<p>None of our backers will be excluded from a special offer after this campaign. Backers with a funding sum $500 will get one of the first <b>SpectraCubes </b>(planned batch is 10 pieces for these backers) with a special plate and their names carved in!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>From our perspective, <b>SpectaCube </b>should be the<b> first official educational device used in schools and universities</b>. We want each student to have her/his own SpectaCube, equipped with the latest IoT gadgets. Therefore it has to meet high-quality and security standards. We are working on this already.</p>

</div><div> <p>The biggest risk is of course, that we would be unable to build the <b>SpectraCube </b>on a broader range because we don't raise enough money. </p>

Before using SpectaCube I aquired almost 40% of the space in our living-room for all my components and gadgets!
Organize your workspace! SpectaCube was at first meant to be something similar to an organizer, to help me to keep my IoT stuff in order, like development-boards components and so on. 
Here are some pictures of the prototype:

And if you think about the investments in terms of money and time, it is important to know that your components are well kept within a safe environment.
SpectraCube helps IoT developers with the management of IoT components like boards and sensors.
Currently the built-in prototype firmware allows you to:


Monitor and manage your development boards
Monitor the SpectraCube working environment
Gather sensor data and visualize the sensor data 
 To connect your sensors to the cloud for testing purposes
To switch your devices on or off
Connectivity and Internet Access 

Another advantage of the built-in firmware is, that it is written in Node.js and C#. This will allow you to develop and test using the tools of your choice.

Hardware Implementation Details


Inner Core



The inner core will be made of anodized blue Aluminium which makes it more resistible, durable and esthetically pleasing. 
The frame will be build using 3-way connectors, made of highly-durable plastics:





Volume Extender Boxes


VEB's allow to extend the available space even further. They are the right place to keep components like resistors, capacitors or small tools. Extenders will be available in three sizes:


20 x 5 x 5 cm's or 7.8"" x 1.9"" x 1.9""  - For larger components or tools
10 x 5 x 5 cm's or  3.9"" x 1.9"" x 1.9"" - For middle sized components
5 x 5  x 5 cm's  or  1.9"" x 1.9"" x 1.9""  - For small components

They have a sophisticated and simple extension plate on the back, that guarantees great stability. It will be and feel just solid.

Here is a stacking example using 10 different VEB's:




The components listed will be available in more color variations and we will add the possibility to bring in your own design ideas and colors. Customize your SpectaCube!

Workbench Characteristics
Laying out all the mounting plates on a table, will give you instantly a possible working environment of 6 times 20 x 20 cm's (400 square cm's) or 6 times 7,87"" (363 square inch) of working space on any flat surface:



Other possible scenarios include presentations, or showcasing new components:



 

Mounting Plates

Mounting plates are another way of extending the SpectaCube and to add new features. The ""Hole Plate"" can be used to mount additional components from the outside or simply on a table. More outer plates are currently designed offering a broad set of new features. 
The soldering plate can be used for soldering. It will have a special ceramic based coating that is extremely durable and heat resistant.
Top-Extenders will be used to allow over-sized components to be placed within SpectaCube. This is a very early design. It will come in more variations with for different usage-scenarios.
The ""Extender"" is designed to carry the VEB's and blade-extensions as well as different other extensions that are currently designed. We will keep you updated about new features and extensions as soon as they are ready.

Power

We are currently evaluating different types of power-supplies, USB-Hubs, battery-Packs, and solar-based extensions. Stay tuned for more details.

Development & Rapid Prototyping

SpectaCube will come with several pre-installed API's for the IoT like the Alljoyn, a custom framework called IoTZen for accelerated testing, a sensor and devices-dashboard and more. Stay tuned for additional updates.




Portable

SpectaCube will be completely portable and ready to go when you need it. We will reveal additional options very soon.

Themable
SpectaCube will allow you to create your own branding and design on each and every component delivered. We are currently speaking to potential partners and we will update you as soon as we know more.

What we will use Your Money for

The first batch of money will be used to produce the first batch of SpectaCube's for our backers and to hire an electronics engineer to evaluate different aspects we need to be evaluated to create a secure and long lasting product.
None of our backers will be excluded from a special offer after this campaign. Backers with a funding sum $500 will get one of the first SpectraCubes (planned batch is 10 pieces for these backers) with a special plate and their names carved in!

Vision
From our perspective, SpectaCube should be the first official educational device used in schools and universities. We want each student to have her/his own SpectaCube, equipped with the latest IoT gadgets. Therefore it has to meet high-quality and security standards. We are working on this already.



As a backer you will not only boost our development, but the future of your children. We are ready and willing to take this responsibility and we will work hard to make this vision true. No child should be excluded from the job-market of tomorrow. Let's work on this together!
Risks & Challenges
 The biggest risk is of course, that we would be unable to build the SpectraCube on a broader range because we don't raise enough money. 
In either case, you can keep your perks and we will keep you on the list and try to fund SpectraCube trough different channels. We are already working on this.

i’m in charge of a team of independent developers involved in the creation of
useful applications to improve people lives




Our goal is to design and implement the
application ImFine.
Why “imFine”?
The problem of security, both in civil and business
environment, takes on an increasing importance nowadays.  Technology can play an important role in the prevention of risks arising from the absence of a constant control
for elderly and children or people who
work in places at risk.

So many times we can not control too close our children while they play,
as it is virtually impossible to control
constantly
the elderly, especially when living alone.

At the same time, work on extended construction
sites causes the inability to control the health and the absence of accidents of individual workers.

How many times happened that your children want to play in the garden and you were unable to
control them?

How many times an elderly fell at home
and was unable to call anybody to be helped?

How
many times,
in a construction
site, an accident was not promptly reported?
Imfine will solve
those problems



Thanks to the accelerometer, GPS and gyroscope , sensors
already present in all smartphones, even medium-low
range, imfine will help you  to keep under control all
the interested subjects.


The application is based, essentially, on the association between two or more devices.

When you associete two or more
smartphone, imfine, through the use of
appropriate sensors, will automatically
alert all the linked devices in case of fall of smartphone’s owner.

Now think to an elder that lives alone. In case of 
fall or accident, the phone
will automatically send to the devices
associated the emergency notification with the
last known position. 



We know that a smartphone, if it is used by a child or by a
worker in a construction site, undergoes many stresses and
accidental falls.

That is why our goal is to build also
an hardware, such as a bracelet, to
be used under a specific network or to be associated
with a “controller” smartphone.

Through the use of a bracelet containing the same sensors of a smartphone such as GPS, gyroscope and
accelerometer,  you have the same chance of detecting possible falls of the subject excluding
""false positives"" case like
the simple fall of the smartphone.


imFine will be equipped with several features based on the needs of the buyer.
All versions will be equipped with a fall
sensor and GPS.
Other features will be designed for the security of individual users of the application.

The bracelet prepared for the children will be equipped with a microphone. If your
child will cry you will be able to notice that.




For the elderly, we will implement  a bracelet
able to control vital parameters and an emergency button.

ImFine
will help you have the freedom to
get away for a moment from your grandparents.  In case of illness, through the emergency
button, your grandparents will be able to alert you.

The same emergency button will be
installed also on imfine “work” version.

The workers will be able to immediately communicate an accident to foreman and relief workers.

ImFine will be also equipped with a function to cancel the emergency signal to avoid incurring in false
alarms, for example, from accidental contact with the emergency button.




We need money to realize 100% working prototype of bracelet, we need to set up a server for realtime notification.
The app will be free on every marketplace and app store.






ImFine will make your life and the lives of your loved ones safer. It will help to ensure that workers on construction sites are fine. Donate a few
dollars to ImFine could help sav. Why not do it?

If the other Glass didn't do much for you, these will. And for a fraction of the price. Faux .Glass is the Glass for the rest of us. Like others, it doesn't do much of anything useful but you'll look ultra cool. Plus, it'll let you send out secret Faux messages that only other Faux users can understand. And if we see you in your Faux on our Faux.Glass site, you're entered in a chance to win a walk down the FashionWare Runway at this year's 2015 CES in Las Vegas.






 



                        Why Faux?
                      












                               Did you ever wish
                                you could be
                                as cool as her?


 















                               Or even him?











  



                        The Wait Is  Over
                      



Like you, we felt pretty left out of the club when asked to plunk down $1500 for the privilege of being an explorer.  So we figured we'd make our own club. 
We created Faux Glass for the other 99% who want to look cool without the pocketbook drain.



  


What is Faux Glass? 



Faux means fake.
But what these glasses lack in functionality they make up for in personality.


  



                        What can you do with Faux?



You can use the series of colored LEDS on the frame  to speak the secret Faux language (found in the Fauxpedia of course!). Examples:


iFaux-to 
                          Snap a memory with the faux camera. You'll never take a bad picture when they're all fake.
 Where the Faux? 
                          It's the special mapping feature that will leave you just as lost as when you use a real GPS.
 Mo-Faux 
                          Show the world that you're the biggest faux of them all.  
                          
                          Want more? 

Use Faux Glass magnifier prism  and light and you'll actually be able to order off a menu in a dark restaurant or beam a friend from across the room.  Faux Glass even has a built in Faux-solar panel to keep you pretending to be re-charging.  The first imaginary energy efficient glasses.

I would like to create an easy to use file sharing solution for everyone in the world.<br/><br/><b>No more boring waiting time with boxy!</b><br/>Usually you have to wait 20 seconds before you can start downloading your file or watching your video clip. I think<br/> it's not a fair thing from a file sharing solution. Imagine that you just clicked on your link and you get your download instantly without<br/> buying any premium account. Boxy file sharing is simple and easy. You click and get what you want instantly. You won't have to close hundreds<br/> of pop-ups. You won't have to wait. There are some advertisements on boxy of course, but not against the usability of the file sharing solution.<br/> We want to create a solution that we too like to use and that everyone like to use, cos it's easy an quick.<br/><br/><b>Premium account?</b><br/>Forget it! You don't need it if you want share files or download anything or use all solutions that boxy offers to you. Usually you can't <br/> use your full bandwidth if you don't pay extra fee for it, but not with boxy. We don't limit your bandwidth. You can upload as quick your <br/> internet connection allow it, and you can download incredible fast your files too. You will be able to use every features if you don't have <br/>premium even.<b><br/><br/>Full bandwidth upload and download!</b><br/>As I wrote up, we wont limit your bandwidth. It's very important if you are a hardcore user. If you want to upload 100GB or 200GB in a few hours, than you can do it if you have quick internet connection. It's just up to you.<br/><br/><b>Modern technology for file sharing</b><br/>I think file sharing includes not only the normal upload and download solutions, but FTP, SFTP or torrent and other things. Boxy allows you to use torrent for uploading or for downloading files and of course you will be able to use FTP. <br/><br/><b>Old pc, slow internet that you have? </b><br/>No problem, we take care about it. Boxy doesn't have large requirements and it will be easy to use from any devices that you have.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We need USD $50,000 to purchase raw materials, pay for molds and tooling, and to get your bag manufactured.  To make the briefcase economical we need economies of scale which means we need volume to meet minimum orders for the briefcase fabrics, clips, PCB boards, integrated circuits, battery, micro-USB cables, adapters, and YKK zippers.<p>              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435932437/tethb4of1w0rolemjgyp.png"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>
<p>We have ten awesome reward categories that fits your generosity and or needs. Anywhere between USD $1 for a virtual thank you, up to USD $790 for 10 Device Charging Briefcases.  Trust us when when saying <b>WE NEED YOUR HELP AND YOU CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE</b> to make this a reality.  If the below categories do not fit your personal needs, perhaps your family, colleagues or friends would love to receive this briefcase as a gift.</p>

<h3>Manufacturing</h3>
<p>We will be producing in China.  And we have lined up a great manufacturer and a group of world class suppliers.  We are based in China so we have immediate and direct access to our manufactures and suppliers.  Which is convenient, we can be in-house during production to manage Quality Control and making sure we meet our quality standards and timelines.</p>
<p>We have very costly upfront costs ( i.e. raw materials, tooling, and minimum order quantities ) and need your help to meet the upfront capital requirements to begin production.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434391007/igkqc5fv29cg2mydijek.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have been working tirelessly for one year to bring you the Legion Concepts Device Charging Briefcase; 16 - 18 hr days, 7 days a week.  We are very passionate to deliver a product we and everyone we speak to believes in and needs.  Upon reaching our funding goal of USD $50,000 we will move into production and be on-site in China to provide quality control.  We plan to begin our first shipments between Mid-October and Mid-November.</p>

<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>After one year creating, improving, and preparing this briefcase, Legion Concepts team is confident to launch a great, functional product into the market.  We have mitigated virtually all risks through out the process, however, there might be unforeseen challenges which may prevent us from delivering the product as previously mentioned. </p>
<p>1st. MANUFACTURING:  Legion Concepts Charging Briefcase cooperates with over ten suppliers.  A fully functional briefcase requires all the suppliers to operate as scheduled.  If unpredictable issues arise with our suppliers the deliver time could be affected.  However, to avoid this risk, we have also prepared Plan B, and C suppliers and manufacturers.</p>
<p>2nd SHIPPING:  We work with a reliable fulfillment center however unforeseen issues could happen during the delivery process.  To lower the impact, we will buy insurance for every package.</p>
<p>3rd BUDGET:  The Ultimate Device Charging Briefcase is the first crowdfunding campaign of Legion Concepts.  To leave customers a good impression, we selected high quality materials while offering low prices.  We did our best to conclude expense at every phase of the process.  </p>

<h3><b>About Charging</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can you provide more details about the extra slim battery?</b></p>
<p>Yes, the battery we are using is a Li - polymer lithium-ion battery which has a higher capacity while taking up less space compared to other batteries.  Here are more specifics of the battery:</p>
<p>-Dimension: 15.3 x 7.35 x 1.45 cm ( 6.02 x 2.89 x 0.57 inches )<br/></p>
<p>-Weight: 0.3 kg ( 0.80 lbs )<br/></p>
<p>-Capacity: 10,000 mAh</p>
<p>-Battery: Li - Polymer lithium-ion battery</p>
<p>-Risk Protections: Short circuit protection, Over-power protection, Over-voltage protection, Over-current protection, Over-charge protection, and High temperature protection.</p>
<p><b>What devices will work with the Charging Briefcase?</b></p>
<p>Just about all of them; Android, iOS, Windows devices, Nokia 5300, Blackberry, E-reader, MP3, and even PSP.  The USB cable output has a Micro USB head which is compatible with most Android devices.  Meanwhile, the adapters we offer  work with most of Android, iOS,  Windows Devices, Nokia 5300, Blackberry, E-reader, MP3, and PSP.</p>
<p><b>How many devices can be charged simultaneously?</b></p>
<p>With two special 2-in-1 USB cables, Legion Concepts offers you to charge three of your devices at the same time.</p>
<p><b>How many times can my devices be charged?</b></p>
<p>Different devices have different battery capacities, so it is hard for us to tell you exactly how many times your devices can be charged.  But here is the formula you  can use to calculate:</p>
<p>Charge times = external charger capacity x external battery conversion rate x phone battery health / phone capacity.</p>
<p>Example: for iPhone 5, the capacity is 1,440 mAh; our conversion rate is 0.85, so the charge times is: 10,000 x 0.85 x 0.9 / 1,440 = 5.3 phone charge times ( plus or minus 0.5 - 1 times). </p>
<p><b>How does the charging system work?</b></p>
<p>To keep all the electronics out of sight, we have built an integrated charging system in the bag.  However, the battery and cables are accessible and removable.  You can simply unzip the dedicated charging system section and thread cables through to take them out or replace them.</p>
<p><b>How can I recharge my briefcase?</b></p>
<p>You can leave the battery inside the briefcase to recharge<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.  With a dedicated USB output pocket on the outer shell of the bag, you can simply pull out the USB output cable from the pocket and charge it with whichever USB port you can find, including computer USB port.</span></p>
<p><strong>How long will the briefcase's battery take to recharge?</strong></p>
<p>About 8-9 hours using a 2 Amp USB charger (Using lower amperage chargers will increase charging time).  However, different charging methods may result in different charging times.  For example, charging from a wall outlet will be faster than charging with a computer USB port.  Environmental temperature, and power flow may also influence the charging time.</p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>About The Briefcase</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>What size laptops will it accommodate?</b></p>
<p>Legion Concepts designed the briefcase to accommodate laptops as big as 17’’.  The laptop section dimensions are 40 x 30 x 4 cm ( 15.7 x 11.8 x 1.5 inches).  Meanwhile, to keep smaller laptops safe, we have padded the laptop section with extra padding.  And the stretch material allows you to put bigger computer in it.</p>
<p><b>What are the dimensions and weight of the Charging Briefcase?</b></p>
<p>Dimensions: 42 x 32 x 12 cm ( 16.5 x 12.6 x 4.7 inches )</p>
<p>Weight: 1.3 kg ( 3.4 lbs ).</p>
<p><b>Is the briefcase water resistant?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we have put a water resistant coating on the 1680 D ballistic nylon outer shell to keep water out.  ( note: water resistant is not water proof ).</p>
<p><b>How much stuff can I put in the briefcase?</b></p>
<p>Legion Concepts Charging Briefcase has 4 compartments.  A dedicated computer section is TSA friendly.  There are also numerous pockets to put in different items, such as: three phones pockets ( iPhone 6 Plus or smaller ), one tablet ( iPad Air fits in it ), computer cord, mouse, external hard drive, passport, name cards, airplane tickets, pens and keys.  The middle section in the bag can also accommodate a change of clothes, notebooks, and documents. </p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>About Shipping</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Do I add the shipping fee to the pledge amount or is it charged later?</b></p>
<p>Please enter your shipping address and the shipping fee will be automatic included.</p>
<p><b>Do I need to pay for tariff?</b></p>
<p>For the U.S., our product value is less than 200 USD, so it is less likely to generate a tariff.  For Germany, France and England, there is a chance that there will be a tariff. Example Amount: ( product value x exchange rate – 21 euro ) x 0.2, i.e: ( 100 x 0.8885 – 21 ) x 0.2 = 13.57 euro.  Tariff may differ due to different country custom policies.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing The Ultimate Device Charging BriefcaseLegion Concepts, has developed a high quality Device Charging Briefcase that offers a new communication experience and delivers a great day-to-day economical travel solution. In The Media

Shanghai-based Legion Concept has launched a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo this week for its ultimate device charging briefcase.
Legion’s briefcase features a 10,000mAh removable battery that is able to charge smartphones five times and tablets once. Because of the battery, you can charge devices on the go, which means no more hunting for free outlets at airports and cafes.“People who utilize smartphones to the full potential need to recharge after a few hours, and in-device battery capacity is just too small,” said Michael Bates, Founder and CEO of Legion Concepts. “Many of us have become outlet huggers, so our goal is to liberate people from outlets and give freedom to our daily lives; for power users this briefcase really is lifestyle insurance.” - Mellisa Tolentino

Briefcase Features
1.  DEVICE CHARGING

Charge three of your devices simultaneously on-the-go!  With a 10,000 mAh integrated removable battery, the Legion Concepts briefcase can charge most smartphones over 5 times, and tablet over 1 time.   With four charging pockets, you can charge three of your devices simultaneously whenever and wherever you want. 



2.  iOS & ANDROID COMPATIBLE



We all use different types of devices and sometimes they need to be charged simultaneously.  Legion Concepts charging briefcase contains a set of adapters to suit your demands.  Adapters work with Android, iOS, Windows, Blackberry,  Nokia 5300, E-readers, and PSP.


3.  BAG-TO-WALL CHARGING


Recharging your briefcase is a snap.  With a dedicated briefcase charging pocket and cable, simply pull out the USB charging cable and plug into any outlet.  



4.  USB CABLE MANAGEMENT


Keep your cables organized and out-of-sight.  The whole charging system is integrated in the briefcase.  Yet, it is also easy for you to access them.  Simply unzip the dedicated battery section and weave charging cables through cable pass throughs.



5.  TSA PASS FRIENDLY



Traveling with your laptop just got easier by keeping your laptop inside your briefcase during TSA X-ray screening at the airport.  A specially designed computer section helps you pass through airport security in a breeze.


6.  ORGANIZATION REFINED




With numerous pockets, you now can organize your business travel!  Files, clothing, cellphones, tablets, name cards, passport, tickets.  A place for everything.








Briefcase MaterialsWe have sourced materials from over 10 suppliers and worked with them for over a year to provide high quality material with economical cost structures.















What We Need & What You GetWe need USD $50,000 to purchase raw materials, pay for molds and tooling, and to get your bag manufactured.  To make the briefcase economical we need economies of scale which means we need volume to meet minimum orders for the briefcase fabrics, clips, PCB boards, integrated circuits, battery, micro-USB cables, adapters, and YKK zippers.              
We have ten awesome reward categories that fits your generosity and or needs. Anywhere between USD $1 for a virtual thank you, up to USD $790 for 10 Device Charging Briefcases.  Trust us when when saying WE NEED YOUR HELP AND YOU CAN MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE to make this a reality.  If the below categories do not fit your personal needs, perhaps your family, colleagues or friends would love to receive this briefcase as a gift.

















Manufacturing
We will be producing in China.  And we have lined up a great manufacturer and a group of world class suppliers.  We are based in China so we have immediate and direct access to our manufactures and suppliers.  Which is convenient, we can be in-house during production to manage Quality Control and making sure we meet our quality standards and timelines.
We have very costly upfront costs ( i.e. raw materials, tooling, and minimum order quantities ) and need your help to meet the upfront capital requirements to begin production.  


Timeline

We have been working tirelessly for one year to bring you the Legion Concepts Device Charging Briefcase; 16 - 18 hr days, 7 days a week.  We are very passionate to deliver a product we and everyone we speak to believes in and needs.  Upon reaching our funding goal of USD $50,000 we will move into production and be on-site in China to provide quality control.  We plan to begin our first shipments between Mid-October and Mid-November.

Risks
After one year creating, improving, and preparing this briefcase, Legion Concepts team is confident to launch a great, functional product into the market.  We have mitigated virtually all risks through out the process, however, there might be unforeseen challenges which may prevent us from delivering the product as previously mentioned. 
1st. MANUFACTURING:  Legion Concepts Charging Briefcase cooperates with over ten suppliers.  A fully functional briefcase requires all the suppliers to operate as scheduled.  If unpredictable issues arise with our suppliers the deliver time could be affected.  However, to avoid this risk, we have also prepared Plan B, and C suppliers and manufacturers.
2nd SHIPPING:  We work with a reliable fulfillment center however unforeseen issues could happen during the delivery process.  To lower the impact, we will buy insurance for every package.
3rd BUDGET:  The Ultimate Device Charging Briefcase is the first crowdfunding campaign of Legion Concepts.  To leave customers a good impression, we selected high quality materials while offering low prices.  We did our best to conclude expense at every phase of the process.

Hi, my name is Charles.
Products that make our homes safer are always needed.

Key control adds security for your home. If you are elderly, if you are home alone, if you lost your keys or if you just want to feel safer when you are in your home. Key control is the solution; Key control will stop any key from unlocking your door(s) when you are at home. The dead bolt cannot be unlocked only when you are at home and you are using Key Control.  Unexpected company with a key; use Key Control.




What We Need & What You Get

The fastest print possible. But this isn't child's play, we give you full control over your slicer settings. The Raspberry Pi is overclocked for performance, so you'll never have printing issues.As easy as Plug-and-PlayWith PrintToPeer, when you first connect your Raspberry Pi to your 3D printer, it just works! The network is automatically configured, your 3D printer is recognized, driver updates are seamlessly integrated, and slicer settings are pre-configured so you are ready to print.A simple yet powerful interfacePrintToPeer is designed for a beginner, and configured for a pro. We want to make the print process as seamless as possible for when you just want a print to work on the first try. And fast when you have your slice profiles configured.The maintenance console is a re-imagination of what a print driver could look like. Tutorials will take you through the steps of calibrating your 3D printer, and changing your filament.With a filament catalog, your settings are shared with the crowd. These include  speed, flow rate and temperature offsets. You no longer need to look up the temperatures required, because filament settings are stored with which printer it was used on. And with ratings, you’ll know which settings have been vetted by the community.Share your 3D printer with friendsIt has never been more important to share 3D printers because the technology is coming into classrooms and offices. Ethernet was made specifically for sharing a printer in an office, so why don’t 3D printers have it? We are hosted on the web, you can easily add another user to your account.STL files are on the web, your 3D printer should be tooIt has never been easier to find free 3D printable objects online in marketplaces like Thingiverse and YouMagine. All you want is to send the design to your 3D printer, but instead you need to process the files on your computer. What if the files were repaired and sliced on the web and sent straight to your 3D printer?PrintToPeer gives you a web dashboard for your 3D printer that lets you upload STL files, or import them from other web services.Mobile friendlyYou are always on the go, and prints can take a long time, so we know how important it is for your printer to be available from anywhere. Your slicer settings will always be with you, and so will realtime stats.NotificationsYour 3D printer can send you status updates over SMS or email when your print is finished or if any problems happened during the print.Monitor your camera remotelyYou can watch your print on the web interface from anywhere, all you need is a camera module attached to your Raspberry Pi. If it is a long print and you are concerned it might fail, we can monitor your feed for you and pause the print if anything appears to be unusual. When the print is complete a photo can be automatically shared with your friends.How it worksCloud slicing done right, and fastPerformance is important to us. We host Slic3r, Cura, and Makerbot slicers on powerful servers that are always fast and available. So you no longer need to have a beastly computer slicing your files at home. Access your slicer profiles from anywhere and share them with others. Our database of slicer settings will improve over time, and by tracking failure rates we can offer you the most reliable slicer settings for your specific 3D printer.Real time, all the timeWe knew that there could be no delay for commands and feedback since these are motors we are controlling. PrintToPeer is built with real time websocket communication to give you high resolution data and analytics.Open source at heartOpen source drives innovation, and we wouldn’t be here without a few key open source projects. So we are giving back to the community by keeping our entire Raspberry Pi codebase open source. We put principles before profit and will be contributing to the success of other projects.We have taken the same approach as Android, keeping our backend services (queueing, slicing, slice profiles) closed, customizable, and high quality. But with our stretch goal, the server-side code will be open source too!Secure from the startRemotely accessing your 3D printer could be a security nightmare, but it's not. From the ground up, all of our connections are made over secure connections using SSL.Developer-FriendlyBuild on top of our platformThe future of 3D printing will be created on top of feature-rich open APIs. We built PrintToPeer to be developer-friendly so you can build on top of our platform. This is new territory, and we are excited to see what you create.A common API for all 3D printersYou shouldn’t need to know how endstops work to integrate 3D printing in your application. We have abstracted away the lower level details of the different printing processes, so that you can send an object to a generalized 3D printer.Adding wireless 3D printing to your apps is easyWith a simple RESTful or WebSocket based API, a PrintToPeer user can 3D print right from your apps. You can query which printers are connected with which filament, send objects to the printerGet early accessSign up at printtopeer.io/developer to get early access to the PrintToPeer API so you can start building apps for 3D printers.Proven to PrintHere's what people are saying“This is the way of the future.

  The funding is important to pay for additional programming to refine the app, but equally important are ideas on what other uses exist for this technology.  Every time I talk to someone about what we are doing, they come up with another use that we haven't thought of.  Please help us find the best uses for the technology and also to prioritize our development efforts.  We are creating a Beta Group that will get first releases of each app developed and also will be responsible for determining the future direction of the company! All monies raised during this funding will go to programming development of the app.  The amount of the funding is the budget assessment for programming effort between now and March 2015.  Any shortage in funding will be made up by the team, so the app will go forward as scheduled no matter what.    Racing Fans
 I know that our first app is geared towards fun.  I am one of the 650 million auto racing fans worldwide.  This may seem like just another fun app that we have on our phones, but the implication of the technology includes many other uses.  A few that have been mentioned are; Coaching Aid for Sports, Forensic Analysis and Horse Training.
How does it work?

The app uses Object Detection and Background Segmentation to track the moving car through the video.  Then, within thresholds defined by the Library, it determines scale and combines that with the video tracking to determine speed!  SIMPLE!

placed in the home as a dedicated phone line to reach 911 in the event of an
emergency. </p>
<p>Best of all with <b>The 911 Phone</b>
there are no phone subscription to pay; all calls to 911 are free and there are
no carrier fees, monthly fees, subscriber fees, yearly fees, landline fees or
any cost to use the phone. This is possible because in the U.S., FCC rules
require telephone carriers to connect 9-1-1 calls from any cell phone,
regardless of whether that phone is currently active.</p><p><b>The 911 Phone</b> is specially
designed to look like a home phone and is conveniently placed in the home and
is wall or desk mounted.</p>
<p>In the event of an emergency <b>The
911 Phone</b> is easy to locate by children, seniors and others in the home where
every second counts. <b>The 911 Phone</b> always stays on; is charged and works even
in a power outage. </p>
<p>Many people who look at <b>The 911 Phone</b>
simply say that they have a cell phone and so do others in their household so
why would they need this product. The answer is that in the event of an
emergency every second counts and is critical in saving a life. Different
scenarios include people usually put phone at different locations in the
home and in an emergency they tend to panic and forget where their cell phone
was placed; or forgot that their cell phone is in the car, office or other location. Other
scenarios include low or dead battery; weak signal caused by low battery or phone
is not accessible by children, elderly family members or others in the
home.</p>
<p><b>The 911 Phone</b> is similar to having
a home fire extinguisher, first-aid kit, smoke detectors or other inexpensive safety
fixtures in the home. They generally do not move and you know where they are
located, in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p><b>Benefits</b></p><p>• No Contracts<br/><br/>• No Monthly Fees <br/><br/>• No Service Fees    
</p><p>• No Landline Needed
</p><p>• Works in Power Outages     
</p><p>• Find Phone Easily in an Emergency
</p><p>• Never Worry About Low or Dead Battery <br/><br/>• Works with any Cell Phone</p><p><b><br/>The Prototype Process</b></p><p>To
 make a fully functioning working prototype we first had to get an 
engineer to design our product from the few computer visuals we provided
 him with. From this he produced 3D CAD (computer-aided design) images 
that allowed us to see the product on the computer in a three 
dimensional way. We made changes and the process went back and fourth 
until we were satisfied with its overall appearance, size and shape. 
During this time frame we also filed a patent application with the 
United States Patent and Trademark Office to seek protection on our 
product.   </p><p>The next process was to bring our three dimensional 
images to life and make a real part that we could have in our hand to 
test. We found a local company in South Florida that specializes with 
prototypes to help us. In only a few days the prototype was made using 
high
grade ABS plastic through a 3D Rapid Prototyping process.</p><p>Our prototype has brought <b>The 911 Phone</b> to real life and allowed us to test
the overall look and functionality of the product; how it feels; how much it
weighs; the dimensions; the overall aesthetics and to test how different cell
phones work with the product.</p><p>The case size is 7.5 inches
height by 2.75 inches width and this ideal size was determined after careful
research of all the different current and past cell phone models. This insures that
our product will work with the majority of cell phones in circulation. </p>
<p>Since the cell phone in the case
is always plugged into wall charger, the case has an opening on bottom 
(for phones
that charger plugs into top or bottom) as well as push out tabs on side 
of case
(for phones that charge from the sides). For prototype we made 1 tab on 
each side of case but after in depth testing with over 200 cell phones 
(new and old), we added another tab on side and adjusted the spacing of 
tabs to accommodate the various plug placement. </p>
<p>Phone is easily placed and
removed from case with the use of Velcro (placed on back of phone and inside case). This allows
the phone to easily be removed in the event of an emergency. <br/><br/></p><p><b>Photos of Prototype</b></p><p><i></i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/432344/files/20140313195327-The_911_Phone__1_.png?1394765607"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Case<b> </b>Closed (wall mounted)<br/><br/></i></p><p></p><p><i></i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/432347/files/20140313195409-The_911_Phone__2_.png?1394765649"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Case Opened (angle view)</i><br/><br/><i></i></p><p></p><p><i></i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/432349/files/20140313195440-The_911_Phone__3_.png?1394765680"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Case Opened (front view)<br/><br/></i></p><p></p><p><i></i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/432350/files/20140313195504-The_911_Phone__4_.png?1394765704"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Case Closed (side view)<br/><br/></i></p><p></p><p>

phones every 18 months. In the U.S., between 100 million and 130 million
 cell phones are thrown away each year, representing an estimated 65,000
 tons of electronics waste.<p></p><p>• More than half of U.S. homes do not have landline phone service.</p><p>•
 An estimated 240 million calls are made to 9-1-1 in the U.S. each year.
 According to the FCC, one-third are wireless calls; in many 
communities, it’s one-half or more of all 9-1-1 calls. </p><p><b><br/>The Production Process</b></p><p><b>The 911 Phone</b> finished product will be made of polypropylene (pp) plastic.The world of plastic is not a cut
and dried one. There are around 45 different types of plastic and each one has
its own properties and uses, from commercial to residential. Polypropylene is
a durable plastic that is used in a wide range of commercial products found in the marketplace, due to its
wide variety of benefits.</p><p>To manufacture finished units of <b>The 911 Phone</b>
 a mold must be fabricated. We have shopped around with many vendors in 
the U.S. to not only find a mold maker but also a company that will 
handle production of the product for us. After many quotes, we found a 
company in our own area (South Florida), where we can drive to and meet 
at their office/warehouse and be hands on with our product. This company
 has over 25 years of experience in making molds and in the production 
of finished products. They have a partnership with a company in China 
that allows them to offer the low manufacturing costs of oversees 
production while also offering the personalized service found locally.</p><p>The
 most expensive part of any product production is tooling. This is the 
initial investment to make the product mold where all units will be made
 from and is made from steel. It is estimated that it will take 30 - 45 
days to complete the mold for <b>The 911 Phone </b>and will cost $14,200
 to produce. With this mold we are guaranteed by the company that it 
will be durable and able to produce a few hundred thousand units during 
the life cycle of the mold.</p><p>
</p><p><i></i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/432427/files/20140313202455-Sample_Mold.png?1394767495"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>For any product found in the marketplace a mold must
first be made. The above example is a mold made for the production of car door
handles.</i></p><p></p>
<br/><br/>After the mold is completed, the production of <b>The 911 Phone</b> 
units will take place. This is done using injection molding which is the
 most
commonly used manufacturing process for the fabrication of plastic 
parts. Raw
plastic material is melted in an injection molding machine and injected 
into the mold, where it cools and solidifies into the final part.<p></p><p>The
 minimum number of units that we need to start production is 2,500 units
 and the total cost to do this $7,300. The manufacturer estimates that 
it will take 25 - 40 days to produce the units and another 3 weeks to be
 shipped from China to Miami. </p><p><b>Indiegogo Campaign</b></p><p>Now it’s time to raise the funds ($26,500) to bring <b>The 911 Phone </b>product
 to life. To start production, we need to produce the mold ($14,200); a 
minimum of
 2,500 units ($7,300) and we are offering FREE SHIPPING worldwide 
($5,000) to our Indiegogo backers, but we don’t have the funds to do 
that by
 ourselves. This is where you come in. Please be our partner.</p><p>Breakdown:</p><p>• Product Mold ($14,200)<br/>• Minimum order of 2,500 units ($7,300)<br/>• Free Shipping of product to Indiegogo backers ($5,000)<br/><br/>Total: $26,500</p><p>We
 have a precise timeline of when we will receive the finished product 
from our manufacturer. We will be ready to ship out all orders 
immediately. We are certain that no matter how many orders we get, we 
will be able to deliver on schedule. </p><p>From the product 
engineering, product mold, product production, manufacturer to the 
shipping, everything is lined up and ready to go. We have taken every 
step we can to make sure that <b>The 911 Phone</b> is delivered to your door as fast as possible. Now all we need is your help.</p><p><br/><b>Timelines Challenges </b><br/></p><p>With every new project in life comes goals, timelines and deadlines 
to meet. We also know that nothing in life is certain and there with 
always be challenges and obstacles along the way.</p>
<p>That being said we are confident that we have done our due diligence 
in learning the production process and everything we can about the 
product we want to produce and offer to the public. We are also 
confident that we are using an experienced and well respected company 
for the product mold and final product production. 
<br/><br/>A few of the challenges that could present itself are:</p>
<p>• Mold price could potentially go up slightly due to higher steel 
cost. (The quote we got is for now and when the project is finally 
funded it might change slightly.)</p>
<p>• Production could potentially goes up slightly due to higher plastic
 cost. (The quote we got is for now and when the project is finally 
funded it might change slightly.)</p>
<p>• There might be small delays in producing the mold in 30 - 45 days; 
final production of units in 25 - 40 days; shipment coming from China in
 3 weeks or all orders going out immediately (2 - 3 weeks) from us to 
Indiegogo backers.</p>
<p>We are confident that any delays or potential obstacles that do arise
 will be met by us and we will do whatever in our power to correct.  </p>

placed in the home as a dedicated phone line to reach 911 in the event of an
emergency. 
Best of all with The 911 Phone
there are no phone subscription to pay; all calls to 911 are free and there are
no carrier fees, monthly fees, subscriber fees, yearly fees, landline fees or
any cost to use the phone. This is possible because in the U.S., FCC rules
require telephone carriers to connect 9-1-1 calls from any cell phone,
regardless of whether that phone is currently active.The 911 Phone is specially
designed to look like a home phone and is conveniently placed in the home and
is wall or desk mounted.
In the event of an emergency The
911 Phone is easy to locate by children, seniors and others in the home where
every second counts. The 911 Phone always stays on; is charged and works even
in a power outage. 
Many people who look at The 911 Phone
simply say that they have a cell phone and so do others in their household so
why would they need this product. The answer is that in the event of an
emergency every second counts and is critical in saving a life. Different
scenarios include people usually put phone at different locations in the
home and in an emergency they tend to panic and forget where their cell phone
was placed; or forgot that their cell phone is in the car, office or other location. Other
scenarios include low or dead battery; weak signal caused by low battery or phone
is not accessible by children, elderly family members or others in the
home.
The 911 Phone is similar to having
a home fire extinguisher, first-aid kit, smoke detectors or other inexpensive safety
fixtures in the home. They generally do not move and you know where they are
located, in the event of an emergency.
Benefits• No Contracts• No Monthly Fees • No Service Fees    
• No Landline Needed
• Works in Power Outages     
• Find Phone Easily in an Emergency
• Never Worry About Low or Dead Battery • Works with any Cell PhoneThe Prototype ProcessTo
 make a fully functioning working prototype we first had to get an 
engineer to design our product from the few computer visuals we provided
 him with. From this he produced 3D CAD (computer-aided design) images 
that allowed us to see the product on the computer in a three 
dimensional way. We made changes and the process went back and fourth 
until we were satisfied with its overall appearance, size and shape. 
During this time frame we also filed a patent application with the 
United States Patent and Trademark Office to seek protection on our 
product.   The next process was to bring our three dimensional 
images to life and make a real part that we could have in our hand to 
test. We found a local company in South Florida that specializes with 
prototypes to help us. In only a few days the prototype was made using 
high
grade ABS plastic through a 3D Rapid Prototyping process.Our prototype has brought The 911 Phone to real life and allowed us to test
the overall look and functionality of the product; how it feels; how much it
weighs; the dimensions; the overall aesthetics and to test how different cell
phones work with the product.The case size is 7.5 inches
height by 2.75 inches width and this ideal size was determined after careful
research of all the different current and past cell phone models. This insures that
our product will work with the majority of cell phones in circulation. 
Since the cell phone in the case
is always plugged into wall charger, the case has an opening on bottom 
(for phones
that charger plugs into top or bottom) as well as push out tabs on side 
of case
(for phones that charge from the sides). For prototype we made 1 tab on 
each side of case but after in depth testing with over 200 cell phones 
(new and old), we added another tab on side and adjusted the spacing of 
tabs to accommodate the various plug placement. 
Phone is easily placed and
removed from case with the use of Velcro (placed on back of phone and inside case). This allows
the phone to easily be removed in the event of an emergency. Photos of PrototypeCase Closed (wall mounted)Case Opened (angle view)Case Opened (front view)Case Closed (side view)

shopEarly Stage PhotosIn designing The 911 Phone we started with the idea that the case that houses the emergency cell phone should resemble a house telephone casing.
We complied a lot of homephones to take measurements and
compare case sizing and features.Narrowed down search to a few slimline designs and took
phones apart to examine.

Interesting Statistics• On average, American cell phone subscribers replace their cell 
phones every 18 months. In the U.S., between 100 million and 130 million
 cell phones are thrown away each year, representing an estimated 65,000
 tons of electronics waste.• More than half of U.S. homes do not have landline phone service.•
 An estimated 240 million calls are made to 9-1-1 in the U.S. each year.
 According to the FCC, one-third are wireless calls; in many 
communities, it’s one-half or more of all 9-1-1 calls. The Production ProcessThe 911 Phone finished product will be made of polypropylene (pp) plastic.The world of plastic is not a cut
and dried one. There are around 45 different types of plastic and each one has
its own properties and uses, from commercial to residential. Polypropylene is
a durable plastic that is used in a wide range of commercial products found in the marketplace, due to its
wide variety of benefits.To manufacture finished units of The 911 Phone
 a mold must be fabricated. We have shopped around with many vendors in 
the U.S. to not only find a mold maker but also a company that will 
handle production of the product for us. After many quotes, we found a 
company in our own area (South Florida), where we can drive to and meet 
at their office/warehouse and be hands on with our product. This company
 has over 25 years of experience in making molds and in the production 
of finished products. They have a partnership with a company in China 
that allows them to offer the low manufacturing costs of oversees 
production while also offering the personalized service found locally.The
 most expensive part of any product production is tooling. This is the 
initial investment to make the product mold where all units will be made
 from and is made from steel. It is estimated that it will take 30 - 45 
days to complete the mold for The 911 Phone and will cost $14,200
 to produce. With this mold we are guaranteed by the company that it 
will be durable and able to produce a few hundred thousand units during 
the life cycle of the mold.
For any product found in the marketplace a mold must
first be made. The above example is a mold made for the production of car door
handles.
After the mold is completed, the production of The 911 Phone 
units will take place. This is done using injection molding which is the
 most
commonly used manufacturing process for the fabrication of plastic 
parts. Raw
plastic material is melted in an injection molding machine and injected 
into the mold, where it cools and solidifies into the final part.The
 minimum number of units that we need to start production is 2,500 units
 and the total cost to do this $7,300. The manufacturer estimates that 
it will take 25 - 40 days to produce the units and another 3 weeks to be
 shipped from China to Miami. Indiegogo CampaignNow it’s time to raise the funds ($26,500) to bring The 911 Phone product
 to life. To start production, we need to produce the mold ($14,200); a 
minimum of
 2,500 units ($7,300) and we are offering FREE SHIPPING worldwide 
($5,000) to our Indiegogo backers, but we don’t have the funds to do 
that by
 ourselves. This is where you come in. Please be our partner.Breakdown:• Product Mold ($14,200)• Minimum order of 2,500 units ($7,300)• Free Shipping of product to Indiegogo backers ($5,000)Total: $26,500We
 have a precise timeline of when we will receive the finished product 
from our manufacturer. We will be ready to ship out all orders 
immediately. We are certain that no matter how many orders we get, we 
will be able to deliver on schedule. From the product 
engineering, product mold, product production, manufacturer to the 
shipping, everything is lined up and ready to go. We have taken every 
step we can to make sure that The 911 Phone is delivered to your door as fast as possible. Now all we need is your help.Timelines Challenges With every new project in life comes goals, timelines and deadlines 
to meet. We also know that nothing in life is certain and there with 
always be challenges and obstacles along the way.
That being said we are confident that we have done our due diligence 
in learning the production process and everything we can about the 
product we want to produce and offer to the public. We are also 
confident that we are using an experienced and well respected company 
for the product mold and final product production. 
A few of the challenges that could present itself are:
• Mold price could potentially go up slightly due to higher steel 
cost. (The quote we got is for now and when the project is finally 
funded it might change slightly.)
• Production could potentially goes up slightly due to higher plastic
 cost. (The quote we got is for now and when the project is finally 
funded it might change slightly.)
• There might be small delays in producing the mold in 30 - 45 days; 
final production of units in 25 - 40 days; shipment coming from China in
 3 weeks or all orders going out immediately (2 - 3 weeks) from us to 
Indiegogo backers.
We are confident that any delays or potential obstacles that do arise
 will be met by us and we will do whatever in our power to correct.  
Timeline:
3/20/14 - Indiegogog funding period begins
5/10/14 - Indiegogo funding period ends
5/19/14 – Start the creation of product mold. 
6/19/14 - Start production of first 2,500 units of The 911 Phone.
8/10/14 - Package and mail product to Indiegogo supporters. 
We plan on doing whatever it takes to ship by or before 8/31/14

<p></p><p></p></div>","DIMPLE is a small sticker or protective case with user-configurable buttons that you attach to the rear side of your Android NFC-enabled gadgets. Buttons can launch apps, change settings, turn on the flashlight and much, much more. You can double the button count by assigning a long-press function.AVAILABLE COLORS:DIMPLE STANDARD & MINI PRODUCT WORKS ONLY WITH ANDROID 4.0+ NFC-ENABLED GADGETS (EXCLUDES HTC ONE M7 & M8 and other metal devices), FOR HTC ONE COMPATIBILITY, PLEASE CHOOSE THE PROTECTIVE CASE OPTION.(Buttons below will not work if you read this on a mobile device)Attached in close proximity (even over a case) to your device’s NFC reader, DIMPLE lets you extend the functionality to your own liking, from launching your favorite social network app, to launching sophisticated Tasker tasks or your own developed plugins through DIMPLE API.„If
the final product is half as good as it sounds, it's likely to be a big hit.” CNET 

„The DIMPLE goes above and beyond the call of duty with a
set of four easy-to-install buttons that can be customized to do almost
anything you want.” GIZMODO

„What makes the DIMPLE stand out from solutions like Pressy
is that you don’t have to sacrifice anything to use it.” AndroidAuthority

„These days most smartphones only have buttons for the most
crucial of tasks. Some of us still prefer having hardware buttons. DIMPLE aims
to fill that gap.” Ubergizmo
„DIMPLE.IO is a project that is likely going to make a lot
of Android users very happy, because it adds four buttons to your device that
you can do whatever you want with.” GEEK

You define your experience with DIMPLE, from controlling what each button will do, to its  placement according to your own ergonomics. DIMPLE is designed to give you total control over its functionality and to fit your personal needs and requirements.The ""One size fits all"" approach rarely truly works. We believe that everyone- from the average Joe to power users - should have the ability to customize their gadgets just the way they want them without ever picking up a drill or an axe. We approached the user experience with DIMPLE with the following principles in mind:Customization should not be intimidating or difficult. This is why we designed DIMPLE to be quick to set up and use right out of the box. The companion app user interface is incredibly easy to understand, even though it packs a lot of advanced features. Application of DIMPLE is super easy, and you have a thingy called ""training wheels"" to try and feel the best location to apply the dimple. If you have ever applied a sticker without burning a house down, you will be able to apply DIMPLE. If you can use a smartphone, you can use DIMPLE.Every human is built differently, though we still get to use the same gadgets. Heck, if you are left-handed, you probably sometimes think that the world has turned on you. No more. You can apply the DIMPLE sticker in practically unlimited positions in close proximity to the NFC antenna of your device. For most gadgets, this means all of the rear side; for tablets and phablets- just a part of the rear side. The DIMPLE offers tactile feedback- hear a ""click"" on every push of a button in addition to haptic feedback. Every button has a patented groove around it with a braille dimple in the middle. Your fingers will be able to distinct each button in any situation. Functionality means different things to different people. So we did not want to design a rigid one-solution-fits-everyone product. Instead we spent many months in the dark actually developing an application that will never be finished in a sense of constant evolution. The Beta, which will suit every need of the average user, is already online.

<p>We’re Troy, Dan, Marcie and Adiclere - the names and faces behind <a href=""http://listsanity.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ListSanity.com</a> - a small team that has bootstrapped our project to get it on the web. And now we want to bring ListSanity to smart phones so that users can enjoy the full functionality from anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>What’s ListSanity and Why Should It Go Mobile? </strong></p>
<p>ListSanity is an online platform where you can create, store and share Lists about anything and everything. When other people contribute or vote on your List we take all the versions, add a little math and come up with an authoritative PopuList – so you’ll know who’s right and who’s wrong once and for all. ListSanity is a great way to learn new things about your friends, meet new people with similar interests, or just waste time. </p>
<p>Since our launch the number one thing we’ve been hearing from our users (well, number two after how awesome ListSanity is) is that they <strong>need a mobile version!</strong> </p>
<p>Many of our users share Lists via Twitter – and right now it’s not super easy to see or make Lists via your smartphone. So we want to develop an HTML5 version of our website that can be downloaded to any smartphone (Android, iOs, Windows, RIM) and used on the go. The mobile app will let you get notifications about changes to your Lists, challenges or even create new Lists that have pressing importance (What color shirt should I wear on my first date?) With a mobile app you’ll even be able to store Lists for everyday use – think grocery Lists or to-do Lists. But mostly, it’s about the fun you can have making Lists about everything else. </p>
<p><strong>What if we raise more money than we need?</strong> </p>
<p>After we celebrate and of course complete the mobile app our next project is the Facebook app.  We believe that ListSanity will see crazy growth if users don’t have to leave Facebook to do a List.  Any extra funding over our goal will go to the development of a ListSanity Facebook App.</p>
<p><strong>What if we raise less money than we need?</strong></p>
<p>We hope that's not the case but if it is ... we will start with two cans and a string and try to get the mobile app done....but it might take a really really long time. </p>
<p><strong>Our Team has the experience to make it a reality.</strong></p>
<p>We can really do it ourselves! One of our founders is a designer with mobile app experience (Marcie) and another is a developer with mobile app experience (Dan). We don't have to go out and find someone to do this who might try and hold us over a barrel for more money. We're committed to doing it ourselves and getting it done quickly. Unfortunately, none of us are independently wealthy, so we just need the money so that the programing team can give up some paying gigs to get this done. </p>
<p>We’ve laid out a realistic development roadmap that will help us get the project out the door and on to your phone. Most importantly, this project is near and dear to our hearts, because this is what the people want – the sooner we finish the mobile app the sooner we can make everyone happy and move on to other parts of the project that are keeping us awake at night. </p>
<p><strong>What more info? </strong></p>
<p>For updates and a little flavor of our team personality check out our blog at <a href=""http://www.listsanity.com/info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.listsanity.com/info</a>. If you’re interested in some more specifics about what we intend to offer in the mobile app it’ll help if you first head on over to our website and check it out. Then visit our info page for a development roadmap that gives you a breakdown of how we’re building the app and what you can expect. </p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
</div>
<div id=""risks"">
<p>The greatest challenge with creating the mobile app is controlling feature creep to keep development on track. We know that we can't have all the features out of the gate so the goal will be to prioritize those that we believe are most important to the basic functionality of the site while giving users enough to satisfy their ListSanity fix.</p>
<p>We plan on locking down our dev roadmap before we begin building the app. We've spent a lot of time thinking about features based on user feedback and we're confident that we'll be able to come up with a spec that we'll be happy to carry throughout the project.</p>
<p>Should a feature arise that the team agrees is truly necessary to add after we've locked our feature set, Dan will take time from his other projects to focus on meeting our initial goals. If that's not a possibility we'll reevaluate the features to see if the new feature can replace one that hasn't yet been developed.</p>
<p>Hopefully these aren't really a concern. We've all worked on enough projects that we know feature creep is the enemy of the productive. We're pretty set on getting something to market as quickly as possible (for example, look at the quick two and a half months it took to get our open beta for the website).</p>
<p>Either way, we'll keep you updated on our blog and via messages if there are real problems! No one wants this mobile app as much as we do!</p>

Either way, we'll keep you updated on our blog and via messages if there are real problems! No one wants this mobile app as much as we do!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>   Anystreaming is not a perfectly finished product. We are looking forward to make better one with better performance and design. In order to do this, we need way more product tests and user’s actual feedback. And Indiegogo gives us chance to do that for us (your opinion is very important to us). <br/>  So far, the developed the Anystreaming board can real-time streaming video that has very low latency. It is enough performance for streaming video now. However, we will need to develop the Anystreaming for enjoying the games because it would be better to have lower latency environment for the games than the video streaming. For this, we give a challenge to ourselves to have an optimized hardware and software than before. We need a lot of expenses for the mass production, and those mass product needs to get many certifications which incur more costs. Most of the startup companies have this cost aspects problems and because of that, we need your help to decrease the risk of the problem. <br/>  We will do our best to ship the product to your door on time. However, if there are any problems with it, we will let you know immediately and we will do everything to solve the problem.</p>

Risks and challenges
   Anystreaming is not a perfectly finished product. We are looking forward to make better one with better performance and design. In order to do this, we need way more product tests and user’s actual feedback. And Indiegogo gives us chance to do that for us (your opinion is very important to us).   So far, the developed the Anystreaming board can real-time streaming video that has very low latency. It is enough performance for streaming video now. However, we will need to develop the Anystreaming for enjoying the games because it would be better to have lower latency environment for the games than the video streaming. For this, we give a challenge to ourselves to have an optimized hardware and software than before. We need a lot of expenses for the mass production, and those mass product needs to get many certifications which incur more costs. Most of the startup companies have this cost aspects problems and because of that, we need your help to decrease the risk of the problem.   We will do our best to ship the product to your door on time. However, if there are any problems with it, we will let you know immediately and we will do everything to solve the problem.",25.0,9,"3 Campaigns

Work with a real person , share ideas and experiences.
None of parties are paying any % to ad network ...which means ....lower prices.
You know where you ad is going to run....pick an app related to your product ..higher chances of conversions
You can buy a ""whole day"" on any app and get the stickiness factor for your ad.
With this approach you only need to determine if an app  is contextual enough to promote your product/app/website (or whatever). 
As an app publisher

No delayed (net 90) payment , no minimum payout
Guaranteed eCPM/CPC for a defined period....no guesswork
no one gets Any % CUT from your revenues....
You have probably seen many ad networks running thousands of impressions for measly ( couple of pennies eCPM )....well no more..!!...ban them and replace them with your contacts f 
Use the direct campaign project in conjunction with your default ad network
No need to implement our SDK (coz we don't have one)...just use custom ads functionality of your already implemented SDK
Use this service in conjunction with your default ad service.

<h1><b>Magnetic Shielding</b></h1>
<p>All of the Bungajungle Mounts are magnetically shielded. This includes the Dundabunga, Ungabunga, Neutron S and Neutron A. This means that practically no magnetic field will enter into you device. It's a technology that was developed during our previous Kickstarter projects. The magnetic field is restricted to the mounting disc. So, those worried about magnets affecting their device have nothing to worry about. These mounts will never lose their hold, and are not affected by dirt or temperature changes.</p>
<h1><b>Mounting Disc</b></h1>
<p>The disc measures a super slim depth of just .9 mm. Because it is so thin, it can be installed in-between your case and phone. The disc can also be adhered to your Apple, Android, Windows phone or cover with 3M VHB tape. The tape and disc can be easily taken off without damaging your device.</p>
<p>Features a square design with rounded corners and bead blasted texture for a premium finish to match your devices.  Put it on everything to make it mountable!</p>

<h1><b>High-quality selfies and vlogging </b></h1>
<p>We all know that the rear camera is much better than the front one. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can't take selfies or vlogs of ourselves with it—it's hard to focus on yourself when you don't see yourself. </p>
<p>Eye will mirror the display of your camera app to its screen. You will then be able to take a photo or video of yourself correctly in focus.</p>

<h1><b>3.5 mm headphone jack</b></h1>
<p>For those of us who would like to use wired headphones, Eye has your back!</p>
<p>Eye connects to the iPhone through its Lightning port and takes the sound signal through it, just like any other Lightning headphones. </p>
<p>When music plays or a call starts on the iPhone, you'll enjoy these features with your wired headphones connected to Eye. :)<br/>In case there is no sound on the iPhone, the headphone jack will play sounds from the Eye's Android OS.</p>
<p>Music playback will be in high quality because Eye has a cutting-edge DAC (digital to analog converter).</p>

<h1><b>How to back us</b></h1>
<p><b>1. Choose a reward level.</b></p>
<p>Choose one (and only one) reward level to back this project. You cannot choose 2 reward levels. You will get all the items at that level—you cannot swap things that you don't want for things that you do want (see the FAQ for why we can't do this).</p>
<b>2. If you want to add something, check out the add-on / options section.</b>
</div>
<p>If you want to add something additional to your reward, check out the add-on / options section below. You can add it to your reward by increasing your pledge by the amount specified. Take note: you can only add things to your reward that are on the menu.</p> <b>3. Relax. You've done your part. </b>All details like shipping information, color preference, and add-ons will be collected via survey in 24 hours from your contribution.<p>       </p>

High-quality selfies and vlogging 
We all know that the rear camera is much better than the front one. 
Unfortunately, we can't take selfies or vlogs of ourselves with it—it's hard to focus on yourself when you don't see yourself. 
Eye will mirror the display of your camera app to its screen. You will then be able to take a photo or video of yourself correctly in focus.
  
Eye brings the screen in front of you, just like the professional cameras with the rotating screen, for high-quality vlogs and selfies (Image courtesy of Amazon).
 
Portrait Mode on iPhone X- Best only with the rear camera (Image courtesy of Apple)

3.5 mm headphone jack
For those of us who would like to use wired headphones, Eye has your back!
Eye connects to the iPhone through its Lightning port and takes the sound signal through it, just like any other Lightning headphones. 
When music plays or a call starts on the iPhone, you'll enjoy these features with your wired headphones connected to Eye. :)In case there is no sound on the iPhone, the headphone jack will play sounds from the Eye's Android OS.
Music playback will be in high quality because Eye has a cutting-edge DAC (digital to analog converter).

Joseph is an entrepreneur. 
He made Eye because he is an ""iPhone person"" that also likes the freedom of Android. He also missed some features that are available on other smartphones but not on the iPhone.
He is the former CEO and founder of a successful Israeli website called Tan-Doo that he later sold to a bigger website.   
A geek who doesn't forget to have a good time ;-)

<p>Smart 3D has created a imitation of a human finger, or more specifically, its resistive capacity, so Pixelio works easy. For that purpose we had used patented Virtual Finger technology with unique material with 0.3% of graphene. Virtual Finger is used to activate the shutter release button in applications that do not have Bluetooth support or in mobile phones that do not support Bluetooth 4.0. With Virtual Finger you can release the shutter at the moment set on Pixelio in a completely automatic way. Thanks to that function you do not need to manually start the filming process.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Using the latest 3D technology Smart 3D Ltd has created Pixelio. Pixelio is an innovative, modern and easy to use 3D scanner that can be used by everyone!Until now, the market has lacked a good and low-cost device for 3D printer users that allows copying objects, make spare parts, or archive collections in the form of 3D files.Smart 3D Ltd team created a device that fills this gap. The company also added some simple and clever features to their small devices. That is why Pixelio – the first baby of Smart 3D - became also a device that helps to improve your photos and even movies.Pixelio will introduce you to a new dimension in 3D photography.With Pixelio scanner you can enjoy high-tech features for a reasonable price. All you need is a smartphone or GoPro camera.Everyone will find Pixelio useful!Affordable and user-friendly it should satisfy the most demanding photographers and 3D printer users. Pixelio does not have its own optics as for that purpose, it uses your smartphone camera and a free app (eg. 123D Catch). That makes Pixelio even more accessible.Featuring a wide range of functionality Pixelio will be perfect for:• sellers on eBay and other auction sites• bloggers and vloggers• graphics• real estate developers• architects, engineers etc. • or even tourists who want to take the best panoramic pictures.With Pixelio you can scan any object you like in an easy and intuitive way. 3D model can be printed directly using your 3D printer. The scan is of high quality and it captures fine detail (which is not possible with hand-held scanners). Thanks to a universal holder Pixelio can be connected to any smartphone.... simply scanned & printed:

Pixelio is a simple and fast way to create amazing 360-degree photos! This option will particularly appeal to you if you sell on the Internet, write a blog or deal with professional product photography. The process of creating pictures is automatic. 360-degree photos can be saved to MP4 or GIF format.












Fantastic panoramas taken with Pixelio scanner are characterized with precise, steady image (no movements) and high resolution (depending on what smartphone you are using the photo quality can be excellent). To meet the needs of the most demanding photographers Pixelio allows you to set intervals, speed of the arm movement and many other parameters. The device timer can be programmed for any time you like. This function will help you to create incredible time-lapse shots.
Pixelio also has a tripod mount so it can be easily attached to any tripod. Pixelio can be connected not only to a smartphone but also to a full HD GoPro-type camera so your photos and videos can become even better.
We did it in a flat - click on the link below and check this out! Go around! Isn’t that fantastic!?
Better if you watch it on your smartphone. It takes only 2 minutes to create it and the cost is pretty low 






Time-lapse movies are made by taking hundreds of photos of one scene (for example the sunset or sunrise). It looks quite effective but Pixelio gives you even more! Pixelio has a built-in feature that allows to move a camera/mobile phone (placed in the holder) centimeters by centimeters and triggering the shutter every few seconds, minutes or hours – as you set it. It gives you a possibility to create incredible panoramic time-lapse video. Pixelio allows for panning with excellent precision at the speed you set. Pixelio costs much less than other devices for panning and time-lapse movies and for its price offers so much more.

</div></div>","Totm+Travel (by Padawanlab) is the meet up of an elegant Apple Watch Dock (Totm) made of Oak from French forests AND a Really Smart Power Bank (Travl) able to perform home automation tasks.  Totm+Travl provides your Apple Watch a full week of freedom. With its built-in battery and its Dynamic Range feature, you don't need to get close to a power socket to enjoy your Watch. Take it with you anywhere... even on road trips... With Totm+Travl, don't lose your time seeking for power plugs and don't bother taking multi-charger / cable / dongle for your Watch.+No plug... No problem Charge it on the go with your Macbook Pro USB-C cable or with any USB adapter.  +Scandinavian Design: We wanted Totm+Travl to be simple, functional and minimalist. +Totm is as simple as possible yet very functional: Nightstand Mode compatible and cable integration.+Travl is sleek and ultra-easy to use. There is no power button (auto on/off) and no led light to check the battery level. Every interaction with Travl is made via the iPhone App. Not only the Bluetooth connection makes Totm+Travl really smart but it makes its design really simple. +Made for you: Because it is a naturally grown material, each product is unique and has its own beautiful characteristics and tones.Totm+Travl is worked out of a unique block of wood in our partner wood workshop in the French Jura Forest. Each Totm+Travl is then carefully sanded by hand and treated with a natural oil and wax to bring out the beautiful grain and to achieve a smooth and pleasant touch. +Quality and commitment: Designed and Manufactured in France.With the production in France we support small and medium-sized local businesses. The proximity to our manufacturers allows us to know all manufacturing steps, working conditions and involved individuals.To produce of Totm+Travl we only use PEFC-certified wood types, that are not in danger of extinction and that are grown in Europe.*Proudly Made in France The electronic part of Travl is also manufactured in France so we are 100% sure of its quality (If you already backed a Kickstarter product made in China...then you probably know why this is good news)+Perfect size & shape for NightstandWe designed Totm to hold your Watch during the night (charging time) so it allows the use of Apple Watch Nightstand mode. +Innovative design fits all strapTotm mimics the shape of your wrist and because you put your Watch on it from the top, Totm fits all kind of band. +Put your Apple Watch on Totm the way you want.You don't want to ""close"" the band before putting your Apple Watch on Totm every night??? No Problem... you don't have to. +No Cord Mess:Hide unnecessary cable inside Totm to clean up your night table. Even better, if you add Travl, there won't be any cable left.With or Without Totm
 Totm+Travl is the very First Dock for Apple Watch that is MORE than a simple stand... It's a true companion.Totm+Travl features a built-in Bluetooth 4.0 chip so it's always connected to your iPhone. It becomes a true extension providing ""Super Powers"" to your Apple Watch. Because Totm+Travl is connected to your iPhone, you always have a clear & precise view of its battery status in the iOS widget.Totm+Travl will log every Apple Watch charge Totm+Travl uses your charging habits to automatically adapt its ""remaining gauge"" every morning.With Proactive Notification, no need to check the battery level (but you can with battery widget). You’ll be notified by Totm+Travl :    + Every morning. Yoiu get the Daily Status of Totm+Travl remaining battery   + Whenever you need to charge Totm+Travl:      + Less than 1 Full Watch charge left.      + Less than 2 Average Watch charge left.Totm+Travl adds an event to your iPhone Calendar according to its next charging needs. This event is automatically adjusted every day.Even better, if the charging due date happens to be in the middle of your next trip (ex: going to Apple WWDC conference between June 5 and June 9), Totm+Travl will remind you to charge it before you leave.Look at your Apple Watch and you'll see a ""Magic switch""!
 
Totm+Travl will detect whenever your Apple Watch is connected to it and triggers actions according to your wishes (scenario).
To give you full control, Totm+Travl ""scenario"" adds conditions to the good old duo ""If / Then""

Let's take a look in detail at those 3 steps
+3 triggers (when) :



Plug: When you put your Apple Watch on Totm+Travl, and the charge begins, the magic happens.

100%: When your Apple Watch reach 100%, Totm+Travl will trigger the scenario of your choice.

Unplug: This one is the perfect ""morning trigger"". As you can imagine, it'll trigger a scenario when you remove Apple Watch from Totm+Travl.

+3 conditions (if) :

 


Days of the week: chose if you want to trigger a scenario on specific days, only week days, only weekends, etc.

Timeframe: You may limit trigger on a particular timeframe (i.e: Trigger my ""good morning"" scenario only if I unplug my Apple Watch between 6am and 9am)

Location: chose to enable or disable a trigger if you're at home (or elsewhere). You may not want your ""good night"" scenario to be triggered when your camping in the forest.

+Endless actions (then):

Connect Totm+Travl to your IFTTT account and it'll rule your house for you. With IFTTT you can connect Totm+Travl to hundreds of services/channels to control almost every IOT in the market and much much more


 
Turn Totm+Travl into HomeKit Sensors which are able to trigger any scene or control any of your HomeKit accessory (Hue Light, Blinds, Heater, Security System, etc.)

 

 

 

 
Travl is exclusively managed using iPhone (and Apple Watch) with the companion app.Like we did with Totm+Travl itself, we want to provide the best possible experience by designing a fully functional but minimalist application.

 Totm+Travl companion App will be available for iPhone & Apple Watch.

* As long as the Apple Watch is worn on a wrist (we can assume it's going to be forever), it'll fit Totm because Totm is shaped like a wrist (it's a cylinder, no?!)

During all this time, I've been taking care of the costs of the servers. Although there is a link for donations in the WordPress.org plugin’s page, only six people have made a donation over the last six years.</p><p>For the simple reason that I could not continue to pay for the servers, I was forced to close WangGuard a few days ago. But thanks to the support of a known hosting service, WangGuard can now continue with this vital community service.</p><h3>Precedents</h3><p>Since late 2004, I have been involved with WordPress. I originally specialized in WordPress Multisite and BuddyPress later on. Having many clients using both types of sites, I was forced to find an effective method to stop the sploggers. I began to develop an algorithm and a simple plugin which connected all websites of my clients. Later on, realizing the effectiveness and the necessity of reaching a critical mass of users, I started to invite acquaintances who used the same types of website settings and centralizing it on a server connected by an API. At the same time, I modified the plugin to work with normal WordPress installations. Effectiveness was started shooting up, it reached 80%, but it needed more, so I decided to change the API server and added a website with a registration process and then uploaded the plugin to WordPress.org, at that moment, WangGuard was born.</p><p>The first year WangGuard blocked 710,000 sploggers, the second year it reached 2,000,000 sploggers, the third year, it reached 15 million sploggers. Today, it has blocked more than 220 million sploggers and the effectiveness reached the 99%.</p><h3>Purpose of WangGuard</h3><p>The purpose of WangGuard is simple, remove Sploggers from anything which finish with ‘Press’. It is a service that has been protecting the WordPress websites from sploggers (spam users) for the last six years, and I hope it will keep doing it for a long time. But I'd like to improve things and add many new features. The TO-DO list of WangGuard is very long, and much remains to be done.</p><p>My dream has always been to try to keep the community protected and live only by donations (like Wikipedia), but until today, it has been impossible. In fact, those active users who have been using WangGuard for years, know that I’ve asked them a few times during the last years for how much they would pay for the service that WangGuard provides them. But I never took the decision of putting WangGuard as a premium plugin.</p><h3>Purpose of this campaign</h3><p>I’d like that WangGuard would be able to survive thanks to donations (like the Wikipedia and other open source projects models), so I’m opening this campaign now and one every year for the years to come. The amount needed corresponds to a year of work, spending some hours a day on plugin development, development of the servers API and user support.</p><p>In the last months, I’ve not been able to develop all I wanted for WangGuard, since I had to work hard in other projects to be able to pay for servers, mortgage, schools, etc. Because of this, there are two things I could not accomplish: Developing those new features I’d want for WangGuard and providing proper support to the users.</p><p>This fundraising campaign has been set up to improve WangGuard and to provide good quality support for all users.</p><p>Many people constantly ask me why I haven’t released yet any way so users can pay me for using WangGuard, and the honest truth is: I have always believed that WangGuard is a truly need and everyone deserve to use it for free. But, on the other hand, I can’t afford to keep paying all expenses for the maintenance of the best (in my opinion) anti-splog service. I need help, so there are four different ways: Donations from the WP community and active users, charging for the service, not advance anything in development or support, and finally close WangGuard.</p><p>From all of the above, the only one I'd really like is the first option, that users get involved. That implication can be by donating through this campaign or if you're a developer, you can also help me developing new features for the plugin on Github.</p><p>The goal of this campaign is to cover the expenses of a full year of my work to improve WangGuard and to keep providing support for free to all users. I’m not aiming to become a millionaire, just to be able to work and improve a service which has more than 20,000 active users per day with benefits for sites all around the world.</p><p>I’m asking for $35,000 of which I’ll have to pay the Indigogo commission, the Gateway commision and taxes.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476415450/dippqxcubosoa2rpx1c6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476548793/anulp5tifzqdl0mf9ms3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476549049/vemnyyvdenesesgthozv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>","IntroductionWangGuard has been providing anti-splog (spam users) service for the last six years.

Today, it has blocked more than 220 million sploggers and the effectiveness reached the 99%.Purpose of WangGuardThe purpose of WangGuard is simple, remove Sploggers from anything which finish with ‘Press’. It is a service that has been protecting the WordPress websites from sploggers (spam users) for the last six years, and I hope it will keep doing it for a long time. But I'd like to improve things and add many new features. The TO-DO list of WangGuard is very long, and much remains to be done.My dream has always been to try to keep the community protected and live only by donations (like Wikipedia), but until today, it has been impossible. In fact, those active users who have been using WangGuard for years, know that I’ve asked them a few times during the last years for how much they would pay for the service that WangGuard provides them. But I never took the decision of putting WangGuard as a premium plugin.Purpose of this campaignI’d like that WangGuard would be able to survive thanks to donations (like the Wikipedia and other open source projects models), so I’m opening this campaign now and one every year for the years to come. The amount needed corresponds to a year of work, spending some hours a day on plugin development, development of the servers API and user support.In the last months, I’ve not been able to develop all I wanted for WangGuard, since I had to work hard in other projects to be able to pay for servers, mortgage, schools, etc. Because of this, there are two things I could not accomplish: Developing those new features I’d want for WangGuard and providing proper support to the users.This fundraising campaign has been set up to improve WangGuard and to provide good quality support for all users.Many people constantly ask me why I haven’t released yet any way so users can pay me for using WangGuard, and the honest truth is: I have always believed that WangGuard is a truly need and everyone deserve to use it for free. But, on the other hand, I can’t afford to keep paying all expenses for the maintenance of the best (in my opinion) anti-splog service. I need help, so there are four different ways: Donations from the WP community and active users, charging for the service, not advance anything in development or support, and finally close WangGuard.From all of the above, the only one I'd really like is the first option, that users get involved. That implication can be by donating through this campaign or if you're a developer, you can also help me developing new features for the plugin on Github.The goal of this campaign is to cover the expenses of a full year of my work to improve WangGuard and to keep providing support for free to all users. I’m not aiming to become a millionaire, just to be able to work and improve a service which has more than 20,000 active users per day with benefits for sites all around the world.I’m asking for $35,000 of which I’ll have to pay the Indigogo commission, the Gateway commision and taxes.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

With the NILS, this is another example of technology being pushed further and further – it’s just what happens when real innovation meets modern technology.    Familiar to you?! The NILS 2.0 is the second generation of the popular NILS Wearable Charging Cable Bracelet. Completely redesigned, enhanced, and with added features, the NILS 2.0 is the charging cable of tomorrow, available for mobile users around the world today.   Everyone knows the feeling when you’ve got a dead device and a broken charger cable – it’s either split open at the seams, has a broken USB head, is constantly tangled together, or it was dropped in a puddle and won’t charge your device – it’s dreadful! Today, NILS 2.0 is ready to once again turn the mobile industry on its head.   NILS 2.0 features a better performance with 3.0A fast charging support – something that competing charging cable bracelets on the market simply aren’t capable of offering.     Support Charging Up To 3A Support Fast ChargingBuilt with 22/24 AWG wires (The smaller number indicates the bigger the wire = carry more current) A more rounded edge and skin-friendly designed case offers users a more comfortable charging cable that can be worn as a bracelet around your wrist.    The snap-proof tongue holds against the case so that the cable can’t snap accidentally.   Case Comparison Between NILS 2.0 & NILS 1.0 We have not only kept the most popular colors from NILS 1.0 collection but also introduced the Two-Toned Braided Leather collection to our NILS 2.0 *Not limited to the above colorsWe will continue to use the Cruelty-Free Vegan Leather and we've handpicked the even more premium leather for the braiding.   We will upgrade the surface finish to PVD coating for the casing - the same coating you found on the thousand dollars worth for watches.      Our N52 Rare Earth Magnets have undergone a modification that secures them inside of the case now.  It will not get LOST again!   What if your NILS expose to water when you wash hands or caught by rain? Simply dry it out thoroughly with soft cloth or tissue before using it. DO NOT bring in shower or pool.    We understand that SIZE MATTERS. Half inch already matters a lot. Thus we offer 4 sizes for each model, Solo & Duo, from XS to XL, from wrist size of 5 7/8"" to 8 3/4"".NILS is not only a charging cable that you can wear but also an EDC, an accessory to you.NILS is probably the most personalized wearable charging cable in the market!    Step Design - Built with Strengthened Material to lengthen the connector to fit most cases NILSYGRIP™ - An ergonomic design for a better experience in using NILS Available in Lightning, Type C(USB C) with 56k Ohm Resistor, Micro USB Support different devices NILS allows you to charge & sync your devices Carry NILS with you for your adventure!         ... and more for you to unlock*Difference between Solo & Duo is the length Solo can wrap around the wrist once  Duo can wrap around the wrist twice or even act as a necklace! Say no to PLASTIC!No more useless plastic box for the packaging.

As many of you know, I have been in great need of my own keyboard for quite some time. If you have seen me lead worship anywhere, the equipment I have used was always borrowed (of which I am extremely grateful to all those who have helped me in the past!) But I need my own gear so that I can take more steps in the direction I feel I should go!

<p>Also, as a musician and songwriter, it is important to have access to your instrument for when inspiration hits or a song is being birthed in your heart. As of right now, I have no instrument of my own to fully work on all the songs and ideas I have had. It can be quite frustrating to have a spark of inspiration and then no outlet for the spark to breathe. Therefore, the spark is snuffed out!</p><br/>
So I am asking for help in the funding of my instrument. I have researched and played many keyboards, and this is the one to which I feel the greatest connection and desire for!

<p>Here is a link to the info about it:</p><br/><a href=""http://www.kraftmusic.com/catalog/keyboards/88keykeyboards/index.asp?product=6388"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.kraftmusic.com/catalog/keyboards/88keykeyboards/index.asp?product=6388</a>
<p>I thought it more wise to go with a bundle package, seeing that I would be getting more for the money than just a keyboard.</p><br/>
(i.e. if I bought the keyboard, I would need to buy separately an amp, and the appropriate chords, etc)

<p>Remember, even the smallest amount helps! </p><br/>
Actually lets put this into perspective:<br/>
I have 739 friends on Facebook. If they all gave just $6, it would completely meet and exceed the goal amount for this fundraising project! JUST $6!! A little goes a long way!

<p><strong>Now you may be wondering, ""If the bundle price for the keyboard (before taxes) is $2,619.95, why is the goal amount $4,000?""</strong></p><br/>
Well, because I want to bless an extraordinary cause

<p>The remaining goal amount will be given to The Transformation Initiative. This is a cause and an organization very near and dear to my heart. The two women who run this organization (Joy Collins and Clara Wiggins) are amazing and are truly walking out the message and heart of Christ! Here is a little about them: </p>

</div></div>","We've all been there. You're late for a meeting or the kids are late for school and you wish to call for a polite gesture at some junction, a car behind you is tailgating or blinding with high-beam lights or you need to stop suddenly. The road so many times calls for some sort of communication between adjacent drivers and simply can't be done... because:
You can't shout while driving because... well you're in a car... and so are the other drivers.
You can't call other drivers because you don't know who they are or their contact details 

Honking only produces one sound and usually has a negative association.

 
So you usually end up looking like this...


Or like this....

 

 
 
Well.. Meet Ototok!

Wish you could get high-end specs for the price of a budget daily driver smartphone?The Elephone PX offers all the advanced specs and functionality of a high-end phone but for a fraction of the cost of flagship phones. It is the ultimate smartphone, providing the newest Android OS, next-gen tech with its pop-up camera, a true full-screen with no bezels, a massive battery and so much more. It’s time you started enjoying a powerful smartphone without paying top dollar. The PX is here to make your daily smartphone usage smart again at a smart price.  PX’s massive 6.34” LCD HD+ FULL screen is one of the largest ever made. Enjoy your videos, photos, and daily browsing on a large, visually stunning screen offering a 720 x 1480 resolution!Most current smartphones are trying to maximize their screens and screen-to-body ratios, but they are not truly full screen due to large notches and bezels housing their front-facing cameras.  However,  Elephone has built the PX without any bezels to be a true screen experience at an affordable price - making it unique among current smartphones.You’ve never seen a front-camera like this. Sliding into the top of the phone, the PX camera doesn’t take any screen space and pops in and out of the phone. The mechanical motor powering the camera is highly durable, and is tested and rated for 300,000 uses or 5 years of daily use! Using 16-megapixel dual rear cameras the PX simulates human binocular vision, giving you the ability to capture three-dimensional images and videos in stunning clarity. And the advanced brightness and noise controls ensure beautiful images are always taken.Further, it allows for additional aperture as it provides an extra opening for light to enter and hit sensor making your PX perform better in low light while ensuring images will be sharp and loss in details will be minimum. Here is our Elephone PX review. The Elephone team is dedicated to providing support and accessibility for the PX across the globe. The PX will be fully unlocked and will have support across more than 100 countries across Europe, Asia and North America and over 1000 carriers.Before the campaign is concluded and shipping begins, we will reach out to each backer with a survey to ensure that the PX will work in your home country and for your carrier. If your local carrier does not support the PX then we will refund your money.The Elephone PX will ship as separate versions supporting different bands - 1 for the EU/Asia and the other for Americas.

It further provides additional security by removing the need for a password or pin to give you more convenience. Along with the fingerprint scanner, the PX has a built-in heart rate sensor. The heart rate sensor measures your heart rate in Beats per Minute using an optical LED light source and an LED light sensor. The light shines through your skin allowing the sensor to measure the amount of light reflecting back. The light reflections vary as blood pulses under your skin past the light, and these variations are translated into Beats per Minute.When the PX is synced with a compatible app, it can provide you with accurate information regarding heart rate and calories burned. The more you use the PX, the more you'll notice the delicate thought and effort put into the design to set it apart from other smartphones.

Let's make it happen!</p></div>","Not sure if people you care about use their phones while driving?  They do.  A recent study reported by Wired Magazine revealed that virtually everyone uses their phone behind the wheel.  Is it any surprise that 60% of teen accidents are due to using a phone while driving?  It shouldn’t be.If the people you care about are going to use a phone while driving, then let’s at least make it safe to do so.  Our product, SafeConnect is the safest possible product for controlling your phone while driving since it has no view screen.  A recent study by AAA revealed that using a view screen in the car is even more dangerous than using your phone.  SafeConnect provides a way for drivers to use apps & features of their phones while keeping their eyes totally focused on the road, hands on the wheel, and phones in their pockets.  Our Deluxe model does the same thing, but also provides auditory & tactile stimulation to keep drivers from zoning out at the wheel (a.k.a. falling prey to “highway hypnosis”).  This is especially important during a solo drive or a long drive.Since any driver can cause you to be in a wreck, both of our products are offered at an affordable price: the roads really aren’t safe unless everyone can afford a safe connectivity option in their car.  Nothing is more important than saving lives. Imagine Freedom to Connect while Driving (FB, texts, phone calls)Dictate Facebook messages for friends and post on their walls.  Hear FB messages, how many likes you’re getting, or posts from your Facebook feed dictated to you.Yes, even without a screen, SafeConnect works with Facebook.  SafeConnect also lets you make & receive phone calls, hear your text messages, and dictate and send your own text messages.  With so many ways to stay connected, you can feel like you’re with your friends even when you’re driving alone. Never feel lost againFind the best restaurant according to Yelp or the cheapest gas station nearby and then hear turn-by-turn directions that avoid traffic.  Get sports scores, weather, and use other Google Now features.  Any app on the user’s phone is potentially compatible (and we are constantly working to make more apps compatible). Putting It All Together: Affordable SafetyMost of the drivers who cause phone-related accidents couldn't afford to pay $400 to have safer connectivity in their car (going rate for connectivity options).  Our solution ($169, but as little as $69 on Indiegogo) is much less expensive than the competitors, safer than the competitors (since we keep total visual focus on the road & hands on the wheel), and more versatile than the competitors (since we seek to work with every app already on your Android phone).Here's how it works:
Both SafeConnect and the Deluxe model clamp onto any steering wheel in seconds
The connection happens automatically when SafeConnect is turned on, the app is running on your phone, & your phone is within range of SafeConnect
Over Bluetooth, the driver can control apps & features on his Android phone by pushing buttons on SafeConnect & dictating requests
 What we have so farWe have working prototypes and four apps are working with the product.  Note that photographs are pictures of the prototypes, and the final design will be more streamlined.Apps working so far:Apps in development (in priority order):Let us know which apps are important to you. We listen to our customers! Deluxe DrumsThe Deluxe model puts 8 drum kit sounds on your steering wheel.  Benefits:
Stay alert on long solo drives; Fights Zoning Out at the wheel (Highway Hypnosis) by providing auditory & tactile stimulation
Deluxe has all SafeConnect Features
Deluxe has 8 additional sensors for playing drum sounds from a standard drum kit
Makes your car music interactive
Hear your drum rendition with your music on your car speakers
Allows for jamming with your favorite musicians
Unlocks additional functionality for apps such as ""Smack Trivia"" and ""Smack Languages""

I could do that, and show some fancy diagrams and pictures of the prototype and ask for money. But let's slow down.</p><p>My professional experience includes development of products – from concept, over development, to product launch and marketing. And also, I am aware how important it is to understand the voice of customers and iterate design specifications early. It would be great to really understand your needs:</p><ul>
<li>Do you indeed require the TX functionality?</li>
<li>Do you need an internal battery for longer operational time?</li>
<li>Do you want a pre-amplifier? Or an input filter bank?</li>
<li>What is your intended application? HAM? Fun? Research?</li>
<li>Do you prefer a finalized Moto Mod or would be a MDK module satisfactory?</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul><p>Everything is possible, but it will also influence the final price. Furthermore, a possible cooperation with Motorola could lower the price even more (i.e. re-use of the existing casing). Sounds good, doesn't it?</p><p>Hence, within this campaign, I am asking for donations for further development of the prototype. The funds will be used solely to cover some costs of the development.

It was only a dream, the advance in technology didn’t exist until recently to do all signal decoding in software. Until now! As soon as I discovered Moto Mod concept and Transform the Smartphone Challenge, I knew immediately, that it's finally the right time to make my child dream real: To create the SDR Moto Mod that can receive and analyze unknown radio communication and interact with various radio communication systems.Other SmartphonesThe intended SDR Moto Mod is developed especially for Motorola Z phones, however a version for other smartphones is planned as well. If you like the idea, please continue reading and support this campaign!How it worksDifferent applications of the Software Definer Radio (SDR) Moto Mod are possible:Interact with Radio SystemsSDR Mod includes universal narrow-band transceiver for digital communication. You can select frequency, modulation and other parameters in order interact with radio systems (both send and receive!). It is planned to support and certify the device for different protocols and bands, such you can use the SDR Mod as a remote controller, IoT gateway, or without any limitation in the “open HAM mode”.Global Digital Communication without InternetYou can text or exchange data with an another smartphone that is equipped with a SDR Moto Mod. You can even use the SDR Mod for satellite reception! We are currently researching the possibility to support some global networks like Outernet.As an Universal remote ControllerYou can use the SDR Moto Mod to control your home appliance!For this specific use-case, a separate campaign has been lunched (as the target audience differs significantly ;-)IoT without InternetYou can use the SDR Moto Mod to connect directly with your local ""Internet of Things"" network and analyze data within.  Without internet access, without WLAN gateways!Analyze Unknown SignalsUsing the embedded wide-band SDR receiver, you can monitor the whole radio spectrum, analyze unknown signals and listen to various services. The system is compatible with the RTL SDR based receivers, so 3rd party software can be used:Just have funSDR Mod can also receive FM, AM, DVB-T or other public services!Currently, not every service is supported by an App on the Android system. But if you want to receive a new type of radio communication, you need just new software, not hardware!Features and BenefitsThe SDR Moto Mod consists of an wide-band SDR receiver, that is compatible with RTL SDR dongles for great compatibility with 3rd party apps, and an universal narrow-band digital communication transceiver that acts as a standard serial interface to the android system.Further features:
Wide-band RX Range (SDR): Approx. 50-1500 GHz (to be clarified)
Narrow-band TX/RX Range: 27-1050 MHz
Integrated battery
Internal & External antenna
Firmware control of the accessible radio frequency bands in order to fulfill regulatory and legal requirements
Existing Android Apps and SDR community
What We Need & What You GetDo you want to own such a device as well? Off-the-shelf? Then, carry on reading!Now, one should promise a final product in a year, right? I could do that, and show some fancy diagrams and pictures of the prototype and ask for money. But let's slow down.My professional experience includes development of products – from concept, over development, to product launch and marketing. And also, I am aware how important it is to understand the voice of customers and iterate design specifications early. It would be great to really understand your needs:
Do you indeed require the TX functionality?
Do you need an internal battery for longer operational time?
Do you want a pre-amplifier? Or an input filter bank?
What is your intended application? HAM? Fun? Research?
Do you prefer a finalized Moto Mod or would be a MDK module satisfactory?
…
Everything is possible, but it will also influence the final price. Furthermore, a possible cooperation with Motorola could lower the price even more (i.e. re-use of the existing casing). Sounds good, doesn't it?Hence, within this campaign, I am asking for donations for further development of the prototype. The funds will be used solely to cover some costs of the development. But what is even more important: your contribution will prove me and Motorola that there is a real demand for this product!The prototype design will be released as open-source (with some limitation due to eventual NDAs).If global demand for this product will be shown, the end-price will be announced. At that point, a new campaign extension will be launched, with final products as its perks. Hopefully we get also Motorola as a partner, as this campaign participates in the Transform the Smartphone Challenge.PrototypeCurrently, the concept of the wide-band receiver was tested (using R820T2 + RTL2832U over internal USB) with the SDRTouch Android App, as shown in the video below. The narrow-band transceiver concept is currently under development.

<br/><h1>Designing MagMount</h1>
<div>We have been working on this project for 9 months and have come along way.  Our goal was to design a better docking solution to what was currently in the marketplace.  Our design intentions were to make MagMount simple, sturdy, and fun to use.   Of course quality materials and production processes are a given for all of Doc Artisan products. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Our first initiative was to design the magnetic head.  It had to be able to hold an iPad and so we incorporated 6 super strong magnets mounted on a thick metal plate. This would provide the stability and magnetic power we needed.</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442855982/hrs3gcxfhogsaoop4waf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Next we focused on the neck and ball joint.  We opted to go with a 6 inch neck and fully rotatable head joint.  The long neck provides enough height/reach to suspend an iPad off any surface.  The ball joint allows you to adjust the head in any position and then tighten it to lock into your desired position.</span></p>

Where we are & why we need youAfter more than a year working our tails off we are almost at the point of having fully functional prototypes. We've harnessed the best of technology and design to provide amazing features to solve all the problems of the modern cell phone user.As seen in:Possible dendrite related failure:
What's Next?
We already have trusted manufacturing partners with vast experience in electronics ready to help us get Maxergy Solar Adaptors to market.* December - Spread the word and fund our dream.* January - Finalize and build the functional prototypes, set up the tooling and start software development* February - Tooling build out,complete assembly testing and international control certifications. Part qualification and pre-production builds, pilot production, quality assurance and product validation.* March - Begin manufacturing for the injection molded and thermo-molded parts, software testing.* April - Finalize the assembly process and begin order fulfillment.* May - Delivery???

RISKS AND ChallengesWe have been working  for more than a year developing Maxergy Solar Adaptors and getting it ready for production. We know what the next steps are for manufacturing and fulfillment and have great partners ready to start. However, we know that before mass production begins, we may encounter some problems. We have plans to mitigate all the risks and have enlisted great advisers that will also help.Manufacturing:We need to create the tooling to manufacture different parts of the product. This process is complex and requires time and money. Complications could potentially emerge and delay the manufacturing schedule. To tackle this risk we've selected partners that can work closely with us through the whole process.Software:The software is functional but we still have work to do building all the features that we want to include. Software development sometimes gets tricky and takes longer than expected, but we have a lot of experience in this area and if necessary will look for additional help to solve any problems that could emerge.We will undoubtedly have surprises on our journey, but we trust that we have the team to overcome all challenges, as we've done so far. Our goal is to make the best possible product for you and deliver it right on time.",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The 12.9-inch iPad Pro supports USB Power Delivery as the new 12-inch MacBook. Thus, it can be charged with a 29W charger (14.5V2A). Similarly, the iPhone 6 and later models also support quick charging at 11W (5V2.1A). However, the default chargers are only 5V/2,4A (iPad Pro) and 5v/1A (iPhones) respectively.</p>

</div></div>","ATTENTIONS: MARBLE DCS1 AND DCS2 only support the New MacBook Pro 13 inch version but NOT 15 inch. Please be aware of this before contributing.


 

 

  

More and more laptops are featuring the new, powerful USB Type-C port. All of your computer's power, data transfer, and output will be wired through a single USB-C port. It truly embodies technological simplicity.

But what about your stuff? And when you need to multitask, how do you fit everything into a single port? Well, that’s where Marble comes into play: the ultra-portable 2-in-1 docking and charging station that is designed to work with USB-C devices such as Apple’s new 12-inch Macbook, Dell XPS 13 (9350), Samsung TabPro S, Huawei Matebook and other emerging models.

*Marble’s port expansion function should work with all devices that feature a USB3.1-C port. However, the charging function may not work with certain USB3.1-C featured devices if the charging voltage of the device does not fall into one of the five following voltages: 5V/9V/12V/14.5V/19V Marble supports or the manufacturer intentionally disabled the charging function by third-party chargers like HP Spectre X2.

Marble offers a single compact way to connect multiple devices to your USB-C ported laptop, including the new Macbook, Dell XPS13-9350, Samsung TabPro S, Huawei Matebook and other emerging devices.  
A Versatile Docking Station
With 2 USB 3.0 high-speed ports, 2 USB-C ports, an MSD 4.0 microSD card reader and monitor extension ports like HDMI and Mini Displayport, Marble gives you all the functionality of having your devices nearby. It’s as though they are still plugged right into your computer.  
Extend Your Laptop Screen By Up to 2 Monitors
 
MSD 4.0 Super-Fast MicroSD Reader
 

With a built-in 60W AC adapter, it's time to say goodbye to all those chargers and adapters for your smartphone, tablet and other devices. That’s because Marble does all the jobs simultaneously! Think of Marble as your super-charger – it’s the perfect system made to charge your USB-C ported laptop while also powering your other devices.  

 

 

When it’s NOT connected to an AC outlet, you can still use Marble as an on-the-go multifunctional hub for your laptop. The power supply of the USB ports will automatically switch from AC to laptop with a total maximum power output of 5V1.5A (following USB bc1.2 specifications).
A Portable Multi-Functional Hub
 

The beauty of Marble is that you can even use it as your super-charger and travel companion without connecting it to your laptop. Marble works as a regular, yet much more powerful charger for your daily life.  
Use Marble Just Like a Versatile Charger
 

The 12.9-inch iPad Pro supports USB Power Delivery as the new 12-inch MacBook. Thus, it can be charged with a 29W charger (14.5V2A). Similarly, the iPhone 6 and later models also support quick charging at 11W (5V2.1A). However, the default chargers are only 5V/2,4A (iPad Pro) and 5v/1A (iPhones) respectively.

Now with Marble, you can fully unleash the fast charging speed of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and iPhone 6 (and later models) (up to 29W for iPad Pro and up to 10.5W for multiple iPhones simultaneously). That’s twice as fast as charging with Apple’s default charger!

*In order to quickly charge the 12.9-inch iPad Pro using Marble, a USB-C to lightning cable is needed. It can be purchased directly from Apple: http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0X2AM/A/usb-c-to-lightning-cable-1-m
Marble offers a single compact way to connect multiple devices to your USB-C featured laptop. Marble DCS1 has 2 USB 3.0 Type A ports, 2 USB-C ports, an HDMI Type A port, an MSD 4.0 microSD reader, and a 60W AC inlet to power it all. In addition, DCS2 is equipped with a Micro HDMI and a Mini Displayport to switch out the HDMI Type A port. It’s the only system designed to charge your laptop while powering all of your devices. 

 

 

One of the greatest technical difficulties we faced during the development of Marble was how to ensure substantial output capacity in such a small form factor with the presence of so many additional ports. We are very proud that we successfully integrated a built-in 60W AC adapter into such a small form factor, which is crucial for any effective multi-device power supply that works with your laptop.

 

3 Ports（1 USB3.0-C + 2 USB 3.0-A） Featured with MoSmart™ Charging Technology 

MoSmart™ Charging Technology can detect all the devices that are plugged in and automatically adjust the charging current to the optimal one. From trivial current charging devices like Fitbit to Bluetooth earphones, and from regular current charging devices like smartphones to power-hungry devices like the iPad, Marble takes care of them all and delivers the optimal current automatically.
1 USB3.1-C Port Featured with MoSmart™ Turbocharging Technology

 
On Marble, the USB3.1-C port not only adjusts the current like MoSmart™ ports, but it also supports USB PD2.0 and adjusts the voltage automatically among 5V/9V/12V/14.5V/19V.

Powerful as proven, Marble has a similar size to the Apple 60W charger, but it is equipped with so many extra features that a regular Macbook charger could never provide. Marble is your ultimate super-charger and your best travel companion.

 
Marble Is Similar in Size to the 13.3-inch Macbook Pro Power Adapter (60W)
 

 

Safety has always been our priority, which is why we built Marble with advanced protection technology. Marble protects all your plugged-in devices from overcurrent, overvoltage, overtemperature and short-circuiting, giving you a stable power supply and peace of mind

 

Marble is made internationally compatible with a working voltage of 100-240V. We will include 1 AC power cord that is compatible with your local socket based on the backer's choice or their shipping destinations. (Backers can specify their AC power cord type in the final survey.)

 

Imagine the hundreds of dollar you would need to spend on all the cables and adapters for your many devices. Now Marble does everything for you, and you can have it all at an affordable price. And let’s not forget the ease of use Marble provides!
Incredible Value of Marble
 

  As for YoCam, our previous Kickstarter campaign, we just charged shipping and handling costs without taking care of backer’s import tax and VAT like most other Kickstarter campaigns. It turned out that many of our backers, especially our European backers, were burned by insanely high duty/VAT costs, especially since the courier often charges additional handling and processing fees.
 
Now, we would like to proudly introduce Marble as the first worldwide shipping-friendly campaign. All you have to do is pay a one-time flat shipping fee, and we will take care of all the tax and import duty-related issues. (We know how much of a headache it can be.) Below is a breakdown chart of how we determine the shipping rate for different countries and regions.

 
In brief: With the flat fee we charged, we will take care of all additional shipping costs, including shipping, handling, duty and VAT. We guarantee your peace of mind!

<p><b>It is that easy to find a USB port</b>?</p>
<p>Yes! Nowadays, USB ports become standard
features in many devices in many laptop, desktop, printer, monitor,
speaker, wall socket, TV, Xbox, PlayStation, airplane, office, hotel, power
bank, car, boat. Keep your eyes open, and you will find them.</p>

<p><b>How to claim a perk?</b></p>

If
this is your first time using Indiegogo, you could read Indiegogo’s article <b><a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526766-How-to-Claim-a-Perk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here</a>.</b><br/>

<div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What is OTG (On-The-Go)?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>USB OTG (On-The-Go) allows your mobile
device to become a host to directly communicate with USB peripherals such as
flash drives. It often uses a Micro-USB connector to link the host devices.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The difference between OTG, Bluetooth,NFC,
and others.</b></p>
<p>Using Bluetooth to transfer a large file is
painfully slow, and usually requires pairing. Most desktop PCs don’t equip
Bluetooth.</p>
<p>NFC (Near Field Communication) is
relatively new on smartphones and tablets. NFC is faster than Bluetooth. However,
NFC requires two devices to remain close together during file transferring. However,
most of laptop and desktop PCs don’t equip NFC.</p>
<p>OTG is also very fast. Today, major
smartphones, tablets (not iPhone, or iPad) in the market support OTG. OTG is a
“Plug &amp; Use” feature for most of the supported devices. You can enable
SYMLIS Sparrow’s OTG functionality on the Micro-USB connector to communicate
with your mobile devices and use its USB Type A connector to communicate with
your PCs. </p>
<p>Some other types of file sharing methods
such as Cloud storage and Wi-Fi Direct, need additional Internet or wireless
connections. The transferring rates vary depending on conditions.</p>

<p>Manufacturing is tricky. Even though we are
working hard to keep things on schedule, there may be some unforeseen variables
such as delays on material supplies. Manufacturing high quality products
requires time and effort. We understand that you are eager to receive your
products, but it is better to delay for high quality than lose quality control just to rush production. As you may know already, many crowdfunding projects suffer
delays and other complications because they leave themselves too little margin
for unexpected issues. Instead of providing you an unrealistic delivery
schedule, we leave margins in our schedule for handling these unforeseen
obstacles during manufacturing, and we work diligently to minimize the impact
on delivery schedule caused by any potential issues in the future.</p>

Q&A

It is that easy to find a USB port?
Yes! Nowadays, USB ports become standard
features in many devices in many laptop, desktop, printer, monitor,
speaker, wall socket, TV, Xbox, PlayStation, airplane, office, hotel, power
bank, car, boat. Keep your eyes open, and you will find them.

How to claim a perk?

If
this is your first time using Indiegogo, you could read Indiegogo’s article Here.



What is OTG (On-The-Go)?

USB OTG (On-The-Go) allows your mobile
device to become a host to directly communicate with USB peripherals such as
flash drives. It often uses a Micro-USB connector to link the host devices.


The difference between OTG, Bluetooth,NFC,
and others.
Using Bluetooth to transfer a large file is
painfully slow, and usually requires pairing. Most desktop PCs don’t equip
Bluetooth.
NFC (Near Field Communication) is
relatively new on smartphones and tablets. NFC is faster than Bluetooth. However,
NFC requires two devices to remain close together during file transferring. However,
most of laptop and desktop PCs don’t equip NFC.
OTG is also very fast. Today, major
smartphones, tablets (not iPhone, or iPad) in the market support OTG. OTG is a
“Plug & Use” feature for most of the supported devices. You can enable
SYMLIS Sparrow’s OTG functionality on the Micro-USB connector to communicate
with your mobile devices and use its USB Type A connector to communicate with
your PCs. 
Some other types of file sharing methods
such as Cloud storage and Wi-Fi Direct, need additional Internet or wireless
connections. The transferring rates vary depending on conditions.

<h2>Social Lock Developers Kit</h2>
<p>The Social Lock Developers Kit contains an assembled PCB combining a Bluetooth Low Energy SoC capable of driving a set of locking components. The device locks and unlocks using a secure API. It's made for developers who think their smartphone is a key. Just like we do. With the Social Lock Developers Kit you can add a smart lock that is operated with a smartphone to any system.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How did this get started?</h3>
<p>In the past months we build the demonstrator of our Social Bike Lock. During this work we discovered a simple need: a well programmed PCB and bluetooth low energy component you can integrate in any design; with a basic Android app to get you started with your lock in hours instead of days.</p>
<p><em>The very first Social Lock Demonstrator </em></p>

<p> </p>
<p>There are a bunch of solutions on the rise that help you secure your houses, cars, bikes and boats with your smartphone operating as a key. <b>T</b><strong>he Social Lock Developers Kit is an easy first step for anyone who is exploring the possibilities of smart locks.</strong> </p>

<h3>We are in development..</h3>
<p>We successfully made a first prototype of the Social Lock Developers Kit. We need a funding of €20.000 to take the step from one prototype to a reliable and complete Social Lock Developers Kit. A successful campaign will allow us to create at least 100 kits at affordable costs with a local factory in The Netherlands, develop a view missing pieces of software and ask an expert to take a last look at the security issues. </p>
<p>By supporting our campaign and helping us reach our goal we get the opportunity to create a thriving community of developers working on an world wide open source framework</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Meet the team </strong></h3>
<p>We are Peter Tettelaar, Daniël Steginga, Gerrit Jan van 't Veen and Gregor van Egdom and a bunch of other Dutch engineers with backgrounds varying from Web and UX Design, Electronics and Industrial Design. We cooperate in several projects with different companies in the lead. This one is started by Dutch Coast. Our team has a decade of experience in failure and success with projects like this. Fortunately the latter is most common to us.</p>
<p>This is actualy the first time we use a crowdfunding platform to start a project like this. Althought many tried this before us, we are still pretty excited about it! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
<p><strong>What does the Kit solve? </strong></p>
<p>The kit allows you to create a (portable) lock which can be opened with your smartphone. Send virtual keys, with the Social Lock platform, to your guest users to gain access to your lock.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I need the API?</strong></p>
<p>To send virtual keys or manage your device, you will need the API. </p>
<p><strong>Nevermind the Kit, can I get my hands on the Social Bike Lock?</strong></p>
<p>Sure you can, but we will start an alternative campaign for the Social Bike Lock. If you are interested in becoming a Social Bike Lock partner, contact us at hello@dutch-coast.com.</p>

<p>Our campaign has now ended and – thanks to you – we reached our goal with some room to spare. In fact, we are proud to announce that bttn is the 2nd most funded technology project ever from Finland!</p>
<p>We will now go deep into the dungeons and start whipping the elves (just kidding, we wouldn't whip anyone) so that we can ship all your goodies very soon.</p>
<p>T-shirts will be shipped sometime next week and they should reach you around the end of October.</p>
<p>The bttns will be shipped in early November and they should reach you sometime later in the month.</p>
<p>We will also tally all the referrals next week and will start issuing your rewards then.</p>
<p>And if you missed the campaign but still would like to order a bttn or two, do drop us a line. </p>

<p>We've set an initial goal of $50,000 for the campaign. With this funding we can proceed quickly with our manufacturing and get some quality products out very soon. Should we fall short of the goal, we will still proceed with manufacturing but the schedule is likely to stretch and we most likely have to start with smaller volumes, which increases manufacturing price and the eventual consumer price. </p>

</div></div>","Thank you!
Our campaign has now ended and – thanks to you – we reached our goal with some room to spare. In fact, we are proud to announce that bttn is the 2nd most funded technology project ever from Finland!
We will now go deep into the dungeons and start whipping the elves (just kidding, we wouldn't whip anyone) so that we can ship all your goodies very soon.
T-shirts will be shipped sometime next week and they should reach you around the end of October.
The bttns will be shipped in early November and they should reach you sometime later in the month.
We will also tally all the referrals next week and will start issuing your rewards then.
And if you missed the campaign but still would like to order a bttn or two, do drop us a line. 
What Is the bttn?The bttn is just what it sounds like – a simple Internet connected (either via WiFi or 3G) physical push button that can be used for almost anything using the power of the Internet. Here are some examples:You can set the bttn to execute e.g. the following predefined tasks:

Send messages: email or text messages


Send social media messages: Tweets or Facebook status updates


Submit any http get or post request, i.e. control a web page


Control smart home devices: OpenHome and SmartThings compliant


Trigger IFTTT recipes or Zapier zaps


Publish a RSS feed


Update counters on the web

Everything else through our REST API
And much more (no kitchen sink, though)...
Why Did We Create the bttn?Consider the Internet-of-Things (or Internet-of-Everything as some like to call it): everything – yes, literally everything – will be connected. Lightbulbs will talk to houses will talk to entertainment systems will talk to ... something else.This massive interconnectedness will fundamentally change how we interact with our environments. We will have unprecedented control over how the things we live with behave and respond to our needs.Cars will be safer. TV will be better. Homes will be smarter.There's a catch, though. Your alarm clock may talk to your heater may talk to your coffee machine but something is missing: you.                                              Even Fido, the official bttn dog, can use itThe bttn is all about simplicity: making the Internet-of-Things simple, accessible, and – dare we even say it – human again. It is no longer just computer chips talking to computer chips in ones and zeros.With the bttn, you take charge using the simplest user interface in the world: a modest push-button.Featured inNaturally, we think the bttn is the greatest thing since sliced bread. But you don't have to just take our word for it:What Is It For?That's the beauty of the bttn: only your imagination is the limit. You can create very simple or very complicated actions using our back end but using the bttn will always be super simple.Families can use the bttn for communications, safety, and many, many other uses:The bttn can be used for home and office automation to bring a shortcut to our everyday lives:The bttn is great for service businesses for streamlining their operations and improving communications:For example at a medical office, the assistant or nurse can hit the bttn to let the doctor know next patient is ready.Retailers and other businesses can easily build customer surveys using the bttn at a very low cost:One bttn press at the office and BAM! Your favorite lunch has been ordered for delivery. Press twice for a hungry friend:

In fact, the more we have spoken with potential users, the more uses we have discovered. We bet you have some ideas that we haven't even considered yet. Even more use case examples in the media gallery! 
This is Fido's favoriteWe'd love to feature your use case in our gallery!How Does it Work?The process of setting up and using the bttn is very simple. The initial setup procedure consists of four simple steps:

If you want to use 3G data, insert a GSM microSIM card with a mobile data plan. Voice and text features of a data plan are not needed. Note: W-CDMA version (available in 2015) required in Japan for 3G.


Give it power: Put in four AA batteries, or plug in a 5V MicroUSB power adapter (chances are you already have one a compatible cell phone charger lying around in your home). We did not include a charger, as the world is full of wall outlet power sockets of different shapes.


If you don't want to use 3G data (i.e. no microSIM card is inserted), then Wi-Fi is used. Open your laptop, log in to Wi-Fi access point ""bttn"", and enter your Wi-Fi network's SSID and password.


A small green led will light up when the bttn is connected.

Now you can start creating your bttn magic.

Using any browser, go to the URL my.bt.tn, and create an account using the code provided with your bttn.


Press the ""Settings"" button to give your bttn name and location.


Press the ""Configure"" button to give your bttn an action.

Now you can either choose one of the many ready-made actions or create your own. You can select from predefined actions or create your ownCustomizing a pre-made action requires just filling in a some basic information such as a phone number or an email address and the message you want to send.It does not get much simpler than thisAnd you're done. Everything is web-based and you can control, monitor, or configure your bttn from any web browser no matter where you are.If you are technically minded...When a user presses a bttn, it contacts our servers and performs a predefined tasks – like texting someone, sending an email, running a program, turning a device on or off, and so on. The predefined tasks can be chosen from a ready-made list (with super-easy customization) or you can create your own if you are feeling ambitious. We've spent a lot of time to make sure that the system is easy enough to use for just about anyone yet it has enough power to satisfy hardcore geeks. We integrate with a whole lot of channels and servicesThe bttn communicates with bt.tn servers, which then trigger the pre-set action. The actions can be counter updates, web page updates, twitter tweets, RSS feeds, IFTTT triggers, email, SMS messaging, or any combination thereof.Bttn’s multiple patent-pending system
offers a wide variety of ready-made drag-and-drop actions as well as wizards
for simply and quickly defining new actions.You can easily control several bttnsUsing the bttn to trigger an IFTTT recipe is just a matter of a few clicksBeautiful by Design 

We gave an internationally known industrial
designer the task of making the bttn beautiful, functional, and robust. Harri
Koskinen's earlier work includes the iconic Block lamp and we think we may have
another icon on our hands.
Designed in Finland by Harri KoskinenThe bttn works in connection with e.g. IFTTT, and Zapier, making the thousands of great integrations and already created accessible with a simple push of a button. Whenever these (and other) services evolve, we evolve.What Is in It?
Please note that battery life depends on usage conditions and patterns

OpenHome and bttn
We are particularly excited about the possibilities of the bttn in the Smart Home. So, we have joined OpenHome Labs, a program launched by connected home leader Icontrol Networks. When funded, bttn will work seamlessly with all devices and services bearing the OpenHome logo.The bttn plays nice with OpenHome and your smart home
What Difference Does My Contribution Make? By contributing, you help us get to the market faster, smoother, and safer. You ensure you and others get the bttn sooner.
Contributing also gives a clear signal to us that we are doing something that matters to you – this sort of validation is extremely important to us.
We've set an initial goal of $50,000 for the campaign. With this funding we can proceed quickly with our manufacturing and get some quality products out very soon. Should we fall short of the goal, we will still proceed with manufacturing but the schedule is likely to stretch and we most likely have to start with smaller volumes, which increases manufacturing price and the eventual consumer price. 

And What Do Our Backers Get?
We have created a wide variety of perks ranging from our undying gratitude (which you can earn with surprisingly little money) to a company-wide battery of bttns to your very own custom Configuration Wizard on our server.
See the right side bar for a detailed list of the perks we offer. If you have an idea for an even better perk, let us know. We just might use your idea!

You can select your bttn in one of the four colors. Or, maybe, get the whole series.And, of course, there is a super-duper cool t-shirt available. We think it looks pretty fab. We hope you agree...

Press the bttn and Magic Happens™

Your Reward for Referring Friends
There are social media buttons at the top of this page. When you click on them, they send a tweet or a Facebook post or a Google+ message with a special URL that leads to this campaign. What is special about that URL is that if your friend makes a contribution, you will be credited with an assist (right, technically it is a referral).
We keep track of the referrals and we will reward you with a $10 credit towards your contributions for each referral. Because of Indiegogo rules, we cannot give you cash but if you make 3 referrals, you can get a t-shirt for free. If you make 10 referrals, you get a free bttn. And so on.
The only real catch is that you need to be either logged into Indiegogo OR you need to send the message in connection with your own contribution (the tools will be available on the contribution page) in order for the system to track the referral.
When you are sending your referral message, you can save the URL and reuse it. You do not have to be logged in when reusing the URL; it is enough that you are logged in when you create it.

The bttn story

We are based in Helsinki, Finland, which is one of the hotbeds of European tech startups.



We've
often been asked how we came up with the idea for the bttn. As many of the
greatest inventions or services (no, we are not on that level yet but we are
working on it) the bttn grew out of a series of case discoveries.
Two years ago our Founder Harri was sitting with some of his friends at a restaurant terrace in Helsinki, Finland. They wondered why - in the otherwise ready-made world - there were no action buttons at the tables, which could be used to signal waitresses. At the same time, one of them shared his worry about how he could help his 75 year old mother, living alone in her house, to make it day-to-day.
Thus began the bttn journey. Harri is a serial entrepreneur and making new things is in his blood. He started talking to some of his trusted friends, potential recruits and some potential early backers. Things came together quickly – everybody loved the idea – and the company was started in the Autumn of 2013.
First prototypes came out in early 2014 and now we are preparing for our first mass production run.



Risks & Challenges  Developing new stuff is always a little risky. We think our risks are manageable as we have undergone several hardware revisions already, we have a seasoned team, the prototypes works well, and we have a very tightly focused goal. However, the risks include: 
Quality issues in production Potential component shortages
Key team members being run over by the number 7B tram 
We are keeping a very tight track on our production in order to mitigate any risks. Furthermore, our team never crosses the road in one group in order to avoid catastrophic tram-related accidents.

a star in the sky, our logo guides our vision. It connects the sun and the Polar
star as PKparis connects your world with its products. These two sources of

Notre projet : faciliter l’accès à votre monde
digital. Ou le produit est très bon ou nous ne le produirons pas (même si nous
avons perdu de l’argent). Nous avons déjà annulé 2 projets car trop décevants.
 Nos produits : voici 2 produits que nous avons lancés mi octobre 2013,
et plus de produits excitants sont à venir bientôt. Nous pensons alors que
vous serrez d’accord que nous sommes différents et que nous ferons la différence … ensemble, avec votre aide.

                      PK K'2 : la plus petite clef USB au monde pour Android----------------------------------------

Short Summary
"" WE WANT OUR CUSTOMER TO BE PROUD OF OUR PRODUCTS ""
- the world smallest USB3 key, 64GB to plug and stay on your laptop
- the world smallest USB key for Android (tablet/phone)
- a clever Keyring, to avoid to look for or lose your USB key
- a carabiner USB key, to attach it whereever you want
- USB Keys for tablet/smartphone to exchange in both way
- more innovative Keys to help life at home or in travel

PKparis,
Premium Keys of Paris, to connect your world, is a French company established
in 2013, by a team with 20 years experience in hi-tech industries, to create a
unique range of simple yet small innovative, designed and user-friendly storage
products for computers, mobiles/tablets,TVs and cars, under the brand PK.
Considering
that the term “small is beautiful” will always drives the new technologies,
PKparis decided to focus on the design of the smallest but vital hi-tech
product: a key, a device gathering intelligence and connection small enough to
sit in your hand.
With
PKparis’s innovative keys, to store, use, share and exchange your data will
always be a pleasure. Our small USB keys, WIFI keys, HDMI keys and our future
releases will facilitate your daily digital life. 
Our compagny’s
tagline ,""Inspired"", informs our range of products, the result of
harmonising an idea to a design. Our logo
drives the identity of the brand, combining simplicity, a metaphore and
the  orange color to reinforce an
aspect of the key, be it its quality or its use. The metaphore of our logo
comes from Peka, meaning ‘star’ in marquises islands dialect . 
Indeed, like
a star in the sky, our logo guides our vision. It connects the sun and the Polar
star as PKparis connects your world with its products. These two sources of
light have always been a guide for adventurers. With PK products, you can
navigate the digital realm as you choose.
Finally,
all our products are designed in Paris by a pool of talented designers, tying
us to a long tradition of excellence and elegance, but also to a desire to
engage with the future now. This ‘French touch’ is evident throughout our
product range.

<p><strong>Beloved App Since 2014 To Easily Know &amp; Use Your Period And Fertility Potential. Life Might Be One Big Mystery - But Your Cycles Don't Have To Be...</strong></p>
<p>The time has come for your favorite app - My Moontime - to get updated or be gone forever. Apple’s latest App Store updates require apps to meet certain standards and we have decided to turn to you, our loyal supporters, friends and family - in order to help us fund those important updates. </p>
<p><strong>What Is My Moontime App?</strong> – Click Here to find out more about how this unique app can change the way you live your everyday life. Featured in HuffPost, BuzzFeed, Marie Claire and Nylon Magazine, My Moontime has helped thousands of women keep track of their cycles, hormones and inner energy flow!</p>
<p>As you already know, My Moontime app is a 100% independent project developed and funded by Dana Michelle Gillespie, a certified skin care specialist, meditation and EMA dance teacher. She wanted to help other women keep track of their menstrual cycle and moon cycle in order to enhance their awareness and achieve a balanced hormone cycle and life. Once she launched the app, it became an overnight success, with over 26,000 women downloading and using it daily.</p>
<p><strong>Want To Keep Using The App?</strong> – Then we need your support in order to comply with Apple’s App Store rules. This new updates requires an extra $40,000 and it’s up to you to help us launch the updated version on both iOS and Android WORLDWIDE.

<p>""I created this app for myself. I needed a way to track both my menstrual cycle and the moon cycle, as well as the energy potential of the both of them combined - so I could go about my day with more awareness and understanding of myself. Otherwise I tried to track my cycle with other apps and by hand and I would always loose track and show up to work pms-ing and during a full moon and they would surprisingly be the worst days ever. Having this app has helped me know what's coming ahead and plan accordingly and take better care of myself."" - Dana Gillespie, My Moontime App Creator</p>

<b>
</b><p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 13.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Helvetica; color: #212121;"">You stabilize a video camera by putting high-inertia mass underneath it to dampen out the little jiggles and wiggles that distinguish amateur video work from professional work. Existing camera steady products provide this heavy mass within the product itself — of course, making them big, bulky, and heavy devices.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<b></b><p style="""">WeeSteady intelligently uses the mass of your own arm and body to stabilize your camera or phone videos. It turns out that most of that annoying jittery motion comes from a combination of the bad ergonomics involved in holding the camera with your hand, and the bad stability of your spindly fingers and wobbly wrist being in the mix.</p>

You hold weeSteady the same way pros have held video cameras for decades — with your hand lightly closed and your fist turned parallel to your shooting direction.</p> <p></p>

<p></p></span></span></span></span></div>","Tiny cameras with HD video capability create big issues with shake and jitter. Unfortunately, camera stabilizers (or ""steadies"") are still big, bulky monsters, not at all appropriate for these miniature cameras and phones. This is the reality that led to creating the weeSteady.
* Note: weeSteady requires a tripod adapter to use with an iPhone or other smartphone.
* Demo: See the Gallery link above for a video showing the weeSteady in use shooting an iPhone video. Wow!

How weeSteady Works

You stabilize a video camera by putting high-inertia mass underneath it to dampen out the little jiggles and wiggles that distinguish amateur video work from professional work. Existing camera steady products provide this heavy mass within the product itself — of course, making them big, bulky, and heavy devices.





WeeSteady intelligently uses the mass of your own arm and body to stabilize your camera or phone videos. It turns out that most of that annoying jittery motion comes from a combination of the bad ergonomics involved in holding the camera with your hand, and the bad stability of your spindly fingers and wobbly wrist being in the mix.
 

WeeSteady is gripped in your palm, with the camera mount extending upward between two fingers, inside your lightly closed fist. You hold weeSteady the same way pros have held video cameras for decades — with your hand lightly closed and your fist turned parallel to your shooting direction. 

The result? Massively more stable video shots!








Design & Construction





I have a powerful aversion to paying good money for cheaply made products. So, in developing the weeSteady I decided I wanted to create a ""lifetime product,"" one that uses the most lavish materials and construction methods possible. After all, this should be a product you use on a regular basis for decades into the future. You want it to feel like a professional product in your hand, and to never corrode, or break, or fall apart. Right?


WeeSteady is made from investment cast 316 stainless steel, electropolished to a gorgeous permanent sheen. The tripod stud and the lock nut are also made from 316 stainless steel. I could have used plastic, I guess. Instead, I chose to go for extreme quality. The result is the most extremely over-engineered and over-built little camera gadget you've ever touched.
The weeSteady Project



I have been doing product development work for clients for the past 35-years, and have had this growing idea for accessories for the smallest cameras for some time. I've done the design and prototyping and product testing. I've sourced the materials and suppliers. Now, I'm ready to quickly take the weeSteady to mass production and into the marketplace.

Delivery For Christmas Guaranteed!

weeSteady parts are being cast and machined locally in Tennessee and assembled and packaged right here in Nashville. This lets me work swiftly and have the entire process close by, and... very importantly, allows me to safely guarantee shipping all weeSteady pre-orders on or before December 10th, 2013 — easily in time for Christmas delivery!




Use Of Funds
I want to treat this like I am sharing a project with investors, not just ""donators."" I am not a charity, and you are not here to just give away money. That said, the funds from this project will be used (a) to pay for mass production tooling, (b) to pay for packaging tooling, (c) to pay for final assembly and shipping from my warehouse, and (d) to hopefully generate some profits to seed additional weeGadgets products for small camera users.
The timetable for the project is (a) close out the fully funded project in 14-days, (b) wait 7-days for PayPal to release the funds, (c) immediately pay my suppliers for the tooling and mass production quantity order, plus as many more units as the money raised will allow. Tooling and review of sample parts will take 5-weeks. Mass production, assembly, and receipt of the products to my warehouse will take 3-weeks. So, there will be about an 8-week dead period following the release of funds before I can ship your products to you.
Add it up and you have the project closing, and 9-weeks later your products being shipped to you. Of course, I will provide regular updates as the process unfolds, so you will always know exactly where things stand in getting your products delivered to you.

But you also want to keep your iPhone protected to preserve your experience for the months and years to come? Then you probably know the frustration that comes with unboxing your iPhone just to box it right back into one of the many bulky, unaesthetic veils called phone cases. We think: No more choosing between experiencing and protecting your iPhone - why not have both?  That's why we crafted Arc Pulse: The case your iPhone deserves. MEET ARC PULSE With Arc Pulse, you can finally enjoy the iPhone experience while preserving it, too - no compromises. At Arc, you are the center of our development efforts.Here are our some of our features and opinions of media and early testers: Arc Pulse's key features:Preserves the iPhone experienceProtection where it mattersPatented two-part minimalist design Precision made aerospace grade metals Silver titanium and black aluminumNo 5G signal interferenceAvailable for all iPhone 12 models OUR PHILOSOPHYToday, phone case manufacturers are busy designing larger, stronger, or more aesthetic cases. Meanwhile, they forget what they were trying to achieve in the first place - preserving the iPhone experience.With Arc Pulse, you can experience your iPhone as it was intended to be. During our design process, we extract essential features - those aspects of your iPhone that matter most to you, true to our motto: Essential Design.Essential Engineering.Essentially for You.  The essential features we identified together with our hundreds of testers are Design, Interaction, and Protection. Follow us along as we demonstrate what these features mean for your new iPhone experience.  DESIGNShow your iPhone.When you buy an iPhone, you don’t just buy a phone, you buy an experience. An experience worth protecting, but an experience that should remain true to itself.  We present the most essential iPhone case design yet.    INTERACTIONFeel your iPhone.​How does it feel to hold your iPhone without a case? The feel of gorgeous surgical-grade stainless steel band combined with the precision-milled matte glass back - right at your fingertips. This is an interaction worth preserving.  Yet, typical phone cases require you to say goodbye to the premium experience. They add bulk and weight and replace luxurious materials with plastic. It's time that our iPhone cases match the design standards we value in our iPhones.The Arc Pulse preserves your intended iPhone interaction like no other case before. Its ultra-slim design and aerospace-grade, high-quality metal surfaces strive to match the iPhone's interaction standards.  Great interaction doesn't just mean great aesthetics and material feel. Simplicity in design is key. That's why we match the iPhone's simple, elegant design as closely as possible. With our slide-on fit™, it's simple to add to your iPhone, ensuring perfect fit out of the box. For ease of use, all components of the Arc Pulse will be tightly bonded together. Here you can see the two components and how the Arc Pulse is added to your phone. Simple as that.  But how well does slide-on fit work? Here is a little demonstration:Do you agree that your iPhone’s luxurious, well-crafted materials should be at your fingertips at any time?   PROTECTIONProtect your iPhone.Among our three essential features, protection presented a challenging engineering challenge. We asked ourselves, how can we provide you with the perfect balance of protection and original feel. How can we protect the iPhone experience without compromising it? Our answer:Protection where it matters most. High-tech materials and top of the line manufacturing techniques are fused in a dual-layer protection design. Aerospace-grade titanium and aluminum distribute the shock of an impact across the surface of Arc Pulse. Then, a shock absorbent, custom-engineered inner layer absorbs the impact - keeping your iPhone safe.Whether it's the front, back, or camera of your iPhone, Arc Pulse has you covered.  The Arc Pulse's dual-layer protection system combines the best of two worlds, the shock distribution properties of a hard shell and shock absorption of a soft inner layer. Distributing the force of an impactOur primary protection objective is your iPhone. Still, we went out of our way to select the best materials and surface finishes to keep the Arc Pulse looking as new as ever after a drop.Titanium Grade 5 has an extraordinary strength to weight ratio. It's light & highly corrosion resistant yet guarantees some of the best resistance to drops and shocks.Aluminum 7075 is already one of the most resistant aluminum types available. Both metals are tagged ""aerospace"" for a reason. By first heat treating the metal and then hardening the surface of the Arc Pulse Aluminum we push the material to its limits.Both metals are precision manufactured and polished with CNC-Milling. Absorbing the shockWe combine the premium metals with a custom engineered inner layer that absorbs the shock of an impact. The Arc Team joined forces with a senior partner experienced in developing shock resistant impact materials in the automobile industry. Together, we developed a material that is perfect for the Arc Pulse protection system. This layer is tightly bonded to the metal shell. WHY WE NEED YOUR HELPTogether with you we want to reshape technology interaction. To bring Arc Pulse: The case your iPhone deserves we depend on your support.We've come a long way since the first 3D-printed models shown below. These here are two of our earliest prototypes - the first one isn't pretty, but the second one got the vision across and our feedback & early support was amazing. Thank you everyone who supported us early! You really helped us pull through a challenging year.  Since then, Arc Pulse has gone through dozens of design iterations, material changes, finish alterations and manufacturability checks. We successfully acquired private funding & government subsidies to investigate, validate and prototype Arc Pulse. Today, we are at the next step in bringing the Arc Pulse to you.   Hardware products have a key challenge: You need the numbers. In other words, industrial production requires sufficient initial funds. Every of your contributions goes directly to taking the final steps towards production and bringing the Arc Pulse to you.Our partners are waiting for our go. Once we reach our goal we will take the final steps before beginning production. However, we value transparency: We are at the end of our prototyping stage, but not quite yet in the production stage. Some fine-tuning development steps require us to start parts of the production process first. Most notably the creation of Tooling. As a final step before production we will again fine-tune the last aspects of Arc Pulse. We have validated our slide-on fit™ in rigorous testing steps throughout the last months already. After creating the final tooling, we will again ensure the Arc Pulse fits to your iPhone perfectly, every time.We are looking forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the next months with regular updates. If you have any questions, feedback or concerns - send us a message through Indiegogo or any of our social media channels! STRETCH GOALSOur goal at Arc is to reshape your technology interaction. We seek to apply essential design and engineering to other products to expand the Arc Pulse ecosystem. Apple's new MagSafe feature opened an exciting avenue for us to explore. First on his shortlist is a mag safe wallet that matches the essential design of the Arc Pulse. If we reach 800 sales, every backer will receive priority access to the best price we will ever offer for this perfectly matching add-on. Additionally, we plan to expand the color range of the Arc Pulse - the new iPhones provide exciting color palettes we'd love to match.  REWARD TIERS  MEET OUR TEAMThe Arc Team was established in 2019 by technology enthusiasts with the common goal of reshaping technology interaction.

     XCAN is the world's first wireless charger that uses NFC technology. XCAN is innovating right now. Place your smartphone onto the holder, and it will automatically start navigating! It’s now time to say good bye to your old car phone mounts and chargers!Other products are designed with infrared (IR) sensors which are famous for use in fire detectors. IR sensors detect all kinds of objects, even your hands moving in the air. Because of this, the device could releases your phone and could cause an accident.Unlike IR sensor products, the FOD (foreign object detection) sensor only recognizes digital signals. This makes it much safer than existing products with no worry about dropping your phone. It’s safe. By putting your phone on XCAN, it immediately recognizes and automatically holds your smartphone.You can release the auto-hold by pushing a button.    XCAN is designed to release your smartphone when the electric current is cut off, allowing you to easily pick up your phone.Do not waste your time for picking up your phone. Carrying both a charger and phone mount every day is such a hassle, especially tangled cables that interrupt you while driving.But, you do not need to bring all of these every time. XCAN solves these problems all at once. Simply put, it’s a 2-in-1 device for dual wireless phone charging and holding.We recommend using QC 3.0 Charger for fast wireless charging. XCAN is compatible with both iPhone (since XS model) and Android OS smartphones. With just one XCAN, you can set different settings for an Android smartphone and an iPhone respectively . (e.g. Android-Google Map / iOS-Apple Map)With the XCAN you can use navigation, play music, and so much more without worrying about your phone’s battery life. You can adjust the angle and distance of XCAN to place your phone on it.Also, the package includes two types of holders which you can use according to your situation. There is a dashboard mount that can be attached to a glass surface ora blower clip that can be clipped on to the air conditioning blower.   NFC and wireless chargers use the same induced current. As a result, interference happens between them. While wireless charging, ​your smartphone works as a receiver. Also, the smartphone performs as a transmitter when you use the NFC function.When using the NFC function and wireless charging together, the wireless charging has a stronger frequency band than NFC. As a result, NFC could not send the stored information to your phone due to not getting electric power. If the phone has NFC, the electricity flows from phone to NFC. In other words, this boosts to run the phone battery out. XCAN is designed to block the wireless charging function first and use NFC. After NFC recognition, the power used for NFC is transferred to wireless charging.XCAN seems to operate NFC and wireless charging at the same time. Actually, NFC activates first, and later the charging function is working. When removing the phone, XCAN resets itself so that it recognizes NFC again. CNA has certifications and patents for this technology.  How to install XCAN inside the car1. Dashboard mountSnap the ball onto the body of XCAN's and then fix the nut by turning it.

<h3></h3>
<p><b>In Brief</b></p>
<p>We are going to create a smartphone app that uses biometrics, instead of national identity systems, to generate reliable credit information. We think that if microfinance lenders used our app it would help microfinance live up to its potential as a vehicle for global change and economic progress, with real benefits for both borrowers and lenders. Please read on for more information and don't forget to share our campaign when you're done!</p>
<p><b>A Little Background and Explanation</b></p>
<p>In the last few decades, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">microfinance </a>has revolutionized commercial lending by making funds available to demographic segments that were previously shut out of conventional banking markets. Microfinance lenders (we also call them MFIs, for Micro Finance Institutions) make small, unsecured loans to borrowers who then use the money to start their own business. Under the original model of microfinance lending created by Muhammad Yunus in 1976, the borrower gains access to funding by joining a small lending circle whose members support and monitor them to make sure they are behaving responsibly. Repayment is guaranteed only by the borrower’s reputation in the community. Thus, by taking out the loan, the borrower essentially collateralizes the loan with their social standing.</p>
<p>Nothing prevents the borrower from joining multiple lending circles and taking out multiple loans. Furthermore, not every microfinance lender utilizes the lending circle model. In South Africa, microfinance lenders resemble traditional banks in that they have brick and mortar branches with loan agents inside; there is no need to join a lending circle. Blue Financial even used to advertise that their customers would be able to secure a loan from them in under an hour.</p>
<p>In 2010, India’s microfinance market was rocked by a crisis.  Borrowers in the state of Andhra Pradesh were becoming over-indebted and the lenders were not practicing ethical collection behavior. One particularly horrific <a href=""http://governancexborders.com/2010/10/25/andhra-pradeshs-animal-farm-the-chickens-have-come-home-to-roost/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">example</a> of unethical lending behavior is of <b>lenders who encouraged borrowers to commit suicide</b> so that the proceeds of their life insurance policy could be used to pay off the loan. Growing numbers of borrower suicides embroiled the microfinance industry in a public scandal, with populist politicians denouncing lenders for loan sharking behavior and urging borrowers to intentionally default on outstanding loans. Microfinance's reputation for being a social impact vehicle took a huge hit as a result of the Indian crisis and other similar crises in other countries.</p>
<p>The Indian crisis generated a <a href=""http://www.smartcampaign.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">global campaign</a> against over-indebtedness, as well as the idea for Luminos. Despite the backlash against microfinance, a number of researchers have concluded that the inaccessibility of credit is one of the primary challenges restraining developing economies, and so microfinance will continue to be a growing market in developing economies. But <b>traditional credit bureaus are ill-equipped to address the needs of the growing microfinance market.</b> Often times there isn't a strong national system of identification akin to the Social Security Number we use in the United states. In general, the typical microfinance borrower is characterized by the absence of any recorded interaction with national institutions like the courts or banking system. But even in the absence of such information, there is a reliable way to keep track of borrowers: with biometrics. Biometrics provides a reliable way of verifying a person's identity in countries with weak national institutions, and so biometrics will be a key piece of our solution. </p>
<p><b>What We Want to Do</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/149965/files/20131023065140-luminos_LumiKnow_color.jpg?1382536300"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our solution is LumiKnow. LumiKnow is a mobile app specifically tailored for microfinance institutions using biometrics. It will have the capability to interact with our database in order to deliver meaningful information about borrowers to the lending agent. The app will utilize a borrower's biometric as the “primary key” of our database, meaning <b>the borrower’s biometrics will drive the database search to call up the borrower’s information</b> for the lending agent. The app will also come in a free version (with a limited number of searches) so that anybody with a smartphone (not many now but growing!) can see the information being provided about them, and thereby make it easy for a borrower to see if the information is correct. After utilizing our product, the lender will know for certain whether the borrower has any other outstanding loans; whether the borrower has or has not already been judged bankable by a reputable agent; and if the borrower has already received a microloan. In short, the goal is to make it easy and cost effective for microfinance lenders to find out whether a potential borrower is ""bankable.""</p>
<p><b>How LumiKnow Will Help People</b></p>
<p>1. Prevention of over-indebtedness.</p>
<p>LumiKnow will make the information lenders need to prevent over-indebtedness readily accessible and cost effective. Over-indebtedness is the primary challenge that has yet to be overcome in microfinance markets. The material consequences of over-indebtedness consist of a wide range of additional costs to those who are already struggling financially. <b>In the worst case scenario, over-indebtedness actually leads to further impoverishment.</b> The microfinance industry recognizes that overindebtedness among microfinance borrowers is the most pressing risk facing the industry because it has the potential to cause both financial and reputational damage to the entire industry. Damage to the entire industry harms MFIs even in countries where the problem does not exist. </p>
<p><b>Over-indebtedness is avoidable.</b> A good start for lenders is implementing conscientious lending standards, such as those promulgated by the <a href=""http://www.smartcampaign.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SMART Campaign</a>. Most importantly, however, lenders must find bankable clients. The process of identifying such individuals, called character risk due diligence, is time consuming and costly. Loan agents must query the borrower at length, and then make home visits to further verify the information. If there is no system for sharing borrower information between MFIs, this process must be completed for every new borrower. In some microfinance markets, lenders resorted to sharing an excel spreadsheet back and forth. Allowing a third party like Luminos to assemble and synthesize this information is much more efficient for an MFI. Once the character risk due diligence is performed by one MFI, it does not need to be performed again if every MFI has a way to access that information. Access to that crucial information is the service we aim to provide with the LumiKnow Mobile App, and it will go a long way towards preventing over-indebtedness.</p>
<p>2. Increase repayment tendency.</p>
<p>LumiKnow revolutionizes the notion that a poor person's reputation is adequate collateral to secure repayment of a loan, and will have dramatic effects on borrower repayment tendencies. A <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w17449"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">study</a> of better borrower identification in Malawi found that <b>total loan repayment was 92.2% among fingerprinted borrowers</b>, compared to only 66.7% in the control group. Similar results were seen in a Guatemalan <a href=""http://are.berkeley.edu/~esadoulet/papers/BasisBrief.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">study</a> showing the amount of a lender’s portfolio in arrears (unpaid/overdue) decreased from 67.2% to 52.8% after the implementation of credit bureaus. The following graphic sums up this market effect:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/143921/files/20131020111433-Flowchart2_Final.jpg?1382292873"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>3. Cheaper loans for worthy individuals. </p>
<p>With more information, <b>lenders are better able to assess risk, and offer loans at lower rates to less risky individuals</b>. LumiKnow will provide information that will make it less risky for lenders to make loans. Risk and interest rates are directly proportional, that is, the higher the risk, the higher the interest rate. </p>
<p>4. Help MFIs lend to poorer clients.</p>
<p>Because poorer borrowers tend to repay less often, microfinance institutions are forced to distribute larger loans to relatively well off borrowers to cover the loss of unpaid loans. Private credit bureaus help alleviate this problem, by creating borrower profiles that MFIs use to accurately assess an individuals’ risk and craft appropriate lending terms, based on more than just personal wealth. A <a href=""http://are.berkeley.edu/~esadoulet/papers/BasisBrief.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">study</a> of the Guatemalan microfinance system found that the establishment of credit bureaus allowed lenders to reach borrowers with an average total asset value of 3,000 quetzales (USD 382.53) down from 11,000 quetzales (USD 1,402.61), representing <b>a 73% decrease in wealth requirements.</b></p>
<p>5. Faster recognition of troubled borrowers, allowing MFIs to address these borrowers sooner.</p>
<p>In most credit systems, there is a considerable delay between the point where borrowers are getting into trouble and the point where the problem becomes apparent in the collection statistics of lenders. <b>LumiKnow would diminish the time it takes to recognize a troubled borrower</b>, especially when providing real-time reporting. </p>
<p>6. Help keep the MFIs’ books in better health, thereby preventing downsizing or closure, and providing continued opportunities for borrowers.</p>
<p>LumiKnow will allow MFIs to more accurate select borrowers according to their risk profile and balance the risk weightings of their portfolios. In microfinance, what's good for the goose is good for the gander (i.e., lenders and borrowers, respectively). If MFIs are able to do their business better, <b>borrowers will reap the benefit of an efficient, strong market that affords opportunity to meritorious individuals.</b> Everyone wins. </p>

</div></div>","In Brief
We are going to create a smartphone app that uses biometrics, instead of national identity systems, to generate reliable credit information. We think that if microfinance lenders used our app it would help microfinance live up to its potential as a vehicle for global change and economic progress, with real benefits for both borrowers and lenders. Please read on for more information and don't forget to share our campaign when you're done!
A Little Background and Explanation
In the last few decades, microfinance has revolutionized commercial lending by making funds available to demographic segments that were previously shut out of conventional banking markets. Microfinance lenders (we also call them MFIs, for Micro Finance Institutions) make small, unsecured loans to borrowers who then use the money to start their own business. Under the original model of microfinance lending created by Muhammad Yunus in 1976, the borrower gains access to funding by joining a small lending circle whose members support and monitor them to make sure they are behaving responsibly. Repayment is guaranteed only by the borrower’s reputation in the community. Thus, by taking out the loan, the borrower essentially collateralizes the loan with their social standing.
Nothing prevents the borrower from joining multiple lending circles and taking out multiple loans. Furthermore, not every microfinance lender utilizes the lending circle model. In South Africa, microfinance lenders resemble traditional banks in that they have brick and mortar branches with loan agents inside; there is no need to join a lending circle. Blue Financial even used to advertise that their customers would be able to secure a loan from them in under an hour.
In 2010, India’s microfinance market was rocked by a crisis.  Borrowers in the state of Andhra Pradesh were becoming over-indebted and the lenders were not practicing ethical collection behavior. One particularly horrific example of unethical lending behavior is of lenders who encouraged borrowers to commit suicide so that the proceeds of their life insurance policy could be used to pay off the loan. Growing numbers of borrower suicides embroiled the microfinance industry in a public scandal, with populist politicians denouncing lenders for loan sharking behavior and urging borrowers to intentionally default on outstanding loans. Microfinance's reputation for being a social impact vehicle took a huge hit as a result of the Indian crisis and other similar crises in other countries.
The Indian crisis generated a global campaign against over-indebtedness, as well as the idea for Luminos. Despite the backlash against microfinance, a number of researchers have concluded that the inaccessibility of credit is one of the primary challenges restraining developing economies, and so microfinance will continue to be a growing market in developing economies. But traditional credit bureaus are ill-equipped to address the needs of the growing microfinance market. Often times there isn't a strong national system of identification akin to the Social Security Number we use in the United states. In general, the typical microfinance borrower is characterized by the absence of any recorded interaction with national institutions like the courts or banking system. But even in the absence of such information, there is a reliable way to keep track of borrowers: with biometrics. Biometrics provides a reliable way of verifying a person's identity in countries with weak national institutions, and so biometrics will be a key piece of our solution. 
What We Want to Do



Our solution is LumiKnow. LumiKnow is a mobile app specifically tailored for microfinance institutions using biometrics. It will have the capability to interact with our database in order to deliver meaningful information about borrowers to the lending agent. The app will utilize a borrower's biometric as the “primary key” of our database, meaning the borrower’s biometrics will drive the database search to call up the borrower’s information for the lending agent. The app will also come in a free version (with a limited number of searches) so that anybody with a smartphone (not many now but growing!) can see the information being provided about them, and thereby make it easy for a borrower to see if the information is correct. After utilizing our product, the lender will know for certain whether the borrower has any other outstanding loans; whether the borrower has or has not already been judged bankable by a reputable agent; and if the borrower has already received a microloan. In short, the goal is to make it easy and cost effective for microfinance lenders to find out whether a potential borrower is ""bankable.""
How LumiKnow Will Help People
1. Prevention of over-indebtedness.
LumiKnow will make the information lenders need to prevent over-indebtedness readily accessible and cost effective. Over-indebtedness is the primary challenge that has yet to be overcome in microfinance markets. The material consequences of over-indebtedness consist of a wide range of additional costs to those who are already struggling financially. In the worst case scenario, over-indebtedness actually leads to further impoverishment. The microfinance industry recognizes that overindebtedness among microfinance borrowers is the most pressing risk facing the industry because it has the potential to cause both financial and reputational damage to the entire industry. Damage to the entire industry harms MFIs even in countries where the problem does not exist. 
Over-indebtedness is avoidable. A good start for lenders is implementing conscientious lending standards, such as those promulgated by the SMART Campaign. Most importantly, however, lenders must find bankable clients. The process of identifying such individuals, called character risk due diligence, is time consuming and costly. Loan agents must query the borrower at length, and then make home visits to further verify the information. If there is no system for sharing borrower information between MFIs, this process must be completed for every new borrower. In some microfinance markets, lenders resorted to sharing an excel spreadsheet back and forth. Allowing a third party like Luminos to assemble and synthesize this information is much more efficient for an MFI. Once the character risk due diligence is performed by one MFI, it does not need to be performed again if every MFI has a way to access that information. Access to that crucial information is the service we aim to provide with the LumiKnow Mobile App, and it will go a long way towards preventing over-indebtedness.
2. Increase repayment tendency.
LumiKnow revolutionizes the notion that a poor person's reputation is adequate collateral to secure repayment of a loan, and will have dramatic effects on borrower repayment tendencies. A study of better borrower identification in Malawi found that total loan repayment was 92.2% among fingerprinted borrowers, compared to only 66.7% in the control group. Similar results were seen in a Guatemalan study showing the amount of a lender’s portfolio in arrears (unpaid/overdue) decreased from 67.2% to 52.8% after the implementation of credit bureaus. The following graphic sums up this market effect:



3. Cheaper loans for worthy individuals. 
With more information, lenders are better able to assess risk, and offer loans at lower rates to less risky individuals. LumiKnow will provide information that will make it less risky for lenders to make loans. Risk and interest rates are directly proportional, that is, the higher the risk, the higher the interest rate. 
4. Help MFIs lend to poorer clients.
Because poorer borrowers tend to repay less often, microfinance institutions are forced to distribute larger loans to relatively well off borrowers to cover the loss of unpaid loans. Private credit bureaus help alleviate this problem, by creating borrower profiles that MFIs use to accurately assess an individuals’ risk and craft appropriate lending terms, based on more than just personal wealth. A study of the Guatemalan microfinance system found that the establishment of credit bureaus allowed lenders to reach borrowers with an average total asset value of 3,000 quetzales (USD 382.53) down from 11,000 quetzales (USD 1,402.61), representing a 73% decrease in wealth requirements.
5. Faster recognition of troubled borrowers, allowing MFIs to address these borrowers sooner.
In most credit systems, there is a considerable delay between the point where borrowers are getting into trouble and the point where the problem becomes apparent in the collection statistics of lenders. LumiKnow would diminish the time it takes to recognize a troubled borrower, especially when providing real-time reporting. 
6. Help keep the MFIs’ books in better health, thereby preventing downsizing or closure, and providing continued opportunities for borrowers.
LumiKnow will allow MFIs to more accurate select borrowers according to their risk profile and balance the risk weightings of their portfolios. In microfinance, what's good for the goose is good for the gander (i.e., lenders and borrowers, respectively). If MFIs are able to do their business better, borrowers will reap the benefit of an efficient, strong market that affords opportunity to meritorious individuals. Everyone wins.

<strong><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">About The Moto Dawg<br/><br/></span></strong>In this brave new world, keeping accurate records and receipts for everything you do, buy... or whatever...  is a must. Because if you don’t you will end up on the short end of the stick.
<p>Just like you have tax records and medical records for yourself along with bank records and financial records for your home and business, keeping ""tight"" records for maintenance and repairs... along with any upgrades or modifications... for your motorcycle is just as important.</p>
<p>But digging through a box of oil stained, wadded up old paperwork trying to find work orders and receipts for a repair... maintenance... modifications... warranty work... or that special component that has been installed on your motorcycle sucks and can be like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>And if and when you do find it... chances are it’s almost impossible to read because the ink that's used in the receipt printers ends up disappearing like a David Copperfield magic trick!</p>
<p>This is where the Moto Dawg mobile app steps up and crushes the problem. With this... simple to use and ultra-dependable... mobile app, any motorcycle owner can securely store, and update all of their service, repairs, upgrades and modification/customization records along with other important documents at lightning speed and easily retrieve them with the tap and swipe of a finger whenever they need them!</p>
<p>The best part of the Moto Dawg app is that because all the stored and secured information is local to the users’ phone, it can be accessed with ...or without... coverage allowing riders to have all their data with them wherever they are.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if it’s 2 wheels, 3 wheels, On-road, Off-road, Sport bike, Cruiser, Touring, Custom... or whatever. Motorcycle owners can now enjoy the peace of mind of having a secured, easy to access and FREE ""tool"" for keeping track of ALL their motorcycle information sitting right in the palm of their hand.</p>

<h2>The Impact Of The Moto Dawg White Label Project</h2>
<p>The Moto Dawg App has been a project that consumed the best part of 2012 with development. After completion of the beta testing phase, the app was auditioned to various insurance and extended warranty companies in the motorcycle industry for their approval as proof of valid record keeping from motorcycle owners when dealing with claims.</p>
<p>Recognizing the huge benefits of having repair and maintenance records digital stored and easily accessible... along with the tamperproof feature so they couldn’t be altered... our new technology was welcomed with open arms to the market place.</p>
<p>But within a short time of being available to the motorcycle public, we started to get requests from the big franchise motorcycle dealers... as well as smaller repair shop operators... wanting to know if it was possible to get their own version of the Moto Dawg app so they could brand it with their own graphics and business information and provide to their own customer base.</p>
<p>After taking a look at what was going on in the industry, it was very apparent that the mobile marketing options available for motorcycle businesses were either very limited, and in most cases, did not exist at all.</p>
<p>So we dug in even deeper and ran some test marketing campaigns to make sure that if we went ahead and put the effort into creating a private label opportunity, the demand was going to be there. To put it mildly, the demand was overwhelming and they all wanted it yesterday.</p>
<p>The big problem we encountered was that the initial setup fee to rebuild our app and include all of the killer features it has built into it just wasn’t cost effective.</p>
<p>After looking at several options that would be more cost friendly, our tech guys came up with the brilliant concept of developing our own custom software platform that will clone our Android and iOS Moto Dawg app as a white label product. That way we can avoid all of enormous costs associated with app development.</p>
<p>With this platform in place, each motorcycle business has the ability to customize the appearance of the app and create a dealer-to-customer line of communications through the app without having to spend a fortune on development.</p>
<p>One more thing... this platform integrates with all of the social media the business may be using along with including a mobile website function to tie into their existing html website.</p>
<p>This really is an ideal situation for the typically non-technical small motorcycle dealer or repair shop because it requires no software expenditure or technical skills along with giving the businesses a distinct competitive advantage against their competitors.</p>
<p>Simply put... this software platform gives any motorcycle business the opportunity to supply their customers... free of charge... with a very valuable piece of mobile technology that not only offers a huge benefit to the motorcycle owner, ...but also provides a huge financial... and customer retention benefit... to the business owners without the huge upfront costs associated with mobile app development.</p>
<h2>Why we need you and what your help will do...</h2>
<p>As one would expect, there’s been many challenges in creating this white label software program. For one, there is no other in existence, and because there are no models to go off of, we had to do a lot of research and brainstorming to bring the concept together that would actually perform as we envisioned it. So needless to say, we’ve come up a little short of what we need to complete it. If you should decide to contribute, here’s what your contribution will help us do:</p>
<p><strong>• Finalize the software platform development.</strong><br/><strong>• Setup the membership website and video tutorials for the businesses            <br/></strong><strong>   participating in our white label program.<br/></strong><strong>• Put our marketing campaign on steroids.</strong></p>
<h2><span>The Whole Enchilada!</span></h2>
<p>As you can see, we've put together some very cool ""perk-packages"" in exchange for your help.</p>
<p>The most exciting of them is a rare chance for you to score a super fine 2009 vintage wine from the Dry Creek Valley in California which is home to some of the best wines in the world.</p>
<p>The wine master of this vineyard... who is a personal friend... has agreed to help us out by generously reserving the last few cases of this very cool themed vintage so that we are able to offer them to you.  </p>

<p> </p></div>","About The Moto DawgIn this brave new world, keeping accurate records and receipts for everything you do, buy... or whatever...  is a must. Because if you don’t you will end up on the short end of the stick.
Just like you have tax records and medical records for yourself along with bank records and financial records for your home and business, keeping ""tight"" records for maintenance and repairs... along with any upgrades or modifications... for your motorcycle is just as important.
But digging through a box of oil stained, wadded up old paperwork trying to find work orders and receipts for a repair... maintenance... modifications... warranty work... or that special component that has been installed on your motorcycle sucks and can be like looking for a needle in a haystack.
And if and when you do find it... chances are it’s almost impossible to read because the ink that's used in the receipt printers ends up disappearing like a David Copperfield magic trick!
This is where the Moto Dawg mobile app steps up and crushes the problem. With this... simple to use and ultra-dependable... mobile app, any motorcycle owner can securely store, and update all of their service, repairs, upgrades and modification/customization records along with other important documents at lightning speed and easily retrieve them with the tap and swipe of a finger whenever they need them!
The best part of the Moto Dawg app is that because all the stored and secured information is local to the users’ phone, it can be accessed with ...or without... coverage allowing riders to have all their data with them wherever they are.
It doesn’t matter if it’s 2 wheels, 3 wheels, On-road, Off-road, Sport bike, Cruiser, Touring, Custom... or whatever. Motorcycle owners can now enjoy the peace of mind of having a secured, easy to access and FREE ""tool"" for keeping track of ALL their motorcycle information sitting right in the palm of their hand.

The Impact Of The Moto Dawg White Label Project
The Moto Dawg App has been a project that consumed the best part of 2012 with development. After completion of the beta testing phase, the app was auditioned to various insurance and extended warranty companies in the motorcycle industry for their approval as proof of valid record keeping from motorcycle owners when dealing with claims.
Recognizing the huge benefits of having repair and maintenance records digital stored and easily accessible... along with the tamperproof feature so they couldn’t be altered... our new technology was welcomed with open arms to the market place.
But within a short time of being available to the motorcycle public, we started to get requests from the big franchise motorcycle dealers... as well as smaller repair shop operators... wanting to know if it was possible to get their own version of the Moto Dawg app so they could brand it with their own graphics and business information and provide to their own customer base.
After taking a look at what was going on in the industry, it was very apparent that the mobile marketing options available for motorcycle businesses were either very limited, and in most cases, did not exist at all.
So we dug in even deeper and ran some test marketing campaigns to make sure that if we went ahead and put the effort into creating a private label opportunity, the demand was going to be there. To put it mildly, the demand was overwhelming and they all wanted it yesterday.
The big problem we encountered was that the initial setup fee to rebuild our app and include all of the killer features it has built into it just wasn’t cost effective.
After looking at several options that would be more cost friendly, our tech guys came up with the brilliant concept of developing our own custom software platform that will clone our Android and iOS Moto Dawg app as a white label product. That way we can avoid all of enormous costs associated with app development.
With this platform in place, each motorcycle business has the ability to customize the appearance of the app and create a dealer-to-customer line of communications through the app without having to spend a fortune on development.
One more thing... this platform integrates with all of the social media the business may be using along with including a mobile website function to tie into their existing html website.
This really is an ideal situation for the typically non-technical small motorcycle dealer or repair shop because it requires no software expenditure or technical skills along with giving the businesses a distinct competitive advantage against their competitors.
Simply put... this software platform gives any motorcycle business the opportunity to supply their customers... free of charge... with a very valuable piece of mobile technology that not only offers a huge benefit to the motorcycle owner, ...but also provides a huge financial... and customer retention benefit... to the business owners without the huge upfront costs associated with mobile app development.
Why we need you and what your help will do...
As one would expect, there’s been many challenges in creating this white label software program. For one, there is no other in existence, and because there are no models to go off of, we had to do a lot of research and brainstorming to bring the concept together that would actually perform as we envisioned it. So needless to say, we’ve come up a little short of what we need to complete it. If you should decide to contribute, here’s what your contribution will help us do:
• Finalize the software platform development.• Setup the membership website and video tutorials for the businesses               participating in our white label program.• Put our marketing campaign on steroids.
The Whole Enchilada!
As you can see, we've put together some very cool ""perk-packages"" in exchange for your help.
The most exciting of them is a rare chance for you to score a super fine 2009 vintage wine from the Dry Creek Valley in California which is home to some of the best wines in the world.
The wine master of this vineyard... who is a personal friend... has agreed to help us out by generously reserving the last few cases of this very cool themed vintage so that we are able to offer them to you.  
This Indiegogo campaign is for US consumers only and shipping for all our perks is free. Be sure to check out the bundles we want to send you!

But let's start from the very beginning!</p><p><strong>HOW IT STARTED OR: “BINGO, WE HAVE AN IDEA!”</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469973965/pzdsxvczjohmislzcoqi.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Like most modern people, we became totally addicted to our smartphones and can't imagine our lifes without endless text chats and calls with our friends, relatives, clients and bosses. The smartphone became to usnot only a means of communication but also an alarm clock, planner, calendar, map... to put it simply a live-saving and essential device! And as being a programmer is not a job but a lifestyle it means that we need to be available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. And we noted one thing: you can spend the whole day sitting next to your phone and it keeps absolute silence. But you need only to leave for two minutes to get you a coffee or something else and within this short period of time you'll receive at least five very important calls, ten extraordinary important SMS-messages and two or three reminders about calendar events of exceptional importance! Of course you can grab your smartphone every time when you got distracted for a few minutes to check whether you missed something but sometimes you simply don't think about it – especially if your head is full with a millions of other tasks. Of course the information about the missed call or unread message stays on your device and sooner or later you'll see it. But in some cases even one hour delay can have not very pleasant consequences. For example you can miss an attractive job offer or forget about a school performance of your beloved child simply because you didn't hear the reminder... Besides that, all these standard notification icons and info panels are boring as hell!</p><p>Anyway, on a nice day somewhere back in the middle of 2015 our idea machine Nick got a cool idea that was caught up by our whole team: why shouldn't we create our own mobile helper – a useful and functional app that reminds the smartphone user about important events in an unusual and funny way? That was the day when our project ADVISOR was born.</p><p><strong>STAGE 1. WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE</strong></p><p>We started our project from the development of the general concept. We've decided that our 'advisor' should be performed as a funny animated character that moves into the smartphone and starts to inform its owner about different important events. We decided to replace the boring standard phone notifications with funny scenes performed by this character. We also decided to add some purely entertaining scenes where the character makes some funny actions. Our app should operate above all other apps to ensure that the user for sure notices the important information. We also decided to add voice to the character's image so that it can use its voice to notify the user about the important events.</p><p>After some thoughts we decided to chose the image of a funny dog. Together with our designer we've created a charismatic character: the Dog, and created animated scenes with him. After the app is installed, the Dog settles right in your smartphone. Most of the time you don't see him but if something important happens and Dog needs to remind you about it he appears on the screen on the top of all other running apps. You get the impression that the funny character interacts with you like a real living creature and you'll for sure love his great personality!</p><p>In the first version of our app that was released in December 2015 we offer only four main notification types:</p><ul>
<li>about missed phone calls</li>
<li>about unread SMS-messages</li>
<li>about calendar events</li>
<li>built-in alarm clock</li>

WHAT ARE WE DOING RIGHT NOW</strong></p><p>The first version of our app was quite successful and received good user feedback. Now we have more than 21 thousand downloads in Google Play with an average ranking of 4.4 stars. That's a pretty good result for a startup project. But we don't want to stop at this point. We want to move this project forward so that it doesn't stay a simple reminder app for missed calls and messages. It should become a big and useful assistant app with a funny animated character that provides help for the smartphone users and becomes a real friend. This is the main new feature of our app that distinguishes it from any competitors. We want to add a whole bunch of new features to make a really useful helping tool. We also want to create a big collection of different characters with their own personalities (ninja, cat, girl, military man, cave man etc.) to chose from. To sum up, we want to transform the standard smartphone operation procedures into interesting animated scenarios that provide the users with happiness and positive emotions.</p><p>Now we work on the second version of our app. It will get as many es 13 new notification types covering the most popular messengers, email services and social networks: WhatsApp, Skype, Telegram, Facebook-Messenger, Wechat, Snapchat, Gmail, Mail.ru, Yandex.Mail, vk, google hangouts, instagram, twitter.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469973424/rqjrld1jf9p0ul0zyhnf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Our Dog will inform the smartphone users about missed emails and messages. We plan to finish the new version by September. The new set of notifications will drastically increase the app's functionality.</p><p><strong>STAGE 3. WHAT DO WE WANT IN THE FUTURE?</strong></p><p>But our plans don't stop here! We already have a whole bunch of ideas for the next versions. One of our next main tasks is the development of new funny and charming characters with unique animations so that every user can find the best helper based on his/her own preferences. </p><p>It would be cool if you can help us to decide what characters we should do next and what individual features should they have!</p><p>One more important task is the integration of new notifications. We distinguish two main types: internal smartphone functions (such as battery level, low memory resources etc.) and integration of external services (weather forecast, news and many others).</p><p>Here are some of the new functions that we want to dedicate to our 'Advisor' in future versions of our app:</p><ul>
<li>Notification about low smartphone memory</li>
<li>Notification about necessary clean-up</li>
<li>Notifications about low battery and charging</li>
<li>Notifications about the presence or absence of mobile networks</li>
<li>Notifications about available free wi-fi networks</li>
<li>Weather forecasts</li>
</ul><p>We also want to add new entertainment scenes, for example:</p><ul>
<li>In the morning: waking up, having a shower</li>
<li>Breakfast and dinner</li>
<li>Storylines during the day: peeking out from different screen edges, walking and laying on the screen, playing ball, singing songs, reactions when touched with the finger: grumbling, making angry noises, laughing...</li>
<li>In the evening: yawning and going to bed</li>
<li>In the night: snoring and sniffing (and being angry when woken up)</li>
</ul><p>We also want to make our ADVISOR international and add all most popular European and Asian languages, it means that the app needs to be translated at least in 20 main languages of the world.</p><p>The development of a really good and useful app is a long, complicated and expensive process and if we want to achieve a high-quality result it requires really big investments. Dear friends, and that's the point where we want to address you! We don't simply beg you for money, we offer you the participation in the development of a future high-quality product! And we also want to grant you with some nice presents and a huuuuuge plus-point to your karma ;))</p><p>We'll also be very thankful for your advices, tips or interesting ideas about the features or characters that you'd like to see in our app.</p><p><strong>WHAT DO YOU GET IN RETURN FOR YOUR DONATION</strong></p><p>To thank you we've prepared different types of rewards. Depending on the donated amount you can receive a nice souvenir or even leave your name in the history of our project! Besides that all contributors receive the current version of our app directly after the donation (please note that it's designed only for Android version 4.0.3 or higher). And most rewards include the future second version with unlimited access that will be provided after its release.</p><p>You can see the list of our great rewards on the right in the reward section (please note that the app is Android only)</p><p>Please note that the phisical goods (printed certificates, souvenir magnets, t-shirts) will be shipped out in two batches (after 30 days + allow us several days for the manufacturing and shipment procedures; and after 60 days + allow us several extra days for the manufacturing and shipment procedures)<br/> </p><p><strong>WHAT PURPOSES YOUR DONATIONS WILL BE USED FOR</strong></p><p>The current goal of our campaign is 40.750 US-Dollar. For sure you want to know what we plan to do with this money and how much it costs to develop a high-quality mobile app. We try to answer this question briefly.</p><p>1) Development of new characters. This is the most cost-intensive part of our project. It's necessary to understand that it's not enough simply to invent a new character's image and to draw it once. Each character not only needs an individual appearance, it also requires unique features and animations for all notification and entertainment scenes. Basically it means that we need to create, build up, draw and voice-over a lot of short cartoons. It's a very complicated work that requires not only the participation of our designers, but also the skills of experts in the sphere of digital animation because we want to provide the users with really unique characters having their own features, habits and personalities.</p><p>On the current stage we want to make at least one new character. The artwork and its adjustments for the creation of one character image require approximately 1.000 USD.</p><p>The development of the character features and action scenarios for one image costs about 500 USD.</p><p>Each new character requires 10 notification animations: four already available actions from the first app version:</p><ul>
<li>missed calls</li>
<li>unread SMS-messages</li>
<li>calendar events</li>
<li>signals of the built-in alarm clock</li>
</ul><p>and 6 new actions:</p><ul>
<li>Notification about low smartphone memory</li>
<li>Notification about necessary clean-up</li>
<li>Notifications about low battery and charging</li>
<li>Notifications about the presence or absence of mobile networks</li>
<li>Notifications about available free wi-fi networks</li>
<li>Weather forecasts</li>
</ul><p>Each action lasts at least 7 seconds. There will be a total of 10 x 7 = 70 seconds of animation. One second of high-quality digital animation costs about 100 USD. It makes 7.000 USD for one character.</p><p>But we also want to entertain our users and grant them positive emotions by showing funny entertainment scenes that are performed by the characters in their free time. Our project of entertaining animations includes the following actions:</p><ul>
<li>In the morning: waking up, having a shower: 20 seconds</li>
<li>Breakfast and dinner: 20 seconds</li>
<li>Storylines during the day: peeking out from different screen edges, walking and laying on the screen, playing ball, singing songs, reactions when touched with the finger: grumbling, making angry noises, laughing...: 50 seconds</li>
<li>In the evening: yawning and going to bed: 15 seconds</li>
<li>In the night: snoring and sniffing (and being angry when woken up): 20 seconds</li>
</ul><p>It makes about 125 seconds of animation for one character. The approximate animation consts for two characters are: 125 x 100 = 12.500 USD</p><p>But that's not all. All animations need to get a voice-over with cool voices that can be performed only by professional voice-over artists. The cost of their work can vary from 500 to 1000 USD. The duration of our animations is about 150 seconds or 2,5 minutes. If we use the minimum cost, it's 2,5 x 500 USD = 1.250 USD.</p><p>2) Technical development. Android is a very popular system that has spread all over the world. On the one hand it's really great because it means that our app has millions of potential users. But on the other hand it means that each manufacturing company adjusts the Android OS according its requirements. It can add, change or remove any functions and features. As a result it becomes really complicated to develop an app that would operate perfectly on all possible Android devices. Sometimes our developers spend many weeks on a task that appeared to be easy as pie.</p><p>For the estimation of the coding work you can use the average market values for app development (for example on this website: <a href=""http://www.formotus.com/14018/blog-mobility/figuring-the-costs-of-custom-mobile-business-app-development"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.formotus.com/14018/blog-mobility/fig...</a>). The estimated programming works for the new version are about 15.000 USD.</p><p>3) Testing. As we've already mentioned above, the popularity and huge variety of the available Android devices is a big advantage and disadvantage at the same time. We want to ensure that our app works properly on the most popular smartphones and it means that we need to do a lot of testing work on different devices. We also try to react on all user complains who faced any troubles with our app and therefore we need to recreate the operating conditions as exact as possible. Therefore we cooperate with testing laboratories, hire experienced testers and rent different smartphone devices.</p><p>The approximate testing costs for the app (including the work of professional testers and at least 100 test users) are 3.000 USD.</p><p>4) And last but not least the most important thing which is obligatory for each app development process: COFFEE! Being proper app developers, we work a lot in the night because it's the best time to get genius thoughts and bright ideas! And it means that we need coffee. A lot of coffee. Liters of coffee every day!</p><p>We estimate our coffee resources for the whole time of app development at 500 USD.</p><p>If we calculate all the things mentioned above we get the necessary amount of 40.750 USD.</p><p>We hope that our little project was able to attract your attention and we will be glad to cooperate with you! Maybe some of you even become the creators of new cool characters for our app! Also we'll be very happy if you share the information about this campaign with your friends in social networks.</p><p>With warmest greetings,</p><p>your YALOS development team</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469974321/sn236cmzk6kp1ytcjm4z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>","Hello!We are YALOS - a team of young and ambitious app developers and we want to invite you to participate in our new project – an unique Android app 'ADVISOR' that is predestinated to become an indispensable assistant and trustful friend for all smartphone users. But let's start from the very beginning!HOW IT STARTED OR: “BINGO, WE HAVE AN IDEA!”Like most modern people, we became totally addicted to our smartphones and can't imagine our lifes without endless text chats and calls with our friends, relatives, clients and bosses. The smartphone became to usnot only a means of communication but also an alarm clock, planner, calendar, map... to put it simply a live-saving and essential device! And as being a programmer is not a job but a lifestyle it means that we need to be available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. And we noted one thing: you can spend the whole day sitting next to your phone and it keeps absolute silence. But you need only to leave for two minutes to get you a coffee or something else and within this short period of time you'll receive at least five very important calls, ten extraordinary important SMS-messages and two or three reminders about calendar events of exceptional importance! Of course you can grab your smartphone every time when you got distracted for a few minutes to check whether you missed something but sometimes you simply don't think about it – especially if your head is full with a millions of other tasks. Of course the information about the missed call or unread message stays on your device and sooner or later you'll see it. But in some cases even one hour delay can have not very pleasant consequences. For example you can miss an attractive job offer or forget about a school performance of your beloved child simply because you didn't hear the reminder... Besides that, all these standard notification icons and info panels are boring as hell!Anyway, on a nice day somewhere back in the middle of 2015 our idea machine Nick got a cool idea that was caught up by our whole team: why shouldn't we create our own mobile helper – a useful and functional app that reminds the smartphone user about important events in an unusual and funny way? That was the day when our project ADVISOR was born.STAGE 1. WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONEWe started our project from the development of the general concept. We've decided that our 'advisor' should be performed as a funny animated character that moves into the smartphone and starts to inform its owner about different important events. We decided to replace the boring standard phone notifications with funny scenes performed by this character. We also decided to add some purely entertaining scenes where the character makes some funny actions. Our app should operate above all other apps to ensure that the user for sure notices the important information. We also decided to add voice to the character's image so that it can use its voice to notify the user about the important events.After some thoughts we decided to chose the image of a funny dog. Together with our designer we've created a charismatic character: the Dog, and created animated scenes with him. After the app is installed, the Dog settles right in your smartphone. Most of the time you don't see him but if something important happens and Dog needs to remind you about it he appears on the screen on the top of all other running apps. You get the impression that the funny character interacts with you like a real living creature and you'll for sure love his great personality!In the first version of our app that was released in December 2015 we offer only four main notification types:
about missed phone calls
about unread SMS-messages
about calendar events
built-in alarm clock
We also made the interesting feature that if the smartphone is in the silent mode the Dog still reminds about the missed events but his mouth will be closed and he will hold a sign with the actual information.Besides that the user can activate the entertaining feature when the Dog appears on the screen at certain time intervals and displays the funny entertaining scenes. Currently we have four entertaining scenes: reading a newspaper, having dinner, doing some sports exercises and sleeping.All functions of the app can be adjusted according to your personal needs (you can turn on only the necessary types of notification, change the number and frequency of the notification, change the volume level, turn the entertaining scenes on or off etc.)You can take a look at our website http://adviserdog.com/en and get a better impression of our current app or watch the video above.STAGE 2.

</div></div>","The BBP is a networked 3d printer controller board, features everything you need to upgrade your 3d printer. 

www.fastbot3d.com

https://www.facebook.com/FastbotBBP




It is powered by AM335x, 1GHZ Cortex-A8 processor, and contains 5 or 7 stepper motor drivers, 3 heaters, 6 endstops, 6 fans, 1 microSD Card socket, 1 Ethernet socket, and 1 USB socket so you can connect with USB WiFi or camera.






It is Powerful!

The BBP runs on a powerful 32-bit ARM (1GHZ Cortext-A8), and with the help of Programmable Realtime Units inside this chip, it can generate high frequency step signal.

Firmware
We have developed a 3d printer firmware to fully use the PRU. With the help of this firmware, it is easy to generate high frequency step signal, and that is why BBP can make 3d printer faster.


Apart from the advantage of speed, the BBP also makes 3d printer easier to use. 
Remote controlling & monitoring
It is quite mesmerising to watch a 3D printer create an object in front of you but sometimes you don't have the time to check it in real life.
WiFi enabled 3D printing
Connect an USB WiFi dongle to BBP, and it will enable your 3D printer to connect wirelessly to any web enabled device. There is no need for cables anymore and you can start, stop, and monitor your print from anywhere!
The BBP supports OctoPrint for remote controlling & monitoring.





The First Android 3d printer controller
The BBP is running Android System, we use the OctoPrint APK which integrates the 3D viewer and the slicer.

<p> </p>
<h3>Why choose riimo</h3>
<p>· It's the most affordable ($6) and robust universal remote accessory for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.<br/>· Instead of having one remote for every device - or even an oversized universal remote with too many buttons - riimo customers only need to handle an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad (okay, well the iPad's not that small...)<br/>· Unlike other iPhone remote solutions, riimo plugs into the headphone jack, which frees up the 30-pin dock connector for charging while while the remote is in use. riimo users will never be without a remote when device battery is low. Also, iPhone users won't have to flip their phones upside-down to use the remote.<br/>· Robust database of manufacturer-supplied infrared codes for easy Apps set up. <br/>Additionally, only the buttons appropriate to the activity in use (like watch TV, listen to music, watch DVD) appear on the screen.<br/>· riimo users can customize the way they control their equipment with touchscreen buttons, Apple's Multi-Touch gestures, and accelerometer controls. For example swiping two fingers down the screen can reduce volume and flicking the iPhone forward can change the channel.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the riimo doesn’t physically consist of very much. Its little box contains just a riimo ‘dongle’, and a reasonably handy little holder for the dongle that’s attached to a key ring.</p>
<p>The riimo dongle is around an inch long and a mm or so wide, with a 360-degree IR transmitter on one end and a plug for pushing into your iDevice’s headphone slot on the other. The necessary free app for driving the dongle has to be downloaded from Apple App store.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The idea of having a universal remote like the riimo on your iPad/iPhone/iPod touch seems to make perfect sense. After all, long - and frequently frustrating - experience suggests that the best universal remotes are those that feature some sort of screen display to help you keep track of what you’re trying to achieve on which device. And models with touchscreens take the vital sense of control immediacy to a whole new level.</p>
<p>Add to this the riimo’s support for gesture-based controls on its iPod/iPad/iPhone home, as well as the extra-large screen area available on an iPad, and you really could be talking about the universal remote to end all universal remotes.</p>

· It's the most affordable ($6) and robust universal remote accessory for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.· Instead of having one remote for every device - or even an oversized universal remote with too many buttons - riimo customers only need to handle an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad (okay, well the iPad's not that small...)· Unlike other iPhone remote solutions, riimo plugs into the headphone jack, which frees up the 30-pin dock connector for charging while while the remote is in use. riimo users will never be without a remote when device battery is low. Also, iPhone users won't have to flip their phones upside-down to use the remote.· Robust database of manufacturer-supplied infrared codes for easy Apps set up. Additionally, only the buttons appropriate to the activity in use (like watch TV, listen to music, watch DVD) appear on the screen.· riimo users can customize the way they control their equipment with touchscreen buttons, Apple's Multi-Touch gestures, and accelerometer controls. For example swiping two fingers down the screen can reduce volume and flicking the iPhone forward can change the channel.
As its name suggests, the riimo doesn’t physically consist of very much. Its little box contains just a riimo ‘dongle’, and a reasonably handy little holder for the dongle that’s attached to a key ring.
The riimo dongle is around an inch long and a mm or so wide, with a 360-degree IR transmitter on one end and a plug for pushing into your iDevice’s headphone slot on the other. The necessary free app for driving the dongle has to be downloaded from Apple App store.

The Impact

The idea of having a universal remote like the riimo on your iPad/iPhone/iPod touch seems to make perfect sense. After all, long - and frequently frustrating - experience suggests that the best universal remotes are those that feature some sort of screen display to help you keep track of what you’re trying to achieve on which device. And models with touchscreens take the vital sense of control immediacy to a whole new level.
Add to this the riimo’s support for gesture-based controls on its iPod/iPad/iPhone home, as well as the extra-large screen area available on an iPad, and you really could be talking about the universal remote to end all universal remotes.",25.0,1,"4 Campaigns

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Shock Clock Wake Up Trainer is the Next Evolution of the Pavlok Alarm Clock App</h2>
<p>In 2014, we launched an IGG for the Pavlok Device. The Device was designed to help break bad habits, using a mild electric zap.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The campaign was a huge success, and we successfully fulfilled all of the units to our IndieGogo backers in 2015 (how many times has that NOT happened!!).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Shortly after we started shipping we launched a very simple app – the Pavlok Alarm Clock app. It was (and still is) very basic: one alarm, choose your stimulus, and press save. It's not fancy, <b>but holy @#$% is it effective!</b></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FkzjXFQrjQVo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DkzjXFQrjQVo&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FkzjXFQrjQVo%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>This isn't just some crazy idea – we've had hundreds of Pavlok users testing a simple version of the Alarm Clock software to wake up quickly and feel alert every morning, and their stories are inspirational to hear. Here is what just a few Pavlok users had to say about the basic alarm feature:</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">If the Alarm App Works, Then Why An Indiegogo Campaign?</h2>
<p>We started with the Pavlok Alarm, but users wanted much more.</p>
<p>The Alarm is SIMPLE. It only lets you set a single alarm. You snooze it by pressing on the button --- something several users would do subconsciously.</p>
<p><b>So we're back on IndieGogo, developing the features to make this the world's BEST alarm clock.</b></p>

<div>The original Pavlok is $199, includes the alarm clock app, self zap, habit training, and more.</div>
<div>The Shock Clock is $99, and is focused as an Alarm. (No self zap, better sleep tracking, better motion tracking, etc.)</div>

<br/>He has also written four programming books (including an international bestseller), and helped launch numerous New York Times Bestsellers (such as The 4- Hour Chef by Tim Ferriss). </div><div style=""text-align: center;"">Behavioral Technology Group (parent company to Pavlok and now Shock Clock) has grown to include 10 all-star team members specializing in software design, engineering, marketing and customer service.<br/> <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<div>
<p><b>How do I set the Alarm?</b></p>
<p>Via Bluetooth and the included iOS/Android App.</p>
</div> <p><b>Will the alarm still go off if Shock Clock disconnects from my phone in the middle of the night? </b></p>
<p>Yes the alarm will still work because when you press ""save alarm"" in the app it actually saves the information to the Real Time Clock memory in the ShockClock, meaning you don't have to keep your phone connected for the alarm to work. Likewise you'll be able to shut off the alarm without connecting to your phone in the morning – only connect when you need to change one of your alarms.<br/> </p>
<p><b>What is the difference between the $129 Shock Clock that ships at the end of the campaign and the $99 Shock Clock that ships in September?</b></p>
<p>There is no hardware/software difference between the two. We only have a limited number available from our initial production run, so we're offering anyone who is willing to wait for us to replenish stock a lower price. Both will receive the software features at the same time – all features by September.<br/><br/>For those that get the $129 shipping at the end of the campaign they will get the basic alarm app that we have working right now, and they will automatically be enrolled in our ""beta tester"" group and they'll get the most cutting edge versions of the software features as we develop them.</p>
<p><b>The feature that I want the most is a stretch goal. If you don't reach the goal, does that mean it will never get developed? </b></p>
<p>Not necessarily, but it will definitely take us longer. We're hoping that this campaign will be super successful so that we can afford to hire the software engineering talent to develop all of these features quickly &amp; have them work great. The more money we raise, the more features we can commit to by the delivery date in September.<br/><br/><b>How Can I Choose to Be Woken up? </b></p>
<p>The Shock Clock will wake you up with haptic feedback:  beep, vibration or zap.</p>
<p><b>How uncomfortable is the zap?</b></p>
<p>The electrical stimulus is carefully designed so that it is enough to be uncomfortable, but not so strong that it hurts (and nowhere near dangerous – the Shock Clock is CE/FCC certified and 10,000 Pavlok users have proven it is safe and effective). It's a lot like a static shock you get when you touch a doorknob after rubbing your feet on the carpet.</p>
<p><b>What is the Battery Life?</b><br/>The battery life ranges from 3-5 days and charges through micro USB.<br/><br/><b>What Devices are Compatible with the Shock Clock App?</b><br/>Apps support Android 4.3+ iOS 6+</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>General Questions</b></h3>
<br/><b>Is There a Warranty?</b><br/> <p>Yes, we offer a 1-year manufacturer’s warranty against defects.</p> <b>What is The Prospective Delivery Date for the Shock Clock?</b><br/><br/>If you buy the 'Get Shock Clock NOW' perk your Shock Clock will ship once the campaign ends. If you've selected any other package expected delivery is September 2016.<div>

Shortly after we started shipping we launched a very simple app – the Pavlok Alarm Clock app. It was (and still is) very basic: one alarm, choose your stimulus, and press save. It's not fancy, but holy @#$% is it effective!

This isn't just some crazy idea – we've had hundreds of Pavlok users testing a simple version of the Alarm Clock software to wake up quickly and feel alert every morning, and their stories are inspirational to hear. Here is what just a few Pavlok users had to say about the basic alarm feature:
 


  
 
 
If the Alarm App Works, Then Why An Indiegogo Campaign?
We started with the Pavlok Alarm, but users wanted much more.
The Alarm is SIMPLE. It only lets you set a single alarm. You snooze it by pressing on the button --- something several users would do subconsciously.
So we're back on IndieGogo, developing the features to make this the world's BEST alarm clock.
 
 


With your help and support we can add three new features:

Snooze Lock: Pavlok Shock Clock will use motion tracking to know when you’re out of bed and won’t let you cheat.
Accountability: Pavlok Shock Clock will let your friends know if you don't wake up----and if you don't get out of bed, optionally give them the ability to zap you awake. 
Sleep Cycle Analysis: Pavlok Shock Clock will use motion tracking to know when you’re out of bed and won’t let you cheat.



What's the Difference Between The Pavlok and the Shock Clock Wake Up Trainer?

The original Pavlok is $199, includes the alarm clock app, self zap, habit training, and more.
The Shock Clock is $99, and is focused as an Alarm. (No self zap, better sleep tracking, better motion tracking, etc.)
IF WE HIT OUR STRETCH GOAL OF $50,000, WE'LL ENGINEER THE SHOCK CLOCK WAKEUP TRAINER TO BE UPGRADEABLE (as a paid add-on) TO THE FULL PAVLOK (for IndieGogo Supporters). 
This means, you'll be able to upgrade the device to get all of the features of the Pavlok, should you decide to, any time in the future (as a paid upgrade).
 
Here's the Plan For Stretch Goals:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


What Do I Get With The Shock Clock Wake Up Trainer?
 
The Shock Clock comes boxed with the Shock Clock module, a wristband, and a charging cable. Wristbands are available in 5 different colors: pink, black, blue, grey, and red.
 
  
 How Do I Use The Shock Clock Wake Up Trainer? The wristband and module of the Shock Clock are meant to be work to bed at night. You set the alarm from the app (available in Android and iOS) and choose how you want to be woken up. There are three types of wake up options:

Beep
Vibrate
Zap (mild electric stimulus)

       

 
When the alarm goes off, the Shock Clock will alert you to wake up using the stimulus you selected. We recommend starting with a beep or vibration to wake up, with a Zap if you don't get up with the beep or vibrate. How Do I Turn Off The Alarm? 
With Snooze Lock off, You can snooze/turn off the alarm from within the app, or you can short press (snooze) or long press (disable alarm) on the lighting bolt of the Shock Clock module. 
 
  
 With Snooze Lock on, the device will require that you stand up and walk around. If you try to go back to sleep? Well...ZAP.  
Campaign Timeline
  
 
 
Will the Shock Clock Wake Up Trainer Help Me Get To Sleep Earlier?Dozens of our users tell the same story --- the act of using the ShockClock makes them become morning people. They naturally begin to fall asleep earlier in the evening, converting them from night owls to morning people.  
Why We Aren't Like Other IndieGogo Campaigns (hint: you'll actually receive your product on time)Unlike other projects we have a proven product and we have a proven team. We have built devices before, and we have already engineered this tech. With IndieGogo's support, we'll build the SOFTWARE to make this device the best alarm clock ever. The Team Behind Pavlok Shock Clock Wake Up Trainer
 
The Pavlok TeamFounder Maneesh Sethi has a solid track record as an entrepreneur: he ran the website Hack the System and invented the ""big brother"" of Shock Clock, the Pavlok which successfully raised over $280,000 in 2014 on Indiegogo, and now has been shipped to over 10,000 people globally.
He has also written four programming books (including an international bestseller), and helped launch numerous New York Times Bestsellers (such as The 4- Hour Chef by Tim Ferriss). Behavioral Technology Group (parent company to Pavlok and now Shock Clock) has grown to include 10 all-star team members specializing in software design, engineering, marketing and customer service. Frequently Asked Questions

How do I set the Alarm?
Via Bluetooth and the included iOS/Android App.
 Will the alarm still go off if Shock Clock disconnects from my phone in the middle of the night? 
Yes the alarm will still work because when you press ""save alarm"" in the app it actually saves the information to the Real Time Clock memory in the ShockClock, meaning you don't have to keep your phone connected for the alarm to work. Likewise you'll be able to shut off the alarm without connecting to your phone in the morning – only connect when you need to change one of your alarms. 
What is the difference between the $129 Shock Clock that ships at the end of the campaign and the $99 Shock Clock that ships in September?
There is no hardware/software difference between the two. We only have a limited number available from our initial production run, so we're offering anyone who is willing to wait for us to replenish stock a lower price. Both will receive the software features at the same time – all features by September.For those that get the $129 shipping at the end of the campaign they will get the basic alarm app that we have working right now, and they will automatically be enrolled in our ""beta tester"" group and they'll get the most cutting edge versions of the software features as we develop them.
The feature that I want the most is a stretch goal. If you don't reach the goal, does that mean it will never get developed? 
Not necessarily, but it will definitely take us longer. We're hoping that this campaign will be super successful so that we can afford to hire the software engineering talent to develop all of these features quickly & have them work great. The more money we raise, the more features we can commit to by the delivery date in September.How Can I Choose to Be Woken up? 
The Shock Clock will wake you up with haptic feedback:  beep, vibration or zap.
How uncomfortable is the zap?
The electrical stimulus is carefully designed so that it is enough to be uncomfortable, but not so strong that it hurts (and nowhere near dangerous – the Shock Clock is CE/FCC certified and 10,000 Pavlok users have proven it is safe and effective). It's a lot like a static shock you get when you touch a doorknob after rubbing your feet on the carpet.
What is the Battery Life?The battery life ranges from 3-5 days and charges through micro USB.What Devices are Compatible with the Shock Clock App?Apps support Android 4.3+ iOS 6+
 
General Questions
Is There a Warranty? Yes, we offer a 1-year manufacturer’s warranty against defects. What is The Prospective Delivery Date for the Shock Clock?If you buy the 'Get Shock Clock NOW' perk your Shock Clock will ship once the campaign ends. If you've selected any other package expected delivery is September 2016.

<p>The short explanation for why we deliver 4X the resolution is all because of the optics. On conventional VR, the content is splitted in two,  one picture for each eye. So, even a smartphone with a resolution of 1920x 1080, will only provide 960x 1080. But then the aspect ratio is completely off. In order to keep the aspect ratio (usually 16:9 for most 2D-content), the image has to be shrunk (as shown below to the left) to ~960x540, which turns into 1/4 of the smartphones original resolution. With MovieMask however, we're able to give you the full resolution (picture to the right). </p>

What's your secret? So your lenses are special? show me! So what does that have to say for me?It means you get 4 times the resolution as on a standard mobile VR, and can enjoy any content from any app!
The short explanation for why we deliver 4X the resolution is all because of the optics. On conventional VR, the content is splitted in two,  one picture for each eye. So, even a smartphone with a resolution of 1920x 1080, will only provide 960x 1080. But then the aspect ratio is completely off. In order to keep the aspect ratio (usually 16:9 for most 2D-content), the image has to be shrunk (as shown below to the left) to ~960x540, which turns into 1/4 of the smartphones original resolution. With MovieMask however, we're able to give you the full resolution (picture to the right). 

 
The MovieMask Premium rocks (!)
For the Movie lovers out there, you're going to be best pals with the design winning and super comfortable MovieMask Premium.

 And we have delivered over 10.000 MovieMasks to date!Since we started our journey, we have delivered over 10.000 MovieMasks to all the movie-lovers out there, and we now have goods in our warehouse ready to be shipped to you!Here's our CTO Harald, with a lot of MovieMask cartons ready for shippingYou have my interest, what's your story?We got the idea for the MovieMask in January 2016, and founded the company in May. In September 2016, we launched a crowdfunding campaign for our first product, ""MovieMask 1.0"", which got funded by nearly 300% and shipped to over 30 countries across all continents. We delivered the products two months later. Shortly after, we got into the premium reseller of Apple products in Norway, Eplehuset, as well as the biggest telecom provider, Telenor. The last year we've been featured in over 100 Norwegian stores, and we have captured 2,7 % of the Norwegian VR market.MovieMask 1.0 (old) in the stores of Eplehuset, Apples premium reseller in NorwayOk, sounds promising. So what's new?We believe MovieMask delivers an immersive cinema experience, but we knew that we would have several areas of improvement after our first try (even with 30+ prototypes made pre-launch). The first versions sold over 3000 units, which gave us some fantastic feedback on improvement suggestions! It would have been impossible to make the new MovieMask without them, and their key suggestions were:
Improved the optics
Made it adjustable
Made it compatible with glasses

<p>Batteries are something that’s needed for use in small devices whether it be in the home or office. Disposing of standard batteries is an increasing problem because although their uses are various and many, disposing of them is not healthy to the environment. Lightors resolves these issues from a different perspective in providing an easy-to-use alternative. Now, not all batteries are created equal.</p>
<p><b>Lightors are extremely convenient batteries for use whenever and wherever.</b></p>
<p>Unlike other rechargeable batteries, you don’t need an additional charger to house the batteries while charging. Micro-USB cables are the standard when it comes to charging most smart devices today, which makes it much more convenient than having to keep track of an external charging cradle.</p>
<p>Lightors could help potentially reduce battery waste<b> from 10 billion to<br/>20 million annually</b>!</p>
<p><b>Detox the earth, Innovative battery 'LIGHTORS'</b></p>
<p>The Environmental News Network reports that annual global consumption of batteries is at a staggering 10 billion (the US makes up 3 million alone).<br/>Of the total number of batteries consumed, approximately only 2% (200,000) get properly disposed of for recycling while the remaining 9.8 billion are simply thrown out thus contaminating the environment further.<br/>Lightors is an eco-friendly and innovative product that protects the planet by reducing discarded battery waste by 1/500 (from 10 billion to 20 million). Regularly disposed batteries can bring tremendous harm to the environment. </p>

The very name, Quick reply indicates that it enables us to reply quickly to a text message in a few easy steps, no matter what we are doing on our phone. 







Functionality
As we have already stated, the main
characteristic of Quick Reply app is to shorten the time we need to reply to a
text message. However, its main function is to ensure smooth operation on the
phone after texting. 



Just imagine that you can just swipe down and quick-reply,
without ever leaving the app, and then return to whatever you were doing …
checking emails, using Twitter, Facebook… 








Additional options also include 




Design

We followed the instructions of the new Google material design and came up with a solution.




We also had in mind those who want to adjust the design to their own preference, which is basically the beauty of Android. Customization.


Quick Reply Store
Selling themes in the Quick Reply Store will enable us to continue developing our app.



Post / upload your theme and earn money.

How?
It is quite simple. Each user who downloads Quick Reply has the possibility to post themes in the Quick Reply Store, and to earn money from sales of that theme. 
How much can one earn? 
80% of the profit would go to the user, whereas Quick Reply would keep 20% as the maintenance cost (software developer, designers, servers..)



Why We Need You

This is where we need your support. We ‘ve chosen
this way of financing in order to collect the money for realization as quickly
as possible. This way of financing turns the idea of QuickReply into reality
and what is most important it stays free in the Google play store. All together, we can make this happen.
_____________________________________________________________________________

Update:We received a lot of questions about the costs and my explanation wasn't that clear. Sorry for this. A part of the money, i.e.one half is going to programmers, designers and servers that would store our themes. The other half would be used for maintenance for the year to come. This all costs quite a bit. If I had all of these skills, I wouldn't need your help to make this app. I just have an idea, like most of you.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>About The New Alexandrian Library Project and The Assembly of the Sacred Wheel</h3>
<p>The New Alexandrian Library (NAL) will be a resource for those that believe in true freedom and equality for religious studies - a resource that includes all of the esoteric and non-mainstream (but growing!) religions - not just the the usual 3 or 4.  The NAL will make as much content (literature, periodicals, art...) available via the web the greates extent allowed by copyright law, etc.  - so it can be a true resource for ALL of those that can benefit from such a resource!</p>
<p>We are the Assembly of the Sacred Wheel, a legally recognized Wiccan non-profit religious organization based in the Mid-Atlantic region. The form of Wicca that the Assembly practices is syncretic and draws inspiration from Astrology, Qabala, the Western Magickal Tradition and the folk religions of Europe. Keepers of the Holly Chalice, the founding coven of the Assembly began its life in February of 1984. The Assembly was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1993 and was granted 501(c)(3) status by the IRS in 1995.</p>
<p>We are a responsible and respected esoteric religion with a history of taking on and succedding with large projects.  Check us out at <a href=""http://www.sacredwheel.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sacredwheel.org</a></p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; How We Would Like To Thank You For Your Support</h3>
<p>The total project construction cost is around $175,000 for the first phase.  To date, the Assembly of the Sacred Wheel (ASW) has raised $46,687 in direct donations (80% of that from ASW members.  We put our own money where our mouth is!) and $96,000 from fundraisers over the last 10 years. The land was donated by ASW members and is not counted in these figures.</p>
<h3>Urgent Help Needed Now</h3>
<p>We need a total of an additional $50,000 in the next 5 months, BUT RIGHT NOW, we are asking for immediate funds to cover the next construction payment of $10,000 by January 1st, 2013. That means a deadline for this campaign of December 8, 2012 to let the funds clear.</p>
<p>And while we know you know this project is worthy of support all on its own, we have produced several products over the years to help fundraising and we would like to send you a selection fo them to say 'Thank You!"" for your support.  See the Perks!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The NAL will serve to support and advance serious academic study for new, non-mainstream, esoteric, 'living' religions that are most likely to be the guiding forces in guiding the Earth and Humans back to health and evolution of Spirit in the coming century. </p>
<p>Like the original Great Library of Alexandria, the schools of Qabala in medieval Spain, and the flourishing of magick that occurred in renaissance Italy, the diverse confluence of minds and resources would result in great leaps forward in theory and practice. The NAL will be one of the cornerstones (of many created by various groups across the globe we hope!) of a new magickal renaissance. The benefits of this growing network for future generations will be incalculable.</p>
<p>The content of the library will also be made available via internet to the greatest extent possible (respecting copyrights, etc.) to be a resource for the entire esoteric community.  The facility will evolve to meet accreditation criteria and serve as the library of record for formal esoteric religion studies at a variety of institutes of higher education.</p>
<p>The NAL will be located on 100 acres of Sacred Land at Seelie Court  - a third of which has been donated to the NAL project - in Georgetown, DE.  The facility will be accessible to visiting scholars and is serviced by Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. airports - while maintaining a wonderfully secluded atmosphere for serious study.</p>

The cloud—storage and computing—describes the increasing ability to access data and apps not from a single computer but the network itself. Meanwhile, the future of the Internet mashes all these concepts together, such that the<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxssA_EEIQ4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> interconnection of wireless devices eventually becomes the cloud</a>. <b><i>This is where iVi comes in, as a first-generation device that provides a personal wireless cloud, by meshing with other iVi and peripheral wireless devices. </i></b>

<p>Most people, when they think of the ""cloud"", think of IT giants and their armies of servers. Massive banks of computers serving the Web. Giving netizens instant access to endless storage and sophisticated software no matter where they are... well.. as long as they're on a stable and fast line in the realm of the Net. There are as many clouds as there are giants: Amazon, Google, Apple... cumulus. Surprisingly, though, the cloud is a concept that goes beyond the Internet. What the cloud defines is the access of data from any node of a network, whether that network be online or offline. </p><p>Although having the ability to access the online world, iVi can ""cloud"" in two new ways. Both offline. First, it is a personal cloud in that it makes wireless connections with all your compliant devices to share and stream data over this private network. Second, iVi units can mesh together to form offline networks. On this public network, data can be accessed and shared using a file-sharing system called BitTorrent. More, apps can reach across this offline network. Apps to chat, message board, stream and such. iVi operates on open-source code, so apps are only limited by the imagination and ingenuity of the community to create. </p><p><b><i>""Basically, iVi gives you a new cloud, and its all yours. And this cloud is seamless by being wireless, private by being offline, and portable by being a mobile device. All of this so you can enjoy a new level of digital integration."" </i></b></p><h4>Just a few things iVi can do:</h4><p></p><ul>
<li>Share that new cool file with your friends all at the same time.</li>
<li>Watch a movie streamed to each of the family's tabs, in a tent, camping.</li>
<li>Driving in your car, your iVi mesh picks up and plays outside mp3 collections.</li>
<li>Share files anonymously at home then do it again at work or school. </li>
<li>Play that favorite video on all the displays in a room.</li>
<li>Stream an educational video to every UPnP device in a classroom of students.<br/>
</li>
<li>Network computers and devices with an offline connection that speeds.</li>
<li>Build a offline, off-grid meshnet for a neighborhood, university, town, city or country.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h3><b>iVi is small, powerful and mobile</b></h3>

It enables seamless, on-demand media browsing and streaming between all your digital devices, in HD.</p><h4>Where could you use iVi?</h4><p></p><ul>
<li>Keep iVi in your home as an all-round media server for all your wireless devices.</li>
<li>Use iVi in your business offline, portable and private data storage and sharing. </li>
<li>Install iVi in your car as a permanent wireless entertainment gateway to on-board sound and displays.<br/>
</li>
<li>Put iVi in your restaurant or coffee shop as a media library for customers.</li>
<li>Libraries would love iVi for more than one reason.</li>
<li>Teachers might want to stream presentations, images and video clips to student devices and fast-track interactive education.</li>
<li>Artists and designers could use iVi to showcase their digital portfolio.</li>
<li>Setup a mesh network as a low-cost alternative to the Internet or where the Net has been incapacitated or is just plain absent.</li>
<li>Take iVi traveling and see what you can mesh with.</li>
<li>Use iVi in a lab to transfer large files wirelessly between workstations.</li>
<li>Employees each having an iVi could share data privately offline whenever they cross paths. </li>

<h3>Key Concepts:</h3><div>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Personal Cloud:</b> Share or stream stored medial to devices.
From iVi, play a movie on your mobile, smart-TV and tab at the same time. Use
one device to wirelessly interact with another via iVi. Use your mobile to
control your smart-TV through iVi. Connect either by direct wireless and/or
UPnP/DLNA.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Collaborative Cloud:</b> Assemble shared cloud space by linking
to other iVi. Cloud space grows collectively with each iVi. Access files easily
and quickly on iVi, which operates on a BitTorrent system using a built-in,
real-time-updated, tracker.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Long-ranged:</b> 1 kilometer beyond, iVi-to-iVi wireless
networks connect. Extended broadcast range due to case-embedded,
state-of-the-art fractal, Koch antennas.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Cone of Silence:</b>  iVi-to-iVi connectivity operates on Layer 2 protocol, without the use of traceable IP addresses. iVi mesh together through a process akin to that found in socialVPN systems providing privacy and security.</li>
<li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Scalable:</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> A single iVi functions as a media server, a few iVi meshed function as a small-world network for a neighborhood, business or university, 10 iVi meshed covers communication and data sharing needs for a small town. Unit-by-unit, build the network you need. Offline and offgrid, if needs be.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Nimble:</b> Data transfer rates starting at 150 MB/s. Implements
the new Intel® Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapter.</li>
<li>
<b>Flexible: </b>A 5000mAh Li-poly battery allows for one-hour of
continual operation (the battery in standby/off keeps its charge for months). Giving iVi portability and a secondary use as a recharging
station for other devices. iVi is recharged through the single microUSB port.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Versatile:</b> Four USB ports, 3 allow for peripheral device
interaction, including but not limited to storage capacity, signal modification
and power-charging options, while the fourth is for special programming. iVi comes with a 32GB microUSB thumb drive. The
Ethernet port allows iVi to operate as a hard-linked wireless router. But iVi
can also act as a wireless hotspot when connected to a wireless broadband
connection. iVi grows into multiple uses.</li>
<li>
<b>Extendible:</b> iVi connected to wired-broadband through the
Ethernet port is able to share a user-controlled portion of bandwidth through the
iVi meshnet, allowing for connected devices to connect to the traditional
Internet. Further, iVi uses miniDLNA to communicate with Private Networks, such
as those used with Xbox ad Play-Station.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Decentralized: </b>Create small-world networks, or mesh networks
by linking any number of iVi together to build your own Public or Private
networks for communication and information transfer. Network capabilities grow
in relation to local iVi density in a region.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Community-driven: </b>Crowdfunding market entry to demonstrate
iVi dedication to the community. iVi has been built from open-source
inventiveness, such as implementing Linux/openWRT and BitTorrent in its design.
Openness will remain a strong focus for iVi.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Neutral: </b>The original vision of the Internet was a public
forum to share ideas without bias or selectivity. With the failure of Net
Neutrality, content selectivity and bias become issues. iVi returns to those neutral roots.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Free: </b>iVi is affordable at CAD $99 per unit with a small, one-time service fee if a group of iVi are required to be pre-meshed.
However, a user with basic IT skills could do this on their own following the
published guidelines. There will be NO further fees beyond this, including no
network service fees.<br/>

<p><b>(1) What exactly is a meshnet and how does iVi create them?</b></p>
<p>A <i>mesh</i> describes an interlaced structure, while a <i>net</i>, or network, describes the inter-connectivity of things. Mesh nets may be wired or wireless, but in the case of iVi, <i>meshnet</i> refers to a wireless mesh net (WMN).</p>
<p>The interlaced connections of a <i>meshnet</i> are wireless access points (WAP) distributed over a location. Each of these wireless points in the meshnet acts as both a host and client. Data sent from one iVi is forwarded across the network until it reaches the destined iVi. The data follows the shortest route, which may change over time. In this way, the meshnet is decentralized, simplified and flexible. Further reading on the subject can be found <a href=""http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/wireless-mesh-network"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reported in Wikipedia on the subject</a>, due to advances in radio technology that has brought down cost, size and power requirements, <i>mesh nodes</i> are able to contain multiple radios for increased modularity, and greater application.</p>
<p>In this way <b>iVi</b>, using B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced routing and an Intel 7260 as the radio, allows multiple iVi nodes to relay traffic seamlessly and securely. Additionally, the USB data pins are connected to a <a href=""http://www.kean.com.au/oshw/WR703N/GL850G%20USB%20Hub%201.07.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GL850G USB hub Integrated Circuit (IC)</a> running at 12MHz. The whole system is supported by the base software, an open, Linux-based routing platform called openWRT.</p>
<p>For info on Intel 7260, read <a href=""http://ark.intel.com/products/75439/Intel-Dual-Band-Wireless-AC-7260?q=7260"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/next-gen-80211ac-wifi-for-dummies.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this</a>.</p>
<p><b>(2) Is there hardware interface for video?</b></p>
<p>There is <b>no hardware interface</b>. Rather, the video process is hardware implementation that interfaces using web streaming.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.openhacks.com/uploadsproductos/ar9331_datasheet.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AR9331</a><a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a> (integrated router/processor) off-loads the video processing to BCM70015. The processed video data is then streamed by AR9331 to a UPnP/DLNA device for play-back using a web interface. This pairing of chips has been done because although AR9331 is fast for routing, when used for video streaming it has insufficient processing power to translate files formats.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.habeyusa.com/datasheet/BCM70015.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">According the the chip manufacturer</a>, BCM70015 ""is the industry's lowest cost, lowest power, highly integrated media processing solution for high definition (HD) video 
playback applications."" It's applications include streaming video over IP.</p><p><b>(3) Would iVi enable me to ditch my web hosting company and have a local server running PHP/MySQL (or whatever else I want)?</b><br/></p><p>The answer to your query: most likely. It really depends on how many users you have. 10,000 hits on your webpage a month or less, iVi could handle (<a href=""http://www.frogloop.com/care2blog/2011/5/24/how-much-traffic-should-your-website-generate.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most webpages get around 3000</a>). Unless you're talking about a social networking or commerce site. But blogs or personal pages - no problem. </p><p>So the real answer is basically, yes. iVi can run PHP/MySQL. iVi runs on openWRT, so here are <a href=""http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/lamp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">some notes on this type of system</a>.<br/></p><p><b>(4) What's the difference between iVi &amp; MR3040?</b></p><p></p><p>So the differences between iVi and the <a href=""http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/?model=TL-MR3040"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TL-MR3040</a>:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>iVi includes Intel 7260ac.</li>
<li>iVi has a 4 port USB hub (two ports are used one for the BCM70015 video processor, and the other for the Intel 7260).</li>
<li>Of the 4 ports, two ports can be used for charging external devices via USB or interacting with peripheral devices like USB hard drives, USB solar panels and charging packs and so on.</li>
<li>iVi has a serial connection via the micro-USB charge port.</li>
<li>iVi also has a 5000mA/h Li-poly battery. </li>
<li>iVi is also has 5G.<br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p><p>MR3040 has one USB port, no serial interface for development and half the battery power.</p><p><b>(5) I have never used any cloud services because it really freaks me out. The idea of uploading my personal info to the Internet. ""Yes"", they say it's secure, but what is really “SECURE” these days?</b></p><p>We loved the idea of security. The Product Realization Centre team used Dropbox, Box, and others cloud-based service. But we're concerned that our data could be misused. Our team is spread all over Canada and the world so security is always an issue. Bypassing security issues is one of the creative forces behind iVi.</p><p><b>(6) I see this is a flexible funding campaign. Does that mean you have the means to produce ALL the units ""ordered"" through this campaign even if you don't meet your goal?</b></p><p>When this campaign started we needed $32K CAD to complete it. However, early into the launch of the campaign, we received outside funding: such that the full build/run has been funded. This is why we changed the goal to $6K CAD.  Because, even if we don't reach the 6K goal, we will still be making a full build run and fill all the orders.<br/></p><p></p><p><b>(7) <b>Why not also make this an Open Source Hardware project? </b></b></p><p>The iVi project will be <i><b>open source hardware</b></i>, once it matures a bit. Lots of work still to do. </p><p>Some projects use indiegogo late in the game: basically as a marketing and sales platform for a product that has been finished. While others use IGG to fund an idea that has no substance so it may gain form and function, However, iVi is middle-of-the-road. We have a couple of prototypes. But changes are still occurring to hardware for the final version. Mostly in response to concerns and requests from the community but partially from sparks of improvement from team discussions. Since the dawn of the campaign, the iVi design has been amended to included additional components, the BCM70015 and a hardware-based RNG, to increase optimal functionality for iVi users. </p><p>That being said, iVi has begun to engage the open source hardware community. We tried to engage the meshnet and torrent communities on reddit, and though we encountered some interest and support quite some of that community cried doubt, scam and fraud. So it occurs when new dogs enter an old arena. Pissing contests. Time we'd rather spend on getting iVi the best it can be, instead of defeating trolls on bridges.  Additionally, we have engaged the PirateBox community. <a href=""http://forum.piratebox.cc/read.php?2,13053"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here</a>, you can see the basic blocks, though we haven't completed the changes to the PCB yet.<br/></p><p>As to <b><i>open source software </i></b>on GitHub. Yup, that's coming too. We're coding away and will release it in a month or so. So coders and hackers can play.</p><p><b>(8) <b>Will it be possible to install systems like ownCloud, ArkOS and Sandstorm on the iVi?</b></b></p><p></p><p>We are not sure about ArkOS, but Sandstorm there is a strong possibility since the Linux kernel running on iVi is 3.7.9 and Sandstorm requires at least 3.1.3.</p><p>ownCloud is based on ARM and AR9331 is based on MIPS. So we are not sure if it can be ported or not.</p><p><b>(9) Can the iVi be used as a VPN for secure internet browsing?</b></p><p>Absolutely, YES. We used an early version of iVi as an openVPN client and with a little configuration iVi can also be used as an openVPN server.</p>
<b><i>Feel free to ask more questions.</i></b></div>","iVi. For you?If you have any of these desires, then iVi is for you.
You want to share media wirelessly to multiple devices in a snap
You want to be anonymous when downloading files
You want to stream data publicly and quickly  
You want to communicate offline
You want a new internet














The wired-world of the Internet has been rapidly evolving... and growing ephemeral wings. Long gone are the days when networked connectivity is done sitting anchored in place locked to a screen. Connectivity has become wireless and mobile, flexible and multi-functional—free to work and play. The realm of the coffee-shop not the cubicle.Rising on the edge of this tide of change comes increased complexity. New wireless and smart devices spring up daily. Such that now they outnumber us. All are able to connect, one way or another. However, there remains a missing element. We lack an easy, mobile, cross-functional way to network everything together. Enter iVi, an easy-to-use, go-anywhere device hub, to connect all that cool stuff together.The Digital Age, dominated by information, is edging out and leading into the Synergy Age. A time when everyone and everything connects, sufficiently. When able to connect more easily and reliably, new opportunities develop. The current term, Internet of Things, describes a connected world full of benefits. iVi—in its most basic form—a portable micro-server connects all those Things, anywhere and everywhere.
Evidence is apparent that networking trends often gain valuable weight. Take the make-it-or-break-it importance that social media networking now wields. Where once it was purely for entertainment—kitty videos and bloopers—now these sites, including YouTube and Twitter, are arenas that big business and academia must enter or be left behind. How we network evolves. Ideas spark trends that eventually become mainstream. New systems, new applications, new opportunities. iVi provides another way to network—the meshnet.""Meshnet"" describes a network topology where all nodes are equal, working together to distribute data across the entire network. A robust, decentralized network where nodes can be eliminated but the mesh survives. Mostly utilized as a military technology, still communities form to cast out meshnets. Hyperboria, a virtual meshnet, operates through the Internet via cjdns encrypted nodes. Techielitist activist groups, the Meshnet Project and The Darknet Plan, exist alongside in commonality. Public meshnet ventures, however, are not as common. The most successful being Guifi.net in Catalonia with over 25,000 working nodes. Locally, initiatives seed a meshnet and piece-by-piece the mesh spreads ending eventually at a globalized, neutral entity. Herein lies the purpose of iVi: to provide an easy-to-use meshnet option to fill-in the gaps faster—but more so—to make meshnet technology accessible to everyone, not just the technical elite.  Though immature and scattered, meshnets have immediate application. Already, they've been used in emergency response experiments and as low-cost network alternatives. When disaster strikes, either natural or political, meshnets have provided a method to connect independent of the often biased, centralized Net. Tech writers from big titles discuss the mesh. At times, weighing the pros and cons, but more recently giving convincing argument for the implementation of the meshnet. No matter what, the meshnet is here to stay. But what does iVi brings to the meshnet model? iVi is a wireless mesh device that is portable, affordable, but also scalable. A single iVi acts as a wireless media sever, while multiple iVi go on to create meshnets.Some may argue that the Internet, as the established foundation, is what we must build onto to further inter-connectivity infrastructure. That devices like iVi, that create independent networks, are out-of-this-world. Experts beg to differ. The think tank, Institute for the Future, is calling for ideas to #reinventthenet and so look towards a Second Curve Internet as a way to redesign a way from a broken Internet. iVi is versatile. It can link to and share the traditional Internet, but more importantly, iVi gives us a new design: an adaptable and safe way to connect.


Reasons why experts doubt the future of the old Internet reside alongside issues such as the failure of Net Neutrality, post-Snowden privacy concerns, aging infrastructure, ISPs modifying traffic content, growing bandwidth costs and caps and fragility concerns effected by nature and institutions. Rising criticism of current Net architecture stems even from Neticons. Father of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee, calls for a Magna Carta for the Web. While, Jaron Lanier, VR pioneer and author of Who Owns the Future?, questions the model of the ""Siren Server"". Basically, its a mess. Just as electric cars like Telsa Model S give viable alternatives to fossil-fuel-bred vehicles, iVi gives an alternative to an elderly information superhighway that continues to wait for the dark-fiber promise of Internet2.  The dream of a wireless world goes back far. In the 1900s, Nikola Tesla spoke often of his ""World-system"" of wireless transmission. However, the version of the Internet in operation is rooted more in the ""Galactic Network"" envisioned by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT, first head of DARPA. But, these two impressions now meld present day and receive further influence from the ""cloud"" concept brought to us in the 90s. The cloud—storage and computing—describes the increasing ability to access data and apps not from a single computer but the network itself. Meanwhile, the future of the Internet mashes all these concepts together, such that the interconnection of wireless devices eventually becomes the cloud. This is where iVi comes in, as a first-generation device that provides a personal wireless cloud, by meshing with other iVi and peripheral wireless devices. 

iVi connects everything

Most people, when they think of the ""cloud"", think of IT giants and their armies of servers. Massive banks of computers serving the Web. Giving netizens instant access to endless storage and sophisticated software no matter where they are... well.. as long as they're on a stable and fast line in the realm of the Net. There are as many clouds as there are giants: Amazon, Google, Apple... cumulus. Surprisingly, though, the cloud is a concept that goes beyond the Internet. What the cloud defines is the access of data from any node of a network, whether that network be online or offline. Although having the ability to access the online world, iVi can ""cloud"" in two new ways. Both offline. First, it is a personal cloud in that it makes wireless connections with all your compliant devices to share and stream data over this private network. Second, iVi units can mesh together to form offline networks. On this public network, data can be accessed and shared using a file-sharing system called BitTorrent. More, apps can reach across this offline network. Apps to chat, message board, stream and such. iVi operates on open-source code, so apps are only limited by the imagination and ingenuity of the community to create. ""Basically, iVi gives you a new cloud, and its all yours. And this cloud is seamless by being wireless, private by being offline, and portable by being a mobile device. All of this so you can enjoy a new level of digital integration."" Just a few things iVi can do:
Share that new cool file with your friends all at the same time.
Watch a movie streamed to each of the family's tabs, in a tent, camping.
Driving in your car, your iVi mesh picks up and plays outside mp3 collections.
Share files anonymously at home then do it again at work or school. 
Play that favorite video on all the displays in a room.
Stream an educational video to every UPnP device in a classroom of students.

Network computers and devices with an offline connection that speeds.
Build a offline, off-grid meshnet for a neighborhood, university, town, city or country.

iVi is small, powerful and mobile
 With iVi as the nerve center of your personal cloud, you can browse, play, share, store, manage, even edit all your audio, photos, video and documents, from any connected and capable UPnP device. iVi is a small, mobile, wireless, micro-cloud server. It enables seamless, on-demand media browsing and streaming between all your digital devices, in HD.Where could you use iVi?
Keep iVi in your home as an all-round media server for all your wireless devices.
Use iVi in your business offline, portable and private data storage and sharing. 
Install iVi in your car as a permanent wireless entertainment gateway to on-board sound and displays.

Put iVi in your restaurant or coffee shop as a media library for customers.
Libraries would love iVi for more than one reason.
Teachers might want to stream presentations, images and video clips to student devices and fast-track interactive education.
Artists and designers could use iVi to showcase their digital portfolio.
Setup a mesh network as a low-cost alternative to the Internet or where the Net has been incapacitated or is just plain absent.
Take iVi traveling and see what you can mesh with.
Use iVi in a lab to transfer large files wirelessly between workstations.
Employees each having an iVi could share data privately offline whenever they cross paths. 


Mesh Network: iVi supports advanced mesh networks for file-sharing between all units in range (see Koch antenna). Forming large, private networks. Suitable for most wireless devices, including computers, smartphones, laptops, tablets, and PSP/NDS.                              iVi supports two types of meshnet protocols: B.A.T.M.A.N.-adv and                                  cjdns. The first through software. B.A.T.M.A.N-adv runs on a Layer2                                protocol, and eliminates issues associated with NAT from node to                                    node.The second is implemented via hardware (random number                                      generator) to create IPv6 addresses, thereby off-loading the                                              processing from the AR9331 chipset.                                              

Wi-Fi Hotspot: Instantly turn any connection, wired or wireless, into a high-speed Wi-Fi hotspot. iVi supports Wi-Fi repeater functions and includes an Ethernet port for connection to a wired broadband router. 

Cloud Storage: Create your own cloud storage network. Turn a USB storage drive into personal cloud storage for easy file 
access and media streaming via the included Kodi Media Player or iVi’s 
built-in web interface. Add more iVi or additional hard drives to increase storage space without any limit.

Compatibility: iVi has multiple internet connection modes and supports a wide range of formats. Also, iVi streams or transcodes most media types with little or no configuration. iVi is powered by MEncoder, FFmpeg, tsMuxeR, AviSynth, MediaInfo, VLC and more. 

Security: iVi is secure personal micro-cloud. All local connected devices and data are accessible only to local account holders. iVi also encrypts and decrypts files to be shared or stored in the public cloud. iVi supports guest networks on the 2.4GHz band, enabling you to share 
internet access with others without granting them access to your private
 network.

Charge Mobile Devices: iVi runs on its own internal 5000mAh battery, or AC power when using the provided adapter. Smart LEDs display remaining power levels. Three of the USB ports deliver up to one amp of power to charge a peripheral device, and can do this simultaneously when iVi is recharging itself. Furthermore, the                                            internal battery runs 24 hrs on active mode, while standby lasts                                        months without needing a recharge. Notice that then USB solar                                        charger bonus perk makes iVi even more portable.

Game Networks: Create your own private game network with much faster speeds than the internet. Unlimited Folders on PS3 and Xbox.

Share Broadband: 3G, 4G, or LTE wireless broadband connections can be shared with a wireless USB adapter and your cellular service.

Media Streaming: Onboard DLNA media server for streaming music, photos, and video from an attached USB hard drive. iVi also includes the Kodi app, which supports most file formats, including bmp, jpg, and png for photos; mp3, wav, m4a, mp4, mov, and m4v for audio/video.                                                                                                      Live Subtitles on All Devices: If your device does not support a video
 subtitle format, iVi will add it to the video stream automatically for 
viewing. If you don't have subtitles at all, UMS will add them for                                  you 
via the options on your device.

True Motion (Frame Interpolation): iVi smooths video motion for added realism by adding frames to the 
usual 24 or 25fps using InterFrame, an AviSynth plugin with SVP 
libraries.  Automatic Bitrate Adjustment: Automatically changes video bitrate based on your network speed.H.264 Transcoding: On wireless networks H.264 achieves the same quality as MPEG-2, but with much smaller files.Overscan Compensation: On televisions with overscan, iVi compensates to show the whole video. Transcoding is accomplished                              via a BCM70015 BGA device, a low-cost, effective method to offload                                 video processing.
Web Interface: An iVi web interface provides added support for devices without DLNA.Instant Browsing: Browse large file libraries without having to wait for folders to be scanned.


USB & Ethernet Ports:  iVi has three USB ports for connecting and charging drives and peripherals, plus an Ethernet port for connecting to a wired broadband router. iVi recharges away from home by way of an external charging options, such as recharging by our own iViPower LIPO, or by a USB solar panel (check out the perks).

Automatic Plugin Installation: Download and install plugins automatically. 

A full-featured, wireless micro-cloud hub. Lithium-polymer battery-powered and UPnP ready. iVi provides high-security, multi-mode network connectivity in a convenient mobile format. Two USB ports for extra drives or peripherals, AC power and charging, round out this first, truly mobile, micro-cloud server.
iVi is a perfect hub for people, groups, families and organizations 
to defend your information from unauthorized access and manipulation. 
iVi is the ideal way to assure information security across your private 
network.
Manufacturers are investing heavily in wireless technology to satisfy the growing need for mobile networking power. Very soon most enterprises will be enjoying the economic benefits of doing business over an advanced wireless network and providing their organizations with new levels of speed and access to all their media.
iVi is on the the leading edge of the the new secure network revolution and you have the opportunity to participate at the the beginning with this emerging technology.


Key Concepts:



Personal Cloud: Share or stream stored medial to devices.
From iVi, play a movie on your mobile, smart-TV and tab at the same time. Use
one device to wirelessly interact with another via iVi. Use your mobile to
control your smart-TV through iVi. Connect either by direct wireless and/or
UPnP/DLNA.


Collaborative Cloud: Assemble shared cloud space by linking
to other iVi. Cloud space grows collectively with each iVi. Access files easily
and quickly on iVi, which operates on a BitTorrent system using a built-in,
real-time-updated, tracker.


Long-ranged: 1 kilometer beyond, iVi-to-iVi wireless
networks connect. Extended broadcast range due to case-embedded,
state-of-the-art fractal, Koch antennas.


Cone of Silence:  iVi-to-iVi connectivity operates on Layer 2 protocol, without the use of traceable IP addresses. iVi mesh together through a process akin to that found in socialVPN systems providing privacy and security.

Scalable: A single iVi functions as a media server, a few iVi meshed function as a small-world network for a neighborhood, business or university, 10 iVi meshed covers communication and data sharing needs for a small town. Unit-by-unit, build the network you need. Offline and offgrid, if needs be.


Nimble: Data transfer rates starting at 150 MB/s. Implements
the new Intel® Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapter.

Flexible: A 5000mAh Li-poly battery allows for one-hour of
continual operation (the battery in standby/off keeps its charge for months). Giving iVi portability and a secondary use as a recharging
station for other devices. iVi is recharged through the single microUSB port.


Versatile: Four USB ports, 3 allow for peripheral device
interaction, including but not limited to storage capacity, signal modification
and power-charging options, while the fourth is for special programming. iVi comes with a 32GB microUSB thumb drive. The
Ethernet port allows iVi to operate as a hard-linked wireless router. But iVi
can also act as a wireless hotspot when connected to a wireless broadband
connection. iVi grows into multiple uses.

Extendible: iVi connected to wired-broadband through the
Ethernet port is able to share a user-controlled portion of bandwidth through the
iVi meshnet, allowing for connected devices to connect to the traditional
Internet. Further, iVi uses miniDLNA to communicate with Private Networks, such
as those used with Xbox ad Play-Station.


Decentralized: Create small-world networks, or mesh networks
by linking any number of iVi together to build your own Public or Private
networks for communication and information transfer. Network capabilities grow
in relation to local iVi density in a region.


Community-driven: Crowdfunding market entry to demonstrate
iVi dedication to the community. iVi has been built from open-source
inventiveness, such as implementing Linux/openWRT and BitTorrent in its design.
Openness will remain a strong focus for iVi.


Neutral: The original vision of the Internet was a public
forum to share ideas without bias or selectivity. With the failure of Net
Neutrality, content selectivity and bias become issues. iVi returns to those neutral roots.


Free: iVi is affordable at CAD $99 per unit with a small, one-time service fee if a group of iVi are required to be pre-meshed.
However, a user with basic IT skills could do this on their own following the
published guidelines. There will be NO further fees beyond this, including no
network service fees.

FAQ
(1) What exactly is a meshnet and how does iVi create them?
A mesh describes an interlaced structure, while a net, or network, describes the inter-connectivity of things. Mesh nets may be wired or wireless, but in the case of iVi, meshnet refers to a wireless mesh net (WMN).
The interlaced connections of a meshnet are wireless access points (WAP) distributed over a location. Each of these wireless points in the meshnet acts as both a host and client. Data sent from one iVi is forwarded across the network until it reaches the destined iVi. The data follows the shortest route, which may change over time. In this way, the meshnet is decentralized, simplified and flexible. Further reading on the subject can be found here.
As reported in Wikipedia on the subject, due to advances in radio technology that has brought down cost, size and power requirements, mesh nodes are able to contain multiple radios for increased modularity, and greater application.
In this way iVi, using B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced routing and an Intel 7260 as the radio, allows multiple iVi nodes to relay traffic seamlessly and securely. Additionally, the USB data pins are connected to a GL850G USB hub Integrated Circuit (IC) running at 12MHz. The whole system is supported by the base software, an open, Linux-based routing platform called openWRT.
For info on Intel 7260, read this and this.
(2) Is there hardware interface for video?
There is no hardware interface. Rather, the video process is hardware implementation that interfaces using web streaming.
The AR9331 (integrated router/processor) off-loads the video processing to BCM70015. The processed video data is then streamed by AR9331 to a UPnP/DLNA device for play-back using a web interface. This pairing of chips has been done because although AR9331 is fast for routing, when used for video streaming it has insufficient processing power to translate files formats.
According the the chip manufacturer, BCM70015 ""is the industry's lowest cost, lowest power, highly integrated media processing solution for high definition (HD) video 
playback applications."" It's applications include streaming video over IP.(3) Would iVi enable me to ditch my web hosting company and have a local server running PHP/MySQL (or whatever else I want)?The answer to your query: most likely. It really depends on how many users you have. 10,000 hits on your webpage a month or less, iVi could handle (most webpages get around 3000). Unless you're talking about a social networking or commerce site. But blogs or personal pages - no problem. So the real answer is basically, yes. iVi can run PHP/MySQL. iVi runs on openWRT, so here are some notes on this type of system.(4) What's the difference between iVi & MR3040?So the differences between iVi and the TL-MR3040:
iVi includes Intel 7260ac.
iVi has a 4 port USB hub (two ports are used one for the BCM70015 video processor, and the other for the Intel 7260).
Of the 4 ports, two ports can be used for charging external devices via USB or interacting with peripheral devices like USB hard drives, USB solar panels and charging packs and so on.
iVi has a serial connection via the micro-USB charge port.
iVi also has a 5000mA/h Li-poly battery. 
iVi is also has 5G.

MR3040 has one USB port, no serial interface for development and half the battery power.(5) I have never used any cloud services because it really freaks me out. The idea of uploading my personal info to the Internet. ""Yes"", they say it's secure, but what is really “SECURE” these days?We loved the idea of security. The Product Realization Centre team used Dropbox, Box, and others cloud-based service. But we're concerned that our data could be misused. Our team is spread all over Canada and the world so security is always an issue. Bypassing security issues is one of the creative forces behind iVi.(6) I see this is a flexible funding campaign. Does that mean you have the means to produce ALL the units ""ordered"" through this campaign even if you don't meet your goal?When this campaign started we needed $32K CAD to complete it. However, early into the launch of the campaign, we received outside funding: such that the full build/run has been funded. This is why we changed the goal to $6K CAD.  Because, even if we don't reach the 6K goal, we will still be making a full build run and fill all the orders.(7) Why not also make this an Open Source Hardware project? The iVi project will be open source hardware, once it matures a bit. Lots of work still to do. Some projects use indiegogo late in the game: basically as a marketing and sales platform for a product that has been finished. While others use IGG to fund an idea that has no substance so it may gain form and function, However, iVi is middle-of-the-road. We have a couple of prototypes. But changes are still occurring to hardware for the final version. Mostly in response to concerns and requests from the community but partially from sparks of improvement from team discussions. Since the dawn of the campaign, the iVi design has been amended to included additional components, the BCM70015 and a hardware-based RNG, to increase optimal functionality for iVi users. That being said, iVi has begun to engage the open source hardware community. We tried to engage the meshnet and torrent communities on reddit, and though we encountered some interest and support quite some of that community cried doubt, scam and fraud. So it occurs when new dogs enter an old arena. Pissing contests. Time we'd rather spend on getting iVi the best it can be, instead of defeating trolls on bridges.  Additionally, we have engaged the PirateBox community. Here, you can see the basic blocks, though we haven't completed the changes to the PCB yet.As to open source software on GitHub. Yup, that's coming too. We're coding away and will release it in a month or so. So coders and hackers can play.(8) Will it be possible to install systems like ownCloud, ArkOS and Sandstorm on the iVi?We are not sure about ArkOS, but Sandstorm there is a strong possibility since the Linux kernel running on iVi is 3.7.9 and Sandstorm requires at least 3.1.3.ownCloud is based on ARM and AR9331 is based on MIPS. So we are not sure if it can be ported or not.(9) Can the iVi be used as a VPN for secure internet browsing?Absolutely, YES. We used an early version of iVi as an openVPN client and with a little configuration iVi can also be used as an openVPN server.

<h4>Special features: integrated UV sensor<br/>
</h4>
<p>You can use almost every projector with this light curing 3D printer. With many other DLP-based printers on the market, however, you have to do many test with before you can find the exact layer time, since every projector emits a different amount of UV light, that is what cures the resin.<br/></p>

Less time experimenting means less time wasting you precious light–curing resin, and this is isn’t bad, isn’t it?<br/><h4>Special features: flexibility and low-cost design oriented<br/>
</h4>
<p>The LumiFold also has interchangeable building platforms with an engraved grid, so you can also automatically adjust the projection for an accurate and correct size of your 3d printed parts.</p>
<p>Unlike other DLP printers, the LumiFold places the projector over the printer: this lets you use almost every container as resin basin, you don’t need expensive UV-transparent glass or Plexiglas, and you don’t have to apply many coats of anti sticking coating to avoid the container become unusable after a few prints.<br/>For the first tests, we even use small plastic coffee cups! And this was perfect for building small parts and using small amounts of resin, and also keeps the printer costs down.</p>

Come see it on our new Campaign!


Please help us take DIY 3D Printing mobile! Support the first portable, open source photo-initiated polymer resin based 3D printing system!Featured on

You can also check the latest updates on Our Blog or on Our Facebook page, where you 'll be able to follow this project after the campaign.What is the LumiFold?

It is probably the smallest (measuring just 250 x 120 x 30mm when folded) that you can really travel with, and you still have a building area of 90 x 90 x 90mm.This printer is the best choice as your first 3d printer! It’s not expensive, and it one of most easy to use printer on the market.

Note: the electronic board on the side was still the prototype stage, the final version is thinner and has a protective enclosure

How it works
In the current stage, a projector is used to project, layer by layer, thin slices of a 3d object on a moving platform inside a vat containing a light-curing resin.The 3d object is created inside the vat and is then extracted.An overhead unit, with a laser scanning mechanism, is under design and wil remove the necessity of having a projector.The story of the LumiFold

It was first designed when a customer asked for a small, portable 3D printer that he wanted ot use for printing dentals molds. He wanted the printer to be cheap and easy to use too. We started developing the LumiFold, and after some months of designing, building prototypes, going back to design again we came up with the current design of the LumiFold. And it proved to be so good, we decided to launch a crowfounding camping to provide everyone interested a cheap, portable and easy to use 3d printer!



Special Update:

We received many questions about the portability of a system that still needs an external projector. But...
We already had a solution! This accessory was scheduled to launch after the initial campaign, together with the scanner unit. But since we received so many interest on this feature, we are announcing it now:The Overhead Unit
A laser scanning unit that, unlike other similar setup on other 3D printers, uses steppers and mirrors to quickly scan the area with an UV curing laser.Price and availability
The overhead unit is still under testing right now. It will attach to every LumiFold you have already bought, and the price will be half the cost of a good projector. It will be available Q1 2014.
We are adding a new perk: ""The overhead supporter"". You will be able to contribute to the development of the Overhead Unit, and will be one of the first to get it when it will go into production, and you will also get a personal coupon to get 25% off the full price of the Overhead Unit.

More details coming soon...

 We love everything about Apple, so we always get the combo deals they offer, meaning that we own the iPhone and at least one other device such as the Apple Watch, AirPods, an iPad or perhaps all of them. This then gives us a real headache when it comes to working out how to charge everything at once!You probably have a limited number of sockets, which means that you are forced to charge different devices in different places around your house. 
 It can be chaos on your table 
 Some cables are not compatible with your device 
 Apple tried to build a better charging platform before, but they failed, dramatically. 
 So, if you can’t get a good charger from Apple, what do you do? Do a search for “all-in-one wireless charger” and you will find quite a few out there. However, they all have similar problems, 1) they are not reliable, 2) they do not charge all of your devices and 3) they look cheap and plasticky. 
 For all those Apple family users, we decided to create the ultimate 4-in-1 wireless charger, the only charger you will need. 
 
 MFi Certified 4-in-1 Wireless Charger for All Apple Devices & Qi Certification We care about our Apple devices, just like you.  Incorrectly charging your devices can cause long term damage to its battery life. This is why we designed our wireless chargers in a very specific way. The MFi & Qi certification means that all the electronics are designed and specifically tuned for apple devices. This ensures that you are charging in a safe manner, exactly the same as your Apple original charger. 
 
 Drop and Charge Charging has never been so EASY! As the world's first chain-coil wireless charger, both the Air quad and the Air Trio have high-power wireless charging transmitter chain-coils built within the deck zone, which means you can simply drop your Qi-supported device and it starts charging at up to 10W speed. Life is simple, never again do you need to go looking for the charging spot with a so-called wireless charger. 
 Your Life is Free. Don't Be Limited by Devices Charge your Apple Watch any way you like 
 Licensed by Apple, the Apple Watch charging module can either flip up or down with a simple click. This allows you to charge your Apple Watch safely horizontally, or vertically when you use it as a night clock. 18W Super Fast Charging Port Charge your phone up to 50% within 30 minutes Both support 18W fast charging and can charge your phone to up to 50% within 30 mins. Saving you time for the more important things in life instead of waiting for your device to be charged.
 Case Friendly Design Designed with an adjustable controller, the lightning/type c terminal can be adjusted to fit your device charging no matter whether it wears a case on or not. Technology Should Serve Human, LDR Design Ensures Your Nice Sleep  We know you may charge your devices in your bedroom as you go to sleep. With the LDR (light-dependent resistor) sensor, the light goes dark automatically when lights off, so that you can sleep peacefully.  Using Whilst Charging The Air Quad is also equipped with a foldable stand, helping you to charge devices upright. So you can keep an eye on incoming messages, weather alerts, scores or what’s playing on Spotify. You can also use it for hands-free FaceTime calls or for watching live videos on Facebook and Instagram. Space-Saving Foldable Design When there is no need for you to charge the iPad or other devices on the terminal, you can always decide to fold it and save space.
 Living Organized to Be Successful Organize All Your Apple Devices with A Compact Design Being the ultimate 4-in-1 wireless charging station, the Air Quad charges your iPhone, iPad, AirPods and Apple Watch in one small, simple place and keeps them neat and tidy. Say goodbye to messy cables. Never again will you need to look for your charging cables, now you can live organized. 
 Never Settle for Average, We Always Go for Top-Tier Materials. Built with the premium material combo of aramid fiber & chrome-plated zinc. Both the Air Quad and the Air Trio are designed to be luxurious. The precisely cut aramid fiber face provides an unforgettable, luxurious and sexy smooth touch. The zinc alloy frame provides stability and a high degree of accuracy. Both materials are engineered to dissipate heat effectively whilst still giving that high-end appearance.

<p>The next step is to build a prototype with the enclosure and the sliding mechanism. We can't use the Moto MDK since we can't add moving parts. We're in discussions with Motorola to get the key documents and components required -- such as the metal connectors and magnetic parts -- in order to build a real working sample. We're planning to be finished prototyping later this month (March), and we'll share results and progress here on a regular basis! (<strong>Update: We have build our first prototype! Pictures are shown below</strong>)</p>
<p>Then comes the tooling stage. We need your support to fund the best molds and tooling for the enclosure, keyboard, and sliding frame. A sliding keyboard has many more moving parts and is far more complicated than an ordinary ""one piece"" device. We need your financial support to make sure that the product is not compromised.</p>
<p><strong>Update July 2017:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- The tooling is set to be finished by mid-July</strong></p>
<p><strong>- DVT samples estimated to be made in the week of 17th July</strong></p>

<p>When the tooling is finished, we will build testing samples to verify that everything works as it should, and we'll apply for various certifications -- such as FCC, CE, RoHS, and UL -- to provide a safe device that's legal to sell. This also requires your financial support.</p>
<p>Finally we'll use the funds to reserve the essential material and components needed to build quality devices, and get them assembled in one of Foxconn's factories. We will also need your support to pay for the production line and labour, as well as quality control.</p>

It is the most funded project [in Motorola's Transform the Smartphone Challenge], in fact."" -- Motorola Fans, Felipe Berhau""...the accessory that makes me go back to the Moto Z"" -- 9 to 5 Google, Justin Duino""...reminiscent of the old DROID phones... or the old HTC Tilt phones."" -- phonedog, Alex Wagner ""the 'old school' feel of having a personal digital assistant (PDA) again."" -- Android Community, John Hoff""An Indiegogo Moto Mod wants to bring back the physical keyboard in a big way"" -- Digital Trends, Adam Ismail""Oh, snap! It's like the Tilt 3 that never was... I'd rock this."" -- Taylor Martin (@caspertek), writer for CNET Product Introduction The landscape QWERTY physical keyboard disappeared from the smartphone market almost five years ago. No high-end landscape slider has been manufactured since 2012.Many messaging users, tech enthusiasts, hackers, researchers, developers, and IT professionals have been longing for a successor.With the Keyboard Mod, the wait is now over. The Device (Updated with Prototype Images and Video)The Keyboard Mod features a 5-row landscape QWERTY keyboard that slides out and tilts between 0 and 45 degrees. We’re also considering including a battery to extend the phone’s battery life.* With the Keyboard Mod, your Moto Z transforms into a productive mini PC! Keyboard LayoutWe've carefully designed the keyboard layout to maximize productivity and convenience for a variety of users. The Keyboard Mod features:
A separate number row
Larger common keys
Android navigation buttons 
Almost all commonly used symbols
Arrow keys
Custom keys
Shortcuts for different utilities
The non-QWERTY layout will be manufactured after we ship the initial QWERTY layout.For AZERTY, QWERTZ and Scandic Layout users, please refer to the Non-QWERTY layout perks.Update July 2017: Due to the low demand of AZERTY and Scandic layout, only QWERTZ in black will be produced. Keyboard CharacteristicsWe care about the comfort of your typing experience. As such, we designed a keyboard with:
Extra key travel
LED backlight
Curved surfaces
We'll perform a variety of tests under different scenarios to make sure the Keyboard Mod delivers the best typing experience. The individual keys are designed to handle more than 200,000 presses without issues. Sliding MechanismWe're using Teflon™ coating for the sliding track, which ensures a smooth and durable mechanism. The sliding frame is designed to provide 100,000 complete slides during its lifespan.Above is our very first prototype sliding mechanism, with the hinges installed. It will be used in our first demo device.Today, we're working with Motorola to improve the overall structural design. We'll share more details once everything is 100% confirmed.Update: We have already made the first prototype. More pictures attached below.Update 2: We have improved the slider by adding a few more strings on each side.ColoursWe offer 3 colours to match your phone: Black, White and Gold. Black will be the only option for the super early bird perk, and all three colours will be available for the early bird perk. *Don't think 3 colours are enough? We'll have a special edition that will only be available on Indiegogo, and won't be manufactured again - the ""Livermorium Starter Edition""We're aware of the importance of having a physical keyboard on our phones. And so do you. By purchasing the Limited Edition, you'll show your support and own a ""once in a life-time"" product, which will never be available again after this campaign.*If a colour's demand is below the minimum quantity required for manufacturing, a black device will be shipped instead.Update July 2017: Colour option will be only available for QWERTY layout at the moment.  Development Progress and TimelineFor product development, Livermorium teamed up with top-level engineers and designers. You'll find our team details below.So far we've finished the model design and verified all technical aspects. We've also validated the structural design using simulation software, and worked with our component supplier for feasibility analysis. Here are some images of the model design work we've been doing.

Flint has been created to change it and surpass beyond this.</p><p>Over the past years, we have discovered that illumination is a vital element that alters peoples' reality, where human psychology is directly affected by light, shapes created by shadows and color itself. In this respect, we have equipped Flint with features that improve individual's life quality and make their life more interactive...</p><p>Flint is far beyond a simple lighting tool. It can take your couch into the middle of the Amazon forest. It wakes you up in such a way that you've never woken before and its powerful app reflects your notifications all over the room.</p><p>Flint is not just limited to this. Theatre mode synchronises Flint with your screen. The games you play and the movies you watch will now have an additional dimension, closer to reality.</p><p>Safe mode enables Flint to emit an artificial TV light. Thus, even when you're away, Flint creates the impression of life at home which improves your home security. You can activate the safe mode through the app with the remote access feature. Remote access is not only used for activating Safe Mode. You can control Flint and prepare a warm welcome for yourself before arriving home.</p><p>Flint is waterproof and offers a long-lasting battery. This makes Flint an indispensable tool for your outdoor activities. You don’t need internet connection to control Flint. Back-up Bluetooth connection lets you control Flint over Bluetooth when there is no internet connection. Another great way to interact is ""Flint Knob"".

We do not construct such strong relationships with our families and friends, as we have established a strong bond with our smartphone. This phenomena inspired us to create a new medium; “Get Social”. This feature is designed to allow you to have more emotional interaction through the universe of colors. From the app, other users can be easily added to your friend-list. You can send emotions and notifications to your friends, so you can inform them you are at the door.</p><p>With its revolutionary design and software features, Flint blends innovative functionality and compact design without leaving artistic grounds.

<a name=""background"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>As light and color are naturally simple, Flint has been created with a simple and minimalist design in direct proportion to this concept. Despite its simplicity, we have created a smart lighting device with many smart features without compromising ease of use and simplicity.</p>
<p>The human eye can detect millions of colors. Instead of highlighting a color out of millions of colors in the design, black and white contrast is used to form a simplistic and flawless product. While Flint was being designed, the two biggest inspirations were American minimalist sculptor “Tony Smith”, and “Dan Flavin” who uses light as basic tool in his art.</p>
<p>In short, Flint enters into our lives with the philosophy of evolving minimalism from the '60s, blended with today's technology and design concept.</p>

Flint has been created to change it and surpass beyond this.Over the past years, we have discovered that illumination is a vital element that alters peoples' reality, where human psychology is directly affected by light, shapes created by shadows and color itself. In this respect, we have equipped Flint with features that improve individual's life quality and make their life more interactive...Flint is far beyond a simple lighting tool. It can take your couch into the middle of the Amazon forest. It wakes you up in such a way that you've never woken before and its powerful app reflects your notifications all over the room.Flint is not just limited to this. Theatre mode synchronises Flint with your screen. The games you play and the movies you watch will now have an additional dimension, closer to reality.Safe mode enables Flint to emit an artificial TV light. Thus, even when you're away, Flint creates the impression of life at home which improves your home security. You can activate the safe mode through the app with the remote access feature.

BACKGROUND
As light and color are naturally simple, Flint has been created with a simple and minimalist design in direct proportion to this concept. Despite its simplicity, we have created a smart lighting device with many smart features without compromising ease of use and simplicity.
The human eye can detect millions of colors. Instead of highlighting a color out of millions of colors in the design, black and white contrast is used to form a simplistic and flawless product. While Flint was being designed, the two biggest inspirations were American minimalist sculptor “Tony Smith”, and “Dan Flavin” who uses light as basic tool in his art.
In short, Flint enters into our lives with the philosophy of evolving minimalism from the '60s, blended with today's technology and design concept.
