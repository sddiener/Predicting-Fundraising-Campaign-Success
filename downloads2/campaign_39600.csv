<h3>Who are we and what is iGEM?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628065481/dm7yut4fvf0i7ztd87g5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are a group of students from five countries and study in Linköping, Sweden. </p>
<p>This summer, we are working on a non-profit project for the international genetically engineered machines (iGEM) competition, the largest synthetic biology research contest with 300 teams from all over the world. The goal is to solve real-world problems by modifying biological organisms.</p>
<p>Besides the obvious laboratory part, our work also includes Human Practice, where we get in contact with experts in the field and in our case Swedish farmers who experience water shortages. We use the input we receive to further improve our project. </p>
<p>We want to make our project easily understandable for everyone. Therefore, we are also working on the Wiki (our webpage) and the representation of our team on all our social media accounts. Additionally, we create illustrations, videos, and presentations for a better explanation of our project and the problem of water shortage.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is CyaSalt?</h3>
<p>CyaSalt is our solution to the increasing threat of water shortage that all of us are facing. Although our planet provides us with an abundance of water, we can only utilize roughly 1% as fresh water. Many people already suffer from this shortage and with a rapidly growing world population, it is bound to get worse, if nothing changes. Already in 2025, half of us will be living in water-stressed areas. Current desalination technologies are highly energy and resource-consuming, which is why we want to present a more sustainable and environmentally friendly solution.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How do we want to fight the water shortage?</h3>
<p>Cyanobacteria are the ideal organisms to create freshwater because they are able to grow in high salt concentrations (like seawater) and the use of the clean energy source sunlight as their primary energy source makes it a more sustainable option. We want to genetically modify the bacteria to achieve a higher salt uptake.</p>
<p>Our project can be described by what we call the CyaSalt cycle. Starting with the cultivation of the modified cyanobacteria, moving on to the actual desalination process, and then the separation of the cyanobacteria from the desalinated water. The cycle ends with part of the bacterial biomass being used for starting a new cycle, and the rest being used for biofuel production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>An in-depth explanation for science-lovers:</h3>

<p>Our solution is to utilize the photosynthetic and halophilic properties of the cyanobacteria Synechosystis sp. PCC 6803 so that it can successfully desalinate seawater. We will use plasmids that contain the target genes to genetically modify the bacteria ①. After a successful transformation, the bacteria will express the inward-directed chloride pump Halorhodopsin and the cation channel MscL ②. Halorhodopsin is activated by light and creates a chloride influx which leads to a concentration gradient that accelerates the transport of sodium ions through MscL into the cells ③. Now that the salt ions are trapped within the cyanobacteria ④, we have to separate them from the water. To achieve this, we will genetically modify them to express a fusion protein containing a membrane-anchored protein as well as a cellulose-binding domain (CBD) on the outer membrane ⑤. This will allow for easy separation by filtering the water through a cellulose matrix leading to covalent binding of the bacteria to the cellulose ⑥. Optimally, a large part of the accumulating bacterial waste could be used for the production of biofuel.</p>

<p>Although researching is fun and really important it is very costly. The donations we receive will be used mostly for the lab work.

<p><strong>About the Expedition (And me!)</strong></p>
<p>I have been a canoe enthusiast and passionate environmentalist since I was a child. This lust for the outdoors and a sense of urgency to protect our natural resources has guided me through life. Most recently, it has led me to help start up a non-profit, <a href=""http://www.wildriveracademy.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Wild River Academy</a>. <span>Wild River Academy provides canoe expeditions along the Minnesota River. Trips stop along the route to interact with environmental organizations, community members, farmers, and State Park Rangers. This experiential learning opportunity not only enhances outdoor skills, it exposes participants to the social and natural environment in the Minnesota River watershed, encouraging a sense of peace and place.</span> </p>
<p>The trip down the Mississippi is Wild River Academy's most ambitious trip yet. In the fall of 2013, I, along with eight other people, will embark on and film a three month long canoe journey down the Mississippi River from the headwaters in Lake Itasca, Minnesota, to New Orleans. As we paddle, we will engage communities in an ongoing dialogue about their relationships to and interactions with this watertrail to give voice to the Mississippi River, its inhabitants, and the many perspectives we encounter along the way. Upon completion of the trip, we will produce a documentary of this journey so that these vital conversations can continue with others beyond the flow of the river.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Why Paddle the Mississippi?</strong> </h3>
<p>This is a great question. As the climate debate comes to a head in the United States, it’s easy to lose sight of the everyday people whose lives revolve around the health of a natural resource. We think it is vital to not only document what we learn about the river from the perspective of a canoe, but also to listen to and engage with a few of the 18 million people who rely on the Mississippi for drinking water. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<p>So the breakdown is pretty simple.  First and foremost, I need to eat.  I’m asking $720 for all of my food expenses.</p>

<p>$1,000 – A copy of the finished documentary, a photo shout-out, a Paddle For Change t-shirt, your name in the credits of our documentary, a postcard, THE BIGGEST hug, and my eternal gratitude. And I will wish happy things for you for all of my birthday wishes from here on out.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Without your support, this trip is not possible. Not only will I personally grow from this challenging and unique experience, but I will connect with new people to develop a constructive dialogue about our lives in the United States and the world.</p>
<p>Upon returning, we will have the incredible opportunity to construct a national dialogue about the Mississippi by creating a documentary of our experiences.  This documentary will spark conversations about our national resources, water usage, the meaning of community, and the very nature (pun!) of what it means to be ""in nature.""  We believe strongly that these are dialogues that our nation must be having more often with one another, and I would be proud to be a part of this legacy.  Besides, everyone likes a good documentary, amiright? </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a family of four in an unhealthy and unsafe envirinment.  A sewage spill happened due to the landlords deferred maintinance (pulled an eight inch ball of roots out of the main drain).  There have been four clean up companies out to give an estimate but the landlord will not hire any of them to clean up propertly.</p>
<p>Since some of the sheetrock was pulled out, there is clearly black mold growing between the walls.  I have contacted city code enforcement, the health department and an attorney, but none of those can do anything to help with the housing situation.</p>
<p>Our landlord will not renew our lease now that we have called City Code enforcement and complained about the lack of sufficient clean up.</p>
<p>We need to have a place to move into when we get back from the funeral next week.</p>
<p>The boys' father just left Colorado to work in California when we got word that his father died unexpectedly on vacation scuba diving, so we are all grienving right now.</p>
<p>Any donations will go directly towards moving expenses, we are already approved for a house, we just need the funds to get out of this unsafe environment.</p>

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>The <strong>Factory Farming Awareness Coalition</strong> is an educational non-profit dedicated to empowering people to help the environment, animals, and our own health through our daily food choices.</p>
<p>FFAC educates people about factory farming through presentations and public outreach campaigns. We have given over 200 presentations across the United States and Mexico to classes, community organizations, and businesses.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Issue</h2>
<p>Nearly 10 billion animals are raised for food every year in the United States, 99% of them on factory farms. This system is hugely detrimental for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Environment</strong>: Factory farming is one of the leading causes of water pollution, deforestation, soil erosion, and climate change.</li>
<li>
<strong>Animals</strong>: The animals raised on factory farms spend their entire lives confined indoors with thousands of other animals, often in spaces so small they cannot even turn around.</li>
<li>
<strong>Workers</strong>: Workers on factory farms and in slaughterhouses face some of the most dangerous working conditions in the country with no access to health care or fair wages.</li>
<li>
<strong>Public Health</strong>: The overconsumption of animal products plays a major role in the health epidemics facing this country (heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity), and the overuse of antibiotics in animals puts us at risk of antibiotic-resistant epidemics.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Victory</h2>
<p>For the second year in a row, we won nearly $50,000 worth of free advertisements on San Francisco's public transit system. We will use this opportunity to educate people about the impacts of factory farming on animals and on the environment.</p>

</p>
<h3><b>“<i>What
I need, and what you get?”</i></b></h3>
<p>
	To carry out
the survey I need to scientifically name each plant that I
encounter in my study area. To do this a botanist uses an
identification flora, which is usually composed of multiple choice
keys, based on the morphological characters of the plant that is
being identified. These books are the botanist's best friend because
they enable the identification of plants that he/she has not yet been seen
meaning that new areas can be studied independently without direct
transmission of knowledge. In the study of the European flora, we are
very lucky to have access to good quality identification keys at
accessible prices. This is unfortunately not the case for Turkey's
flora: P.H.Davis and his team from the University of Edinburgh have
produced a very good identification key, however the 11 volumes of
the «Flora of Turkey and the East Aegean Islands » costs 1700 GBP.
My budget is too small to support such an investment but it is the
only book offering identification keys for the study area, no
regional book for the south west of Anatolia yet exists (until I
write one) and without out it I will be unable to identify and keep a
log of those species that have already been located.</p>
<p>
	This is why, to

All of the adjacent properties have opted to cut down the majority of their trees in favor of grazing fields, which leaves limited options for local wildlife, such as White-tailed deer.

The proposed tree species would include Black Walnut, Pecan, Persimmon, Red Mulberry, and Redbud. These trees were selected for their appeal to wildlife, in hopes of promoting biodiversity and restoring the natural ecosystem. The trees would serve a secondary purpose by providing more cover to our deer from hunters on the road, or on the adjacent properties. <br/><br/>Our forest area is approximately 15 acres, and of course 1,000 trees may not be enough to completely fill it out. However, I am confident that it will be a good start. I would like to continue maintaining the work my Great Grandfather did for the local environment. I currently live in the suburbs, and planting this many trees on the property is the most significant way that I can think of to make a contribution to nature.

<p>We are working on a campaign to fight for a national climate change action plan for Canadians. Our campaign kicks off with a video targeted at voters (regardless of their political preferences) to encourage them to send letters to their Members of Parliament (MPs). The letters are pre-written and will ask their MPs to pledge to:</p> <ul>
<li>end fossil fuel subsidies</li> <li>put a price on corporate carbon and</li> <li>create a renewable energy plan for Canada.</li> </ul>
<p>Your contribution will help with the promotion of<span style=""background-color: initial;""> our campaign video, spreading awareness about the need to take action on Climate Change. We are aiming to have MPs sign the pledge on <a href=""climatefast.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">climatefast.ca</a> to show their support for our environment by having voters express their concern over this issue. With more than 110 MPs having already pledged their commitment, we are hoping to have a majority of MPs in Parliament to support our cause.</span></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>CIN strives to increase climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts by the public through our educational and action-oriented events. In the past, the Climate Impact Network has the Sustainable Food Conference at the University of Toronto.

</div></div>","Climate Impact Network We are an organization dedicated to empowering the public with respect to climate change action, founded by Alice Zhu, an environment student at the University of Toronto.



We are working on a campaign to fight for a national climate change action plan for Canadians. Our campaign kicks off with a video targeted at voters (regardless of their political preferences) to encourage them to send letters to their Members of Parliament (MPs). The letters are pre-written and will ask their MPs to pledge to: 
end fossil fuel subsidies put a price on corporate carbon and create a renewable energy plan for Canada. 
Your contribution will help with the promotion of our campaign video, spreading awareness about the need to take action on Climate Change. We are aiming to have MPs sign the pledge on climatefast.ca to show their support for our environment by having voters express their concern over this issue. With more than 110 MPs having already pledged their commitment, we are hoping to have a majority of MPs in Parliament to support our cause.
  The Impact CIN strives to increase climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts by the public through our educational and action-oriented events. In the past, the Climate Impact Network has the Sustainable Food Conference at the University of Toronto. We are hoping to reach out to more people by starting a Youth Leadership Program in the Greater Toronto Area and holding another Sustainability Conference April 2015.

<h1>THE FILAFAB SYSTEM</h1>
<p>We have worked tirelessly to produce a filament extruder which is robust, reliable, compact and easy to use.  The FilaFab system is the market leading filament extrusion and winding system for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 years of continuous research and development - ready to go!</li>
<li>Industrial design miniaturised for your desktop - a real heavyweight!</li>
<li>Easily handles a wide variety of materials - in a league of its own in terms of versatility.</li>
<li>Many critical safety features built-in.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1 FilaFab Extruders</h1>
<p>We have two versions of the FilaFab Extruder available, the EX100 and EX350.  </p>
<h1>EX100</h1>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444846845/eyiel6p5yxvrbehbfc5j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>EX100 is the standard model with a compact yet powerful motor drive, ideal for extruding both ABS and PLA and where space is at a premium.</p>
<h1>EX350</h1>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444846901/ezila2hn5z1gxnzrajlf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For those who are serious about recycling or are looking to produce custom batches we would recommend the EX350 model which provides significantly more power and speed to the drive system and also features a speed adjuster.  This means that it can more easily handle some of the other polymers other than ABS and PLA.</p>
<p>Both models have common features which make them stand out from the crowd:</p>
<p><b>All-Metal Powerful Motor Drive </b>- Consistent power is delivered to the auger through careful motor selection and attention to the drive-train design with dedicated electronics to maintain motor torque and velocity.  Unlike some extruders we have not used any plastic parts.</p>
<p><b>Force Distribution</b> - Managing the high forces created by the extrusion process has been taken care of by our extra robust steel frame system which enables a high power output within a small form factor.</p>
<p><b>High Speed</b> - Precision engineering and a heavy duty drive-train combine to provide a high speed extrusion output for a range of materials. Extrude up to an astonishing 1kg of filament per hour.</p>
<p><b>Tolerance of Filament</b> - Careful nozzle selection and winding speed ensures accurate filament with a high throughput and good tolerance, to rival the best mass produced filament on the market.  Each machine is supplied with 1.75mm and 2.85mm nozzles, other sizes are available.</p>
<p><b>Variety of Materials</b> - Unlike some other extruders which are limited to certain plastics we have designed FilaFab to handle a vast array of different materials and compounds, including: ABS, PLA, EVA, HDPE, LDPE and more.</p>
<p><b>Colour Choice</b> - Combine readily available colourants to produce any colour of filament you require.  Try producing filament that changes colour by adding different mixtures at various stages of extrusion.</p>
<p><b>Safety - </b>The robust design includes many safety features, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>Emergency stop button </li>
<li>Auto shutdown on mains failure</li>
<li>Fully encased power supply </li>
<li>Nozzle and hopper guards</li>
<li>Internal over Voltage and Current protection</li>
<li>Steel powder coated enclosure</li>
<li>Non slip feet</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Aesthetics </b>- Available in blue, black or yellow.</p>
<h1>2 FilaFab Filament Winder</h1>
<p>Note: Since launch we have made some design changes to the winding system to incorporate a more powerful motor and better spool loading mechanism.  The form factor of the winding system has therefore changed with a slightly taller enclosure, the spool is now positioned to one side and the controls have been moved to the side panel. The optical sensor now comes with a 'filament puller' peripheral which uses a motor to pull the filament to the correct diameter. We will update the photographs soon!</p>
<p>The extruders work without the winder by spooling under gravity however the winder allows for automatic spooling in one easy step and is a great accessory to any extruder.  The use of the winder maximizes the quality of the filament and the ease by which you can transfer filament to your printer.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444847127/tv76ftpvcxbg4uxwfuvn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>Open Source</b> - How the filament is managed after extrusion is important in order to achieve a consistent high quality filament.  For this reason we have built in an open source sensor and accessory system which enables a variety of accessories to be attached to best suit your requirements.  Two rails and a power/communications port are located on the front of the extruder for connecting one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various filament sensors</li>
<li>Filament tension controllers</li>
<li>Cooling devices such as fans</li>
<li>Filament guide wheels</li>

<p>Sensors and accessories and designed to be mounted in printed plastic enclosures to give you the versatility to produce your own and also to modify and upgrade if required.  At the end of the campaign enclosure designs will be made available to freely download and print your own. Alternatively we are offering pre-printed enclosures for you, see reward chart.</p>
<p>We already have two sensors available and are working on some accessories to go along side them.  All files will be available to download after the campaign finishes.</p>

<b>Infrared Sensor</b> - The default sensors are used to automatically control the winding speed.  As filament is extruded it passes by two infrared sensors which are fed to the winding control system. If the filament deviates from the specified path the winder will adjust winding speed to compensate. This ensures that despite the spool's effective diameter changing as more filament is wound the speed remains almost constant, this feedback control loop ensures that the filament is not stretched out of shape while being wound.<br/>

<b>Optical Micrometer</b> - We are pleased to make available this precision optical micrometer, designed by Filip Mulier at Objects With Intelligence. The sensor was an obvious choice for our open sensor system by providing a real time width measurement of the extruded filament. Connected via the front panel accessory port the winder automatically detects it and self configures for its use.  The winding of the filament is now automatically controlled to maintain the filament at the required width.  The desired width is set either by the controls on the winding machine or by the soon to be released smartphone app.<br/>

THE FILAFAB SYSTEM
We have worked tirelessly to produce a filament extruder which is robust, reliable, compact and easy to use.  The FilaFab system is the market leading filament extrusion and winding system for the following reasons:

3 years of continuous research and development - ready to go!
Industrial design miniaturised for your desktop - a real heavyweight!
Easily handles a wide variety of materials - in a league of its own in terms of versatility.
Many critical safety features built-in.

1 FilaFab Extruders
We have two versions of the FilaFab Extruder available, the EX100 and EX350.  
EX100

EX100 is the standard model with a compact yet powerful motor drive, ideal for extruding both ABS and PLA and where space is at a premium.

Auto shutdown on mains failure
Fully encased power supply 
Nozzle and hopper guards
Internal over Voltage and Current protection
Steel powder coated enclosure
Non slip feet

Aesthetics - Available in blue, black or yellow.

Cooling devices such as fans
Filament guide wheels


Sensors and accessories and designed to be mounted in printed plastic enclosures to give you the versatility to produce your own and also to modify and upgrade if required.  At the end of the campaign enclosure designs will be made available to freely download and print your own. Alternatively we are offering pre-printed enclosures for you, see reward chart.
We already have two sensors available and are working on some accessories to go along side them.  All files will be available to download after the campaign finishes.

Infrared Sensor - The default sensors are used to automatically control the winding speed.  As filament is extruded it passes by two infrared sensors which are fed to the winding control system. If the filament deviates from the specified path the winder will adjust winding speed to compensate. This ensures that despite the spool's effective diameter changing as more filament is wound the speed remains almost constant, this feedback control loop ensures that the filament is not stretched out of shape while being wound.


Optical Micrometer - We are pleased to make available this precision optical micrometer, designed by Filip Mulier at Objects With Intelligence. The sensor was an obvious choice for our open sensor system by providing a real time width measurement of the extruded filament. Connected via the front panel accessory port the winder automatically detects it and self configures for its use.  The winding of the filament is now automatically controlled to maintain the filament at the required width.  The desired width is set either by the controls on the winding machine or by the soon to be released smartphone app.
Development

We have developed FilaFab over the last three years and it has undergone extensive research, development and prototyping.  We have taken on board feedback from customers of previous versions and the FilaFab offered today is a highly developed market ready machine.
We have a large workshop in Somerset setup with prototyping capabilities which means we have been able to design and test all of the bespoke components.
We have suppliers for all components which we have used before and built up relationships with.  We have all the practical resources to meet your pledges.  Our design aims throughout have been:

To produce the best desktop filament extrusion and winding system available. 
Attention to detail with exceptional performance. 
Safe to use in a variety of environments. 
Low cost of ownership. 
Quick and easy to use. 
Easy to service. 
Compatible with future concepts. 
Compatible with existing devices. 
Rapid extrusion. 
Extrude and wind a lot of different materials. 
Adaptable.

We pride ourselves on the fact that the FilaFab system is robust and fit for purpose and as mentioned above this has already been endorsed by the market.

WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
We have spent many months completing the design and pre-production stages for our new desktop extruder and winder combination and are now seeking your help to bring them to market. With your backing we can pay for the initial tooling and minimum order quantities required to get the price to a feasible level. We have a number or rewards with savings of up to 50% compared to our anticipated after launch RRP price.
With enough backers we can get the cost low enough to start delivering our machines to business hubs in developing nations. We want to see local businesses created collecting and recycling plastics to use and resell in a safe and sustainable way. Products can be produced using low cost 3D Printers fed from FilaFab machines. Filament can be sold on for profit or used directly. FilaFab can be taken directly to the point of usage which removes the necessity to transport large volumes of plastics to centralised locations. Another major reason we need your help is for us to develop our our exciting range of FilaFab Peripheral devices and expanded range products, see the What's Next section for more details. Note also that as way of thanks for your amazing support we will be offering supporters special offers and discounts and also order priority.
REWARDS








WHAT'S NEXT?  
We have designed FilaFab EX Extruders and FilaFab Winder to be powerful and fit-for-purpose working together or standalone, but we are also working towards our next generation or FilaFab accessories, upgrades and add-ons which you will be able to take advantage of when released. All backers will receive a supporters discount on these future products to add-on to your extruder or winder.

Determine the fate of the plants according to level of contamination.

Re-test soil for overall reduction in contamination.

</div><br/></div>","Short Summary
Fifty years from now, every American home will be using biogas. It is the simplest form of truly renewable energy of all to produce and one of the biggest no-brainers since fire and the wheel. There are no technical reason every home in the world is not already using biogas other than most people simply do not know about it. Education is the key. 


We are seeking to raise funds to place home biogas units Made in the USA using recycled materials by Hestia Home Biogas at select non-profit educational sites  where they may be visited by the public and utilized by educators to provide students with hands-on experience operating small scale biodigesters and using biogas.  

We can add installations for every $3,000 we raise, beginning with the Greenburgh Nature Center in Scarsdale, New York. The first five proposed sites are... 
Greenburgh Nature Center, Scarsdale, New York
Mud Creek Farm permaculture demonstration site, Hudson, NY

Rooftop garden of national magazine, Washington DC.
Global Vertical Farms, Philadelphia area, Pennsylvania




The thought-provoking renewable natural gas symbol was developed for the Biogas Education Network crowdfunding campaign, and we hope it becomes adopted as the international symbol for renewable natural gas. For perks, we are offering bumper stickers, coffee mugs and t-shirts with this original logo.

<ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Idea<br/>
</h3> <p>At Costa del Grillo Farm we are used to develop ideas for saving energy, recycling and save resources. <span>Among other things, the light in the horse zone is served by an off-grid solar system meanwhile the club house is heated with a Rocket Mass Heater</span> that<i><b>
</b></i>allows us to use firewood in a more efficient way. The last summer we build a <b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlJpO66PNPc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wood Oven</a></b> with 100% recycled material and insulate with horse manure. <br/></p>
<p>
The
windy days have inspired us to protect our stables by building a
<b>straw-bale wall</b>, acting as a windshield. And last but not least, we are very proud to host the first productive prototype of <b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPMtAM0-okY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ARETHA System</a> </b>(an idea of Roberto's father developed with the Politecnico di Milano University together a bunch of retired researcher) which gives us hot water.</p>
<p>Few month after the farm birth, we felt the urgency to have a <b>laboratory</b> for transforming the land's fruits, knowing too that was too much challenging for our resources.  Sharing our vision with Massimo, a local Designer Architect, we realized that dreams always come true if you follow the right direction. A Straw-Bale building is something that can be a reality in few month.<br/></p> <ul> <li>Because is aligned with our vision efficient self sustainability<br/>
</li> <li>Because we use a low impact material such as straw and wood</li>
<li>Because the main material (straw) is produced nearby the farm <br/>
</li> <li>Because the building process is simpler and can mostly be done with our hands</li>
<li>Because the building process could be a party far all those people who want to learn a different lifestyle<br/>
</li>
<li>Because, once productive, the FarmLab can become a meeting point for <span>all those who are committed to the rebirth of this beautiful valley</span><br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>We are ready<br/>
</h3> <p><b>Thanks to you we can to achieve the goal because everything is already set up such as the project and all permits</b>. <br/></p>
<p>Massimo followed some straw-bale construction courses and we are setting up a network of people that will happily teach us at Costa del Grillo how to build in such way. <br/></p>
<p><b>So we are ready to start the next springtime. </b><br/></p>

<span>Abbiamo impostato un budget basso perché vogliamo costruire il laboratorio con le nostre mani, con il vostro sostegno e con l'aiuto di quelle persone che si uniranno a noi durante il processo di costruzione la prossima primavera. Poiché crediamo fortemente in questo progetto, costruiremo il laboratorio in ogni caso, ma il vostro aiuto è fondamentale.<br/> La costruzione è molto semplice: un tetto a singola falda collegato al fienile esistente, un piano e due locali. Un locale è il laboratorio con tutte le prescrizioni di legge. Il secondo locale è un magazzino. L'edificio è costituito da un telaio strutturale in legno tamponato con balle di paglia e intonacato con un sistema a base di calce traspirante.</span><br/><br/><h3>I benefit<br/>

<br/><br/><h3>L'idea </h3>
<p><span>A Costa del Grillo siamo abituati a sviluppare idee per il risparmio energetico, di risorse ed il riciclo. Tra le altre cose, la luce nel maneggio è servita da un sistema solare autonomo (off-grid) mentre la club house è riscaldata con una Rocket Mass Heater che ci permette di utilizzare legna in modo più efficiente. L'estate scorsa abbiamo costruito un <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwR3Ik_ieAM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">forno a legna</a> con il 100% di materiale riciclato e isolato con fango e letame di cavallo.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span> I giorni di vento ci hanno ispirato a proteggere le nostre stalle con la costruzione di un muro antivento fatto con balle di paglia. E, ultimo ma non meno importante, siamo molto orgogliosi di ospitare il primo prototipo produttivo di <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPMtAM0-okY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aretha System </a>(un'idea del padre di Roberto sviluppata con il Politecnico di Milano ed un gruppo di ricercatori in pensione), che ci dà l'acqua calda.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span> Poco tempo dopo la nascita dell'azienda, abbiamo sentito l'urgenza di avere un laboratorio per trasformare i frutti della terra, sapendo anche che era troppo impegnativo per le nostre risorse. Condividendo la nostra visione con Massimo, un geometra locale, ci siamo resi conto che i sogni si avverano sempre se si segue la giusta direzione. Un edificio in paglia è qualcosa che può essere una realtà in pochi mesi.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Perché è allineato con la nostra visione di efficiente auto sostenibilità</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Perché utilizziamo un materiale a basso impatto come la paglia e il legno</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Poiché il materiale principale (paglia) è prodotto nelle vicinanze della fattoria</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Poiché la costruzione è semplice e può in gran parte essere fatta con le nostre mani</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Poiché il processo di costruzione potrebbe essere un'occasione per tutte quelle persone che vogliono imparare uno stile di vita diverso</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Perché, una volta produttivo, il Laboratorio può diventare un punto di incontro per tutti coloro che si impegnano per la rinascita di questa bellissima valle</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Noi siamo pronti</h3>
<p><b><span>Grazie a voi  possiamo per raggiungere l'obiettivo, perché tutto è già impostato, come il progetto e i permessi di costruire.</span></b></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Massimo ha seguito alcuni corsi per realizzare costruzioni in paglia e stiamo allestendo una rete di persone che fortunatamente ci insegneranno a Costa del Grillo come costruire in questo modo.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>

  The Project

 We set a low budget because we want to build the Lab with our hands, with your support and with the help of those people who will join us during the building process next springtime. Since we strongly believe in this project, we are going to build the lab in any case but your help is essential.
The construction is quite simple: a single pitch roof attached to the existing barn, one-story and two rooms. One room is the Lab with all law's prescription. The second room is a storage. The building consists in a wooden structural frame infilled with straw bales and rendered with a breathable lime-based system.


The Perks
We are happy to give you the unique experience to be a part of Costa del Grillo Farm.

Adventure Day: which consists in one day at Costa del Grillo for you, your partner or your family. Depending on your attitudes, we can walk or horse-ride  discovering some wonderful and mystic places nearby the Farm. If you prefer, you can stay at the farm: we'll teach you how to cook some typical Italian food.

Lavender Products: our 100% natural essential oil and or Lavender Water.




2015 Photo Calendar: a printable calendar with the Costa del Grillo Pictures, for those who don't want to miss to be part of the project team.







   The Idea
 At Costa del Grillo Farm we are used to develop ideas for saving energy, recycling and save resources. Among other things, the light in the horse zone is served by an off-grid solar system meanwhile the club house is heated with a Rocket Mass Heater that
allows us to use firewood in a more efficient way. The last summer we build a Wood Oven with 100% recycled material and insulate with horse manure. 

The
windy days have inspired us to protect our stables by building a
straw-bale wall, acting as a windshield. And last but not least, we are very proud to host the first productive prototype of ARETHA System (an idea of Roberto's father developed with the Politecnico di Milano University together a bunch of retired researcher) which gives us hot water.
Few month after the farm birth, we felt the urgency to have a laboratory for transforming the land's fruits, knowing too that was too much challenging for our resources.  Sharing our vision with Massimo, a local Designer Architect, we realized that dreams always come true if you follow the right direction. A Straw-Bale building is something that can be a reality in few month.  Because is aligned with our vision efficient self sustainability
 Because we use a low impact material such as straw and wood
Because the main material (straw) is produced nearby the farm 
 Because the building process is simpler and can mostly be done with our hands
Because the building process could be a party far all those people who want to learn a different lifestyle

Because, once productive, the FarmLab can become a meeting point for all those who are committed to the rebirth of this beautiful valley
    We are ready
 Thanks to you we can to achieve the goal because everything is already set up such as the project and all permits. 
Massimo followed some straw-bale construction courses and we are setting up a network of people that will happily teach us at Costa del Grillo how to build in such way. 
So we are ready to start the next springtime.

Versione Italiana
L'azienda agricola Costa del Grillo è nata 4 anni fa con una visione di efficiente sostenibilità. Tutto è cominciato con questa frase: ""La passione per i cavalli e l'amore per la natura hanno trovato casa"". Da quel momento cerchiamo di modellare la nostra vita osservando la natura e interagendo con lei quanto più possibile per vivere in armonia. Lo scopo di questo progetto è quello di costruire il primo FarmLab nella valle e la prima costruzione in balle di paglia in provincia. Il Laboratorio in paglia ci dà la possibilità di trasformare in loco i prodotti della terra, come le erbe officinali ad esempio, seguendo la nostra visione permettendoci inoltre di condividere questa esperienza con la comunità locale e globale. Con il vostro contributo date una spinta all'economia  della valle e ci aiutate a dimostrare come la natura possa essere parte della vita!






Il Progetto



Abbiamo impostato un budget basso perché vogliamo costruire il laboratorio con le nostre mani, con il vostro sostegno e con l'aiuto di quelle persone che si uniranno a noi durante il processo di costruzione la prossima primavera. Poiché crediamo fortemente in questo progetto, costruiremo il laboratorio in ogni caso, ma il vostro aiuto è fondamentale. La costruzione è molto semplice: un tetto a singola falda collegato al fienile esistente, un piano e due locali. Un locale è il laboratorio con tutte le prescrizioni di legge. Il secondo locale è un magazzino. L'edificio è costituito da un telaio strutturale in legno tamponato con balle di paglia e intonacato con un sistema a base di calce traspirante.I benefit

Siamo lieti di offrirvi l'esperienza unica di essere parte del team di Costa del Grillo.

Adventure Day: che consiste in un giorno a Costa del Grillo per voi, il vostro partner o la vostra famiglia. A seconda delle attitudini, siamo in grado di camminare o andare a cavallo alla scoperta di alcuni luoghi meravigliosi e mistici vicino alla fattoria. Se si preferisce, è possibile stare presso l'azienda agricola dove è possibile partecipare ad alcune attività agricole oppure seguire alcuni corsi di cucina locale.


Lavender Products: il nostro olio essenziale di Lavanda puro al 100% e/o l'Acqua di Lavanda.






2015 Photo Calendar: un calendario con le foto di Costa del Grillo, per coloro che non vogliono perdere l'opportunità di fare parte del team.


L'idea 
A Costa del Grillo siamo abituati a sviluppare idee per il risparmio energetico, di risorse ed il riciclo. Tra le altre cose, la luce nel maneggio è servita da un sistema solare autonomo (off-grid) mentre la club house è riscaldata con una Rocket Mass Heater che ci permette di utilizzare legna in modo più efficiente. L'estate scorsa abbiamo costruito un forno a legna con il 100% di materiale riciclato e isolato con fango e letame di cavallo.

 I giorni di vento ci hanno ispirato a proteggere le nostre stalle con la costruzione di un muro antivento fatto con balle di paglia. E, ultimo ma non meno importante, siamo molto orgogliosi di ospitare il primo prototipo produttivo di Aretha System (un'idea del padre di Roberto sviluppata con il Politecnico di Milano ed un gruppo di ricercatori in pensione), che ci dà l'acqua calda.

 Poco tempo dopo la nascita dell'azienda, abbiamo sentito l'urgenza di avere un laboratorio per trasformare i frutti della terra, sapendo anche che era troppo impegnativo per le nostre risorse. Condividendo la nostra visione con Massimo, un geometra locale, ci siamo resi conto che i sogni si avverano sempre se si segue la giusta direzione. Un edificio in paglia è qualcosa che può essere una realtà in pochi mesi.

Perché è allineato con la nostra visione di efficiente auto sostenibilità
Perché utilizziamo un materiale a basso impatto come la paglia e il legno
Poiché il materiale principale (paglia) è prodotto nelle vicinanze della fattoria
Poiché la costruzione è semplice e può in gran parte essere fatta con le nostre mani
Poiché il processo di costruzione potrebbe essere un'occasione per tutte quelle persone che vogliono imparare uno stile di vita diverso
Perché, una volta produttivo, il Laboratorio può diventare un punto di incontro per tutti coloro che si impegnano per la rinascita di questa bellissima valle


 
Noi siamo pronti
Grazie a voi  possiamo per raggiungere l'obiettivo, perché tutto è già impostato, come il progetto e i permessi di costruire.

Massimo ha seguito alcuni corsi per realizzare costruzioni in paglia e stiamo allestendo una rete di persone che fortunatamente ci insegneranno a Costa del Grillo come costruire in questo modo.

 Siamo quindi pronti per iniziare già dalla prossima primavera.

</p><h2><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our Project </b></h2><p>With rising ocean levels and a changing climate, sustainability has become an important concept here and around the world. What better place is there for the development of sustainable practices than our educational institutions? Colleges and Universities have the capacity to be social innovators in practices that support a transformation for sustainability. They are the training grounds for our future leaders, the breeding ground for research and can become models of best practices. Tracing a path to sustainability means to lower our ecological footprint but it is also about forming communities; learning to live a healthier lifestyle; teaching the future generations; and learning from our mistakes. This is where we come in. We are here to support sustainable campus practices by building an international community.</p>
<p>This summer, four students from Dawson College will embark on a six week internship to  two Universities in the State of Morelos, Mexico to share ideas about sustainability and learn new practices. While in Mexico, we will work on the day to day maintenance of existing projects at the Universities and upon our return, we will share our new knowledge with the students and faculty at Dawson. </p>
<p>However, to make this cross cultural exchange of knowledge and sustainable values possible we need your help, whether this be through giving a donation or spreading awareness. All the money collected from this campaign will be used to support student driven sustainability initiatives in Mexico, such as medicinal gardens, waste management projects, and bringing the natural world into the classroom. The students in Cuernavaca are very excited to connect with the Canadian interns, sharing knowledge, experiences, and working together to create a sustainable future. </p>

<p>Hi I'm Ella! I'm also in my second semester of Environmental Science at Dawson with Mikayla, as well as the internal secretary of the Green Earth Club, and a volunteer with Sustainable Dawson. I'm super interested in a whole lot of things like bees and protists and clouds and Victorian literature and medical history and a slew of arts and crafts, but mostly I just really enjoy learning about the natural world, how it works, and most importantly, how to preserve it. This trip is such an exciting opportunity to be able to actually go and realize some of the things that we've been learning about over the past few months, and I can't wait to see all of the inventive and amazing projects the students in Mexico have been working on, and help out as best we can.

allow us to be among the first to arrive on the scene of the next disaster, exposing the truth and empowering affected communities.




The Perks!
Support us and you’ll earn our sincere thanks and some cool
stuff! 
If we don’t meet our goal, all funds raised will be spent on
training regional disaster response teams and buying new equipment. 
Regardless of your ability to support our campaign we invite
everyone to stay informed about the important work we do by regularly visiting www.waterkeeper.org and by using the
Indiegogo sharing tools to find new ways to help.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, my name is Domenico Patanè and I'm
one of the co-authors of a photographic book on Etna volcano one of the most
fantastic worldwide volcanoes.</p>
<p>Mount Etna is not only a volcano and
offers many natural itineraries and places to visit. It is also possible to easily
explore its central craters and every year it attract hundreds of thousands of
tourists, even though the best time to visit Etna is during a lava-producing
eruption (and this can happen often).</p>
<p>In the book, almost finished, we wanted
to bring together beautiful photos, stories and science of Etna. The reader and
those who visit this volcano will be immersed in a photographic journey (the visitor
will take home a souvenir) and may satisfy the palate and other senses, along
with the  intellectual curiosity. </p>
<p>The narrative follows the seasons and
the four elements of nature, that change and mark the journey of our life,  but also that of the volcano.</p>
<p>This book, written in Italian and
English, will be a quality book, 8.3
inches tall by 11.7 inches (horizontal A4 format) wide with excellent quality
paper. There are about 300 photos inside the book and they will be printed in
color and some of them in black and white. The book is almost completed, and it
will likely be between 220 and 240 pages with a color cover.</p>
<p>It is a tale of nature, beauty,
discovery,  science. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>
<br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>I want to
sell enough advance copies of the book to cover the printing costs, which are
substantial for a photographic book. A graphic designer is creating the layout
and cover for the book, and I hired a professional editor to make sure the book
doesn't have any errors, so it will look great and will be fun to read. I'm
also designing an eBook if you prefer that format.</p>
<p>By accepting
pre-orders for the book, I'll have seed money to cover the costs, and I can
have a better idea of how much interest there is in this book so I can better
estimate the total number to order. To thank you for supporting this project,
you'll be able to choose from a number of possibilities (see the entire list
below). The book and perks will be delivered on November 2014.</p>
<p>NOTE: For this campaign, I am not
charging shipping fees. To ship your book to you, I will ask that you send me
the amount  when the book is ready to
ship to cover those costs. If you need to have the book shipped, I can let you

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Mount Etna has been designated a Decade Volcano by the United Nations and in June 2013, it was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</p>
<p>Mount Etna, located in Sicily (Italy), is the most active volcano of the European continent and one of the most dynamic volcanoes in the world. Because it is located in a densely inhabited region since Greek times, it offers the largest historical record of volcanic phenomena and therefore represents the cradle of volcanology. The frequency of Etna’s eruptive episodes is very high as in 2000 when 64 spectacular lava fountains arose in five months only and as in the last year when 19 lava fountains occurred forming huge ash plumes up to 9 km high. Since the 1990's, more than 200 summit explosive events (from lava fountain to sub-Plinian) and numerous effusive events have occurred. Some of these effusive eruptions produced large lava flows, such as the 1991-93 eruption, while in other cases lava flows covered contemporaneously both main flanks of the volcano as during the 2001 and 2002-2003 multivent eruptions. Following, further eruptions occurred in 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008-2009.</p>
<p>
In recent years, Etna has been intensely active,
producing more than 40 lava fountaining episodes between 12 January 2011 and late-December
2013. Etna's New Southeast Crater (NSEC) remained in a
state of quiescence until the late evening of 21 January 2014, when a series of
Strombolian explosions heralded the onset of lava emission from new vents at
the eastern base of the NSEC cone. For the next two months, this rather
classical ""persistent"" summit Strombolian activity has been accompanied by
subterminal lava effusion. In June and August 2014, two episodes of mild Strombolian activity
and lava emission occurred from the NSEC, and in July-August 2014, Strombolian
activity and lava emission also occurred from new vents on the east flank of
the Northeast Crater (NEC).

</p>
<p>
On the basis of the particular and frequent
eruptions described briefly above, Mount Etna is unique and represents one of
the most formidable natural phenomena of the planet Earth. <br/></p>
<p>Etna volcano is characterized, better than any other volcano on Earth,
by good accessibility and intense fruition from the sea to its summit vents.
Tourism and use of land for agricultural purposes and forestry, as well as the
preservation of the natural environment, is a challenge for nourishing the

people can see and touch the vitality of planet Earth and realize how these
forces created the earth's crust on which we live. For this reason, in 2013,
UNESCO recognized Etna volcano as a World Natural Heritage site.<br/></p>

Every time you share our campaign it has the potential of doing good, while of course also helping our campaign. Thank you so much!</p><p> </p><h2>FAQ</h2><p><strong>Why do you cut trees? Why not use recycled wood?</strong></p><p>For the Seed, we use only certified, sustainably grown wood. Wood is a versatile, renewable material that is biodegradable and ecologically friendly. The trees felled for the Seed have grown to maturity and no longer sequester CO2 from the atmosphere with the rate that they did while growing. It is also important to stress that these trees come from managed, commercial forests, where cut trees are automatically replaced by new ones. We would never use wood from old growth forests, or indeed any wild forests. Finland is the most forested developed country in the world, with over 70% forest coverage, and our forests are currently used well below their sustainable capability.</p><p>Naturally, we fully support the use of recycled and upcycled materials. For the Seed, we spent a lot of time investigating possibilities like naturally fallen trees (storm felled, etc.), recycled wood, as well as upcycled sources. The problem there is, however, that in our experience setting up meaningful production pipelines with these materials is still very challenging, indeed nearly impossible, especially if you want to maintain high-quality control, as we do. The reality also is that even if we used recycled wood, its manufacturing, as well as the production, transportation, packaging and everything else would still be accounted for as using natural resources and causing emissions. While recycled and upcycled materials definitely offer sustainability possibilities, ultimately they are no magic bullet, or in themselves net positive.</p><p>That said, we will definitely continue to investigate recycled resources for future Tales by Trees products.</p><p><strong>Are the books printed on recycled paper?</strong></p><p>The books are printed on paper certified as FSC Mix. This is made from both recycled and sustainably grown sources, and gives us a great balance between sustainability and high quality paper fit for an art book.</p><p><strong>What about the packaging and delivery?</strong></p><p>All of our packaging is made from FSC certified recycled materials. We have designed our packaging solutions in a way that minimizes material use. For delivery, we use carbon neutral shipping worldwide.</p><p><strong>Why do you plant trees in Africa and protect forests only in Finland?</strong></p><p>While we are a Finnish company, the reason we have chosen to focus our planting efforts in Africa is that tropical trees grow faster and annually sequester far more CO2 from the atmosphere than Nordic trees do. As a result, tropical trees have a much bigger and faster impact on combating climate change than their Nordic counterparts. These trees also help local communities.</p><p>Meanwhile, Finland already enjoys more than 70% forest coverage. Forests in the Nordics are also carefully maintained and currently used below their sustainable capacity. It therefore makes sense to focus our reforestation efforts on countries where forest coverage is much smaller and where the forests are currently far less sustainable. With that said, in the end, we do indirectly plant trees also in the Nordic Countries. Since we only use materials from sustainably managed forests, each tree felled is guaranteed to be replaced by a new one.</p><p>The reason why we have chosen our home country Finland as our first conservation target has to do not only with logistics, but also with the types of forests that grow here. As mentioned earlier, Finland has plenty of trees and forests, but most of those forests are actually managed for use, and the number of protected wild forests could and should be higher. By protecting forests, we can increase local biodiversity and provide sanctuaries for animal species, resulting in a healthier planet.</p><p>Our plan is to diversify our positive impact to cover more methods and regions around the world in the future.</p><p><strong>How do you prove your claims?</strong></p><p>Our calculations are available <a href=""https://www.talesbytrees.com/net-positive-model/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on our website</a>.

<h3>Why the funding is needed and where it's going?</h3>
<p>Some people have asked how they can help clean up the 267.41 acre park which is planned to start in either Oct or Nov 2012 depending on weather. First the park has to rezoned from residential to commercial and conditional use permit has to be approved.</p>
<p>In the parks current state everything has to be brought in including power, food, water, and restrooms.  All funding will be used to help provide these needed services and equipment such as hard hats, gloves, brooms, trash bin rentals.</p>
<p>Everyone that contributes $5.00 or more will be given a signed 8 1/2"" x 11"" certificate of appreciation and have their name put the supporter wall at the park for all park visitors to see.</p>

</div></div>","Hi I am Christopher Jackiewicz I will be cleaning up Lake Dolores in Newberry Springs California.

Why the funding is needed and where it's going?
Some people have asked how they can help clean up the 267.41 acre park which is planned to start in either Oct or Nov 2012 depending on weather. First the park has to rezoned from residential to commercial and conditional use permit has to be approved.
In the parks current state everything has to be brought in including power, food, water, and restrooms.  All funding will be used to help provide these needed services and equipment such as hard hats, gloves, brooms, trash bin rentals.
Everyone that contributes $5.00 or more will be given a signed 8 1/2"" x 11"" certificate of appreciation and have their name put the supporter wall at the park for all park visitors to see.

Hector, the eldest son and heir makes a once-in-a-generation decision to get off government tobacco subsidies to GO ORGANIC.Between smoking his pipe and naps on the sofa reading comics, Gramps is out stealing real estate signs - a vain attempt at slowing down the encroaching suburbs. Sheriff Dan has him in his scope. Hector's sister, Cassandra, an anxiety-ridden self medicated teen worries how they'll rent the bees they're going to need to pollinate the orchard. Bee colony collapse disorder is just one thing setting her off today - white nose syndrome in bats is another. To calm down, she's discovered yoga with Tuvan throat singing and a side of alcohol. Granny just died of emphysema. Dad died 10 years ago. Enough. The tobacco is coming out and broccoli is going in.

</div></div>","Our Story

SCRAP-Denton is a sponsored project of SCRAP.  SCRAP is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit arts and environmental organization with a mission to inspire creative reuse and environmentally sustainable behavior by providing educational programs and affordable materials to the community.

We are starting a SCRAP Denton and we NEED YOUR HELP!!!Denton is an ideal city for a creative reuse center. We are a community of artists, students, educators, and idealists alike. Our families and friends have a vision of a sustainable and progressive way of life.SCRAP Denton retail center will be located just off the square, (215 W. Oak St. Denton, TX) and will sell all kinds of reuse materials for arts and crafts, plus school, office, and party supplies. We will accept donations of creative materials during regular store hours, so our inventory will change constantly and you will never know what you’re going to find! What do you think you will find? What will you make of it?




The Impact

Everybody benefits from SCRAP, local community, state, nation, world and future by filling minds rather than landfills! With the materials we collect we will be providing supplies at affordable prices and educating through outreach programs and workshops all while reducing waste. SCRAP Denton will also be offering a common place for artists, students, educators and other local non-profits to have studio, gallery and work space  for low cost rent!In 2010 SCRAP in Portland, Oregon was able to divert over 103 tons of reusable arts, crafts and educational materials from their local landfills! We plan to do the same in Denton. 




What We Need & What You Get


We need $12,000 to get started, this money will allow us to open our doors and provide educational opportunities in our classroom space, offer the opportunities for reuse artists to have a venue to show and share their art, and for community members to have a place to both donate and purchase the wonderful materials and supplies we will have available. The Creative Reuse Center will host many downtown and community wide events that promote and further our mission of reuse for both adults and children. As a startup donor we have a few perks for different levels of donation. 





You Can Help!
We Can NOT open this community store without start up funding!!! 

Spread our message to all your contacts, we have just 60 days to raise funds.

We are also in need of volunteers during the week and on weekends.

The funding will cover:

Hoop house structure 30’x 48’ high tunnel frame kit
Plastic sheathing
Drip irrigation
Endwalls
Basic ventilation package including manual roll-up sidewall ventilation & manual butterfly peak vents
Additional bracing kits for a moveable structure
Repair tape
Experienced construction crew leader
Costs of hosting a weekend-long workshop
Creation of instructional video
We've already received financial support through EQIP (Environmental Quality Incentives Program) from Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), but we need your help to bridge the gap! Even if we don’t reach our goal, we will still use what money we do get to purchase a smaller version of the hoop house, or one that is stationary.   
The ImpactNew farmers, growing skills, appreciation for gardening and farm equipment, friendships, flowers, herbs, young people’s understanding of where food comes from, compost, an awareness of nature, confidence, a sense of belonging, food, community…these are things EarthDance is growing… with your support!
Other Ways You Can HelpWe at EarthDance love all of our supporters! Even if you're not able to make a financial contribution, you can help us spread the word through word of mouth, Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter. You can also volunteer on the farm or at an event, or donate an item on our wish list.  Share the links and the love below and that will make a huge difference.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Down to the Wire</h3>
<div>You have $5, $10, $20, $50 to spend today. Coffee? A movie? dinner out? A concert? Tomorrow all you will have left of that money is a memory. You could do something radical instead. You could help change the world. </div>
<div>You could encourage innovation and development of sustainable farming techniques to deal with a changing climate. You could make sure that hundreds more people of all ages and interests have the opportunity to learn gardening, farming, and sustainable life skills. Together with similar donations from others, and the huge discount the seller has offered, your money can do a lot of good for a long time.</div>
<div>How do I know this? Because it's already working. This campaign has already succeeded, in many ways. In addition to the money raised by here, there have been several independent contributions, and generous private lenders have come forward to put up the balance of the $25,000. People from across the US and Canada have joined local friends to make sure Pinwheel continues. And the seller has given us additional time to finalize the pay-off arrangements.</div>
<div> So donate more. Donate anyway. Because it says you value the farm, about healthy food, and about the environment. The smaller the loan we need, the better off the farm will be going forward. But most important, your support of this campaign...even a $5 donation...is a tangible reminder that I am not alone in this effort to preserve precious farmland. And that is priceless.</div>
<div>So please...for this last weekend...donate to the campaign...share it far and wide...and keep PInwheel in your thoughts and prayers. </div>

<p></p>
<p>18 years ago, I bought a barren 10-acre cornfield behind my house to save it from becoming a warehouse. Since then I've worked relentlessly to create a sustainable sheep and vegetable farm right on the city limits of Lawrence, KS, with some of the best soil in the  world and the Kansas River flowing close beneath it (learn more at Pinwheel's <a href=""http://www.pinwheelfarm.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.pinwheelfarm.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.pinwheelfarm.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> and <a href=""http://www.pinwheelfarm.blogspot.com)."" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.pinwheelfarm.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a>). About 6 years ago, I entered into a contract to buy an adjacent acre (comprising 3 parcels) that will complete the farm with essential street frontage, a well-built metal barn for the sheep, a lovely grove of trees that the seller's sons planted in the 1960s, and a small house that I've been renovating for 3 years on a shoestring budget.</p>
<p>Now I'm facing one of my biggest challenges yet, and you can help. A series of misfortunes (see * in ""<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">HISTORY, THE SHORT VERSION""</b> at the end of this article if you want more details on ""how things came to be this way"") has put me in dire financial straits. However, the seller of the acre has made the generous offer to discount the contract by more than half--IF I pay him $25,000 by December 8 <strike>October 8</strike>. </p>
<p>(Find ""Pinwheel Farm"" on FaceBook if you want to message me with questions.) <br/></p>
<p>Your immediate generous contribution will help pay this final ""ransom"" so that the farm will be free to be a farm forever. And it will forever be, in part, YOUR farm, and our descendents' farm. Every contributor will be honored on our ""Helping Hands"" display (see Perks). When my stewardship is over, the farm will pass to others who will carry on my work to build and protect it. It will never be sold.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/67237/files/20130911012604-IMG_2481.JPG?1378887964"" src="""" style=""width: 333.3333333333333px; height: 250px;""/></b></p>
<b>MORE ABOUT ME:</b> As well a farmer, I'm a writer, artist, song-writer, inventor, mender-and-fixer, penny-pincher, volunteer coordinator, sustainable liver, researcher, teacher, spiritual pilgrim, grandmother, generous human being, good listener, and a whole lot more. I have a BS in Human Resource Management from Friends University, but that's nothing compared to the hands-on learning that life has brought me through voluntary service, friends, family, mentors, and other ""classrooms"" too numerous to mention. The farm is my way of passing on to others the skills and knowledge that so many have generously shared with me over the years.<br/><p></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">What We Need</span><br/></p>
<p>You're wondering--The seller wants $25,000; I'm asking for $35,000. What's up with that? The extra $10,000 ensures that the fees and taxes for this fundraising effort can be paid, in addition the contract buy-out. </p>
<p>Any funds left after I pay the $25,000 and all fees and taxes will go first towards 2013 property taxes on all the farm's land. </p>
<p>Additional funds (we'd love to get more than $35,000!) will go towards basic farm infrastructure improvements such as finishing the new veggie washhouse, cold storage for our veggies, sheep barn improvements (including small-scale milking facilities),  completing the new water well and well house for the farm, ADA accessible toilet facilities, and off-grid energy projects (not necessarily in that order). All funds will go towards debt retirement or lasting improvements on the farm, not operating or personal expenses.</p>
<p>If this campaign doesn't reach its goal, every penny left after the Indiegogo fee is paid will go towards the $25,000 contract buyout. Meanwhile, I'm working hard to find other sources of loans and donations to bridge any gap. We can do this! We WILL do this!</p>
<p>I want to assure you that I do not own land to profit from its resale. It's my ""retirement plan"", but not because I'll cash it in and move to a retirement home. It will be my pantry and my place to live for the rest of my life. Although I'll have title to the land, it will continue to own me--I am its steward, not its master. I will do everything I can to ensure that it will never be sold again, so that it will be available to future generations to continue farming without going through the years of debt and overwork that I've endured. It will be free to be a farm.</p>

<p>Moderate (by my pinch-penny standards) donations will get you great Pinwheel Farm products, discounts, and promotional items...there's something for everyone.</p>
<p>Larger donations will get you even more wonderful perks. By sponsoring a sheep or a tree, you'll feel a very special, unique connection with the farm for years to come. Participating in special events at the farm will bring you and your friends even closer to the farm's Community of Life.</p>

You have $5, $10, $20, $50 to spend today. Coffee? A movie? dinner out? A concert? Tomorrow all you will have left of that money is a memory. You could do something radical instead. You could help change the world. 
You could encourage innovation and development of sustainable farming techniques to deal with a changing climate. You could make sure that hundreds more people of all ages and interests have the opportunity to learn gardening, farming, and sustainable life skills. Together with similar donations from others, and the huge discount the seller has offered, your money can do a lot of good for a long time.
How do I know this? Because it's already working. This campaign has already succeeded, in many ways. In addition to the money raised by here, there have been several independent contributions, and generous private lenders have come forward to put up the balance of the $25,000. People from across the US and Canada have joined local friends to make sure Pinwheel continues. And the seller has given us additional time to finalize the pay-off arrangements.
 So donate more. Donate anyway. Because it says you value the farm, about healthy food, and about the environment. The smaller the loan we need, the better off the farm will be going forward. But most important, your support of this campaign...even a $5 donation...is a tangible reminder that I am not alone in this effort to preserve precious farmland. And that is priceless.
So please...for this last weekend...donate to the campaign...share it far and wide...and keep PInwheel in your thoughts and prayers. 
Short SummaryThe seller will cancel over $30,000 of the farm's debt if I put $25,000 in his hands by December 8 October 8. The entire farm (except for the separate, adjacent rental Farmhouse) will have a clear title, and the 3 separate parcels can be joined as one. This will free me and the farm to make even greater contributions to our community. Pinwheel isn't just about producing sheep and veggies, it's also about teaching skills, preserving the ecosystem, sharing nature, and fostering spiritual growth to benefit everyone.

Not-So-Short Summary

18 years ago, I bought a barren 10-acre cornfield behind my house to save it from becoming a warehouse. Since then I've worked relentlessly to create a sustainable sheep and vegetable farm right on the city limits of Lawrence, KS, with some of the best soil in the  world and the Kansas River flowing close beneath it (learn more at Pinwheel's website and blog). About 6 years ago, I entered into a contract to buy an adjacent acre (comprising 3 parcels) that will complete the farm with essential street frontage, a well-built metal barn for the sheep, a lovely grove of trees that the seller's sons planted in the 1960s, and a small house that I've been renovating for 3 years on a shoestring budget.
Now I'm facing one of my biggest challenges yet, and you can help. A series of misfortunes (see * in ""HISTORY, THE SHORT VERSION"" at the end of this article if you want more details on ""how things came to be this way"") has put me in dire financial straits. However, the seller of the acre has made the generous offer to discount the contract by more than half--IF I pay him $25,000 by December 8 October 8. 
(Find ""Pinwheel Farm"" on FaceBook if you want to message me with questions.) 
Your immediate generous contribution will help pay this final ""ransom"" so that the farm will be free to be a farm forever. And it will forever be, in part, YOUR farm, and our descendents' farm. Every contributor will be honored on our ""Helping Hands"" display (see Perks). When my stewardship is over, the farm will pass to others who will carry on my work to build and protect it. It will never be sold.


MORE ABOUT ME: As well a farmer, I'm a writer, artist, song-writer, inventor, mender-and-fixer, penny-pincher, volunteer coordinator, sustainable liver, researcher, teacher, spiritual pilgrim, grandmother, generous human being, good listener, and a whole lot more. I have a BS in Human Resource Management from Friends University, but that's nothing compared to the hands-on learning that life has brought me through voluntary service, friends, family, mentors, and other ""classrooms"" too numerous to mention. The farm is my way of passing on to others the skills and knowledge that so many have generously shared with me over the years.
What We Need
You're wondering--The seller wants $25,000; I'm asking for $35,000. What's up with that? The extra $10,000 ensures that the fees and taxes for this fundraising effort can be paid, in addition the contract buy-out. 
Any funds left after I pay the $25,000 and all fees and taxes will go first towards 2013 property taxes on all the farm's land. 
Additional funds (we'd love to get more than $35,000!) will go towards basic farm infrastructure improvements such as finishing the new veggie washhouse, cold storage for our veggies, sheep barn improvements (including small-scale milking facilities),  completing the new water well and well house for the farm, ADA accessible toilet facilities, and off-grid energy projects (not necessarily in that order). All funds will go towards debt retirement or lasting improvements on the farm, not operating or personal expenses.
If this campaign doesn't reach its goal, every penny left after the Indiegogo fee is paid will go towards the $25,000 contract buyout. Meanwhile, I'm working hard to find other sources of loans and donations to bridge any gap. We can do this! We WILL do this!
I want to assure you that I do not own land to profit from its resale. It's my ""retirement plan"", but not because I'll cash it in and move to a retirement home. It will be my pantry and my place to live for the rest of my life. Although I'll have title to the land, it will continue to own me--I am its steward, not its master. I will do everything I can to ensure that it will never be sold again, so that it will be available to future generations to continue farming without going through the years of debt and overwork that I've endured. It will be free to be a farm.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can make a short-term low/no-interest loan, please contact me immediately!
I know (because I'm there myself) that sometimes there just isn't a dollar to spare, no matter how important the cause. You can still help in so many ways, and still be a ""Helping Hand""!


First and foremost, make this campaign viral! Share this campaign with everyone you can think of, via FaceBook, Twitter, email, or any way you can. Use the Indiegogo ""share tools"". Ask your friends and family to share it with their friends and family. Reach out to groups and strangers that you think share our values and long-term goals.

Keep me, the farm, the Embers family, our donors and other benefactors, and this campaign in your thoughts and prayers. 

Send me encouraging words via FaceBook, email, a postcard (if you know what those are), or the phone.
Contribute in-kind to the farm so that I can use all cash resources for the Big Payment. Groceries, gasoline, other basic necessities are all appreciated.

Volunteer at the farm if you are local and have time/energy. This campaign takes time away from the farm, and the farm still needs a lot of work to recover from this spring's upheaval.






What You Get

You'll become a member of Pinwheel Farm's Community of Life, forever! No matter how small your donation, you'll be honored on the Helping Hands wall of the Brown Barn. We'll list you as a donor on Pinwheel's website (unless you want to remain anonymous, or make a donation in honor of someone else). You'll be a Pinwheel VIP! Hopefully you'll be able to visit the farm in person and enjoy its quiet beauty, yummy veggies, entertaining animals, fascinating wildlife, and interesting people.
Moderate (by my pinch-penny standards) donations will get you great Pinwheel Farm products, discounts, and promotional items...there's something for everyone.
Larger donations will get you even more wonderful perks. By sponsoring a sheep or a tree, you'll feel a very special, unique connection with the farm for years to come. Participating in special events at the farm will bring you and your friends even closer to the farm's Community of Life.
Want to donate, don't see a perk that appeals to you, and have an idea for something else I could offer? Contact me!
The Impact


Paying off this contract will have far-reaching benefits beyond me and the farm. 

The farm will be able to support itself, me, and others as well. I'll be free to increase my mission to teach farming and sustainable living skills to people of all ages; continue developing special low-input gardening methods to ensure future food production ""no matter what""; breed low-maintenance sheep that provide meat, wool and milk with just pasture and hay; enrich others' lives with opportunities to experience the natural ecosystem that's replaced the once-barren cornfield; welcome visitors to explore and relax in this rural haven that's just 3 blocks from a city transit route; navigate the challenges of an increasingly unstable climate; write about and photograph the wonders and lessons of the farm and share them through blogs and booklets.
The farm and its vast, complex Community of Life will be safe from nearly all risk of development. As of 2000, we had identified nearly 500 naturally-occuring species of living things here; I know there are hundreds more by now. We see new ones every year. The trees will continue to benefit our entire community through shade, screening of industrial areas, air purification, oxygen production, and more. Myriad bird species will sing, forage, raise their families, migrate through. The rich diversity of insects will thrive in a healthier balance each year. Frogs, turtles, snakes, foxes, and many other animals will delight us with their presence.

We live in a world in crisis, with increasing CO2 levels, unstable global weather patterns, GMOs, bee die-offs, Fukushima radiation headed this way, water shortages, worsening economy, etc. Pinwheel has been designed since its very beginning to make a positive difference in our environment, both ecological and social.
Pinwheel provides:



Food security, in so many ways--With the help of so many mentors and volunteers, I grow healthy, nutritious food with a minimum of off-farm inputs, using a minimum of fossil fuels. We sell it directly to eaters whenever possible. We make generous donations to local food banks (Just Foods). We grow more and more of our own seed. We provide perennial plant starts to others. We teach farming and gardening skills and knowledge, and even food storage and preparation ideas. We answer questions, we coach, we mentor. Relentlessly, whenever we are called to do so.


An ark for many creatures--It's been amazing to watch the ecology of the farm become more diverse every year as the formerly plowed land recovers a natural balance. We try to be attentive to the needs of our precious pollinator friends by managing crops, pasture, and fallow areas especially for bees, butterflies, and other beneficials. This means the farm isn't always as tidy as it could be...but we are well compensated by the beauty of our non-human residents and visitors.



Sustainable farming research and development--My farming methods have been developed through on-farm experiments and observations as well as continuing education opportunities and extensive reading. I continue to refine these techniques and systems to reduce the environmental impact of food production at Pinwheel, while improving yields. My methods are guided by this particular microclimate and soil, but also influenced by permaculture principles and farming/gardening greats such as Joel Salatin, Helen and Scott Nearing, Ruth Stout, Gene Logsdon, Masanobu Fukuoka, Wes Jackson, and many others.  Key areas of ongoing experimentation include use of natural plant-based mulches to manage soil moisture, temperature and fertility; techniques for producing vegetables in an extreme climate without irrigation; and use of Mulberry trees as a drought-tolerant sheep forage to replace soon-to-be-GMO alfalfa.






Freedom of information--We don't charge for sharing what we've learned, because so many people have been so generous in sharing their knowledge with me throughout the years. Workshops and seminars are presented on a donation basis. The farm would not exist today without the tireless help of many mentors and consultants who asked only that I share what they gave me. I ask only that those who come to the farm to learn will teach others in the same way. By spreading knowledge freely, we all benefit.




Sustainable life training--So many basic daily skills that I learned as a child or even later in life are all but lost to today's younger generations. Yet some of these skills may be essential to coping with today's changing climate and economy. I'm committed to passing on the things I've learned over the years, like efficient clothesline use, making homemade soap, sweeping a rug, using human powered tools, and keeping house without toxic chemicals.
Opportunities--I try to meet each person where they're at, and help them towards their spiritual and sustainable living goals. If someone is drawn to the farm, I try to find a way for them to make a positive difference. Both on and off the farm, I've worked for many years with people with diverse lifestyles, identities, beliefs, and abilities. I learn and grow from everyone who chooses to participate in the farm, even if it's just a quick visit; it's always a two-way street.






""Farmercise""--Volunteering at the farm is a great affordable alternative to going to the gym, and has many additional social and physical benefits. Volunteers enjoy the serenity of the farm, fresh air, sunshine, and activities to fit a wide range of abilities and interests. The sense of community gained from working together with others to complete a task contributes to a sense of well-being and self-esteem. 









Spiritual retreat--Pinwheel is a place to put the rat race at arm's length for an hour or a day, and heal our spirits through connecting with nature. There are special places around the farm set aside especially for meditation, or people can find their own special spot. All faiths are welcome here. 



Local regulatory and policy development--My consulting background (DPRA Incorporated, 1987 - 1992) prepared me well for this particular farm and community. I was involved in the development of Lawrence's Natural Landscaping Ordinance and regulations allowing backyard poultry, as well as Douglas County's Agritourism regulations, and the City/County Northeast Sector Plan. In 2009, I was honored at the Pioneers of Local Foods event for helping open the way for locally grown meat to be sold at the DowntownLawrence Farmer's Market (blog article on Pioneers of Local Foods). 



Carbon sequestration--We maintain a very small carbon footprint through energy conservation. We also incorporate many practices that maximize carbon sequestration at the farm, including permanent pasture and tree plantings, use of wood chips instead of gravel for lanes and paths, and natural decomposition of brush piles instead of burning.
I could go on, but you get the idea. Pinwheel is pretty amazing, and pretty complex.
History, the Short Version


My current situation didn't just happen out of nowhere, either the blessings or the challenges. Like the scarab in the video, I've been hard at it for a long time, learning and working:
1960 (age 3): First accurate bird ID (""Mommy, mommy, there really IS a Tufted Titmouse in that tree down the path!"") marks the beginning of my lifetime love affair with ""God and Mother Nature"". 1975: I have a vision of a small farm, simple lifestyle, sheep. 1978-1995: Don't think I'd ever be able to achieve that dream, but keep finding little pieces of the puzzle along my life journey. 
1992: Design the imaginary ""Pinwheel Farm"" as a paper for a Vegetable Crop Production class in college. 1994: Move to Lawrence and marry; buy what is now the Pinwheel Farmhouse along with another house that we rented out. 1995: Neighbor offers to sell us the 10 acres behind us. We cash in everything we have to buy it (I now own it free and clear). 1996: A series of serendipitous connections brings me sheep, then a Border Collie, then a guardian llama. I realize God has commissioned me to build a modern-day ""Noah's Ark""--a place of refuge for the natural Community of Life displaced by surrounding urban development. 
*Misfortunes begin: 1997: Devastating fire at our tenant's house. 1998: Divorce. 2001-2003: ""Friend"" leaves me with significant credit card debt. 
*Misfortunes continue: 2004-6: Tenants renting the farm/farmhouse during my sabbatical trash the house and cause over $23,000 damages to farm infrastructure, putting me deeper in debt. Meanwhile, the voluntary service agency I'm working through suffers an internal upheaval and ""fires"" me, leaving me homeless and jobless in Canada (I had a great time anyhow!). More debt accrues. 2006: Back at the farm, I drive a transit bus full-time while rebuilding the farm and paying off debts. 2007: Another neighbor offers to sell me, on contract, the acre next door--a great opportunity, but more debt. 2007-2010: Keep driving the bus (great Lawrence Journal World article and video about my double life as a farmer/bus driver), pay down debts, build the farm, operate the farm. 2010- 2012: Farm is back on track; suddenly it's time to start renovating the little house--including structural work and a whole new plumbing system that I design and build myself. 
*Big season of misfortunes: April 2012: When we should be doing spring planting, the farmhouse well which supplies the whole farm fails, and my apprentices and I spend a month dealing with extremely limited water while rebuilding the entire well/pump system ourselves. Early May 2012: Worst lambing season ever, with deformed lambs and lots of bottle babies requiring round the clock care. Veterinary mystery--possible new virus due to climate change? Late May 2012: Fired for making a split-second decision to not risk lives; denied unemployment. I decide to keep my commitments to apprentices who are living at the farm rent-free in exchange for learning and working; no rent to help pay the bills = more debt. Summer 2012: Record high temperatures and extreme drought reduced farm income; hay prices sky rocket. Fall 2012: Both apprentices drop out before the end of the season, leaving me unexpectedly short handed.
*Even bigger misfortune: November 2012: New tenant/co-farmer makes a commitment to jointly operate the farm with me for the rest of my life. Winter 2013: We plan the partnership, start rearranging the farm as a two-person enterprise, and jump through a bunch of regulatory hurdles to get permits for new infrastructure.

Summer 2013: Full-blown financial crisis results when I can't find new tenant for the Farmhouse. 
Moving forward: The Pinwheel Farmhouse suddenly has wonderful new tenants as of Sept. 1, significantly stabilizing the farm's financial situation. This incredibly energetic family of 4 plans to be a long-term part of Pinwheel. Unexpectedly, the Embers family offered to generously discount the remaining debt on the acre (the woods, the small house, and the brown barn) if I can pay them $25,000 by October 8, 2013. 
Now: Here's where you come into the picture. It can be your farm, too. You can be part of the Pinwheel story. Just make a donation and pick a perk!

</div></div>","Short Summary
Rose Tasker is a scientist, humanitarian, explorer, writer, musician, and artist from Tasmania, Australia. With a reputation for generating endless ideas and getting overly passionate about her work. Rose is one of those crazy people who believes we can make the world a better place and preserve what is already wonderful.
Rose has been selected as part of the 2041 International Antarctic Expedition and Antarctic Youth Ambassadors Program.
In 2014 Rose will join explorer Robert Swan and other young people from around the globe and venture to the Antarctic continent to explore the fragility of this important wilderness.
The expedition costs in excess of $22000 and Rose is seeking your help to raise the funds. 


What We Need & What You Get
Antarctica isn't cheap. To make the expedition a reality a fundraising goal has been set at $22000. 
There are some pretty cool things available if you donate certain amounts, have a look at some of the donation options. You can of course donate as little or as much as you like, even if it is not a listed amount.


The Impact
In its second year, the Antarctic Youth Ambassador Programme consists of young people selected from across the globe, AYAP Ambassadors will participate in the AYAP skills and capacity programme. Beginning the expedition with a goal in mind, Amabassadors will focus on developing an on-ground environmental project with youth-based curriculum. Using a combination of the Antarctic’s inspiration and newfound skills, Ambassadors will return home to implement a personalized yearlong project within their region; ultimately, inspiring positive ongoing change.IAE 2014 Team Members will be sharing their adventures via the 2041 expedition website, updated daily from the field using the latest in satellite technology and digital media. Through photos and blog posts, the team will share their physical and emotional impressions of the Antarctic in real-time. The team’s global audience will vicariously experience the adventure with cutting-edge immediacy.Rose on the ExpeditionCamera, notebook, sketchbook, pencils, and remote technology in hand Rose has several goals during the expedition. These include, but are not limited to:

Collection of natural history illustrations from the Antarctic continent
Video 'architecture' projection on the polar landscape (first ever on the Antarctic continent, will be filmed for exhibition purposes)
Collection of photographs depiction the continents uniqueness and importance, but also evidence of anthropogenic impacts and challenges
Collecting scientific observational data on anthropogenic impacts on the continent, including dark snow, marine debris, climate change, and wildlife impacts
Documentary and landscape filming of Antarctica, to be screened publicly post-exhibition
The development of education programs to be implemented in Australian/Tasmanian schools
Collection of writings - poetry, prose, articles, essays, and thoughts
The development of an interactive website and/or computer game/app

There will be a number of post-expedition events to engage the wider public with the Antarctic continent and today's sustainability and environmental challenges. These may include workshops, lectures, festivals and events. Rose will also be engaging with young people on her return to assist in training and enhancing the capacity of young leaders.Rose is particularly interested in working with Australian organisations in developing related projects. Projects may include curation of exhibitions, lectures, workshops, educations programs, or digital media projects.

<br/><h3 style=""color: #C7120A;"">About us</h3>Compost Montreal has blossomed from a bicycle and trailer collection into a dedicated team of 15 people. We serve <b>nearly 750 residents and 100 businesses and institutions</b>, such as schools, restaurants, and offices. Many of our clients are as passionate as we are about reducing the environmental impact of the waste they produce. Together, we divert around<b> 700 tonnes of organic waste from landfills </b>every year, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by about 1,750,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually. That’s about the same 
impact as taking 900 cars off the road!<br/><br/>We are a social 
entreprise, one with strong <b>environmental and social purpose </b>to 
everything we do. We believe that a very powerful way to create real positive change to the way our economy impacts the world is to build a
 viable business while doing something that is good. There is a strong market of people out there who are voting with their dollar and supporting businesses that are <b>making the world a better place</b>.<br/><br/>We are currently pursuing a certification as a <a href=""http://www.bcorporation.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">'B' Corp</a>,  a model that is much more common in the U.S. and has a pretty strict protocol for balancing 'people, planet, and profits', to always be trying to satisfy a '<b>triple bottom line</b>'. We have been working to reach these goals for the past 7 years, and so far have always made just enough to pay ourselves and keep our pickup trucks in working order. <br/><br/>We are the <b>only access that many Montrealers have to composting</b>, as the official plan for a city-wide residential collection is not expected to take effect before 2019. <br/><br/><h3 style=""color: #C7120A;"">Our Challenge</h3>
Our local compost site, run by the South-West borough, is <b>the only site that makes agricultural-grade compost</b> within an hour of Montreal. However, a nearby major roadwork project from the Ministry of Transportation has pressured the South-West borough to transform the compost site into a storage area for its equipment. <b>Thanks to the support of thousands of citizens</b>, and the goodwill of the South-West borough, the closure has been postponed by several months.<br/><br/>While attempts are still being made to keep the site open, the possibility of its closure is still very real, and the site could now close at any moment. <br/><br/>Here is a video of the site in action: <br/><div>
<br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F88084365&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F88084365%2B&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F466841925_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>There are no other compost sites near the city of Montreal, so the closure of this compost site would <b>put our project in serious jeopardy</b>. Setting up a new compost site will take some time, considering the work required and the process of obtaining the necessary permits. That's why we've launched this campaign now: To help raise some money in order to <b>develop a 
new site</b> and keep composting, no matter what may come. This will allow us to continue to make our social and environmental contribution through the work that we do.<p><br/></p>
<h3 style=""color: #C7120A;"">What we need</h3>Since being told that our local compost site was going to close, and looking around only to find a lack of real alternatives, we have realized that the only real solution to the situation is <b>to open our own compost site</b>. The next-closest compost site that makes agricultural-grade compost is over an hour away from Montreal, and charges a great deal for the food waste it receives. We want to <b>continue to compost as locally as possible</b>,  as economically and as ecologically as possible, and we want to keep providing the community with great quality finished compost for growing food in the city.<br/><br/>We have met with a number of groups - like the 
folks at the <a href=""www.valhallamovement.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://valhallamovement.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Valhalla Movement</a> - who recognize the value of 
compost and have been helping us in our quest to set up a new site. A 
number of great options are available for locations to set up a site, 
but of course it will take a significant amount of money <b>to pay for plans, development, and equipment</b>.<br/><br/>We need your help <b>to raise $200,000</b> to develop a new site. We will use this money to:<br/><br/>
<p>- Continue the <b>research and development</b> for our site, including engineer consulting, planning, and permitting.
</p>
<p>- <b>Upgrade to cost-effective higher-capacity trucks and convert them</b>
 to run on used vegetable oil, which we’ve already begun collecting, 
filtering, and testing. This is a great way to cut pollution and cost 
while doing our collection runs and transporting the food waste for treatment while we set up our new site. Once our new site is 
ready these trucks will still be perfect for the job!
</p>
<p>- <b>Purchase the essential equipment we will need to get started,</b> most importantly a tractor. <br/></p>
<p>- If the South-West borough needs funding help that we can provide to keep their compost site open, <b>we will gladly contribute</b> what we can to their site's success and survival. <br/></p>
<br/>
<h3 style=""color: #C7120A;"">What's next?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are working on partnerships with <b>groups that would like us to create and operate a compost site on land that is already available</b>,
 and doesn’t need to be purchased. This will help keep the cost of our 
project reasonable, as land is obviously a significant expense. And 
yet there is so much food waste produced in the City of Montreal - and 
such a need for finished compost to grow new food - that we will eventually be
 looking to buy land in order to meet this demand. Once our crowdfunding
 campaign is done, <b>we will begin preparing for environmental-impact investment</b> in order to raise more funds that will allow us to further develop our model for sustainable composting and help Montrealers compost more of their waste.  <br/></p>
<p>What is an impact investment? ""Impact investments are investments made into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to <b>generate social and 
environmental impact</b> alongside a financial return.""

<p>Only about 10-15% of organic waste generated in Montreal is presently being composted, and the rest is still going to landfill. While the city of Montreal does have plans for city-wide residential 
organic waste collection by 2019, it will not include collection for 
commercial and institutional clients such as restaurants and schools, so
 <b>there will always be a vast amount of food waste available </b>for us to make our own high-quality compost.</p>
<p><b>Help Montreal compost by helping Compost Montreal!</b> We appreciate your support and we hope to see you at our new compost site sometime soon!</p>

<h3>How Compost Montreal Began</h3>
<p>Compost Montreal was <b>started in July of 2007 with just a bike and
 a trailer.</b> Stephen McLeod knew that when food waste goes in the 
garbage, it ends up in landfills, which creates greenhouse gases that 
contribute enormously to global warming and climate change. He also knew
 that <b>compost is nature’s way of enriching the soil</b> to grow new food, 
and that the chemical fertilizers we use are slowly destroying our soil 
and polluting the environment.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1029974/files/20141119125112-CM_First_Run_Ever.jpg?1416430272"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Montreal had no municipal organic 
waste collection service, so Stephen decided to do something about it. 
He began picking up food waste from his neighbours, using a trailer 
attached to the back of his bike, and taking it to a nearby small-scale 
composter run by the environmental group Éco-Quartier. Stephen soon 
discovered that the <b>South-West borough of Montreal</b>, (where he still 
lives and where our office is still based) was running a <b>medium-scale 
compost site just down the road</b>. He approached them about adding the 
nutrient-rich food waste he was picking up, and they agreed! With that, 
Compost Montreal was born.  <br/></p>
<br/>
<h3 style=""color: #C7120A;"">About the South-West compost site</h3>
<p>We have been incredibly fortunate to have had access to this site for the past 7 years. It is located just 5 minutes from our office and <b>only 6 kilometres from downtown Montreal</b>, which is truly <b>an amazing resource for a city</b> to have and something you just don’t find anywhere else. </p>
<p>Due to space concerns related to the demolition of the Turcot Interchange, a major piece of downtown highway infrastructure, the South-West borough <b>recently announced a plan to shut down the compost operations at this site</b> in order to use the space as storage for roadwork equipment.</p>
<p>Thanks to the support of thousands of petition signers, and the reluctance of the South-West borough to actually close their site, (a source of pride for the borough, and <b>the only one of its kind anywhere near Montreal</b>, in operation now for over 20 years) the closure has been delayed by a few months. We have been working with the borough to try to keep the site open and operating in some capacity, something they would like to be able to do. <br/></p>
<p>However, the borough is in a tough position, and while there is still hope, the situation is complicated and there is a real possibility that the site will have to close in the very near future. While it would break our hearts, and there is no replacing such an incredible resource - both to the city itself and of course to our own operations - we are determined to keep composting, and believe that<b> with your help, we can turn this crisis into an opportunity.</b></p>
We certainly hope that the South-West compost site never shuts down. But we now know that in order to guarantee the future of our project, and to keep helping Montrealers to compost, we need to open another site.<br/><br/>
<h3 style=""color: #C7120A;"">About food waste and compost</h3>
<p>When food waste is sent to landfill it is layered with all kinds of garbage, and breaks down without oxygen. This causes it to release <b>large amounts of methane</b> (a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than CO2), leach out toxic liquids, and sometimes take decades to break down completely. Keeping food waste separate from garbage and letting it compost properly with oxygen allows it to transform into nutrient-rich compost in a year or less!</p>
<p>Compost is a fantastic soil amendment that repairs and enriches soil, eliminating the need for environmentally-damaging petroleum-based synthetic products to grow food. So, not only does <b>composting your food waste avoid greenhouse gas emissions</b>, it also <b>creates rich soil</b> that can be used to grow new food!</p>
<p>Only about 10-15% of the food waste produced in Montreal is presently being composted, and the other 90% is still going to landfill. We want to help keep more and more of it out of landfills and turn it into high quality compost.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 style=""color: #C7120A;"">What is Responsible Solutions?</h3>
<p>After a few years collecting compost, <b>we created a parent company</b> called Responsible Solutions that could launch new socially and environmentally responsible projects. So far we have created <a href=""http://biomobile.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BioMobile</a>, an online grocery store with delivery that focuses on organic, local, fair-trade, and other sustainable products. We've just recently switched to a new website, but the whole project is presently on hold (though you can still order Green Pasture cod liver oil) while we address the present situation at Compost Montreal. You can always visit the site and send us a message to let us know if this service would be of interest to you.</p>
<p>We have also developed a <b>used vegetable oil</b> collection service for our restaurant clients at Compost Montreal. The oil we collect is used to create biodiesel, fuel our trucks, and help to reduce fossil-fuel consumption.</p>
<p>There are lots of other social and environmental projects that we want to develop and support. But the most important way to guarantee the future of these projects is to <b>make sure that Compost Montreal</b> - our most important project, and the one that started it all - <b>can survive and thrive</b>, even through this turbulent time. </p>
<p>And for that, we need your help...<br/>

<h3 style=""color: #C7120A;"">À propos de nous</h3>Compost Montréal est devenu - d'une simple collecte à vélo avec une remorque - une équipe dédiée de 15 personnes. Nous servons près de <b>750 clients résidentiels, et une centaine de commerces et institutions</b> (écoles, restaurants, et bureaux). Beaucoup de nos clients sont aussi passionnés que nous par la réduction de l’impact environnemental des déchets qu’ils produisent. E<span style=""background-color: initial;"">nsemble </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">c</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">haque année,</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> nous détournons </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">environ 700 tonnes de matière organique</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> des sites d’enfouissement, ce qui équivaut à réduire </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">annuellement les émissions de gaz à effet de serre de 1,750,000 tonnes de CO2 . C’est le même impact que retirer <b>900 voitures de la route!<br/></b></span>
</div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>
<div>
<p>Nous sommes une entreprise sociale, avec de solides <b>engagements sociaux et environnementaux</b> que nous appliquons à tout ce que nous faisons. Nous croyons qu'un moyen efficace de faire évoluer la façon dont l’économie actuelle fonctionne est de montrer aux gens qu’il est possible de construire un projet d’entreprise viable en faisant quelque chose de bien. Il y a un vaste marché de gens qui sont prêts à voter avec leur argent, en soutenant les entreprises qui travaillent à <b>créer un monde meilleur</b>.</p>Nous sommes actuellement en train de poursuivre la <a href=""http://www.bcorporation.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">certification ‘B corp’</a>, un modèle plus commun aux États Unis, avec un protocole assez strict afin d'arriver au<b> bon équilibre entre “les gens, la planète et les profits”</b>, toujours dans le but d’atteindre une durabilité à triple résultats (triple bottom-line). Depuis 7 ans maintenant, nous travaillons à atteindre ces buts, et nous avons toujours fait juste assez d'argent pour nous payer et pour garder nos camions pickup en bon état. <b>Nous sommes le seul accès qu’ont beaucoup de Montréalais au compostage</b>, puisque le plan officiel pour une collecte globale pour la ville de Montréal ne prendra normalement effet qu'en 2019.<br/><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""color: #C7120A;"">Notre défi</h3>
<p><span>Le site de compostage de l'arrondissement Sud-Ouest, qui reçoit depuis 7 ans la matière organique que nous collectons, est <b>le seul site qui produit du compost de qualité agricole</b> dans un rayon d'une heure autour de Montréal. Cependant, un projet de travaux routiers majeur, initié par le Ministère des Transports, fait pression sur l'arrondissement pour transformer le site de compostage en une aire d'entreposage d'équipement. <b>Grâce au soutien de milliers de citoyens</b>, et à la bonne volonté de l'arrondissement, la fermeture a été reportée de plusieurs mois.</span></p>
<p>Malgré les tentatives mises en place pour garder le site ouvert, la possibilité de fermeture demeure réelle, et le site pourrait fermer à tout moment. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Ci-dessous une vidéo du site en action: <br/></p>
<p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F88084365&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F88084365%2B&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F466841925_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>Il n'y en a aucun autre site de compostage dans la région du Grand Montréal, donc la fermeture du site mettrait notre projet en grand danger. Démarrer un nouveau site de compostage prendra du temps, considérant le travail nécessaire ainsi que le processus d'obtention des permis requis. C'est pour cette raison que nous avons lancé cette campagne maintenant: Pour nous aider à récolter des fonds afin de <b>développer un nouveau site de compostage </b>et continuer à composter, peu importe ce qui arrivera. Ceci nous permettra de continuer à faire notre part sociale et environnementale à travers le travail que nous effectuons. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<br/>
<h3 style=""color: #C7120A;"">Ce dont nous avons besoin </h3>Depuis l'annonce initiale de la fermeture de notre site de compostage local, nous avons cherché des alternatives et, avons alors réalisé que la seule véritable solution serait de développer <b>un nouveau site de compostage</b>. Après le site du sud-ouest, le prochain site qui produit du compost de qualité agricole le plus proche est situé à plus d’une heure de route de Montréal, et applique des frais importants pour les résidus alimentaires qu’il reçoit. Nous voulons <b>continuer à composter aussi localement, économiquement et écologiquement que possible</b>, et nous voulons continuer à fournir à la population un compost d’excellente qualité qui permettra de cultiver dans la ville. <br/><br/>Nous avons rencontré de nombreux groupes, comme les gens du <a href=""http://valhallamovement.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mouvement Valhalla</a>, qui reconnaissent la valeur du compost et nous aident dans notre quête; celle de développer un nouveau site de compostage. Un bon nombre d’options intéressantes est disponible quant aux lieux où nous pourrions établir notre site mais ceci demande, bien sur, des sommes importantes afin de pouvoir financer les plans d'aménagement, le développement, et l'équipement. </div>
<div>Nous avons besoin de <b>votre aide pour récolter $200,000</b> afin de développer notre nouveau site. Nous utiliserons cet argent pour : <br/><br/>- Continuer la <b>recherche et le développement</b> du nouveau site, ce qui comprend des ingénieurs-conseils, plans et permis.<br/><br/>- <b>Améliorer la rentabilité de nos camions</b>, en augmentant leur capacité, et en les convertissant à l’huile végétale usée/biodiésel, que nous avons déjà commencé à collecter, filtrer et tester. C’est un excellent moyen pour réduire nos émissions de polluants et nos coûts, tout en continuant à collecter et à transporter les résidus alimentaires pour le traitement, pendant que nous développons un nouveau site. Une fois que notre site sera prêt, ces camions seront toujours parfaitement adaptés!<br/><br/>- <b>Acheter l’équipement qui nous est essentiel</b> pour commencer les opérations sur le nouveau site, le plus important étant d’acheter un tracteur.<br/><br/>- Si l'arrondissement du sud-ouest a besoin de soutien financièr afin de garder ouvert leur site de compostage, nous ferons notre possible pour <b>contribuer de cette façon à la survie et succès de leur site</b>.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div style="""">
<h3 style=""color: #C7120A;"">Qu'arrive t-il après?</h3>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>Nous travaillons actuellement sur un partenariat avec<b> des groupes qui souhaitent que nous créerions un site de compostage sur des terrains qui sont d’ores et déjà disponibles</b> et qui n’ont pas besoin d’être achetés. Cela aidera à maintenir les coûts de notre projet à un niveau minimum, puisque que le terrain représente, bien sur, une dépense considérable. Et pourtant, il y a tellement de résidus alimentaires produits par la ville de Montréal, et un tel besoin en compost fini pour pouvoir cultiver des aliments sains, que nous chercherons éventuellement à procurer un autre terrain pour pouvoir véritablement répondre à la demande. Une fois que cette campagne de levée de fonds sera terminée, nous commençerons à<b> </b>se préparer pour de<b> investissement d’impact environnemental, </b>dans le but de récolter davantage de fonds afin de continuer à développer notre modèle de compostage durable.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<p>Qu'est-ce que c'est l'investissement d'impact? <i>""Les investissements d'impact sont des montants placés dans des sociétés, des organismes et des fonds dans le but de <b>produire un impact social et environnemental</b> mesurable parallèlement à leur rendement financier.</i>"" <br/>(<a href=""http://www.thegiin.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.thegiin.org/cgi-bin/iowa/home/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thegiin.org</a>, <a href=""http://www.mcconnellfoundation.ca/fr/programs/social-finance/impact-investing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.mcconnellfoundation.ca/fr/</a>)</p>
<p>Seulement 10-15% de la matière organique générée par les citoyens de la Ville de Montréal est présentement compostée, et le reste se retrouve toujours dans les dépotoirs. La Ville ne planifie pas d’offrir de collecte résidentielle de la matière organique à travers toute la ville avant 2019, et même à ce moment là, il n’y aura pas de collecte organisée pour les commerces, entreprises, écoles et institutions. Il y aura donc toujours un approvisionnement abondant de matière organique à composter sur notre site.</p>

<br/><h3>Comment nous avons commencé<br/>
</h3>
<br/><p>Compost Montréal est <b>né en juillet 2007 avec un vélo et une remorque</b>.
 Stephen McLeod savait que lorsque les résidus alimentaires vont à la 
poubelle, ils finissent dans des sites d’enfouissement, causant la 
création de gaz à effet de serre connus pour leurs rôles dans le 
réchauffement et les changements climatiques. Il savait aussi que le<b> compost est un moyen naturel d’enrichir le sol </b>afin
 de cultiver de la nouvelle nourriture, et que les engrais chimiques que nous utilisons 
sont doucement en train de détruire notre sol et de polluer notre 
environnement.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1030019/files/20141119125833-CM_First_Run_Ever.jpg?1416430713"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Montréal n’avait pas de service municipal de collecte 
de résidus alimentaires, donc Stephen décida d’agir. Il commença par 
récupérer les résidus alimentaires de ses voisins, en utilisant une 
remorque attachée à l’arrière de son vélo, puis il les déposait dans une
 compostière à petite échelle, mise en place par le groupe 
environnemental Éco-Quartier. Stephen découvrit assez vite que <b>l’arrondissement du sud-ouest de Montréal</b> (où il vit toujours et où nos bureaux sont situés) exploitait <b>un site de compostage à moyenne échelle</b> dans
 le même secteur. Il leur proposa d’ajouter les résidus alimentaires 
riches en nutriments qu’il récoltait, et ils ont accepté! C’est comme 
cela que Compost Montréal est né.<br/><br/>
</div>
<h3 style=""color: #C7120A;"">À propos du site de compostage du sud-ouest</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Nous avons été incroyablement chanceux d’avoir eu accès à ce site pendant les 7 dernières années. Il est situé à 5 minutes de nos bureaux et seulement <b>6 kilomètres du centre ville de Montréal</b>, ce qui en fait <b>une extraordinaire ressource pour la ville</b>, quelque chose qui ne peut être trouvé nulle part ailleurs.</p>
<p>Faisant face à des problèmes d’espace liés à la démolition de l’échangeur Turcot (une partie importante de l’infrastructure de l’autoroute du centre-ville), l’arrondissement Sud-ouest a <b>récemment annoncé l'arrêt de ses activités de compostage</b>, afin de transformer l'espace utilisé en aire d'entreposage pour les équipements de la voirie.<br/><br/>Grâce au soutien de milliers de citoyens, et à la réticence de l’arrondissement du Sud-ouest de fermer leur site, (une grande fierté pour l'arrondissment et <b>le seul dans son genre</b>, ouvert depuis plus de 20 ans) la fermeture a été reportée de quelques mois. Nous travaillons avec l’administration de l'arrondissement pour garder le site ouvert à une certaine capacité, mais l'arrondissement se trouve dans une position difficile et, même s'il reste de l'espoir, il y'a toujours possibilité que le site soit forcé de fermer dans un avenir très proche. Même si cela nous briserait le cœur, et qu’une telle ressource ne pourra jamais être remplacée, pour la ville ou pour nos opérations, nous sommes déterminés à continuer de composter, et nous pensons qu’avec votre aide, <b>nous pouvons transformer cette situation en une opportunité</b>. </p>
<p>Nous espérons que le site du sud-ouest reste ouvert pour toujours. Mais nous savons maintenant que pour garantir le futur de Compost Montréal et pour continuer à aider les Montréalais à composter, il faut ouvrir un nouveau site de compostage. <br/><br/></p>
<h3 style=""color: #C7120A;"">À propos des résidus alimentaires et du compost
</h3>Lorsque les résidus alimentaires sont envoyés à l’enfouissement, ils sont mélangés à différentes autres sortes de déchets, et se décomposent sans oxygène. Cela <b>provoque des émanations de méthane</b> (un gaz à effet de serre 25 fois plus puissant que le CO2), l’écoulement de liquide toxique, et des fois cela peut mettre des décennies à se décomposer complètement. Séparer les résidus alimentaires des autres déchets, et les laisser se composter correctement avec de l’oxygène permet de les <b>transformer en un compost riche en nutriments</b> en seulement une année ou moins. <br/><br/>Le compost est un fantastique amendement du sol qui répare et enrichie la terre, et élimine le besoin d’utiliser des produits synthétiques à base chimique, néfastes pour l’environnement et pour notre santé. Par conséquent, composter vos restes n’évite pas seulement <b>l’émission de gaz à effet de serre</b>, cela crée<b> aussi un sol plus riche</b>, qui peut être utilisé pour à nouveau faire pousser de la nourriture saine!<br/><br/><b>Seulement de 10-15% </b>des résidus alimentaires produits à Montréal sont actuellement compostés et le reste est toujours envoyé à l’enfouissement. Nous voulons aider à détourner de plus en plus de matière hors des sites d’enfouissement et à les transformer plutôt en un compost d’excellente qualité. </div>
<div>
<br/><h3 style=""color: #C7120A;"">À propos de Solutions Responsables</h3>Après quelques années de collecte de compost, nous avons créé une société mère, appelée Solutions Responsables, pour lancer de nouveaux projets socialement et environnementalement responsables. Pour l’instant, nous avons créé <a href=""http://biomobile.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BioMobile</a>, une épicerie en ligne avec service de livraison, axée sur des produits biologiques, locaux, et certifiés commerce équitable, et qui encourage un monde plus durable. Apart du fait que vous pouvez toujours comander de l'huile de foie de morue Green Pasture, le projet est autrement en pause pour que nous puissions nous consacrer entièrement à Compost Montréal. Vous pouvez toujours aller sur notre site web si vous le voulez et laisser vos coordonnées si l’idée d’un tel service vous intéresse.<br/><br/>Nous avons aussi développé <b>un programme de recyclage des huiles usées</b> pour les clients restaurateurs de Compost Montréal. L’huile que nous récoltons est utilisée pour fabriquer du biodiésel, alimenter nos camions, et réduire la dépendance sur les produits pétroliers. <br/><br/>Il y a une multitude d’autres projets sociaux et environnementaux que nous souhaiterions développer et soutenir mais le moyen le plus sûr pour garantir le futur de ces projets, c’est de <b>s’assurer que Compost Montréal</b>, notre projet le plus important et celui grâce auquel nous avons tout commencé, <b>peut survivre et continuer à se développer</b>, même durant cette période tumultueuse.<br/><br/>Et pour faire cela, nous avons besoin de vous!<br/><p></p>

#GROWTHEFUTUREHi! We’re Compost Montreal, a small business run by a dedicated team of environmental entrepreneurs for the past 7 years. We are the only access that many Montrealers have to composting, but we were recently told that our local compost site will soon be turned into a storage area for city equipment. There are no other compost sites anywhere near the city of Montreal, so the closure of this site would put our project in serious jeopardy. The goal of our fundraising campaign is to raise $200,000 to develop a new compost site in order to keep providing Montrealers with the ability to compost, preventing the release of huge amounts of greenhouse gas and creating rich new soil to grow new food, no matter what may come…This is a flexible funding campaign, so we will receive any contributions that are made. Thanks for your support! (To read more please see below... and if you have any questions please write to us at info@compostmontreal.com or visit us at www.compostmontreal.com)
Notre campagne en quelques mots
#CULTIVONSLAVENIRBonjour! Nous sommes Compost Montréal, une petite entreprise gérée par des entrepreneurs environnementaux depuis maintenant 7 ans. Nous sommes le seul accès qu’ont beaucoup de Montréalais au compostage mais nous avons été avertis récemment que notre site local de compostage sera transformé en aire d'entreposage d'équipement. Il n'y en a aucun autre site de compostage dans la grande région de Montréal, alors la fermeture du site mettrait notre projet en grand danger. 
Le but de cette campagne est de récolter $200,000, ce qui nous donnera la possibilité de développer un nouveau site de compostage afin de pouvoir continuer d'offrir aux Montréalais la possibilité de composter, peu importe ce qui arrive... 
Ceci est une campagne de financement flexible, alors nous reçevrons toute contribution que vous faites. Merci de votre soutien!

About usCompost Montreal has blossomed from a bicycle and trailer collection into a dedicated team of 15 people. We serve nearly 750 residents and 100 businesses and institutions, such as schools, restaurants, and offices. Many of our clients are as passionate as we are about reducing the environmental impact of the waste they produce. Together, we divert around 700 tonnes of organic waste from landfills every year, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by about 1,750,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually. That’s about the same 
impact as taking 900 cars off the road!We are a social 
entreprise, one with strong environmental and social purpose to 
everything we do. We believe that a very powerful way to create real positive change to the way our economy impacts the world is to build a
 viable business while doing something that is good. There is a strong market of people out there who are voting with their dollar and supporting businesses that are making the world a better place.We are currently pursuing a certification as a 'B' Corp,  a model that is much more common in the U.S. and has a pretty strict protocol for balancing 'people, planet, and profits', to always be trying to satisfy a 'triple bottom line'. We have been working to reach these goals for the past 7 years, and so far have always made just enough to pay ourselves and keep our pickup trucks in working order. We are the only access that many Montrealers have to composting, as the official plan for a city-wide residential collection is not expected to take effect before 2019. Our Challenge
Our local compost site, run by the South-West borough, is the only site that makes agricultural-grade compost within an hour of Montreal. However, a nearby major roadwork project from the Ministry of Transportation has pressured the South-West borough to transform the compost site into a storage area for its equipment. Thanks to the support of thousands of citizens, and the goodwill of the South-West borough, the closure has been postponed by several months.While attempts are still being made to keep the site open, the possibility of its closure is still very real, and the site could now close at any moment. Here is a video of the site in action: 



There are no other compost sites near the city of Montreal, so the closure of this compost site would put our project in serious jeopardy. Setting up a new compost site will take some time, considering the work required and the process of obtaining the necessary permits. That's why we've launched this campaign now: To help raise some money in order to develop a 
new site and keep composting, no matter what may come. This will allow us to continue to make our social and environmental contribution through the work that we do.
What we needSince being told that our local compost site was going to close, and looking around only to find a lack of real alternatives, we have realized that the only real solution to the situation is to open our own compost site. The next-closest compost site that makes agricultural-grade compost is over an hour away from Montreal, and charges a great deal for the food waste it receives. We want to continue to compost as locally as possible,  as economically and as ecologically as possible, and we want to keep providing the community with great quality finished compost for growing food in the city.We have met with a number of groups - like the 
folks at the Valhalla Movement - who recognize the value of 
compost and have been helping us in our quest to set up a new site. A 
number of great options are available for locations to set up a site, 
but of course it will take a significant amount of money to pay for plans, development, and equipment.We need your help to raise $200,000 to develop a new site. We will use this money to:
- Continue the research and development for our site, including engineer consulting, planning, and permitting.

- Upgrade to cost-effective higher-capacity trucks and convert them
 to run on used vegetable oil, which we’ve already begun collecting, 
filtering, and testing. This is a great way to cut pollution and cost 
while doing our collection runs and transporting the food waste for treatment while we set up our new site. Once our new site is 
ready these trucks will still be perfect for the job!

- Purchase the essential equipment we will need to get started, most importantly a tractor. 
- If the South-West borough needs funding help that we can provide to keep their compost site open, we will gladly contribute what we can to their site's success and survival. 

What's next?

We are working on partnerships with groups that would like us to create and operate a compost site on land that is already available,
 and doesn’t need to be purchased. This will help keep the cost of our 
project reasonable, as land is obviously a significant expense. And 
yet there is so much food waste produced in the City of Montreal - and 
such a need for finished compost to grow new food - that we will eventually be
 looking to buy land in order to meet this demand. Once our crowdfunding
 campaign is done, we will begin preparing for environmental-impact investment in order to raise more funds that will allow us to further develop our model for sustainable composting and help Montrealers compost more of their waste.  
What is an impact investment? ""Impact investments are investments made into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to generate social and 
environmental impact alongside a financial return."" (www.thegiin.org)
Only about 10-15% of organic waste generated in Montreal is presently being composted, and the rest is still going to landfill. While the city of Montreal does have plans for city-wide residential 
organic waste collection by 2019, it will not include collection for 
commercial and institutional clients such as restaurants and schools, so
 there will always be a vast amount of food waste available for us to make our own high-quality compost.
Help Montreal compost by helping Compost Montreal! We appreciate your support and we hope to see you at our new compost site sometime soon!

How Compost Montreal Began
Compost Montreal was started in July of 2007 with just a bike and
 a trailer. Stephen McLeod knew that when food waste goes in the 
garbage, it ends up in landfills, which creates greenhouse gases that 
contribute enormously to global warming and climate change. He also knew
 that compost is nature’s way of enriching the soil to grow new food, 
and that the chemical fertilizers we use are slowly destroying our soil 
and polluting the environment.



Montreal had no municipal organic 
waste collection service, so Stephen decided to do something about it. 
He began picking up food waste from his neighbours, using a trailer 
attached to the back of his bike, and taking it to a nearby small-scale 
composter run by the environmental group Éco-Quartier. Stephen soon 
discovered that the South-West borough of Montreal, (where he still 
lives and where our office is still based) was running a medium-scale 
compost site just down the road. He approached them about adding the 
nutrient-rich food waste he was picking up, and they agreed! With that, 
Compost Montreal was born.  

About the South-West compost site
We have been incredibly fortunate to have had access to this site for the past 7 years. It is located just 5 minutes from our office and only 6 kilometres from downtown Montreal, which is truly an amazing resource for a city to have and something you just don’t find anywhere else. 
Due to space concerns related to the demolition of the Turcot Interchange, a major piece of downtown highway infrastructure, the South-West borough recently announced a plan to shut down the compost operations at this site in order to use the space as storage for roadwork equipment.
Thanks to the support of thousands of petition signers, and the reluctance of the South-West borough to actually close their site, (a source of pride for the borough, and the only one of its kind anywhere near Montreal, in operation now for over 20 years) the closure has been delayed by a few months. We have been working with the borough to try to keep the site open and operating in some capacity, something they would like to be able to do. 
However, the borough is in a tough position, and while there is still hope, the situation is complicated and there is a real possibility that the site will have to close in the very near future. While it would break our hearts, and there is no replacing such an incredible resource - both to the city itself and of course to our own operations - we are determined to keep composting, and believe that with your help, we can turn this crisis into an opportunity.
We certainly hope that the South-West compost site never shuts down. But we now know that in order to guarantee the future of our project, and to keep helping Montrealers to compost, we need to open another site.
About food waste and compost
When food waste is sent to landfill it is layered with all kinds of garbage, and breaks down without oxygen. This causes it to release large amounts of methane (a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than CO2), leach out toxic liquids, and sometimes take decades to break down completely. Keeping food waste separate from garbage and letting it compost properly with oxygen allows it to transform into nutrient-rich compost in a year or less!
Compost is a fantastic soil amendment that repairs and enriches soil, eliminating the need for environmentally-damaging petroleum-based synthetic products to grow food. So, not only does composting your food waste avoid greenhouse gas emissions, it also creates rich soil that can be used to grow new food!
Only about 10-15% of the food waste produced in Montreal is presently being composted, and the other 90% is still going to landfill. We want to help keep more and more of it out of landfills and turn it into high quality compost.  

What is Responsible Solutions?
After a few years collecting compost, we created a parent company called Responsible Solutions that could launch new socially and environmentally responsible projects. So far we have created BioMobile, an online grocery store with delivery that focuses on organic, local, fair-trade, and other sustainable products. We've just recently switched to a new website, but the whole project is presently on hold (though you can still order Green Pasture cod liver oil) while we address the present situation at Compost Montreal. You can always visit the site and send us a message to let us know if this service would be of interest to you.
We have also developed a used vegetable oil collection service for our restaurant clients at Compost Montreal. The oil we collect is used to create biodiesel, fuel our trucks, and help to reduce fossil-fuel consumption.
There are lots of other social and environmental projects that we want to develop and support. But the most important way to guarantee the future of these projects is to make sure that Compost Montreal - our most important project, and the one that started it all - can survive and thrive, even through this turbulent time. 
And for that, we need your help...

À propos de nousCompost Montréal est devenu - d'une simple collecte à vélo avec une remorque - une équipe dédiée de 15 personnes. Nous servons près de 750 clients résidentiels, et une centaine de commerces et institutions (écoles, restaurants, et bureaux). Beaucoup de nos clients sont aussi passionnés que nous par la réduction de l’impact environnemental des déchets qu’ils produisent. Ensemble chaque année, nous détournons environ 700 tonnes de matière organique des sites d’enfouissement, ce qui équivaut à réduire annuellement les émissions de gaz à effet de serre de 1,750,000 tonnes de CO2 . C’est le même impact que retirer 900 voitures de la route!



Nous sommes une entreprise sociale, avec de solides engagements sociaux et environnementaux que nous appliquons à tout ce que nous faisons. Nous croyons qu'un moyen efficace de faire évoluer la façon dont l’économie actuelle fonctionne est de montrer aux gens qu’il est possible de construire un projet d’entreprise viable en faisant quelque chose de bien. Il y a un vaste marché de gens qui sont prêts à voter avec leur argent, en soutenant les entreprises qui travaillent à créer un monde meilleur.Nous sommes actuellement en train de poursuivre la certification ‘B corp’, un modèle plus commun aux États Unis, avec un protocole assez strict afin d'arriver au bon équilibre entre “les gens, la planète et les profits”, toujours dans le but d’atteindre une durabilité à triple résultats (triple bottom-line). Depuis 7 ans maintenant, nous travaillons à atteindre ces buts, et nous avons toujours fait juste assez d'argent pour nous payer et pour garder nos camions pickup en bon état. Nous sommes le seul accès qu’ont beaucoup de Montréalais au compostage, puisque le plan officiel pour une collecte globale pour la ville de Montréal ne prendra normalement effet qu'en 2019.

Notre défi
Le site de compostage de l'arrondissement Sud-Ouest, qui reçoit depuis 7 ans la matière organique que nous collectons, est le seul site qui produit du compost de qualité agricole dans un rayon d'une heure autour de Montréal. Cependant, un projet de travaux routiers majeur, initié par le Ministère des Transports, fait pression sur l'arrondissement pour transformer le site de compostage en une aire d'entreposage d'équipement. Grâce au soutien de milliers de citoyens, et à la bonne volonté de l'arrondissement, la fermeture a été reportée de plusieurs mois.
Malgré les tentatives mises en place pour garder le site ouvert, la possibilité de fermeture demeure réelle, et le site pourrait fermer à tout moment. 

Ci-dessous une vidéo du site en action: 

Il n'y en a aucun autre site de compostage dans la région du Grand Montréal, donc la fermeture du site mettrait notre projet en grand danger. Démarrer un nouveau site de compostage prendra du temps, considérant le travail nécessaire ainsi que le processus d'obtention des permis requis. C'est pour cette raison que nous avons lancé cette campagne maintenant: Pour nous aider à récolter des fonds afin de développer un nouveau site de compostage et continuer à composter, peu importe ce qui arrivera. Ceci nous permettra de continuer à faire notre part sociale et environnementale à travers le travail que nous effectuons. 



Ce dont nous avons besoin Depuis l'annonce initiale de la fermeture de notre site de compostage local, nous avons cherché des alternatives et, avons alors réalisé que la seule véritable solution serait de développer un nouveau site de compostage. Après le site du sud-ouest, le prochain site qui produit du compost de qualité agricole le plus proche est situé à plus d’une heure de route de Montréal, et applique des frais importants pour les résidus alimentaires qu’il reçoit. Nous voulons continuer à composter aussi localement, économiquement et écologiquement que possible, et nous voulons continuer à fournir à la population un compost d’excellente qualité qui permettra de cultiver dans la ville. Nous avons rencontré de nombreux groupes, comme les gens du Mouvement Valhalla, qui reconnaissent la valeur du compost et nous aident dans notre quête; celle de développer un nouveau site de compostage. Un bon nombre d’options intéressantes est disponible quant aux lieux où nous pourrions établir notre site mais ceci demande, bien sur, des sommes importantes afin de pouvoir financer les plans d'aménagement, le développement, et l'équipement. 
Nous avons besoin de votre aide pour récolter $200,000 afin de développer notre nouveau site. Nous utiliserons cet argent pour : - Continuer la recherche et le développement du nouveau site, ce qui comprend des ingénieurs-conseils, plans et permis.- Améliorer la rentabilité de nos camions, en augmentant leur capacité, et en les convertissant à l’huile végétale usée/biodiésel, que nous avons déjà commencé à collecter, filtrer et tester. C’est un excellent moyen pour réduire nos émissions de polluants et nos coûts, tout en continuant à collecter et à transporter les résidus alimentaires pour le traitement, pendant que nous développons un nouveau site. Une fois que notre site sera prêt, ces camions seront toujours parfaitement adaptés!- Acheter l’équipement qui nous est essentiel pour commencer les opérations sur le nouveau site, le plus important étant d’acheter un tracteur.- Si l'arrondissement du sud-ouest a besoin de soutien financièr afin de garder ouvert leur site de compostage, nous ferons notre possible pour contribuer de cette façon à la survie et succès de leur site.


Qu'arrive t-il après?


Nous travaillons actuellement sur un partenariat avec des groupes qui souhaitent que nous créerions un site de compostage sur des terrains qui sont d’ores et déjà disponibles et qui n’ont pas besoin d’être achetés. Cela aidera à maintenir les coûts de notre projet à un niveau minimum, puisque que le terrain représente, bien sur, une dépense considérable. Et pourtant, il y a tellement de résidus alimentaires produits par la ville de Montréal, et un tel besoin en compost fini pour pouvoir cultiver des aliments sains, que nous chercherons éventuellement à procurer un autre terrain pour pouvoir véritablement répondre à la demande. Une fois que cette campagne de levée de fonds sera terminée, nous commençerons à se préparer pour de investissement d’impact environnemental, dans le but de récolter davantage de fonds afin de continuer à développer notre modèle de compostage durable.


Qu'est-ce que c'est l'investissement d'impact? ""Les investissements d'impact sont des montants placés dans des sociétés, des organismes et des fonds dans le but de produire un impact social et environnemental mesurable parallèlement à leur rendement financier."" (www.thegiin.org, http://www.mcconnellfoundation.ca/fr/)
Seulement 10-15% de la matière organique générée par les citoyens de la Ville de Montréal est présentement compostée, et le reste se retrouve toujours dans les dépotoirs. La Ville ne planifie pas d’offrir de collecte résidentielle de la matière organique à travers toute la ville avant 2019, et même à ce moment là, il n’y aura pas de collecte organisée pour les commerces, entreprises, écoles et institutions. Il y aura donc toujours un approvisionnement abondant de matière organique à composter sur notre site.
Aidez Montréal à composter en aidant Compost Montréal! Nous apprécions votre soutien et nous espérons vous voir à notre nouveau site bientôt!

Comment nous avons commencé

Compost Montréal est né en juillet 2007 avec un vélo et une remorque.
 Stephen McLeod savait que lorsque les résidus alimentaires vont à la 
poubelle, ils finissent dans des sites d’enfouissement, causant la 
création de gaz à effet de serre connus pour leurs rôles dans le 
réchauffement et les changements climatiques. Il savait aussi que le compost est un moyen naturel d’enrichir le sol afin
 de cultiver de la nouvelle nourriture, et que les engrais chimiques que nous utilisons 
sont doucement en train de détruire notre sol et de polluer notre 
environnement.



Montréal n’avait pas de service municipal de collecte 
de résidus alimentaires, donc Stephen décida d’agir. Il commença par 
récupérer les résidus alimentaires de ses voisins, en utilisant une 
remorque attachée à l’arrière de son vélo, puis il les déposait dans une
 compostière à petite échelle, mise en place par le groupe 
environnemental Éco-Quartier. Stephen découvrit assez vite que l’arrondissement du sud-ouest de Montréal (où il vit toujours et où nos bureaux sont situés) exploitait un site de compostage à moyenne échelle dans
 le même secteur. Il leur proposa d’ajouter les résidus alimentaires 
riches en nutriments qu’il récoltait, et ils ont accepté! C’est comme 
cela que Compost Montréal est né.

À propos du site de compostage du sud-ouest

Nous avons été incroyablement chanceux d’avoir eu accès à ce site pendant les 7 dernières années. Il est situé à 5 minutes de nos bureaux et seulement 6 kilomètres du centre ville de Montréal, ce qui en fait une extraordinaire ressource pour la ville, quelque chose qui ne peut être trouvé nulle part ailleurs.
Faisant face à des problèmes d’espace liés à la démolition de l’échangeur Turcot (une partie importante de l’infrastructure de l’autoroute du centre-ville), l’arrondissement Sud-ouest a récemment annoncé l'arrêt de ses activités de compostage, afin de transformer l'espace utilisé en aire d'entreposage pour les équipements de la voirie.Grâce au soutien de milliers de citoyens, et à la réticence de l’arrondissement du Sud-ouest de fermer leur site, (une grande fierté pour l'arrondissment et le seul dans son genre, ouvert depuis plus de 20 ans) la fermeture a été reportée de quelques mois. Nous travaillons avec l’administration de l'arrondissement pour garder le site ouvert à une certaine capacité, mais l'arrondissement se trouve dans une position difficile et, même s'il reste de l'espoir, il y'a toujours possibilité que le site soit forcé de fermer dans un avenir très proche. Même si cela nous briserait le cœur, et qu’une telle ressource ne pourra jamais être remplacée, pour la ville ou pour nos opérations, nous sommes déterminés à continuer de composter, et nous pensons qu’avec votre aide, nous pouvons transformer cette situation en une opportunité. 
Nous espérons que le site du sud-ouest reste ouvert pour toujours. Mais nous savons maintenant que pour garantir le futur de Compost Montréal et pour continuer à aider les Montréalais à composter, il faut ouvrir un nouveau site de compostage. 
À propos des résidus alimentaires et du compost
Lorsque les résidus alimentaires sont envoyés à l’enfouissement, ils sont mélangés à différentes autres sortes de déchets, et se décomposent sans oxygène. Cela provoque des émanations de méthane (un gaz à effet de serre 25 fois plus puissant que le CO2), l’écoulement de liquide toxique, et des fois cela peut mettre des décennies à se décomposer complètement. Séparer les résidus alimentaires des autres déchets, et les laisser se composter correctement avec de l’oxygène permet de les transformer en un compost riche en nutriments en seulement une année ou moins. Le compost est un fantastique amendement du sol qui répare et enrichie la terre, et élimine le besoin d’utiliser des produits synthétiques à base chimique, néfastes pour l’environnement et pour notre santé. Par conséquent, composter vos restes n’évite pas seulement l’émission de gaz à effet de serre, cela crée aussi un sol plus riche, qui peut être utilisé pour à nouveau faire pousser de la nourriture saine!Seulement de 10-15% des résidus alimentaires produits à Montréal sont actuellement compostés et le reste est toujours envoyé à l’enfouissement. Nous voulons aider à détourner de plus en plus de matière hors des sites d’enfouissement et à les transformer plutôt en un compost d’excellente qualité. 

À propos de Solutions ResponsablesAprès quelques années de collecte de compost, nous avons créé une société mère, appelée Solutions Responsables, pour lancer de nouveaux projets socialement et environnementalement responsables. Pour l’instant, nous avons créé BioMobile, une épicerie en ligne avec service de livraison, axée sur des produits biologiques, locaux, et certifiés commerce équitable, et qui encourage un monde plus durable. Apart du fait que vous pouvez toujours comander de l'huile de foie de morue Green Pasture, le projet est autrement en pause pour que nous puissions nous consacrer entièrement à Compost Montréal. Vous pouvez toujours aller sur notre site web si vous le voulez et laisser vos coordonnées si l’idée d’un tel service vous intéresse.Nous avons aussi développé un programme de recyclage des huiles usées pour les clients restaurateurs de Compost Montréal. L’huile que nous récoltons est utilisée pour fabriquer du biodiésel, alimenter nos camions, et réduire la dépendance sur les produits pétroliers. Il y a une multitude d’autres projets sociaux et environnementaux que nous souhaiterions développer et soutenir mais le moyen le plus sûr pour garantir le futur de ces projets, c’est de s’assurer que Compost Montréal, notre projet le plus important et celui grâce auquel nous avons tout commencé, peut survivre et continuer à se développer, même durant cette période tumultueuse.Et pour faire cela, nous avons besoin de vous!

This is our pièce de resistance to recognize your contribution to our
 project. We will commission an artist to create a tree that will first be displayed at our office, and will ultimately be put on permanent display at our new 
compost site. It will be made  of wood, and is guaranteed to be a beautiful and powerful reminder of your contribution to the success of our project. The leaves, branches, and apples each 
indicate a different level of contribution.This is an example of the 'intarsia' technique, which is how we would like to build the tree.
Cet arbre sera notre chef d'oeuvre afin d'exposer aux yeux de tous votre participation à notre projet. Nous commanderons à un artiste la création de cet arbre qui sera tout d'abord exposé à nos bureaux puis, de façon permanente, sur notre nouveau site de compost. Il sera construit à partir du bois et constituera un magnifique et puissant rappel de votre contribution au succès de ce projet.

made the issue of global warming a recognized problem worldwide. Scientific
communities’ alarm about the melting polar ice caps and rising seawater levels initially
seemed unreal but hurricane Sandy, cyclone Phailin, recent typhoon in
Philippines, and many other natural disasters are a living proof of this grim
reality. We now know that climate change is <i>“REAL”</i>, environmental impact is <i>“SEVERE”</i>,
and the need of action is <i>“URGENT”</i>.</p>
<p>In this situation, one often asks – “What can I do to make a
difference?” I have my question answered in form of an incredible opportunity to travel to Antarctica to experience the last
great wilderness on earth and to learn how climate change is affecting it. I am
accepted as one of thirty young people from around the world into the <b><i>2014
Antarctica Youth Ambassadors Program (AYAP)</i></b> with Robert Swan and his company
2041.</p>
<p>Antarctica is the last great-untouched
wilderness on earth, and I cannot wait to go and experience it for myself. Yet
Antarctica is currently facing some of the worst effects of climate change, and
by attending this expedition I am going to learn the skills to be able to bring
back my knowledge and share it with my community. </p>
<p><b>Who am I?</b></p>
<p>My name is <b><i>Ashish Saxena</i></b> and I am a
32-year-old nature enthusiast from India. I am currently staying in Phoenix, Arizona,
USA for the past 5 years. I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Technology in
2004, majoring in Electronics Communication &amp; Renewable Energy. Currently I
am pursuing further studies in the field of Climate Change, Renewable Energy,
and Sustainability. </p>
<p>In 2012, I was selected for NREL’s Energy
Leadership Institute Program which saw me study and learn about renewable
energy and energy efficiency from experts.This was a life-changing experience and I
returned back determined to make a difference. </p>
<p>I care deeply about the environment and
volunteer my time in learning about Climate Change and sharing my knowledge to
help make a difference. Through my past experiences in raising awareness about
climate change, I understand that communicating to people about the environment
can be hard, as you need to tell an engaging story to people to want them keep
reading, and I believe that going to Antarctica and seeing climate change and
environmental damage on the front line will help me to become a better
communicator.</p>
<p><b>About The Expedition: </b></p>
<p>Polar explorer, environmental leader and
public speaker <a href=""http://2041.com/about-2041/robert-swan/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b><span>Robert Swan, OBE</span></b></a>,
the first person in history to walk to both the North and South poles founded
2041.</p>
<p>Swan has dedicated his life to the
preservation of Antarctica by the promotion of recycling, renewable energy and
sustainability to combat the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>Each year since 2003 Swan has led expeditions
down to Antarctica, taking with him an international team of young people,
teachers, scientists, environmentalists and corporate leaders as part of his
‘<b><i>Leadership on the Edge</i></b>’ program and this year the expedition will run from <b><i>March
8<sup>th</sup> – March 21<sup>st</sup> 2014</i></b>.</p>
<p>In the year 2041 the Protocol on Environmental
Protection to the <a href=""http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/geopolitical/treaty/update_1991.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b><span>Antarctic Treaty</span></b></a> could
potentially be modified or amended. This treaty currently forbids mining and
drilling in the Antarctic, but come 2041 this could all change and Antarctica
and the waters surrounding the continent may no longer be protected.</p>
<p>Robert Swan and 2041’s aim is to work towards
the continuing protection of the Antarctic Treaty so that the last great
wilderness on earth is never exploited through education and implementation of
renewable energy.</p>
<p><b>Post Antarctica: The Mission I-M-POSSIBLE</b></p>
<p>As part of my application to attend the
expedition, I had to create a project plan that I would implement upon my
return from Antarctica to further spread the word on renewable energy and the
threat facing Antarctica.</p>
<p>As an avid traveler, writer, and communicator
I am passionate to spread awareness about the environment in effective and engaging
ways. The project that I am committing to post expedition is to communicate
about Antarctica and renewable energy projects around the world. You see all
around the world there are young people, such as those attending the 2014 AYAP,
who are creating change in their communities about the way others see climate
change. For example, past participants from India helped setting up a renewable
e-Base in Ladakh, India and a young Swedish girl helped to put solar cookers on
the roofs of the favelas in Brazil. </p>
<p>These stories of young people making a
difference are what I am going to travel and write about, including the great
stories that are here in our local communities in USA and/or India.</p>
<p>I am going to publish these stories to get the
word out about young people making positive change in their local communities,
and also film these stories and make them into a documentary. A mission which
is difficult but surely not impossible.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The environment belongs to everyone, but this
is especially true for Antarctica. Antarctica has no claim on it by any country
or indigenous people. Antarctica belongs to all of us, and therefore it is all
of our jobs to protect it. If we don’t work to protect Antarctica then we are
going to be faced with a monumental crisis.</p>
<p>Antarctica holds 70% of the world’s fresh
water, and if this melts……well let’s not even think about it.</p>
<p>In 2041 the Antarctic Treaty is going to
expire, and if it is not renewed 100% then Antarctica might become open to
mining and drilling by companies looking to exploit the natural reserves.</p>
<p>This might lead to the catastrophe that we are
currently seeing in the Arctic currently.</p>
<p>We need to make sure that renewable energy is
so common, that by the year 2041, no one wants to go to Antarctica and spoil
the pristine wilderness by mining.</p>
<p><b>Why you should sponsor me?</b></p>
<p>Everyone wants to help the environment, but
not everyone can actually go to Antarctica to do so.</p>
<p>Well I want to act as an ambassador for my country/community
to go and get firsthand knowledge. I will bring back the skills that I will acquire so that everyone can benefit.</p>
<p>Through my project, continuous learning  and writing I will be able
to pass on everything I have learnt to even more people outside of my local
community, so that everyone has a chance to learn and feel inspired from my
journey.</p>
<p>I think as young people we are really powerful
to create change because we are passionate and believe that anything is
possible.</p>
<p>So if you too believe that this expedition is
possible, and that this is an incredible opportunity, be sure to help me reach
it!</p>
<p><b>How you can help?</b></p>
<p>Getting to Antarctica is quite expensive as
you can imagine, and I need all of the help that I can get to make my dream
come true.</p>
<p>The total cost of the expedition is $25,000.00
(including expedition fees, flight tickets, and other essentials for the trip)</p>
<p>BUT if you are able to help me raise at least 1/5<sup>th
</sup>of my goal, $5,000.00, then I will be able to secure my place on the trip
100%.</p>
<p>I am hoping to get help from sponsors to fund
the remaining part of the expedition costs.</p>
<p>There are great incentives to donate to my
campaign, so I hope you do and are able to come along on this journey with me!</p>

In 2041 the Antarctic Treaty is going to
expire, and if it is not renewed 100% then Antarctica might become open to
mining and drilling by companies looking to exploit the natural reserves.
This might lead to the catastrophe that we are
currently seeing in the Arctic currently.
We need to make sure that renewable energy is
so common, that by the year 2041, no one wants to go to Antarctica and spoil
the pristine wilderness by mining.
Why you should sponsor me?
Everyone wants to help the environment, but
not everyone can actually go to Antarctica to do so.
Well I want to act as an ambassador for my country/community
to go and get firsthand knowledge. I will bring back the skills that I will acquire so that everyone can benefit.
Through my project, continuous learning  and writing I will be able
to pass on everything I have learnt to even more people outside of my local
community, so that everyone has a chance to learn and feel inspired from my
journey.
I think as young people we are really powerful
to create change because we are passionate and believe that anything is
possible.
So if you too believe that this expedition is
possible, and that this is an incredible opportunity, be sure to help me reach
it!
How you can help?
Getting to Antarctica is quite expensive as
you can imagine, and I need all of the help that I can get to make my dream
come true.
The total cost of the expedition is $25,000.00
(including expedition fees, flight tickets, and other essentials for the trip)
BUT if you are able to help me raise at least 1/5th
of my goal, $5,000.00, then I will be able to secure my place on the trip
100%.
I am hoping to get help from sponsors to fund
the remaining part of the expedition costs.
There are great incentives to donate to my
campaign, so I hope you do and are able to come along on this journey with me!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Friends of the IBA (FIBA) is the only nonprofit acquiring and permanently protecting critical habitat for New York’s endangered and at-risk grassland birds.  </strong>FIBA owns 14 acres of critical habitat and has a conservation agreement on an adjacent 50 acres. Our Alfred Z. Solomon Grassland Bird Viewing Area (AZS) provides the only universally accessible bird viewing area in the region.</p>
<p><strong><u>We’re asking you to help us raise $60,000 so we can purchase and permanently protect another 64 acres of critical habitat</u></strong><strong>! </strong> State biologists say the Washington County Grasslands Important Bird Area (IBA) is critical to the survival of Short-eared owls in New York State. It provides important habitat for 10 of 11 of NY’s most imperiled grassland birds, including state endangered Short-eared owls, Eastern meadowlarks, Upland sandpipers, Northern harriers, American kestrels, Grasshopper sparrows and Bobolinks. It supports over 100 other bird and animal species, including the state bird, the Eastern bluebird.</p>
<p>The NYS Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) has listed the Washington County Grasslands as a conservation priority in the state’s Open Space Plan.  Yet less than 300 acres of this 2,000-acre grassland have been protected.  Hundreds of acres have already been lost to development, which is why FIBA’s work is so vital!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>FIBA needs to raise </strong><strong>$60,000 </strong><strong>to close on this project. </strong>These funds will allow us to purchase 64 acres of critical habitat in the Washington County Grasslands IBA. Total acquisition cost is $125,000; we’ve raised $65,000 and are trying to raise the final $60,000 in 60 days so we can permanently protect this critical land for Short-eared owls and other arctic visitors this winter!</p>
<p><strong>Benefits you will receive when you contribute to this campaign:</strong> 1) knowing you helped ensure Short-eared owls will not disappear from New York State; 2) protecting and preserving this vital resource and NY’s biodiversity; 3) <strong>FIBA Membership – </strong>benefits include free guided bird walks and tours, discounted Winter Raptor Fest admission and more!  You will also receive the benefits listed under each giving level as a special thank-you for your generous contribution.</p>
<p><strong>If we do not make the campaign goal</strong> <strong>we will: </strong>1) escrow funds raised and continue fundraising for this project through 2018; 2) Apply to the landowner for additional time if we do not reach our goal by December 2018; 3) <strong>Failure is NOT an option</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Grassland birds provide FREE ecological services. They control insects and rodents that damage and destroy crops. </strong>Crop yields will decrease if we lose our grassland birds. This will encourage growers to apply MORE toxic chemicals to crops, putting MORE toxic chemicals in our food supply and environment. Finally, food costs will increase as the cost of production increases.</p>
<p><strong>Grassland birds share their habitat with hundreds of other species.</strong> Bees and butterflies pollinate crops such as fruits and vegetables. Deer, turkey, fox, rabbits, and dozens of other animals depend on grasslands for food and cover. Preserving NY’s biodiversity will benefit everyone, not just the kids and adults who will come to see and experience Short-eared owls and other grassland birds in their natural habitat.  </p>
<p><strong>FIBA has a proven track record of successful land conservation projects</strong>. We’ve acquired and permanently protected 14 acres of critical habitat and conserved another 50 acres through a conservation agreement. We’re already seeing increased numbers of at-risk grassland bird species on conserved lands. We’re also assisting DEC with the conservation of 180 acres nearby. This project, combined with our 64-acre purchase, will almost double the acres of conserved land in the Washington County Grasslands!</p>
<p><strong>FIBA has received and successfully implemented grants up to $75,000 </strong>from the New York State Conservation Partnership Program*, Alfred Z. Solomon Charitable Trust, Norcross Wildlife Foundation and private corporations. We’ve been recognized by the <u>New York State Ornithological Association</u> for our work to conserve grassland birds and have strong support from NYSDEC, Land Trust Alliance, landowners, residents, government agencies, other nonprofits and elected officials. </p>

<h3>What's at stake...</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm Tim Tynan, producer, PhD student, and educator in Madison, Wisconsin. Like you, I'm concerned about the environment, tribal sovereignty, and the influence of big business in government. Today I'm especially wary of the mining dangers posed to one of the most precious and pristine ecosystems in the Great Lakes: the sloughs (pronounced ""slews"") at Bad River. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt;"">The
Bad River and Kakagon sloughs compose the largest undeveloped wetland system on the
Great Lakes. Because of its size, uniqueness and varied plant life, the Kakagon
Sloughs is a designated National Natural Landmark. The 16,000 acre Bad
River-Kagagon complex is diversely populated with over 28 plant communities and
is home to over 70 rare plant and animal species. </span><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt;"">Groups
like The Nature Conservancy and the Bad River Watershed Alliance have been
working tirelessly to maintain the quality of the watershed in partnership with
the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. <span style=""""> </span></span><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt; color: #262626;"">The Wisconsin Wetlands Association
named the Kakagon-Bad River Sloughs one of Wisconsinï¿½s 100 Wetland Gems, noting
the ï¿½extensive size and high quality of these Great Lakes coastal wetlands.ï¿½</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>But to the native people at Bad River, the sloughs are much more. Because of the abundant wild rice (manoomin) the sloughs are a cultural and spiritual treasure like no other. In fact, the meandering channels and bayou-like wetlands have been so coveted over the years, the Ojibwe have maintained a protective--almost secretive--relationship with the sloughs. But now, faced with perhaps the greatest threat the sloughs have ever faced, few people outside Bad River truly recognize what is at stake. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Short Films and Stunning Images</h3>
<p>The video above is just a tiny sample (""teaser"") of what we hope to accomplish with this campaign. The goal of this campaign is to produce the first in a series of visually impressive, short (10 to 15 min) films about the sloughs, wild rice, Bad River, and the people likely to be most impacted if a mine were to open in the vicinity. The goal is simply to impress upon others what is at stake here. The short films will join a larger traveling exhibit about the same topics and will also include live narrators, artifacts, and other stunning images. We hope the exhibit can start making the rounds later next spring. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Contribution, Your Perk</h3>
<p>Thankfully, nearly all the production time and work will be donated for this project. The $2400 is for licensing the footage, pictures, music, and compensating elder interviewees who participate in this first short film, ""The Bayous of the North"". </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Every contributor will receive a post-card thank you note featuring one of the images in the film. Contributors who give $25 will also receive a pound of hand-harvested wild rice from the sloughs. Those who give $50 will receive the wild rice and a limited-edition print of one of the stunning images in the film.

</div></div>","What's at stake...
Hello, I'm Tim Tynan, producer, PhD student, and educator in Madison, Wisconsin. Like you, I'm concerned about the environment, tribal sovereignty, and the influence of big business in government. Today I'm especially wary of the mining dangers posed to one of the most precious and pristine ecosystems in the Great Lakes: the sloughs (pronounced ""slews"") at Bad River. 



The
Bad River and Kakagon sloughs compose the largest undeveloped wetland system on the
Great Lakes. Because of its size, uniqueness and varied plant life, the Kakagon
Sloughs is a designated National Natural Landmark. The 16,000 acre Bad
River-Kagagon complex is diversely populated with over 28 plant communities and
is home to over 70 rare plant and animal species. Groups
like The Nature Conservancy and the Bad River Watershed Alliance have been
working tirelessly to maintain the quality of the watershed in partnership with
the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.  The Wisconsin Wetlands Association
named the Kakagon-Bad River Sloughs one of Wisconsinï¿½s 100 Wetland Gems, noting
the ï¿½extensive size and high quality of these Great Lakes coastal wetlands.ï¿½


But to the native people at Bad River, the sloughs are much more. Because of the abundant wild rice (manoomin) the sloughs are a cultural and spiritual treasure like no other. In fact, the meandering channels and bayou-like wetlands have been so coveted over the years, the Ojibwe have maintained a protective--almost secretive--relationship with the sloughs. But now, faced with perhaps the greatest threat the sloughs have ever faced, few people outside Bad River truly recognize what is at stake. 


The Short Films and Stunning Images
The video above is just a tiny sample (""teaser"") of what we hope to accomplish with this campaign. The goal of this campaign is to produce the first in a series of visually impressive, short (10 to 15 min) films about the sloughs, wild rice, Bad River, and the people likely to be most impacted if a mine were to open in the vicinity. The goal is simply to impress upon others what is at stake here. The short films will join a larger traveling exhibit about the same topics and will also include live narrators, artifacts, and other stunning images. We hope the exhibit can start making the rounds later next spring. 


Your Contribution, Your Perk
Thankfully, nearly all the production time and work will be donated for this project. The $2400 is for licensing the footage, pictures, music, and compensating elder interviewees who participate in this first short film, ""The Bayous of the North"". 

Every contributor will receive a post-card thank you note featuring one of the images in the film. Contributors who give $25 will also receive a pound of hand-harvested wild rice from the sloughs. Those who give $50 will receive the wild rice and a limited-edition print of one of the stunning images in the film. If you give $100, you will receive the wild-rice and your print will be signed and framed! Want to be listed in the credits as an Associate Producer, then give $500-- you also get the wild rice and framed image! Executive Producers include anyone who gives $1000 and up.  In addition to the credit acknowledgement, wild rice and framed image, Executive Producers also receive a special recognition certificate to be included in the traveling exhibit.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Despite restoration efforts, over half of the world's mangroves have 
been destroyed by developers and others in recent times. Recife has 
beautiful mangroves. They protect coastal areas from erosion and offer a
 quiet marine region for young organisms, oysters, sponges, shrimps, mud
 lobsters and critical species of fish and birds. Come mid July I will be working 
for a nonprofit called Centro Escola Mangue in Recife in North East 
Brazil to raise awareness of their importance. Please support me in my 
efforts to conserve this important habitat.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Supporting Centro Escola Mangue will ensure that the mangroves in North East Brazil are preserved for years to come.<br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money raised will be 100% used by Centro Escola Mangue to raise awareness of mangroves and change behaviors among the people that have the most direct impact on their survival, in this case middle class people in Recife. </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><b>The Peterborough Greenspace
Coalition</b> is an
alliance of four local citizens’ groups and numerous individuals, working to
protect and preserve greenspaces in the City of Peterborough, Ontario. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Our current
campaign — PARKS NOT PARKWAYS — comes out of a common belief that Peterborough
neither needs nor wants a new 4-lane, walled street through Jackson Park and
the beautiful Parkway Greenspace and Trail.</p>
<p>We believe
the Parkway is not a wise investment of over $66 Million of our tax dollars. We
can think of many improvements the city needs more than an expensive new road. You
may even want to keep your money in your pocket and not put the City further in
debt. </p>
<p>Citizens have
repeatedly said “NO” to the Parkway. The 1991 City Mayoral election was won on
a “NO Parkway!” campaign. When given a chance to vote on the Parkway in a 2003
referendum, we said ""NO"" by a wide margin. Council then instructed
City staff to remove the Parkway proposal from the City Plan, which was never
done! </p>
<p>The current
council has suddenly brought the issue back to life — spending over $1 Million on
a so-called Environmental Assessment proposal which will cut a swath through historic
Jackson Park. This would contravene an agreement with the Nicholls Trust, which
donated the park, and the City's own by-law. As well, it would replace one
of the City's most beautiful cycling and walking trails with a four-lane
arterial road, and 2.5 km of sound walls (not to mention multiple new
intersections slowing down traffic).</p>
<p>Our first
Indiegogo campaign allowed us to print and distribute over 3,500 
pamphlets, 300 lawn signs, 500 buttons and produce a beautiful and informative
booth at the local <i>GreenUp Expo</i>.  We
are about to launch the next phase of our campaign, to save Jackson Park and
the Parkway Greenspace and Trail from being destroyed forever.  This is an
expensive proposition and we need your continued support. </p>
<p>Every dollar raised
in this campaign will be used for direct costs related to public awareness and community
mobilization, under the management of the Coalition’s volunteer leadership.

have City coffers to dip into to fund our message.  Please join us with whatever

witnessed my first birth. It went on late into the night. The sources of light
used by the midwife were kerosene lamps. Several of these lamps were spread
throughout the room. Smoke emitted by these lamps contains high amounts of
black carbon polluting our environment and causing severe health risks. The
first thing this newborn breathed in, was the smoke produced from these harmful
kerosene lamps. I imagine the future of that newborn. Like any other child in

</h3>
<p><strong>THE STORY:</strong></p>
<p>Aly Laughlin is currently planning a summer charity drag show which will take place in Provincetown, Cape Cod at the Provincetown Town Hall, during Whale Week 2013. The net proceeds from the event will go to the whale conservation efforts World Wildlife Fund and the Provincetown Center for Coastal Studies. </p>

</div>
<p>Aly has always been passionate about animals and conservation. At the age of 8, she had her first personal encounter swimming with a dolphin named Bailey at an interactive educational program in Bermuda. She loved it so much, she came back the next day and the teacher let her help teach the class. Recently, she decided that she needed to do something to address the strange (mostly negative) relationship humans have had with cetaceans [dolphins, whales, and porpoises] throughout history. She realized that the best place to start would be where she could embrace her love of these magnificent creatures -- and her love of drag artists -- in Provincetown, MA. This event will combine these loves, celebrating the relationship of humans and nature through art, beauty, and simplicity.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">In conjunction with the Whale Extravaganza Drag Show, Aly has also launched her own non-profit organization, Whale Extravaganza Fund, Inc., which aims to celebrate and raise awareness for whales and other animals through all kinds of artistic endeavors; this is just the beginning.</div>

THE STORY:
Aly Laughlin is currently planning a summer charity drag show which will take place in Provincetown, Cape Cod at the Provincetown Town Hall, during Whale Week 2013. The net proceeds from the event will go to the whale conservation efforts World Wildlife Fund and the Provincetown Center for Coastal Studies. 

The Venue: The Provincetown Town Hall

Aly has always been passionate about animals and conservation. At the age of 8, she had her first personal encounter swimming with a dolphin named Bailey at an interactive educational program in Bermuda. She loved it so much, she came back the next day and the teacher let her help teach the class. Recently, she decided that she needed to do something to address the strange (mostly negative) relationship humans have had with cetaceans [dolphins, whales, and porpoises] throughout history. She realized that the best place to start would be where she could embrace her love of these magnificent creatures -- and her love of drag artists -- in Provincetown, MA. This event will combine these loves, celebrating the relationship of humans and nature through art, beauty, and simplicity.
In conjunction with the Whale Extravaganza Drag Show, Aly has also launched her own non-profit organization, Whale Extravaganza Fund, Inc., which aims to celebrate and raise awareness for whales and other animals through all kinds of artistic endeavors; this is just the beginning.

<h2>
<strong>Update:  Our Indiegogo Campaign is Over, </strong><strong>But We Are Still Taking Pre-orders For HayTag!</strong>
</h2>
<p><strong><br/></strong>The interest in HayTag from distributors, resellers, and other partners has been overwhelming so we are pressing forward as planned with HayTag!  <a href=""http://haystacktechnologies.com/haytag/haytag-store/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can place a pre-order here</a> and we will deliver your HayTag by March 30, 2013!</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><strong>What is HayTag?</strong></h1>
<p>Think of HayTag as “dogtag 2.0” -- a better way to keep pets safe and secure using smartphones and a new long-range and lightweight wireless technology.  With HayTag, pet owners quickly locate a lost pet and get alerts when a pet leaves (or enters) a designated area. Owners can immediately organize a lost pet search among other HayTag users with their smartphone. And none of this requires invasive microchips or costly GPS collars.</p>
<h1><strong>1 in 3 Pets Go Missing, Yet Most Are Never Found</strong></h1>
<p>Every year, nearly 10 million pets go missing and according to the <a href=""http://www.aspca.org/about-us/faq/pet-statistics.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SPCA</a>, the average recovery rate for lost dogs is less than 20%, and recovery rates for lost cats are less than 5%. Today, recovering a lost pet relies on outdated techniques like posting ""lost"" flyers in your neighborhood, calling local shelters and vets, and searching frantically by foot or car -- usually in vain. Some pets are ""microchipped"", but four competing microchip ""standards"" and only a 12"" read range means the odds of your lost pet being recovered via microchipping are so slim many veterinarians do not even recommend spending the money. GPS-based collars are bulky, have a short battery life, and can cost more than $400 each, not including monthly subscription fees. There is a better way.</p>
<h1><strong>HayTag:  Easy To Set Up, Easy To Use</strong></h1>
<div> </div>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/251/610/0740ef848381f8beabf0efeb58421c30_large.png?1352409531"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>HayTag consists of a tiny, lightweight tag that you attach to your pet’s collar and activate with your smartphone using a small HayTag adapter. Upon losing a pet, HayTag users can quickly scan the neighborhood to locate their pet using the free HayTag application available on the iPhone AppStore. Don’t have an iPhone? HayTag also supports iPad and iPod Touch. HayTag does not require a fixed “base station” and there are no monthly or annual subscription fees.</p>
<h1><strong>Solar Powered = No Recharging or Replacing Batteries</strong></h1>

<p>With HayTag, you’ll never have to worry about recharging a battery or replacing a dead one. HayTag’s wireless technology, called <a href=""http://haystacktechnologies.com/products-and-services/what-is-dash7/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DASH7</a>, achieves long range with amazingly low power draw, making the use of solar power on long range wireless devices a reality.</p>

<p>HayTag helps you find your pet using a unique direction finding feature and your smartphone’s map.  No more ""lost dog"" signs or random desperate searching.  HayTag's range is as much as 1 kilometer in the U.S., and even longer in many markets outside the U.S.  HayTag even finds pets located indoors and other places where GPS can't reach.</p>

<h1><strong>What People Are Saying</strong></h1>
<p><em>“We see far too many people devastated when they lose loved pets and they have only traditional – and largely ineffective ways – to find them,” said Scott Delucchi, Sr. Vice President, Community Relations, with the <a href=""http://www.peninsulahumanesociety.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peninsula Humane Society</a> &amp; SPCA in Burlingame, California. “Simply stated, Haytag can save lives and heartache and be a lost pet’s ticket home.”</em></p>

<h1><strong>What is DASH7?</strong></h1>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/243/095/941ed18fb6b7bec267fa4de3e13388cc_large.jpg?1351997720"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><a href=""http://haystacktechnologies.com/products-and-services/what-is-dash7/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DASH7</a>, the wireless technology behind HayTag, is a new ""instant-on"", long range, low power wireless communications standard for applications like short text messages or temperature sensor readings.  DASH7 is open source, inexpensive, and operates on a single global license-free frequency band, 433 MHz.  We believe it's the most important low power wireless standard in the world today.</p>
<h1><strong>DASH7 Was Designed for the Internet of Things!</strong></h1>
<p>DASH7 is unlike any other wireless technology standard on the planet today. </p>
<p><strong>• Long range.</strong>   DASH7’s range is many times greater than its next competitors, but also works so well indoors it makes meshing obsolete. DASH7’s range in the USA is between 200 meters and 1 kilometer, but in Europe, Australia, China, and many other markets, multi-kilometer ranges are easily achievable.</p>
<p><strong>• Low power.</strong>   DASH7 uses less than 1 milliwatt of power on average. No other low power wireless standard can offer full two-way, long range communications using a solar cell like DASH7.</p>
<p><strong>• Instant-on.</strong> DASH7 was designed to “lock on” to fast moving things or people in ways that other wireless technologies cannot match. DASH7’s low latency is enabled through a unique query architecture that minimizes the elaborate hand-shaking typical in wireline-based protocols like IEEE 802.15.4, Bluetooth, or WiFi.</p>
<p><strong>• Inexpensive.</strong> DASH7 tags can be built very inexpensively using off-the-shelf components. DASH7‘s firmware stack compiles into less than 20KB, enabling the use of lower cost silicon and minimal memory. DASH7 uses a license-free, globally available frequency, 433 MHz, which reduces the need for multiple SKU’s and simplifies interoperability across vendors.</p>
<p><strong><em>• Open source.</em></strong> There is nothing proprietary about DASH7, which is a complete open standard with open source firmware. No other wireless IoT technology in the world offers this same level of openness. There is even an industry consortium, the DASH7 Alliance, to ensure interoperability across DASH7 vendors. DASH7 was also built with interoperability at the forefront of our minds.</p>
<h1><strong>The HayTag App</strong></h1>
<p>The free HayTag app for iPhone will be available via the iPhone App Store and, later in 2013, via Google Play (Android).</p>
<p>The setup process is simple. You attach HayTag to your pet, along with the iPhone adapter we provide you. You download and turn on the HayTag application from the AppStore, and the application immediately recognizes the tag on your pet and prompts you to personalize the information on the tag. Then, you’re done. If you have more than one pet, it’s easy to repeat the process.</p>
<p>Our team has been developing and delivering mobile, desktop, and cloud-based software applications for nearly 20 years and we have yet to find a customer who said an app was “too easy to use”. Our goal is to make using HayTag as drop-dead simple as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Also, the HayTag app supports the iPad and the iPod Touch!</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Security</strong></h1>
<p>When we designed DASH7, we knew that security and privacy had been a weakness for many RFID and internet of things technologies of the past, not to mention for the next wave of location-based services. With HayTag, users just check a box during the tag setup process to enable AES 128-bit encryption, making it next to impossible for a stalker or other miscreant to monitor you or your pets while using HayTag. </p>
<p>We also designed DASH7 with “listen before talk” capability, meaning your pet’s HayTag is NOT in some non-stop “beacon” mode, blasting its unique ID every 20 milliseconds, as some other technologies like Bluetooth might do. In effect, your pet’s HayTag stays “cloaked” until an authorized user (you and your smartphone) tell it to speak.</p>
<h1><strong>What Do I Get?</strong></h1>
<p>Each HayTag comes with an iPhone adapter or you can purchase multiple Haytags and multiple adapters if you have multiple pets or multiple owners. Each HayTag is ready to use right out of the box and if you ever need to purchase additional HayTags, they’ll all be interoperable with the same adapter and iPhone app we provide up front. We will offer free online support via the iPhone app as well as on our company’s website, but we are working to make HayTag so easy to install and use, we hope you’ll never need it.</p>
<h1><strong>Manufacturing</strong></h1>
<p>The HayTag is designed and prototyped in San Francisco and we have a trusted manufacturing partner in Southeast Asia with extensive experience building “battlefield tested” RFID devices. We will use standard, off-the-shelf parts in the HayTag with a pedigree of withstanding the occasional trampling by a tank or Humvee. Our team includes former team members from Savi Technology (now Lockheed Martin) and we know how to build the HayTag better, faster, and more cheaply than anyone else in the business. Our team also has deep experience in building mobile, desktop, and cloud-based software applications for consumer and enterprise markets, so building the HayTag app is among the simpler software projects we have ever executed.</p>
<h1><strong>How Our Indiegogo Funds Will Be Used</strong></h1>
<p>If we successfully fund this HayTag project, funds will be used for bringing the HayTag hardware to commercial readiness and to complete development of our iPhone app and back-end services. For the hardware, we want to continue to optimize the HayTag’s antenna to maximize its range, complete FCC and ERC certifications, and finalize the design of our tag and adapter motherboards. For the software, we have to complete development and testing of the iOS app and complete and test the back-end services required for some feature.</p>
<h1><strong>Developers</strong></h1>
<p>Our company is in the business of supporting developers who want to bring DASH7 to new applications and markets we haven’t even thought of yet. Developers are encouraged to back the HayTag project, including via the Developer Kit Pack, but also encouraged to visit our company website at <a href=""http://www.haystacktechnologies.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.haystacktechnologies.com</a>, where we have a range of options to support developers of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<h1>What<strong> Else Could You Do With HayTag?</strong>
</h1>
<p>We love animals and are thrilled with the response so far to HayTag from the veterinary, pet rescue, and pet owner community. But we know we’re only scratching the surface with this Indiegogo project. In addition to the ideas already being pursued by DASH7 developers in automotive and building automation, we see opportunities to solve everyday problems like tracking snowboards at a ski resort or golf clubs at the 19th hole. Or improving the way farmers manage herds of cattle or sheep. Or managing tools at a construction site. And hundreds of other applications.  So backing HayTag is not only the beginning of the end of the era of lost pets, it’s supporting a critically important wireless technology with world-changing applications that just aren’t being solved today with the wireless technologies that are out there.s</p>

The HayTag stays “invisible” until an authorized user (you, the owner) goes looking for it. There is no beaconing (unlike, say, Bluetooth) and we’ve really worked to build privacy and security deep into the product without sacrificing performance.
3.  Can my company use HayTag for tracking cows?
Yes!  We have received several inquiries on this.  The HayTag can be attached to the cow's ear like other cow tags using a ""button"" similar to existing cow tags.  HayTag also has an ambient temperature sensor to detect temperature in and around a cow's ear.
4.  When will the Android version be ready?
Summer 2013.
5.  I am having trouble using PayPal/some other funding mechanism on the HayTag Indiegogo page.  What should I do?
Send us a message at pat@haystacktechnologies.com and we'll help you figure it out!
6.  I want to become a HayTag distributor in my country/market.  What should I do?
Send us a note at info@haystacktechnologies.com and we will respond in the next two weeks.  
7.  Can I personalize HayTag?
Yes!  All backers will receive a questionnaire asking for a) how they would like their HayTag(s) personalized (animal name, your phone number, license #, etc.) as well as to select their choice of colors.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>- The collaboration with the Artists House will let us grow conceptually, and give us a much needed arena for arranging events and networking.</p>

They supply bird song through being eaten. Plants filter our air of dust and pollutions. Local honey alleviates allergies.

Oslo Apiary came about when two friends wanted to work more outdoors. We hoped to create value-infused part time jobs for ourselves and envisaged Oslo Apiary as a mash up between inner city environmental protection, urban agriculture and cultural entrepreneurship.Our apiary produces short travelled, locally produced, pesticide free, organic honey and beeswax that we sell to local breweries and cocktail bars to cover our expenses. We invite friends who work in creative fields, musicians, film makers, artists, antiquarians and even the odd male choir, to partake in our plight and pay them in produce.The small patch of land we've been using so far - a round about of sorts - is to become a building site. But we've been lucky enough to be offered a spot on the roof of the Artists House (Kunstnernes Hus), downtown, near the royal castle and its surrounding park. Please help us invest in two new hives for this site, by funding our project.Here is the plan:By helping us reach our goal of 1600$ (9900NKr / 1180Euro), we will be able to expand our beekeeping on the roof of the Artist House and permanently finance Oslo Apiary through cooperation with the house own basement brewery.This would let us reach all of our goals in one go:
- The two new hives will help keep the downtown area of Oslo, green. 
- The honey they produce will be Oslo´s shortest travelled food product, with a travel distance of 30 feet, vertically. 
- The collaboration with the Artists House will let us grow conceptually, and give us a much needed arena for arranging events and networking.
With our goal reached, we will also be able to have our film crew film us for another season, as we make the transition, and keep you updated on our progress. A third of the sum goes to them.Bees help keep our city green. They supply bird song through being eaten. Plants filter our air of dust and pollutions. Local honey alleviates allergies. Through pollination our apiary keeps wild bees, bumble bees, plants an insects from going extinct. Join us in our work. Urban beekeeping might be costly and hard to make money off, but letting the small critters go extinct could be costlier. During our first year we spent 550$ on the brand design and marketing of Oslo Apiary, 1050$ on making this video for Indigogo and other promotional uses, and 1600$ on the bees, their hives, paint, suits, transport and equipment, such as a smoker, cube irons, honey jars and plastic barrels.

Questa è la seconda campagna di crowdfunding che effettuiamo su Indiegogo. La prima, consultabile al link www.indiegogo.com/projects/ortho-cultura , aveva come obiettivo 1700 $ e, nonostante il supporto di decine di persone, si è chiusa a 275 $. Il vostro contributo ci ha permesso di acquistare una parte dei materiali e iniziare la fase di montaggio dell'installazione. Questa seconda campagna ORTHO CULTURA -construction-  ha lo scopo di ottenere i restanti 1425 $ in modo da permetterci di acquistare i materiali rimasti e completare il nostro progetto.
This is the second crowdfunding campaign we carry on Indiegogo. The first, available at the link www.indiegogo.com/projects/ortho-cultura , had as its goal $ 1,700 and, despite the support of dozens of people, ended at $ 275. Your contribution has allowed us to buy some of the materials and to begin the assembly phase of the installation. This second campaign ORTHO CULTURA -construction- aims to get the remaining $ 1,425 in order to buy the remained materials and complete our project.


Se hai già contribuito al progetto ORTHO CULTURA e sei curioso di sapere come procede il nostro lavoro, guarda il video qui sotto. Se invece è la prima volta che senti parlare di orto urbano e agricoltura sociale, continua a leggere e scopri perchè abbiamo bisogno del tuo contributo! 
If you have already contributed to the project ORTHO CULTURA and you're curious to know how our work goes, watch the video below. If it is the first time you have heard of urban farm and social agriculture, read on and see why we need your support!



Siamo
Edoardo e Carlo, due ingegneri laureati in ingegneria edile-architettura, innamorati dell'architettura e di tutto quello che attorno vi gravita.
Hi everyone, we are Edoardo and Carlo, two Civil engineer and architect  with a strong passion for architecture in a broad sense and for everything that gravitates around it.



Siamo risultati vincitori di un bando di concorso per la
realizzazione di un'installazione di architettura da esporre in occasione della fiera  dell'agricoltura “Festival degli Orti” 2015,
che si terrà a Monza dal 14 al 24 maggio, e vorremmo poter realizzare davvero il nostro progetto.We won a competition for the construction of an architecture installation to be exhibited at the agriculture fair ""Festival degli Orti 2015"" that will be held in Monza from May 14th to May 24th, and we would love to truly realize our project.TERRALAB
3.0 - www.terralabtrepuntozero.orgFESTIVAL
DEGLI ORTI - www.festivaldegliorti.itIl
bando che ci ha visto vincitori non prevede lo stanziamento di fondi per la
realizzazione e obbliga i progettisti a farsi carico degli oneri di esecuzione. Essendo due giovani professionisti e non avendo alle spalle aziende o privati
che ci sostengano, siamo alla ricerca di fondi, partnership e sponsor che ci aiutino
nella realizzazione dell’installazione.The competition we won unfortunately does not include funds allocation for the project realization. For this reason we are forced to fund the execution with our own forces. As young professionals with no support from companies, we are looking for funds, partnerships or sponsors willing to help us in the realization of the installation.è un progetto ""sociale"" nato con l'ambiziosa volontà di suggerire e
sensibilizzare di fronte la necessità di rileggere l’agricoltura. Pensarla ed
immaginarla in modi nuovi rispetto al passato, perdendo pregiudizi e
preconcetti storici e storicizzati, tendendo ad un’idea di agricoltura nuova, accompagnata
per questo da nuove forme e stimoli. Saper vedere l’agricoltura con occhi nuovi
rivalutandone il carattere strategico a livello economico e sociale.is a social project born with the ambitious desire to suggest and raise awareness of the need to re-read the concept of agriculture. Think and imagine it in an innovative way by losing historical prejudices and preconceptions, tending to a brand new idea of agriculture, accompanied by new forms and stimuli. Being able to see agriculture with new eyes revalues its strategic role from an economic and social point of view.ORTHO CULTURA interpreta la
necessità di guardare all’agricoltura non solo come un mezzo per “vivere in
economia” ma anche come opportunità di “fare economia”, ricominciare a credere
che con un’agricoltura nuova, smart, intelligente e all’avanguardia per metodi
e gestione, si possano creare allo stesso tempo business e integrazione.ORTHO CULTURA interprets the need to look at agriculture not only as a means to ""live with no great expenses"" but also as an opportunity to ""economize"", by starting to believe that agriculture can be a way to create both business and integration through new, smart and innovative methods and a renowned management style.
Un’agricoltura 3.0 per approccio ed
atteggiamento, per questo giovane e alla portata di chiunque.Our purpose is to boost agriculture 3.0 characterized by a new approach and attitude, attractive for young people and affordable for everyone.Il progetto è stato pensato come un'installazione di facile e veloce realizzazione in linea con lo spirito e le linee guida del concorso. Materiali sostenibili, ma soprattutto semilavorati, utilizzati secondo principi di UP-CYCLING e RE-CYCLING, di facile reperimento e comoda installazione. Il budget minimo di cui avremo bisogno per poter realizzare ed esporre la nostra opera è stato calcolato considerando il costo e/o il valore di questi materiali.The project was conceived as an installation of quick and easy implementation in line with the spirit and guidelines of the contest. Sustainable materials, but mostly semi-used ones in accordance with the principles of UP-CYCLING and RE-CYCLING, easy to find and to install. The minimum budget that we need to realize and expose our work has been calculated considering the cost and / or the value of these materials.
Una rilettura in chiave moderna dell'orto urbano, e della possibilità di fare dell'agricoltura un momento sociale, aggregante, nuovo luogo di relazione, incontro, scambio ed apprendimento.
A modern reinterpretation of the urban farm, and of the possibility of making agriculture a social activity, being at the same time aggregating and a place of relationship, meeting, exchange and mutual learning.






Un elemento flessibile
caratterizzato da una progettazione aperta che sottende la possibilità di
utilizzo a varia scala e su scenari profondamente diversi. Suggerisce un
approccio di condivisione e collaborazione proponendo una lettura mai univoca
dello spazio. 

A flexible element characterized by an open design that underlies the possibility of using different scales and deeply different scenarios. It suggests sharing and collaboration by offering a multilateral space reading that is never unique.

Tavolati in legno montati
ad incastro realizzano una griglia ortogonale statica che regola l’inserimento
degli elementi necessari alla coltivazione, vera parte dinamica. Pozzetti in
calcestruzzo trovano nuovo utilizzo tra le maglie del basamento dando vita a passerelle
distributive.
Wooden planks interlocking constitute an orthogonal static grid that rules the inclusion of the necessary elements for cultivation, that represent the truly dynamic part. Concrete manholes find new use in the base meshes creating walkways distribution.
L’installazione perimetrata da elementi verticali, leggeri e permeabili, idealizza pareti e narra uno spazio architettonico in cui elementi
classici del costruire vengono prestati all’orto che diviene, in tal modo,
urbano.

The installation bounded
by light and permeable vertical elements, idealizes walls and narrates an
architectural space where classic elements of the building are “lent” to the
garden that becomes, in this way, urban.

La volontà di veicolare il progetto partendo dalle nostre realtà, con la possibilità di estenderlo verso il bacino di utenza di molte associazioni no-profit che già operano con successo permettendo a famiglie intere di fare economia attraverso piccoli ma preziosissimi sforzi.
Our goal is to convey the project starting from our reality, with the possibility of extending it to the user base of many non-profit organizations that already operate successfully in this sector, allowing entire families to make savings through small but valuable efforts.
Una vocazione totalmente sociale che speriamo possa prendere il largo grazie a tutti voi!

Thus, Ortho Cultura
is 100% inspired by a social vocation and we truly hope that it will take off

<p><b>My vision/story:</b>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest on my
project. For those who know me will probably have a better idea where
I come from or my work background experience. I have been working for
two years at a small scale organic farm in the Northwest of
Connecticut. I was raised in the mountains of the tropical rainforest
of Puerto Rico. My dad and mom where full time farmers and gardeners
which was not a common career at the time in our country. After a
hurricane in 1998 the recovery process of the land, infrastructure
and personal assets was indeterminately long. Then my dad became a
certified arborist and I became his helper with my brothers and
sister. 
</p>
<p>All the experience that I have gather
at Fort Hill Farm on sustainable organic growing technique have give me
the confidence to start growing vegetable in the place I grew up
doing the same. In Puerto Rico the conscious about organic local food
have become more popular then it was before. Mostly around the touristic areas like restaurants and cafes have increase its organic,
natural and local food consumption by a lot. We are on a island which
depends on more than 85% of food that is imported. It is a lot to
food need it to feed almost 4 millions of people in this island. In
my point of view and having already some land available to work on I
am in the need to start growing vegetables in a more efficient,
productive and sustainable way. Right now I am trying to visualize my
farm project for the next three to five years from now. The first
step of that process it has already began. (I am already back in
Puerto Rico for the winter time. I start to work on the area, putting
tools together, making a list of stuffs I need and getting ready to
buy the tractor and some implements.) The walk-behind tractor is an
indispensable tool to work in this first step and it will be my most
important tool on the farm job from now on. We have a small green
house which needs some repairs but is fine for now. It is a perfect
place to start seeds and do other projects. But this I will not need
it until next year, once I get back and stay for longer. 
</p>
<p>Once I have the walk-behind tractor I
could plough the soil and spade it. Then plant a tropical cover crop,
important for the nitrogen fixation process. So then once I come back
next year the soil will be ready to start planting the vegetables.

<p>
</p><p>This past year I was able to “save”
 some money from the work at the farm. But it still not enough to
support myself for the period I will be working at the farm without
getting paid. For now I am focus on getting the walk-behind tractor,
the implements, few materials and the seeds for the cover crops. The
money I am expecting to collect it will not cover for all this, only
for the tractor and the implements it's</p>
<p>more of what I am raising with this crowd funding. Shipping the machine with the implements to Puerto Rico
it will be a little bit expensive and also taxes.

<p>

correct answer. It could be mainly restaurants, and farmers markets,
but I will also will look for a CSA program. But CSA is not to known
in this area, but that will take a time until I settle back in Puerto

and the business. But for now I will start growing food thinking in
self consumption and at least sell to few restaurants and go to one
farmers markets. <br/></p><p>Watch the video for more details and to see more pictures. And stay in tune for pictures and videos updates before the campaigne ends. <br/></p><p><b>Thanks</b></p><p>

depends on more than 85% of food that is imported. It is a lot to
food need it to feed almost 4 millions of people in this island. In
my point of view and having already some land available to work on I
am in the need to start growing vegetables in a more efficient,
productive and sustainable way. Right now I am trying to visualize my
farm project for the next three to five years from now. The first
step of that process it has already began. (I am already back in
Puerto Rico for the winter time. I start to work on the area, putting
tools together, making a list of stuffs I need and getting ready to
buy the tractor and some implements.) The walk-behind tractor is an
indispensable tool to work in this first step and it will be my most
important tool on the farm job from now on. We have a small green
house which needs some repairs but is fine for now. It is a perfect
place to start seeds and do other projects. But this I will not need
it until next year, once I get back and stay for longer. 

Once I have the walk-behind tractor I
could plough the soil and spade it. Then plant a tropical cover crop,
important for the nitrogen fixation process. So then once I come back
next year the soil will be ready to start planting the vegetables. 

-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-
Where your funding will go to ? 


This past year I was able to “save”
 some money from the work at the farm. But it still not enough to
support myself for the period I will be working at the farm without
getting paid. For now I am focus on getting the walk-behind tractor,
the implements, few materials and the seeds for the cover crops. The
money I am expecting to collect it will not cover for all this, only
for the tractor and the implements it's
more of what I am raising with this crowd funding. Shipping the machine with the implements to Puerto Rico
it will be a little bit expensive and also taxes. 


-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-
What will be my sales avenue ? 


Sincerely right now I do not have the
correct answer. It could be mainly restaurants, and farmers markets,
but I will also will look for a CSA program. But CSA is not to known
in this area, but that will take a time until I settle back in Puerto
Rico so I can have a better idea of what it could be the best for me
and the business. But for now I will start growing food thinking in
self consumption and at least sell to few restaurants and go to one
farmers markets. Watch the video for more details and to see more pictures. And stay in tune for pictures and videos updates before the campaigne ends. Thanks

<h2><strong>Help Us Close the Loop!</strong></h2>
<p>Long Lane Farm, a student- and community-run organic farm in Middletown CT, needs your help to build a chicken coop that will house 20 happy, healthy, free-range chickens who will produce eggs, till the soil, and create manure for the farm.</p>
<p>We want to welcome them as fellow workers and fellow participants in the farm ecosystem, but first we need the coop!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>But This Isn't Any Old Coop...</strong></h2>
<p><strong>It's been designed specifically for our site and our project by the Architecture II Class at Wesleyan University.</strong> Elijah Huge, Architecture Professor, and his advanced Architecture students have collaborated with the Long Lane Farmers over the last several months to design a beautiful, ingenious coop for the farm.</p>
<p>This is an amazing opportunity for our farm. We need your help to make it a reality!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>About Our Farm</h2>
<p>Located on 2 acres of land in Middletown, CT, Long Lane Farm grows a wide variety of organic vegetables for Wesleyan University and the greater Middletown community. We provide a place for people from all sectors of the community to work, eat, tal, and enjoy the beautiful farm environment together at Community Work-Days every Saturday, regular pot-lucks at the farm, and our educational programs for local elementary school students during the summer.</p>
<p>The addition of this coop will broaden the variety of produce we can offer the community, and it will also enhance farm education and experience that we can offer the many communities that converge at Long Lane.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p><strong>Your donations fund the purchase of materials for the building of the ""Spinal Coop,""</strong> as it has been affectionately termed by the Archetecture students and the farmers. The picture above is a scale model of the coop, which will house about twenty chickens. The coop has been designed to use as little energy as possible and will be made out of corrugated plastic, wood, and metal. Each chicken will have adequate roosting and outdoor space. The chickens' water will be collected from their own roof, which will drain into a feeder in the coop. They will receive food and will have their eggs taken through a single, specially designed door that the farmers can open and close without entering the coop and disturbing the birds.</p>
<p>The coop will serve both as an important learning experience for the Architecture II students and as a valuable asset on the farm in the years to come. After the coop is constructed, we will buy young chickens from nearby Clark Farm.</p>
<p>We are seeking to provide a more ethical source of eggs to the Wesleyan and Middletown communities. Eggs will be distributed weekly through a local co-op based at the farm. </p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>All humans need food. In an increasingly complex world where the politics of consumption rule over people all over the world, it is hard to hold on to any connection to what we put in our bodies. We at Long Lane believe that small-scale organic farming improves the health of the land, of individuals, and of communities everywhere. We farm because it makes sense: seeds go in the ground, food grows, we eat the food. It's simple, but at the same time unfathomably beautiful and intricate. The systems of the Connecticut landscape interact in surprising and magnificent ways when we cultivate the land. It is mysterious and yet scientific, spiritual yet academic. </p>
<p>Chickens are a part of this collaboration. Chickens scratch and peck at the dirt, loosening soils, and their manure enriches the soil and makes it better for growing plants. This is just one of nature's boons to us, and we intend to take advantage of it. </p>

The egg-collection, water, and feed are all dealt with through the facade of the coop with drawers that maximize ease and efficiency for the students on the farm.

<p>Garden Station is a whimsical community garden and art park created entirely by volunteers. We feature demonstration market/garden beds and sustainable buildings on pounded tire foundations with straw bale, bottle wall and green roof. Local artists have created murals to cover about 300' of wall as well as sculptures and mosaics. Last year we added wheelchair accessible garden plots and an outdoor kitchen for our many events and workshops. We also have helped form an urban farmer's group and ran a 23 week urban farmer's market and sustainable living workshop series, some of which was taught at UD for their sustainability week. Garden Station has been created by over 1000 volunteers and donations from over 80 local businesses and organizations with no paid staff or budget.</p>
<p>We have had events for Earth Day before but this year we would like to do a BIG event by drawing upon our workshop base and our network of partners to create a much bigger Earth Day event, the likes of which have never been seen in the Dayton area!</p>
<p>For EarthFest 2013 so far we have over 20 free workshops and 25 local organizations participating with more pending. We will have workshops on gardening, composting, seed starting, homebrewing, homemade kombucha, backyard chickens, beekeeping, solar panels, making your home more energy efficient, recycling, homemade paper, kid’s crafts from recycled items, juicing, building with cob, fermented foods, yoga AND MORE!</p>
<p>Other activities for the day include tree planting, Garden Station tours, “The Lorax” story hour, sale of local organic produce, organic non-GMO seed and plant sale, local reused craft sale and art show, info tables for local food co-ops and CSA sign ups and MORE PENDING!</p>
<p><br/>Local FOOD TRUCKS including Fressa, Harvest Mobile and ReU Juice and Smoothie Bar will be there to feed your bellies with healthy, local food!</p>
<p> ALSO The Great Cloth Diaper Change and the Really Really Free Market will be taking place during the event!</p>
<p>For more info <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/#!/events/118455538325550/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/#!/events/118455538325...</a></p>
<p>The whole purpose of the event is to provide basic, easy to use, hands on information to help our residents “go a shade greener” and make us all more self sufficient and consequently our region more resilient and reduce our carbon footprint. ALSO it can help our neighbors connect with local organizations to help them on their ongoing quest to become more sustainable and connect our organizations to each other for future collaborations and sharing of resources</p>
<p>We are looking for green-focused individuals and organizations to help sponsor the event! Your contribution will go to advertise EarthFest 2013 to the entire Miami Valley area through WYSO, DMM and more! Our Sponsors are interested in educating our residents to live in a more sustainable manner and we feel that this free community educational event is a great value that will produce great results in our community!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your gift of $300 will sponsor a classroom for 5 hours of free sustainable living workshops for EarthFest 2013 to help residents from our community “go a shade greener”!  Our workshops will be geared to give hands-on, easy to use info that can be used right away to help people become more self sufficient. The classroom will be named after you or your organization i.e. The Roy Berlin Classroom; and will appear in the program with the schedule for the day. Your Logo and or name will also appear on the event posters and website.

<p> </p></div>","Garden Station is a whimsical community garden and art park created entirely by volunteers. We feature demonstration market/garden beds and sustainable buildings on pounded tire foundations with straw bale, bottle wall and green roof. Local artists have created murals to cover about 300' of wall as well as sculptures and mosaics. Last year we added wheelchair accessible garden plots and an outdoor kitchen for our many events and workshops. We also have helped form an urban farmer's group and ran a 23 week urban farmer's market and sustainable living workshop series, some of which was taught at UD for their sustainability week. Garden Station has been created by over 1000 volunteers and donations from over 80 local businesses and organizations with no paid staff or budget.
We have had events for Earth Day before but this year we would like to do a BIG event by drawing upon our workshop base and our network of partners to create a much bigger Earth Day event, the likes of which have never been seen in the Dayton area!
For EarthFest 2013 so far we have over 20 free workshops and 25 local organizations participating with more pending. We will have workshops on gardening, composting, seed starting, homebrewing, homemade kombucha, backyard chickens, beekeeping, solar panels, making your home more energy efficient, recycling, homemade paper, kid’s crafts from recycled items, juicing, building with cob, fermented foods, yoga AND MORE!
Other activities for the day include tree planting, Garden Station tours, “The Lorax” story hour, sale of local organic produce, organic non-GMO seed and plant sale, local reused craft sale and art show, info tables for local food co-ops and CSA sign ups and MORE PENDING!
Local FOOD TRUCKS including Fressa, Harvest Mobile and ReU Juice and Smoothie Bar will be there to feed your bellies with healthy, local food!
 ALSO The Great Cloth Diaper Change and the Really Really Free Market will be taking place during the event!
For more info https://www.facebook.com/#!/events/118455538325...
The whole purpose of the event is to provide basic, easy to use, hands on information to help our residents “go a shade greener” and make us all more self sufficient and consequently our region more resilient and reduce our carbon footprint. ALSO it can help our neighbors connect with local organizations to help them on their ongoing quest to become more sustainable and connect our organizations to each other for future collaborations and sharing of resources
We are looking for green-focused individuals and organizations to help sponsor the event! Your contribution will go to advertise EarthFest 2013 to the entire Miami Valley area through WYSO, DMM and more! Our Sponsors are interested in educating our residents to live in a more sustainable manner and we feel that this free community educational event is a great value that will produce great results in our community!
 
HOW CAN YOU HELP?
 
Your gift of $300 will sponsor a classroom for 5 hours of free sustainable living workshops for EarthFest 2013 to help residents from our community “go a shade greener”!  Our workshops will be geared to give hands-on, easy to use info that can be used right away to help people become more self sufficient. The classroom will be named after you or your organization i.e. The Roy Berlin Classroom; and will appear in the program with the schedule for the day. Your Logo and or name will also appear on the event posters and website. This money will go towards advertising the event to attract more people and for printing and event expenses, not for staffing.

that a rights-based social justice and climate justice analysis is at the
forefront of the Power Shift 2013.</p>
<p>3.  Prepare
participants with the concrete skills and tools necessary to be effective at

We are, to be sure, continuing to move forward. We are incorporated in Florida, have our Board of Director's set up, bank accounts in place and paperwork in place for the IRS. It's just time.For those who missed the campaign, but still interesting supporting our cause, you can do so by cheque if you would like. Please make your check payable to:The Brechin Heritage FoundationP.O. Box 700725St. Cloud, FL 34770If you are a member of the nUIaddon.com web site, please be sure to let us know what your user name is on the site so that we can give you free access to the supporter's pages and features.Our Storyeco-geeks.org is an effort organized by gamers, geeks and everyday folks who care about the environment and is dedicated to fundraising for the purpose of purchasing approximately 445 to 2000 acres (180 - 810 hectares) of Costa Rican primary rain forest on the Golfo Dulce the bulk of which, a half a square mile to two square miles, will be transferred to the Piedras Blanca National Park in order to preserve and protect its biodiversity and wilderness for generations to come.Please choose one of our perks on the right or just make a cash contribution... do it now. Even just $5 can make a huge and lasting difference. There's no such thing as giving too little, or too much! We have a long way to go and a short time to get there. This first leg of the campaign ends November 21st. Please give now.Approximately 90 acres on the extreme western end (previously used as a cocoa and banana farm), accessible only by boat, will be set aside to create an environmentally sensitive, sustainable, off-grid eco-lodge offering unique protected access to the western extent of the Piedras Blanca National Park and the primary rain forest within it for research, education, personal exploration and those who truly appreciate nature in its wildest and most unspoiled form. Visitors to the lodge will be able to explore, study or just revel in a wide diversity of ecosystems in one place... the primary rain forest and all of the wildlife of the Piedras Blanca National Park, the open waters of the Golfo Dulce, miles of untouched volcanic shoreline, black sand beaches, and kayaking throughout the nearby mangroves and river estuaries.Be sure to check out our Facebook page at http://fb.eco-geeks.org -- we have videos of the area we're trying to acquire as well as photos and updates. You can also follow us on Twitter at http:://twitter.eco-geeks.org or Tumblr at http://tumblr.eco-geeks.orgThis project has been organized by K. Scott Piel, a loving father of four, an Army veteran of the 82nd Airborne Division, an avid gamer, author of the well known nUI addon for Blizzard's 'World of Warcraft', and a Senior Software Engineer at Presidio Networked Solutions with over 30 years experience in developing, managing and completing large technically challenging projects. Mr. Piel has contributed thousands of dollars out of pocket to this cause, has pledged 100% of the proceeds from donations for his nUI addon to the campaign costs and expenses, as well as volunteering his time, energy and expertise toward its completion. The well respected New York City architectural firm, SPG Architects, has been retained to provide site planning, sustainable architectural design schematics and ultimately to oversee the execution of the eco-lodge construction. SPG Architects brings a history and expertise in environmentally sensitive, intelligent and sustainable design to the project with practical experience developing and managing projects in Costa Rica, and the Osa in particular, as well as a demonstrable worldwide understanding of the value and balance of the ecosystems in which they build.This campaign is being executed as a purely volunteer effort with no administrative overhead outside of the overhead attributable to IndieGoGo itself and the cost of purchasing the reward items (perks) being offered to contributors. 100% of the net proceeds collected will be applied directly to the cost of professional services required to complete the effort, the purchase of the land, management and construction of the improvements and ultimately transfer of the bulk of the land to the Piedras Blanca National Park.Note that this is not a 501(c)3 non-profit and while your contributions go to a very worthy cause, they are not tax deductible.Schedule

Initial Goal

The first goal of this campaign is to raise the funds required to contract for the purchase of the land, complete the site planning, initiate the design, retain the environmental engineering expertise, perform the land surveys required to delineate exactly what land will be transferred to the Piedras Blanca National Park and otherwise set the ball in motion. Time is of the essence in this endeavor, the land is on the market and could be purchased by a developer at any time. To that end, we're seeking to raise $30,000 for the initial goal by November 21st, 2013.
Perks/Rewards
We contracted the gifted artist, and avid gamer, Arianna Edwards to produce artwork for a series of rewards (perks) for those who contribute to this campaign. This includes our eco-geeks.org logo, our heroic Pandarian Monk with his companion baby sloth (in pajamas) and a stunning fantasy art piece. These are limited edition pieces and will only be available via this campaign and its associated stretch goal campaigns.For a small contribution to the cause, we'll offer you limited edition bumper stickers, magnets, posters, hats, t-shirts and hoodies featuring Ari's art. And, just for fun, we'll pit the Horde against the Alliance... you can choose to make your contribution ""For the Horde!"" or ""For the Alliance!"" and we'll send you a perk with the appropriate slogan and add your contribution to the tally for your faction. Or, if you prefer, you can remain neutral and we'll send you your perk with the slogan ""Because we care!"" and add your contribution to the tally for Pandaria.For a preview of our branded perks, have a look at these links...

In addition to our immediate perks, we'll also offer longer term perks for larger contributions toward the stretch goals... you can choose to prepay for a one, three, five or seven night visit to the lodge at 25% to 50% off of the planned rate, or choose to be a benefactor and get the right to help name the lodge and guest houses, participate in the theming of guest houses and buyout the entire lodge for weeks at a time. Any contributions toward the stretch goal perks will be carried into the second campaign and delivered upon its completion according the schedule outlined above.

Every dollar makes a difference so please give generously!

Stretch Goals
While we would hope to be incredibly successful in our pursuit of the Initial Goal, we do not expect to achieve or complete any of the stretch goals identified, below, in 
the first round (which is not to say we wouldn't love to!). However, we want to set out the long term goals and ensure everyone understands we're setting the bar very high. That said, at the completion of the first round of fundraising on 
November 21st, 100% of the contributions made over and above the primary goal will be 
carried forward into a new campaign and all of the associated perks will be honored.Stretch Goal #1
Upon completion of the Initial Goal, the second goal is to complete the purchase of the land. It's an exceptionally ambitious goal. We seek to raise $1.5 million to cover the purchase price of the land and the attending legal costs, taxes and expenses to close the sale.While we would hope to be wildly successful in our pursuit of the Initial Goal, we do not expect to achieve any of these stretch goals in 
the first round. At the completion of the first round of fundraising on 
November 21st, all contributions received over and above the primary goal amount of $30,000 will be 
carried forward into a new longer term campaign beginning with Stretch Goal #1 for the purchase of the land and all perks earned in the first round will be honored or carried forward into the second campaign as appropriate.Stretch Goal #2

The second stretch goal is to improve the access to the land by creating a small, self-sustaining, off-grid, eco-lodge on 31 acres near the coastline. We have a budget of $500,000 to build six comfortable eco-friendly guest accommodations and a central common space for on-site staff, meals, recreation, research, meetings and classroom. The lodge will be located in the maritime zone (between 50 meters and 200 meters from mean high tide) along the coast of the Golfo Dulce without cutting trees or damaging the rain forest. This is an area without road access and all materials and labor will have to be packed in by boat and raw muscle power. With that in mind, a budget of $50,000 per unit for six guest quarters and $200,000 for the central lodge has be established to include the production and storage of renewable energy, passive cooling and sustainable construction.This development will provide a comfortable and functional space from which access to the western extent of the Piedras Blanca National Park can be attained along with the open waters of the Golfo Dulce, its mangroves and surrounding estuaries. Using local materials and goods, local labor, local craftsmen and renewable energy sources, the lodge will serve as an environmentally responsible vantage from which people can study, observe, explore and experience the beauty, diversity and remarkable value of the unspoiled wilderness and its boundless wildlife throughout the Golfo Dulce and the Piedras Blanca National Forest. This space is intended as a bridge between the wild untouched environment around it and the basic comforts necessary to make it accessible to those who need to see it but might otherwise never do so.
Stretch Goal #3

In the event that we are wildly successful in the long term, we have set aside a third and even more aggressive stretch goal: there is a second parcel of land consisting of approximately 1000 nearly inaccessible acres of astonishingly beautiful and scenic cloud forest owned by a talented frontiersman/carpenter and currently on the market.This incomparable piece of land is located within an Indian reservation, however, it is scheduled to be surveyed by the government of Costa Rica and will likely be removed from the reservation and titled with an access road constructed which, in turn, would open it up to commercial development. The third stretch goal seeks to raise an additional $1.5 million to purchase this parcel of land and convert it to a conservancy in order to preserve its beauty, its biodiversity and its wilderness. Having already had masterpieces in wood lovingly hand built on the land, there's little else needed to make this a haven for exploring and studying the true wilderness of Costa Rica or just getting away from the push and shove of modern life and reconnecting with what is really important in your life.If we hit the second stretch goal during the campaign, we'll extend the perks offered to include guest stays at this remarkable location.In our wildest dreams, there are several other large parcels of primary rain forest totaling over a square mile bordering the Piedras Blanca National Park that we could seek to add to the land we'll be transferring to the park. We'll talk more about that at a later time if our success on these first goals justifies it.The Impact
At the minimum, we'll transfer a half a square mile of precious primary rain forest from private hands to a national park where the wilderness and all of the life it holds will be protected perpetually from development, logging, deforestation, hunting, trapping and abuse.
In doing so, we will have created a remarkable sanctuary where people can come to experience the wonder of it all, study its life, understand its value and come to appreciate its intrinsic beauty and how truly precious a commodity it is.

<h2>WHY BIO-SAND WATER FILTERS?</h2>
<h2>Bio-sand water filters are cheap, effective, long-lasting, and require very little maintenance. </h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cheap:</strong> $32 purchases not only a water filter (like one shown below that we helped install in March) but also provides education to the families who receive them,  the assembly and installation of those water filters, and helps to hire a community activist for the year who provides education and monitoritoring services for a village.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Effective:</strong>The biosand filter has been studied in the field and in labs. Accoring to the Center for Affordable Water and Sanitation Health Technologies, they have been shown to remove the following from contaminated water:
<ul>
<li>Up to 100% of helminths (worms)</li>
<li>Up to 100% of protozoa</li>
<li>Up to 98.5% of bacteria</li>
<li>70-99% of viruses</li>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Long-Lasting and Low-Maintenance:</strong> These filters are designed to last 25-30 years.  As you can see from the explanation above (used with permission from the Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology), the parts of bio-sand filters are really simple and cheap.  Theyre basically just concrete containers filled with different sizes of sand and gravel.</li>

<h3><b>The Earth Home Solution</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The  Earth Home or Earth Ship was invented by licensed architect Mike Reynolds about 40 years ago and he and his team have been perfecting it ever since. Learn more about it here or read below. <a href=""http://earthship.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://earthship.com</a> </p>
<p>The solution is simple; to make our homes into living, breathing, high-functioning <i><b>parts</b> </i>of our planet. A home that takes the best human-made technologies and integrates them with the natural phenomenon of our planet. </p>
<p>The primary structure of the Earth ship is built with <i>used </i>tires, cans, and bottles. Huge mountains of tires hazardously take up large portions of land. As they heat up, they also give off poisonous gases. With the Earth ship, we begin to  these mountains AND prevent the emission of unhealthy gases.  <br/></p>

*** Quick Note: This Earth Home or Earth Ship WILL be built. We chose Flex-funding because we need ANY amount. Our goal amount would definitely be the BEST option, but we are going to do what needs to be done either way. You WILL receive your perk.  The more money we raise here, the less we will have to from other potential avenues such as loans and investors.  The more we can make it community based, the more we can all enjoy it without having to turn this into a money-making machine. Let's do this!
Within 48 hours of purchasing your PERK you will receive a legally binding contract which will state that if you do not receive access to your PERK within 2 years, you will receive a full refund.  

The the health of our Earth and it's people's is deteriorating. Deforestation, mountains of trash, the burning of fossil fuels, and deadly water shortages have driven the world into environmental and social instability.  We wholeheartedly aim to change this reality.  If you help us...we will.    


Three Problems, Three Solutions



Problem: Americans generate 250 million pounds of trash EVERY year that collect in our oceans and landfills.  Solution: An earth ship utilizes trashed materials for its structure.                             




   2.  Problem: The U.S. gets 84% of its energy from non-renewable fossil fuels.      Solution:  An earth ship relies on renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and thermal mass.                



3. Problem:  By 2025  1.8 Billion people will experience absolute water scarcity. Currently the average American family uses 400 gal. of water per day! 
Solution:  The Earth Ship uses every drop of its passively collected rainwater 3-4 times before returning it to the earth.       
         
     Knowing how to solve a problem is only half the battle. Active and Continual change is imperative. Take action with us to encourage intelligent and sustainable practices so to achieve a smarter, healthier, and happier world! 


             ""What the world needs now is a billion of these, immediately.""                                                                                         Engineer when meeting with Michael Reynolds


The Earth Home Solution


The  Earth Home or Earth Ship was invented by licensed architect Mike Reynolds about 40 years ago and he and his team have been perfecting it ever since. Learn more about it here or read below. http://earthship.com 
The solution is simple; to make our homes into living, breathing, high-functioning parts of our planet. A home that takes the best human-made technologies and integrates them with the natural phenomenon of our planet. 
The primary structure of the Earth ship is built with used tires, cans, and bottles. Huge mountains of tires hazardously take up large portions of land. As they heat up, they also give off poisonous gases. With the Earth ship, we begin to  these mountains AND prevent the emission of unhealthy gases.  



The tires are a passive thermal mass heating and cooling system for the home, regulating the temperature of the home to a comfortable 71  degrees, year round.

How does it work? The sun and surrounding Earth...that's it.  Science rules. 




  

Instant Gratification for Joining our Mission


We have
the idea, passion, work-ethic, and the time to create this amazing place. We don't have the money. This is where your monetary donations will
enable us to make it happen. 

Ultimately, we need donations for the actualization of the Earth Home. But
before we can build anything, we need to purchased the land.  Over the past few months we have been searching for the perfect piece of land on which to build this sustainable home.  We have found a beautiful parcel of land in the mountains of Colorado, 8 miles south of the Breckenridge slopes!   

To ""Own"" the Land

Fantastically enough, this piece of land is remarkably well priced (currently priced
at $49,000 for .55 acre) compared to most land in the area. Our Earth Home
design fits perfectly into this land where most bigger, conventional homes
would not. This has driven the price of the land down, enabling the Earth Ship
project to exist in prime real estate at a fraction of the cost!

Of course you will be funding a cause you believe in, but our perk system is great
motivation in itself. Donate a bit, your name is forever etched in the walls of the home, donate a lot and you get a great deal on a stay in Colorado's tourism hot spot! 





Fostering Education

The Earthship can be an example of hyper-sustainable living for our community.  Those who stay in the home might simply be interested in enjoying outdoor activities in Colorado, but they will also receive education (passively or actively) about what sustainable living looks and feels like.  We believe this type of education is very powerful.  Sustainable living principles remain abstract to many in our culture and this will bring a practical reality to the mix.

The more our community helps with the development of this project, the more we can focus on building this community and the less we need to focus on paying back . 

Our community will be active in providing guided retreats focused on Yoga, meditation, adventure, sports, Permaculture, (as well as other gardening practices) nature and sustainability. We have a team of people who are passionate about these disciplines and bringing them to others. 

   Being Change, Sustaining Change

Without impacting the Earth, this project will impact friends and family of our community in a way that encourages lifestyles/practices that consider the people and Earth around them.  Many people already do practice such lifestyles, this will make it easier, more enjoyable, and more accessible to those who want to take a more active role towards such goals.   Along with the Home, comes adventure. As a family passionate about creating fun,education, and happiness; Karli, Daniel, and Ryan are all excited to offer such things to anyone who visits this lovely spot in Colorado.Yoga, climbing, exploration, permaculture education , and sustainable living are but a fraction of the things available to anyone interested in this projects community. 

It doesn't stop there. We will continually add Earth Homes to the geography of our world, constantly expanding the range of intelligent holistic influence.  So many of us are willing to change the world....simply looking for opportunities to be that change.  So lets do it.

Of the million travelers that visited Armenia in 2015, less than 1% actually made the journey that far south. </b>Thousands each year are missing out on a big part of Armenia's nature and culture, but most importantly, the rural communities and villages in Syunik are not taking part in the economic benefits that accompany tourism.

What's That?

We’re raising funds ($3,709, to be exact) to mark and map a network of hiking trails that will invite the adventurous, modern tourist to explore more of Syunik and meaningfully engage with Armenia's people and its landscapes.

<h3>Let us introduce ourselves:</h3>
<p>Before Environment Canada, there existed the <a href=""www.environmentalsociety.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Saskatchewan Environmental Society</a>! <b>SES is a non-profit organization</b> that has been working towards a sustainable future since 1970. SES has established a reputation for sound science, good management, civility, and an ability to work collaboratively. The people who work and volunteer for SES are passionate and well-educated individuals who care deeply about the environment and know that a sustainable future is only possible with support for and support from their broader community. Our work is varied and diverse, and <b>for years, we have pondered ways to make solar power a viable option in Saskatchewan. </b>This is where the idea to develop <b>Saskatchewan’s FIRST solar power cooperative </b>was born. Saskatchewan is fortunate to have an outstanding sunlight resource - the best among all of Canada’s provinces. </p>
<p></p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Our plan is to establish a cooperative that will install and operate a 100 kilowatt solar farm, that will house 400 solar photovoltaic panels, in the Saskatoon region. <b>This solar power farm will successfully meets the electricity needs of its members in a way that is:</b></p>

<p>If that doesn't sound exciting enough, members of the cooperative will cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 121 tonnes per year. That is the equivalent of <b>1326 </b>trees, which is huge! </p>
<p>A solar power cooperative is also an incredibly unique concept, as it provides people who would not normally have the ability to install solar panels on their home, the opportunity to invest in a renewable tomorrow. Do you live in a condo? Do you rent? Do you plan on moving to a different home in a couple of years? Have you always wanted to have renewable energy, but don't know where to start because the paperwork and installation seem overwhelming? </p>
<p><b>These are all reasons to invest. </b></p>
<p>The co-op will also take care of all maintenance, which means you won't be the one sweeping the snow off your panel(s) every time it snows. The convenience factor of this cooperative is tremendous! </p>
<p></p>

</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>2. How will the cooperative be run?</b><br/>Everyone who purchases a solar panel will belong to the solar power cooperative and will have a say in decision making.  This will be the first solar power cooperative in Saskatchewan.<br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>3. How much does one solar panel unit cost? </b><br/>When you include the cost of the solar panel, and the solar panel’s share of other installed costs such as the inverters and hookup to the power grid, buying a panel unit will cost $900. The additional cost in the perk section (to the right) is to provide additional funding to the solar power cooperative project. </span></div>
<div>
<b>4. Will investors recover their panel costs over time?</b><br/>No.  At the current price SaskPower pays under the Small Power Producers Program, we estimate investors will get between $650 and $700 of their investment back over 25 years.   
</div>
<div>

</div>
<div>
<b>9. Why invest in solar? </b><br/>
<p>Approximately half of our electricity in Saskatchewan currently comes from coal, a very dirty source of power. Solar power emits only a small fraction of the greenhouse gas pollution associated with electricity produced from coal and natural gas. Solar power fits nicely into an urban landscape. It works in cold temperatures, as long as the collectors are kept free of snow. It also compliments our existing wind power resources. For example, while solar production takes place during daylight hours, wind power production often peaks at night. What's more, the cost of solar electric technology is rapidly dropping. If we want to build a renewable power future for Saskatchewan, the building blocks need to be put into place now. </p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions, Answered!</h1>
<p><b>Does this hurt the owls?</b></p>
<p>The last thing we want to do is put snowy owls at risk. The capture process is quick and harmless, and backpack harnesses and lightweight transmitters similar to what we're using have been shown to have no effect on either the survival rate or breeding success of these owls. (see reference 1)</p>
<p>A lot of people worry that snowy owls in these irruptions are forced down here by hunger, are must be slowly starving to death. So this must stress them, right? In fact, our research has found that most of the irrupting snowy owls are healthy, with normal weight and fat reserves. If we catch an owl that's underweight or shows signs of illness, we obviously won't tag it.</p>
<p>Some of the thousands of snowy owls in this irruption will certainly perish, but most of those will succumb to vehicle collisions (including with planes, since many hang out at airports), rodenticide poisoning, electrocution on power lines and other unnatural hazards. In fact, our project will help us better understand what threatens snowy owls on the wintering grounds, because we're working with wildlife health specialists to test them for toxins, and to perform necropsies on those that are found dead.</p>
<p>1. Therrien, J-F., G. Gauthier and J. Bêty. 2012. Survival and reproduction of adult snowy owls tracked by satellite. <i>Journal of Wildlife Management</i> 76(8):1562-1567.</p>
<p><b>Since these are GPS-GSM transmitters, what happens when the bird is out of cellular coverage?</b></p>
<p>The transmitters use signals from the orbiting GPS satellite system to regularly collect precise information about the bird's location, at preset intervals around the clock, then transmits it once or twice a day via the cellular network. If the bird is outside cell range, the transmitters can store up to 100,000 locations - potentially years' worth, since we can reprogram the units remotely once the owls are ready to head back to the Arctic. They will continue to transmit as they head through southern Canada - and if they come anywhere within cell range in future winters, in places like Newfoundland, southern Labrador or the Canadian prairies, we'll get an enormous trove of data, collected via GPS during their time in the Arctic.<br/><b><br/>What does the “high resolution” data look like?</b><br/>The degree of accuracy of this data is beyond anything available with older satellite transmitters. When the transmitter is triangulating its position from several GPS satellites, it can provide a location accurate to a fraction of a meter. Viewing the data through Google Earth, we've been able to tell (and confirm with ground observers) that an owl was perched on a particular piling in a dock, or the south side (rather than the north side) of the roof of a beachfront house.</p>
<p><a href=""http://celltracktech.com/index.php/products/wildlife-telemetry-solutions/ctt-1000-series/ctt-1040-1060/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read more about the transmitters we are using.</a></p>
<p><b><br/>How can this data tell us anything about foraging behavior?</b><br/>As we test the capabilities of these transmitters, and especially the overnight life of the solar-charged battery, we're steadily reducing the interval at which we program the units to take GPS locations. This ever-finer-grained data is giving us our first look at the nocturnal life of snowy owls, especially where and when they're hunting. One of the surprises already has been how much time coastal birds spend hunting offshore, presumably preying on sleeping ducks. Similarly, we've been able to see how inland birds are using irrigation ditches, roadsides and other habitat for their hunting. Because these transmitters communicate by cell phone, we can reprogram them on the fly - literally - with instructions to increase or decrease the number of fixes we want them to take.</p>
<p><b>How will this translate into real conservation activities?</b><br/>Up to now, no one has really known much at all about the winter behavior of snowy owls, especially after dark. Questions we hope to answer include where these irruptive birds are coming from; how far and how fast they move across the landscape during the winter; what kinds of habitats they're using, and how that differs from daytime to darkness; and what threats they face while here in the south, including what their fate may be following a big irruption.  These transmitters provide the first look at the behavior of individual wintering snowy owls in a way that will shed light on many aspects of their ecology, which will ultimately better inform conservation efforts. And this tracking program is just part of a larger study to look at multiple aspects of their ecology and physiology.</p>
<p><b>How are these transmitters mounted to the birds, and would they impair their wing movements?</b><br/>The transmitters are held in place with a kind of backpack harness, made of low-friction Teflon® tape, that is a design that's been used for decades on many birds of prey, including large owls. Similar harnesses have been used with satellite transmitters on snowy owls, with no effect on the owls' survival or breeding success. They certainly do not restrict their flight - the first owl we tagged flew nearly 200 miles in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><b>Will you be banding any owls in Florida, the Carolinas and Georgia (if they show up that far south)?</b></p>
<p>The farthest-south snowies present a couple of issues. One is simply that these birds are enormous birding celebrities, attracting a tremendous amount of attention from the birding community, media and general public. But more significantly, there seems to be evidence that the snowies that move far, far out of range are also going to be the most physiologically stretched, and may be at greater risk from ailments like aspergillosis that are less of a hazard in more northerly climes, and in birds that haven't been pushed as far.</p>
<p>We are actually torn about what to do about these owls. There's the assumption that their survival rate isn't good, but then, that used to be the assumption about snowies in places like the Northeast, where (thanks to banding and telemetry by Norman Smith and Tom McDonald) we now know they have a very high survival and return rate. Tagging one of the southern birds might help answer that question. But if we tagged one of those birds and something happened to it - even if it wasn't associated with the tagging - it's likely there would be a lot of recrimination and anger from people who would reflexively blame the research. At the moment the point is moot, because we don't have any collaborating researchers or agencies in those southern locations interested in tagging snowies.</p>

What is Project SNOWstorm
 
Created in the winter of 2013-14 to study the largest invasion of snowy owls in the East in nearly a century, Project SNOWstorm is a unique collaboration of more than 40 scientists, bird-banders and wildlife health professionals, all working as volunteers. This winter, with a second major irruption taking shape (especially in the Midwest), our team is expanding its research into this beautiful and mysterious raptor, using state-of-the-art telemetry, banding, DNA and isotope analysis, toxicology screening and more -- all funded by the public.There's a lot more about this project and its goals at projectsnowstorm.org.

What We Do, and How You Can Help 
Last winter, the Indiegogo community gave us the opportunity to launch SNOWstorm in record time -- and with breathtaking results. We tagged 22 snowy owls, from Minnesota to Massachusetts, using GPS/GSM transmitters. Through interactive, near-real-time maps, donors were able to track the wanderings of these birds along with us, in unprecedented, 3D detail -- as they hunted sea ducks at night over the open Atlantic Ocean, or traveled far out into the frozen expanses of the Great Lakes.In spring, the tagged owls moved back to the Arctic -- and some of them are now returning south, downloading a treasure-trove of stored data detailing their travels through the remote Canadian North.Because irruptions are usually sporadic, we expected a quite winter this year. Instead, thousands of snowy owls have again invaded the Great Lakes, northern prairies and Northeast -- and we need your help to continue this ground-breaking study. We hope to tag an additional 15-20 snowy owls this winter, and expand the other research we've begun.

What Your Contribution Does 
Every penny of your contribution goes straight into the research -- no one associated with SNOWstorm is taking any kind of stipend or salary.The transmitters are the most expensive element. Even with an extremely generous discount from the manufacturer, Cellular Tracking Technologies, they still cost $3,000 each.

<h3>For The Bees<br/>
</h3>
<p>Denton Apiaries seeks to help save the dwindling honey bee population by building a small scale, environmentally beneficial apiary (bee farm). Our goal is to approach bee keeping from a natural bee friendly, or apicentric, fashion in order to provide a healthy environment for honey bees. With a local, bee friendly keeping method, we hope to be a small yet effective part of protecting honey bees. <br/><br/>Our methods include:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Using Top Bar Hives to help facilitate a more natural environment for the bees.<br/>
</li>
<li>Refraining from using chemicals, miticides or other unnatural methods often employed in commercial bee keeping.</li>
<li>Harvesting honey in a bee friendly manner. Seeing ourselves as stewards of the bees rather than ""owners.""<br/>
</li>
<li>Packaging our honey and honey products in raw and natural ways, without commercial processing.</li>
<li>Being resourceful with all of our bee products and honey products. Recycling honey comb and wax into usable products such as soaps and candles.</li>

<p>We really don't need much! Here's a brief summary of what we need to make this project a reality:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Top Bar Hives for the apiary. Each Top Bar Hive is approximately $100. We hope to purchase a total of 6 new hives.</li>
<li>A website from which to sell our products, including an option to subscribe to regular honey and honey product deliveries (lower 48 US states only).</li>

The honey produced by our bees will not be commercially processed. It will be all natural and raw, maintaining the health benefits that are inherent to honey.

The honey bee population is dwindling globally. Even small gestures to help reverse that are invaluable.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Irish Seed Savers Association was set up in 1991 to save Ireland's heritage and heirloom vegetable seeds, potatoes, grains and fruit trees from extinction.</p>
<p>Since then we have grown and grown and now have over 800 varieties of organic, open pollinated heritage seeds in our purpose built Seed Bank, together with the country's key orchards which hold the native Apple Tree Collection <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">together with the country's only self-rooting orchard</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> here at Irish Seed Savers in County Clare. We also have over 50 varieties of potatoes, which is extremely important given Ireland's history of the Potato Famine, which occurred due to the devastation caused by potato blight; a virus which continues to devastate potato crops today. Then, almost everyone in Ireland grew only one variety, the Lumper potato, and that variety was destroyed by the blight which led to the Great famine. The Bute variety (grown in County Kerry) survived and saved countless souls. We now know that diversification of varieties prevents famines, but yet the world still suffers from famines and we still don't learn.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately Irish Seed Savers, like many others have experienced a number of severe cuts over the past number of years and this together with the economic downturn  means that despite our best efforts the continued operations and very survival of Irish Seed Savers is in jeopardy. We have achieved a lot over the past number of years. We have created 20 beautiful acres of Organic Heritage Orchards, Seed Gardens and Woodlands for visitors. We have built Ireland's first National Seed Bank, open to the public, and making seed available to all. It is a living gene-bank,  where 800 varieties of heirloom seeds together with their stories have been collected and carefully grown out to bulk up the numbers. We share our skills and knowledge on seed saving and other sustainable living skills to thousands of children and adults through workshops, courses, camps and outreach programmes. This knowledge and seed base means that Ireland continues to have some control over its future food security in times of continued industrialisation of food and diminishing resources worldwide. Unless we all have the right and the opportunity to grow our own seed, save our own seed and share our seed we don't have food security. Empowering people to do that and save the heritage and heirloom varieties which grow best in Ireland, is what Irish Seed Savers does best. </p>
<p>Please hep us continue. This appeal is to YOU, our friends and supporters and through you to all those interested in securing a sustainable future for Irish Seed Savers and the important work it undertakes on behalf of the people of Ireland.<br/></p> <p></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need a total of €250,000 ($333,000)  to ensure our survival and we need to raise €100,000 ($133,000) of this on Indiegogo. The money will be used as follows <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>€50,000 ($67,000) will be used to buy raw materials like rootstocks, pots, compost, tools, shop supplies so that we can grow our own sales and improve our future sustainability by making our seeds and trees available to YOU.<br/>
</li>
<li>€50,000 ($67,000) will be used to finish our Seed Bank and ensure we make full use of this wonderful new building, the only one of its kind in Ireland </li>
<li>€100,000 ($133,000) will be used to buy our land outright so that we are not at the mercy of higher interest charges<br/>
</li>
<li>€50,000 will be held as a cash reserve so that we can manage our cashflow during the year to allow for the seasonality of our sales.</li>
<li>Whatever we raise we will spend in the order outlined above so that if for example we only raise €100,000 of our goal we will first secure our raw material for future years and complete our Seed Bank.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It has been reported that since the 1950's, Europe has lost 80% of its food varieties. That means that we have managed to save 20% from extinction. Despite history, we continue to suffer from famine and the devastation of mono culture. Our food source, the simple seed, is not yet secure. It would be devastating if Irish Seed Savers were to close after so much hard work by so many people, staff, volunteers and supporters. We really need to keep Irish Seed Savers alive so that we can preserve all of our open pollinated seeds, fruit trees and potatoes for future generations. We also need to preserve the knowledge of seed saving and other vital sustainable living skills.<br/></p>
<p>We have grown from very small beginnings to the saving of up to 800 varieties of open pollinated vegetable seeds 140 cultivars of apples trees and 50 varieties of potatoes as well as sharing our knowledge with thousands of children and adults . <br/></p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<div>My name is Christena Wilcox and I am a senior at Central Michigan University, majoring in Outdoor and Environmental Recreation. My desire to volunteer and travel has become possible when I was accepted to the International Student Volunteer program. However, traveling abroad is costly, and I'm asking for your sponsorship to make this opportunity possible. I wish to travel to South Africa where I will embark on a two week volunteer project helping out with the conservation of endangered species and habitats, protecting fragile ecosystems, and much more. Following the volunteer project is a 2 week adventure tour where I will dive into the rich culture of South Africa.</div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The personal impact of this volunteer opportunity would be great, knowing the feeling of true contribution and making a difference. But most importantly is the positive impact made on the environment and endangered species in need of help. I feel that this is a truly remarkable opportunity that would stick with me for life. Along with the environmental aspect of this all, I will also be aiding in community development and working with local families and children. From aiding with health and education programs and and protecting fragile ecosystems, to creating a community garden so there is means of sustainable food production, the impact will be tremendous. </div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>The cost of the four week volunteer program is $3,695.00, not including airfare. Through your generous donations, bottle drives, hard work and persistence, I hope to reach this goal so I am able to pursue this opportunity in the summer of 2012. If all of the money is not raised in time, I will continue to work towards my goal so I can go during the summer of 2013. The program cost includes all accommodations, most meals, park entrance fees, and ground transportation while in the host country. </div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>Please know that any support offered will help out. You are not only helping me, but changing the lives of others that I will be able to help through this program. Spread the word! You can share this on facebook, twitter, email...Please help me get the word out!</div>

</div></div>","Who we are & What we’re doing 
Eco- Lifestyles L3C is a hybrid green business located in New Orleans, La that provides eco-guidance and develops innovative eco-projects to help individuals, businesses, & communities’ transition into a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. Presently, we're planning a multi-dimensional competition for October 23, 2011 along with a host of cultural, environmental, & sports related preliminary events starting on April 22, 2011. Our mission is to highlight the Natural Eco-Friendly Man with all of his Diverse Qualities!
THE PURPOSE is to popularize healthier and sustainable living among the black community starting with black males who are constantly subjected to negative profiling & stereotyping views. That hinders or prevents them from obtaining fair & equitable opportunities in the education, job, and housing sectors. 
 
THE DOUBLE BENEFIT is that it not only provides contestants with pertinent environmental info, experiences, and exposure; but the competition also serves as a platform for on-going awareness & interest in the survivability of the ""San Bushmen"" People of Southern Africa, earth's oldest eco-friendly homo-sapiens; which is why we chose to title the competition after them. And plus, their imposed name is perfectly suited for our target market- which is intended for, but not limited to Black males (ages 21-35) who embrace their ethnic & natural  identity by wearing their hair in a Bush/Afro, Dreads/Locks, Braids, or Plaits. Additionally, we’ve come to find that they both share in cultural & identity struggles when attempting to live a natural lifestyle. 
 F.Y.I- Monies raised will support the on-going production of this annual competition with 25% of event merchandise proceeds donated to the legal & cultural battles being waged on behalf of the Bushmen people's right to their ancestral lands. Let's all commit to the preservation of eco-sustainable Human Cultures & their ways - at home & abroad! To find out more about the importance of the Bushmen people, their land, and their culture go to our fb page: Save The Bushmen & Their Land. For their plight is also our plight! 
 

 
What We Need & What You Get 
To successfully launch our eco-campaign & competition, we need to raise an estimated $22,000, or 2/3 of our total budget to cover major expenses. These expenses are the following: production staff & supplies, multi-media marketing, merchandising, venue(s), preliminary events, staging design. If our financial goal is not reached within the intended deadline, we will postpone the project until we reach our targeted goal.

What is the Guatemala Project?
Several years ago, the then director of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) projects in Latin America asked Daniel for his help with the Scarlet Macaw Project. Since then, Daniel has visited the WCS station in the Mayan Biosphere twice to bring medical supplies and teach the WCS workers and veterinarians about macaw husbandry and chick rearing.

<h3>About GINEPRO ENERGIA...</h3>
<p>Emanuele Giacomelli was born in 1963 in Tuscany Italy.</p>
<p>Since he was a child he dreamt of ways of obtaining energy from renewable sources. His earliest experiment was placing a metal strip on the top of a tree connected to a condenser. Luckily for him no lightning hit the metal strip so he is still here to continue with his passion.</p>
<p>He has never believed in perpetual motion, but has tried to separate the water in hydrogen and oxygen and to feed an internal combustion engine using the electricity produced by the engine itself. Giving the illusion that the engine runs for ever, the deception is the engine only turns whilst the battery has power.</p>
<p>He has also tried to obtain methylic alcohol and methane from fire wood to feed an internal combustion engine. He has studied how to maintain both warm and cold thermal energy, gathering material on the technique of ice boxes which maintained ice for a period of over one year.</p>
<p>He often uses an electric bike and would love to see more cars running on electric power as he considers electricity more efficient than hydrogen, biogas or vegetable fuels.</p>
<p>He is interested in wood housebuilding, convinced that the best performances in energetic saving are buildings in wood, but only from the first stage and over.</p>
<p>In the past 12 years he has delighted children with his shows, creating giant soap bubbles of over 140 cm. (You can see this at <a href=""http://www.archimago.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.archimago.org</a>).</p>
<p>Covering his subjects in the giant bubbles, however if the wind was too strong he soon discovered that the show would be ruined. From this observation he then designed a turbine structure based on a tree that moved with the minimum wind force. This structure is 7 meters high and has been carefully studied for optimum performance but still needs approved testing and patenting. It then needs to go into production and calculating the cost of material and work prior to marketing. </p>

1 box heavy-duty trash bags, 22-27 count (33-35 gallon size bags)
1 bottle insect repellent (drops or lotion, not aerosol), 6-14 oz.

The Impact
Although larger organizations such as the American Red Cross will most likely be assisting with shelter, food and health care, there is a need for supplies for property owners to use once the waters recede. These kits will allow homeowners and businesses to clean up their properties and allow for sanitary conditions.
Any monies collected above and beyond what is needed for the clean-up buckets will be given to the Corral Bar to pay for damages caused by the flooding.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our History


Founded in 1998 by Chris Sharpe in order to produce a ‘Bird Atlas’ for the Isle of Man, a comprehensive study of populations of all species, published in 2007. It greatly improved knowledge on and conservation strategy for the island’s birds.

Chris’s perseverance led to production of ‘The Isle of Man – A Natural World’ film. As you can see from the trailer at the top of the page, it showcases the spectacular wildlife of the island superbly.

We would be immensely grateful for you to give whatever you can to help build on our legacy and achieve more in conservation.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<li>The formula is simple, the ingredients are simple, and WATER is the magic ingredient.  WATER is the KEY to our energy crisis and the global warming crisis.</li>
<li>One of my most profound moments was when I realized that Hydrogen was the only atom without a neutron, thus providing a direct route to GOD.</li>

<h3><font><font>Short Summary</font></font></h3>
<p><b><font><font>Who we are</font></font></b></p>
<p><font><font class="""">Carly Hutchinson and Ilsa
Jule are the co-founders of Anahata Nature Sanctuary &amp; Learning Center located
in North Central Massachusetts. Collectively, we have 11 years of homesteading
and farming experience. We have spent the past five years overseeing four
sustainable forestry and wildlife conservation projects at Anahata. Ilsa, in
addition to her experience as a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) or direct
farm-to-consumer distributor and market farmer, is certified in wildlife
rescue. We also have received three competitive USDA conservation grants over
the past five years.</font></font></p>
<p><b><font><font>Why our campaign is
important</font></font></b></p>
<p><font><font class="""">Our current project focuses
on preserving 48 acres of pristine woodland that is slated for a 10-home
subdivision. We want to purchase this land and make it open to the public as a
wildlife sanctuary. We also want to start a learning center there and offer
educational programming that provides people of all ages and backgrounds with rewarding
connections to the natural world. </font></font></p>
<p><font><font>We need to raise $50,350 to
save this land and start our nature sanctuary and learning center. </font></font></p>
<p><b><font><font>Why your investment in
Anahata is important:</font></font></b></p>
<p><font><font>·</font><b><font>Trees are really good for our air quality!</font></b><font> Did you know that 10% of all Massachusetts carbon
dioxide emissions are taken in by the existing trees there?</font></font><span> 
</span><b><font></font></b><font></font></p>
<p><font><font class="""">·</font></font><font><font class="""">The bad news is
that more than </font></font><b><font><font class="""">50% of forests in New
England States will be developed</font></font></b><font><font class="""">. Each year, several square miles of
forestland are developed in Massachusetts, resulting in both the outright loss
of habitat for plants and animals, and a lower quality remaining habitat as
forestlands are fragmented into smaller patches.</font></font></p>
<p><font><font>·</font><b><font>Deforestation is a national problem so every acre we
save is a plus</font></b><font>. The US Department of
Agriculture projects that in 40 years we will have almost 400,000 fewer acres
of forest in the US. Did you know that </font><b><font>US
forests are decreasing faster than those in Brazil</font></b><font>? Check out this link to
learn more: </font></font><span>

<p><font><font class="""">·</font><b><font class="""">And that's just the beginning of why it matters. </font></b><font class="""">A growing body of research shows that our mental,
physical and spiritual health is directly linked to our association with
nature.</font></font><span> 
</span><b><font></font></b><font></font></p>
<p><font><font class="""">·</font></font><font><font class="""">In a world with
less leisure time, the amount of time we all spend inside in front of a TV
or computer screen has created something that author Richard Louv calls
""Nature Deficit Disorder""—this means that children, families, even
entire communities, have a diminished use of their senses, attention
difficulties and higher rates of physical and emotional illnesses.</font></font></p>
<p></p>
<h3><font><font>What We Need &amp; What You
Get</font></font></h3>
<p><font><font class="""">Our $50,350 goal will allow
us to purchase the first section of the 48 acres of land that is slated for
development; get Anahata off the ground with a legal organizational structure; and begin
our Learning Center programming. Here's the breakdown:</font></font></p>
<p><u><font><font>Budget:</font></font></u></p>
<ul>
<li><font><font>Two building lots of the 48-acre parcel (3.5
     acres)*: $35,000</font></font></li>
<li><font><font>Land appraisal for full 48 acres: $2,700</font></font></li>
<li><font><font>Non-profit organizational status [501(c)(3)]:
     $5,850</font></font></li>
<li><font><font>Limited Liability Company (LLC) for profit-based

Who we are
Carly Hutchinson and Ilsa
Jule are the co-founders of Anahata Nature Sanctuary & Learning Center located
in North Central Massachusetts. Collectively, we have 11 years of homesteading
and farming experience. We have spent the past five years overseeing four
sustainable forestry and wildlife conservation projects at Anahata. Ilsa, in
addition to her experience as a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) or direct
farm-to-consumer distributor and market farmer, is certified in wildlife
rescue. We also have received three competitive USDA conservation grants over
the past five years.
Why our campaign is
important
Our current project focuses
on preserving 48 acres of pristine woodland that is slated for a 10-home
subdivision. We want to purchase this land and make it open to the public as a
wildlife sanctuary. We also want to start a learning center there and offer
educational programming that provides people of all ages and backgrounds with rewarding
connections to the natural world. 
We need to raise $50,350 to
save this land and start our nature sanctuary and learning center. 
Why your investment in
Anahata is important:
·Trees are really good for our air quality! Did you know that 10% of all Massachusetts carbon
dioxide emissions are taken in by the existing trees there? 

·The bad news is
that more than 50% of forests in New
England States will be developed. Each year, several square miles of
forestland are developed in Massachusetts, resulting in both the outright loss
of habitat for plants and animals, and a lower quality remaining habitat as
forestlands are fragmented into smaller patches.
·Deforestation is a national problem so every acre we
save is a plus. The US Department of
Agriculture projects that in 40 years we will have almost 400,000 fewer acres
of forest in the US. Did you know that US
forests are decreasing faster than those in Brazil? Check out this link to
learn more:  
http://news.mongabay.com/2010/0427-hance_forestloss.html
·And that's just the beginning of why it matters. A growing body of research shows that our mental,
physical and spiritual health is directly linked to our association with
nature. 

·In a world with
less leisure time, the amount of time we all spend inside in front of a TV
or computer screen has created something that author Richard Louv calls
""Nature Deficit Disorder""—this means that children, families, even
entire communities, have a diminished use of their senses, attention
difficulties and higher rates of physical and emotional illnesses.

What We Need & What You
Get
Our $50,350 goal will allow
us to purchase the first section of the 48 acres of land that is slated for
development; get Anahata off the ground with a legal organizational structure; and begin
our Learning Center programming. Here's the breakdown:
Budget:

Two building lots of the 48-acre parcel (3.5
     acres)*: $35,000
Land appraisal for full 48 acres: $2,700
Non-profit organizational status [501(c)(3)]:
     $5,850
Limited Liability Company (LLC) for profit-based
     arm to support non-profit activity: $1,800

Programming (forest and wildlife workshops,
     interactive presentations, and other knowledge-based nature
     experiences): $5,000  

Total: $50,350

*This
initial purchase will buy us time to raise the money to purchase the rest of
the 48-acre parcel.
What you'll get out of this investment in Anahata:
You'll
be supporting the preservation of a gorgeous piece of land as seen in our video
and photographs here. You'll also be investing in programming that focuses on
workshops and interactive educational experiences that promote interactions with the natural world by focusing on:
· 
Tracking, 
· 
Bird watching, 
· 
Wildlife rescue
workshops; 
· 
Foraging
· 
Botany
· 
Native/invasive
plant knowledge 
· 
Fort building 
· 
Orienteering 
· 
Camping
· 
Enjoying the
power and healing benefits of nature through what we call Nature Bonding
Retreats.
What
happens if we don't reach our goal?
We will use whatever money we get to buy as much land as we can, and/or get our
non-profit status so that we will be eligible for grants from private
foundations and governmental organizations.
Our track record
1.  We have already conserved 230 acres of pristine
Massachusetts woodland (125 of those acres soon to be held in non-developable
status for perpetuity through a state conservation program).
2.  Over the past five years the forests on these lands
have been managed for sustainability and healthy forest growth as well as
wildlife conservation and proliferation by working with certified foresters,
land preservation and wildlife conservation experts.
3.  We have received three USDA conservation grants to
protect the forests and wildlife we steward.
But…we don't want to stop there…
· 
We want to
preserve more forests and wildlife
· 
We want to help
to decrease nature deficit disorder through exciting and fun experiences for
people of all ages and backgrounds that allow them to have positive interactions with the
natural world
· 
We want to
provide public access to a 48-acre nature preserve.

<h2>The elephant with no trunk.</h2>
<p>They say that a picture paints a thousand words, but no words can describe the pain, the anguish and the fear this young elephant went through when its trunk got caught in a poachers wire snare. The pain, the fear and the anguish that still haunts  it today. The wire tightening around its trunk every time it pulled, cutting deeper and deeper into the flesh, until finally severing the trunk in two.</p>
<p>The very trunk which is the lifeline of the elephant, its only tool which it uses for feeding and drinking, and the fact that the elephant survived is in itself a miracle of nature, showing how African wildlife are able to adapt to the most hostile circumstances. What caused this tragedy? Poachers- illegal hunters and fishermen, using inhumane ways to capture animals and fish, often causing untold suffering and pain to their prey and victims.</p>
<p>As with any natural environment, everything hangs in nature’s balance, from the smallest insect, to the largest mammal and the persecution of any one species throws the whole ecosystem into disarray. We have hundreds of similar cases involving numerous species of animals, birds and fish.  </p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Gache Gache Environmental Protection Services (GGEPS) is a voluntary antipoaching unit that bases itself in the Gache Gache conservation area on the shores of Lake Kariba between Zimbabwe and Zambia. GGEPS is funded through donations and from the management of Gache Gache Lodge. However there is an ever increasing cost to keeping this unit going and resources are now stretched to the limit. Costs of around $3500 a month are being incurred, on fuel and maintenance of boats and vehicles, food and allowances for the antipoaching unit, and food for the rescued and rehabilitated animals and orphans of the dead animals.</p>
<p>Since the inception of the EPS in 2010, over 300 hundred poachers have been arrested, thousands of wire snares and traps have been collected and hundreds of meters of nylon fishing nets confiscated. The anti poaching unit often return to base with tonnes of fish, and dead and decaying or near dead animals caught in the traps. </p>
<h3>Funding requirements</h3>
<p>Although we have set a target of $24,000, it will only last 6 months.</p>
<p>Monthly expenses incurred are $1,000 for fuel and maintenance of vehicles boats and equipment, $1,500 for food for the anti-poaching unit and animals, and $1,000 for allowances for the volunteer antipoaching unit. This gives the total of $3500 a month for 6 months to $21,000, of the remaining, $1,000 is to be used to reequip the unit with new uniforms, new communications and surveillance equipment, $1,000 to cover any ancillary costs and $1,000 for the ongoing education programme in the surrounding communiites.</p>
<h3>For your donations,</h3>
<p> For each donation we will personally thank you and mention your name in our newsletters and on our website, you will also receive the regular updates. For Donations of $25 and over you will recieve a certificate of appreciation from GGEPS. For donations over $50 you will recieve a certificate, and an antipoaching team baseball cap.For donations over $100 we will send you an Antipoaching team T-shirt aswell as a cap and certificate. For donations over $250 you will recieve all the other perks already mentioned aswell as an embroidered golf/polo shirt from team GGEPS, and for each $1000 you donate, you will get a free night at Gache Gache lodge.</p>
<p>As it is an ongoing project, every little helps. Even if we don’t reach our goal, the money raised will be put to good use. Up until recently there has been a slight decrease in the number of incidents recorded, but this was due to the rainy season in Zimbabwe, and the wildlife having plenty of food and cover in the thick bush, but now winter is upon us, it is very dry, the bush has thinned, and the animals have to come to the shorefront in order to drink, leaving them vulnerable out in the open.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>More about us</h2>
<p>GGEPS is an Antipoaching unit that runs alongside a commercial operation Chapungu Safaris, trading as Gache Gache lodge. </p>
<p>Gache Gache Lodge is situated on the shores of Lake Kariba, one of the world’s largest manmade lakes on the Zambezi River between Zimbabwe and Zambia in Africa. Gache Gache Lodge is a rustic safari lodge on the Lake. It offers visitors some of the best game viewing and fresh water game fishing in the world. It has its own exclusive 25square kilometre of natural bush, under lease form the local council and community.  It is here that buffalo and elephant roam alongside each other, and hippos wallow and crocodiles bask along the shoreline.</p>
<p>Whilst the lodge runs as a commercial entity, a hotspot for both local and foreign tourists, the management and staff, along with the local communities have realized the need to preserve this unique setting. Through education, the communities have been taught the value of both the wildlife and fish, and are working together with the management and staff to bring the poaching and wanton destruction of the natural ecosystems under control. </p>
<p><strong><em>TAPSON CHIBAYAMAGORA, </em></strong><strong><em>is a Tonga born local (EPS TEAM LEADER) his comments are as follows:-</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>""The area around the Gache Gache Lodge i.e. the south bank of the eastern basin of Lake Kariba has been teeming with illegal poachers and fishermen, who net large amounts of fish and destroy the natural breeding sanctuary for fish in the river system. Illegal catches of 10 tonnes and more a day are no exaggeration. Local fishermen with legal licences in the area were concerned about the fish poaching as it was also impacting their own livelihoods and a group of four community members approached Gache Gache Lodge for assistance to put a stop to this. The Lodge responded positively to the community fishermen and to date have supported them with uniforms, boats and motors, fuel and vehicles to transport them around the area and take poachers to the Kariba police station. Local National Parks, Nyaminyami Rural District Council, police and the surrounding community are all working together, despite their limited resources, to conserve, protect and rehabilitate this beautiful area.""</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Tapson described a typical day of anti-poaching activities. Their day starts at sunrise when they go out into the bush looking for snares and captured animals. He said they can find anything up to 60 snares a day which they dismantle and destroy. Then as the sun sets, they begin to get ready for the night watch on the water. A patrol can be anything from four to seven days out in the bush and on the water.  Tapson says: ‘’Within the first four months, we managed to start to control illegal activities in this area, we are fighting for and protecting our heritage and we will continue to do so. We don’t want our future generations to read about and see a picture of a Tiger Fish in a book… We want them to see a beautiful, live fish in the lake.’’</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since the inception of the EPS in 2010, over 300 hundred poachers have been arrested, thousands of wire snares and traps have been collected and hundreds of meters of nylon fishing nets confiscated. People may argue that the fishermen are trying to earn a living however they stray out of the designated fishing areas, into the protected breeding areas, thus damaging the fragile balance of fish reserves in the lake. The anti poaching unit often return to base with tonnes of fish, and with dead and decaying or near dead animals caught in the traps. </p>
<p>Of course this all comes at a cost. A cost that so far the lodge, and a few donations have been carrying. The units need feeding, protective clothing, new communications systems, and fuel and maintenance costs for vehicles and boats for patrolling. Currently all vehicles and boats are owned and maintained by the lodge.</p>

<h2>Future developments</h2>
<p>Due to its success in the Gache Gache area, GGEPS has been approached by other councils and the National Parks Authority of Zimbabwe, to protect other areas within the region. This comes as a great compliment, in a society where outside interference such as this is often shunned. These areas include the Songo Wilderness area and the Phundundu Wilderness areas, covering some 300 000hectares of prime habitat, along the shores of Lake Kariba and the Zambezi Escarpment. Both areas in recent years have been very badly poached, but fortunately the local authorities have realised what a negative impact this has had, and are actively seeking assistance to bring it under control. Both areas still have a core of wildlife in them, so if protected will breed and repopulate the areas, also once these areas are made safer, wildlife will be attracted in from surrounding high pressure areas. This will come at great cost, as education programs will have to be embarked upon, new anti poaching rangers will have to be employed and trained, deployment logistics considered, vehicles, communications and other equipment will have to be taken care of.</p>
<p>There is also on offer a previous private game reserve, Ruwanzi Ranch, which we want to resuscitate, and create a sanctuary for the orphaned, injured and rehabilitated animals. This ranch is an ideal setting for a sanctuary such as this, it has perfect habitat for most of the game species of Zimbabwe. Unfortunately it has been very run down, and needs a large sum of money to bring it up to standard. Money is required for fencing, re-equipping the antipoaching unit, and for infrastructure maintenance such as roads, and dams to supply water to the wildlife.</p>
<p>If sufficient funds are raised over and above the target, we will then start prioritising funds into these areas.</p>

<h3>About the co-ordinator</h3>
<p>Gavin Havercroft</p>
<p>After a trip to the Gache Gache area with my 10 year old nephew, we were under no illusion of the good work that was been carried out by the management, staff and antipoaching unit of the GGEPS. My nephew embarked on his own fundraising project for the Antipoaching campaign, and raised over $200 from garage sales, raffles and car boot sales. Following his enthusiasm I decided that I should try and do something as well. Having set up my own crowdfunding platforms crowd2IPO and icrowdafrica (both equity based platforms, rather than reward based platforms) I decided to look for another crowdfunding platform with which to raise some funding for the project. Indiegogo seemed like the best option with which to do a project such as this.  Growing up in the bush of Zimbabwe left an appreciation of the wildlife and environment that is hard to describe. I believe that it would be socially irresponsible for me not to try and leave the bush the way I was fortunate enough to grow up in, for our children’s and grandchildren’s sake. </p>

A patrol can be anything from four to seven days out in the bush and on the water.  Tapson says: ‘’Within the first four months, we managed to start to control illegal activities in this area, we are fighting for and protecting our heritage and we will continue to do so. We don’t want our future generations to read about and see a picture of a Tiger Fish in a book… We want them to see a beautiful, live fish in the lake.’’
 
Since the inception of the EPS in 2010, over 300 hundred poachers have been arrested, thousands of wire snares and traps have been collected and hundreds of meters of nylon fishing nets confiscated. People may argue that the fishermen are trying to earn a living however they stray out of the designated fishing areas, into the protected breeding areas, thus damaging the fragile balance of fish reserves in the lake. The anti poaching unit often return to base with tonnes of fish, and with dead and decaying or near dead animals caught in the traps. 
Of course this all comes at a cost. A cost that so far the lodge, and a few donations have been carrying. The units need feeding, protective clothing, new communications systems, and fuel and maintenance costs for vehicles and boats for patrolling. Currently all vehicles and boats are owned and maintained by the lodge.

Future developments
Due to its success in the Gache Gache area, GGEPS has been approached by other councils and the National Parks Authority of Zimbabwe, to protect other areas within the region. This comes as a great compliment, in a society where outside interference such as this is often shunned. These areas include the Songo Wilderness area and the Phundundu Wilderness areas, covering some 300 000hectares of prime habitat, along the shores of Lake Kariba and the Zambezi Escarpment. Both areas in recent years have been very badly poached, but fortunately the local authorities have realised what a negative impact this has had, and are actively seeking assistance to bring it under control. Both areas still have a core of wildlife in them, so if protected will breed and repopulate the areas, also once these areas are made safer, wildlife will be attracted in from surrounding high pressure areas. This will come at great cost, as education programs will have to be embarked upon, new anti poaching rangers will have to be employed and trained, deployment logistics considered, vehicles, communications and other equipment will have to be taken care of.
There is also on offer a previous private game reserve, Ruwanzi Ranch, which we want to resuscitate, and create a sanctuary for the orphaned, injured and rehabilitated animals. This ranch is an ideal setting for a sanctuary such as this, it has perfect habitat for most of the game species of Zimbabwe. Unfortunately it has been very run down, and needs a large sum of money to bring it up to standard. Money is required for fencing, re-equipping the antipoaching unit, and for infrastructure maintenance such as roads, and dams to supply water to the wildlife.
If sufficient funds are raised over and above the target, we will then start prioritising funds into these areas.

About the co-ordinator
Gavin Havercroft
After a trip to the Gache Gache area with my 10 year old nephew, we were under no illusion of the good work that was been carried out by the management, staff and antipoaching unit of the GGEPS. My nephew embarked on his own fundraising project for the Antipoaching campaign, and raised over $200 from garage sales, raffles and car boot sales. Following his enthusiasm I decided that I should try and do something as well. Having set up my own crowdfunding platforms crowd2IPO and icrowdafrica (both equity based platforms, rather than reward based platforms) I decided to look for another crowdfunding platform with which to raise some funding for the project. Indiegogo seemed like the best option with which to do a project such as this.  Growing up in the bush of Zimbabwe left an appreciation of the wildlife and environment that is hard to describe. I believe that it would be socially irresponsible for me not to try and leave the bush the way I was fortunate enough to grow up in, for our children’s and grandchildren’s sake.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>By the end of February we had successfully built a two-storey prototype of an ice stupa which could store roughly 150,000
liters of winter stream water which nobody wants.  We
called it an Ice Stupa because the shape resembled the traditional  stupas of Ladakh and Tibet.</p>

idea that could save many villages in the Himalayas from the water crisis
caused by fast melting glaciers.  As the natural glaciers are becoming smaller and smaller in size there is much less water in early spring and then they release lots during the hotter summers and become even smaller. With these ice stupas the fresh snow and ice in the mountains that melt even in winter and goes waste can be frozen and stored until spring when farmers need the most. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>

not new. I had heard stories of how people in Ladakh and Baltistan would go high up
into the mountains above 14,000 feet and do what they called glacier grafting,
to 'grow' new glaciers. Their methods were not very scientific, but in recent years a senior Ladakhi civil engineer Mr. Norphel worked on freezing
the waste water in winter through diversion canals to make vast fields of ice at high altitudes. His work inspired me
a lot, and he asked me to work on overcoming the limitations that he was facing in his technique.  These artificial glaciers needed regular maintenance of
the canals. Since they were possible only above the altitude of 13,000 </span></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16.3636360168457px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">feet</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> (4,000 m), villagers were not inclined to do the hard work of climbing up and down those heights</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">. Secondly even at these heights these glaciers had to be made
at special spots shaded from the sun by a north facing steep mountain.  These conditions are not easy to find in
most villages.</span></p>
<p>So I started thinking of ways to solve these problems. I questioned the fundamental belief that
these glaciers had to be made so high up, and in the shade. I
observed that for the spring sun and winds to melt the ice, they needed large
surface areas. So if we reduced this area exposed to the sun and
wind, then the ice could be stored in the village itself, thus eliminate the need for villagers to climb the mountains.  That’s when we came up with the idea of forming cones of ice rising <span style=""font-size: 16.3636360168457px; background-color: initial;"">vertically</span><span style=""font-size: 16.3636360168457px; background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">towards the sun with much
smaller surface area exposed to the sun compared to ice fields formed on flat
ground, for a given volume of water. </span></p>
<p>For example one Ice Stupa of 40 m height and 20 m radius would store roughly sixteen million litres of water.  If the same amount of water were frozen as a flat ice field 2 m thick, the area exposed to sun would be roughly five times more. Therefore the sun and the warm spring winds would melt it roughly 5 times faster.<br/></p>
<p>The technology used for making the ice cones is very simple. As explained in the video, it is based on the principle that water always maintains its level, whether in a cup, a lake or inside a pipe. So we are able to make the water at one end of a pipe rise many stories high, simply by dipping its other end higher up-stream.  And in Ladakh water falling out (or sprinkled) from such heights freezes immediately due to the cold air temperature. It gradually takes the shape of a natural cone.</p>

<div><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">In the olden days Ladakhi people used to build stupas near the monasteries by a system of democratic labour contribution called <i>hala</i>. We thought it would be interesting today in the digital age, to build ice stupas using global contribution in the form of a digital <i>hala</i>.  Besides, it only makes sense to invite global contribution to help solve the problems we are facing here in the mountains, since whether we like it or not, we receive more than our fair share of the impact of your other global (warming) contributions  :P</span></div>

stupas will happen around 5th of March.  People of the village and surrounding areas
will come to put prayer flags of different religions on the Stupas. Putting Buddhist
prayer flags on Stupas is a traditional practice in Ladakh and Tibet but in
this case the prayer flags will have
a scientific function too.  To partially
shade the stupas from the strong spring sun and to break the speed of the warm
spring winds… two main factors that melt any glaciers fast in summer.</p>
<p>So it wouldn’t
be a total lie if we say to the villagers that their prayer flags would please
the heavens and the ice stupas would last much longer :P .  This is what we did on the prototype stupa
and it looked beautiful.</p>

<p><b>HOW <b> </b>YOU <b>CAN </b>JOIN THIS ?</b></p>
<p>1. You can contribute however small or big.  $ 10 or $ 10,000, it is the spirit that counts.  It may not be easy to see the possible impact of your contribution at present;  but your $ 10 could pave the way for billions of dollars when this experiment is successful and is picked up by the mainstream development machinery i.e. government and other agencies for all the other villages in Ladakh and beyond.<br/><br/> 2. Apart from contributing with your credit card after you
read this story you can also spread the news among your friends and relatives
and on social media. <br/>If you are not able to make a financial contribution don't worry at all, that's not the only way to help. This is as much an Education-Campaign as it is a Fund-Raising campaign.</p>
<p>3. You can host small events in your
neighbourhood to screen the film and discuss and spread awareness about climate
issues and people's lifestyles and then help them make their contributions if they like. </p>
<p>This would make you an Ice Stupa
Ambassador. If you want to do this you should get in touch with us at <a href=""mailto:icestupa@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">icestupa@gmail.com</a> .</p>
<p>4. You can also use this story to educate your
children or your students about the consequences of their behaviour and
lifestyle on people in the mountains and the seashores.</p>
<p>5. If you have a particular skill related to the project or are the truly adventurous type you can join as a volunteer to work on the
ice stupa making starting November. Don't forget: we will be working in -15 C nights!</p>
<p>6. You can support our cause by cutting down
on a lifestyle that causes climate change. For example you can pledge to use
public transport, bicycle, train or car pool where possible instead a private
car or air travel. </p>
<p>I will be happiest if the amount you donate
to this project comes from cutting down on a not so healthy activity in your life.  Say from that avoidable air travel you were
considering, or by saying 'No' to the 12<sup>th</sup> pair of shoes or the third car
in your family.</p>
<p>Best of all will be if this festive season you
decide not to buy conventional industry-made products as Christmas gifts, and
instead gift your dear ones  a portion of an Ice Stupa in the Himalayas. We'll send you a beautiful card that says so, and expresses your sentiment.  Similarly for the Hindu festival of Diwali you could save your city the noise and pollution of fire crackers,  and brighten the lives of mountain farmers
by supporting the Ice Stupa project.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, it would be great if you could make a one-minute video with your message to the world and if possible, state what unhealthy practice you gave up or forgo this year, to
contribute to this project. You can then post it on social media just after
making your contribution.</p>
<p>Please share such videos only after you
make the contribution and not before (we don’t want you to make a video and
forget the contribution, the reverse would be more acceptable !). And at the end of
the video you can invite (not challenge) three of your closest friends to make
a similar gesture.  We could call this “the
Ice Stupa Invitation”.</p>
<p>In short your video could have three
components:</p>
<p>1. Your short message to the world,</p>
<p>2. What did you cut down to make your
donation?</p>
<p>3. Which three people would you invite to do the
same?<br/><br/>For sharing such videos and your opinions in general you could use our Facebook page: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/icestupa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/icestupa</a><br/>and on Twitter: <a href=""https://twitter.com/icestupa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/icestupa</a></p>
<p>Of course if you are not comfortable with video you could just make a written post on the above social media sites saying the same things.</p>

<p><b>BUDGET</b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/951564/files/20141022113658-Screenshot__4_.png?1414003018"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 620px; height: 607px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<br/><p>Our actual project budget is $ 100,000.  The rest has been added for covering platform fees, bank/credit card charges, rewards, perks and shipment costs for supporters.</p>
<p>Although the project is a collaboration of
our school (SECMOL) and  Phyang monastery, we have requested that the final amount should go into the
bank accounts of the monastery under the personal supervision
of  His Holiness.  Our school will provide and organise all the
expertise, consultation and project management staff/volunteers etc. for fund-raising as well as planning and execution of the project throughout  winter. For this we will be
suitably compensated from the project budget. Part of this amount will be used to run a course in solar energy at the Campus.</p>
<p>The above target amount of $ 119,500 is based on standard
rates of materials, labour etc. in the market. In reality we may have
volunteers donating their labour equipment etc… but we cannot count on such
things at this stage… Therefore we pledge that if any money is saved or left over from this project then
every penny will go towards a dream project of the Phyang monastery and
SECMOL -  setting up an Alternative
Mountain University (on the desert near the monastery) that conducts research
&amp; development and higher educational courses for Himalayan youth in
mountain studies and climate change adaptation strategies, apart from other
themes. We assure you every dollar will be accounted for.</p>

<p>======================================================================</p>
<p>こんにちは、ソナム・ワングチュクです。私はインドの極北、チベット高原にある美しいヒ</p>
<p>マラヤ山脈の砂漠、ラダックの出身です。機械技師としての教育を受けましたが、専ら故郷</p>
<p>の教育改革のために活動しています。このエリアの教育・環境問題に革新的な解決策をもた</p>
<p>らしている有名なSECMOLというオルタナティブ・スクール</p>
<p>(<a href=""http://www.secmol.org)%E3%81%AE%E8%A8%AD%E7%AB%8B%E3%82%82%E3%81%9D%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%80%E7%92%B0%E3%81%A7%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E5%AD%90%E4%BE%9B%E4%BB%A5%E5%A4%96%E3%81%A7%E3%81%AF%E3%80%81%E7%81%AB%E3%80%81%E6%B0%B7%E3%80%81%E5%9C%B0%E7%90%83%E3%80%81"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.secmol.org)の設立もその一環です。子供以外では、火、氷、地球、</a></p>
<p>太陽と戯れることが好きです。つまり、効率的なストーブ、人工氷河、太陽の熱だけで暖め</p>
<p>られている究極の現代的な家、土の家。それらを研究しているのです。私自身のことはこれ</p>
<p>くらいにしますが、私についてさらに知りたい方は私の名前（珍しい名前であることに感謝</p>
<p>！）で検索いただければと思います。</p>
<p>これが私達の学校のすぐ側、典型的なラダックの風景です。そして学校の近影です。</p>
<p>何年もの間、SECMOLスクールキャンパスの生徒と教師達は様々な革新的プロジェクト</p>
<p>のために研究しています。マイナス25度の温度の中でも暖房の要らない土の建物を太陽熱で</p>
<p>暖める方法や、冬のラダックでも大規模農業を可能にする低価格の温室や、最安の水パイプ</p>
<p>の10分の1の価格の地下の土パイプ、ソーラー人力車、バイオガス工場、少量の木材で料理</p>
<p>・暖房出来ておまけにその熱でパンまでも焼けるロケットストーブなどなど。これらは研究</p>
<p>のほんの一部です。</p>
<p>氷卒塔婆、ラダックの人工氷河プロジェクト</p>
<p>2014年1月、私はこの学校の生徒数人と『氷卒塔婆』という興味深いプロジェクトに着手し</p>
<p>ました。自然の氷河が解けて流れ出す前の四月と五月、ラダックの農家は水不足に直面しま</p>
<p>す。それを解決することこそこのプロジェクトの目的です。</p>
<p>二月末までに、二階建ての試作模型を作ることに成功しました。この卒塔婆は冬の間、誰も</p>
<p>使わない川の流れから大体15万リットルの水を貯めることが出来ます。私達これをは『氷卒</p>
<p>塔婆』と呼ぶことにしました。形がチベットとラダックの伝統的な卒塔婆に良く似ているか</p>
<p>伝統的な『土の卒塔婆』</p>
<p>この巨大な氷の卒塔婆は、温暖化によって、氷河がどんどんなくなっている現象によって起</p>
<p>こる水不足からヒマラヤの村々を救うというアイデアが有効かを試すものです。自然の氷河</p>
<p>は年々小さくなっているので、特に早春に溶ける水は少なく、逆に暑い夏になると、多量の</p>
<p>水が溶け出して、さらに氷河が縮小します。この氷の卒塔婆を作ることによって、冬の間も</p>
<p>解けていて、無駄になっている氷や雪を春まで凍らせておくことによって、農家の人たちが</p>
<p>水が一番必要な時期に使うことが出来るようになるのです。</p>
<p>しかし人工的な氷河を作るというこのアイデアは新しいものではありません。ラダックとバ</p>
<p>ルティスターンの人々が1万4千フィート（約４３００ｍ）の高さの山に上り、新しい氷河を</p>
<p>「育ててきた」（彼らが言うところの『氷河移植』）という話は何度も聞いたことがありま</p>
<p>した。その方法は科学的なものでありません。しかし近年ラダックの土木技師ノーフェル氏</p>
<p>が、高地で広大な氷を作るため、分水路を通して余分な水を冬の間に凍らせる活動をしてき</p>
<p>ました。私は彼の活動に多大な刺激を受けました。そして技術の限界を感じていた彼は私の</p>
<p>参加を求めてきたのです。人工氷河は水路の定期的なメンテナンスが必要です。この方法で</p>
<p>は、水路は標高4000メートル以上のところだけが可能であり、村人が山と水路の間を往来す</p>
<p>るのは大変です。更に、氷河は険しい山の中、太陽の光を遮る場所で作られなければいけま</p>
<p>せん。こういった条件をクリアすることはほとんどの村で難しいのです。</p>
<p>私はこれらの問題の解決策を考えるようになりました。私は「氷河は標高の高い日陰で作ら</p>
<p>れるべき」という根本的な考えに疑問を持ちました。そして春の太陽と雪が氷を溶かすため</p>
<p>には広大な表面積が必要なことに気づきました。つまり太陽・風が当たる面積を減らせば、</p>
<p>氷河は村に貯蔵することが可能で、そうなれば村人が山を登る必要はないのです。その時私</p>
<p>は太陽に向かって垂直に氷を作るというアイデアを思いつきました。そうすれば平らな地面</p>
<p>に作る氷のフィールドに比べ、当たる太陽光がかなり削減されます。</p>
<p>例えば、半径20メートル・高さ40メートルの氷の卒塔婆は、一体で大体1600万リットルの水</p>
<p>を貯蓄できます。もし同じ量の水を厚さ2メートルにして平らに凍らせた場合、太陽熱に晒</p>
<p>される面積は卒塔婆の５倍になります。陽光と春風は５倍の速さで氷を溶かしてしまうわけ</p>
<p>氷の円錐を作る方法は非常にシンプルです。ビデオで説明されているように、それは、カッ</p>
<p>プや湖、パイプの中であろうと変わらない水の性質にのっとっています。つまりパイプの片</p>
<p>方側の水を数階の高さに吹き上げ、もう片方側をただ上流に垂らせばよいのです。そしてラ</p>
<p>ダックでは、空気中の温度が低いため、流れた水（または、まかれた水）はあっという間に</p>
<p>凍ってしまうのです。それが繰り返されることによって徐々に自然の円錐が形作られていく</p>
<p>暑さに負けない氷のプリン！</p>
<p>6メートルの試作模型を作ったことでこの仮説は証明されました。平らな地面の氷が三月半</p>
<p>ばまでに溶けてしまう中、この卒塔婆は5月18日、木々の葉が緑になり温度が30度近くにな</p>
<p>る初夏まで残ったのです。実験成功が決定した5月1日には卒塔婆はまだ3メートル残ってい</p>
<p>3月半ばまでに、地面上の平らな氷は解けてしまいましたが、卒塔婆は残っていました。</p>
<p>五月まで、緑と氷とが並ぶという珍しい光景を見ることが出来ました。</p>
<p>試作模型は最も温暖な条件の中で作成されました。つまりここで成功したということは、他</p>
<p>の場所でも成功するということです。レー峡谷で最も標高の低い場所、標高3170メートルの</p>
<p>インダス川沿いに作られ、お祈りの旗（タルチョー）以外は、太陽光にあたっていたのです</p>
<p>から。（タルチョーについては後述します）</p>
<p>僧侶の高僧。技師で2014年5月1日の人工氷河の製作者です。</p>
<p>ディグン　キャブゴンチェツァン高僧（リンポチェイ）はこの結果に喜び、我がスクールと</p>
<p>卒塔婆を訪れて祝ってくれました。そして、ピャン村の砂漠の頂上に試作でなく、完全な氷</p>
<p>卒塔婆を立てて欲しいとSECMOLに要請したのです。聖下はチベット仏教において最も</p>
<p>位の高い生き仏であり、ヒマラヤでの緑化活動 </p>

<p>Green Go Organic』活動の下、ピャン砂漠を緑化したいと願ったのです。</p>
<p>有名なピャン寺院と広大な砂漠。</p>
<p>何故クラウドファンディングか？</p>
<p>古代、ラダックの人々は僧院の側に卒塔婆を建てていました。その行為は市民による民主的</p>
<p>な労働貢献で、ハラと呼ばれていました。このデジタル全盛期の時代に、地球の力でもって</p>
<p>氷の卒塔婆を作ることは「デジタルなハラ」と言うことも出来ます。この考えは面白いと思</p>
<p>いませんか？　その上、この山脈で直面している問題を解決するために地球に貢献してもら</p>
<p>うことは意味のあることです。なぜなら好むと好まざるに関係なく、私たちは地球温暖化の</p>
<p>影響を自分たちのシェア以上に受けているからです。</p>
<p>そしてこの冬、世界の人々はピャン寺院の側に氷卒塔婆を建てるために力を合わせます！そ</p>
<p>して砂漠を緑に変え村人と僧侶たちを助けるのです。</p>
<p>9月にはプロジェクトについて、高僧（リンポチェイ）とピャンの村人たちとで話し合う場</p>
<p>が設けられました。村からは仏教徒だけでなくイスラム教徒の人々も参加しました。</p>
<p>僧侶と村のリーダーたちは僧院に集合し、砂漠緑化計画を支持する世界の人々に感謝しまし</p>
<p>た。プロジェクトが完了すれば、6百万ｍ2もの砂漠を緑に変えるのに充分な水が生まれるこ</p>
<p>とになります。彼らはまたピャン砂漠を、自然資源で建てた住宅と太陽光のみでエネルギー</p>
<p>と熱をまかなう持続可能なエコシティへと変える可能性についても意見を交わしました。</p>
<p>氷卒塔婆キャンペーン、本格始動。</p>
<p>10月13日、ジャム・カシミール州の知事でもある、 エヌ・エヌ・ ヴォホラ閣下は気候変動</p>
<p>適応のための国際会議にて、『氷卒塔婆・人工氷河プロジェクト』を立ち上げました。そこ</p>
<p>で私たちのフィルム『僧侶、技師と人工氷河』を使用したのです。</p>
<p>ラダックの僧侶、技師と人工氷河。プロジェクト立ち上げの後。</p>
<p>2014年、10月半ば～11月半ば。</p>
<p>パイプ取り付け完了。</p>
<p>12月はじめ～2015年2月末</p>
<p>卒塔婆の形成が開始。</p>
<p>1日頃、卒塔婆の祝い・奉納を始める。村人、近隣住民が卒塔婆に様々なタルチョーをかけ</p>
<p>るために集まる。ラダック・チベットでは仏教の（祈りの旗）タルチョーを卒塔婆にかける</p>
<p>のが伝統的なならわしだが、この場合タルチョーは科学的な意味を持つ。氷河を溶かす二大</p>
<p>要素、強い春の日差しと春の風から卒塔婆を守るのだ。</p>
<p>そのため、祈りのタルチョーによって天界が卒塔婆の溶解を遅らせると私たちが村人に言っ</p>
<p>たことは嘘ではありません！　試作の卒塔婆はそういうふうに作り、とても美しく完成しま</p>

</div></div>","Hi, I am Sonam Wangchuk from Ladakh, a beautiful trans-Himalayan mountain desert on the Tibetan plateau, in the extreme north of India. I am a mechanical
engineer by training, but have mostly worked in education reforms in my region. This included setting up the SECMOL Alternative School (www.secmol.org) well known for its
innovative solutions to the region's educational and environmental problems.  Apart from children, I like to play with fire, ice, earth and sun, meaning I have been studying and doing experiments with efficient stoves, artificial glaciers and ultra-modern mud houses that are heated solely by the sun.  I won’t write more about myself, you can Google my
name (an unusual name helps). Typical landscape of Ladakh near our school and a closer-up view of the school.Over the years, students and teachers at the SECMOL School Campus have been working on various innovative projects ranging from solar heated mud buildings that need no heating even in -25C,
low cost greenhouses that enable large scale farming even in Ladakhi winters, underground mud pipes that are one tenth the cost of the cheapest water pipes, solar rickshaws, solar heated bio-gas plant and rocket stoves that cook and heat with a fraction of the wood needed by other stoves and even bake bread with the exhaust heat... just to name a few.

THE ICE STUPA ARTIFICIAL GLACIER PROJECT


In January 2014 at this school some of our students worked with me on
an interesting project that we called the Ice Stupa.  Our aim was to find a solution to the water crisis facing Ladakhi farmers in the critical planting months of April and May before the natural glacial melt waters start flowing.
By the end of February we had successfully built a two-storey prototype of an ice stupa which could store roughly 150,000
liters of winter stream water which nobody wants.  We
called it an Ice Stupa because the shape resembled the traditional  stupas of Ladakh and Tibet.
 
A traditional mud stupa.

This large stupa of ice was meant to test an
idea that could save many villages in the Himalayas from the water crisis
caused by fast melting glaciers.  As the natural glaciers are becoming smaller and smaller in size there is much less water in early spring and then they release lots during the hotter summers and become even smaller. With these ice stupas the fresh snow and ice in the mountains that melt even in winter and goes waste can be frozen and stored until spring when farmers need the most. 
However the idea of making artificial glaciers is
not new. I had heard stories of how people in Ladakh and Baltistan would go high up
into the mountains above 14,000 feet and do what they called glacier grafting,
to 'grow' new glaciers. Their methods were not very scientific, but in recent years a senior Ladakhi civil engineer Mr. Norphel worked on freezing
the waste water in winter through diversion canals to make vast fields of ice at high altitudes. His work inspired me
a lot, and he asked me to work on overcoming the limitations that he was facing in his technique.  These artificial glaciers needed regular maintenance of
the canals. Since they were possible only above the altitude of 13,000 feet (4,000 m), villagers were not inclined to do the hard work of climbing up and down those heights. Secondly even at these heights these glaciers had to be made
at special spots shaded from the sun by a north facing steep mountain.  These conditions are not easy to find in
most villages.
So I started thinking of ways to solve these problems. I questioned the fundamental belief that
these glaciers had to be made so high up, and in the shade. I
observed that for the spring sun and winds to melt the ice, they needed large
surface areas. So if we reduced this area exposed to the sun and
wind, then the ice could be stored in the village itself, thus eliminate the need for villagers to climb the mountains.  That’s when we came up with the idea of forming cones of ice rising vertically towards the sun with much
smaller surface area exposed to the sun compared to ice fields formed on flat
ground, for a given volume of water. 
For example one Ice Stupa of 40 m height and 20 m radius would store roughly sixteen million litres of water.  If the same amount of water were frozen as a flat ice field 2 m thick, the area exposed to sun would be roughly five times more. Therefore the sun and the warm spring winds would melt it roughly 5 times faster.
The technology used for making the ice cones is very simple. As explained in the video, it is based on the principle that water always maintains its level, whether in a cup, a lake or inside a pipe. So we are able to make the water at one end of a pipe rise many stories high, simply by dipping its other end higher up-stream.  And in Ladakh water falling out (or sprinkled) from such heights freezes immediately due to the cold air temperature. It gradually takes the shape of a natural cone.
PROOF OF THE (ICE) PUDDING IS IN THE HEATING!
It was to prove this hypothesis that we
built our 6m (20 feet) high prototype.  And sure
enough, while all the ice on the flat ground melted by mid-March, the Stupa lasted
till 18th May i.e. early summer, when trees were all green and temperatures
had started approaching +30 C.  Our
deadline to call this experiment a success was 1st of May but on that date it still stood 3m tall. 
By mid- March all the flat ice on ground had melted, but not our Stupa.


By May it was an unusual sight of ice and greenery at the same time.
The prototype was built in the warmest possible conditions, so that if it succeeds here then it can succeed
anywhere.  It was built at the lowest
possible altitude in the whole Leh valley, right on the bank of Indus river at
10,400 feet (3,170 m), and exposed to sun (except for the
prayer flags, mentioned later).


The Monk (HH the Rinpochey), The Engineer and The Artificial Glacier on 1st of May 2014.
Pleased by this outcome, His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpochey who visited and blessed our School and the Ice Stupa on 1st of May,  wanted SECMOL to build a full scale
version of the Ice Stupa artificial glacier at the top of the vast deserts
of Phyang village. His Holiness is one of the highest incarnate Lamas in Tibetan Buddhism, and is also known for his green activism in the Himalayas (http://www.drikung.org) .  HH wanted to green the Phyang desert under the Go Green Go Organic movement. 




The famous Phyang Monastery and the vast deserts below:


WHY CROWD FUNDING?
In the olden days Ladakhi people used to build stupas near the monasteries by a system of democratic labour contribution called hala. We thought it would be interesting today in the digital age, to build ice stupas using global contribution in the form of a digital hala.  Besides, it only makes sense to invite global contribution to help solve the problems we are facing here in the mountains, since whether we like it or not, we receive more than our fair share of the impact of your other global (warming) contributions  :P
So this winter people of the world get together to build a field of ice stupas near the Phyang monastery to help the villagers and the monks in greening the desert. 

In September there was a meeting of HH the Rinpochey and villagers of Phyang to discuss the project. This included Buddhists as well as Muslims from the village.


Monks and village leaders of Phyang gathered at the monastery wave and thank the people of the world for their support in greening the deserts.  Once this project is complete there should be enough water to green the entire desert of roughly 1,500 acres. They also discussed the possibilities of turning the Phyang desert into a sustainable eco-city where all the houses would be built of earth and powered and heated solely by the sun.
THE FORMAL LAUNCH OF THE ICE STUPA CAMPAIGN


Then on 13th of October His Excellency Sh. NN Vohra, the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir State, launched the Ice Stupa Artificial Glacier Project at an international conference on climate change and adaptation. He did so by clicking open our short film - The Monk, The Engineer and The Artificial Glacier.

The Monk, The Engineer and the Governor of the state... just after the launch.
SCHEDULE:
Mid-October to mid-November 2014Work on ground preparation starts,
End of NovemberPipe laying will be completed .
End of NovemberFirst ice experiments will start.
Early December till end of February 2015Main work of raising the stupas will happen.
Early March 2015A festival to celebrate and consecrate the
stupas will happen around 5th of March.  People of the village and surrounding areas
will come to put prayer flags of different religions on the Stupas. Putting Buddhist
prayer flags on Stupas is a traditional practice in Ladakh and Tibet but in
this case the prayer flags will have
a scientific function too.  To partially
shade the stupas from the strong spring sun and to break the speed of the warm
spring winds… two main factors that melt any glaciers fast in summer.
So it wouldn’t
be a total lie if we say to the villagers that their prayer flags would please
the heavens and the ice stupas would last much longer :P .  This is what we did on the prototype stupa
and it looked beautiful.

THE TEAM


To execute this project we have an amazing
team.
Technical team: Apart from myself we have Dr. Tsewang
Thinlas. Specialist in Hydrology, with a Masters degree from IIT Mumbai and PhD from
IIT Delhi.  He will be assisted by
Stanzin Shara from SECMOL School and many volunteers from India and
abroad.
Execution team: Lama Rigzin Dorjai.  Venerable Rigzin is the manager of Pheyang
monastery and has 15 years of experience in managing constructions at the
monastery.  Apart from this he is a monk
who has completed his Lo sum Chos Sum
meditative retreat of three years, three months and three days in isolation.  Ven.
Rigzin will be assisted by other monks in the monastery.
Film and documentation team:
Stanzin Dorjai Gya:  A former student of SECMOL School.
His is an interesting story of a shepherd-turned-film-maker.  His films have won many international awards
in India and Europe.  He will be assisted
by Tsewang Paldan and Stanzin Detsal and Lars Lidstrom.
Logistics and supplies:
P Tsering: 
A self-made technical geek, he lives and works in Delhi and has great
knowledge of every lane and back alley of the city’s techno-markets to get any
products and materials needed for our project. He will be assisted in Jammu by
Stanzin Namgyal, a PhD scholar at Jammu University and former student of SECMOL
school.  He and his team will look after
the supply of materials from Jammu
city.

HOW  YOU CAN JOIN THIS ?
1. You can contribute however small or big.  $ 10 or $ 10,000, it is the spirit that counts.  It may not be easy to see the possible impact of your contribution at present;  but your $ 10 could pave the way for billions of dollars when this experiment is successful and is picked up by the mainstream development machinery i.e. government and other agencies for all the other villages in Ladakh and beyond. 2. Apart from contributing with your credit card after you
read this story you can also spread the news among your friends and relatives
and on social media. If you are not able to make a financial contribution don't worry at all, that's not the only way to help. This is as much an Education-Campaign as it is a Fund-Raising campaign.
3. You can host small events in your
neighbourhood to screen the film and discuss and spread awareness about climate
issues and people's lifestyles and then help them make their contributions if they like. 
This would make you an Ice Stupa
Ambassador. If you want to do this you should get in touch with us at icestupa@gmail.com .
4. You can also use this story to educate your
children or your students about the consequences of their behaviour and
lifestyle on people in the mountains and the seashores.
5. If you have a particular skill related to the project or are the truly adventurous type you can join as a volunteer to work on the
ice stupa making starting November. Don't forget: we will be working in -15 C nights!
6. You can support our cause by cutting down
on a lifestyle that causes climate change. For example you can pledge to use
public transport, bicycle, train or car pool where possible instead a private
car or air travel. 
I will be happiest if the amount you donate
to this project comes from cutting down on a not so healthy activity in your life.  Say from that avoidable air travel you were
considering, or by saying 'No' to the 12th pair of shoes or the third car
in your family.
Best of all will be if this festive season you
decide not to buy conventional industry-made products as Christmas gifts, and
instead gift your dear ones  a portion of an Ice Stupa in the Himalayas. We'll send you a beautiful card that says so, and expresses your sentiment.  Similarly for the Hindu festival of Diwali you could save your city the noise and pollution of fire crackers,  and brighten the lives of mountain farmers
by supporting the Ice Stupa project.
Whatever you do, it would be great if you could make a one-minute video with your message to the world and if possible, state what unhealthy practice you gave up or forgo this year, to
contribute to this project. You can then post it on social media just after
making your contribution.
Please share such videos only after you
make the contribution and not before (we don’t want you to make a video and
forget the contribution, the reverse would be more acceptable !). And at the end of
the video you can invite (not challenge) three of your closest friends to make
a similar gesture.  We could call this “the
Ice Stupa Invitation”.
In short your video could have three
components:
1. Your short message to the world,
2. What did you cut down to make your
donation?
3. Which three people would you invite to do the
same?For sharing such videos and your opinions in general you could use our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/icestupaand on Twitter: https://twitter.com/icestupa
Of course if you are not comfortable with video you could just make a written post on the above social media sites saying the same things.

BUDGET
Our actual project budget is $ 100,000.  The rest has been added for covering platform fees, bank/credit card charges, rewards, perks and shipment costs for supporters.
Although the project is a collaboration of
our school (SECMOL) and  Phyang monastery, we have requested that the final amount should go into the
bank accounts of the monastery under the personal supervision
of  His Holiness.  Our school will provide and organise all the
expertise, consultation and project management staff/volunteers etc. for fund-raising as well as planning and execution of the project throughout  winter. For this we will be
suitably compensated from the project budget. Part of this amount will be used to run a course in solar energy at the Campus.
The above target amount of $ 119,500 is based on standard
rates of materials, labour etc. in the market. In reality we may have
volunteers donating their labour equipment etc… but we cannot count on such
things at this stage… Therefore we pledge that if any money is saved or left over from this project then
every penny will go towards a dream project of the Phyang monastery and
SECMOL -  setting up an Alternative
Mountain University (on the desert near the monastery) that conducts research
& development and higher educational courses for Himalayan youth in
mountain studies and climate change adaptation strategies, apart from other
themes. We assure you every dollar will be accounted for.
Same holds true in case people of the world
decide to surprise us pleasantly by contributing 10 times more than the target
amount ;) . Not an unfair expectation , if you consider that we receive perhaps 100 times
more impact than our contribution to the climate change scenario!  In any case we will remain prudent and use any extra funds for research and action on climate change through the proposed Alternative University.
So don’t please hesitate to surprise us
pleasantly and if possible please make and post a one-minute video or post with your message to the world.  I mean the...   ICE STUPA INVITATION!
Many thanks for your time and amazing patience.

例えば、半径20メートル・高さ40メートルの氷の卒塔婆は、一体で大体1600万リットルの水
を貯蓄できます。もし同じ量の水を厚さ2メートルにして平らに凍らせた場合、太陽熱に晒
される面積は卒塔婆の５倍になります。陽光と春風は５倍の速さで氷を溶かしてしまうわけ
氷の円錐を作る方法は非常にシンプルです。ビデオで説明されているように、それは、カッ

方側の水を数階の高さに吹き上げ、もう片方側をただ上流に垂らせばよいのです。そしてラ
ダックでは、空気中の温度が低いため、流れた水（または、まかれた水）はあっという間に
凍ってしまうのです。それが繰り返されることによって徐々に自然の円錐が形作られていく
暑さに負けない氷のプリン！
6メートルの試作模型を作ったことでこの仮説は証明されました。平らな地面の氷が三月半

3月半ばまでに、地面上の平らな氷は解けてしまいましたが、卒塔婆は残っていました。
五月まで、緑と氷とが並ぶという珍しい光景を見ることが出来ました。
試作模型は最も温暖な条件の中で作成されました。つまりここで成功したということは、他

何故クラウドファンディングか？
古代、ラダックの人々は僧院の側に卒塔婆を建てていました。その行為は市民による民主的
な労働貢献で、ハラと呼ばれていました。このデジタル全盛期の時代に、地球の力でもって
氷の卒塔婆を作ることは「デジタルなハラ」と言うことも出来ます。この考えは面白いと思

9月にはプロジェクトについて、高僧（リンポチェイ）とピャンの村人たちとで話し合う場

僧侶と村のリーダーたちは僧院に集合し、砂漠緑化計画を支持する世界の人々に感謝しまし

氷卒塔婆キャンペーン、本格始動。
10月13日、ジャム・カシミール州の知事でもある、 エヌ・エヌ・ ヴォホラ閣下は気候変動
適応のための国際会議にて、『氷卒塔婆・人工氷河プロジェクト』を立ち上げました。そこ
