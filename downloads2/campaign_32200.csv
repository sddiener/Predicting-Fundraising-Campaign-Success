<h3>Our Story<br/>
</h3>
<p>Imuhira International is a growing Non profit organization founded by Justin Semahoro Kimenyerwa, Jules Gikundiro and Dan Rugomba. These three are individuals from the Banyamulenge community, a marginalized group of people from the Eastern part of Congo. We are counting it as Grace that we are not victims of the 13 year war that has struck our homeland. Today we celebrate the fact that we are survivors who have received a second chance to life. With the ongoing unrest and instability in our country Congo most of our Banyamulenge people are dispersed out in the diaspora and neighboring countries. Safety and peace is the best gift offered in the refuge countries where they have ended up. </p>
<p>There is also one remaining concern, one which threatens the future of our community's identity. Our culture is quickly fading away. if something is not done, if the issue is not addressed with urgency, the Banyamulenge may end up loosing their identity. That's why we have set our cause on stage to campaigning for the preservation of our dying culture.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A sustainable programme of promoting awareness of our beautiful culture. This will hopefully stir up the desire in our children, separated from their home in Africa, to know their history and encourage them at one point to participate in the construction of the countries future. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It will remind the Banyamulenge people of their roots, including their identity, homeland history,</p>
<p><br/>It will be a most unique opportunity for the international community to have a 1st time opportunity <br/></p>
<p>to view on screen the cultural heritage of the Banyamulenge people which has been unknown for centuries.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
</div><div>We have set a time frame to travel to four different states within the US by the end of June 2011 to educate the younger generation on the importance of practising and identifying with the Banyamulenge culture.  We plan to use song, dance, video, and personal testimonials to tell the story of the Banyamulenge and help preserve their culture.The majority of the funds will be used for travel and accommodation.<br/><br/>In addition, we are hoping to procure a prosumer video camera that will be sent to five different countries in Africa: Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and Kenya<br/><br/>This camera will be used to document, celebrate, preserve the culture, and bring unity to Banyamulenge people separated due to war in their home land. The footage will highlight varied aspects of their culture and will include:<h4>How the Banyamulenge lived before war broke out in their villages</h4>
<ul>
<li>What life looks like for a particular family</li>

<p>The Share Your Voice Foundation's mission is simple.  We strongly believe in the transformative power of the Arts to change lives. We're dedicated to helping young people (primarily disadvantaged and at-risk teens in rural areas ages 13-17) through powerful collaborative experiences such as the Empowerment through Performance (ETP) Workshop program. </p>
<p>Thank you for watching our video (feel free to check out more media in the gallery page of this campaign). The inaugural workshop was held in 2007 and it's been a remarkable journey thus far. We're so proud to still be going strong - changing the lives of a special group of young people each year, one summer at a time. </p>
<p>SYVF serves these teens regardless of race, religion, creed, sex or socio-economic status.  We are committed to making a difference through the tremendous power of the Arts by helping them find and share their voice to promote positive difference.</p>
<p>We ask for your support in making this vision come true in 2012.  It will not happen without your contribution.</p>
<p>The workshop is being held July 16-20 with the final performance night for the community, 'Night at the Landing' being held at beautiful Stillwater Landing, 15 miles from Whitefish in Northwest Montana on Saturday, July 21.</p>
<p>Funds raised on IndieGoGo ensure we will be able run the 2012 workshop and also contribute to recording songs the participants write with a singer-songwriter during the workshop. </p>
<p>SYVF is a qualified 501(c)3 nonprofit association so all donations are tax-deductible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>We're very proud and excited that this will be our 6th year of providing the workshop to young people. This is due to the commitment and generosity of individuals, local organizations, returning graduates, talented guest educators, assistants and volunteers in Montana.</p>
<p>SYVF has already helped over 100 young participants develop higher self-esteem, contribute to their community and become the best they can be. They have graduated from high school, gone on to be awarded college scholarships to Princeton, degrees at MSU, joined and performed in other community theatre groups, and generally succeed living their lives with a greater sense of happiness and solid self-concept. Many choose to return the following year as volunteers to champion the next group of participants.</p>
<p>Through the unique mesh of the creative fields of writing, performance, music and film, participants from SYVF's summer outreach program are encouraged to unleash their creativity in a safe environment while improving self-esteem and developing strong, effective communication skills. They are guided to discover their own innate talents, cultivate a sense of pride and appreciate the importance of collaborating with others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>To run the workshop a lot of careful preparation, team effort, commitment, skilled guest educators, dedicated volunteers and local support is required. It is made possible entirely through community and individual philanthropy. </p>
<p>Your generous contribution to this IndieGogo campaign will enable us to ensure that each participant is given a full scholarship to attend the program and enjoy the benefits of a safe venue, access to talented guest educators, adequate supplies, qualified care and meals during the workshop plus help make the experience of recording a music track in a professional recording studio a reality. Watch the clip from a previous year for the beautiful song, <strong><a href=""http://vimeo.com/35342288"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Love Is The Bridge To Peace</a>.</strong></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>“[sic] Seems to really connect with kids. Has been practicing martial arts for several years and was teaching karate to ""at risk"" kids out of his garage until the classes became too large for his limited space. Not saying he is against money but believe his true aim is to mentor kids into becoming responsible adults. Has a great relationship with hands-on parents and prefers family participation where possible.”  --Michael Stokes, Sunnyvale CA<br/><br/>Collette Martial Arts (CMA) is a community outreach program that focuses on building a strong foundation of the core principles in our members.  We use martial arts to strengthen the individual by instilling a sense of Respect, Self-Confidence, Courage, Self-Control, Integrity, Discipline, and Humility.<br/><br/>By participating in our classes, students learn to work both individually, and as a team.  Our students are able to take these skills into other aspects of their lives, and apply them to work, school, and relationships.<br/><br/>CMA is structured as a legal, for-profit business entity; however, it is run as you would a non-profit organization.  This allows us more flexibility to take support from any place we find it, and to make decisions based on what is best for the student base, rather than what is best for the bottom line.  To date, this project was funded entirely from our own pockets; we just really believe that this is something that is needed in our community.  By functioning this way, we are able to provide our students with a commercial setting and allowing our students to keep their dignity, rather than feeling as though they were being given a hand-out.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This project is to allow us to continue to go and grow for the next 12 months, and to become completely self-sustaining.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>Funding from crowdsourcing will help us bring CMA to hundreds of 
students in the San Francisco Bay Area.  It will also help us to provide
 uniforms, and require gear to our students, and allow them to 
participate in the fantastic Martial Arts Seminars and Tournaments in 
the Bay Area.<br/><br/>
Our staff and supporting parents are genuinely troubled by the recent 
global wave of horrific bullying incidents resulting in expulsions from 
school, physical and verbal abuse, and in some cases, suicide.<br/><br/>
These incidents are prime examples of what our programs are designed to 
prevent.  The idea is to help bring out the positive in each student; by
 not only bringing kids in off the street to do something more 
productive physically, but also mentoring them on how to they can become
 a positive influence on future generations.  We are focused on building
 a better future, one kid at a time.</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To keep this project going and growing, we need a total of 15,000.00.  What we are asking for is 8,000.00, and the rest is funded by family and friends.  To date, my wife and I have put in over 10,000.00 to get the project launched. We are working very hard to not just keep the project going, but to spread the word about the project.  In the end, our goal is not to be known as Just Another Karate School, but to be known as the program that turned out some of the bay areas finest, most upstanding, and unique individuals.  Help us to get the program off the ground.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please - please - spread the word about our project!  The more people that know about it, the more at-risk and underprivileged people we can help.  <br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a middle school music teacher at Norwood School in Bethesda, MD with an incredible passion for African music.  My life was forever changed by a choir tour I took to South Africa in 2009.  </p>
I will travel to Kibera, Kenya this summer for four weeks.  The first two weeks I will be chaperoning sixteen high school students who will be volunteering at the <a href=""http://redrosechildren.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Red Rose School</a>, a subsidiary organization of the <a href=""http://childrenofkibera.org/about.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Children of Kibera Foundation</a>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While I have recieved a small grant through Norwood School to make this journey, I still need some additional funds to support the fourth week of my trip-- when I will take classes in Kenyan drumming and folk song and lead professional development with local teachers in Kibera.</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Important Note: In contributing to this campaign, you are making a donation to me and not a tax-deductible donation to the Children of Kibera Foundation.  </strong>The total cost of my trip is $7,500.  After fundring from the Children of Kibera Foundation and Norwood School, I will be responsible for ~$2,000 myself.  This will cover:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Food and housing in Nairobi for the fourth week of the trip.</li>
<li>Coursework at <a href=""http://www.bomasofkenya.co.ke/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bomas of Kenya</a>, where I will do my training.</li>
<li>Transportation within Nairobi.</li>
<li>The purchase of instruments to bring back to the U.S (including instruments for use at Norwood School).</li>
</ul>
<p>Any extra funds raised will be donated to the Red Rose School. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>Kibera is aproximately the size of Central Park and has somewhere between 200,000 and one million residents.  The police do not patrol Kibera.  Children in the slum grow up incredibly poor. Here is a snippet from the Wikipedia article on Kibera: ""Kibera is heavily polluted by human refuse, garbage, soot, dust, and other wastes. The slum is contaminated with human and animal feces, due to the open <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Sewage"">sewage</a> system and the frequent use of ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_toilet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Flying toilet"">flying toilets</a>"". The lack of sanitation combined with poor nutrition among residents accounts for many illnesses and diseases."" </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Children in Kibera deserve a good education, including training in music and the arts. I have the opportunity to start the first-ever Red Rose Choir.  I will bring American folk music (including music of the Civil Rights Era) to Red Rose and have the students teach me Kenyan folk music.  If I can bring beauty into the lives of even a few of these students, my trip will be a success.  No doubt I will learn far more from the students than they will learn from me.</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<li>reflects the true diversity of Western North Carolina</li>
<li>draws on Cherokee history</li>
<li>holds the inspiration of Black Mountain College</li>
<li>activates both the ancient power of language and the modern tools of tech</li>
<li>draws a multicultural audience by featuring a multicultural line up of poets</li>

<li>poets from the world</li>
<li>classes and workshops</li>

<li>more events</li>
<li>better pay for poets!</li>
<li>make Wordfest sustainabie </li>
<li>expand into more genres, more conversations!</li>
</ul>
<p>I have since childhood found poetry to be a unifying field. It connects things. This is why I believe Western North Carolina needs a strong poetry festival. We need non-divisive spaces. </p>
<p>I grew up in Canada, England, and in the United States. I've traveled and lived in Australia and China.</p>
<p>Global connection is vital to this festival and to me.</p>
<p>I'm seeking to raise money to offset costs of producing this festival. It is free to everything, but it is not free to produce.</p>
<p>Your donation promotes cultural understanding and community.</p>
<p>Your donation pays for hotel, meals, airfare, and poets' stipends.</p>
<p>Your donation pays for promotion so we can reach deeply into communities.</p>
<p>All Wordfest readings are made available on the website for free access in schools and by anyone who needs to hear a human voice.</p>
<p>Your donation helps me dream up more ways Wordfest can grow.</p>

<p>My name is <strong>Wanja Ngure</strong>. I am a <strong>Kenyan human rights activist</strong> and VSO volunteer currently working with an NGO in Malawi called Center for the Development of People (CEDEP). I have lived in Malawi for over three years, and worked tirelessly as an advocate for the rights of sex workers, vulnerable children, and LGBTQI individuals. My work at CEDEP has comprised grant writing, overseeing monitoring and evaluation of ongoing projects, advocacy, and implementing trainings and workshops. In this capacity, I have grown especially passionate about working with sexual minority populations who often face severe discrimination and violence in many African countries. At CEDEP, <strong>I have been a key catalyst in expanding programming for LGBTQI individuals living in Malawi</strong>. For example, I founded a support group for lesbian and trans* identified individuals in Lilongwe, providing them with a safe space for sharing challenges, learning safe sexual practices, and coming to terms with their sexual identities. I am proud to be part of the team that has pioneered the fight for the rights of sexual minorities in Malawi.</p>

My name is Wanja Ngure. I am a Kenyan human rights activist and VSO volunteer currently working with an NGO in Malawi called Center for the Development of People (CEDEP). I have lived in Malawi for over three years, and worked tirelessly as an advocate for the rights of sex workers, vulnerable children, and LGBTQI individuals. My work at CEDEP has comprised grant writing, overseeing monitoring and evaluation of ongoing projects, advocacy, and implementing trainings and workshops. In this capacity, I have grown especially passionate about working with sexual minority populations who often face severe discrimination and violence in many African countries. At CEDEP, I have been a key catalyst in expanding programming for LGBTQI individuals living in Malawi. For example, I founded a support group for lesbian and trans* identified individuals in Lilongwe, providing them with a safe space for sharing challenges, learning safe sexual practices, and coming to terms with their sexual identities. I am proud to be part of the team that has pioneered the fight for the rights of sexual minorities in Malawi.
It is now time for the next phase of my career as a lifelong activist. In September 2013, I will commence a year-long course of study at Kingston University outside London. This Masters of Human Rights program will provide me with the technical and epistemological tools needed to continue my advocacy and programming work.

After completing my course of study at Kingston, I plan to return to sub-Saharan Africa to continue my advocacy work focusing on sexual minority populations living in homophobic contexts.

<p>Some of us hunt with rifles and shotguns to put food on our tables and live off our California land. </p>

<li>Protective Husband's are feeling at ease while at work knowing their wife is trained with their gun and she is capable of protecting herself.</li>
<li>Families are coming together and embracing their right to bear arms.

We can lock up our guns in our homes but you still need a back up plan with children these days. They need to be taught they are not toys. </li>
<li>Elderly people are able to have more of a fight back against the increasing number of criminals taking advantage of them. Their decreasing physical strength makes them common targets and a gun is giving them their strength back.</li>
<li>Adolescent hunters are able to learn to live off our land and support California Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife by promoting good hunting practices and following regulations.

<p>Many of our

secondary school in the village. They didn’t want our older brothers and sisters
to have to walk 2 hours to get to the nearest secondary school.  That
distance, on top of a lot of other difficulties, discouraged so many of them
from continuing school. The drop out rate in our villages was very high. We
wanted a school in our village so kids didn't drop out.</p>
<p>With a big
effort by the parents, the school was established in 2010. They built 2
makeshift classrooms to have class. 80 of my brothers and sisters and I enrolled.
We didn’t have to walk far and we liked going to school.</p>
<p>Every year, more
of our brothers and sisters enrolled. This was very good, but it created

the foundation, part of the walls and the roof. The more funds we receive,
however, the more we can realize the construction plan.
If we don’t
reach $20,000, the funds will still be used to start constructing the school
building. We hope to get enough funds to at least build the foundation and
get a roof over it, so the students can have class inside when the rainy season
starts in April.

Dassa-Zoumé. According to Anicet: “My goal is to constantly think about how we
can exploit our local materials to construct safe, economical, aesthetically
pleasing buildings. I want to make this happen with other entrepreneurs and
create a demand for buildings constructed with local materials like granite,
bricks from clay, vegetable fiber, etc.”. Anicet will design the school
building and supervise the construction. 
Mark Huelsenbeck: Mark is an American volunteer
in Dassa-Zoumé. He has worked at CEG Kpingni for the past 2 years facilitating a
weekly environmental club with around 30 students. Mark will be responsible for
monitoring and evaluating the project.

</p><p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>Hi! Thanks for stopping by. </p>
<p>My name is Esbeida Flores. I
am a student at Ivy
 Tech Community
  College in Indiana.
I just finished my third semester towards a fine arts degree. There’s a detail
and it’s that I am undocumented. </p>
<p>Now, let me tell you guys how
that happened. </p>
<p>Since I was born and up until
the age of 9 I lived in Mexico.
I lived in this little house with my mom, my brother, and my father. We had to
deal with economic problems, barely having enough to survive. Not only that, my
father was an alcoholic. He was a very serious and short-tempered man as it was
but the biggest problem is that he got violent when he was drunk. I was blessed
with a good memory, so I remember sometimes more than I’d like to. </p>
<p>I remember that if my dad was
not home by 9:30pm we knew
he was going to come late into the night drunk. The three of us would wait in
silence trying to brace ourselves for what we knew was coming. This went on for
years (before I was even born) and it got so bad to the point that our nervous
systems couldn’t take it anymore. Because of the trauma we went through we
started to physically get sick and that’s when my mom decided to bring us here
to the U.S.</p>
<p>And I will forever be grateful
to her for taking us out of that life and giving us the chance to start over. I
always wondered why she didn’t left earlier but I guess she thought it was
better for us to have a father than not have one, until there was proof that
that was not the case. When we got here I wanted to make my mom proud and my
way of thanking her was to do my best in school. I always knew I was going to
college I didn’t know how I just knew I would. So in the meantime I kept
working. Not just in my academics but also working hard at getting better with
my art since I always knew that’s what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Senior year in High School I
dedicated myself to researching as much as I could to know to how to get myself
to college. That’s when I found out about HB1402. This bill makes undocumented
students pay out of state tuition. So instead of paying 3,000 a year I have to
pay over 6,500 dollars. My family is not able to help me economically since my
mom is currently unemployed and my brother is the only source of income. So that’s
a huge amount of money especially since I have to come up with it on my own. To
be honest it was devastating it felt like everything I had worked for was
collapsing to the ground.</p>
<p>That was when I started to
apply to as many scholarships as I could. I told myself that if I got even only
one I would do everything I could to finish. So it happened. I have this
scholarship from which I receive $2,000 a year. That covered a little over half
from 1<sup>st</sup> semester. But I have no other scholarships to help me with
this upcoming semester.</p>
<p>I would like to keep moving
forward with my education and what I set out to do. I want to make my family
proud and one day give back a little of what they’ve given me. My ultimate
dream would be to someday open up an art gallery/community center. Now, I don’t
know how that’s going to happen yet but I figure I will cross that bridge when
I get to it. For now I have this one problem, tuition for next spring. So
that’s why I’m here today to ask for your help. </p>
<p>I am looking to raise $3,450. This would cover
my tuition costs for the spring semester. And if you could donate anything, a
dollar, or even if you can’t if you could just share this with someone who
might be interested in donating you will already have a huge part in helping me
get an education.</p>
<p>I am determined to keep working hard because I
really believe I can do this. I have been working on some projects to give to
anyone who contributes. And I promise you that when you get your bookmark,
postcard or print you will know that you have made a difference in someone’s
life.<br/><b><span><br/>The Impact</span></b><br/>If you would like to know the
actual breakdown of how it goes: <br/></p><p>
Each course is $751 and there is a $60 technology fee. Now, the reason I need
to take 12 credit hours (4 courses) is that one of the requirements to get the
scholarship that helps me in the fall is for me to be a full time student both
semesters. So any donation will be helping me TREMENDOUSLY. I won’t have to
worry every day about where and how I am going to get money to pay Ivy Tech. My
ultimate dream is to be educated in the field of fine arts and one day open up
an art gallery/community center. I want to help other students get to
information and resources when they are still in high school so they won’t have
to go through the frustration I had to go through when I had to do it all on my
own. If I can share my knowledge and make the road easier for those who come
after me that will be the greatest feeling in the world. Anything you could do
to help me now will already be huge to get there in the end. I can’t even begin
to articulate how thankful and how much this would all mean not just to me but
to my family as well.</p>
<p>If don’t reach my goal everything
I do raise (minus 9% that go to indiegogo) will all go towards paying tuition.
If something absolutely amazing were to happen and I raise more than the listed
amount I will pay off tuition, rent the math book for the math course I’ll be
taking, and maybe get art supplies I will need for classes such as a new
sketchbook, paint etc. In other words it will all go exclusively towards education.
(4% goes to indiegogo)</p>
<p><b>The
Perks</b><br/>
I have been working hard on various projects to send anyone who contributes!
I’ve got some key-chains, bookmarks, postcards, thank-you cards, and even
prints! Some of them are digitally-made and some are hand-made, scanned then
printed. The originals will also be available for certain donations. With the exception
of postcards and thank-you cards all goodies will be mailed after the campaign
is over. I will do this just so I will have a set number of how much I need so
I won’t have a shortage or surplus of anything. There are more details about

<p><span>The Story of Iconoclast Books began with a starry eyed bookseller who opened a humble downstairs shop on Fourth St. twenty years ago.  Over time, the store grew to become a town institution.  We are a meeting spot, a study hall, a performance space, a play room, an idea factory, a launch pad for flights of fancy for young and old alike.  In our store, friends meet for tea, authors speak, musicians perform, children learn to read, curiosity is aroused. Customers and causes count on us to support or be their partner – The Community Library, the Sun Valley Writers' Conference, the SV Center for the Arts, the Trailing of the Sheep Festival, Schools and book fairs, seasonal festivals and more.  </span></p><p><span>We have grown with the community, while honoring the legacy of the store and the needs of our neighbors.  </span></p><p>Like all good tales, we've had our share of dragons, especially in the six years since the loss of my husband and business partner, Gary Hunt.  We've suffered from the  impact of the recession, the seizing of our locally owned bank, and the rise of online competition.  Last summer we all experienced the most difficult summer we've had when the Beaver Creek fires caused the evacuation of our valley during the most profitable time of year.  Additionally, the impact of Amazon and its egregious attempts to put bricks and mortar stores out of business, is possibly the biggest dragon to slay.  </p><p>Our recent efforts to downsize the store to meet both our financial obligations and the needs of the store look to be a part of a successful formula and though it's been melancholic watching the history and Gary's touch on the store leave by the truckload, we feel hopeful that with these changes and your help we can continue to be your community hub for another 20 years.  </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/580460/files/20140514181335-IconoDeadline.png?1400116415"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">But first, a bit more of the Icono story and our recent downsize here:  <a href=""http://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/nakedbookseller/iconoclast-books/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Los Angeles Review of Books ~ 20 Years of Iconoclastic Bookselling</a>  as well as a few photos of our tale.  </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Way back when...</p><p></p><p></p><p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span style=""line-height: 30px;letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;""></span></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/580583/files/20140514194339-gary1996.png?1400121819"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><br/></span>And now...<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/580586/files/20140514194511-store.png?1400121911"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span><br/></span>Our commitment to our valley's youth and the thousands who visit each year, is to maintain the best selection and the most knowledgeable staff to help your kiddos, just as we helped you years ago! <span><br/></span> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/580589/files/20140514194628-kidsreading.png?1400121988"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span><br/></span>Our renowned Author Events, where we've had the pleasure of listening to their words and witnessed a few dance on table tops, break into song, down growlers of beer, paint the wall with their autographs, make us weep, laugh and think.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/580590/files/20140514194655-carolek.png?1400122015"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span><br/></span>Some of our favorite occasions each month, in-store or in Town Square: Our incredible Open Mic Nights and Poetry Slams.

Customers and causes count on us to support or be their partner – The Community Library, the Sun Valley Writers' Conference, the SV Center for the Arts, the Trailing of the Sheep Festival, Schools and book fairs, seasonal festivals and more.  We have grown with the community, while honoring the legacy of the store and the needs of our neighbors.  Like all good tales, we've had our share of dragons, especially in the six years since the loss of my husband and business partner, Gary Hunt.  We've suffered from the  impact of the recession, the seizing of our locally owned bank, and the rise of online competition.  Last summer we all experienced the most difficult summer we've had when the Beaver Creek fires caused the evacuation of our valley during the most profitable time of year.  Additionally, the impact of Amazon and its egregious attempts to put bricks and mortar stores out of business, is possibly the biggest dragon to slay.  Our recent efforts to downsize the store to meet both our financial obligations and the needs of the store look to be a part of a successful formula and though it's been melancholic watching the history and Gary's touch on the store leave by the truckload, we feel hopeful that with these changes and your help we can continue to be your community hub for another 20 years.  But first, a bit more of the Icono story and our recent downsize here:  Los Angeles Review of Books ~ 20 Years of Iconoclastic Bookselling  as well as a few photos of our tale.  Way back when...And now...Our commitment to our valley's youth and the thousands who visit each year, is to maintain the best selection and the most knowledgeable staff to help your kiddos, just as we helped you years ago!  Our renowned Author Events, where we've had the pleasure of listening to their words and witnessed a few dance on table tops, break into song, down growlers of beer, paint the wall with their autographs, make us weep, laugh and think. Some of our favorite occasions each month, in-store or in Town Square: Our incredible Open Mic Nights and Poetry Slams. Mark our words - these two will be famous musicians one day! 
The impact of the fires and Amazon have created a difficult environment and we have fallen seriously behind on rent and with some of our most beloved vendors.  Many of these vendors are local -  people who have been our partners for years.

Approximately $55,000 to back rent and late fees. 

$30,000 to local vendors, authors and publishers.  

If we exceed this goal we will continue to pay down bills to publishers and outstanding loans.   


Additional funds to pay down balances owed to publishers, outstanding loans and debts.  Among these: The SBA disaster relief loan (2007 Castle Rock fires), back taxes, line of credit and revolving accounts.  Approximately $250,000. We are in good standing with these debts, but they are preventing us from moving forward.  

At the time of Gary's death I made the decision to accept Letters of Testamentary which made me solely responsible for his actions.  Possibly an unwise decision, but one I made because I didn't want to lose him AND the bookstore.  The burden of the store's debt was far greater than I imagined,  yet all of these years later, with some of it paid off, I feel even more strongly about keeping up the fight.  We've had wonderful support from our landlord, a record-breaking year in sales during the height of the recession, and I've been able to pay off many of our creditors while not incurring any new debt.  Our community has been quite vocal this week about the importance of keeping our doors open.  We've determined that Iconoclast Books is an undeniable asset to this community, but for continued growth and sustainability, we need to pay off the debt I inherited.  Despite the bleak picture I've outlined, the store continues to grow and be refined with the changes in the economy and technology.  We've identified many areas that will be profit centers or add value to our community if we can redirect debt payments towards expansion. 
More Children's Programming - from art classes to poetry projects.
Gift and Travel store - We've identified many products - that go beautifully with books - that do not exist in the valley.  
A Cafe upgrade, with a secret too great to share at this time! 
Sidelines, sidelines and more sidelines!  Our card selection has been the best in the valley for years and we've numerous ways to get even better, including other unexpected necessities.  
Beer and wine license, because what goes with books as well as our locally roasted, organic coffee does?  Yes, wine. 
Writers in Residence Program  - A dream of ours for a long time and one we believe we can play a large role in creating. 

We realize this is an enormous amount of money to ask for, especially in a small community.  You can help this campaign by sharing it wherever you can, here in the valley and outside.  Get the message and into the hands and hearts of people who care about Independent Bookstores.  
Give what you can.  We'll remember you forever!  (Check out the perks, you could have a shelf named after you!) 
Please share this campaign via email with those who may be able to help;  notes saying that Iconoclast Books is a favorite store of yours or your children, go along way.    
Post it ALL OVER your social media.  People have passion for Indie Bookstores! 
Share it even if someone cannot help ~ they may pass it along to someone who is able to.  
Check out our donor gifts and spread the word that a little money will go a long way!  
Lastly, but very importantly, consider ditching the amazon ""buy now"" button and have a real experience with people who love books!  If you're an e-reader, you can buy your e-books through our website!  

                       This is your community, your store.  We thank you deeply for the first 20 years and hope to be here to serve you for another 20!  THAT would be a happy ending!  Note ~ We have a video coming and will shorten the length of this campaign.    Check back in a few days where there will be new perks, as well!",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>
</div><div>I grew up loving music and the cello more than anything else in life. I've wanted nothing more than to be able to reach my audiences with my music and make a difference in their lives with it! Although the benefits of being a performer are huge, they also come with a price. I've endured a long and hard road as a student and musician these last 5 years during my undergrad at Central Washington University. I've had amazing opportunities, travelled to really cool places to compete and perform, made music with great friends, and have learned a ton, but I had a dark shadow following me everywhere I went that no one knew about. That figure was anxiety and depression. The pressure to be perfect was unmatched and I spiraled further and further down the hole of depression until I came to a place of self-loathing. I had forgotten the most important thing I held dear: music is not about being <i>perfect</i>. Music is about sharing a piece of myself, exposing my spirit, becoming vulnerable, giving my audience the opportunity to experience something unique, and opening the eyes of my listeners to their <i>own</i> souls. Having forgotten this, I came to do the unthinkable. At a time in my life where everything seemed to be crashing down around me, I tried to commit suicide. I overdosed on xanax and alcohol and began cutting myself. I was found by my roommate and after a string of phone calls had been made, my parents decided to pull me out of school and put me on a medical leave. I underwent months of counseling, physical therapy, and other doctors appointments, having no idea what the outcome would be, but I just kept trudging on. </div><div>This was the worst thing I have ever gone through, but I made it out on the other side. I have God and the gift of music he gave me to thank for that. Having to rebuild myself from the foundation up, I learned once again what it meant to be an artist. I learned it's ok to not be perfect, to learn from my mistakes, and to love what I do and stand by my craft no matter what happens. <b>I learned to love music again for the <i>sake of music</i>. </b>My passion for playing the cello and God's promise that he would provide, is what made me fight this ugly condition and come out of this place as a better human being and artist. After having taken so much time off from school, I didn't think it was possible to finish on time and attend grad school the following year. But with hard work, doubling up on classes my last two quarters, and preparing my best for auditions, I graduated this spring with my undergraduate degree and got accepted to study at the Glenn Gould School of the Royal Conservatory in Toronto! I am also off every medication I had been on for the last two years and am the happiest I have been in a long time. I have experienced the lowest of lows and the highest of highs in the span of 9 months. This is an incredible opportunity but I need financial support in order to make it a reality. I'm coming from the small town of Ellensburg, WA, where the rent is 1/4 of what it will be in Toronto, ON. It's a huge gap and I will need all the help I can get to make this transition! Every little bit helps. Thank you for reading my story and for your support! </div><div><i>This was a very personal experience I chose to share, but I'm doing so in order to magnify the power of music and what it has done in my life. Thank you for your time and I hope this has helped someone who needed to read it! </i></div><div><i><b>Just remember to love what you do, and do what you love. &lt;3</b></i></div><div><br/></div></div>","My Story: Music Heals, Loves, and Inspires

Having forgotten this, I came to do the unthinkable. At a time in my life where everything seemed to be crashing down around me, I tried to commit suicide. I overdosed on xanax and alcohol and began cutting myself. I was found by my roommate and after a string of phone calls had been made, my parents decided to pull me out of school and put me on a medical leave. I underwent months of counseling, physical therapy, and other doctors appointments, having no idea what the outcome would be, but I just kept trudging on. This was the worst thing I have ever gone through, but I made it out on the other side. I have God and the gift of music he gave me to thank for that. Having to rebuild myself from the foundation up, I learned once again what it meant to be an artist. I learned it's ok to not be perfect, to learn from my mistakes, and to love what I do and stand by my craft no matter what happens. I learned to love music again for the sake of music. My passion for playing the cello and God's promise that he would provide, is what made me fight this ugly condition and come out of this place as a better human being and artist. After having taken so much time off from school, I didn't think it was possible to finish on time and attend grad school the following year. But with hard work, doubling up on classes my last two quarters, and preparing my best for auditions, I graduated this spring with my undergraduate degree and got accepted to study at the Glenn Gould School of the Royal Conservatory in Toronto! I am also off every medication I had been on for the last two years and am the happiest I have been in a long time. I have experienced the lowest of lows and the highest of highs in the span of 9 months. This is an incredible opportunity but I need financial support in order to make it a reality. I'm coming from the small town of Ellensburg, WA, where the rent is 1/4 of what it will be in Toronto, ON. It's a huge gap and I will need all the help I can get to make this transition! Every little bit helps. Thank you for reading my story and for your support! This was a very personal experience I chose to share, but I'm doing so in order to magnify the power of music and what it has done in my life. Thank you for your time and I hope this has helped someone who needed to read it! Just remember to love what you do, and do what you love. <3",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

group of 3 individuals (plus many supporters) bringing learning to life in our
fall and spring garden education program.  We are located in Portland,
Oregon, where there’s no shortage of learning opportunities for those
interested in urban farming.  Our garden education
teacher delivers lessons in the children’s garden, a part of Cully
Neighborhood Farm, on property owned by Trinity Lutheran Church. 
Until this summer, the school year ended mid-June, and
we were left to weed, water, and harvest what the students had planted.
 Students returned in the fall, and we harvested those vegetables which
lasted into September.  Students missed out on experiencing the full cycle
of the garden as it was flourishing, and didn't get to see many of the
vegetables they'd planted from seed.  This summer, we’ve been invited to
participate in the summer camp program offered at the school!  That’s
what this fundraiser is about.
Our goal is to have the students who are attending
Trinity's summer camp, along with other children, farm in the children's garden
two days a week from mid-June to late August under the direction of our garden
education teacher. 
Our program has been embraced by the community,
teachers, parents, college supervisors, friends, and, most importantly, the
students.  CYFP continues to expand, and we consistently receive
unequivocally positive reviews from the staff.
The students anticipate their weekly garden lessons,
have eaten vegetables they’ve never even heard of, use “farming” vocabulary,
and can’t get enough of discovering soil, bugs, seeds, etc.
This year, for the first time, students had a cooking
lesson (making pesto), and a huge, end of the year feast, which among other
things, included kale chips, with kale harvested from their garden. 
We know how many people support our mission, and our
hope is that this support will turn into dollars! Help us keep the
momentum of CYFP going!
For further reading about the success of our school
year program, see below:
·       Students continue to gain knowledge
necessary to effectively raise food sources in their own gardens.
·       Students have shown an increased
interest in eating more fruits and vegetables, thus inspiring a healthier
lifestyle.
·       Students have shown a willingness to try
new vegetables, increasing the variety they consume.
·       Teachers have integrated the curriculum
into their own classrooms, thereby enhancing student learning.
·       Students have deepened their connection
with nature and continue to learn about its beauty, power, and fragility.
·       The school garden has enhanced the
beauty of the school grounds. 
·       CYFP hired a certified elementary school
teacher, who delivers expert instruction and continues to align the program
with state science standards.
 
  What We Need & What You Get 
Despite our successful fundraising efforts last year
(we raised $2,500 through indiegogo in August 2013), and several grants (the
Lorenz Family Foundation and East Multnomah Soil and Water Conservation
District), we are unable to fund the summer program and maintain the garden without further
fundraising. Right now, our director and teacher are volunteering their hours, as they have been doing for the last two months! Our goal is to raise $4,500.
Continuing to employ our certified garden education
teacher this summer provides consistency for TLS students, and a guarantee that
lessons will be relevant and inspirational, so that we can engage the children,
from age 5 to 14.  
For your
contribution, you will hear back from one of our students in the form of a drawing or quote, get a tour, or receive a basket of produce.  One of these will remind you of the unbridled enthusiasm of children and how you have
helped make a positive difference in their lives.  
  The Impact
The CYFP has and will continue to foster relationships
between families, congregation members, university students, pre-K-8 students,
and Cully neighborhood residents.  The Cully neighborhood is located in
one of the most economically challenged and ethnically diverse areas of the
city.  CYFP will assist Trinity Lutheran Church's mission of reaching out
into their immediate neighborhood and helping meet the needs of those around
them in whatever way they can.
CYFP will serve as a model for the single family
owners in the Cully neighborhood, many of whom enjoy Cully’s characteristically
large lot sizes and suitability for urban agriculture.
Our summer program will enable the children to
actively participate in maintaining the garden, harvesting produce, and trying
recipes using garden produce.  This is the FIRST year they have this
opportunity to participate in the summer, when the garden is flourishing.
Children’s academic skills will stay sharpened by
using math, reading, and writing.
Participants and their families will have regular
access to green space, in a neighborhood where 2,780 people per acre have
access to parks vs. 40 people per acre citywide.
Participants will:
·       be physically active
·       learn more social skills, working side
by side with other gardeners
·       gain more knowledge about harvesting
vegetables
·       have more opportunities to cook, prepare
food, and try recipes in the school’s commercial kitchen
·       have the opportunity to try a large
variety of vegetables, which are harvested only in the summer
·       continue to deepen their connection with
nature, as they experience flora and fauna unique to the summer season
·       share their enthusiasm for nature and
the garden with family and friends
·       have an extended period of time in the
garden twice a week without being limited by a traditional school schedule
·       witness the operation of Cully
Neighborhood Farm, which serves 32 CSA members
·       have access to the expertise of Matt
Gordon, who runs Cully Neighborhood Farm
·       learn how to compost
Risks & Challenges 
We are such a
small organization, with limited resources, that it is challenging for us to
get the word out about the program and thus secure funds to fulfill our
mission.
We know what
the possibilities are for this program, and we know that with social media and
things like a webpage, we could build up our financial resources.  Lack of time (we have to support ourselves by
other means) and money (mostly to hire a grant writer) – those are what
challenge us the most.

I will be earning my degree in Child and Adolescent studies in the spring. Also I have just been recently engaged to my fiance Joe. I was also recently accepted to the Masters of Socisl Work Program at Cal State Fullerton. I am the first one to go to college in my family, and I have continied to work two to three jobs in order to pay my way through school. I recently found out that when Joe and I have our wedding in March of 2014, we will not be able to go on a honeymoon, because I will be in the midst of my graduate program. Cal State Fullerton is offering a senior trip to Europe, but I figured that I did not want to go one my own without my fiance for ten days, so I really thought nothing of it. Upon calling the organization putting it on, they said Joe is more than welcome to come. Now I am just trying to come up with the money.

<p>Children deserve to play. Children also deserve to feel like they can save the world.  Help make these two ideas can happen through the purchase of play-therapy supplies and the creation of children’s books made specifically for Caribbean children with disabilities.  Your contributions will give the residents of a foster home for disabled children in Grenada the chance to have toys that both accommodate their limitations and empower them towards positive change.</p>
<h2 align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></strong></h2>
<h2 align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">THE BACKGROUND</span></strong></h2>
<p>Sacha Lewis-Stott and Alli Cost organized this project after working and falling in love with these incredible children in Grenada. Sacha is a special education coordinator who spent two years directing the early intervention outreach program which served families from all over Grenada. Alli is an occupational therapist who has worked with the Dorothy Hopkin Centre for the Disabled designing and implementing therapy programs for residents, while also training staff, teachers, and parents.</p>
<p>The Dorothy Hopkin Centre is a foster home for individuals with disabilities.  The diagnoses are varied, ranging from mental retardation, Down’s syndrome, seizure disorders, autism, cerebral palsy, hearing/speech/visual impairments, and genetic abnormalities. This broad array in the severity and type of impairments leads to challenges in creating appropriate play activities that address several residents at once.</p>
<h2 align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></strong></h2>
<h2 align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">WHAT WE NEED AND WHY</span></strong></h2>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">TOYS…so that I can play!</span></h3>
<p>Children use play not only to explore, but also to strengthen their bodies and improve their brain functioning. Play teaches us how to relate with others, problem solve, and interact with the world around us.  </p>
<p>People have good intentions when they donate toys, but most of these residents need toys that are relevant to their specific limitation and strength. For example, it’s hard to know what an ideal toy or tool is for a child who has a type of cerebral palsy that makes it hard for her to use her hands or sit up on her own.</p>
<p>Most of the residents remain at the center long term due to the severity of their disabilities limiting independent living. This is their home and their family; their whole life. Immediate needs of food, shelter, and safety are taken care of by the loving staff. But due to lack of appropriate play items for the residents, there is minimal time spent moving and playing effectively. Your contributions will provide the supplies to create a play area that facilitates therapeutic improvement of speech, language, and physical skills, along with opportunities for positive staff/volunteer and resident interaction.</p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">BOOKS…so that I can save the day!</span></h3>
<p>Stories help us define how we see the world and its potential. Think about the books you read as a child and identified with. Now consider how much more challenging that would be if all the characters you encountered looked, moved, and thought differently from you. Reading a book that’s actually about <em>you </em>provides a sense of power, identity, and belonging in the world.</p>
<p>Although there are a few books with main characters that are disabled, they often focus on the impairment by showing how these “types” of kids fit in, rather than simply having one that is different. And there aren’t any books specifically about Caribbean children with disabilities.</p>
<p>Displaced children, such as those living in orphanages or foster homes like Dorothy Hopkin Centre, often grow up without a secure sense of a family, home or self-identity. Having a disability further challenges the creation of a positive, empowering identity. I want to give these children the opportunity to see themselves in a way that I see them: as independent beautiful individuals who have the ability to solve problems, connect, and grow in their own unique way.</p>
<p>There will be 4 stories in total, at reading levels accommodating the ability of the residents. Three will be at a 1<sup>st</sup> grade reading level and one at a 3<sup>rd</sup> grade reading level.  They will be distributed not only to the residents but also to their schoolteachers so as to allow for educational use. The characters will be based directly off the children at the center. Each book will demonstrate the skills of exploration, self-expression, and problem solving, while being written in a format to facilitate therapeutic and educational use. All of the books will have a page at the end with suggestions for staff and teachers as to how to further discuss the topic and utilize the lessons in real life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Story 1 will be about the children going on walk and identifying local animals and structures, and then using their imagination to see jungle animals and adventures.  This encourages the skill of abstract thinking and safety.</li>
<li>Story 2 will be focused on a dance class, it will show different ways that each person dances. This teaches children about different movement patterns and body awareness.</li>
<li>Story 3 will be built around the cultural events of Grenada and the feelings and activities they encompass. This facilitates children’s self-regulation through sensory preferences and cultural awareness.</li>
<li>Story 4 will be the higher level (3<sup>rd</sup> grade) book and directed at issues facing females in the Caribbean. This teaches women’s empowerment as tangible solutions rather than just a list of issues.</li>

Children use play not only to explore, but also to strengthen their bodies and improve their brain functioning. Play teaches us how to relate with others, problem solve, and interact with the world around us.  
People have good intentions when they donate toys, but most of these residents need toys that are relevant to their specific limitation and strength. For example, it’s hard to know what an ideal toy or tool is for a child who has a type of cerebral palsy that makes it hard for her to use her hands or sit up on her own.
Most of the residents remain at the center long term due to the severity of their disabilities limiting independent living. This is their home and their family; their whole life. Immediate needs of food, shelter, and safety are taken care of by the loving staff. But due to lack of appropriate play items for the residents, there is minimal time spent moving and playing effectively. Your contributions will provide the supplies to create a play area that facilitates therapeutic improvement of speech, language, and physical skills, along with opportunities for positive staff/volunteer and resident interaction.
BOOKS…so that I can save the day!
Stories help us define how we see the world and its potential. Think about the books you read as a child and identified with. Now consider how much more challenging that would be if all the characters you encountered looked, moved, and thought differently from you. Reading a book that’s actually about you provides a sense of power, identity, and belonging in the world.
Although there are a few books with main characters that are disabled, they often focus on the impairment by showing how these “types” of kids fit in, rather than simply having one that is different. And there aren’t any books specifically about Caribbean children with disabilities.
Displaced children, such as those living in orphanages or foster homes like Dorothy Hopkin Centre, often grow up without a secure sense of a family, home or self-identity. Having a disability further challenges the creation of a positive, empowering identity. I want to give these children the opportunity to see themselves in a way that I see them: as independent beautiful individuals who have the ability to solve problems, connect, and grow in their own unique way.
There will be 4 stories in total, at reading levels accommodating the ability of the residents. Three will be at a 1st grade reading level and one at a 3rd grade reading level.  They will be distributed not only to the residents but also to their schoolteachers so as to allow for educational use. The characters will be based directly off the children at the center. Each book will demonstrate the skills of exploration, self-expression, and problem solving, while being written in a format to facilitate therapeutic and educational use. All of the books will have a page at the end with suggestions for staff and teachers as to how to further discuss the topic and utilize the lessons in real life.

Story 1 will be about the children going on walk and identifying local animals and structures, and then using their imagination to see jungle animals and adventures.  This encourages the skill of abstract thinking and safety.
Story 2 will be focused on a dance class, it will show different ways that each person dances. This teaches children about different movement patterns and body awareness.
Story 3 will be built around the cultural events of Grenada and the feelings and activities they encompass. This facilitates children’s self-regulation through sensory preferences and cultural awareness.
Story 4 will be the higher level (3rd grade) book and directed at issues facing females in the Caribbean. This teaches women’s empowerment as tangible solutions rather than just a list of issues.

<h3>NEWS ON TRIP:</h3>
<p><strong>The previous trip I was going on through KIIS was cancelled due to students backing out, and as a result there were not enough people to meet the requirements. However, I have found another program through USAC. The changes in location, funds needed, and deadlines are listed below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>New location: Chengdu, China (<span>成都, 中国）</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>New amount needed due to program change: $3,000. Due to Indiegogo's stipulations i could not change the goal. So, feel free to donate beyond the set goal :)</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Deadline for total payment to USAC: May 1st. If I do not reach my goal, I will post another fundraiser before then. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Sorry for all of the confusion.</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOW FOR THE GOOD STUFF!</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Who I Am</span></strong></p>
<p>My name is Jesse Burleson (薄杰斯）. I am a junior at Middle Tennessee State University. I am an English writing major, and a Global Studies minor.</p>
<p>Traveling the world has always been a dream of mine, and China in particular has taken a special place in my heart. </p>
<p>By donating to this fund you can be a part by helping me gain more insight into the Chinese culture, build upon my existing skills the Chinese language, and fulfill my Global Studies field experience requirement.</p>
<h3>The Trip, and It's Impact</h3>
<p>I have always had a curious spirit which has motivated me to learn about other nations and their people in order to capture the beauty of these cultures, and bring them home. As a writer, this opportunity is a tremendous start for this process.</p>
<p>I will arrive in Chengdu China in Sichuan province on May 24th. After settling in for a couple days I will start my month long studies which include: Intermediate Chinese 1, a Chinese Conversation course, and a study of Chinese Culture and Social Cognition. These course credits will help me gain insight into China's culture, and also go towards my English BA major and my Global Studies Minor helping me graduate even sooner! After 5 weeks of studying in China I will return to the US around July 6th.</p>
<p>This journey will not only engulf me in the Chinese culture, but also serve as a foot in the door for future endeavours in China where I hope to one day teach English.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Needs</h3>
<p>Overall trip is going to cost me around 7 1/2 thousand dollors. Through scholarships and a student loan I have payed for a little more than half of it. My airfare still remains which is somewhere between $2,100-2,500 along with about another $750 due to the differences in housing, meals;etc between the programs. What you donate will literally make my way to the beautiful land of China.</p>
<p>If I reach or even exceed my goal, all of the money will being going towards my airfare and other educational costs; however, 4% will be go to Indiegogo, and another 3% will be given to the card companies for processing fees. If I do not meet my goal, 9% of any money raised will go to Indiegogo along with the additional 3% for processing. So what do you say, will you help me reach my goal?</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you cannot contribute  financially, you can help by spreading the word! I can use all the help I can get! So, if you will share this on Facebook, through e-mail, or even just by word of mouth it would help my cause tremendously. Any and all you do is appreciated.</p>

<ul><li style=""font-size: 13pt;"">We want to give something back. <b>50% of our profits will go back to Free Software and Linux communities</b>, and our readership will choose where the money goes. We want to sponsor projects, events, developers, and evangelise the cause. We want to build long-term relationships with the people we sponsor, so there's less uncertainty for projects year-on-year. <br/>
</li></ul><ul><li style=""font-size: 13pt;"">Our first issue will be <b>better than any other Linux and Free Software magazine</b>. We've got the brain share, the provenance and an unrivalled motivation to succeed. We know our readership, which is why our focus will always be on the quality of content. We've been bucking the trend of declining print sales for years, and we're not going to stop now by messing around with the magic formula. We want to make a larger magazine with a broader scope and more representative content. We want to be fair and accurate. We want to be the voice of the Linux and open source community, but above all, we want to help that community to grow.</li></ul><ul><li style=""font-size: 13pt;"">
<b>Our pricing will always be fair</b>. Magazines are expensive to create (see FAQ for more details), but we want to remove much of the mystery. We're going to charge a flat rate for a baseline print or digital subscription and only charge cost for distribution. This won’t make our magazine dramatically cheaper in the UK, where we're based, but it will make the magazine much cheaper elsewhere. We won't have community sapping fire sales or unpredictable marketing strategies. The price we charge is the cost of making the best magazine we can, and nothing else.</li></ul><ul><li style=""font-size: 13pt;"">
<b>Our content will be published for free after 9 months</b>, and we aim to use an open source/Creative Commons licence.

<p style=""font-size: 13pt;""><strong>Q. Isn't the print and magazine business dead?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13pt;"">A. No. Our previous magazine grew its print circulation last year, making it one of only a handful of publications to do so in the UK. If you’ve got a strong community and low overheads, there’s no reason why a magazine like Linux Voice can’t flourish.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-size: 13pt;""><strong>Q. When will you get the first issue out?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13pt;"">A. We're already working on it, and depending on print schedules, we'd like to get our first issue in the post in February 2014.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-size: 13pt;""><strong>Q. Will Linux Voice be available in shops and newsagents?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13pt;"">A. Yes. We want it to be. But the big shops won't listen to us until we’ve got plenty of readers. This campaign will solve that problem and we’ll be able to negotiate with them after a successful campaign. And if you want to sell our magazine in your own store, get in touch!</p>
<br/><p style=""font-size: 13pt;""><strong>Q. Will Linux Voice include a DVD?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13pt;"">A. We'd love to have a DVD packed with distros, software, video tutorials, magazine articles and more. But DVDs take extra time and money to make, so we need to gauge interest first: if you're interested, please let us know in the comments tab above and we'll add a perk later in the campaign.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-size: 13pt;""><strong>Q. Will you create an interactive HTML 5/Ubuntu/Android/iOS/Windows 8 app for digital magazine delivery?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13pt;"">A. We will get our magazine onto digital storefronts straight away. And we have ambitious plans for our own app - one where our community becomes part of the editorial. But to start with, we need to focus on getting our new magazine out of our heads and into your hands. We’ll then be able to invest in our other ideas.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-size: 13pt;""><strong>Q. Why can't you commit to releasing your content under an open source/Creative Commons licence now?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13pt;"">A. We want to talk to our contributors first. Our competitors take copyright ownership over the content they commission, and we'd like to do the right thing and give this back to our authors. That means we'll then need their permission if we release their work under a Creative Commons licence.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-size: 13pt;""><strong>Q: When distribution is effectively free, why are the digital subscription prices so expensive?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13pt;"">A. Print and distribution is only a relatively small part of the overall expense. To show our commitment to transparency, and also address what seems a popular misconception, here’s our estimated costs for a single issue:</p>
<ul><li style=""font-size: 13pt;"">Contributors: We pay a typical rate of £100 per page to our contributors, and we’ll need around 44 pages of content not written by ourselves each issue. That’s £4,400.</li></ul><ul><li style=""font-size: 13pt;"">Design/Art: It’s a skilled full time job designing and laying out a magazine and we need to work with someone awesome who understands our style and content. We estimate that person will cost £2,500 per month. Plus, we’ll need additional artwork for the cover and features. A typical issue would require around £400 of art, bringing the Design/Art total to £2,900.</li></ul><ul><li style=""font-size: 13pt;"">Hardware/software: We’re going to need a bare minimum of equipment, plus the software. Our estimates for a year put this at £8,000, which divides down to £666 per issue. </li></ul><p style=""font-size: 13pt;"">That’s a grand total of £7,966 per issue. Divide this by the 2,000 subscribers we need for a successful campaign and we have a per issue cost of £3.98.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 13pt;"">This price doesn’t include printing, distribution, VAT or the percentage taken by app stores, PayPal and Indiegogo. Nor does it include our salaries, but we’re obviously hoping to attract more subscribers over the twelve months following a successful campaign.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-size: 13pt;""><strong>Q: Will the magazine be produced using open source software?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13pt;"">A. Initially, for speed and efficiency, we need to use what we used before, and that's Adobe InDesign. But we want to make a commitment to work with free software projects such as Inkscape and Scribus with the intention of migrating from proprietary software when it’s feasible to do so.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-size: 13pt;""><strong>Q: I've never heard of the previous magazine you allude to. How can I trust you?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13pt;"">A. Read the stuff we've written over the last thirteen years. Read the Google Play reviews written prior to our departure (September/October 2013). Listen to the things we've said, listen to our previous podcasts and read the comments. Linux Voice is going to be even better.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-size: 13pt;""><strong>Q: I already have a subscription to another magazine. What can I do?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13pt;"">A. Contact their customer support lines. In many cases you can cancel an existing subscription. For Future magazines, for example, phone 0844 848 2852 (UK) or +44 1604 251 045 (international). If your subscription is with Imagine Publishing, call +44 (0)1202 586200.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-size: 13pt;""><strong>Q: Why can I only pay with PayPal?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13pt;"">A. That's just a limitation of Indiegogo with fixed funding.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-size: 13pt;""><strong>Q. Is Graham Morrison involved in this campaign?</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 13pt;"">A. Graham Morrison, the editor of our previous magazine, quit at the same time but a restrictive covenant in his employment contract means he can't be involved in any similar activity until 20th December 2013. <strong>Update (20/12/2013):</strong> Graham has joined the team!

Announcing Linux VoiceWe were the majority of the editorial team behind Linux Format magazine.Over many years, we helped make our title the market leader. We interviewed everyone we could think of, crammed each issue full of tutorials, reviews and thought-provoking features, and spread the good word about Linux, open source and Free Software.We were the first to cover the Raspberry Pi from the newsstand. We beat the C.I.A. before it was cool. We sent a comfort package to Edward Snowden, and taught the world how easy servers were to hack (er, sorry, crack). Our fortnightly TuxRadar podcast entertained thousands of insightful and generous listeners, and we loved every minute of it.Last month we quit, and we quit because we wanted to do something different. We want to create an even better magazine; a bigger, more entertaining and more accountable magazine for the community we love to serve. The magazine we want to make is called Linux Voice.Who we areGraham Morrison is the former Editor of Linux Format. He worked on the magazine for nine years after starting out as its staff writer in 2004. He also has a slight obsession with analogue synthesizers.Graham's articles on TechRadar | Linux Format
Andrew Gregory is the former Deputy Editor and Operations Editor of Linux Format. He dreamt up many of the ideas that went into the magazine, and also wrote tutorials, features and the news section.Andrew's articles on TechRadar | Linux Format
Mike Saunders has written for Linux Format since the very first issue, and also worked as the New Media and Communities Editor. He's a passionate Free Software developer and still plays Frontier.Mike's articles on TechRadar | Linux Format
Ben Everard worked on Linux Format for two years, writing features, reviews and tutorials, and creating the software-packed DVD that came with the mag. He has helped to spread Free Software in the developing world.Ben's articles on TechRadar | Linux Format
What makes Linux Voice different?
We want to give something back. 50% of our profits will go back to Free Software and Linux communities, and our readership will choose where the money goes. We want to sponsor projects, events, developers, and evangelise the cause. We want to build long-term relationships with the people we sponsor, so there's less uncertainty for projects year-on-year. 
Our first issue will be better than any other Linux and Free Software magazine. We've got the brain share, the provenance and an unrivalled motivation to succeed. We know our readership, which is why our focus will always be on the quality of content. We've been bucking the trend of declining print sales for years, and we're not going to stop now by messing around with the magic formula. We want to make a larger magazine with a broader scope and more representative content. We want to be fair and accurate. We want to be the voice of the Linux and open source community, but above all, we want to help that community to grow.
Our pricing will always be fair. Magazines are expensive to create (see FAQ for more details), but we want to remove much of the mystery. We're going to charge a flat rate for a baseline print or digital subscription and only charge cost for distribution. This won’t make our magazine dramatically cheaper in the UK, where we're based, but it will make the magazine much cheaper elsewhere. We won't have community sapping fire sales or unpredictable marketing strategies. The price we charge is the cost of making the best magazine we can, and nothing else.
Our content will be published for free after 9 months, and we aim to use an open source/Creative Commons licence. We want to create a library of our tutorials, interviews, features and code that is accessible to everyone, whether that's a Python tutorial for a 10 hour flight, or a Raspberry Pi class guide for a school club. We don't believe in charging several times for the same 'evergreen' content. UPDATE: We've committed to making all the content available under CC-BY-SA after nine months. For more details see our blog here.(Sample tutorial - click for bigger)

A. Graham Morrison, the editor of our previous magazine, quit at the same time but a restrictive covenant in his employment contract means he can't be involved in any similar activity until 20th December 2013. Update (20/12/2013): Graham has joined the team! Yippeee!",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Why Housing Assistance matters to Veronica's kids</h3>
<p>I'm Veronica's former neighbor and close friend, and I know how important it is that she and her children keep their rent assistance </p>
<ul>
<li>to stay together as a family under one roof</li>
<li>to keep a solid home base for school</li>
<li>to avoid the heartbreak of losing their belongings</li>
</ul>
<p>Veronica's housing assistance pays most of their monthly rent right now, and it caps her rent at 30% of her income.  Without it, she and her kids will lose their current home.  And they have only about a week to come up with the money to keep it.</p>
<p>The family shelter in St. Paul is a day shelter where families are bussed at 5 pm to churches to sleep.  Let's all pitch in now to keep Serenity, Butta, Juicy, Jawon, Ariah and Johny from being the kids on that bus.</p>
<h3>What we can do</h3>
<p>Only $500 will settle Veronica's differences with her former landlord and prevent an ""eviction"" strike from ending her housing assistance.  If everyone who cares pitches in just a little bit, we can help them over this hurdle.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Your small contribution now will be multiplied each time the rent gets paid--this month, next month, and for many months to come.  It will matter every time the family uses their home as a base for success in school and work.  </p>
<p>Any funds contributed will go directly to Veronica's settlement with her old landlord.</p>
<p>Anything leftover will go directly to the family.  It will buy an affordable family swim pass or pay for a good fan for their second story duplex.  However generous or humble, your gift will keep on giving all summer long and into the future.</p>
<p>Like the kids in the 60 minutes video link attached, Veronica's kids have suffered a lot from scarcity. This campaign can show them that they're not in this struggle alone.  They're surrounded by people who care, who believe in them, and who know they deserve a safe, stable home.</p>
<h3><strong>Joining hands was never easier</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Indiegogo, Facebook, and Twitter make lending a hand and combining small contributions easier than ever before.  Putting out a small fire now often prevents a disaster later.  </p>
<p>We can pick up these tools and use them when people we know and love are facing a housing crisis.  We can take a stand against poverty instead of turning our heads away from the growing number of kids living with less.</p>
<p>Consider it ""volunteer firefighting"" against a different sort of threat to a family home.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Please spread the word</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Every little bit helps.  Through this campaign, we'll add whatever you can afford to whatever the rest of us can afford until we have enough money to make a difference.  Even if you have no cash to spare right now, you can still share the love, spread the word, and help the cause.</p>
<p>Post this campaign on Facebook and twitter--wherever you can.  Add your messages of hope to Veronica and her whole family.  Give them something to celebrate this fourth of July.  </p>

told…</span></h2>
<h2 class=""MsoNormal""><span style='font-family: ""Times New Roman"",""serif"";'>1,500

adult in the home is being abused. </span></h2>
<h2 class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style='font-family: ""Times New Roman"",""serif"";'>We were

each PSA we produce. For this fist PSA, the anti domestic violence PSA, we will
focus on the effect that domestic violence has on the victims <i style="""">and</i> witnesses of domestic violence as
well as others in society who encounter the witnesses later in life. The PSA
will launch in October 2011, which is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. </span></h2><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</span><h2 class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style='font-family: ""Times New Roman"",""serif"";'>Since PADV is our direct partner for this
particular PSA, we will share the PSA with them for use on the PADV.org Web
site. However, we expect our reach for this PSA, and others in the “Peace
Begins At Home” series, to go well beyond that. We will make each PSA available
to organizations with similar anti violence interests, local and national
broadcast television stations and various Internet outlets. We also plan to
expand the campaigns into other media—print ads, posters, etc.—as money and
opportunities permit. Once people embrace the concept that peace does truly
begin at home, it will be a seed that will grow in homes throughout America,
positively affecting society for generations.</span></h2>

We saw
the research…
1 in 4:
That’s the number of women who will experience domestic abuse in her lifetime.
We were surprised. 
We heard
the statistic…
3: That’s
the daily tally of women killed by their husbands or boyfriends. We were
appalled. 
We were
told…
1,500
times: That’s how much more likely a child is to suffer domestic abuse when an
adult in the home is being abused. 
We were
saddened, which inspired us to act, which brought us here, to IndieGoGo.

The violence—in all forms—must stop. That
is why we, Women In Film &
Television Atlanta (WIFTA), have decided to launch a public service campaign
(PSA) against violence. For the first PSA in the campaign, we’ve committed to
creating an anti domestic
violence PSA and have selected Partnership Against
Domestic Violence (PADV) as our partner in this endeavor. In the future, with
your support, we hope to produce additional PSAs. However, this is where it all
begins. By creating this anti
domestic violence PSA, we are taking our first step forward in being the change
we wish to see in the world; by donating today, you will be taking a step with
us.

IMPACT
The overarching theme of the anti
violence campaign is “Peace Begins At Home.” The concept will be the basis of
each PSA we produce. For this fist PSA, the anti domestic violence PSA, we will
focus on the effect that domestic violence has on the victims and witnesses of domestic violence as
well as others in society who encounter the witnesses later in life. The PSA
will launch in October 2011, which is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. 
Since PADV is our direct partner for this
particular PSA, we will share the PSA with them for use on the PADV.org Web
site. However, we expect our reach for this PSA, and others in the “Peace
Begins At Home” series, to go well beyond that. We will make each PSA available
to organizations with similar anti violence interests, local and national
broadcast television stations and various Internet outlets. We also plan to
expand the campaigns into other media—print ads, posters, etc.—as money and
opportunities permit. Once people embrace the concept that peace does truly
begin at home, it will be a seed that will grow in homes throughout America,
positively affecting society for generations.
 
WHAT WE NEED
First
and foremost, we need you. The funding goal we’ve set is the minimum we need to
produce the anti domestic violence PSA. Without your help, this first PSA in
our series, nor subsequent PSAs, will be possible.
Since we
are WIFTA, we have the talent within our organization to produce the “Peace
Begins At Home” PSAs. Our members have agreed to donate (ie. they’re not
charging us!) their time and expertise to work as crew for the anti domestic
violence PSA. That’s a huge cost—upwards of $5,000 in itself—that we will not incur!
What we cannot escape, however, are costs for equipment, actors, studio /
location fees, props, general supplies, production insurance, editing and
post-production sound as well as communications with television stations,
Internet outlets and other anti-domestic abuse organizations of the PSA’s
availability for their use / distribution. Again, PADV will not incur any costs
whatsoever; our work on this PSA is our community service gift to PADV. 
WIFTA
is a registered 501(c) 3 nonprofit organization. As such, all events and
projects we are able to do are based on support from donations. For each PSA we
hope to launch, we will need funding. This is why your donation, which may be
tax deductible, and assistance in informing others of our plight is critical.
We cannot do this alone.

***NOTE:
If
you are company or organization that wishes to sponsor any portion of the
production through in-kind donations or to become a general sponsor of the PSA
in an amount of $500+, please contact us directly regarding cross-promotional
opportunities.

 
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
Part of
the reason why violence is so prevalent and viral is because people ignore it,
they feel that their efforts to stop it won’t matter or they’re too scared to
act; some even think that if the violence isn’t happening to them, it doesn’t
effect and affect them. They’re wrong. Violence impacts us all. So, here are four
ways that you can help us in this battle against violence:

1.     
Make a
donation so we can produce the first anti violence PSA!


2.     
Share
this page on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. and ask people to donate
whatever they can as well. 


3.     
If it’s
not already there, create peace in your home and start talking about domestic
violence. Remember: 1 in 4 women experience domestic violence. Is it someone
you know? Are their children being abused too…or could they be? Start the
dialogue.

<p>My name is Angela Congrove, and I’m a student at The University of Iowa. This summer I am planning on participating in a Japanese language program called APU Gateway Summer Program at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University in Beppu, Oita, Japan. It has been my goal this past year to participate in a summer program to study Japanese, but my dreams are in danger of being out of reach.</p>
<p>I’ve done all I can do to prepare, and it seems the hand of fate has delt me a difficult card. Although I’ve paid my program fees, the departure date is approaching faster than I can receive my financial aid to purchase plane tickets. I depart on May 31<sup>st</sup>, however my financial aid is coming too close to the date to afford a decently priced ticket. On top of the ticket price, I need finances to insure that I will be able to feed and take care of myself while abroad. Any money that is contributed will be put towards my plane tickets and my immediate needs in Japan.</p>
<p>Last fall I transferred to The University of Iowa, where it was necessary for me to retake 2<sup>nd</sup> year Japanese. I’m near the end of the course now, and it has been worth it, but I have a strong feeling of being behind where I need to be. This summer course is valuable to me, and I would be very disappointed if I had to miss out because of a money issue. It’s because of my aspirations to become fluent in Japanese that I set up this fund raiser.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The typical airfare price to Japan ranges from $1500 – $2500. For my case, I will be booking later and the price will be on the higher end. Any money donated will immediately be put towards my airfare. Once I can purchase airfare, I will then use all other money to pay for food and other living expenses.</p>
<p>IndieGoGo takes 2 weeks at most to send money raised to the campaign creator. For this reason, I can only keep this campaign open for ONE WEEK. I wish I could keep it longer, but I simply cannot wait that long to purchase airfare.</p>
<p>To make this worth your while, I am offering to use some of my talents towards the perks on this page. I am skilled in drawing and writing/covering songs, and I wish to create something for you in return for a donation. Please take a look at the perks I am offering on the side of the page.<br/> You can listen to some of my songs here: <a href=""http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=499116"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=499116</a><br/> You can view some of my artwork here: <a href=""http://musicalgrl1016.deviantart.com/gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://musicalgrl1016.deviantart.com/gallery/</a></p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal, I will put all funds raised towards my plane tickets. If I am unable to afford the ticket and end up staying in the States this summer, I will put the money towards my tuition in summer or fall semester classes.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>It’s my goal to someday contribute to the global community as a translator, interpreter, or English teacher. I’ve been interested in Japanese culture since I was a kid, and I hope to spread the love I have for the country through helping our countries connect through translation.</p>
<p>I’ve always told myself that money doesn’t matter. It’s times like these that I am reminded that money is what makes the world go around.

The native Indians of America call themselves the ""people of the corn"" and have formed rituals and ceremonies around the planting, harvesting and saving of the corn seed. The Venda people of South Africa consider millet seed the most sacred seed s it connects them to <em>Mupo</em>, the Creation, the source of their lives, since when they were first created. It is an indigenous seed that is used in all of their spiritual ceremonies.

They are called  F-1. Often times breeding compromises genetic expression, diversity, nutrition and seed saving. It is often unwittingly a process of removing valuable genetic material thus making a plant susceptible to disease and pathogens. However bred plants are more uniform in growth, production and appearance.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/492133/files/20140408001314-green_bean.jpg?1396941194"" src="""" style=""width: 305px; height: 305px;""/></p><p><strong>Dehybridization</strong> occurs when a selected Hybrid offspring (f-1) becomes a stabilized open – pollinated cultivar; selecting the same offspring for 5 or more successive planting seasons in order to create desired characteristics at the compromise of genetic expression, diversity and nutrition. The end result is an open pollinated<br/>hybrid created simply by a process of removing - breeding out valuable genetic<br/>material thus making a plant susceptible to disease and pathogens. Most of the<br/>so-called Heirlooms are actually pseudo-heirlooms created through this<br/>process of Dehybridization.</p><p><b>Mutation Breeding</b> is the process of exposing seeds to chemicals<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemicals"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a> or radiation<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a> in order to generate mutants with desirable traits to be bred with other cultivars<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivars"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>. Plants created using mutagenesis are sometimes called mutagenic plants or mutagenic seeds. From 1930–2007 more than 2540 mutagenic plant varieties have been released that have been derived either as direct mutants (70%) or from their progeny (30%).<sup>.</sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_breeding#cite_note-2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a> Crop plants account for 75% of released mutagenic species.</p><p>Unlike genetically modified crops, which typically involve the insertion of one or two target genes, plants developed via mutagenic processes with random, multiple and unspecific genetic changes <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_breeding#cite_note-10"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>have been discussed as a concern<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_breeding#cite_note-11"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a> but are not prohibited by U.S. or other country organic standards.<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_certification"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a> Somewhat controversially, several organic food and seed companies promote and sell certified organic products that were developed using both chemical and nuclear mutagenesis. Several certified organic brands, whose companies support strict labeling or outright bans on GMO crops, market their use of branded wheat and other varietal strains which were derived from mutagenic processes without any reference to this genetic manipulation! </p><p><b>Plant breeding</b> is in simple terms the process of creating new open pollinated breeds (that are Hybrid in essence). It is an expanding phenomena that will soon replace many true heirloom  species; the new age breeders don't recognize the genetic  viability of wild and indigenous species and that the older the seed the more ecologically and nutritional viable it is.</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get!</h3><p>We are looking for $5300 in funding.

Jo Robinson shows how wild and heirloom varieties of plants pack more nutritional value than their domesticated varieties. 2. A way to maintain genetic diversity:  To keep many modern bred seeds viable over time, they are often back-crossed with wild strains. Why? Contained within the wild strain is the information/genetics for a plant to thrive - wild vigor. Indigenous/native/wild seeds are often progenitors of the many varieties we see today. As we lose the diversity in our seed stock its imperative to maintain the indigenous stock to replenish this diversity. 3. We want to put the power in your hands through seed saving: Rather than placing a seed in cold storage, with access mainly to plant breeders and institutional researchers. We believe seeds need to be in the hands of growers, growing, living, developing, multiplying and being saved each year; where their benefits can be experienced in real time, and not some future catastrophic time. Collectively we can rebuild the living vault. We encourage seed saving and provide learning opportunities and educational material to support the seed saver. 4. Cultural integrity  ""For us, seed holds a lot of knowledge. When we find the real seed from the elders, then we are able to bring back the original seed. When we bring back the original seed, we bring back all the cycles of life, which are recognized in our traditions. These traditions have held us together as a strong community since the beginning of time."" ~Mphatheleni Maukalule, Venda, South AfricaAlmost all cultures around the world have a binding relationship with seeds. The native Indians of America call themselves the ""people of the corn"" and have formed rituals and ceremonies around the planting, harvesting and saving of the corn seed. The Venda people of South Africa consider millet seed the most sacred seed s it connects them to Mupo, the Creation, the source of their lives, since when they were first created. It is an indigenous seed that is used in all of their spiritual ceremonies. Saving and growing indigenous seed is not only restorative for the body and ecology but also beneficial to cultures around the world as well.The threat to food security is not just from GMO'sThere are other ways corporations are affecting our food supply besides through GMO's; the varying ways are through:Genetic Engineering: GE inhibits seed development of a species which would otherwise pass down its genetic reproductive capability; this considerably compromises its nutritive  substance.The primary tropical fruits (pineapples, bananas, seedless grapes, seedless watermelon, seedless oranges, lemons, and grapefruits) eaten in America  are by-products of Genetic Engineering.Hybrids are varieties of the same species that are bred/crossed in order to create certain desired characteristics. They are called  F-1. Often times breeding compromises genetic expression, diversity, nutrition and seed saving. It is often unwittingly a process of removing valuable genetic material thus making a plant susceptible to disease and pathogens. However bred plants are more uniform in growth, production and appearance.Dehybridization occurs when a selected Hybrid offspring (f-1) becomes a stabilized open – pollinated cultivar; selecting the same offspring for 5 or more successive planting seasons in order to create desired characteristics at the compromise of genetic expression, diversity and nutrition. The end result is an open pollinatedhybrid created simply by a process of removing - breeding out valuable geneticmaterial thus making a plant susceptible to disease and pathogens. Most of theso-called Heirlooms are actually pseudo-heirlooms created through thisprocess of Dehybridization.Mutation Breeding is the process of exposing seeds to chemicals or radiation in order to generate mutants with desirable traits to be bred with other cultivars. Plants created using mutagenesis are sometimes called mutagenic plants or mutagenic seeds. From 1930–2007 more than 2540 mutagenic plant varieties have been released that have been derived either as direct mutants (70%) or from their progeny (30%).. Crop plants account for 75% of released mutagenic species.Unlike genetically modified crops, which typically involve the insertion of one or two target genes, plants developed via mutagenic processes with random, multiple and unspecific genetic changes have been discussed as a concern but are not prohibited by U.S. or other country organic standards. Somewhat controversially, several organic food and seed companies promote and sell certified organic products that were developed using both chemical and nuclear mutagenesis. Several certified organic brands, whose companies support strict labeling or outright bans on GMO crops, market their use of branded wheat and other varietal strains which were derived from mutagenic processes without any reference to this genetic manipulation! Plant breeding is in simple terms the process of creating new open pollinated breeds (that are Hybrid in essence). It is an expanding phenomena that will soon replace many true heirloom  species; the new age breeders don't recognize the genetic  viability of wild and indigenous species and that the older the seed the more ecologically and nutritional viable it is.What We Need & What You Get!We are looking for $5300 in funding. To continue purchasing seeds we have identified as wild or as close to wild as we  can get. We are looking for funding to also purchase additional seed saving, seed packaging and seed storing equipment. In return for your amazing support you get, yes seeds to grow! Indigenous, wild, pre-heirloom and select heirloom seeds to grow and benefit from and so much more!If we do not reach our goal, we will use the money we do raise, to purchase seed stock to grow outIf your giving enthusiasm helps us exceed our goal, we can pay to have additional help on the farm this year, and purchase additional seeds and equipment.We can make a difference, one seed saver at a time!One way to weaken the powers of big agriculture and their systematic encroachment of seed freedom, is to save your own seeds and grow your own food!We would like for growers to share the responsibility of ""preserving the past and planting the future"" by acquiring genetically viable seeds and saving those species whose environmental growing conditions are similar to your own. We encourage growers to acquire only viable seeds so as to eventually negate the growing of mutated species that compromise the genetic and nutritional substance in plants. We do not encourage the saving of pseudo-heirlooms - present day and recently bred species. We encourage the study of basic seed saving principles; and through our educational offerings you will obtain such knowledge.

Share, share and share!! And don't forget to share!Thank you and much gratitude to you all.

Despite the way it may appear on social media, no one on the team is a professional athlete.  No one gets paid to train or compete, in fact, it is quite expensive, even at the local level.  We are just regular people with day jobs that make time to train as best we can, and are mostly trying to make ends meet.  Competing as a group is something that we need to do to prove, without a doubt, that you do not need to eat animals to be strong and fit, but for many it will be impossible to acquire the funds to do so on their own.<br/></p><p>The costs of competing actually add up very quickly, especially when traveling to compete, which many members will be doing.  Competing, even locally, has many hidden costs such as your federation membership, entry fee, polygraph testing, and tanning.  Add to that the cost of flying in to get to the show and staying in a hotel as well as all of the costs of preparing for a show, such as a coach,  posing classes, and even your suit, and you are looking at anywhere from $1,500 to nearly $4,000 per competitor.  </p><p>Your donation will go largely to help cover these competitor costs.  It is imperative that the whole team competes together to have the largest impact and we have hand chosen some of the best vegan athletes around, and in order to be able to do this, we need to generate the funds to ensure that everyone can actually get to the show.  </p><p>As as non profit, the co-founders have been operating in the red, with no funding.  PlantBuilt’s expenses include printing out flyers, booth fees, running our website, and bookkeeping, to name a few.  If we continue on like this, PlantBuilt will no longer be able to continue and we will no longer be able to compete together as a team and have such a large impact for veganism.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Slowly, but surely, we are changing the stereotypes.  It is much more common to hear about athletes, even at a professional level, going vegan.  Veganism has grown leaps and bounds in the past decade, but we still have a long way to go to change the way the world treats animals.  We believe in a three-fold approach:</p><p>-Direct action to support animals at sanctuaries, rescues, and shelters.</p><p>-Outreach programs that teach people about the benefits of veganism and also expose the horrors of animals for profit businesses.  </p><p>-Living as a glowing example of healthy vegans.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you like what PlantBuilt is doing, feel free to follow us on <a href=""www.facebook.com/VeganOlympia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""www.facebook.com/veganolympia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/veganolympia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> , <a href=""www.twitter.com/PlantBuilt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""www.twitter.com/plantbuilt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.twitter.com/plantbuilt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter </a>, <a href=""www.instagram.com/PlantBuilt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""www.instagram.com/plantbuilt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/plantbuilt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instagram </a>  and check out our <a href=""www.plantbuilt.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""www.plantbuilt.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.plantbuilt.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.plantbuilt.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">competitor blog and other news at PlantBuilt.com</a></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>FAQ</h3><p><br/></p><p><b><b>When and where is PlantBuilt meeting up this year?</b><br/></b></p><p>We're glad you asked!

Competing as a group is something that we need to do to prove, without a doubt, that you do not need to eat animals to be strong and fit, but for many it will be impossible to acquire the funds to do so on their own.The costs of competing actually add up very quickly, especially when traveling to compete, which many members will be doing.  Competing, even locally, has many hidden costs such as your federation membership, entry fee, polygraph testing, and tanning.  Add to that the cost of flying in to get to the show and staying in a hotel as well as all of the costs of preparing for a show, such as a coach,  posing classes, and even your suit, and you are looking at anywhere from $1,500 to nearly $4,000 per competitor.  Your donation will go largely to help cover these competitor costs.  It is imperative that the whole team competes together to have the largest impact and we have hand chosen some of the best vegan athletes around, and in order to be able to do this, we need to generate the funds to ensure that everyone can actually get to the show.  As as non profit, the co-founders have been operating in the red, with no funding.  PlantBuilt’s expenses include printing out flyers, booth fees, running our website, and bookkeeping, to name a few.  If we continue on like this, PlantBuilt will no longer be able to continue and we will no longer be able to compete together as a team and have such a large impact for veganism.The ImpactSlowly, but surely, we are changing the stereotypes.  It is much more common to hear about athletes, even at a professional level, going vegan.  Veganism has grown leaps and bounds in the past decade, but we still have a long way to go to change the way the world treats animals.  We believe in a three-fold approach:-Direct action to support animals at sanctuaries, rescues, and shelters.-Outreach programs that teach people about the benefits of veganism and also expose the horrors of animals for profit businesses.  -Living as a glowing example of healthy vegans.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you like what PlantBuilt is doing, feel free to follow us on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram   and check out our competitor blog and other news at PlantBuilt.comFAQWhen and where is PlantBuilt meeting up this year?We're glad you asked!  PlantBuilt is checking in on July 23rd to the venue's hotel.  We have team workouts on the 24th and 25th and only those who have qualified to join us based on the perks, will be invited.  We will be at the Austin Convention Center on July 26th at the Naturally Fit Games.  We will be there from 10am - 10pm.  Anyone can come to the show as it's open to the public and tickets can be purchased at NaturallyFitGames.com  .  The after party will be on July 27th and that is also only open to those who qualify to join us based on the perk they chose.   We check out on July 28th.Can you tell me more about the after party?Sure!  We will be having an invite-only celebration where those who qualified to join will be able to meet, greet and hang out with us!  It will be catered and food will be provided from the following local establishments:  Burgers and more from BBQ Revolution ,  a build your own sundae bar from Sweet Ritual and deserts from Capital City Bakery .  We will also have music and activities.  I want to sign up to be an honorary team member.  When will my flight and travel arrangements be made?  Will there be transportation provided?That's awesome, we are so excited to host you and hang out together!  Once you have signed up to be an honorary team member, we will contact you within 24-72 hours so that we can work on your flight itinerary together and to start planning ahead.  We will also have a schedule of events for your stay with us from July 23-28th before you arrive.  Hotel arrangements will be made prior to check in.  You will receive valet shuttle service to and from the airport.  During our stay in Austin, we will be riding together as a team in passenger vans and transportation will be provided as well at no additional cost.  Basically, you will be invited and encouraged to hang out with us for the entire duration of our stay.  This includes but is not limited to: both team workout and photo shoots, preferred seating at the Naturally Fit Games, our after party, team trips for grocery shopping, and much more,  If you need to go anywhere within a 3 mile radius of the venue hotel, transportation can be provided from our venue hotel at no cost to you.  If you have any other questions please ask one of our team members by using the contact information provided on this page.  We will be answering more FAQs as they come up.  Thanks so much for your interest in PlantBuilt!",1.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings!  My name is Amanda Feterl and I am the elementary art teacher at Sibley East Public Schools in Arlington, Minnesota.  Our school district may be small, but technology has always played a big role in education of our students.  I am constantly seeking out new and exciting ways to engage my students in their quest to champion creativity!  </p>
<p>About a year ago, I was home on maternity leave and saw a news report on 3D printers for use at home and school.  Initially, this TV segment sparked my imagination as I began to dream up ways that I could incorporate a 3D printer in my classroom.  However, the outrageous price for the hardware, software, and ink cartridges made it an unrealistic and unrealized dream.  Until now...</p>
<p>Fast forward to present day!  Just a couple of weeks ago I stumbled on to Indiegogo's site while riffling through some Twitter messages.  I was surprised to read how crowd-funding helped to bring a 3D printer to a small community, just like Arlington!  </p>
<p>So, here I am!  Expressing the magnitude of what you, as a potential contributor, can help me achieve for the 650+ elementary students that I teach.  But your impact won't just be felt by the students!  Administrators, school board, parents and community members will surely know, see, and talk about the amazing technology opportunity their children have experienced in art class.  Just imagine a student's reaction to holding an actual 3 dimensional object (which they designed) and only existed on a computer screen just moments before.  Transformational!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $3,000 for the purchase of the following:</p>
<p>-Cubify Cube Printer ($1,299)</p>
<p>-Cubify Sculpt Software ($129)</p>
<p>-Cubify Ink Cartridges ($1,572)</p>
<p>The Cubify Cube Printer is currently the most kid-friendly 3D printer on the market because of its simplicity and the fact that there is no heat involved with the actual printing process.  Sculpt Software can be downloaded on to a computer or mobile device (our school has a 1:1 ipad initiative).  Obviously, there is a lot of cost with regards to the ink cartridges, however, I would like the opportunity to order all 18 colors that are available.  </p>
<p>One really cool aspect of the 3D printer is that it can be used to help generate income.  For example, necklaces and bracelets can be designed, printed and sold for a profit.  My hope is that over time, the money generated will pay for the purchasing of additional cartridges.  </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>No doubt, this will be an unforgettable adventure for my students as they dream, design, and create their way through 21st century learning!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I want to thank you personally for taking the time to read my campaign!  I really appreciate it!  If you are unable to contribute at this time, please consider helping me spread the word my project.  Indiegogo has fantastic sharing tools available for you to do this.  All my best!  ~Amanda</p></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Liz and I have been involved in international sport for some time now, both at the representative, and recreational levels. I have an unstoppable passion for sport, and believe that it is one of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal. In February, I will be embarking on a 5 month journey through 10 African countries, and 22 schools and communities to work towards tackling 3 of the 8 UN development goals through rugby. These include: promoting gender equality and empowering women, combating HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases, and developing a global partnership for development. The objective is not just to go in, give money, or a bit of time, and then leave them with a distant memory and not much else. The project is designed such that we give leaders and members of the community the tools and knowledge of how to continue what we've started after we've left, and to empower individuals to carry out those projects. </p>
<p>In order to make this mission happen, it is going to take a considerable amount of funds...which is why I've started this campaign! By contributing to this project, you will personally change not one, but any number of people's lives, both children and adults. ALL FUNDS RAISED GO DIRECTLY TO THE PROJECT. There is no middle man, no commission to anyone for handling money, literally everything goes to funding the project. <b><i>This is an Officially registered charity, and you can absolutely get tax receipts for it! </i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Goal: £8,700.</b> The project is carried out in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa over 5 months. The funding for the project goes towards preparing educational material and bringing in educators to talk about HIV/AIDS and the prevention of communicable diseases; the second part of the funding goes towards the equipment and venue costs for hosting the rugby sessions with the children, coaches, and community leaders, as well as the food they are provided during those days. The last part of the funding goes towards the logistics of the trip, and transport between cities/countries and lodging over the course of 5 months.</li>
<li>This project has been running for 3 years now, and has had a profound impact to-date. We run alongside and support NGOs, national rugby unions, government departments, and schools to ensure we spread our roots as much as possible. </li>
<li>As much as I endeavour to reach my entire goal, if I am not able to, <b>all funds raised will go to the project </b>and the remainder will come out of pocket. This is something I feel incredibly strongly about and the impact our work will have, as well as the lessons we will learn from them is not lost on me.  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Health Education: Partnering with G4S, we teach local school children about prevention of communicable diseases, something that is a very real problem to them in their lives and invaluable information. </li>
<li>Gender Equality and Empowerment: Both boys and girls are involved in the project, teaching respect, and gender equality. We also aim to empower both kids and teachers and communities members to lead and be confident in what they do. </li>
<li>Development: The final, and perhaps one of the greatest impacts the project has is in development. With increased leadership, empowerment, and happiness, the community members gain motivation towards working together in the future. </li>
<li>This project is in its third year, and has already built up a strong network of schools and community partners so far. As a result, those schools have had their headteachers take on coaching roles, and having some sort of rugby during the year, in preparation for next year's project. This just shows that the way the project is being delivered is accomplishing its goals by encouraging development. </li>

<p><b>What is the Rancing Revolution?</b></p>
<p>It is the project of <a href=""http://www.rancingrevolution.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rancing Revolution</a> to inspire, facilitate and advance conversations on the topic of bullying, and to do so in a way that not only discourages bullying behavior but also simultaneously encourages its positive counterparts - freedom of expression, acceptance of diversity, social support and overall health and well-being. </p>
<p>Our three-pronged approach - through Youth Education, Adult Education and Social Activism- frames the issue of bullying in the language of oppression and addresses both bullying behavior and lateral violence in a systems-perspective approach to this social problem.  Our solution-focused mission is to eliminate bullying behavior from all levels of our society by inspiring and sustaining active cultures of Kindness.</p>
<p>Using macro-level theory based in critical social construction and oppression theory, as well as normative campaign strategy, the multi-part educational curriculum addresses bullying behavior in relation to the following themes:</p>
<ul>
<li> Power, privilege and oppression</li>
<li> Culture and norms </li>
<li> Difference and diversity</li>
<li> Computer-mediated communication  </li>
<li> Fear</li>
<li> Shame and vulnerability  </li>
</ul>
<p>Our programming strives to cultivate counter-cultures emphasizing the primary values of empathy, authenticity and social support. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Why we need your support!</b></p>
<p>This year, with the support of an Americorps VISTA grant, Rancing Revolution is partnering with the University of Vermont and the Dewey House for Civic Engagement to implement a collaborative program that partners college student mentors with local schools and youth organizations to support the implementation and facilitation of Rancing Revolution programming.  But to really get this program off the ground, we need your help!! </p>
<p>Your financial contribution would help support:</p>
<ul>
<li>The finalization of curriculum development</li>
<li>The printing and distribution of educational materials</li>
<li>The training of facilitators</li>
<li>The costs of transportation and facilitation</li>
<li>The cultivation of future partnerships, collaborations and outreach</li>
</ul>
<p>The potential and growth of this program depends largely on this support!  Join the Revolution and take an active role in inspiring, creating and sustaining positive social change!  </p>

<p>“It’s okay to be different and people need to understand that. And people need to be kinder to each other – I have been trying to just to say ‘hi’ to more people in the halls and talk to different people than I normally do” – Allie, u32 middle school student</p>
<p>“Every person needs to change their mindset, one at a time” –Emily, u32 middle school student</p>
<p>“Rancing puts you in an uncomfortable situation to make you realize every single day people are judged, evaluated, ridiculed and mocked for simply expressing themselves.It really made me look at how we as a culture view difference.” –Alec, UVM SW student</p>
<p>“The act of Rancing can be a reminder that we are not alone in our struggles and that every person has joy inside of them that they can share.” –Amy, UVM SW student</p>
<p>“Rancing definitely made me feel empathetic towards those who don’t necessarily fit into the ‘norms’ of society, whether it’s their actions, their looks, or their identity that makes them feel excluded.” – Jasmine, UVM SW student</p>
<p>“I’ve always thought bullying was for middle school kids but you made me think about it and realize it happens even with adults. I would like to join and participate to help bring about change and a shift in thinking! I feel like this workshop was the highlight of my nursing career.”  -- Stephanie, UVM Nursing student</p>

<p>""My name is Corey Richardson and I am a co-founder and Director of Rancing Revolution. I also teach social work part-time at the University of Vermont, coach youth soccer and am working on my Doctoral degree (dissertation on the topic of Bullying) through Tilburg University in the Netherlands. For me, Rancing Revolution is a labor of love. I have donated thousands of dollars and a year and a half of my life getting this project off the ground. I have done this because I am passionate about social change, about the true power and courage of Kindness, and about the possibility of paradigm-shifting social work revolutionizing the way we look at Bullying and other social problems. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, 'Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.' I believe that, and it is that notion which guides this work.""</p>

<p>“My name is Kailee Brickner-Mcdonald, director of the Dewey House for Civic Engagement at UVM. Rancing Revolution brings together two of my favorite things -- playing and making positive social change. Rancing started as simply a fun thing to do with friends when I was a student at the College of William and Mary. Now, to be able to work with the activity of Rancing as a metaphor and learning experience is amazing! I've worked with students who want to change the world since 2007-- in museum education, as a campus organizer for public interest campaigns, and most recently as Director of the Dewey House. Some of my most meaningful experiences include being one of the lead facilitators for UVM's Next Step Social Justice Retreat, developing the Dewey House curricula for service-learning courses, and seeing the constant growth and learning which students inspire in my own life.”</p>

I've had the opportunity to work with many non-profit organizations both local and abroad, which ultimately led me to Rancing Revolution in my final year of university.

It is the project of Rancing Revolution to inspire, facilitate and advance conversations on the topic of bullying, and to do so in a way that not only discourages bullying behavior but also simultaneously encourages its positive counterparts - freedom of expression, acceptance of diversity, social support and overall health and well-being. 
Our three-pronged approach - through Youth Education, Adult Education and Social Activism- frames the issue of bullying in the language of oppression and addresses both bullying behavior and lateral violence in a systems-perspective approach to this social problem.  Our solution-focused mission is to eliminate bullying behavior from all levels of our society by inspiring and sustaining active cultures of Kindness.
Using macro-level theory based in critical social construction and oppression theory, as well as normative campaign strategy, the multi-part educational curriculum addresses bullying behavior in relation to the following themes:

 Power, privilege and oppression
 Culture and norms 
 Difference and diversity
 Computer-mediated communication  
 Fear
 Shame and vulnerability  

Our programming strives to cultivate counter-cultures emphasizing the primary values of empathy, authenticity and social support. 



Why we need your support!
This year, with the support of an Americorps VISTA grant, Rancing Revolution is partnering with the University of Vermont and the Dewey House for Civic Engagement to implement a collaborative program that partners college student mentors with local schools and youth organizations to support the implementation and facilitation of Rancing Revolution programming.  But to really get this program off the ground, we need your help!! 
Your financial contribution would help support:

The finalization of curriculum development
The printing and distribution of educational materials
The training of facilitators
The costs of transportation and facilitation
The cultivation of future partnerships, collaborations and outreach

The potential and growth of this program depends largely on this support!  Join the Revolution and take an active role in inspiring, creating and sustaining positive social change!  
What folks are saying about Rancing Revolution programs so far:
We're gaining recognition for our work outside the classroom as well! Check out the ""In the News"" section of our website to see clips on Channel 3, Channel 5 and a video by the Burlington Free Press.


“It’s okay to be different and people need to understand that. And people need to be kinder to each other – I have been trying to just to say ‘hi’ to more people in the halls and talk to different people than I normally do” – Allie, u32 middle school student
“Every person needs to change their mindset, one at a time” –Emily, u32 middle school student
“Rancing puts you in an uncomfortable situation to make you realize every single day people are judged, evaluated, ridiculed and mocked for simply expressing themselves.It really made me look at how we as a culture view difference.” –Alec, UVM SW student
“The act of Rancing can be a reminder that we are not alone in our struggles and that every person has joy inside of them that they can share.” –Amy, UVM SW student
“Rancing definitely made me feel empathetic towards those who don’t necessarily fit into the ‘norms’ of society, whether it’s their actions, their looks, or their identity that makes them feel excluded.” – Jasmine, UVM SW student
“I’ve always thought bullying was for middle school kids but you made me think about it and realize it happens even with adults. I would like to join and participate to help bring about change and a shift in thinking! I feel like this workshop was the highlight of my nursing career.”  -- Stephanie, UVM Nursing student
Meet the Team!




""My name is Corey Richardson and I am a co-founder and Director of Rancing Revolution. I also teach social work part-time at the University of Vermont, coach youth soccer and am working on my Doctoral degree (dissertation on the topic of Bullying) through Tilburg University in the Netherlands. For me, Rancing Revolution is a labor of love. I have donated thousands of dollars and a year and a half of my life getting this project off the ground. I have done this because I am passionate about social change, about the true power and courage of Kindness, and about the possibility of paradigm-shifting social work revolutionizing the way we look at Bullying and other social problems. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, 'Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.' I believe that, and it is that notion which guides this work.""




“My name is Kailee Brickner-Mcdonald, director of the Dewey House for Civic Engagement at UVM. Rancing Revolution brings together two of my favorite things -- playing and making positive social change. Rancing started as simply a fun thing to do with friends when I was a student at the College of William and Mary. Now, to be able to work with the activity of Rancing as a metaphor and learning experience is amazing! I've worked with students who want to change the world since 2007-- in museum education, as a campus organizer for public interest campaigns, and most recently as Director of the Dewey House. Some of my most meaningful experiences include being one of the lead facilitators for UVM's Next Step Social Justice Retreat, developing the Dewey House curricula for service-learning courses, and seeing the constant growth and learning which students inspire in my own life.”




""My name is Marie Hebert and I am a recent UVM graduate in Community Development and Applied Economics. I've had the opportunity to work with many non-profit organizations both local and abroad, which ultimately led me to Rancing Revolution in my final year of university. With such a fun, positive way to go about bullying prevention, I was immediately hooked. I am very much looking forward to further spreading Rancing Revolution's message as an AmeriCorps VISTA this year.""

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>My name is Kristien Van Vlasselaer and I am a third year PhD candidate at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY.  I moved here from Woodside, CA to follow my educational dreams, explore the east coast and most importantly learn, learn, LEARN!</div>
<div>Academic sciences are experiencing major budget cuts across the board and my lab is no exception.  However, my situation is unique in that the Biology Department which agreed to fund me underestimated how successful (and therefore expensive) my project would be and I find myself without money until July 2014.  </div>
<div>I am asking for any contribution, great or small, which will allow me to continue to pursue my cell migration project and thus graduate from RPI next year so I can go out into the real world and start making a difference! </div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is $2,500 which is a gross underestimate of what I really need to finish my degree.  If you're wondering how much multiply that by ten...and then double it.  This science stuff is both financially and intellectually draining!  Contributions to my project will go toward my last two years of doctoral research.  I am working on figuring out the mechanisms that make astrocytes, cells which help the neurons in your brain and spinal column, migrate and move.  This research is critical to creating therapeutics for spinal column damage and paralysis as well as for combating astrocytomas which are currently the most common type of brain cancer. My research can only continue if my cells are growing and I can purchase the things I need to both collect and then analyze my data!</p>
<p>If you contribute to my project I am willing to share unique parts of my graduate student life with you.  The following are some of the fabulous perks I am offering:</p>
<p>- A picture of me totally stoked to be in the lab when I receive your donation!</p>
<p>- An in depth, over the top explanation of my project in such detail that you will understand my project and also grow to hate the words ""guanine nuclear exchange factor"", ""GTPase"" and ""astrocyte migratory potential"" because I won't be able to stop talking your ear off!</p>
<p>- A copy of scientific articles or review articles I am able to write due to your donation!</p>
<p>- An invitation to my PhD defense (Coming live to an auditorium in Troy, NY SPRING 2014)!</p>
<p>- A radiantly joyful picture of myself at said PhD defense upon hearing that I passed and am now a DOCTOR!</p>
<p>- A huge, thankful hug next time I see you in person and a heartfelt thank you for helping me to accomplish my dream!  </p>
<p>- And many more that I haven't thought of yet...</p>
<p>As I said below, $2,500 isn't nearly what I need to finish this project and I hope to be able to raise much more.  However, any money that does get donated to this worthy, fabulous cause will go toward purchasing cell culture materials, antibodies for cell staining and analysis, chemicals for buffers, test tubes, carbon dioxide tanks and a whole assortment of things necessary to keep a cell biology lab going strong.  Believe me, no donation is too small!</p>

<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Like I mentioned before, my research into astrocytes has long term implications in spinal cord and brain trauma as well as in astrocytoma cancer research.  Astrocytes function in a variety of roles but the simplest way to describe them is as cells which support your neurons structurally and chemically and also react to trauma.  Although I'm using astrocytes as my cellular model, I'm truly interested in the GTPases, known as molecular switches, and their regulators, guanine nuclear exchange factors (GEFs), which are responsible for cell movement.  Although GTPases are well understood, the proteins that regulate them are not and neither GTPases nor GEFs are well characterized in astrocytes.  My research increases both short term basic biological understanding as well as long term possibilities for spinal damage and brain cancer therapies.  Just like letters make words which make sentences and paragraphs that change the world, academic research increases basic understanding which grows and grows to eventually lead to cures  that make people's lives longer and better.  </p>
<p>Once I finish my PhD I plan on pursuing post doctoral study aimed to make me an even better (and nerdier) scientist.  After the post doc I hope to work in the biotechnology industry working on creating new and innovative therapeutics which help people feel and live better.</p>
<p>I could go on about the impact of my work or academic research in general at length and would be happy to do so if you are at all interested but I'll stop here for now.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute I completely understand and thank you for reading about my project anyway.  However, if you could forward my plight across the interwebs (facebook, email, reddit, or tell whoever is sitting next to you on the bus) I'm much more likely to meet and hopefully exceed my goal.  The perks I offer are always up for negotiation and I'd love to explain what I do to anyone that's interested.  Please, please, please help me to finish this degree so I can go on to work in biotechnology and make people's lives better!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In May of 2013, after a two year battle with depression, I nearly lost.  Instead, I chose to remove myself from my life in a different way - by creating a new one.  I left everything: my job, my partner, even my belongings.  I packed myself, my dog, and my poetry books in my car and drove to my dad's house to plan what would come next in life for me.</p>
<p>I had lived in Taiwan briefly before, and leaving it had been difficult.  I knew I could go back and easily find work, and I knew I had been happy there.  After two years of sadness, I've decided to claim my own happiness.  No one is going to make me happy for me.  I'm doing this for myself - one of the first things I've done for myself in a long time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The one way plane ticket alone ran me $922.  I was able to use some frequent flier miles to bring the price down by $200, but I still need to prepare my first month's rent as well as some preliminary cost-of-living type stuff until my first paycheck comes in - and I'm still out $800 from moving away from Arizona.  That's a long story, but the short version is gas is expensive and the help I had been counting on disappeared.<br/><br/>As you can see, Just the plane ticket and moving away from Arizona have already cost me far more than the low goal I've set for this fundraiser, and that's before figuring the money I need for startup in Taiwan.  But I've set this goal low hoping to meet it at least, while any overage will obviously be necessary and helpful.  By my estimates, $1541 will reimburse me for the plane ticket and the move out of AZ, and another grand will be sufficient startup in Taiwan.  $2541, then, would set me square and anything over that could allow me to go to Boston to have one last interaction with the national slam poetry community at the National Poetry Slam before I go.</p>
<p>What you get is - I mean good kharma obviously ;)  But you also get some original art made just by me!  I've been a performance poet for half my life now and this art has saved me many times over.  So I'd like to share my poetry with you and potentially even some horrible-but-hilarious visual art!  You get knowing that you helped someone create a better life for themself.  You get my undying gratitude, a cool postcard from the other side of the globe, and if you ever want to visit Taiwan, you can stay with me for free while you visit!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This isn't some crazy whim.  I mean it kindof is, but also I've lived abroad before and I've lived in Taiwan before.  So I'm not going into this blind and unexperienced.  I'm committed, through contract, to living in Taiwan for at least two years and teaching English while I'm there.  The money I make while working there will mostly be going to pay off my student loans, as the cost of living is not high.  This is a responsible decision to be making, it just happens to entail moving to the opposite side of the globe.</p>
<p>This will also prepare me for a much brighter future.  With two years of experience as a teacher, and learning a third language, my future options will blow wide open!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe you are not a rich person.  That's perfectly understandable - shucks, I'm the one trying to raise money on the internet, right?  But you can still help by spreading the word, and leaving messages of support.  Know that I appreciate just the knowledge that you believe in me!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi all! My name is Taylor Ferguson, I am a twenty year old college student studying Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut. This past fall I was accepted to study abroad in the amazing country of South Africa through a program called African Field Ecology and Renewable Resources Management. This program includes a lecture portion, in which I am currently enrolled, and a field portion, which will be taking place for three weeks in August 2012 at the Entabeni Nature Guide Training Reserve in Limpopo, South Africa. During my time there I will be learning the fundamentals of field ecology, getting trained in First Aid and Track &amp; Sign, learning how to perform a necropsy, studying the amazing flora and fauna of South Africa, learning about South African culture, visiting and donating my time to a school of underprivileged children, potentially doing research for a senior thesis, and overall shaping myself as a global citizen! This will be my first time travelling abroad, as previously I have not had the financial funds to have such an experience.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The trip will cost about $5,500 total (this includes airfaire both ways, accomodations, etc.), but I am only hoping to raise a total of $2000. The money raised will be going directly to the cost of my trip, which is paid for through the University's fee bill system.</p>
<p>However, I don't want money without doing work! My campaign involves my participation in a 5K race taking place on April 22, 2012 called the ENOUGH!

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi all! My name is Taylor Ferguson, I am a twenty year old college student studying Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut. This past fall I was accepted to study abroad in the amazing country of South Africa through a program called African Field Ecology and Renewable Resources Management. This program includes a lecture portion, in which I am currently enrolled, and a field portion, which will be taking place for three weeks in August 2012 at the Entabeni Nature Guide Training Reserve in Limpopo, South Africa. During my time there I will be learning the fundamentals of field ecology, getting trained in First Aid and Track & Sign, learning how to perform a necropsy, studying the amazing flora and fauna of South Africa, learning about South African culture, visiting and donating my time to a school of underprivileged children, potentially doing research for a senior thesis, and overall shaping myself as a global citizen! This will be my first time travelling abroad, as previously I have not had the financial funds to have such an experience.


The trip will cost about $5,500 total (this includes airfaire both ways, accomodations, etc.), but I am only hoping to raise a total of $2000. The money raised will be going directly to the cost of my trip, which is paid for through the University's fee bill system.
However, I don't want money without doing work! My campaign involves my participation in a 5K race taking place on April 22, 2012 called the ENOUGH! Race to end Violence hosted by the Sexual Assault Crisis Service in partnership with the Hartford Marathon Foundation and Central Connecticut State University. For every donation I receive per person I will donate an additional dollar towards the ENOUGH! fund (in addition to the money I pay to enter the race). Thus, by supporting me in my travel and education you will be simultaneously supporting this wonderful cause and overall, a chance to improve the quality of life both here and overseas.

Also, if you are looking for further incentive, supporting the Sexual Assult Crisis Service with your donation helps not only spread awareness about issues of violence here in our backyard but also helps to cease that violence once and for all.

If you support the arts, you know the importance of generating dialogue and collaboration across disciplines. The unique, community-driven spirit of Word Up encourages exactly that. </span>

Word Up has hosted events and workshops targeted to our younger neighbors in order to engage the nearly 54,000 residents under the age of 18 in Nothern Manhattan. In fact, young people make up 25% of our neighborhood. At a time when the city is facing more cuts to after-school budgets, community-supported youth programs—like Word Up’s teen writing and theater program developed in collaboration with People’s Theatre Project—are especially crucial.<br/></span></p>

In New York City, there are too-big-to-fail banks and big-name pharmacies on every corner, because smaller businesses and creative organizations can’t keep up with rising rent prices. We want to prove the value of open, creative spaces in our neighborhood by reopening Word Up and making it more vibrant than ever.</span></h2>

<h3>Ayude a la Librería Comunitaria Word Up a mudarse a su nuevo hogar.<br/> <br/> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Librería Comunitaria Word Up—</span><strong>la única libreria comunitaria y espacio artístico en Washington Heights, ciudad de Nueva York,  propulsada por voluntarios solamente—necesita su ayuda para poder continuar siendo una fuente viable para la comunidad.  Después de más de un año de servir al Norte de Manhattan, nuestro contrato de alquiler mensual en 4157 Broadway se terminó el 31 de Agosto de 2012. Ayúdenos a abrir un local nuevo, para que así podamos continuar fomentando un ambiente positivo para la lectura y la escritura, el arte y la educación en el Norte de Manhattan.</strong>
</h3>
<h3>
<br/> Word Up es un proyecto de Seven Stories Institute, una organización 501(c)(3) sin fines de lucro, de manera que su donación es deducible para efectos impositivos.</h3>
<h2> <br/> Por qué?<br/> <br/> Es simple: nuestro barrio—y todo barrio—necesita un espacio para poder compartir y crear, donde las personas de todo origen, edad y capacidad puedan participar en su comunidad. Word Up ha sido ese espacio para muchos residentes del Norte de Manhattan y para visitas provenientes de otros lugares también. Es verdaderamente un espacio creado para la comunidad, por la comunidad.</h2>
<h3> <br/> Nuestro objetivo es recaudar más de $60,000 para poder así continuar la importante tarea de promover la escritura y la lectura, las artes, y la conciencia social en uno de los distritos más densamente poblados en Manhattan, con la esperanza de inspirar proyectos semejantes en todo Nueva York, en los Estados Unidos, y en el mundo entero.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Qué es Word Up?</strong></h2>
<h2>Word Up abrió sus puertas el 17 de junio de 2011 como una librería que aparece espontáneamente (un “pop-up shop”), con la intención de participar durante un mes en el Uptown Arts Stroll—un festival que se realiza todos los años en el mes de junio en todo el barrio para celebrar artistas locales en el norte de Manhattan.</h2>
<h3>
<br/> Lo que sucedió en los días siguientes sobrepasó todo lo esperado. Gente—toda clase de gente! desde los más jóvenes hasta los más viejos, residentes nuevos y veteranos, lectores y no-aun-lectores—pasaron rápidamente con gran entusiasmo, y luego permanecieron para formar parte de este cuento curioso que estaba siendo escrito en la historia de esta comunidad. <br/> <br/> Los vecinos expresaron variaciones sobre el mismo tema: Nosotros te necesitamos aquí! Se sintieron bienvenidos y se comprometieron más. El frente colorido de nuestro local, en una cuadra donde varios locales están desocupados, se convirtió en un paraíso para aquellos seres de pensamiento libre y para el diálogo verdadero.</h3>
<h3>
<br/> Desde el primer día, los visitantes comenzaron a hacernos muchas preguntas, pero la más frecuente fue “Es posible que ustedes se queden aquí?” Esta pregunta fue repetida tantas veces que finalmente se convirtió en una declaración: “POR FAVOR QUEDENSE.”<br/> <br/> Y así fue que nos quedamos.  Gracias a la ayuda de Northern Manhattan Arts Alliance (NoMAA), Seven Stories Institute, y el trabajo de más de 100 voluntarios, Word Up prosperó durante más de un año en 4157 Broadway hasta que los nuevos propietarios del edificio terminaron el contrato de alquiler mensual. A pesar que por el momento no tiene un hogar, Word Up permanece activo en eventos comunitarios, promoviendo la lectura y escritura y las artes en el norte de Manhattan y en la ciudad de Nueva York en general.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>Cómo es el barrio?</h2>
<h3>Washington Heights es un barrio diverso étnicamente y económicamente, situado en el norte de Manhattan en la ciudad de Nueva York.</h3>
<h3>De manera semejante a otros tantos barrios en la Ciudad de Nueva York, Washington Heights es un cruce de varias culturas donde valores y tradiciones diferentes se encuentran, y donde las ideas de muchos grupos de inmigrantes obran recíprocamente. Muchos residentes de Washington Heights tienen sus raíces en la República Dominicana, por lo cual es posible que usted haya escuchado referirse a Washington Heights como a “Quisqueya Heights” o “El Alto.” Las generaciones anteriores captaron el nombre de “Frankfurt sobre el Hudson” o “Moscú sobre el Hudson” debido a las grandes cantidades de residentes Judíos con raíces en Europa Central y Oriental y Rusia. También existen residentes de origen griego e irlandés diseminados por el barrio entero.</h3>
<h3>Español, inglés y ruso son los idiomas que escuchará más frecuentemente caminando por Broadway, y estos tres idiomas están representados en Word Up. Además de su diversidad asombrosa, nuestro barrio es el segundo distrito más poblado en Manhattan, y tenemos la mayor concentración de niños en el distrito. Word Up sirve a nuestros vecinos de diferentes orígenes, de todas las edades.</h3>
<h2> </h2>
<h3>Por qué usted debe ayudar a Word Up a abrir un local permanente en Washington Heights, NYC?<br/> <br/> USTED EXTRAŇA A WORD UP! Tal vez usted lo vio hablar a Junot Díaz en nuestro escenario, o participó en el <em>Immigration Circus</em> del People’s Theatre Project, o bailó bachata con su enamorado en el Festival de la Música en Washington Heights, o le ayudó a su niño a encontrar un libro fabuloso escrito por su autor favorito en nuestros estantes, o tal vez usted solamente tuvo una conversación estimulante con un vecino. Nosotros lo extrañamos a usted también! <br/> <br/> USTED AMA A LOS LIBROS Y A LAS LIBRERIAS. Nosotros también. El equipo de Word Up, compuesto de voluntarios únicamente, trabaja infatigablemente para conservar a los libros y al diálogo que ellos generan, como parte de la comunidad. Más aún, hemos hecho nuestros cálculos: por cada dólar donado a Word Up, un libro más es distribuido a la comunidad del norte de Manhattan.</h3>
<h3> <br/> USTED APOYA A LAS ARTES. Word Up es una estación en el norte de la ciudad para la comunidad literaria, así como también la base del hogar para los artistas locales y las organizaciones artísticas. Previamente a la existencia de Word Up, la gente creativa en Washington Heights no tenía muchas oportunidades para leer sus poesías, exhibir su arte, presentar sus obras de teatro, o conducir un taller de caligrafía, todo bajo un mismo techo. Si usted apoya a los artes, usted reconoce la importancia  de generar el diálogo y la colaboración entre las diferentes disciplinas.     Eso es precisamente lo que fomenta el espíritu único de Word Up, dirigido hacia la comunidad.</h3>
<h3>USTED APOYA ORGANIZACIONES COMUNITARIAS. Word Up es un espacio creativo para la comunidad, por la comunidad. Aún sin tener un local físico, el colectivo de voluntarios de Word Up conserva su presencia en muchos eventos de la comunidad y de la ciudad, incluyendo el Little Red Lighthouse Festival, la Young Urban Moms Conference, el Inwood Greenmarket, la inauguración del United Palace of Cultural Arts, y muchos más!</h3>
<h3>USTED APOYA PROGRAMAS PARA LA JUVENTUD. Word ha hospedado eventos y talleres dedicados a nuestros residentes más jóvenes a fin de atraer acerca de 54,000 residentes menores de 18 años en el norte de Manhattan. En realidad, los jóvenes constituyen el 25% de nuestro barrio. En tiempos como éstos en que el presupuesto de los programas para la juventud fuera de las escuelas es reducido, los programas apoyados por la comunidad—tales como el  programa de Word Up de escritores adolescentes y de teatro desarrollado en colaboración con People’s Theatre Project—son crucialmente importantes.</h3>
<h3>USTED CREE QUE LOS ESPACIOS CREATIVOS SON TAN IMPORTANTES COMO LOS GENERADORES DE GANANCIAS EN CUALQUIER BARRIO, EN CUALQUIER SITIO. En la ciudad de Nueva York, existen bancos y farmacias poderosos en cada esquina debido a que los comercios más pequeños y las organizaciones creativas no pueden pagar los alquileres que van aumentando. Queremos demostrar el valor de los espacios creativos en nuestra comunidad abriendo una vez más Word Up y convirtiéndolo en un centro mas vibrante que nunca.</h3>
<h2> </h2>
<h3>Usted sabía?<br/> <br/> Desde junio  2011, Word Up ha:<br/> <br/> DISTRIBUIDO más de 30,000 libros en inglés, español, y ruso a nuestros vecinos, muchos de ellos por $1 solamente.<br/> <br/> PRESENTADO a más de 1,200 artistas en nuestro escenario incluyendo al autor Junot Díaz ganador del Premio Pulitzer, el artista radical de libros cómicos Seth Tobocman, el poeta Meena Alexander, el comediante Tom Shillue, la fotógrafa Arlene Gottfried, artistas sin hogar en el pasado y en el presente Concrete Justice, la narradora de cuentos Michele Carlo, el cantante popular Ed Askew, la leyenda local del jazz Marjorie Eliot, así como los talentos literarios y musicales de nuestros vecinos. <br/> <br/> PROVEIDO un espacio abierto para programas fuera de las escuelas, talleres, reuniones comunitarias, e intercambio de idiomas para nuestros vecinos.  </h3>
<h3>APOYADO a autores, artistas, y pequeñas prensas independientes.<br/> <br/> COLABORADO con muchas organizaciones creativas y negocios pequeños tal como Uptown Collective, United Palace of Cultural Arts, Fresh Press/Fresh Youth Initiatives, Young Urban Moms, Seven Stories Press, Washington Heights Free Radio, Planned Parenthood, World War 3 Illustrated, y muchos más.<br/> <br/> OPERADO gracias a un equipo de más de 100 voluntarios, 7 días por semana, durante más de un año.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>
<strong>El capítulo próximo:</strong><br/> Nosotros estamos buscando activamente un nuevo local en Washington Heights. Cada semana la comisión encargada de encontrar una propiedad para Word Up presenta un informe con fotografías e información relevante sobre locales potenciales. Lo examinamos. Deliberamos. Obtenemos estimaciones del costo de arreglos y construcción. Es un proceso lento.<br/> <br/> Hasta que encontremos un local que satisface las necesidades de nuestra comunidad de la mejor manera posible, usted puede encontrar el colectivo de voluntarios de Word Up en los eventos comunitarios alrededor de Washington Heights. Fíjese en nuestra página de web dónde tendrá lugar el próximo evento!</h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Otras formas de participar:</strong></p>
<h3>SIRVA COMO VOLUNTARIO. El colectivo de voluntarios de Word Up necesitará su ayuda después que abramos las puertas. Verifique en nuestra página de web de qué manera usted puede participar. Aún si usted no vive en Washington Heights, esperamos que Word Up le sirve como inspiración para comenzar una iniciativa semejante en su barrio. Debido a la presencia permanente de grandes empresas en nuestras vidas, necesitamos reafirmar la importancia de las conversaciones en nuestras comunidades. No es fácil, pero confíenos: vale la pena todo el trabajo invertido!</h3>
<h3> <br/> ANUNCIE NUESTRO INDIEGOGO URL EN SU PAGINA DE WEB O BLOG. Si ha llegado hasta aquí, debe ser porque  a usted Word Up le interesa tanto como al resto del colectivo de voluntarios. Indiegogo facilita considerablemente compartir nuestra historia. Ayúdenos y disemine las noticias sobre Word Up! <br/> <br/> Gracias por su ayuda! Esperamos verlo cuando abramos las puertas por segunda vez!</h3>

Help Word Up Community Bookshop/Librería Comunitaria move to a new home.Word Up Community Bookshop—the only 100% volunteer-powered, community bookshop and arts space in Washington Heights, New York City—needs your help to remain a viable community resource for our neighbors. After more than a year serving Northern Manhattan, our month-to-month lease at 4157 Broadway was terminated August 31, 2012. Help us open a new location, so we can continue fostering a positive environment for literacy, arts, and education in Northern Manhattan.Word Up is a project of Seven Stories Institute, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, so your donation is tax-deductible. Why?It’s simple: our neighborhood—and every neighborhood—needs space to share and create, where people of all backgrounds, ages, and abilities can participate in their community. Word Up has been that space for so many residents of Northern Manhattan and visitors from all over the place. It is truly a space made for the community, by the community.Our goal is to raise $60,000+ so we can continue the important work of promoting literacy, the arts, and social awareness in one of the most densely populated districts in Manhattan, and hopefully inspire similar projects all over New York City, the United States, and the world.


What is Word Up?

Intended as a 1-month-long pop-up bookshop during the 2011 Uptown Arts Stroll—a neighborhood-wide festival every June celebrating local artists with events around Northern Manhattan—Word Up opened its doors June 17, 2011. What happened in the following days was beyond all expectation. People—all kinds of people! from the very young to the very old, longtime residents and newcomers, readers and not-yet-readers—cycled through with enthusiasm, then stayed a while to let themselves become a part of the curious story that was being written into the history of our neighborhood. Neighbors expressed a variation of the same theme: We need you here! They felt welcome and became more involved. Our colorful storefront, on a block with many vacant storefronts, became a haven for open minds and real dialogue.On the very first day, visitors began asking us many things, but the one we heard most was ""Can you please stay?"" It was repeated so frequently, it turned into a declaration: ""PLEASE STAY.""So, we stayed. With the help of Northern Manhattan Arts Alliance (NoMAA), Seven Stories Institute, and the work of 100+ volunteers Word Up thrived for over a year at 4157 Broadway until the month-to-month lease was terminated by the building’s new owners. Although temporarily homeless, Word Up is still active at community events, promoting literacy and the arts around Northern Manhattan and New York City at large.


Junot Díaz talking about the importance of Word Up AT WORD UP on June 7th, 2012
What’s the neighborhood like?
Washington Heights is an ethnically and economically diverse historical neighborhood located in Northern Manhattan, New York City.

Like many neighborhoods in New York City, Washington Heights is a multicultural crossroads where the different values, traditions, and ideas of many immigrant groups interact. Many residents of the Heights have roots in the Dominican Republic, which is why you may have heard Washington Heights referred to as “Quisqueya Heights” or “El Alto.” Prior generations earned  the neighborhood names like “Frankfurt on the Hudson,” or “Moscow on the Hudson” because of the large pockets of Jewish residents with roots in Central and Eastern Europe and Russia. Residents with Greek and Irish heritage are scattered around the neighborhood, as well.


Spanish, English, and Russian are the languages you’ll hear most frequently while walking up Broadway, and all three are represented at Word Up. In addition to its astounding diversity, our neighborhood is the second most populated district in Manhattan, and we have the highest concentration of kids in the borough. Word Up is for our neighbors of all backgrounds, of all ages.



Why should you help Word Up open a permanent storefront in Washington Heights, NYC?YOU MISS WORD UP! Perhaps you saw Junot Díaz speak on our stage, or interacted with People’s Theatre Project’s Immigration Circus, or danced bachata with your sweetheart at the Washington Heights Music Festival, or helped your child find a great book by her favorite author on our shelves, or maybe you just had a stimulating conversation with a neighbor. We miss you too! YOU LOVE BOOKS & BOOKSHOPS. We do, too. The all-volunteer crew at Word Up works tirelessly to keep books, and the conversations they generate, a part of our community. Plus, we've done the math: for every dollar donated to Word Up, another book gets distributed to the Northern Manhattan community. YOU’RE A SUPPORTER OF THE ARTS. Word Up is an uptown stop for the NYC literary community, as well as home-base for neighborhood artists and arts organizations. Prior to the existence of Word Up, there was little opportunity for the creative folks in Washington Heights to read their poetry, display their art, perform their plays, drop their new album, or hold a calligraphy workshop under one roof. If you support the arts, you know the importance of generating dialogue and collaboration across disciplines. The unique, community-driven spirit of Word Up encourages exactly that. 

YOU SUPPORT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. Word Up is a creative space for the community, by the community. Even without a brick and mortar location, the Word Up volunteer collective continues to have a presence at many community and city events, including the Little Red Lighthouse Festival, the Young Urban Moms Conference, the Inwood Greenmarket, the launch of the United Palace of Cultural Arts, and many more! 
YOU SUPPORT YOUTH PROGRAMMING. Word Up has hosted events and workshops targeted to our younger neighbors in order to engage the nearly 54,000 residents under the age of 18 in Nothern Manhattan. In fact, young people make up 25% of our neighborhood. At a time when the city is facing more cuts to after-school budgets, community-supported youth programs—like Word Up’s teen writing and theater program developed in collaboration with People’s Theatre Project—are especially crucial.
YOU BELIEVE CREATIVE SPACES ARE AS IMPORTANT AS BIG PROFIT-GENERATORS IN ANY NEIGHBORHOOD, ANYWHERE. In New York City, there are too-big-to-fail banks and big-name pharmacies on every corner, because smaller businesses and creative organizations can’t keep up with rising rent prices. We want to prove the value of open, creative spaces in our neighborhood by reopening Word Up and making it more vibrant than ever.
 




Did you know?Since June 2011, Word Up has:DISTRIBUTED 30,000+ books in English, Spanish, and Russian to our neighbors, many for only $1.FEATURED 1,200+ performers on our stage including Pulitzer Prize–winning author Junot Díaz, radical comic book artist Seth Tobocman, poet Meena Alexander, comedian Tom Shillue, photographer Arlene Gottfried, homeless and formerly homeless artists Concrete Justice, storyteller Michele Carlo, folksinger Ed Askew, local jazz legend Marjorie Eliot, as well as the literary and musical talents of our neighbors.PROVIDED an open space for after-school programs, workshops, community meetings, and language exchanges for our neighbors.SUPPORTED neighborhood authors, artists, and small, independent presses.COLLABORATED with numerous creative organizations and small businesses such as Uptown Collective, United Palace of Cultural Arts, Fresh Press/Fresh Youth Initiatives, Young Urban Moms, Seven Stories Press, Washington Heights Free Radio, Planned Parenthood, World War 3 Illustrated, and so many more.OPERATED thanks to a corps of over 100 volunteers, 7 days a week, for more than 1 year.

 Word Up es un proyecto de Seven Stories Institute, una organización 501(c)(3) sin fines de lucro, de manera que su donación es deducible para efectos impositivos.
  Por qué?  Es simple: nuestro barrio—y todo barrio—necesita un espacio para poder compartir y crear, donde las personas de todo origen, edad y capacidad puedan participar en su comunidad. Word Up ha sido ese espacio para muchos residentes del Norte de Manhattan y para visitas provenientes de otros lugares también. Es verdaderamente un espacio creado para la comunidad, por la comunidad.
  Nuestro objetivo es recaudar más de $60,000 para poder así continuar la importante tarea de promover la escritura y la lectura, las artes, y la conciencia social en uno de los distritos más densamente poblados en Manhattan, con la esperanza de inspirar proyectos semejantes en todo Nueva York, en los Estados Unidos, y en el mundo entero.
 
Qué es Word Up?
Word Up abrió sus puertas el 17 de junio de 2011 como una librería que aparece espontáneamente (un “pop-up shop”), con la intención de participar durante un mes en el Uptown Arts Stroll—un festival que se realiza todos los años en el mes de junio en todo el barrio para celebrar artistas locales en el norte de Manhattan.

 Lo que sucedió en los días siguientes sobrepasó todo lo esperado. Gente—toda clase de gente! desde los más jóvenes hasta los más viejos, residentes nuevos y veteranos, lectores y no-aun-lectores—pasaron rápidamente con gran entusiasmo, y luego permanecieron para formar parte de este cuento curioso que estaba siendo escrito en la historia de esta comunidad.   Los vecinos expresaron variaciones sobre el mismo tema: Nosotros te necesitamos aquí! Se sintieron bienvenidos y se comprometieron más. El frente colorido de nuestro local, en una cuadra donde varios locales están desocupados, se convirtió en un paraíso para aquellos seres de pensamiento libre y para el diálogo verdadero.

 Desde el primer día, los visitantes comenzaron a hacernos muchas preguntas, pero la más frecuente fue “Es posible que ustedes se queden aquí?” Esta pregunta fue repetida tantas veces que finalmente se convirtió en una declaración: “POR FAVOR QUEDENSE.”  Y así fue que nos quedamos.  Gracias a la ayuda de Northern Manhattan Arts Alliance (NoMAA), Seven Stories Institute, y el trabajo de más de 100 voluntarios, Word Up prosperó durante más de un año en 4157 Broadway hasta que los nuevos propietarios del edificio terminaron el contrato de alquiler mensual. A pesar que por el momento no tiene un hogar, Word Up permanece activo en eventos comunitarios, promoviendo la lectura y escritura y las artes en el norte de Manhattan y en la ciudad de Nueva York en general.
 
Cómo es el barrio?
Washington Heights es un barrio diverso étnicamente y económicamente, situado en el norte de Manhattan en la ciudad de Nueva York.
De manera semejante a otros tantos barrios en la Ciudad de Nueva York, Washington Heights es un cruce de varias culturas donde valores y tradiciones diferentes se encuentran, y donde las ideas de muchos grupos de inmigrantes obran recíprocamente. Muchos residentes de Washington Heights tienen sus raíces en la República Dominicana, por lo cual es posible que usted haya escuchado referirse a Washington Heights como a “Quisqueya Heights” o “El Alto.” Las generaciones anteriores captaron el nombre de “Frankfurt sobre el Hudson” o “Moscú sobre el Hudson” debido a las grandes cantidades de residentes Judíos con raíces en Europa Central y Oriental y Rusia. También existen residentes de origen griego e irlandés diseminados por el barrio entero.
Español, inglés y ruso son los idiomas que escuchará más frecuentemente caminando por Broadway, y estos tres idiomas están representados en Word Up. Además de su diversidad asombrosa, nuestro barrio es el segundo distrito más poblado en Manhattan, y tenemos la mayor concentración de niños en el distrito. Word Up sirve a nuestros vecinos de diferentes orígenes, de todas las edades.
 
Por qué usted debe ayudar a Word Up a abrir un local permanente en Washington Heights, NYC?  USTED EXTRAŇA A WORD UP! Tal vez usted lo vio hablar a Junot Díaz en nuestro escenario, o participó en el Immigration Circus del People’s Theatre Project, o bailó bachata con su enamorado en el Festival de la Música en Washington Heights, o le ayudó a su niño a encontrar un libro fabuloso escrito por su autor favorito en nuestros estantes, o tal vez usted solamente tuvo una conversación estimulante con un vecino. Nosotros lo extrañamos a usted también!   USTED AMA A LOS LIBROS Y A LAS LIBRERIAS. Nosotros también. El equipo de Word Up, compuesto de voluntarios únicamente, trabaja infatigablemente para conservar a los libros y al diálogo que ellos generan, como parte de la comunidad. Más aún, hemos hecho nuestros cálculos: por cada dólar donado a Word Up, un libro más es distribuido a la comunidad del norte de Manhattan.
  USTED APOYA A LAS ARTES. Word Up es una estación en el norte de la ciudad para la comunidad literaria, así como también la base del hogar para los artistas locales y las organizaciones artísticas. Previamente a la existencia de Word Up, la gente creativa en Washington Heights no tenía muchas oportunidades para leer sus poesías, exhibir su arte, presentar sus obras de teatro, o conducir un taller de caligrafía, todo bajo un mismo techo. Si usted apoya a los artes, usted reconoce la importancia  de generar el diálogo y la colaboración entre las diferentes disciplinas.     Eso es precisamente lo que fomenta el espíritu único de Word Up, dirigido hacia la comunidad.
USTED APOYA ORGANIZACIONES COMUNITARIAS. Word Up es un espacio creativo para la comunidad, por la comunidad. Aún sin tener un local físico, el colectivo de voluntarios de Word Up conserva su presencia en muchos eventos de la comunidad y de la ciudad, incluyendo el Little Red Lighthouse Festival, la Young Urban Moms Conference, el Inwood Greenmarket, la inauguración del United Palace of Cultural Arts, y muchos más!
USTED APOYA PROGRAMAS PARA LA JUVENTUD. Word ha hospedado eventos y talleres dedicados a nuestros residentes más jóvenes a fin de atraer acerca de 54,000 residentes menores de 18 años en el norte de Manhattan. En realidad, los jóvenes constituyen el 25% de nuestro barrio. En tiempos como éstos en que el presupuesto de los programas para la juventud fuera de las escuelas es reducido, los programas apoyados por la comunidad—tales como el  programa de Word Up de escritores adolescentes y de teatro desarrollado en colaboración con People’s Theatre Project—son crucialmente importantes.
USTED CREE QUE LOS ESPACIOS CREATIVOS SON TAN IMPORTANTES COMO LOS GENERADORES DE GANANCIAS EN CUALQUIER BARRIO, EN CUALQUIER SITIO. En la ciudad de Nueva York, existen bancos y farmacias poderosos en cada esquina debido a que los comercios más pequeños y las organizaciones creativas no pueden pagar los alquileres que van aumentando. Queremos demostrar el valor de los espacios creativos en nuestra comunidad abriendo una vez más Word Up y convirtiéndolo en un centro mas vibrante que nunca.
 
Usted sabía?  Desde junio  2011, Word Up ha:  DISTRIBUIDO más de 30,000 libros en inglés, español, y ruso a nuestros vecinos, muchos de ellos por $1 solamente.  PRESENTADO a más de 1,200 artistas en nuestro escenario incluyendo al autor Junot Díaz ganador del Premio Pulitzer, el artista radical de libros cómicos Seth Tobocman, el poeta Meena Alexander, el comediante Tom Shillue, la fotógrafa Arlene Gottfried, artistas sin hogar en el pasado y en el presente Concrete Justice, la narradora de cuentos Michele Carlo, el cantante popular Ed Askew, la leyenda local del jazz Marjorie Eliot, así como los talentos literarios y musicales de nuestros vecinos.   PROVEIDO un espacio abierto para programas fuera de las escuelas, talleres, reuniones comunitarias, e intercambio de idiomas para nuestros vecinos.  
APOYADO a autores, artistas, y pequeñas prensas independientes.  COLABORADO con muchas organizaciones creativas y negocios pequeños tal como Uptown Collective, United Palace of Cultural Arts, Fresh Press/Fresh Youth Initiatives, Young Urban Moms, Seven Stories Press, Washington Heights Free Radio, Planned Parenthood, World War 3 Illustrated, y muchos más.  OPERADO gracias a un equipo de más de 100 voluntarios, 7 días por semana, durante más de un año.
 

El capítulo próximo: Nosotros estamos buscando activamente un nuevo local en Washington Heights. Cada semana la comisión encargada de encontrar una propiedad para Word Up presenta un informe con fotografías e información relevante sobre locales potenciales. Lo examinamos. Deliberamos. Obtenemos estimaciones del costo de arreglos y construcción. Es un proceso lento.  Hasta que encontremos un local que satisface las necesidades de nuestra comunidad de la mejor manera posible, usted puede encontrar el colectivo de voluntarios de Word Up en los eventos comunitarios alrededor de Washington Heights. Fíjese en nuestra página de web dónde tendrá lugar el próximo evento!

</div></div>","Our Story
The New Mexico Center for Therapeutic Riding is
a certified member of PATH (Professional Association of Therapeutic
Horsemanship) an international, highly accredited therapeutic horseback riding
program for individuals and families with special physical, cognitive and
emotional needs with over 350 centers worldwide.
 
Our center is a non-profit organization. Our
curriculum for the past five years includes all equine assisted activities and
our therapeutic services produce tangible physical, psychological, cognitive,
social and educational benefits.
 
Our program is located in a peaceful setting at
a private stable on over 100 acres in Santa Fe, NM. Our PATH certified
instructors design each lesson with the following goals in mind: physical
development, emotional growth and intellectual stimulation. We strive to
accomplish our goals in a safe, fun, family and community oriented atmosphere.
 
The horse is a motivator that connects therapy
through movement to sport, pleasure and education. The dynamic relationships
among students, teachers, volunteers and horses strengthens our program. This
community family is enhanced through summer camps, horse shows, trail rides,
birthdays and holiday parties.
 
Our vision is to create a larger, premier
public facility that will partner with local government institutions that
have children and adults that will benefit from our center. We receive revenue
from grants, schools, individual lessons and from charitable donations.
 
We had an amazing past year because of the
tremendous interest in our center and our goal is to grow at least 100% this
year. We have very low administration costs (a program director/teacher) and a
large, wonderful group of dedicated volunteers. 
 
The horses are our biggest expense and because
of the fires in neighboring states this past year, the price of hay has
tripled. Please help us keep these wonderful animals who are so very important
to the people we help by donating to our cause.
 
The New Mexico Center for Therapeutic Riding is
a tax exempt, non-profit charitable organization under the umbrella of the New
Mexico Community Foundation. All donations are tax deductible .
 
The Impact

Therapeutic horseback riding because of it's
group orientation format, can provide significant help to many children with
physical and behavioral needs which in turn also helps the parents and other
family members cope. The almost instantaneous benefits of therapeutic riding
are key to changing attitudes and well being of the children and helping
families continue on a path towards improvement and progress that leads to a
lifetime of accomplishment.
  
Children/Adults with special needs:
Family members see for themselves the benefits
that therapeutic horseback riding offers. The improvement is evident after the
first session and the possibilities are endless! After a session with a horse
the self-image, persona and the self-confidence of the child with a disability
is greatly impacted thus opening the way to more improvement and achievement.
The interaction with the animal improves motor skills and social skills as well
as other physical and behavioral challenges they might face (Imagine a wheelchair bound child sitting on a
horse and looking down at people, from a position of strength, for the first
time.)
 
Parents/Family members with special needs:
Parents with special needs children often feel
overwhelmed and isolated. Through the community activity that therapeutic
riding offers they are afforded the opportunity to share experiences, ideas,
successes and disappointments with people who have similar situations and are
able to lend an understanding and supportive ear, particularly in times of
stress. The parents are the most important source of motivation and support for
the child. It is vital that they be given as much assistance as possible in
fulfilling this role.
 
Community:
Our primary target audiences are students in
the public school system who have physical and behavioral special needs. At
present there are over 700 students in our public schools with special needs
that would benefit from therapeutic horseback riding. (We are currently serving
85+ students and want to enlarge our enrollment). We are also working with our
County Health and Human Services as well as other organizations to provide a
program for seniors who have special needs. We also have families who are
economically disadvantaged that we help. The impact on the community when one
of our beneficiaries succeeds and is able to function better in society and
lead a more productive life is immeasurable.  
 
With your financial help we will achieve this
... It is a win-win situation!  
We are improving lives one stride
at a time!
 
What We Need & What You Get

Yearly Costs for keeping one
horse for NMCTR:
 
Basic veterinary care (check ups
and inoculations): $150
Hoof trimming (around $40 every 6
weeks): $360
A year's worth of hay: $1,200
Boarding cost: $1,000  
Total: $2,710 per horse.
Currently we have 10 horses. The cost to keep all of the horses for a year is
$27,100. 
 
This year we would like to add
two more horses to the NMCTR family. Each new horse would cost $2,500.
 
Your donation would go towards
supporting the cost of the horses. Donating $25 would pay for one lesson with a
horse. Donating $50 would pay for four bales of hay. Donating $100 would pay
for three hoof trimmings. Besides the warm, fuzzy feeling you get from knowing
that you made a difference, you also receive great NMCTR swag for your
contribution! 
 
The NMCTR relies on donations and
volunteering to stay in business. Grants and private donations provide most of
our funding, also we rely on in-kind donations and volunteer time from the
local community. We hold annual fundraising events locally. All of the funds we
receive are managed through the Santa Fe Community Foundation, an organization
with a proven record of making a difference in the community. Every penny donated
makes a positive impact in the lives of people with special needs.

<h2>My name is Catrina Kroeger</h2>
<p>I am in my second year as a student at Saint Mary's College of Notre Dame. I'm paying for all expenses myself, which has proven to be a struggle. I am currently pursuing a double major in Political Science and Spanish. I have a part-time job as a means to send myself to college. I participate in fund raising for Riley's Children's Hospital, in hopes of becoming a stronger candidate for future employers and a more connected future professional.</p>
<p>I have just recently decided to turn my Spanish minor into a second major. My dream is to spend the Spring 2013 academic semester in Seville, Spain as a part of my academic and personal growth. Spanish Studies Abroad is a program that provides an opportunity for U.S. students to live with a host family in another country. It allows us to enroll in a foreign university, participate in academic courses for credit. Study abroad is recognized by both academia and the workforce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While I am in Spain, I will be attending La Universidad de Sevilla, and earning credits towards both of my majors. Most importantly, my goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Language proficiency: to immerse myself in the Spanish language and culture, which will make me more knowledgeable about and able to communicate with a new interesting group of people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">To become a more productive member of society and my own community by utilizing the knowledge and perspectives I gain while abroad.</span></p>

<p>To obtain a degree in Spanish, so that I can use it as a means of gaining employment after graduation.</p>

<h3><strong>What I Need</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The tuition cost of the Study Abroad program is the same as the cost of Saint Mary's tuition. This cost is <span style=""color: #000000;"">$16,280 per semester. I have taken out $5000 in loans for this year. Room and board fee for the program is $5070, which I do not normally pay because I live off campus. This is what I need to first come up with, in order to go to Spain. The Study Abroad Fee is $360. This is a total of $5430 on top of all loans and expenses that I normally pay. The cost of the tuition for the program does not include airfare, visa/passport costs, books, materials/supplies, food or spending money while I am in Spain. According the the estimated costs, I will need roughly $2635 for these expenses. My ultimate goal is to raise $6,000 for this trip.</span></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings! My name is Rachel Simpson. For the last 6 years of my life, I've been passionately pursuing both my love to teach and visual arts. I began this path by going back to school at first to Whatcom Community College, then transferred to Western Washington University (WWU), to be in the Arts program, and I'm enrolled in Woodring College of Education for my degree in Secondary Arts Education (high school teaching).</p>
<p>After 5+ years of being a full-time student with a 3.5 GPA, I'm close to completing my Secondary Arts Education degree, with big dreams of becoming experienced in global teaching. The last phase of my program is to student teach Visual Arts next fall semester in a high school.</p>
<p>I've been given the chance to be a part of the Educators Abroad Program via WWU &amp; Woodring College of Education, to go study abroad in Europe for 3 months. I hope to be placed in either Italy or Spain. Just by each one of you helping by giving a small amount of only $10-20 to raise these funds, I'll be able to afford my plane tickets &amp; pay for the required student program fees.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ol>
<li>The costs of a round-trip flight range anywhere between $1100-$1500 and the Educators Abroad program fee is $300.</li>
<li>By donating to this fund, you will enable me to study in an international high school along side a highly experienced educator, while learning what it is like to be immersed within another culture, within another country, to better my overall outlook on education and the visual arts.</li>
<li>Even if I don't reach the final goal of $1500, I will still put it toward my planned trip to Europe in this program, for the upcoming fall semester. I'm utilizing every possible resource I have to come up with the total amount necessary to reach this new beginning in my life of multicultural education within the arts.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You will be a part of a greater global community for our future in education, in our economy, critical thinking skills, and the future of our world becoming ever more global. Why? Because I very much plan to come back to the United States to teach students how to be creative, independent, critical thinkers, inventors, and to see the world in a much bigger picture.</p>
<p>I have already successfully observed and taught in both high school and a middle school, as a part of my independent studies and my practicum classes in college. I've been accepted to join the honors role as my GPA is a 3.5 while I continue my last quarter of classes over this school year.</p>
<p>I will be updating a Blog webpage with my daily opportunities, experiences, in both writing and photographs. (Either a Livejournal or a Google Blog &amp; it will be updated here) You will be able to subscribe, read, comment, and watch to see how my trip to Europe will be. </p>
<p>While I know this may seem like a pipe dream to be able to travel abroad to another country, I don't believe it is just that. It is a chance for me to grow and learn from an amazing experience, while at the same time, gaining the understanding, compassion, and knowledge of what I need to be a qualified, credited, and certified educator for Washington state. It is more than a dream. It is a vision that I am going to succeed at doing.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Today there is an ever-widening gap emerging between those that succeed and those shun education (and lose out).  Disadvantaged students rarely have the opportunity to participate in <strong>learning opportunities that utilize higher technology</strong> (<em>along with access to cutting-edge resources</em>). Aside from <em>access to resources</em>, economic deprivation and social background are also major factors which can instill a sense of disillusion with education. </p>

<p>In the Fall of 2012, 21st Century Youth Project (21CYP) will join forces with the House Development Corporation, as the technology component of the FirehouseCommunityArtsCenter.  This will enable us to actively reach out to (and enroll) around 50 students at a time. As the interest on-site continues to grow, we expect our enrollment rates to continue to climb upwards to as much as <strong>200</strong><strong> </strong><strong>youths</strong><strong> per day</strong>. The House Development Corporation was the brainchild of Phil Jackson, who served for many years as youth pastor of Lawndale Community Church (<em>under 'Coach' Wayne Gordon</em>) and also created a unique hip-hop church for youth residing in North Lawndale. Embracing the hip-hop culture of rap, rhythm, graffiti, spoken word, and music, <em>Pastor Phil and The House</em> have been <strong><em>featured on NBC Nightly News, ABC7 news, BET, FOX, PBS, and WGN</em>.</strong></p>
<p>In 2007, the House Development Corporation bought a historic Chicago Firehouse to renovate for the purpose of becoming the FirehouseCommunityArtsCenter.   <strong>What was the purpose?</strong>  To be able to offer daily arts training and mentoring in a creative, nurturing environment, while teaching youth marketable skills through entrepreneurship.   </p>
<p>T<strong>he 21<sup>st</sup> Century Youth Project</strong> strives to provide a high-quality, accessible and free after-school education that enables and empowers its diverse cluster of students in order to help develop their intellectual gifts. We are offering education and hi-tech training opportunities, and student success is one of our highest priorities; <strong>we aim to give students the chance to succeed</strong><strong> by providing </strong><strong>access</strong><strong>to tools that engage their interest</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>develop their leadership skills</strong><strong> through </strong><strong>entrepreneurial activity</strong>. Through the support of entrepreneurs and tech enthusiasts, students will develop the skills needed to succeed in the 21st century workplace. </p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The 21CYP teaches students that…<strong>Technology</strong><strong> is a path to </strong><strong>Opportunity</strong>.  It is a <strong>free</strong><strong> &amp; </strong><strong>comprehensive</strong> after school program that prepares low-income middle and high school students for STEM (<em>Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math</em>) careers. </p>
<p>The program focuses on improving skills <strong>Today</strong> (<em>through teaching and tutoring</em>), <strong>Tomorrow</strong> (<em>through coaching and mentoring</em>), and In the <strong>Future</strong> (<em>through internship placement</em>) with an entrepreneurial focus. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Deliverables for student participants include the <strong>creation of mobile apps (for Google Android, iPhone, iPad, etc.), accompanying business plans, accrual of college credits</strong> and case studies for their future resumes and portfolios (<em>due to hands-on tangible skills gained through internship placements</em>). </p>
<p>21CYP harnesses a students’ natural <strong>enthusiasm</strong><strong> for </strong><strong>technology</strong> showing them how they can become the designers of the future; <em>while at the same</em> time, delivering foundational skills in STEM curricula.</p>
<p>The program has <strong>multiple levels of </strong><strong>involvement</strong> not only training students in <strong>business, technology, and math</strong>, but also further developing their <strong>critical thinking skills</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>entrepreneurial ability</strong><strong>while bolstering self-confidence</strong>. The 21st Century Youth Project was inspired by the ideas outlined in Malcolm Gladwell’s book “<em>Outliers: The Story of Success</em>,” specifically the concept that “<strong>success is a matter of perfect placement, timing and training</strong>”.  </p>
<p>Since our launch in 2011, the 21st Century Youth Project has held its 13-week session programs in several cities covering <strong>Mobile</strong><strong> Programming, </strong><strong>SAT</strong><strong> Math, and </strong><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong><strong> for youth ages 13-18 in Chicago</strong>. We are experiencing tremendous interest here in Chicago and in other cities as well. We will continue to work on partnering with local community centers to bring these service offerings into communities on a nationwide scale. We will also be launching a web-based platform similar to Khan Academy and other online schools, enabling our students to access tremendous instruction, <em>without the additional costs incurred through traditional expansion</em>. We can basically ""<strong>flip the classroom</strong>"" while adhering to a strict curriculum that engages a network of students which we hope to connect with engineering colleges and other institutions across the country.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even though our program is self-sustaining and is <strong>off to a </strong><strong>great</strong><strong> start</strong>, we do <strong>need your </strong><strong>help</strong><strong>to continue </strong>to grow.  It is our goal to become the <strong>#1</strong> go-to program in the community for cutting-edge technical resources and relevant training for underrepresented youth.    </p>
<p><strong>This journey begins during our Firehouse partnership</strong><em> – 21CYP plans to reach more than 200 students by holding three weekly two-day sessions in 13-weeks. </em> </p>
<p align=""center"">The 21st Century Youth Project has had a remarkable positive impact on our local Chicago communities.  Subsequently, we have also been featured on <strong>CNN, in magazines</strong> (<strong>Crain’s Chicago Business, SiliconAngle, and Techli</strong>), and has won a <strong>Gold award in education’s Best New Product in the </strong><strong>Edison Awards</strong> <em>by a selection panel that consisted of around 3,000 professionals, academics and specialists</em>.</p>

Today there is an ever-widening gap emerging between those that succeed and those shun education (and lose out).  Disadvantaged students rarely have the opportunity to participate in learning opportunities that utilize higher technology (along with access to cutting-edge resources). Aside from access to resources, economic deprivation and social background are also major factors which can instill a sense of disillusion with education.

IT’S TIME TO PREPARE OUR YOUTH
FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE WITH BETTER TOOLS!
 
 
 
In the Fall of 2012, 21st Century Youth Project (21CYP) will join forces with the House Development Corporation, as the technology component of the FirehouseCommunityArtsCenter.  This will enable us to actively reach out to (and enroll) around 50 students at a time. As the interest on-site continues to grow, we expect our enrollment rates to continue to climb upwards to as much as 200 youths per day. The House Development Corporation was the brainchild of Phil Jackson, who served for many years as youth pastor of Lawndale Community Church (under 'Coach' Wayne Gordon) and also created a unique hip-hop church for youth residing in North Lawndale. Embracing the hip-hop culture of rap, rhythm, graffiti, spoken word, and music, Pastor Phil and The House have been featured on NBC Nightly News, ABC7 news, BET, FOX, PBS, and WGN.
In 2007, the House Development Corporation bought a historic Chicago Firehouse to renovate for the purpose of becoming the FirehouseCommunityArtsCenter.   What was the purpose?  To be able to offer daily arts training and mentoring in a creative, nurturing environment, while teaching youth marketable skills through entrepreneurship.   
The 21st Century Youth Project strives to provide a high-quality, accessible and free after-school education that enables and empowers its diverse cluster of students in order to help develop their intellectual gifts. We are offering education and hi-tech training opportunities, and student success is one of our highest priorities; we aim to give students the chance to succeed by providing accessto tools that engage their interest and develop their leadership skills through entrepreneurial activity. Through the support of entrepreneurs and tech enthusiasts, students will develop the skills needed to succeed in the 21st century workplace. 
 
 “Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.” 
- Steve Jobs
Since 2011, the 21st Century Youth Project has been committed to providing access to advanced mobile technology and 21st century skills (which are necessary to become the tech leaders and creators of tomorrow) to youths from underrepresented communities.    
We’re Winning the Battle…

The Realities we are ALL Facing…

American students rank 25th in math and 21st in science, compared with students in 30 industrialized countries, and the Broad Foundation estimates $192 billion in lost income and taxes due to dropouts each year.
Only 15 % of US college students earn degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) areas compared to 50 % and higher overseas.  Because of this, the placement rate for Computer Science students can range upwards of 95% at leading universities.
According to Afterschool Alliance, more than 25% of America’s school children are on their own after 3pm on school days.
 
 
The program model for 21CYP is based on closing the technological achievement gap for students who lack access to good resources; while at the same time, giving them marketable entrepreneurial skills to be used to join the global STEM workforce. 
The 21st Century Youth Project (21CYP) selects low-income students in grades 5-12 and interjects the idea of spending more time on S.T.E.M. learning through means of real-life application.  21CYP is an after school model that’s broken into 4 x 13-week phases. 
≈
Phase 1:Immersion – Connect with fellow students and business/program directors.
Phase 2:Concept Development – Learn about building a product (i.e. a mobile app) while following a tailored curriculum that’s delivered to you by esteemed professionals.
Phase 3:Business Course – Collaborate with instructors to develop, practice, and deliver a pitch for “mobile app demo day”.
Phase 4:Post-21CYP Access– Alumni students are encouraged to share resources and engage in mentoring relationships.  
 
 
 
*Below are the current offerings that 21CYP specializes in:

Mobile App Development using the Google Android and iOS platform

SAT Math Training
Business Planning
Mentorship Programs 

Instructor Mentor, College Mentor, Community/ProfessionalMentor

Tutoring
Student Consulting Projects (Experiential Learning – students after 1yr. integrate 21CYP learning’s and work into the form of a deliverable product [web design, mobile app, etc.] for local businesses.)
Internship Placement

Alumni Community

<p>We have reached our initial funding goal. Thanks to all who participated. If further funds are raised we will first bring electricity to the school ($350.00) and second begin funding our Nepali Women's Scholarship Program!</p>
<p>Please come with me for a moment to Central Nepal.</p>
<p>My name is Todd and in 2011 I traveled to central Nepal to visit a small village and its school. I have assisted at various educational projects over the years but have decided to place all of my efforts here. In addition to the project described below we have begun a series of Social Businesses whose focus is in providing scholarships for young women in Nepal. So often they are unable to partake in higher education due to gender based socio-economic living conditions. Our current water project is described below.</p>
<p> The Shree Saraswoti Kunja primary school is located in the village of Loruk in central Nepal, just outside of Pokhara. It is nestled in a valley of rice farmers surrounded by the foothills of the Himalayas. A beautiful place where subsistence living creates many boundaries. Food, clean water and education are just three. The government primary school is home to approximately 110 children with 85 attending on any given day. Only the basics are available at the six room school. No electricity, no water, some desks, a few books but I have to tell you; There is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm in the students for education. The teaching staff is kind, knowledgeable and motivated but is in need of help.</p>
<p> We began working at the school in Loruk days after we arrived. We began by assessing the school structure itself. Windows were missing, doors were off their hinges, and floors were a mixture of dirt and degraded cement. Most of all the school needed paint. We decided we would begin these necessary repairs. Through the help of many volunteers, masons, woodworkers and dozens of paintbrushes we were able to restore the school to a colorful, clean focal point of education for the valley. Many thanks to all of the volunteers that helped with the project. Adam, Berry, Rosmary, Amy and Stephan to name just a few.</p>
<p>Books, teaching aids and basic supplies were also purchased. Later in the year we began the completion of an adjacent building that the Nepali government was unable to finish. Soon it too will be echoing the children's voices of grades 6 and 7.</p>
<p> One major component that is missing at the school is clean water. Water for many uses but most importantly for drinking and personal hygiene.</p>
<p> We have located a spring 2000 meters (1.3 miles) up the mountain that has fresh, cool, clean drinking water. This water is unpolluted and the owner of the land has agreed to allow us to tap into and create an intake to collect the water to. Tapping into the spring necessitates creating an intake, a sand filter and a 3,000 liter tank (750 gallons) at the spring-head. After the tank we will bury 1” pipe in the ground except where it needs to cross two rivers. We can’t cross the river below ground because during the monsoon season it becomes torrential rapids with large boulders constantly moving downstream. In order to cross the rivers we will need to change to metal pipe and elevate it for that part of its passage. On the waters gravity fed journey it will pass rice farms, small forests, livestock pens and vegetable gardens. When it arrives at the school we will place a 1000 liter (250 gallon) tank on the top of the school. From there the water will flow directly to taps for the children’s use.</p>
<p> Water, such an essential that I feel we so often take for granted. What would we do without it? Or how would our lives be changed if it was rationed or not available? Can you imagine your early school years without available water?</p>
<p> Our request for help is simple and I truly believe that your single act of kindness will be returned to you many times over. We have 2000 meters (6000 feet) to pipe the water to the school.</p>
<p> If you could afford $5.00 it would purchase 5 meters (15 feet) of pipe and we will keep you updated on our progress and also send you a photo of the children.</p>
<p> If you could afford $5.00 it would purchase 5 meters (15 feet) of pipe and we will keep you updated on our progress and also send you a photo of the children.</p>

<p> If you would be able to donate $100.00 it would purchase 100 meters (300 feet) of pipe and we will send you a photo and place your name on the elevated sections of pipe that will be crossing the rivers.</p>
<p> What better way of continuing your money’s work and the merit of your donation than having the water continuously passing by your name. Day by day, Year after year.</p>

 What better way of continuing your money’s work and the merit of your donation than having the water continuously passing by your name. Day by day, Year after year.
Thank you for this opportunity to present to you our request for funding, and please even if you cannot donate at this time help us by spreading the word.

<h3>My Story:</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica;"">Growing up in the
Midwest for all 22 years of my life has limited the amount of diversity I’ve
been able to experience. Since I was a little girl I have longed to understand
others different than myself and serve those who are oppressed and discriminated against. I have
simultaneously felt that same longing and passion for traveling to experience
and understand diversity among cultures and the world around me. When I learned
that I could work in a profession whose main focus is what I have longed to do
since I was a little girl, I knew that I had to be a part of it. I am now in my
senior year of college at Missouri State University where I am working towards
finishing my bachelors in Social Work. To graduate from my program in May 2014,
I must complete a 450-hour practicum. In the beginning of this semester I
searched out international practicum opportunities in which I was officially
offered a position with the Children and Youth Divisions of Social Services in
Hudiksvall, Sweden. I will be living there for four months, from the beginning
of January until the end of April. <span style=""""> </span></span></p>

<p></p>
<p>Education, knowledge and research are crucial. I believe that creating global dialogue about issues that remain

<p>Reconciliation wasn't just a political process that
happened, it was a personal experience for millions of people. Social divisions across
boundaries of race and class <b>can be overcome</b>. We can build bridges with stronger, more meaningful relationships between us. <b>Democracy alone, can't do it for us. </b><br/></p>
<p>What is so important about this research, is that is covers and issue that isn’t just true for the situation in South Africa. Countries across the world where division across racial boundaries still exists, including in my own the UK, can be improved. The dissertation I’m writing is on a concept called ‘Radical
Reconciliation’. <b>Be a

</h2></div>","ClassBytes
Our goal is to pass on the knowledge and skills necessary to help the next generation of electronic tinkerers and computer programmers.


ClassBytes will offer:

-Education - classes geared toward beginning & advanced students


-Mentoring – giving students an  environment where knowledge, self guided research, & leadership can be developed-Outreach - bringing together students from the Austin, Cedar Park, Pflugerville, & Round Rock, TX communities to educate the future thinkers of the world.

ClassBytes brings a fun, interactive computer & electronics lab to the home school and after school communities.With your help, we hope to set up a computer lab to educate students ages 13 - 99 in basic to advanced computer & electronic skills.
BackgroundHi! My name is George and I am trying to bring my vision of Class Bytes to life!
It was Christmas 1989. Under the tree I would find a Vtech Laser 50 Educational Computer, and my interest in computers was born!


My fascination with computers grew watching my older brother play video games.  We had several gaming systems: the Atri 2600, Coleco Vision, ADAM computer system. He and I played PacMan, Tapper, Fortune Builder, and occasionally I would watch him program in Logo.In retrospect, I must pay homage to my great high school computer science teacher, Ms Thompson.  She helped to cement my enjoyment of computers & played a vital role in advancing my education. It wasn't long before I discovered my love for computers & electronics!
I have a passion for computers!  From my “orange” screen luggable 45 Hz Gridcase Model 1520...

...to the many different Windows and Linux machines I have built over the years!While attending the University of Texas at Austin, I worked in the  W. R. Woolrich Computer Lab. There, I maintained the computer lab with over 40 PCs running a variety of engineering software, such as Matlab and Mathematica.

After attending the University of Texas for Computer Science, I worked for International Business Machines.At IBM, I tested and debugged laptops before they hit the production line. 
I was then recruited by the up and coming computer company Dell. There, I installed custom software on business machines – sometimes the orders totalled over 1000 computers a day!

Then one day I noticed that I was not doing what I enjoyed – tinkering with, and teaching others about, computers.  I decided that I wanted to start my own lab, geared toward teaching young ""novices"" about the things I love most - Computers!  So, in August of 2012, ClassBytes.net was born, and the journey to start my own computer lab had begun!  

Now you can find Class Bytes on Facebook and Twitter, where I post ideas & projects for future Class Bytes activities!


I have developed curriculums for:-Introduction to Computer Hardware-Introduction Web Design-Advanced Web Design-Introduction Programing-Advanced Programing  -Introduction to Game Design-Advanced Game Design-Introduction to ElectronicsI am currently managing a network of five Raspberry Pi Linux based computers(see below for more details)


I have started to make contacts with local after school, home school, and church communities
The Lab!



After much research, I have decided to make the Raspberry Pi the main cornerstone of the computer lab. For those of you that are not familiar with the Raspberry Pi, it is a very compact computer that was developed with computer and electronic education in mind.The Raspberry Pi is a small computer that was designed for programming and electrical experimentation. The computer was developed with Python, which is great programming language to introduce new students to the world of programming. The Raspberry Pi is also capable of running many of the leading programming languages of today – including C, C++, and Java.  
Ever since the Raspberry Pi appeared, the Internet has been a buzz with different DIY (Do-It-Yourself) projects & self-made experiments which create new and interesting devices that, just a few years ago, would not have been possible.Raspberry Pi with Breadboard. 
A breadboard is used to test electrical circuits without the need to permanently solder wires in place. This way, you can quickly test circuit designs. In the above picture, the Raspberry Pi is controlling 3 LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) which blink, controlled by software on the Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi & Monitor powered by AA batteries
The above image highlights the portability of the Raspberry Pi system. Here we have the Raspberry Pi & monitor running on several AA Batteries. The display screen is a low-powered TFT (Thin Film Transistor) 7in. monitor. One benefit of Class Bytes' Computer Lab is that it will be completely mobile. The entire “Rasberry Pi Lab” can be packed up & easily transported to homes, outdoor class projects, or events! 


Another goal of the fund raiser is to acquire 10 Snap Circuits kits (SC-750R Student Stations) to go along with each computer station.

Snap Circuits SC-750R Kit


The SC750R is a great, all-encompassing system for learning electronics in a safe & exciting way. There is limitless room for experimentation, and the system is battery powered & very portable.Where Your Funding Goes-
The main expense in creating Class Bytes' Computer Lab, is the lab itself.

I have searched & discovered the most economic way to get as many working computers into a lab with as little set-up as possible.

A Raspberry Pi Computer Workstation


A Single Raspberry Pi Computer Workstation costs between $75-$150, and includes:
-Raspberry Pi Computer (w/protective case)
-Monitor
-Keyboard
-Mouse
-SD Card
  One goal of this Class Bytes fundraiser is to fund the purchase of 6 more computer stations.  This would bring the total number of student lab stations to 10.


If the fundraiser yields more than our goals, additional computer systems can be purchased for loaning to students that do not have access to computers at home, and for community events & workshops for underprivileged students.

To be more concise, funding will go to:

1. More Raspberry Pi Computers

2. Needed Computer Peripherals, such as Keyboards, Mice, SD cards, Power Cables, Wireless Cards, & Monitors

3. Snap Circuits SC-750R Student Training Electronic Kits

4. Tools & Parts necessary for running Electronic Experiments, including:
    -Breadboards

    -Cables (Copper Wire)

    -Batteries
    -LED's (Light Emitting Diodes) 

    -Motors
    -Sensors
    -Transistors, Resisters, Diodes, etc.


5. A Video Projector & Projection Screen that will allow the students to see the Teacher's Computer Screen in Real Time  


6. Desks, Chairs, Office Supplies & Other Classroom-Related Necessities

<h3>Hi, </h3>
<p>My name is Jerri Johnson.  I am a single mother and Doctoral Student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis in the department of Teaching and Learning.  I am entering my 17th year as an educator in urban and suburban districts in St. Louis, Missouri, Indianapolis, Indiana, and Kansas City, Missouri.  I have served as a classroom teacher, Reading Specialist, Instructional Coach, Assistant Principal and District Administrator.  Currently, I am an Instructional Coach trying to complete my Doctorate program (Ph.D.). </p>
<p>I have an chance, through the University, to present my research at an international conference in Bangkok, Thailand in January.  Even though I have not completed my research the opportunity has presented itself and I am excited. However, there are expenses to be paid before I can go.  The prospect of presenting my research to an international audience before it is even completed if HUGE!  The feedback that I could receive would be priceless! I would also get to visit schools and colleges in order to observe teaching and learning in Thailand.  Eventually I would like to publish my research in an international journal and continue to provide more research in the area of teaching and learning (education).  </p>
<p>I love being an educator and any chance I get to further my craft and give back to my community, parents, colleagues and students, I try to take advantage of it.  Your contribution would greatly help me in this endeavor. </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What I Need</strong> </p>
<p>The total amount that I would need would be $3000. This would cover the cost of my travel, transportation and meals while presenting at the conference.  The university will be taking care of the hotel stay. I also will have to register for 4 extra credit hours  for the spring semester, this will cost me $1600. If I do not reach my entire goal the funds will be applied to my travel first ($1400). JUST $100 from 30 people can get me there!!! </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm sure that you have known or know a undergraduate, graduate or doctoral student. The financial pressure of being a single mother and student is high. Meanwhile the cost of tuition and educating yourself is rising.  I plan to teach our future teachers using my doctorate degree that I will be obtaining in December 2014. Your contribution will get me one step closer to contributing to the education of future students and teachers. My hope is that this will be the first of many international conferences In which i will attend and present in my quest for knowledge regarding the international education of students. I would love if YOU could help me contribute to OUR future! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! Our names are Marwin Arellano and Elizabeth Sanchez.</p>
<p>We are two first generation Latino students, passionate about social justice and education as a form of empowerment.  We want to participate in a Literacy Brigade in San Salvador, El Salvador this summer with CISPES (Commitee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador).  In this Literacy Brigade, we will be promoting the literacy program in communities where it is needed most, doing outreach to get more community members involved in this critical and resource limited program, and attending local literacy circles where we will be assisting volunteers.  We believe that education is a fundamental step in empowering ourselves and our communities, that international solidarity is critical, and that both of these things are needed towards envisioning and enacting social justice. </p>

<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>We need 4,000 dollars to help offset the cost for both of us to get there and participate.  As students, we don't have much money, so any support helps!  Donations will be spent on:</p>
<p>-Airfare   </p>
<p>-Housing</p>
<p>-Supplies to take such as: pencils,pens, notebooks, reading glasses, and portable cd/mp3 players (The program uses digital recordings to increase acess to literacy classes. </p>
<p>-Part of what we pay to participate in the Literacy Brigade will also help fund more local grassroots community organizing in El Salvador.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In El Salvador, <strong>18% of citizens over the of age 15 – 690,000 people - can not read or write, with significantly higher illiteracy rates among women than men</strong>. In 2009, the new Ministry of Education began the National Literacy Program with the goal of reducing illiteracy by 4% over 5 years, as a stepping stone towards 0% illiteracy by 2021. In a dramatic departure from previous administration's nominal education investment, the budget for the Literacy Program was increased 10-fold in 2009 – from less than $4 million to $40 million dollars  - to jumpstart this immense national effort. <strong>Since then, over 100,000 people have been taught to read and write through 15,000 volunteer-led literacy circles across the nation, using innovative curriculum that relies on both in-person teachers and lessons aired by community radio stations. About 14,000 Salvadoran students and community members have volunteered their time to contribute to this enormous, concerted effort against illiteracy to date.</strong></p>
<p>En El Salvador,<strong> 18% de los ciudadanos sobre la edad de 15 – 690.000 personas – no pueden leer ni escribir, con índices más altos para las mujeres que para los hombres. </strong> En el 2009, el nuevo Ministro de Educación comenzó un Programa Nacional de Alfabetización con la meta de reducir el analfabetismo por 4% entre cinco anos, como un paso primero hacia 0% de analfabetismo en el 2021.  Con la nueva orientación del gobierno,  el presupuesto del Programa de Alfabetización ahora es 10 veces más grande que los presupuestos de los gobiernos anteriores, de menos de $4 millones antes de 2009 a $40 millones actualmente -para lanzar este gran esfuerzo nacional.  <strong>Desde 2009, más de 100.000 personas han aprendido leer y escribir a través de 15.000 círculos comunitarios dirigidos por voluntarios en muchas zonas del país. Se usa un currículo innovador que depende de clases con maestro/s tal como clases transmitidas por las estaciones de radios comunitarios.  Hasta la fecha, cerca de 14.000 estudiantes universitarios/as s y otros/as miembros de la comunidad han ofrecido su tiempo para contribuir a este esfuerzo enorme contra el analfabetismo.</strong><br/><br/></p>

Hello! Our names are Marwin Arellano and Elizabeth Sanchez.
We are two first generation Latino students, passionate about social justice and education as a form of empowerment.  We want to participate in a Literacy Brigade in San Salvador, El Salvador this summer with CISPES (Commitee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador).  In this Literacy Brigade, we will be promoting the literacy program in communities where it is needed most, doing outreach to get more community members involved in this critical and resource limited program, and attending local literacy circles where we will be assisting volunteers.  We believe that education is a fundamental step in empowering ourselves and our communities, that international solidarity is critical, and that both of these things are needed towards envisioning and enacting social justice. 


¡Hola! Nos llamamos Marwin Arellano y Elizabeth Sanchez.Somos dos estudiantes latinos de primera generación, apasionados por la justicia social y la educación como una forma de empoderamiento. Queremos participar en un Programa de Alfabetización en San Salvador, El Salvador este verano con CISPES.  En este program, estaremos promoviendo el programa de alfabetización en las comunidades donde más se necesita, haciendo difusión para conseguir más miembros de la comunidad que participan en este programa crítico y de recursos mínimos, y asistir a los círculos de alfabetización locales donde se asisten a los voluntarios. Creemos que la educación es un paso fundamental en la potenciación de nosotros mismos y nuestras comunidades, que la solidaridad internacional es fundamental, y que ambas cosas son necesarias para imaginar la promulgación de la justicia social.




What We Need:
We need 4,000 dollars to help offset the cost for both of us to get there and participate.  As students, we don't have much money, so any support helps!  Donations will be spent on:
-Airfare   
-Housing
-Supplies to take such as: pencils,pens, notebooks, reading glasses, and portable cd/mp3 players (The program uses digital recordings to increase acess to literacy classes. 
-Part of what we pay to participate in the Literacy Brigade will also help fund more local grassroots community organizing in El Salvador.
For more information on the cost and CISPES as an organization, visit the Cispes website:

The Impact
In El Salvador, 18% of citizens over the of age 15 – 690,000 people - can not read or write, with significantly higher illiteracy rates among women than men. In 2009, the new Ministry of Education began the National Literacy Program with the goal of reducing illiteracy by 4% over 5 years, as a stepping stone towards 0% illiteracy by 2021. In a dramatic departure from previous administration's nominal education investment, the budget for the Literacy Program was increased 10-fold in 2009 – from less than $4 million to $40 million dollars  - to jumpstart this immense national effort. Since then, over 100,000 people have been taught to read and write through 15,000 volunteer-led literacy circles across the nation, using innovative curriculum that relies on both in-person teachers and lessons aired by community radio stations. About 14,000 Salvadoran students and community members have volunteered their time to contribute to this enormous, concerted effort against illiteracy to date.
En El Salvador, 18% de los ciudadanos sobre la edad de 15 – 690.000 personas – no pueden leer ni escribir, con índices más altos para las mujeres que para los hombres.  En el 2009, el nuevo Ministro de Educación comenzó un Programa Nacional de Alfabetización con la meta de reducir el analfabetismo por 4% entre cinco anos, como un paso primero hacia 0% de analfabetismo en el 2021.  Con la nueva orientación del gobierno,  el presupuesto del Programa de Alfabetización ahora es 10 veces más grande que los presupuestos de los gobiernos anteriores, de menos de $4 millones antes de 2009 a $40 millones actualmente -para lanzar este gran esfuerzo nacional.  Desde 2009, más de 100.000 personas han aprendido leer y escribir a través de 15.000 círculos comunitarios dirigidos por voluntarios en muchas zonas del país. Se usa un currículo innovador que depende de clases con maestro/s tal como clases transmitidas por las estaciones de radios comunitarios.  Hasta la fecha, cerca de 14.000 estudiantes universitarios/as s y otros/as miembros de la comunidad han ofrecido su tiempo para contribuir a este esfuerzo enorme contra el analfabetismo.

</div></div>","Who are Welcome To My Yard?
Welcome To My Yard is an innovative not
for profit social enterprise working with street children and young people in Kathmandu, Nepal, providing holistic community based support, education, training, and income generation
programmes. We hope that through
our dedication and creative approaches to involve and inspire young people we
will have a positive social impact in the community as well as provide an
unforgettable experience for our customers through our not for profit business projects.
 
Supporting street children and young people
We are working with a street community of children and young
people in Kathmandu Nepal. This community is built up of children, young people and
families that either live on the street or have basic shelter and are forced into
street life and working. They age from 2-25 both girls and boys. 
What we need to start the young people's project?
We need a project work space in the heart of this street community. This will become a safe contact point in which children and
young people can come and get to know us, receive support and get into our programme which helps them with work experience, vocational
training and education opportunities. The project space will run the innovative
bite size workshops, kids clubs and young people's
groups and provide a place for our key workers to provide emotional support 1:1
with young people. 
The Art Space
As
part of our strengths based work and encouraging children and young people's
creativity, we want to dedicate entire walls of our building just for them. Young people as individuals or groups will
have the opportunity to use this space to express themselves in any way they
like; murals, photographs, paintings and more! We will then exhibit their
work for 2-3 months and invite local people and tourists to come and see what they
have created. Then, we will white wash and start all over again! We will
encourage local art students and artists to come and work with the children and
young people to hone their skills and develop their abilities to put their
imaginations into colour and materials.
What will your funds cover?
Your
funds will pay for the project space and bills for one year; provide basic
equipment for the office, purchase art materials and provide lighting for the
art space. We need to keep fundraising in order to fulfill all the aspects of the project we need, but these funds will enable us to get running! If we raise over this amount  we will put it towards other
items needed for the project such as resources and much needed basic salaries for team.  

::DON'T FORGET:: you don't need to be alone in getting together your donation. As we are a UK registered Community Interest Company you are perfectly entitled to get together with a group of friends or colleagues and do a fun fundraising event or activity to raise the donation as a group!:: See our website for some ideas of what you could do.

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Greetings and thank you for taking the time to look at my campaign! First some background, I have been teaching yoga and meditation here in Madison since 2004 and have been an avid student and practitioner since 1999.  I have taught to a broad range of individuals, from kids to police officers to pregnant mothers, and in a variety of settings, such as hospitals, colleges, and studios. My enthusiasm for yoga's (from here used to connote meditation as well) effects on health and overall wellbeing only grows.  There is a lot of yoga available today, more than at any time in its 5000 year history, and in this country the focus tends to be on increasing strength and flexibility. But let's be clear, whereas I love the freedom in my back when I'm regularly opening my hamstrings, my passion surrounds the larger picture of what yoga can offer--how to make one's life better irrespective of how flexible you are or how old you are.  If you can breathe, you can do yoga. As a system, yoga has lots of techniques, some body oriented and some not, to increase energy, mental clarity <em>and </em>stability, and to connect with our heart's longing for a life that is meaningful and reflects our unique talents.  This is the yoga I am committed to sharing.  In 2007 I met my teacher, Rod Stryker of ParaYoga, who has condensed the best of yoga into a system that makes this greater scope accessible to the modern individual and in terms that are relevant to our times, without losing any of yoga's original integrity.  ParaYoga specializes in working with people one on one, which is how most of yoga has been imparted throughout its history. By crafting a personal practice that takes into account the current conditions and circumstances of the individual and then matching what techniques best suit his/her desired outcome, yoga's sophistication as a holistic tool for healing and positive development is fully utilized. Whether the desired outcome is better rest, support and growth through a tough time (such as divorce, addiction recovery, or job loss), or spiritual deepening, yoga can address any of this- more than health in just physical terms.  My understanding as a student and skill set as a teacher of this vast science has grown immensely since studying ParaYoga.</p>
<p>So this is where the project comes to life.  In January there is an event in India, called the Kumbha Mela, which for millenia takes place every 12 years. It is the largest gathering of yogi's on the planet (as well as folks of many spiritual paths and traditions) and is a super conference of sorts for deepening personal practice and learning from the high caliber of teachers present who have much to share regarding yoga techniques and philosophy and the wisdom on how to best incorporate this information for accelerated growth.  My teacher and his teacher, Pandit Rajmani Tigunait, of the Pennsylvania based Himalayan Institute are hosting a three week trip to India in Allahabad, site of the Himalayan Institute's Indian campus, and 2 miles from the epicenter of the Kumbha Mela.  I will be joining many dedicated students and sharing in the opportunity to learn from and accompany these two masters to the home of these teachings.  </p>
<p>For me this trip is an extraordinary opportunity to walk the land where these teachings came to life, to glean from the knowledge and wisdom of these two renowned teachers, deepen my practice, and expand my understanding of yoga. My ultimate intention in all of this is to then bring this knowledge home to better serve my students and my community.  There are moments in life when the invitation to step out of the day to day reality and be a part of something much larger than ourselves comes.  This moment has arrived and I don't want to miss it!</p>
<p>I raise two young girls with my husband and what I make from teaching yoga is enough for our household needs, but not for this epic excursion.  I am asking for support from friends, family, and the greater community the make my dream a reality without sinking my family into debt.</p>
<h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is a tall order I realize, and $5000 is no small change.  This is the cost of the excursion that is being offered by the Himalayan Institute of which my teacher is affilliated. Specifically this covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airfare getting to and from India</li>
<li>The three weeks of lodging at the Himalayan Institute's Allahabad campus and HI lodging in Khajuraho </li>
<li>The food being served at both of these locations </li>
</ul>
<p>Any funding that exceeds the $5000 (a girl can dream!!) will go towards spreading the best of yoga here at home by updating my website, creating fresh marketing materials, and all the business stuff that goes into this line of work.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I'm not asking for handouts here and have a great many perks to offer if you choose to take advantage, so take a look.  By the way, I also work as a photographer (and plan to document my travels to Kumbha Mela) so if you're into supporting me but are not keen on practicing yoga, there are some photography perks that may appeal to you.  If you live outside of the Southern Wisconsin region but would like to work together through one on one yoga guidance, I serve clients through phone/Skype consultations and video record practices and share via YouTube.  Anyone from my homeland of Michigan- we can arrange to meet next time I'm there visiting family.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have the means to contribute, you can still help! The success of all of these home grown campaigns depends on word of mouth. Talking about this project and sharing the link via facebook and e-mail is a huge source of support for me and you have my utmost gratitude for spreading the word.  Thank you!!!</p>

Although the garden’s rustic setting -- with the beds nestled among the trees and the brush -- is beautiful, it has also turned out to be impractical: the garden is over 500 feet from the school building, where there is no water source, no space for expansion, no protection from crop damage by wild animals, no visibility from the school and, in the summer months, an insect infestation made it impossible to stand in the garden for more than five minutes without being coated in bug bites. It became clear that the existing beds need to be moved closer to the school in order to create a manageable, expandable and sustainable garden project. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The move will greatly enhance students exposure to the garden, and make it an accessible resource for hands-on learning across all grades and subjects.

How We are Going the Extra “Kilometer” 
We are going as a part of Zaya.org which is a non-profit specializing education technology.

This approach allows students to access educational content and for teacher to track their progress even if there is no internet access or electrical power. 
 
The Support We Need 
This epic journey  will take us 15,000 kilometers from London to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. We are asking for just $1 per kilometer to help on items such as:  

- The “Hotspots” going into the schools and orphanages

<p>Hello everyone my name is Rusty and I am a very proud father of an amazing autistic little boy name Gavin. When Gavin was only 2 years old his mother and I began to notice he was different. Long story short we took him to Akron Children's Hospital for an evaluation by a neurologist and he was immediately diagnosed with autism.</p>
<p>Both his mother and I feel very blessed to have such a special little boy. We agree that his autism has made him unique and defines him as an extraordinary human being. In spite of this it is still quiet difficult to communicate with him. Gavin can speak some words but for the most part he is non-verbal.</p>
<p>Monday through Friday Gavin goes to school with other young children like him with special needs. Over the summer when he was not in school he was going to a speech therapist once a week. Last time he was there his speech therapist showed me some of the activities he was doing with an Apple iPad. Gavin was doing things on the iPad I had never seen him do before.</p>
<p>Since then I have researched the benefits of using an iPad to help autistic children learn and communicate. I have found numerous web sites and videos showing how iPads are helping autistic children everywhere. Click on this link to learn more!</p>

<p>Gavin’s mother and I are asking for donations to buy Gavin and iPad. With an iPad he will have a voice and be able to show us what is on his mind. We will also be able to communicate with him on a level that he will be able to understand. It would be the perfect teaching tool!</p>

New York Cares was founded by a group of friends, who wanted to
take action against serious social issues that faced our city in the late
1980s. Finding few options to help, they created their own organization to
address the problems from the ground up. New York Cares is now the city's
largest volunteer management organization, running volunteer programs for 1,300
nonprofits, city agencies, and public schools.

As I hope to get my graduate degree in linguistics in the future, this semester abroad will help me to grow as a linguist and improve my language skills across the board.

There are several scholarships from Texas Tech and within the Spanish department I'll be applying for to help fund the trip as well.</p>
<p>The cost comes from a laundry list of fees required to be paid, as well as a few other in-country and pre-travel expenses.

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This semester in Spain will give me 15 credit hours toward my major in Spanish, a feat that can't be achieved in a single semester at Texas Tech (as five Spanish classes cannot be taken simultaneously in a semester). After finishing a semester abroad, I'll effectively be finished with my undergraduate degree (with the exception of a couple of credits to be taken in a summer semester) and be ready to move on to graduate school - a whole separate issue. </p>
<p>I'm proud to say that I'll be finishing my undergraduate degree so quickly, especially having only started my time in college a year ago.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Dear Friends,</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to learn
more about the ongoing restoration efforts for LIRR #39.  While the Railroad Museum of Long Island is
excited about the progress we are making in terms of fundraising, we recognize
that this is an effort both driven by your generosity, and intended for your
enjoyment.  With that in mind, we are
always looking for new ways to not only raise the funds necessary to complete
the restoration, but also to ensure the ability of our contributors to enjoy
the fruits of their generosity.</p>
<p>For all who are unfamiliar with the locomotive, here is a
brief history.  #39 is one of 31 4-6-0 G5s
class locomotives built by the Pennsylvania Railroad’s Juniata Shops for operation
on the Long Island Railroad, which was operated by the PRR at the time.  The class was designed to meet the unique
demands of suburban commuter operations, which required both significant
tractive effort and acceleration capabilities. 
#39 was built in 1929, and was among the last steam locomotives
remaining in service on Long Island when the process of full dieselization was
completed in 1955.  Along with #35, which
also survives, #39 participated in the railroad’s “Operation:  Changeover” ceremony in October of 1955.</p>
<p>Upon her retirement, #39 was displayed at the Carriage House
Museum in Stony Brook.  In 1980, the
locomotive was removed from display and moved to Riverhead in preparation for
an operational restoration.  After three
decades of struggles involving funding and logistics, the decision was made to
negotiate an agreement with the Strasburg Railroad, who was already handling
the contract work on the boiler at the time.</p>
<p>The current agreement between RMLI and the Strasburg
Railroad will see the locomotive placed into operation within three years of
successful fundraising from RMLI.  The
Strasburg Railroad will contribute more than $1 million to the project, with
RMLI responsible for the other $1 million. 
While Strasburg has this sum of money readily available, our museum does
not…and that’s where we need your help!</p>
<p>A successful return to operation would be highly significant
to the worlds of steam preservation, Long Island history, and Pennsylvania
heritage.  The locomotive would hold such
distinctions as the largest operational 4-6-0 locomotive in the world, the only
operational Belpaire firebox in the US, and one of only two operational PRR-built
locomotives at the present time.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the agreement with the Strasburg
Railroad in March of 2013, our fundraising efforts to date now total over
$119,000.  Added on to the Strasburg
Railroad’s portion of the funding, we are now well over halfway to finally
making this decades-long dream a reality. It is our hope that you will continue to
support the project, and allow us to give this beautiful piece of history the
treatment that she deserves.</p>
<p>We strive for transparency in our fundraising efforts.  All documents relating to the project, including the lease agreement, scope of work, and restoration contract, can be found here <a href=""http://www.rmli.us/RMLI/Documents.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.rmli.us/RMLI/Documents.html</a>  If you are still unsure of anything, please do not hesitate to contact any of us, we'll be happy to speak with you!</p>

always looking for new ways to not only raise the funds necessary to complete
the restoration, but also to ensure the ability of our contributors to enjoy
the fruits of their generosity.
For all who are unfamiliar with the locomotive, here is a
brief history.  #39 is one of 31 4-6-0 G5s
class locomotives built by the Pennsylvania Railroad’s Juniata Shops for operation
on the Long Island Railroad, which was operated by the PRR at the time.  The class was designed to meet the unique
demands of suburban commuter operations, which required both significant
tractive effort and acceleration capabilities. 
#39 was built in 1929, and was among the last steam locomotives
remaining in service on Long Island when the process of full dieselization was
completed in 1955.  Along with #35, which
also survives, #39 participated in the railroad’s “Operation:  Changeover” ceremony in October of 1955.
Upon her retirement, #39 was displayed at the Carriage House
Museum in Stony Brook.  In 1980, the
locomotive was removed from display and moved to Riverhead in preparation for
an operational restoration.  After three
decades of struggles involving funding and logistics, the decision was made to
negotiate an agreement with the Strasburg Railroad, who was already handling
the contract work on the boiler at the time.
The current agreement between RMLI and the Strasburg
Railroad will see the locomotive placed into operation within three years of
successful fundraising from RMLI.  The
Strasburg Railroad will contribute more than $1 million to the project, with
RMLI responsible for the other $1 million. 
While Strasburg has this sum of money readily available, our museum does
not…and that’s where we need your help!
A successful return to operation would be highly significant
to the worlds of steam preservation, Long Island history, and Pennsylvania
heritage.  The locomotive would hold such
distinctions as the largest operational 4-6-0 locomotive in the world, the only
operational Belpaire firebox in the US, and one of only two operational PRR-built
locomotives at the present time.
Since the announcement of the agreement with the Strasburg
Railroad in March of 2013, our fundraising efforts to date now total over
$119,000.  Added on to the Strasburg
Railroad’s portion of the funding, we are now well over halfway to finally
making this decades-long dream a reality. It is our hope that you will continue to
support the project, and allow us to give this beautiful piece of history the
treatment that she deserves.
We strive for transparency in our fundraising efforts.  All documents relating to the project, including the lease agreement, scope of work, and restoration contract, can be found here http://www.rmli.us/RMLI/Documents.html  If you are still unsure of anything, please do not hesitate to contact any of us, we'll be happy to speak with you!

<p>The Academy of Historical Arts has offered to provide a home for the collection in its full time training venue, The Vanguard Centre, but Triquetra will need to make some improvements to the environment in the facility to make it suitable for storing antiques. This is where we need your help!</p>
<p><strong><u>What We Need</u></strong></p>
<p>Help us develop sustainable atmospheric controls for the storage and protection of the Triquetra Collection. With your help we can manage the storage environment for the collection, which will allow us not only to preserve it further, but also to display it more actively and make it more accessible.</p>
<p>Our goal with this project is to install industrial dehumidifiers, temperature regulators, and a secure storage locker for the collection so it can continue to grow and so that we can begin to be bring it out for handling sessions more regularly.</p>
<p>The cost of the equipment for basic atmospheric controls and initial storage expenses is £1000. If we are able to raise this sum, we can make The Vanguard Centre into a suitable long-term home for the collection.</p>
<p><strong><u>Stretch Goals </u></strong></p>
<p>If we are able to raise £1500, we will be able to purchase a custom storage solution to secure the collection while not on display.</p>
<p>If we can raise £2500, we will be able to install a full time custom display case in The Vanguard Centre, where different items from the collection can go on display, allowing more people the opportunity to view and learn about the items in the collection.</p>
<p>If we can raise £6000, we will be able to install a mezzanine in The Vanguard Centre and build a set of custom display cases so that the whole collection is on full time display. This is our end goal for the collection and we hope that eventually The Vanguard Centre will have a small museum dedicated to the Triquetra Collection, making the various pieces accessible to the public and wider community.</p>
<p>Beyond this, we will put the money towards further expanding the collection and making more pieces available for study and furthering understanding of the Historical European Martial Arts. All arms acquired will be identified and photographed for inclusion in the collection’s website, and all books will have facsimiles created and made available to the community through Fallen Rook Publishing.</p>
<p><strong><u>Perks</u></strong></p>
<p>As a charity with (very!) limited sources of funding, we do not have the ability to offer a great deal of perks, but we would like to thank those who contribute to the campaign. Therefore, with the help of our corporate sponsors (the Academy of Historical Arts and Fallen Rook Publishing), we have managed to secure the following perks for those who help with this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>£10 (your name will go into the Triquetra Collection Supporters page on the website as thanks)</li>
<li>£15 (thanks and a postcard of the collection)</li>
<li>£25 (thanks and an AHA patch, with free postage)</li>
<li>£50 (thanks, a patch and a free copy of the upcoming Fallen Rook Publishing facsimile of the original 1840 martial arts book by Donald Walker that is held in the Triquetra Collection, with free postage)</li>
<li>£75 (thanks and two hours of private HEMA or archery tuition at The Vanguard Centre)</li>
<li>£100 (thanks and free attendance in a month’s worth of drop-in sessions at The Vanguard Centre)</li>
<li>£250 (thanks and private handling session for you and up to 4 friends at The Vanguard Centre)</li>

<p><strong><u>Risks and Challenges for the Project</u></strong></p>
<p>The largest risk for this project is us failing to achieve our initial goal but any help we receive will lay the groundwork if we need to proceed with further fundraising. The project will be brought to a successful completion one way or another, but assistance from this fundraising campaign will bring us to success more swiftly.</p>
<p><strong><u>About the Team</u></strong></p>
<p>Trustees Ben Kerr and Keith Farrell are leading this project. They have previous experience with Indiegogo crowdfunding campaigns, having led the highly successful campaign to “Purchase the 1798 Copy of Roworth’s ‘The Art of Defence on Foot’” in the summer of 2014. That campaign raised £2125 (386% of its £550 original goal) from 89 backers. Within five months all perks had been delivered and the project brought to completion.</p>
<p>The Triquetra Services (Scotland) charitable organisation has the benefit of having both a Senior Librarian and the Curator of Arms and Armour at the Glasgow Museums on the board of trustees to ensure that the collection is well looked after and properly maintained. Further individuals offer knowledge, advice and professional skills to the board of trustees.</p>
<p>Our first corporate sponsor, the Academy of Historical Arts, exists to promote the study of history through the medium of the historical, martial and creative arts. We are an umbrella organisation to coordinate and aid the research and practices undertaken by our component groups and societies. Our belief is that if many like-minded groups work together towards a common goal then the end result is so much greater than if every group tries to work alone.</p>
<p>Our second corporate sponsor, Fallen Rook Publishing, is a company based in Scotland that has a strong interest in helping the international HEMA community grow and develop, supporting practitioners, instructors and events with scholarly books, facsimiles and reproductions of both historical fencing treatises and contextual history books.</p>
<p><strong><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></strong></p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially then please spread the word. If the international HEMA community comes together to help then we will be able to provide a safe and secure long-term home for our charity’s growing collection of antiques and to make it even more accessible to the community in the future.

</div></div>","The Academy of Historical Arts has offered to provide a home for the collection in its full time training venue, The Vanguard Centre, but Triquetra will need to make some improvements to the environment in the facility to make it suitable for storing antiques. This is where we need your help!
What We Need
Help us develop sustainable atmospheric controls for the storage and protection of the Triquetra Collection. With your help we can manage the storage environment for the collection, which will allow us not only to preserve it further, but also to display it more actively and make it more accessible.
Our goal with this project is to install industrial dehumidifiers, temperature regulators, and a secure storage locker for the collection so it can continue to grow and so that we can begin to be bring it out for handling sessions more regularly.
The cost of the equipment for basic atmospheric controls and initial storage expenses is £1000. If we are able to raise this sum, we can make The Vanguard Centre into a suitable long-term home for the collection.
Stretch Goals 
If we are able to raise £1500, we will be able to purchase a custom storage solution to secure the collection while not on display.
If we can raise £2500, we will be able to install a full time custom display case in The Vanguard Centre, where different items from the collection can go on display, allowing more people the opportunity to view and learn about the items in the collection.
If we can raise £6000, we will be able to install a mezzanine in The Vanguard Centre and build a set of custom display cases so that the whole collection is on full time display. This is our end goal for the collection and we hope that eventually The Vanguard Centre will have a small museum dedicated to the Triquetra Collection, making the various pieces accessible to the public and wider community.
Beyond this, we will put the money towards further expanding the collection and making more pieces available for study and furthering understanding of the Historical European Martial Arts. All arms acquired will be identified and photographed for inclusion in the collection’s website, and all books will have facsimiles created and made available to the community through Fallen Rook Publishing.
Perks
As a charity with (very!) limited sources of funding, we do not have the ability to offer a great deal of perks, but we would like to thank those who contribute to the campaign. Therefore, with the help of our corporate sponsors (the Academy of Historical Arts and Fallen Rook Publishing), we have managed to secure the following perks for those who help with this project:

£10 (your name will go into the Triquetra Collection Supporters page on the website as thanks)
£15 (thanks and a postcard of the collection)
£25 (thanks and an AHA patch, with free postage)
£50 (thanks, a patch and a free copy of the upcoming Fallen Rook Publishing facsimile of the original 1840 martial arts book by Donald Walker that is held in the Triquetra Collection, with free postage)
£75 (thanks and two hours of private HEMA or archery tuition at The Vanguard Centre)
£100 (thanks and free attendance in a month’s worth of drop-in sessions at The Vanguard Centre)
£250 (thanks and private handling session for you and up to 4 friends at The Vanguard Centre)
£750 (thanks and a weekend seminar for your club with Keith Farrell, with only travelling expenses and accommodation to be paid or otherwise arranged)
£1000 (thanks and a printed and hand bound reproduction of McBane’s book “The Expert Sword-Man’s Companion”, along with a copy of the entire Fallen Rook Publishing catalogue to date, and a first edition copy of each of the next 5 books  that come into print through Fallen Rook Publishing, with free postage)

<p><strong>A NEW OPPORTUNITY KNOCKING ON MY DOOR</strong><br/><br/>One morning, on my way to class, I checked my email to see if there was any news from any of the masters programs I have applied (since I applied for six masters). To my surprise, I found an email from the best business school in Norway (my first option), BI NORWEGIAN BUSINESS SCHOOL!, not only did I get accepted to the top 8th marketing master's program in Europe, but also I got a scholarship, covering tuition fees and part of living expenses!!!

It takes a 1500-km route through Switzerland and France, from Lausanne to Mont Saint-Michel. The project aims to take a new look at the medieval heritage of France and Switzerland, from a point of view that a university education doesn’t usually provide. Eleven university students walk along medieval pilgrim routes, with 3-week stops at various important centers of monastic culture: Sainte-Foy de Conques, Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire and Mont-Saint-Michel in Normandy.Our aim is to open the topic of art and medieval pilgrimage to a wider public. Also, we want to bring a new element to university education – the university not only as a place to receive theoretical information, but as a directly experienced practice.Our project was made possible thanks to the support of many people and institutions. At the moment, the Migrating Art Historians have already walked 1,012 km and have completed a three-week stay in the Conques Abbey in southern France, where a one-week course featuring prominent world medievalists (Hans Belting, Sible de Blaauw, Cynthia Hahn) took place. Their lectures are available online for free.  In addition to the interest of scholars and the media, the project has been accompanied by the exceptional generosity of the people the students have met along their journey. They have become acquainted with France, where it is common to accept twelve pilgrims, feed them and offer them beds in the privacy of a home. The media shows us a France affected by an aggressive election campaign of the last weeks. But the Migrating Art Historians have primarily come across unbelievable manifestations of solidarity.    The goal of this project is to share these scientific and human experiences.Therefore, starting from April 27 you can watch a new short documentary movie produced by us every week (here). These movies will introduce the phenomenon of pilgrimage in its different aspects. They will focus, for example, on the important role of light and time in the life of a pilgrim and in a sacred space, or romantic ideas of the Middle Ages, but will also present the daily routine of pilgrims, their food or the unexpected twists they encounter on their way. Watch our first movie devoted to pilgrimages across religions: However, we need additional funding to create all the planned films. The dramaturgy, screenplays, and camerawork are the work of the students / pilgrims themselves. However, for the best films to be made, the complete team includes professional editors and Czech and French actors who narrate the films with their voices. The calculated costs of this work is $6800. At the moment, we are able to cover the expenses for the first three movies. The amount requested is therefore $5100.  One of our most important goals is the production of a unique book in English and French. Students would be involved with the world's leading experts for its content. Graphic design will be done by talented designers working at the Center for Early Medieval Studies, who have already produced several award-winning publications.The expenses necessary for the completion of this high-quality book are $2400 for graphic design, $3800 for the proofreading of students’ texts, $2000 for image copyrights, $3200 for editors and $9700 for printing. These costs will be partly covered by the Masaryk University, which provided us with an amount of $2400, designated for printing of the book. The Center for Early Medieval Studies will cover the proofreading and graphic design. The amount for the book desired to achieve is therefore $12500.   If you want to learn more about the participants, see our web site. ***« Historiens de l’art migrateurs » prêts à partir Le projet « Historiens de l’art migrateurs » est une expérience pédagogique et scientifique, sous forme d’un pèlerinage de 4 mois. Il compte 1’500 km à travers la Suisse et la France, de Lausanne au Mont-Saint-Michel. Ce projet a pour but d’élaborer un nouveau regard sur l’héritage  médiéval de France et de Suisse, d’un point de vue inhabituel pour l’éducation universitaire. Onze étudiants universitaires vont emprunter les chemins de pèlerins médiévaux, avec trois arrêts dans des centres importants de culture monastique : Sainte-Foy de Conques, Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire et le Mont-Saint-Michel en Normandie.  Notre but est d’ouvrir le champ de l’art et du pèlerinage médiéval à un public plus large. Nous voulons également introduire une nouvelle approche au sein de l’éducation universitaire – l’université non seulement comme un lieu où on reçoit l’information théorique, mais également où on pratique des expériences pratiques.Notre projet a pu être réalisé grâce à l’aide de nombreuses personnes et institutions. Actuellement, les historiens de l’art migrateurs ont parcouru 1012 km et ont achevé un séjour de trois semaines à l’abbaye de Conques au sud de la France, où a eu lieu un cours d’une semaine avec la participation d’importants médiévistes mondiaux (Hans Belting, Sible de Blaauw, Cynthia Hahn). Leur cours sont disponibles gratuitement en ligne.  En plus de l’intérêt des chercheurs et des média, le projet est soutenu par la générosité hors normes des gens que les étudiants rencontrent tout au long de leur chemin. Ils sont rentrés en contact avec une France où il est commun d’accepter douze pèlerins, de les nourrir et de leur offrir un lit dans le carde privé d’un foyer. Les media nous montre une France affectée par des campagnes électorales agressives des dernières semaines. Mais les historiens de l’art migrateurs sont principalement rentrés en contact avec des manifestations de solidarité incroyables. Les media nous montre une France affectée par des campagnes électorales agressives des dernières semaines. Mais les historiens de l’art migrateurs sont principalement rentrés en contact avec des manifestations de solidarité incroyables.   Le but de ce projet est de partager ces expériences humaines et scientifiques. De ce fait, à partir du 27 avril, tu peux regarder (ici), chaque semaine, un nouveau court documentaire de notre production. Ces films vont présenter le phénomène du pèlerinage et les pèlerinages sous différents aspects. Ils vont se focaliser, par exemple, sur le rôle important de la lumière ou du temps dans la vie du pèlerin et dans l’espace sacré, sur les idées romantiques du Moyen Âge, mais vont également présenter la routine quotidienne des pèlerins, leur façon de se nourrir ou des imprévus sur leur chemin. Regarde notre premier film dédié au pèlerinage à travers les religions: Toutefois, nous avons besoin de financements supplémentaires pour créer tous les films. La dramaturgie, les scénarios, et le tournage sont le travail des étudiants/pèlerins eux-mêmes. Cependant, pour que les films soient de qualité, l’équipe comprend aussi des éditeurs professionnels ainsi que des acteurs tchèques et français qui prêtent leurs voix aux films. Les coûts de leur travail s’élèvent à 6’800$. À présent nous sommes capables de couvrir les frais des trois premiers films, mais la somme requise est de 5’100$.  Un de nos buts primordiaux est la réalisation d’un livre unique en anglais et français. Son contenu sera produit par les étudiants et par les principaux experts mondiaux. La conception graphique sera réalisée par les concepteurs talentueux travaillant dans le Centre d’études médiévales, qui sont à l’origine de publication récompensées par des prix.La somme finale pour achever un livre de haute qualité est de 2’400$ pour la conception graphique, de 3’800$ pour la relecture des textes d’étudiants, de 2’000$ pour les droits d’auteur des reproductions, de 3’200$ pour les éditeurs et de 9’700$ pour l’impression. Les coûts seront en partie couverts par l’Université Masaryk, qui nous a donné la somme de 2’400$ pour l’impression du livre. Le Centre d’études médiévales va couvrir les coûts de la relecture et de la conception graphique. Ainsi, la somme totale requise est de 12’500$.   Si tu veux apprendre plus des participants va voir notre site web. *** “Stěhovaví historici umění” na cestěProjekt „Stěhovaví historici umění“ je pedagogickým a vědeckým experimentem, který má podobu čtyřměsíční poutě. Ta zahrnuje celkem 1500 km pěší poutě napříč Švýcarskem a Francií, z Lausanne do Mont Saint-Michel. Tento projekt si klade za cíl zkoumat středověké dědictví Francie a Švýcarska z úhlu pohledu, který běžné vysokoškolské studium neposkytuje. Jedenáct studentů při své výpravě následuje středověké poutnické cesty, přičemž se postupně zastaví ve třech významných centrech klášterní kultury: Sainte-Foy v Conques, Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire a Mont-Saint-Michel v Normandii.Naším cílem je otevřít širokému publiku téma umění a středověkého poutnictví. Chceme ale také přinést nový prvek do univerzitního vzdělávání – univerzita ne pouze jako místo přijímaní teoretických informací, ale jako přímo prožitá zkušenost. Náš projekt mohl být zrealizován díky podpoře mnoha lidí a institucí. V tuto chvíli mají „Stěhovaví historici umění“ za sebou 1012 km pěší chůze a třítýdenní pobyt v opatství v Conques na jihu Francie, kde proběhl týdenní workshop za účasti předních světových medievistů (Hans Belting, Sible de Blaauw, Cynthia Hahn). Jejich přednášky jsou zdarma dostupné na internetu.  Kromě zájmu badatelů a médií je celý projekt provázen výjimečnou štědrostí lidí, které studenti na své cestě potkávají. Přichází tak do kontaktu s prostředím Francie, kde je běžné přijmout dvanáct poutníků, nasytit je a poskytnout jim přístřeší. Média nám ukazují Francii zachvácenou agresivní předvolební kampaní posledních týdnů. Stěhovaví historici umění se však setkávají především s neuvěřitelnou vlnou solidarity.   Cílem celého projektu je sdílet tyto vědecké i lidské zážitky.Proto od 27. dubna můžete každý týden sledovat nový krátkometrážní dokumentární film z naší produkce (zde). Tyto filmy představí fenomén poutě a poutnictví v nejrůznějších podobách. Zaměří se např. na důležitou roli světla nebo času v životě poutníka a v posvátném prostoru, romantické představy o středověku, ale ukážou Vám i denní rutinu poutníků, jejich stravování či nečekané zvraty na jejich cestě. Podívejte se na náš první film věnovaný poutím napříč náboženstvími:   Na tvorbu všech plánovaných filmů však potřebujeme další finanční prostředky.  Dramaturgie, scénáře a kamera jsou prací samotných studentů/poutníků. Aby však výsledné filmy byly co nejkvalitnější, součástí celého týmu jsou i profesionální střihači a čeští a francouzští herci, kteří svými hlasy filmy doprovázejí. Vyčíslené náklady na jejich práci jsou 6800 $. V tuto chvíli jsme schopní pokrýt náklady na první tři filmy. Částka, kterou si přejeme získat je tedy 5100 $.  Jedním z našich nejdůležitějších cílů je vznik jedinečné knihy v angličtině a francouzštině. Na jejím obsahu se budou podílet studenti spolu s předními světovými odborníky. Grafického zpracování se ujmou talentovaní designeři působící v Centru raně středověkých studií, pod jejichž rukama vzniklo již několik oceňovaných publikací.Celkové náklady na realizaci takto kvalitní knihy jsou: 2400 $ na grafické zpracování, 1900 $ na jazykové korektury textů studentů, 2000 $ na autorská práva k reprodukcím, 3200 $ na redakci a 9700 $ na tisk.Tyto náklady částečně pokryjeme díky podpoře Masarykovy univerzity, která poskytne částku 2400 $ na tisk knihy. Centrum raně středověkých studií pak zaplatí náklady spojené s korekturami anglických a francouzských textů studentů a s prací grafiků. Částka, kterou bude nutné získat je tedy 12 500 $.   Chcete-li se dozvědět více o všech účastnících pochodu, navštivte naše webové stránky.*** “Migrating Art Historians” in cammino Il progetto ""Migrating Art Historians"" è un esperimento pedagogico e scientifico, che assume la forma di un pellegrinaggio della durata di 4 mesi. Si svolge lungo 1500 chilometri attraverso la Svizzera e la Francia, da Losanna a Mont Saint-Michel. Il progetto aspira a rivolgere uno sguardo di tipo nuovo sull’eredità artistica medievale di Francia e Svizzera. Un punto di vista che, di norma, la formazione universitaria non offre. Undici studenti universitari camminano lungo le rotte medievali di pellegrinaggio, effettuando soste di 3 settimane in alcuni significativi centri di cultura monastica: Sainte-Foy a Conques, Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire e Mont Saint-Michel in Normandia. Il nostro obiettivo è quello di comunicare a un più vasto pubblico argomenti inerenti all’arte e al pellegrinaggio medievale. Vogliamo inoltre apportare nuovi elementi alla formazione universitaria, intesa non solamente come luogo di apprendimento teorico ma anche quale fulcro di un’esperienza didattica da vivere in prima persona.Il nostro progetto ha potuto vedere la luce grazie al sostegno di tante persone e istituzioni. Al momento, gli Storici dell’Arte Migranti hanno già coperto 1012 chilometri di cammino e hanno terminato un soggiorno di tre settimane nell’abbazia di Conques, in Francia meridionale, dove sarà tenuto un corso di una settimana che vedrà la partecipazione di medievisti di fama mondiale (Hans Belting, Sible de Blaauw, Cynthia Hahn). Le loro lezioni saranno disponibili online gratuitamente.  Oltre all’interesse dimostrato dagli studiosi e dai media, il progetto nel suo insieme è accompagnato dalla eccezionale generosità che gli studenti incontrano durante il loro viaggio. Essi hanno avuto il loro incontro con la Francia, un paese dove è normale accogliere dodici pellegrini, dare loro da mangiare e offrire loro un posto per dormire nella privacy di una casa. I media, nelle ultime settimane, ci hanno mostrano una Francia caratterizzata da una campagna elettorale aggressiva. Ma gli Storici dell’Arte Migranti hanno incontrato soprattutto incredibili manifestazioni di solidarietà.   Il principale obiettivo del progetto è quello di condividere queste esperienze scientifiche e umane.È per questo che, dal 27 aprile in poi, ogni settimana, potete guardare un nuovo documentario breve da noi prodotto (qui). Questi filmati costituiranno un’introduzione al fenomeno del pellegrinaggio e dei pellegrinaggi da molteplici punti di vista. Si incentreranno, per esempio, sul ruolo particolare e importante che la luce o il trascorrere del tempo nei luoghi sacri ha per il pellegrino; o, ancora, sull’ideale romantico del Medioevo. Essi daranno un’idea di quella che è la routine quotidiana dei pellegrini, del cibo di cui si nutrono o degli inaspettati colpi di scena che caratterizzano il loro viaggio. Guarda il nostro primo video dedicato ai pellegrinaggi nelle diverse religioni: Abbiamo però bisogno di ulteriori finanziamenti per girare tutti i filmati previsti.Sceneggiatura, scenografia e riprese video sono a cura degli stessi studenti/pellegrini. Tuttavia, per ottenere filmati di qualità migliore, il team include tecnici del montaggio professionisti e attori di lingua ceca e francese che doppiano i filmati con la loro voce. l costo preventivo della loro prestazione è di 6800 dollari. Fino a ora, siamo in grado di coprire le spese dei primi tre filmati, per i quale l’ammontare necessario è di 5100 dollari.  Uno dei nostri obiettivi più ambiziosi è quello di produrre un libro esclusivo in inglese e francese. In essa pubblicheranno gli studenti insieme con i maggiori esperti a livello mondiale. La grafica del volume sarà affidata agli abili designer del Center for Early Medieval Studies, già responsabili dell’editing di numerosi volumi oggetto di riconoscimenti e premi. Per la realizzazione di questo prestigioso volume avremmo bisogno di 2400 dollari per la grafica, 3800 dollari per la revisione degli elaborati degli studenti, nonché di 2000 dollari per il copyright delle illustrazioni, 3200 dollari per i curatori e 9700 dollari per la stampa. I costi verrano in parte coperti dalla Masaryk University, che ci ha già finanziato con 2400 dollari per la stampa del volume. Il Center for Early Medieval Studies coprirà invece i costi della revisione dei testi e della grafica. L’importo totale che desideriamo raggiungere diventa pertanto di 12500 dollari.   Se volete saperne di più sui partecipanti guardate il nostro sito web.",21.0,8,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My goal is to create one million musicians. Music has given me so much and youtube has created a platform for me to share that positivity and energy, but I want to make a real physical connection with people. The idea behind this tour is to visit different ukulele clubs, schools, home-schools, nursing homes, wherever there are people playing the Ukulele and help them learn the instrument and continue to grow both musically and personally. This entire tour will be turned into a documentary as well to help others, who didn't get to experience it first hand, the moral boost they need to go buy an instrument and learn it, something almost everyone has fantasized about at least one time in their lives. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have set my goal at 12,000 USD. The trip is an 7 week trip, which from the research that I have done, with renting a van or RV, will cost a little over 1300 a week for three people. These costs have been estimated based on personal experience of other travelers while considering the following expenses, transportation rental, fuel, propane, sleeping accommodation, food and drink, miscellaneous van supplies, mobile phone, activities and camping and cooking supplies. These costs have been estimated for three people as I will be traveling with two more, a bass player, and a singer/guitar player, both from Medellin, Colombia, were I currently reside. This will further the learning experience with a cultural musical exchange and provide more opportunities for learners to play with a variety of muscians. In addition the two will help me film, and drive, and in general keep the trip safer. These are rental calculations, ideally the indiegogo campaign will raise enough to buy a small work van and convert it into a travel van so this trip can be repeated without the necessity of such a substantial crowdfunding project in the future. This puts the trip at 9000 or so if we rent. I believe with an extra 3000, and the savings from the rent, a serviceable work van can be bought, which would be the ideal scenario, bringing the total to 12000. Any extra money will go directly to the project in terms of extra strings, picks and other musical equipment, such as amps or cables in addition to cameras and/or microphones to help with the documentary, lighting or other cultural opportunities. </p>
<h3><strong>What perks do you get for participating? </strong></h3>
<p>10 dollar donations will get their name in the credits of the final documentary that will be made about the trip. </p>
<p>50 dollar donations will get their name in the credits of the weekly videos produced on the road as well. </p>
<p>100 donations will get their name painted on the van on ""Door of Gratitude,"" as well as all previous benefits.</p>
<p>350 dollar donations will get you all the previous benefits, as well as choosing a song for us to cover and make a video of dedicated to you on the trip as well. </p>
<p>500 dollar donations will receive a hand signed Ukulele thanking them for the contribution they made in helping us create 1,000,000 muscians. </p>
<h3>What happens to the money if we don't reach the goal?</h3>
<p>The most important item is the van, if that is the only thing I am able afford is a van or RV rental, I will find a way to finance the rest of the trip. If I do not raise enough to buy a van, I will rent one, I am determined to do this, I see the benefits, I am passionate about it, I will help people learn how to play an instrument. I believe the time is now to do this project and I believe in the positive impact that it will have.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Eduction, as it pertains to art and music in the United States is in trouble. People are forgetting why it is so important, it is my goal to help remind them, to introduce music to a new generation and to help an older generation re-fall in love with their songs. The biggest impact will be with the people that we will directly teach, they will be the ones that will have the chance to put their hands on an instrument, ask questions, and feed their curiosity, but the impact is not limited to them. By documenting the process people will have a chance to show their communities the value of art and music education and use it as a tool to inspire local communities to invest in education. Additionally our youtube channel currently has over 450 free educational videos for people to learn. By documenting this process we will be reaching a larger demographic then we currently are, which are primarily music learners. We would like to reach a larger audience, or what I call ""potential learners"" which we are hoping to inspire to pick up an instrument as well, and if they chose to do so, they will have access the free education that we currently provide. </p>
<p>This is something I am looking to repeat, I will not be able to see the USA in one trip, but I may be able to see a large portion and buy purchasing a van I will be able to see another large portion and repeat the process at a later date, which some day I would like to repeat through Central and South America as well. That will be more likely if I am able to purchase the van as opposed to rent it, but we have to eat an elephant one bite at a time and it starts with this tour. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The largest challenge I see is gathering enough people to reach my goal of 50 students a week . To address that challenge I am currently working with my social networks to help locate ukulele clubs and small schools or groups of home schools that would be interested in participating in this education. I am confident through preperation and dialouge this problem can be avoided quite easily. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>All help is welcome and money isn't the only help! Other ways you can get involved. </p>
<ul>
<li>Old instrument in the house that you don't play anymore? Any instrument you want to donate will be passed on to a perspective student. </li>
<li>Know a school, church, homeschool or Ukulele club that wants to a do an Ukulele learning seminar? Seminars range from ""what the heck is this thing?!?"" to how to play with other bands, basic and advanced blues techniques, strumming techniques, easy through advanced songs, and everything in between. These can be catered to the learners needs. </li>
<li>Got a van? I know someone that needs one!</li>
<li>Share the campaign on your social media, help us get the word out.</li>
<li>Try Indiegogo share tools, that great for just that.</li>

Francis Graffeo, who has been with the school since 2005, is
the Executive Director of The Joy of Music School.  All of the teachers at the school are
volunteers who share their musical knowledge. To learn more about the faculty
and staff, click the link at the bottom of this page labeled About Us to visit
The Joy of Music School website. 
Our group, The Melody of Joy Group, values local youth,
music, and helping out the community.  We
need the help of supporters like you to fund our campaign! 
The Joy of Music School has communicated to us that they
need several things including new microphones, new instruments for the kids,
and new recording devices. We intend to help provide these items for them with
your help! Non-monetary donations are also accepted but must first be approved
by the school. 
Those who donate can receive some thank-you gifts based upon
the dollar amount donated. Those who donate five dollars will receive golf tees
and small trinkets from sponsors of The Joy of Music School. Those who donate $20
or more dollars to our cause will receive a Joy of Music School engraved holiday
ornament. The Melody of Joy Group will ship these items to you, free of charge.

To stay up to date on our current fundraising efforts, visit
our blog https://themelodyofjoyblog.wordpress.com/
where we will be posting dates of when we will be on The University of
Tennessee Knoxville  campus  to accept donations as well as general
information about our campaign. 
Thank you so much for your support of this life-changing
program!

We’re Pato from Argentina, a musician, teacher and dreamer. Vini from Brazil, an engineer who loves nature and teaching. And Jaime from Spain, a McGyver craftman-designer. Our destinies met when we were all traveling in New Zealand - and here we are turning our dream into reality together!Today we share the same profession: we are ""Musical Park"" makers. We travel to schools or orphanages to build creative, fun and interdisciplinary spaces together with the kids their communities. We create an outdoor space for learning while integrating with nature.""What?""Wait… let us tell you our purspose:
When we were traveling around the world we realised our planet needs help! We saw that a way to help was to learn how to communicate better with each other and to learn again how to use our natural resources. We saw that our children need a new approach on education. For these reasons, we have a new approach which proposes:
1. What?An experiential and exploratory education. 
2. Where?With wide spaces, without tables or chairs to limit the learning experience. Flexible outdoor spaces, surrounded by nature.
3. How?Focused to facilitate liberating experiences that connect ourselves to our emotions. Focused also on improving the communication in all its aspects, with one’s self, with our peers and within our communities.
""I still don't quite get it...""What do we do?
In simple terms, our mission is to facilitate the creation of sustainable, outdoor, creative, fun spaces, surrounded by nature. These spaces will be called Musical Parks!""And what is a Musical Park?""It’s an interdisciplinary classroom, a concert hall, a vegetable garden, an outdoor lab and above all a meeting point for the whole community. Amazing, isn't it?And the next step is to buildour first Musical Park! 
Guess where? In Africa!
Yes! We were invited to build at NGO Caring Africa's orphanage, in Moshi, a small town by the base of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. We’ll stay for three months in total to complete the project and run workshops for the kids. It’s an incredible Project that give children a new opportunity through music and art.

 ""Now I get it! But how do you do this?"" The project has 3 key phases:

OBSERVING, SKETCHING AND HANDS-ON!(Duration: 1 month)Observing: This phase involves observing and gathering information on local environment, the community and the children needs.
Sketching: The kids are the artists and the designers, and they will create and plan the Musical Park based on permaculture concepts that we’ll share.
Hands-on: We love to get our hands dirty with earth. We’ll start planting vegetables, flowers and medicinal plants, maintaining the local culture and resources.

COLLECTION AND BUILDING!(Duration: 1 month)Colletion: With our plan ready we start collecting rubbish and reciclables to create our musical instruments.
Building: Pure fun and musical learning while we use creativity to explore the world of sounds through the musical instruments crafting!

PLAY!(Duration: 1 month)Yes! This is the most important part, so and we reserve a whole month to use this newly created space for workshops, to learn, to have fun, to teach traditional subjects as well as other subjects such as communication, free expression, critical thinking, self-knowledge and community values!
 What do we leave in Tanzania apart from the Musical Park?

The experience of building with rubbish (Upcycling) and learning about permaculture building techniques.
The artistic and musical experience. The games, dances and music!
All the tools used to make the instruments and the Musical Park’s structure.
All teaching materials about recycling, gardening, building and how to use the Musical Park as a teaching space.

3. Como?Focada em criar experiências que nos liberem, nos conectem com as nossas emoções, enfatizando a comunicação saudável consigo, com seus pares e com a sua comunidade.
""Ainda não entendi...""Qual é a nossa proposta?
De forma super simples, nossa missão é facilitar a criação de espaços de ensino sustentáveis, criativos, divertidos, ao ar livre e em meio a natureza. Isso tudo formará o que chamamos de Parque Musical!""E o que é um Parque Musical?""É uma sala de aula de múltiplas disciplinas, um auditório musical, um jardim, um laboratorio ao ar livre e um ponto de encontro para a comunidade.Genial, né?!E agora vamos construir o primeiroParque Musical!
Adivinha onde? Na África!
Pois é! Nos convidaram para construir em um orfanato da ONG Caring Africa em Moshi, uma cidadezinha nos pés do Monte Kilimanjaro, na Tanzania, onde no total vamos ficar 3 meses!  É um projeto incrível que acolhe crianças órfãs e dão uma nova oportunidade através da música e da arte. 

 ""E como tudo isso será feito?"" Dividimos nosso projeto em três etapas:

BUSCA, DESENHO E MÃO NA MASSA!(Duração: 1 mês)Busca: Nessa etapa vamos observar a natureza e as necessidades daquelas crianças e da comunidade em que vivem.
Desenho: Aqui as crianças são os artistas e designers. Assim vão desenhar e planejar o Parque com conceitos naturais.
Mãos na massa: Adoramos sujar nossas mãos de terra. Assim, iniciaremos o plantio de vegetais, flores e plantas medicinais, valorizando os recursos e a cultura local.

COLETA, CONSTRUÇÃO!(Duração: 1 mês)Coleta: Com o desenho em mãos, partimos para a coleta de lixo e materiais recicláveis para criar os instrumentos musicais.
Construção: Pura diversão e aprendizado musical enquanto usamos a criatividade para explorar o mundo dos sons!

BRINCAR!(Duração: 1 mês)Sim! Isso é o mais importante e por isso reservamos 1 mês inteiro para usar todo o Parque como a nova sala de aula, para aprender divertindo-se tanto as matérias tradicionais como a comunicação, liberdade, pensamento crítico, autoconhecimento e comunidade!
 E o que vamos deixar na Tanzânia?

Toda a experiência e novas ideias de construir com materiais reciclados e com conceitos de  bio-construção.
A vivência artística e musical com muitas brincadeiras, danças e músicas.
Todas as ferramentas que usamos para construir.
Ferramentas didáticas sobre o uso do Parque como um espaço de aprendizagem.

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>This holiday season, we hope you consider giving the gift of a brighter future to a group of high-potential students from underserved communities in Minnesota. With your help, we can empower them to pursue their dreams of careers in tech.</p>
<p>Every year, our non-profit Silicon North Stars brings 16 eighth-graders out to Silicon Valley for a one-week tech camp. They tour major tech companies and learn the basics of entrepreneurship - so that they can enter high school with a vision for their future and a strong belief that they can achieve their dreams. </p>
<p>We're raising $5,000 in our holiday campaign to ensure these kids can participate in our program cost-free. This is our 6th year of Silicon North Stars. By the end of this campaign we'll have brought over 95 different students into the program.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the challenge we're trying to solve?</strong></p>
<p>For kids who come from underserved communities, imagining a career in technology can be tough. Role models are hard to find, and there’s no clear path to success in front of them. Yet at the same time, the tech industry desperately needs to diversify its workforce - studies show that the more diverse a company is, the better products it creates and the happier its workforce becomes. Talent is universal, but access to opportunity is not.</p>
<p>That’s where Silicon North Stars comes in. Each year, we take 16 students from underrepresented communities in Minnesota’s Twin Cities and bring them to California's Silicon Valley for a unique, one-week technology camp. They visit the campuses and meet with professionals from some of the world's most successful tech companies (Google, Facebook, YouTube, etc.), set goals during a career counseling session, and then create and pitch their own startup ideas to the Silicon Valley tech community. When they return to Minnesota, they engage in a series of regular ""Minnesota Meetups"" to connect with the Twin Cities tech community and stay connected to each other and the goals that they set on the trip. We're building a community that we believe will build the future of the tech community in Minnesota - and strengthen connections between the Midwest and Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>We’ve run Silicon North Stars for five years so far, and the students we’ve gotten to meet have been outstanding.
