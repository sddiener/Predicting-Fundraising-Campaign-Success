I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.” Isaiah 43:19</strong></p><p>Have you heard? Women in Malawi contribute about 70% of the labor force in smallholder agricultural sector. However, many of them drop out of school, are poor and subject to abuse such as forced early marriages and rape. Others are widowed through HIV/AIDS and left with children and no hope. This leaves many of them living in economic and social slavery. This tragedy happening to 52% of the population is not consistent with Malawi, known as <strong><i>""The Warm Heart of Africa.""</i></strong></p><p>Eunice, the founder of Zayane Creations, personally experienced this tragedy. At age 15, she was sexually abused and gave birth to her first child. She experienced rejection, shame and dropped out of school. Later, however, she was given an opportunity to continue education, become employed and learned skills including jewelry design.</p><p>She is now married to Sam, the company’s managing director, and have a second child. Her story inspired the couple and one other Malawian Evelyn, to start Zayane Creations. The company will produce and distribute jewelry and bags with packaging reminiscent of <strong><i>The Warm Heart of Africa</i></strong><i>.</i> The company's business model will give similar opportunities to vulnerable women.  </p><p>10 vulnerable women will initially be employed to create our products. By the end of the first year, these women will begin training 10 new women. In the next five years, we target to reach and train 400 women as well as give part of our company shares some of them for more economic empowerment.</p><p>The word “Zayane” means “<strong><i>to feel at home,</i></strong>” and is spoken by a person who is warmly welcoming someone into their home. Zayane Creations is desiring to not only empower the women economically and through skill development, but also to point them to the heavenly home through sharing of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and discipleship. </p><p>Partner with us in restoring <i>The Warm Heart of Africa</i> through one product at a time!</p><p><strong>PRESENT CONDITIONS</strong></p><p>Sam, Eunice and Eve are currently students at African Business Institute (ABI) in Uganda since January until December, 2017.

We come with an abundance of experience in different areas.</p><p>The Managing Director, Sam, has served for 21 years in Christian ministry; held key leadership positions; managed major local and international projects and is a board member to three reputable organizations. He holds a Bachelors degree in Biblical Studies and Mass Communication and an advanced diploma in Telecommunications Technology. He and his wife, Eunice, also managed a successful pre-school for 6 years. Currently, he is an adjunct lecturer in Christian Ministry at African Bible University in Uganda and at Bible College Berea in Blantyre, Malawi.</p><p>Eunice, the Operations and Human Resources Director is multi-skilled in jewelry making and other products. She has served disadvantaged women for the past 17 years and seen positive transformation in their lives. She has also worked in various local and international jobs for 22 years such as project and human resource management, administration, lecturing and managing street children. She hosts a number of radio and TV programs that focus on women and youth. She has also won various awards related to her skills. She is inspired by her own abuse story to make a difference in the lives of other women. Eunice holds a Bachelor’s degree in Social Science. Currently, she is working at African Business Institute (ABI) in Uganda as Administration Manager.</p><p>The Finance and Marketing Director, Evelyn Kachule comes to the team with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications and three years job experience as Finance and Administration Manager. She is also experienced in jewelry and bag making. Currently, she is working as an Online and Marketing Manager at ABI in Uganda.</p><p>We are currently pursuing a Post-graduate course in Business Administration at ABI in Uganda. Our combined skills and experiences will be particularly relevant to Zayane Creations. These will be fully utilized to relate with and equip vulnerable women to lead better lives and the company succeed to the glory of God and to the good of the communities.</p><p>The Zayane Creation team includes the following advisors and consultants:</p><ul>
<li>Deus Byebiroha, Consultant</li>
<li>Wilson Okot, Consultant.</li>
<li>Marcelo Vieira, (African Business Institute Director), Advisor.</li>
<li>Jun Shiomitsu, (African Business Institute President), Advisor.</li>
</ul><p>Within our limited time as students at ABI, we have tested our business model and skills through production and selling of products; to customers from Uganda, Malawi and 3 other countries.  During this testing phase Zayane Creations achieved tangible results from micro scales.  A shop at a nearby upmarket shopping mall has purchased and is selling Zayane Creations' products. The company has 17 pending orders from customers from USA, Brazil, Japan, Netherlands, Uganda and Malawi.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>We are aware that in life unexpected things; risks and challenges are inevitable. Zayane Creations will do everything in our power to ensure that we execute our business plan without being sidetracked by risks or challenges that may arise. As a team we are determined to face challenges head on and with the greatest transparency. We anticipate risks and challenges such as:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>New entrants </strong>- Zayane Creations will develop customer royalty and retention through maintenance of production of high quality, custom made products and appropriate customer care. The company will engage in continual research to maintain product innovation and relevance. </li>
<li>
<strong>Training of vulnerable women taking longer than planned</strong>. - Professional trainers will be engaged to have minimal training period and start production with the women by February 2018.</li>
<li>
<strong>Market penetration taking longer. </strong>- Zayane will market its products aggressively on line through our website; by word of mouth; partnering with relevant stakeholders; fliers’ distribution; selling at tourist destinations and exporting to foreign markets.</li>

I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.” Isaiah 43:19Have you heard? Women in Malawi contribute about 70% of the labor force in smallholder agricultural sector. However, many of them drop out of school, are poor and subject to abuse such as forced early marriages and rape. Others are widowed through HIV/AIDS and left with children and no hope. This leaves many of them living in economic and social slavery. This tragedy happening to 52% of the population is not consistent with Malawi, known as ""The Warm Heart of Africa.""Eunice, the founder of Zayane Creations, personally experienced this tragedy. At age 15, she was sexually abused and gave birth to her first child. She experienced rejection, shame and dropped out of school. Later, however, she was given an opportunity to continue education, become employed and learned skills including jewelry design.She is now married to Sam, the company’s managing director, and have a second child. Her story inspired the couple and one other Malawian Evelyn, to start Zayane Creations. The company will produce and distribute jewelry and bags with packaging reminiscent of The Warm Heart of Africa. The company's business model will give similar opportunities to vulnerable women.  10 vulnerable women will initially be employed to create our products. By the end of the first year, these women will begin training 10 new women. In the next five years, we target to reach and train 400 women as well as give part of our company shares some of them for more economic empowerment.The word “Zayane” means “to feel at home,” and is spoken by a person who is warmly welcoming someone into their home.

We come with an abundance of experience in different areas.The Managing Director, Sam, has served for 21 years in Christian ministry; held key leadership positions; managed major local and international projects and is a board member to three reputable organizations. He holds a Bachelors degree in Biblical Studies and Mass Communication and an advanced diploma in Telecommunications Technology. He and his wife, Eunice, also managed a successful pre-school for 6 years. Currently, he is an adjunct lecturer in Christian Ministry at African Bible University in Uganda and at Bible College Berea in Blantyre, Malawi.Eunice, the Operations and Human Resources Director is multi-skilled in jewelry making and other products. She has served disadvantaged women for the past 17 years and seen positive transformation in their lives. She has also worked in various local and international jobs for 22 years such as project and human resource management, administration, lecturing and managing street children. She hosts a number of radio and TV programs that focus on women and youth. She has also won various awards related to her skills. She is inspired by her own abuse story to make a difference in the lives of other women. Eunice holds a Bachelor’s degree in Social Science. Currently, she is working at African Business Institute (ABI) in Uganda as Administration Manager.The Finance and Marketing Director, Evelyn Kachule comes to the team with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications and three years job experience as Finance and Administration Manager. She is also experienced in jewelry and bag making. Currently, she is working as an Online and Marketing Manager at ABI in Uganda.We are currently pursuing a Post-graduate course in Business Administration at ABI in Uganda. Our combined skills and experiences will be particularly relevant to Zayane Creations. These will be fully utilized to relate with and equip vulnerable women to lead better lives and the company succeed to the glory of God and to the good of the communities.The Zayane Creation team includes the following advisors and consultants:
Deus Byebiroha, Consultant
Wilson Okot, Consultant.
Marcelo Vieira, (African Business Institute Director), Advisor.
Jun Shiomitsu, (African Business Institute President), Advisor.
Within our limited time as students at ABI, we have tested our business model and skills through production and selling of products; to customers from Uganda, Malawi and 3 other countries.  During this testing phase Zayane Creations achieved tangible results from micro scales.  A shop at a nearby upmarket shopping mall has purchased and is selling Zayane Creations' products. The company has 17 pending orders from customers from USA, Brazil, Japan, Netherlands, Uganda and Malawi.Risks & ChallengesWe are aware that in life unexpected things; risks and challenges are inevitable. Zayane Creations will do everything in our power to ensure that we execute our business plan without being sidetracked by risks or challenges that may arise. As a team we are determined to face challenges head on and with the greatest transparency. We anticipate risks and challenges such as:

New entrants - Zayane Creations will develop customer royalty and retention through maintenance of production of high quality, custom made products and appropriate customer care. The company will engage in continual research to maintain product innovation and relevance. 

Training of vulnerable women taking longer than planned. - Professional trainers will be engaged to have minimal training period and start production with the women by February 2018.

Market penetration taking longer. - Zayane will market its products aggressively on line through our website; by word of mouth; partnering with relevant stakeholders; fliers’ distribution; selling at tourist destinations and exporting to foreign markets.
Zayane Creations have already been successfully producing and selling products at a micro scale and competing favorably in the saturated Ugandan market. There is scarcity, therefore high demand of the company's products in Malawi because it is an un-penetrated market. The forecast for Zayane Creations product demand is favorable.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you cannot contribute financially, but want to support this campaign, here are a couple of ways to do so:·         Use the ""share"" option here on this page to spread word of our campaign.·         You can pray for the campaign and for the successful implementation of Zayane   Creations.Thank you for believing in Zayane Creations; supporting this work transforms lives of women one product at a time.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who and Why?</h3>
<p>The soil-slinging crew from Compostwheels and frozen treat-making team from King of Pops have joined forces to fight the food waste revolution with an epic community composting effort called King of Compost. Together we aim to turn thousands of tons of landfill-destined food waste into finished compost every year - an amendment our local farms and gardens need to grow the best food possible.</p>
<p>It may seem small, but we're confident this change will not only improve the vitality of our soil and strengthen our local food system but build healthier, stronger communities as well - in an impactful and measurable way.</p>
<p>85% of food waste occurs downstream at consumer-facing homes and businesses. Atlanta alone wastes thousands of tons of food each year and lacks the composting infrastructure that many other cities have put into place to reclaim these valuable nutrients we need to strengthen our soil and grow good food.  </p>
<p>Together we're going to build it from the ground up - literally. And help increase the production of real, good food and healthy communities. Let’s grow better compost together!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What the heck is a ""windrow turner""?</h3>
<p>Now that you are inspired, you must be wondering where exactly your money is going. The windrow turner is front and center. This piece of equipment will help us compost more efficiently and produce a better product for local farms and gardens. It essentially turns the big compost piles and is propelled by the tractor. In order to leverage this awesome machine, we need to prep our site at King of Crops, get a tractor, and also make sure the finished compost is well sifted.</p>
<p>Here’s the break out:</p>
<p>Windrow turner (you’re going to want to see this transformer-esque machine in action): $50,000</p>
<p>Site prep: $10,000</p>
<p>Tractor (can’t do a proper hay ride without it): $30,000</p>
<p>Sifter (wait until you hold a handful of sifted finished compost): $30,000</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe with this equipment we can turn 2,400 tons of food waste into beautiful, nutrient rich compost annually. That's enough compost to supply many of the Atlanta area farms, community and neighborhood gardens, education gardens, and home gardens in Atlanta. Just picture all of the happy plants and people. To see the impact up close and personal, join us in celebrating the soil at the 2018 Soil Festival hosted by our incredible partners at Food Well Alliance. Don’t worry, we will send a reminder, as the event gets closer. Probably the coolest way to see the impact is to pick up one of the bags of compost at the Soil Festival and plant a thing or two in it. You will then experience the pure magic of growing your plants in compost.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>A big risk and challenge is if we don’t raise enough money. Without the funding to purchase this essential equipment to scale our operation, we won't be able to handle the overwhelming volume of food waste our city throws out each year. So……help us knock this out of the park so we can get turning.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share this with your friends on social media. Go to your local farmers market. Or eat at a local restaurant. There you will see what is possible with healthy soil. Together we can grow better compost.</p>

<h3>Short Summary..</h3>
<p>In 2016, GalleryRetail, a prosocial creative service agency, created the Newark First Fridays concept and engaged Newark Arts for promotional assistance, the host of Newark’s longest running arts festival, Open Doors, to bring to fruition a regular renowned art, music, food and cultural community event in the Newark area. (GalleryRetail aims to become a bcorp this year.)</p>
<p>Newark First Fridays is an all inclusive, safe and vital community-driven platform to showcase emerging artists, makers, artisan food vendors, musicians, and many uniquely talented street performers and vendors. There are no regular flea markets like Brooklyn, nor festivals throughout the year like New Orleans; Newark needs to both activate the streets and properly present all its talents and offerings, regularly.</p>
<p>On the first Friday of each month a downtown artwalk will host dozens of artisan food and art &amp; crafts vendors, street performances (amplified and non), and workshops, while highlighting the local businesses, galleries, and creative spaces that will open their doors during these evenings.</p>
<p>We strive to be a premier arts experience as the epicenter for the community and guests to come together to celebrate, sustain &amp; support the arts. Each month we aim to attract thousands to Newark to see and explore the city while seeking to incubate and support hundreds of artists and small businesses each year.</p>

Until then check out Oakland or Philly’s renditions, even Raleigh has first Fridays.

Risks & Challenges
RISKS
The key risks are: 

not reaching our financial goal
attracting and coordinating a large number of artists/creative spaces and small businesses to sustain the experience
need for public-private partnerships

How we'll overcome this: As a native Newarker, former public servant with the City of Newark, experience with Newark Celebration 350, and artist-entrepreneur, I understand the city's ecosystem and how best to leverage resources to deliver effective programming. Newark Arts has a long track record in engaging government and foundation partnerships to provide an array of programs and engage artists across many media. 
Most importantly, with the inclusion of the community we will have your support to adjust the Newark First Fridays experience to our need and grow it to collaboratively. Via regular surveys and community feedback sessions we will heed comments of all stakeholders and have methods to express areas of need to stakeholders.

<h3><u>Let us tell you about the product </u></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why vulva?</h3>
<p>Our brand is the result of a introspective look into what does it mean to be feminine in a traditional setting as Peru. Here, underwear brands for women that are available have a very strong personality, classifying women into two categories: the sexy one, who loves lace on everything, or the boring one, who wears granny panties. And as we know, there are so many more types of women; like you, like me or your girlfriends.</p>

<h3>
<br/>So where does that leave us?</h3>
<p>The ones that don’t want to wear push-ups or the ones that don’t want to adapt our bodies into molds that clearly haven’t thought about our real bodies. Well, we’re the ones looking for a new proposal that will makes us feel comfortable in our own skin.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What do we mean by comfortable?</h3>
<p>Underwear that will fit in just right in every size and body;  no matter how curvy or thin you are, Vulva will make you fall in love with you again on a daily basis.<br/><br/>And how? With <strong>cotton underwear</strong>, that will makes us feel much freer than ever!</p>

<h3><u>And now about the girls who will turn their lifes around</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why women from prison?</h3>
<p>Because we believe growing up and learning from our mistakes (and because believing in second chances it’s so cliché). The Virgin of Fatima prison is not like a regular penitentiary facility. It’s actually a place for women who have committed minor crimes, with short sentences and, that above all, want to learn and overcome their current situation.</p> <p>These women, despite being held in Virgen de Fátima penitentiary; are <strong>not deprived of learning new things</strong>.

<h3><u>Your impact</u></h3>
<p>By contributing to Vulva Underwear you’ll change the lives of these women and ours. A day of work with Vulva for them will mean: an opportunity to learn and grow and continuous income to help themselves, their families and to save up for the future.</p>
<p>Your contribution will allow us to set up our workshop in Virgen de Fátima and also  carry out other workshops that will help the women improve their social and artistic skills such as  painting, music, reading and management that will be helpful in their reinsertion process and to prevent them from making the same mistakes from before.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>43.4% of the total land area of Liberia is covered with rainforest from which about 30 million dollars worth of timber is exported annually to Europe and China. Yet, more than 60% of wooden furniture used by the working class citizens, business owners, hospitals, NGOs, and the government in Liberia are imported at high cost. This creates a huge gap in the furniture industry in Liberia.</p>
<p>The LACK OF EQUIPMENT (especially kilns) to efficiently produce kiln-dried, quality, standardized and customized furniture is the cause of this lopsided import/export gap. The need to remove this obstacle is our greatest goal as we run this campaign.  </p>
<p>We are citizens of Liberia who grew up in our country going through the 14 years of civil crisis. Now we are on the stage to improve the lifestyle of our citizens and grow our economy. Mr. Chris Mendin (CEO) was raised by an unemployed single mother which delayed his education. At 14 years of age, he was taken to a woodwork shop to acquire carpentry skills and later enrolled at a vocational school where he studied General Construction with an emphasis in woodwork. This knowledge supported Mr. Mendin to complete secondary education and get a college degree. Chris has worked on various projects with national and international organizations such as Serving in Mission (SIM), Samaritan's Purse, and the African Bible College University in Liberia. Chris is working with six additional team members. Five of whom  are well skilled carpenters while one is skilled in computer knowledge such as designing, building database, and online services. Chris has decided to use his skills and the rest of the team to build this company and train youth in Liberia for self-sustainability.  </p>
<p>Your support to this campaign coupled with our skills, we all transform the furniture industry and train youth for self-sustainability in Liberia. Join us to bring great transformation in Liberia and be a part of training youth for self-sustainability.   </p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need $40,000 USD to start Diligent Hands Furniture. About 83.6% of this amount is to be used for purchasing equipment; and the balance 16.4% will be used to cover insurance, construction of production site, and begin our operation. However, we seek to raise $25,000 USD through this campaign and the rest ($10,000 USD) will be raised from external investor.  </p>

<p><strong>Where the funds go if we don't reach our entire goal.</strong></p>
<p>Focusing on our primary target, we will use the funds for purchasing some of our most important machineries such as a kiln, table saw, power planer, and wood jointer. Indeed, it be will be challenging, but we will surely begin with what we can raise and with the equipment we can purchase.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The success of our campaign will impact citizens of Liberia in the following  areas.</p>
<p>We are seeking to solve the long standing problem of Liberians struggling to purchase imported furniture with high cost regardless of  the available resource in our country.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we are on the way to facilitating skill training for at-risk youth to promote self-sustainability. Your support to this campaign copule with our skills, we build Liberia together and train youth for self-sustainability. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> With our skills  and knowledge, we still anticipate challenges with legal process, setting up equipment, and capturing the minds of our customers. However, Diligent Hands was registered and has been operated as contracting company for the past three years. Moreover, we are presently negotiating for production as we relocate our company to the capital. Regarding our target market, we have worked in the past three years for residential owners, profitable and non-profitable organizations as mentioned in our personal story. With such record, we presently have pending contract. Therefore, we anticipate these challenges, but we are prepared and working to overcome them. Please let us know of concerns you might have because they will be useful to us in our preparation. Thank you for your support.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We highly appreciate your time and interest in reading our story. If you are unable to contribute financially for any reason, donate any equipment on our list. Please also share our story with friends, family, workmates who can help, or share on social media. If not, pray with us and make comments.</p>

Where the funds go if we don't reach our entire goal.
Focusing on our primary target, we will use the funds for purchasing some of our most important machineries such as a kiln, table saw, power planer, and wood jointer. Indeed, it be will be challenging, but we will surely begin with what we can raise and with the equipment we can purchase.

The Impact
The success of our campaign will impact citizens of Liberia in the following  areas.
We are seeking to solve the long standing problem of Liberians struggling to purchase imported furniture with high cost regardless of  the available resource in our country.
Most importantly, we are on the way to facilitating skill training for at-risk youth to promote self-sustainability. Your support to this campaign copule with our skills, we build Liberia together and train youth for self-sustainability. 

Risks & Challenges
 With our skills  and knowledge, we still anticipate challenges with legal process, setting up equipment, and capturing the minds of our customers. However, Diligent Hands was registered and has been operated as contracting company for the past three years. Moreover, we are presently negotiating for production as we relocate our company to the capital. Regarding our target market, we have worked in the past three years for residential owners, profitable and non-profitable organizations as mentioned in our personal story. With such record, we presently have pending contract. Therefore, we anticipate these challenges, but we are prepared and working to overcome them. Please let us know of concerns you might have because they will be useful to us in our preparation. Thank you for your support.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’m Jane Yuen-Lin Mahowald, owner of Assure Quality Painting, the only minority-, woman-owned paint contracting company serving industrial and commercial markets in Minnesota and much of the upper Midwest.  I've spent almost 20 years in the paint industry as well as 8 years as Office Manager/Regional Trainer for a business serving 12 states, managing a staff of 75.</p>
<p>AQP is a young business created to help lift minorities and women out of the cycle of poverty.  Our business is a means of achieving that end.  We have 15 highly skilled employees, 13 of whom are minority and/or women.  We have been very successful thus far by working on important, highly visible projects, ranging from the US Bank Stadium housing the Minnesota Vikings football team to a new city water treatment plant and much more.   You can see many of the projects on our web site:   <a href=""http://www.aqpainting.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.aqpainting.com</a>   Initially we did not make much money because we were learning how to estimate large projects.  We also invested in obtaining every certification required to work on government projects from federal to local projects and employee training.  Now we have experience and are in a mentoring program to make sure our estimates include reasonable profit, we have skilled, professional employees, exceptional project management and all certifications.  We receive requests to bid on every government funded project and major private construction projects in Minnesota with several million dollars-worth in hand.</p>
<p>But we have a serious barrier to overcome.</p>
<p>We must fund equipment, materials and salaries for a minimum of 90 days - - for every job - - before we can submit any invoice for work done.  That continues throughout the course of the contract.  It means having lots of money up front before we can submit a bid.  Being a minority and women-owned company, we do not have access to funds from banks and other traditional resources like other businesses (a nationwide problem).  Funds have been exhausted getting the company running and training people to become skilled professionals.  So, we are trying something different: crowdfunding.</p>
<p>Your contributions will enable us to bid on some of these requests, demonstrate the capabilities  of our employees, perform high quality work and create sustainable cash flow. We also will expand our efforts beyond Minnesota.  Our goal is to train and hire 100 minorities/women within two years.  Every penny contributed to our Indiegogo campaign will go toward that effort.</p>
<p>Of course we appreciate and want to recognize everyone who helps us achieve this goal.  Here is how we will do it.</p>
<p>We will donate $1 to 1 of 3 women's empowerment causes for every contribution made, no matter how small.  You will also be recognized on our website.  Contributors of $30 or more will also receive a T shirt with an empowerment theme.  For $150 we'll add an insulated steel travel mug, and for $300, a Bluetooth selfie stick.  Everyone gets our undying gratitude.</p>
<p>Whether you can contribute to our success or not, please, please tell everyone you know about our campaign who believes in helping minorities and women rise from the cycle of impoverishment and attitudes of worthlessness. </p>
<p>Together we can take a small step forward by building confidence, creating skills, offering equitable jobs, reducing unemployment, shrinking the skills gap, helping rebuild and improve our infrastructure, empowering women and minorities, and most important, creating hope.</p>
<p>With determination and hope anything can be accomplished.  It will be a brighter future.</p>

<p><b><i><u>WHY A MUSIC VENUE?</u></i></b></p>
<p>Hello fellow music lovers! My name is Brittany Crooms, Owner and Managing Director of Gypsy Rose Music. First, a little bit about myself. Sweet and simple, my happy place is dancing at a show. The outside world just fades away and I become fully and joyfully enmeshed in the present moment. It is truly my soul food, and I love to ride that beautiful post-show high for days! Music has the unique ability to transcend language, bridge multiple generations, cross boundaries &amp; bring people together like nothing else. I wanted to create community where the music lovers and musical magicians UNITE, immerse themselves in the music and forget about the rest of the world for a while. I fully support the dreams and growth of musicians who are dedicated to crossing these boundaries, thereby enriching the community and culture in the city that I love; the community that has become family to me.</p>
<p>I have often craved somewhere in this wonderful community where my love of music can come to life. Roswell does not currently have a venue devoted specifically to original, live music… so the seed was planted. The more this plan grew, the more the community came together to support the idea, demonstrating a high demand for this type of establishment in our community. The support and positive feedback from roswell citizens and business owners has been overwhelming, not only on social media, but in person as well. The general consensus is that we can't open fast enough! </p>
<p>It is also important to me that the team working together at GR feels like a family… all working toward a common goal, each passionate about music, musicians, our community unification and positive vibes!</p>
<p><u><i><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</strong></i></u></p>
<p>Here's where we need your support! In order to enrich and unite our community through the art of music, we need to raise funds which will go directly towards necessary building renovations costing upwards of $150,000. The interior requires full renovation to optimise the music experience for both our patrons as well as our musicians. This includes custom stage and lighting, state of the art sound system, 24ft custom bar, new flooring, electrical, HVAC, sprinkler system, and additional insulation for optimal sound. On the exterior, we will build a new deck and landscaping for enjoying food, beverage and music outside. </p>
<p>We are passionately committed to making this dream a reality for our incredible city. Our goal is to raise $100,000 from generous members like you, who share in our vision of bringing live music and amazing energy to this community. Your contributions are what will ultimately bring this vision to life!</p>
<p>When you contribute to Gypsy Rose Music, you will receive a variety of high value perks including but not limited to VIP access, FREE admission, HUGE discounts on venue rental for private events, Gypsy Rose gift cards, and of course, all kinds of fun swag! </p>
<p>We, here at Gypsy Rose, embody the community spirit by serving local, craft beers, cross promoting and supporting businesses around us, hosting community events, workshops and being a place for musicians to come and practice on our off hours, all while operating in a way that has the least impact possible on the natural environment.</p>
<p>We are incredibly grateful for whatever amount you are able to contribute to making this dream a reality. If you are unable to support financially, please pass this along and help us spread the word. Thank you, your support so so greatly appreciated! The value this venue will bring to Roswell will be immeasurable.</p>

<h3>The Museum of Beer San Diego</h3>
<p><strong>Community. Pride. Passion. Collaboration</strong>. These are the elements we love most about San Diego brewing (other than the beer, of course!). And we want to celebrate and share San Diego's story with you and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Museum of Beer will be downtown San Diego’s “Beer Welcome Center,” the central hub and first stop that everyone comes to when they want to begin the ultimate hands-on San Diego beer journey.</p>
<p>Museum of Beer will provide an inspiring and exciting experience for every kind of guest—from the longtime craft expert to the novice who’s never tasted a craft beer. </p>
<p>Museum of Beer will support San Diego’s vibrant beer community. We will feature exhibits and technology that promote the San Diego Brewers Guild and will drive business to all of our local independent breweries. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553704375/cbp7ixmsef8hrnd2oz0v.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Museum of Beer San Diego will be made up of eight core exhibits that represent the most important and engaging topics related to beer and San Diego craft beer. Each major exhibit will be supplemented by a variety of supporting exhibits and experiences, all designed to maximize guest interaction, immersion, and enjoyment.</p>
<p><strong>Exhibits will include</strong>: The Science of Beer • The Beer Universe • America’s Hoppiest City: The Story of San Diego’s Craft Beer History • Be the Brewer Experience • Getting Beer to You • The Art of Craft: From Can to Canvas • The Sun, Surf, and Beer! San Diego Experience • Beer for Breakfast with 91X Media Center</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Goal </span></h3>
<p>We’re asking for your support to build a 10,000+-square-foot venue that will be the downtown jewel of San Diego’s craft beer scene. The crowd-sourcing goal of $150,000 is only a small portion of the overall budget, but it's one of the most important components of our project. From the beginning, our mantra has been that the museum is going to be ""Built <i>by</i> Craft Beer Lovers <i>for</i> Craft Beer Lovers,"" and we need your help to fulfill that mission!</p>
<p>Your contribution will go to physical construction of the venue and exhibits, educational operations, bar/restaurant infrastructure, stage/sound and lights, a VW Bus promotional vehicle, graphic artwork, marketing, and—most importantly—the small 3-barrel brew system we will use for collaborations and demonstrations on how to brew beer like a pro.  </p>
<p>Help us build a place that celebrates the craft!  Let's build the Museum of Beer!</p>

</div></div>","The Museum of Beer San Diego
Community. Pride. Passion. Collaboration. These are the elements we love most about San Diego brewing (other than the beer, of course!). And we want to celebrate and share San Diego's story with you and the rest of the world.
Museum of Beer will be downtown San Diego’s “Beer Welcome Center,” the central hub and first stop that everyone comes to when they want to begin the ultimate hands-on San Diego beer journey.
Museum of Beer will provide an inspiring and exciting experience for every kind of guest—from the longtime craft expert to the novice who’s never tasted a craft beer. 
Museum of Beer will support San Diego’s vibrant beer community. We will feature exhibits and technology that promote the San Diego Brewers Guild and will drive business to all of our local independent breweries. 
Museum of Beer San Diego will be made up of eight core exhibits that represent the most important and engaging topics related to beer and San Diego craft beer. Each major exhibit will be supplemented by a variety of supporting exhibits and experiences, all designed to maximize guest interaction, immersion, and enjoyment.
Exhibits will include: The Science of Beer • The Beer Universe • America’s Hoppiest City: The Story of San Diego’s Craft Beer History • Be the Brewer Experience • Getting Beer to You • The Art of Craft: From Can to Canvas • The Sun, Surf, and Beer! San Diego Experience • Beer for Breakfast with 91X Media Center
The Museum of Beer will also include: A full Tasting Room with 65 exclusively San Diego taps; an artisanal pizza kitchen; an unparalleled bottle list featuring rare and limited release bottles; a barrel-aged experience; a killer Merch Tank;  a private event space; and an outdoor Beer Garden with a stage and live music.


The Goal 
We’re asking for your support to build a 10,000+-square-foot venue that will be the downtown jewel of San Diego’s craft beer scene. The crowd-sourcing goal of $150,000 is only a small portion of the overall budget, but it's one of the most important components of our project. From the beginning, our mantra has been that the museum is going to be ""Built by Craft Beer Lovers for Craft Beer Lovers,"" and we need your help to fulfill that mission!
Your contribution will go to physical construction of the venue and exhibits, educational operations, bar/restaurant infrastructure, stage/sound and lights, a VW Bus promotional vehicle, graphic artwork, marketing, and—most importantly—the small 3-barrel brew system we will use for collaborations and demonstrations on how to brew beer like a pro.  
Help us build a place that celebrates the craft!  Let's build the Museum of Beer!

<p>We are transforming the 4000 sq. ft. space in downtown Fairfax (formerly Fairfax Cyclery) into Splitrock Tap &amp; Wheel! The SF Bay Areas newest destination bike shop.The new store will comprise of 3 main operations:</p>
<p>Showroom and demo center for Whyte Bikes, our exclusive brand from the UK, as well as a carefully selected assortment of parts and accessories from brands we know and trust.</p>
<p>Best in class service and repairs for all bikes</p>
<p>Cafe featuring pizzas, sandwiches, Beer, Wine and Coffee drinks.</p>
<p>We need your help to finish the kitchen so we can start the taps flowing!</p>

<p>Our building is solid, and reasonably modern, but adding the cafe to the space triggered a list of required upgrades, including upgrades to the sewer system, fire sprinkler system, and HVAC system</p>
<p>These additional requirements have delayed our opening by several months</p>
<p>All funds raised through this campaign will go directly into finishing the kitchen and the dining space, assuring we get open and serving you ASAP.</p>
<p>Your contribution is worth every penny, and more.</p>
<p>If you look at all of the tiers available in our fundraising campaign, you will see that in each case you will get perks in return that are at least as valuable as your investment, and in many cases much more than your contribution.  Basically our intent is to pre-sell food, drinks, service and store items so we can get across the line, and get the store open.</p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I'm Boris from Mauritius Island and after a brief trial in the “modern working world” I realise that it's not my cup of tea and I started to work for myself and I would describe me as an ""artisanal entrepreneur"". I'm part of a team working on the reborn of a bookshop in the center of the island. I have a small bistro just in front of the bookshop and now I'm half way on the project to open the natural ingredient grocery, bakery and pizzeria I ask you to contribute for.</p>
<p>Amandine, my wife is together with me in this project and also supports the rebuilt of the bookshop. </p>
<p>In this place, people will be able to buy all the natural ingredients they need, pay for the ingredients and no more for the ""packaging nor the branding"" and only the amount they need.</p>
<p>We want also support local farmers which start organic permaculture bringing their products to customers and use it in the bakery and pizzeria. The aim is to propose good quality products at lower price and contribute to a greener planet. </p>
<p>Imagine a place attracting you with the warmth of the atmosphere combining elegant rustic wooden furniture, green plants, the smell of the bread just baked and the fresh brewed coffee. Inside you discover a variety of bags and jars full of 100% natural products such as : rices, grains and nuts, spices, coffee beans, teas, herbs to infuse, olive oils, vinegars, natural shampoo and body wash, cleaners for the house, and lot of more products. A one stop shop offering a bakery corner with artisan breads, varieties of pastries, tarts, pies and Italian pizzas (with gluten free, paleo, dairy-free options) made with good quality ingredients directly taken from the bulk grocery.</p>
<p>We are half way from our objective and we need your contribution to achieve this project. Crowdfunding is unknown by the majority of people living in Mauritius and we think that it's a really nice concept to help to start small business or social campaign. We need you!!  ;-)  </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are half way to the opening, we already finance $ 25 000 with all our economy, and contribution of our family.</p>
<p>We have the location and we started to pay a rent since September 2017, we did all the work (renovation of the premise, plumbing, electricity, lighting system, wood recycling furniture, bought some jars and accessories) and it took a very long time as we were supposed to open in November 2017, we target with your help February 2018! </p>
<p>We already bought some kitchen and bakery equipment (second hand small electric pizza oven, planetary mixer, fridge, freezer, built in gas stove and oven, some inox table, sink and a refrigerate show case).</p>
<p>We need help to buy:</p>
<ol>
<li>a small gas bread &amp; pizza oven</li>
<li>a second hand commercial convection oven </li>
<li>an extractor system</li>
<li>a inox table top fridge</li>
<li>a Spiral mixer</li>
<li>a rolling mill machine </li>
<li>all small furniture : saucepan, etc.</li>
<li>a warm showcase</li>
<li>air conditioner for cold pastry kitchen</li>
<li>awnings for shop front &amp; logo signage</li>
<li>racks and shelfs for storage and kitchen</li>
<li>roller shutter for the windows security</li>
<li>some chairs for sitting customers</li>
<li>POS system</li>
<li>Scale for weighting products</li>
<li>water tank 5000L and filter for rain harvest system</li>
<li>Jars and recipient for food display and storage</li>
<li>The inital stock to start !</li>
</ol>
<p>This list isn't exhaustive, there's so much hidden little things that we didn't consider. But we are motivated by our dream and each dollar will serve to bring this project alive. Small steps count! </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We want to give to this place an heart and make people confortable to come and see that buying the essential could be an enjoyable thing at a right price. It's time to stop feeding the big industries, the big commercial center and we need to go back “earth to earth” and start participate with small steps to save our planet and our soul.</p>
<p>We think that being the first to do this in Mauritius will give other people the kick to do the same and make more people concern about this way of living, it’s also an opportunity to offer the already concern people an easier way make this change…</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The risk is that people are perhaps not ready to make this move, it will be easier for them to keep their habits and buy prepacked foods (or foods with lot of artificials as they don't really read or understand the ingredients on the package). </p>
<p>To overcome this, we think that the best way is to communicate, using Facebook, our Web site, e-mailing, writing article in local newspapers, organise in this place around our big central table some workshop and projection on recycling, environment, permaculture and how to go green.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>You can help us making some noise about our campaign, sharing our Facebook page, using the indiegogo share tools &amp; sending us good vibrations by air ;-)</p>

<h3>Roam Playspace </h3>
<p>Roam Playspace is  an intentional indoor play space created for kids AND parents to have fun and to grow increasingly grounded, empowered, and free. While children play,  parents step into relaxation, community, and can choose to explore and grow their vision for parenthood and life— all in one space. Offerings include top notch toys,  a beautiful space, community tables for a picnic, and an innovative style of interactive opt-in workshop learning for parents. Roam Playspace is a space designed by a team of experts in discovery-based, child directed free play. It is also a place to find community and  be cheered on as a parent!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>By supporting Roam Playspace you are investing in:</p>
<ul>
<li>an indoor play structure </li>
<li>stations designed for open-ended play</li>
<li>innovative and developmental toys</li>
<li>unique, discovery based workshop series for parents and families</li>
<li>a space that addreses the needs of both children and parents in Shasta Co</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact: Addressing ACEs</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, the concept of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) has been a hot topic when it comes to child development and the well-being of a community. Experiences like incarceration of a family member, mental illness or substance abuse in the home, and abuse of any kind have a direct impact on the life outcomes of the children who experience them.</p>
<p>The number of ACEs a child endures correlates directly to an increased risk of many diseases and causes of early death. Children in Shasta County experience more ACEs than most children in the state.</p>
<p>Shasta county has some of the highest ACE statistics in the state. Here are a few of the statistics</p>
<ul>
<li>17.1 % Have an incarcerated family member </li>
<li>29.7% Have witnessed domestic violence</li>
<li>54.5 % Have experienced verbal abuse</li>
<li>57.7 % Have experienced family substance abuse</li>
</ul>
<p>The good news is that kids who experience these things CAN heal and have a bright future.  In addition to healing, studies have shown that there are some specific protective factors against the impact of ACEs in a community. </p>
<p>Roam Playspace will directly address ACEs through the protective factors of: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Social Connections</i>: Roam will be a place where families can connect, create, and strengthen the social connections that are integral for strong families and communities </li>
<li>
<i>Knowledge of parenting practices and childhood development</i>: Opt- in workshops at Roam Playspace will come from a variety of community voices and focus on many aspects of parenting and development </li>
<li>
<i>Social and emotional competence in children</i>: Learning to interact with and navigate relationships to other children and adults is key to a child's development, and this happens naturally through open-ended play. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>About the Founders</h3>
<p>Alan and Anna have been on the parenting journey for 5 years and on a personal level have seen the force of a parenting community,  the lifeline of experts to support during challenges, and the power of intentional play. </p>
<p>Alan studied medicine with an emphasis on the low-income families of Appalachia. He has been a physician assistant for 8 years, and he especially enjoys connecting with kids in the ER. He has worked mostly in emergency medicine, with some of that time in the ER of a children's hospital.  He feels honored to be connected to a community of people addressing child development and ACEs in Redding.</p>
<p>Anna was trained as a life coach in 2007 and has been a practicing doula since 2013. She has developed materials that guide women in utilizing the experiences of pregnancy, birthing, postpartum, and early motherhood as a catalyst for their own personal and parenting growth.  Anna saw the power of play and movement in trauma recovery  using swim and art therapy with children who lost their parents in the 2004 tsunami. She leads an international team that resources people in emotional and physical wholeness.</p>
<p>Alan and Anna are consulting with a team of individuals who are incredible thinkers and practioners in the areas of play, the use of space, child development, parent resourcing, healing, and community needs.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We love consulting with experts in the fields of childhood development, fun, parenting, and child-directed play. We are also creating a line up of workshops with a variety of voices. Be in touch if you would like to be involved! </p>

54.5 % Have experienced verbal abuse
57.7 % Have experienced family substance abuse

The good news is that kids who experience these things CAN heal and have a bright future.  In addition to healing, studies have shown that there are some specific protective factors against the impact of ACEs in a community. 
Roam Playspace will directly address ACEs through the protective factors of: 


Social Connections: Roam will be a place where families can connect, create, and strengthen the social connections that are integral for strong families and communities 

Knowledge of parenting practices and childhood development: Opt- in workshops at Roam Playspace will come from a variety of community voices and focus on many aspects of parenting and development 

Social and emotional competence in children: Learning to interact with and navigate relationships to other children and adults is key to a child's development, and this happens naturally through open-ended play. 


About the Founders
Alan and Anna have been on the parenting journey for 5 years and on a personal level have seen the force of a parenting community,  the lifeline of experts to support during challenges, and the power of intentional play. 
Alan studied medicine with an emphasis on the low-income families of Appalachia. He has been a physician assistant for 8 years, and he especially enjoys connecting with kids in the ER. He has worked mostly in emergency medicine, with some of that time in the ER of a children's hospital.  He feels honored to be connected to a community of people addressing child development and ACEs in Redding.
Anna was trained as a life coach in 2007 and has been a practicing doula since 2013. She has developed materials that guide women in utilizing the experiences of pregnancy, birthing, postpartum, and early motherhood as a catalyst for their own personal and parenting growth.  Anna saw the power of play and movement in trauma recovery  using swim and art therapy with children who lost their parents in the 2004 tsunami. She leads an international team that resources people in emotional and physical wholeness.
Alan and Anna are consulting with a team of individuals who are incredible thinkers and practioners in the areas of play, the use of space, child development, parent resourcing, healing, and community needs.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
We love consulting with experts in the fields of childhood development, fun, parenting, and child-directed play. We are also creating a line up of workshops with a variety of voices. Be in touch if you would like to be involved!

<h3>The Cup of Hope Project</h3>
<p>We will make a coffee bar that is a safe place for those suffering from mental health challenges and 100% of the proceeds will benefit mental health education and suicide prevention.</p>
<h3>We are working to bring the Cup of Hope to Tampa / Wesley Chapel, FL area!</h3>
<p>Brought to you by the Defeat Suicide Foundation, a 501(c)3 registered non-profit, the Cup of Hope will be a coffee bar where 100% of the proceeds support mental health education and suicide prevention.</p>
<p>This will be the perfect space where mental health counselors will be available, volunteers can hang out and enjoy meeting new people, those in need of finding someone to talk to can find people ready to talk, and an overall safe place for everyone to enjoy some great coffee.</p>
<p>ALL Cup of Hope baristas will be trained in recognizing and assisting those with signs and symptoms of mental health challenges as part of the hiring process!</p>
<p>We will continue to share the message that it's OK to not be OK while breaking the silence around suicide and mental health challenges.</p>
<p>We get it! Life can throw us curve balls and some days we need a cup of coffee, somedays we need a bagel with our coffee, and somedays we need someone who cares to speak into our lives so we can get through the day.</p>

But we still have so much work to do. While we continue to <b>improve infrastructure</b>, we'll be preparing hundreds more plants and seeds to start in our nursery and plant in our fields.

—Jani Benjamins and Kipp Koren, co-founders, Leaping Bridge Farms

We're an integrated polyculture farm located in Paonia, Colorado, using sustainable techniques and innovative green technology to raise organic crops, perennial plants, and herbs. Our mission is to grow highly nutritious, organic food by utilizing no-till methods pioneered by Masanobu Fukuoka, along with passive solar geothermal greenhouses and the heat from compost piles, which will allow us to grow specialty crops year-round. Along the way, we intend to work with nature, restoring wildlife habitat.

We plan to produce and offer fermented foods, skin products, gourmet and medicinal mushrooms, perennial trees and shrubs, organic fruits and vegetables, along with bees for honey production.


What We Need 


To bring our farm to fruition, we're raising funding for:











solar panels: $2,000
basic tools like broadfork/chainsaw/harvesting clippers : $500
soil amendments and compost: $1,500
potting soil, plants, shelves, and seeds: $2,000
labor: $4,000
bee hives: $350
additional irrigation infrastructure: $200
composting toilet materials: $1,500
biogas generator: $1,500
building materials/plumbing work/electrical work: $2,500



    The Impact We're trying to have a positive influence on the land, and to help people access healthier foods and safer products by focusing on soil health and a diversity of plants. Having a great diversity of plants helps pollinators like bees acquire more beneficial pollen which they turn into a healthier, more nutrient-dense honey. In addition, we're creating our own microclimate by incorporating beneficial soil amendments and plants in the fields, in order to increase the overall biodiversity on the property.

Slowly, we've pieced this property together and remodeled a derelict cabin into something habitable, and planted 50 different types of annuals and perennials in an attempt to transform Jack's land into a diverse and thriving farm. But we still have so much work to do. While we continue to improve infrastructure, we'll be preparing hundreds more plants and seeds to start in our nursery and plant in our fields. By ensuring we have the resources needed to cultivate this first year's round of crops, we'll establish a working foundation for a sustainable livelihood now, and for years to come.Community Starts with YouWe are striving to strengthen community by giving people an opportunity to work on something they are passionate about. From our local community in Paonia to our global network, we have many collaborators, partners, and specialists who'd love to work with us on these projects—yet we're short on the capital needed to lift these projects off the ground. We're putting every dollar toward our dream and are grateful for any help you may be able to offer: please consider making a small donation, and please help us spread the word by encouraging others to learn about our farm and this campaign. Through word of mouth and your support, we can create a model for small businesses to revitalize local economies and strengthen communities.

Thank you,

<h3>The Savannah Mini Golf Rental Story </h3>
<p>   My name is Joshua Holz and I am the founder of Savannah Mini Golf Rental. You could say the company has passed it's storyboard stage. We have all of our ideas on paper and we need YOU to make this dream a reality. I served in the Army National Guard for 6.5 years and have been a Police Officer for the last 2.5 years. During these years, I have developed a real connection with the people of the community. One of my goals for Savannah Mini Golf Rental is to create a fun, entertaining and philanthropic setting for people in and around the area.  I have always wanted to start my own business and Savannah Mini Golf Rental is the perfect opportunity to launch my entrepreneurial career!   </p>
<p><b>What is Savannah Mini Golf Rental?</b></p>
<p><b>   </b>Savannah Mini Golf Rental is a portable mini golf course rental company. The market is for corporate events and parties, churches, birthday parties, community events, charity events, and many more. Even if there are no reservations during a day, Savannah Mini Golf Rental will be used in local malls and establishments for year round entertainment. The course will only require a minimum of  1,500 sq. ft. with the largest space being 2,450 sq. ft. for 9 holes. </p>
<p>    Savannah Mini Golf Rental will also donate rentals to charities throughout the year to help raise money and provide entertainment for the community. Your contributions will help us with a down payment for 9 portable holes (expansion possibilities), putters, balls, an enclosed cargo trailer for transporting the course, a graphic wrap that will be placed on the trailer for advertising the company, along with the strong possibly of increasing local employment as the business continues to grow. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Why we need YOU!!!</h3> <p>   We need the help of YOU and YOUR friends to help us reach our goal of $5,500 for a down payment on the loan for Savannah Mini Golf Rental. This loan will help cover costs for the course itself, an enclosed cargo trailer with graphic wrapping advertising 'Savannah Mini Golf Rental' and, of course, the mini golf equipment. If this goal is reached, we will be able to have everything up and running by late August, along with getting our name out there for next season! </p>
<p>   If the goal is not reached we may spend $2.00 on a box of tissues to wipe our tears but we will still succeed! Whatever portion of the goal we receive from you to invest with, will still be put towards the loan. We are trying to have a cash pool for immediate expansion and purchases that will move the company forward, based on demand.  </p>
<p> We know that not everyone lives in beautiful Savannah, Georgia to enjoy the fun that Savannah Mini Golf Rental will offer. However, you will still be able to tell your friends and family that you helped fund a company that will not only entertain thousands of people in the area, it will also create an impact in the community by generating money for several known charities around! PLUS we send you the swag to remind you of that too!!!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Making a Footprint</h3>
<div>     This type of business has been proven to be a highly successful fundraising tool used for providing increasing amounts of money to major charities. Everyone enjoys mini golf and this will also be an easy way to bring mini golf to people who are less fortunate and have never had the opportunity to play. Its a great icebreaker and entertainment option for corporate events, parties, community outings, and many more. </div>
<div>       During the first months this will be a two person operation. When business increases to two or more appointments in a day, we will be able to increase the number of employees . We already have a great customer service/public relations team member and would love to have more team members with equally great skill sets. </div> </div> <div> <h3>The Not So Scary Risks</h3>
<div>     So there is good news... and good news! If Savannah Mini Golf Rental were to average 2 reservations a month, the monthly loan payment would be completely paid for in addition to making a small profit. If Savannah Mini Golf Rental does not average at that rate, the loan will still be paid for from the cash pool and/or personal savings. That will be a very, very rare situation since we have already created promising relationships with a few companies that would use Savannah Mini Golf Rental's services multiple times a year. </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>    We know that not all of you reading this can help us financially, which is OK because we still love you! But, you can still help us by telling your friends, family, and coworkers about Savannah Mini Golf Rental. Just like Mom used to say, ""Use your words and talk to your friends, or at least share it on Facebook or Twitter."" Okay, Mom never said this but, you get the hint...</p>
<p>    A very strong handshake, and a sincere THANK YOU from your friends at Savannah Mini Golf Rental!</p>

</div><h3><span>***update** This project is bigger than we thought it would be, requiring a grand amount of money, time and building, so while we search for investors/business partners we will take a few steps back and start small.  Julie will be incorporating Himalayan Salt into some of her Sound Healing events, combining the elements of Earth and Ether for a blissful experience.  She will also soon offer Himalayan Salt products such lamps and candles, and she will combine essential oils to create spa and wellness products such as bath salts and nasal inhalers.</span></h3><h3><span>My Salt Story</span></h3><p>Last year while visiting my sister in Arizona, we took a little shopping excursion to a Himalayan Salt Lamp store.  We were going to stop in, check it out and then grab some lunch.  While in the store, I stumbled upon a small, cave-like room with the floor and part of a wall laid in Himalayan Salt bricks that beckoned me in with their glow.  I wandered in, sat in one of the chairs and announced that I would be resting in there for a while.  The energy in the room drew me in and instantly relaxed me. I emerged after about 20 minutes ready to shop, and three hours later we were loading up the car with lamps, salt bars, bath salts and much more.  I already knew that Himalayan Salt Lamps created a blissful environment, but learned so much more just by experiencing the energy shift and relaxing feeling from being in that room.  The store clerk explained how the Himalayan Salt emits negative ions when lit and heated.  These negative ions are actually a good thing because they help dissipate disharmonious energy given off by wifi, computers, cell phones, etc.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438572597/ua0nbm7fghx9vjyrgron.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 573.9066666666666px; height: 429px;""/></p>(The Inspiration Salt Room)<div>
<br/><p>I truly felt a rebalancing of my my body and mind while I was in that room, and I wanted more!  I came home to San Diego and began my search for a salt cave here that I could go chill in, but to my dismay, the closest ones I could find were in Burbank and Santa Barbara.  I was bummed for a while because I would have to road trip to experience that again, but then I was inspired.  San Diego needs our own Himalayan Salt Cave and I wanted to make that a reality.  I have partnered with two incredible local business women, <b>Jennifer Opaka</b> and <b>Elaine Davis</b>, and we are bringing the bliss to San Diego!</p>
<h3>Bliss Cavern</h3>
<p><b><i>Bliss Cavern</i></b> will be a unique healing space with dedicated rooms for massage, private yoga, Roll &amp; Release therapy, and a Himalayan Salt Cave.  The heart and soul of Bliss Cavern is the Halogenerator, which grinds salt to nanometer size and pumps it into the room, emulating the conditions inside a natural salt cave, creating a calm, relaxing environment.  Dry salt therapy has been used for years to help people alleviate different types of respiratory and skin conditions.  Himalayan Salt is naturally anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, and anti-microbial and gets deep down into our lungs, so that it cleanses the entire respiratory system including mouth, sinuses, nasal cavities, throat and lungs. The tiny particles of salt will help flush impurities and are perfect for respiratory health.  Originating centuries ago in the natural salt mines of Eastern Europe, salt therapy has spread worldwide and is expanding into the United States....and now to San Diego!  Step into the <b><i>Bliss Cavern - Salt &amp; Sound Sanctuary </i></b>for salt therapy sessions, sound healing events, yoga and meditation classes, massage/energy healing and more! </p>

<p>With your support we will be able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Redesign the space and make structural changes to the existing building that will allow us to build out private therapy rooms, as well as the salt cave that will have enough space to fit up to 20 people inside at a time.</p></li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Purchase Himalayan Rock Salt to build the internal structure of the salt cave, add a special Halogenerator, and build a dedicated ventilation system that will ensure the air inside the room remains clean and pure.</span>

</div></div>","***update** This project is bigger than we thought it would be, requiring a grand amount of money, time and building, so while we search for investors/business partners we will take a few steps back and start small.  Julie will be incorporating Himalayan Salt into some of her Sound Healing events, combining the elements of Earth and Ether for a blissful experience.  She will also soon offer Himalayan Salt products such lamps and candles, and she will combine essential oils to create spa and wellness products such as bath salts and nasal inhalers.My Salt StoryLast year while visiting my sister in Arizona, we took a little shopping excursion to a Himalayan Salt Lamp store.  We were going to stop in, check it out and then grab some lunch.  While in the store, I stumbled upon a small, cave-like room with the floor and part of a wall laid in Himalayan Salt bricks that beckoned me in with their glow.  I wandered in, sat in one of the chairs and announced that I would be resting in there for a while.  The energy in the room drew me in and instantly relaxed me. I emerged after about 20 minutes ready to shop, and three hours later we were loading up the car with lamps, salt bars, bath salts and much more.  I already knew that Himalayan Salt Lamps created a blissful environment, but learned so much more just by experiencing the energy shift and relaxing feeling from being in that room.  The store clerk explained how the Himalayan Salt emits negative ions when lit and heated.  These negative ions are actually a good thing because they help dissipate disharmonious energy given off by wifi, computers, cell phones, etc.  (The Inspiration Salt Room)
I truly felt a rebalancing of my my body and mind while I was in that room, and I wanted more!  I came home to San Diego and began my search for a salt cave here that I could go chill in, but to my dismay, the closest ones I could find were in Burbank and Santa Barbara.  I was bummed for a while because I would have to road trip to experience that again, but then I was inspired.  San Diego needs our own Himalayan Salt Cave and I wanted to make that a reality.  I have partnered with two incredible local business women, Jennifer Opaka and Elaine Davis, and we are bringing the bliss to San Diego!
Bliss Cavern
Bliss Cavern will be a unique healing space with dedicated rooms for massage, private yoga, Roll & Release therapy, and a Himalayan Salt Cave.  The heart and soul of Bliss Cavern is the Halogenerator, which grinds salt to nanometer size and pumps it into the room, emulating the conditions inside a natural salt cave, creating a calm, relaxing environment.  Dry salt therapy has been used for years to help people alleviate different types of respiratory and skin conditions.  Himalayan Salt is naturally anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, and anti-microbial and gets deep down into our lungs, so that it cleanses the entire respiratory system including mouth, sinuses, nasal cavities, throat and lungs. The tiny particles of salt will help flush impurities and are perfect for respiratory health.  Originating centuries ago in the natural salt mines of Eastern Europe, salt therapy has spread worldwide and is expanding into the United States....and now to San Diego!  Step into the Bliss Cavern - Salt & Sound Sanctuary for salt therapy sessions, sound healing events, yoga and meditation classes, massage/energy healing and more! 


Bliss Cavern Details:
Bliss Cavern will be approximately 500 square feet in size which is large enough for 15-20 people to sit in the zero gravity reclining chairs, which we will be using for our Relax and Renew sessions.
With your support we will be able to do the following:

Redesign the space and make structural changes to the existing building that will allow us to build out private therapy rooms, as well as the salt cave that will have enough space to fit up to 20 people inside at a time.

Purchase Himalayan Rock Salt to build the internal structure of the salt cave, add a special Halogenerator, and build a dedicated ventilation system that will ensure the air inside the room remains clean and pure.




Install a sound system for all of our service rooms, including the salt cave.




Expand our services to offer a multitude of options, which will include but in no way be limited to, community acupuncture, specialty yoga, meditation, healing movement classes, aromatherapy workshops, sound healing, and vibrational energy workshops. The possibilities are endless


Provide Himalayan Salt retail products including salt lamps, decorative decor, relaxation items, food grade salt and much more.

<p>In 2003, I was looking for a job in Fine Dining after having working in Fine Dining for three months during the summer.  I couldn't get hired because I didn't have enough experience (by a long shot), but Harbor House Seafood Restaurant hired me for their main dining room and welcomed me onto the team.  I was so happy to be working and having a place to call home that I put up a sign welcoming 10 of my new teammates to a rustic Italian dinner at my home.  The group was pretty skeptical of ""the new guy"" who wanted to break bread with his new teammates... but 10 brave souls agreed and came over.  We all ate from about 5pm until 10pm, course after course...  Bruschetta Caprese, Stuffed Mushrooms, Asparagus Frittata, Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Fettucine Florentine, Linguine with a rich Marinara which had meat braising in it all day, then Meatballs, Sausage, Spareribs all fork-tender, a little Swordfish Picata, Caesar Salad, Garlic Cheese Bread, Stuffed Peppers, Eggplant and Zucchini Stew, and then... after I forced them to eat a little fruit (most looked at me like I was sadistic...), I brought out dessert...  Bananas Foster, Turtle Brownies and fresh coffee....  Well, they talked about it for weeks and the Manager, Jim Murphy, came to me one day and said ""So, I hear you like to cook?""  I smiled and said ""Yes sir!  Love it.""  ""If Harbor House paid for the food, would you prepare another party?""  Without even a thought or hesitation, I said ""I would be delighted.""  ""Great!!!  We're auctioning you off for St. Jude's.""  That led to 6 years of being auctioned off to raise money for St. Jude's.  Each year the amount raised increased.  Our last year we raised $5000 for a meal for 20 prepared in their home.</p>
<p>In 2005, I was participating in an exercise in Poland with the Marines.  We were working side by side with the Polish Air Force and they invited us to eat in their chow hall.  I asked to be able to cook for them during our cultural exchange/party.  When I went into their kitchen, there were no large freezers or refrigerators!  I asked and they tried to explain to me (language was an issue for both sides..) that they ordered what they needed, it came in, they prepared it fresh and served it that day.  There was no need for large refrigerators or freezers!  And the food was great!!!  It got me thinking that we should be doing this in America.</p>
<p>I want to cook each day for my neighbors.  I want to be able to offer fresh food that is handmade to people at prices that are meet or beat fast food.  I want to have a team who is commited to feeding the people of the community even in tough times because in America we are supposed to invite everyone to the table.  People matter, money comes and goes... and tough times don't last, but tough people do.</p>

<p>Hello! We are Zack and Sarah, passionate cat lovers and the creators of The Purrfect Cup. In August 2014, we moved to South Korea to teach English. We expected to soak up the culture and experience a whole new and unique world. We knew that cat cafes were all over Korea and Japan and, being cat lovers, we knew we would love them. What we didn't expect was that we would fall in love with the idea of opening our own. </p>

<h3>Share our Dream</h3> <p>Starting any business is no easy task, we are prepared to invest our time and money into creating our dream. We'd love for you to be able to share the dream with us by supporting our campaign.</p>
<p>Your gracious contribution will help us with many of our initial costs, including:</p>

</li></ul>
<p>This is the biggest obstacle we expect to face in our initial start-up phase. We need to find two suitable spaces near, or ideally adjacent to each other, and we also need to renovate the space for The Cat Room to the highest of kitty cat standards. We want The Cat Room to be a safe and comfortable home for our feline friends, and a relaxing and fun environment for our visitors (that's you!).</p>

<p>Our second biggest cost will be purchasing a quality espresso machine. These babies can be as much as $15,000!

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1. What is a cat cafe?</div>
<div>Cat cafes are awesome places where people can order a coffee and then enjoy it in a room filled with cats. Initially popular in Asian countries like Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, they have become increasingly popular in the last year, popping up in California, Portland, London and New York. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2. Is that legal?</div>
<div>The Rhode Island Food Code does not allow animals on the premises of any food establishment. In order to comply with this, The Purrfect Cup will have two separate locations. The Purrfect Cup Cafe will be cat free and solely focus on churning out delicious cups of quality java; while the The Purrfect Cup Cat Room will be your spot for kitty action. By completely separating the food establishment from our feline friends we will ensure compliance with The Code.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3. Will it be sanitary?</div>
<div>Yes! As we mentioned all food and drink preparation will be completely and totally separated from the cats. It will be your choice as to whether or not you bring your beverage into The Cat Room. As a matter of fact if you're not a coffee fan and just want some straight up kitty lovin' you don't even need to visit The Cafe. The safety of our cats and the cleanliness of our facilities are our top priorities, and we believe they go hand in hand. We promise to provide a safe, comfortable and clean space for you and for our cats!  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div> 4<span style=""background-color: initial;"">. Is this safe for the cats?</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This is really important to us. Cats are easily stressed out by large groups of people, and this stress can be really harmful to them. In order to keep our kitties feeling zen we will limit the number of visitors to The Cat Room. We will also have rules in place about how you will be able to interact with the cats, such as, no cat juggling! We will work closely with our veterinarian to ensure that our furry friends are safe, happy and healthy.</span></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5. How will this whole thing work?</div>
<div>In order to enter The Cat Room you will need to pay a cover charge for a 1 hour visit with the cats. This cover charge can be waived with the purchase of a beverage from The Purrfect Cup Cafe (for the same cost). Reservations for The Cat Room will be available online for everyone's convenience.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>6. What happens if you don't reach your funding goal?</div>
<div>If we don't reach our goal we will continue our efforts to open the cafe. Not reaching our goal does NOT mean The Purrfect Cup won't open! It may however mean that the opening will be delayed, so reaching our goal means getting your cat and coffee fix a lot sooner! If, for some unknown reason we are not able to open the cafe the funds we raised during this campaign will be donated to local animal shelters. </div> <p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Rhode Island's First Cat Cafe!
The Purrfect Cup  will be the purrfect place for customers to enjoy Rhode Island’s favorite beverage, coffee, with America’s favorite animal at their side. We're hoping to provide a cat lovers paradise for one of America's best cities.

    

Hello! We are Zack and Sarah, passionate cat lovers and the creators of The Purrfect Cup. In August 2014, we moved to South Korea to teach English. We expected to soak up the culture and experience a whole new and unique world. We knew that cat cafes were all over Korea and Japan and, being cat lovers, we knew we would love them. What we didn't expect was that we would fall in love with the idea of opening our own. 


The minute we went to our first cat cafe we both knew this was what we wanted to do. 


Making friends at our first cat cafe

We spend much of our free time researching and planning our dream. We've also made sure to visit as many cat cafes as we can...for research of course >^..^<We hope to open The Purrfect Cup Cafe and Cat Room side by side in downtown Providence in early 2016.

<h4>Home Security</h4>
<p>The modular camera design will allow for further functionality even if you are not wearing it. Dock the camera into its wall mounted charging station and  D6 transforms into a home monitoring device capable of recognizing people, performing analytics and alerting you of any unusual situations at home in real-time. Through the app you will even be able to access the live camera feed and always keep an eye on what matters most. </p>

<br/><p>Real-time security streaming will capture possible alerts, describe them with words, and save the footage in a separate file, thus making it easier to review without having to sit in front of a screen fast forwarding and rewinding through endless footage. And all while simultaneously performing deep analysis of events to present a more robust understanding of what took place - such as distinguishing from trusted individuals and strangers. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>The core technology behind the D6 camera allows you to have the peace of mind that comes from having an expensive state of the art home monitoring system at a fraction of the price and size. You will no longer need to deal with the hassle of installing bulky cameras in your home; the simple to use and compact design of the D6 camera allows you to protect, both quickly and conveniently, what matters most. </p>

<h2><span>The Digital 6 Technology</span></h2>
<span>To deliver results, the most advanced VPAs employ the use of predictive analysis. However taking advantage of users’ geographical location, search terms, and web browsing history alone limits these VPAs’ ability to generate accurate predictions, as they remain blind to the interactions taking place amidst the users' surroundings.  Furthermore, in an effort to learn user behavior, traditional VPAs habitually store massive quantities of personal data in the cloud - a practice that continues to raise privacy concerns and fears of cyber-attacks.  </span><br/>

<p><br/></p>
<span>To prevent any privacy issues, D6 will not be collecting and storing your entire digital footprint like most personal assistants currently do. D6 will take the camera's input and your location information to quickly learn your preferences and deliver accurate recommendations.  To further mitigate privacy concerns, our team has developed additional technology that has the dual benefit of giving D6 an extra layer of encryption to protect all sensitive data, and also allowing it to map and access your preferences quickly in order to improve the relevance of its recommendations.</span><br/></span></div>

Meet Digital 6

Digital 6 (D6) is Skyvine’s ultimate virtual personal assistant (VPA). Unlike any other VPAs available on the market, D6 is not only designed to actively learn from you, but also programmed to digest information at an unprecedented rate. Let the A.I. spend time with you, and your life will never be the same. Through technology that maintains security and privacy, D6 uses your taste and preferences to:


Curate information relevant to you

Improve every aspect of your social life
Escort you to new and exciting experiences





The unique aspect of Digital 6 is that it remembers your preferences to help provide you with better suggestions. Curated information such as restaurant recommendations, deal alerts, news articles, and other relevant data will be matched to your specific interests to help make your life more convenient.  D6 patent pending proprietary technology goes a step further. Embedded into a multi-functional camera, it also harnesses vision to make inferences, thus delivering more holistic and accurate predictions. As the old saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. 




The Digital 6 App





Curating InformationThe unique aspect of D6 is that it remembers your preferences in order to provide you with the most pertinent recommendations. Curated details are displayed on an easy-to-use app with the goal of cutting down on time spent sifting through irrelevant content.
  




Socializing
Socializing with current friends or meeting new people has never been easier. D6 highlights the common interests you and your friends share and offers its suggestions with them in mind. Interested in expanding your social network? D6 can also propose new contacts recommendations given your preferences and interests.



Exploring
Explore your environment with the help of D6. Discover local events, activities, and trends. Alternatively, create your own event and invite friends to join.  Need to grab a bite before or after the event? Let D6 recommend new restaurants, as it uses its technology to consider not only your preferences but also places where you have eaten in the past.

The Digital 6 Camera





Home Security
The modular camera design will allow for further functionality even if you are not wearing it. Dock the camera into its wall mounted charging station and  D6 transforms into a home monitoring device capable of recognizing people, performing analytics and alerting you of any unusual situations at home in real-time. Through the app you will even be able to access the live camera feed and always keep an eye on what matters most. 


Real-time security streaming will capture possible alerts, describe them with words, and save the footage in a separate file, thus making it easier to review without having to sit in front of a screen fast forwarding and rewinding through endless footage. And all while simultaneously performing deep analysis of events to present a more robust understanding of what took place - such as distinguishing from trusted individuals and strangers. 



The core technology behind the D6 camera allows you to have the peace of mind that comes from having an expensive state of the art home monitoring system at a fraction of the price and size. You will no longer need to deal with the hassle of installing bulky cameras in your home; the simple to use and compact design of the D6 camera allows you to protect, both quickly and conveniently, what matters most. 
Wearable

The D6 companion camera is highly functional, serving as your second set of eyes to help you navigate through your busy day.




The camera’s functions include:

The ability to learn about your immediate environment
The ability to keep track of your belongings -  alerting you if you are about to leave an item behind
The ability to locate misplaced items - such as keys, glasses or even your wallet
The ability to detect faces - such as those of your friends and family





Tentative Specs


The Digital 6 Technology
To deliver results, the most advanced VPAs employ the use of predictive analysis. However taking advantage of users’ geographical location, search terms, and web browsing history alone limits these VPAs’ ability to generate accurate predictions, as they remain blind to the interactions taking place amidst the users' surroundings.  Furthermore, in an effort to learn user behavior, traditional VPAs habitually store massive quantities of personal data in the cloud - a practice that continues to raise privacy concerns and fears of cyber-attacks.  





To prevent any privacy issues, D6 will not be collecting and storing your entire digital footprint like most personal assistants currently do. D6 will take the camera's input and your location information to quickly learn your preferences and deliver accurate recommendations.  To further mitigate privacy concerns, our team has developed additional technology that has the dual benefit of giving D6 an extra layer of encryption to protect all sensitive data, and also allowing it to map and access your preferences quickly in order to improve the relevance of its recommendations.



We Need Your Help

We are asking for $200,000 to acquire the proper equipment to prototype the camera before production. Current tests have been run using cellphone cameras and development boards, and have proven to be successful; we are ready to begin implementing the technology into a compact camera. Before we finalize on a production model, we would like to obtain fan feedback and additional inputs on the camera and its design, to deliver a product that not only users like, but that will also help them become more efficient. The funds raised will go directly into implementing your suggestions into the final product.  

The Perks
Indiegogo supporters will receive an exclusive Indiegogo version of D6 at a discounted price.

Development and Timelines

Progress and Milestones

Over the past year our team has been developing and testing the core technology that will make D6 a reality.

Milestone 1: Image recognition



     


We trained the A.I. to analyze images for a
short period of time. We then proceeded to test its learning capabilities. After downloading random images from the internet, we then let the A.I. process them using a
short analysis time frame to simulate real time interactions. In the above example, the A.I. successfully determined the animal species in the picture in less than thirty seconds. 



Milestone 2: Enhanced Analytical Abilities


We trained the A.I. to successfully recognize never before seen images. The team then developed the A.I's linguistic and analytical capabilities.



                  

To test the A.I.'s enhanced analytical abilities, the team employed images such as the one depicted above. The A.I. was able to simultaneously recognize a person, the color of the person's shirt, and the plane in the background. Additionally, the A.I. wrote a sentence describing the picture in detail. 


Milestone 3: Item Location Mapping

To help D6 better navigate its environment, the team
developed additional technology allowing it to track the position of
different items from pictures taken at different angles. 


              


This technology does not only help D6 keep track of your items, but it also gives D6 access to the elusive depth dimension, allowing it to learn and navigate the world more efficiently.


Milestone 4: Mobile Device Integration
To simulate the D6 camera, the team integrated the A.I. into a smartphone. 


The above demo shows the A.I.'s analytical capabilities in real time. While the A.I. had never previously seen these specific objects, it demonstrated its ability to accurately recognize them nonetheless.  The demo also confirms the A.I's ability to be integrated into low power devices.


Milestone 5: Video Analysis

Upon achieving mobile device integration, the team
proceeded to develop and test the A.I.'s video analytics capabilities, which
will play an integral role in its home security applications. 





In the demo above, the A.I. successfully detected and assigned a
unique ID number to the car entering the driveway as well as the one driving
passed it. This technology will be employed to not only recognize familiar
vehicles, such as those belonging to friends and family, but to also alert of
unusual circumstances, such as those that could arise when an unknown van is detected loitering in front of a house.  






In the above demonstration, the cellphone camera zoomed in to record the
concluding moments of a soccer match, just as the players begin to walk out of the
field. The results capture high levels of video noise. Yet, even within the confines of poor quality footage, the A.I. recognized and tagged the different soccer players and assigned each of them an individual ID. This technology will empower D6 to sound an alarm when a stranger breaks into the house but not when a pet runs in from an open window. 

Milestone 6:  Vision Enhancement
After performing several image and video analysis tests, the team assessed that the limitations of low cost camera components had a significant impact on the A.I.'s ability to learn and navigate the surrounding environment. Through the development of two distinct algorithms, one centered around image de-noising, and the other around lighting enhancement, however, these limitations where reduced to a minimum.   



The example above shows an image taken with an old, inexpensive cellphone. The picture at the top is riddled with noise caused by the poor lighting environment. As the A.I. processes it, employing both the image de-noising and lighting enhancement technologies, however, the image quality becomes comparable to that of the same picture, shot at the same time, but using a high-end DSLR camera.  






In the works



The team is currently working on milestone 7, 8 and 9.

Milestone 7:  The Digital 6 App

This milestone will be achieved upon completion of the Digital 6 application. Currently, the projected timeline to reach this milestone stands at approximately 8 months (~April 2016)


Milestone 8:  The Digital 6 Camera: Home Security

Will the camera water-proof?
While the camera will be able to withstand life in the outdoors, such as exposure to raindrops and snow flakes, it will cease to function if placed under water. 


Risks & Challenges

The process of taking a technical device from prototype to mass production is complex and time-demanding. This is especially true when a lot of innovation is built into a digital product. 
From finding the right Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partners, some of whom the team has already identified and engaged with, to complying with FCC and CE certification standards, a task often delayed by lengthy quality control and approval processes, the challenges can be many. 
With a vast patents and publications portfolio, and experience ranging from coding complex algorithms to developing novel technologies, however, the D6 team is not only committed to overcoming all hurdles, both foreseen and unforeseen, but also prepared to do so most effectively.   
Support from the IndieGoGo community will be instrumental as D6 morphs from an abstract concept into a reality.",18.0,3,"1 Campaign

</div><p>           We have a two part campaign that facilitates moving an idea of ours forward while creating an entrepreneurial environment for the Hopi Nation. The Hopis have lived in North America longer than any other group of people. We have dubbed our project the <strong>Spider Initiative</strong> to pay homage to the Hopi Spider Woman, who is the Mother of Creation in their belief system. An outgrowth and added benefit of our project will also create an opportunity for other enterprising individuals to start their own businesses by using the finished product from the joint venture.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>(MORE EXPLANITION VIDEOS IN GALLERY)</strong></p><div>
</div><p><strong>First things first, what is your idea?</strong></p><div>
</div><p><strong>        </strong>The creative spirit in us allowed us to create the definitive mobile on-site garment screen printing machine. Almost anyone can operate this machine anytime and anywhere, and create quality multi-colored shirts the right way. Everyone who has witnessed and experienced the process has loved it. Experimentation and practical use has now perfected the process and  created the ProfitPrinter mobile on-site printing machine.</p><p><br/></p><div>
</div><p><strong>What happened next?</strong></p><div>
</div><p><strong>         </strong>People<strong> </strong>started asking us to sell them one of our mobile on-site printing machines. We heard from Guam, Nova Scotia, Florida, England, New York and many more places. No advertising, just word of mouth.</p><div>
</div><p><strong>So, is that why we are here?</strong></p><div>
</div><p>         Exactly. People around the world started asking to buy something we build and were willing to pay good money for it. And as I said, with no advertising. We have built the machines ourselves for years and now have an inspired idea to create a production facility and do massive good at the same time. But we need your help.</p><div>
</div><p><strong>Is this where the Hopi Nation comes in?</strong></p><div>
</div><p>         We have worked with the Hopi Nation for years doing garments and events. The Hopi people are incredibly gracious, talented, and creative people. In fact the word Hopi means peaceful. Their unique spiritual culture has survived in these harsh lands for over 1500 years. They have fought off the Spaniards, Mexicans, and other tribes to live on and cultivate their farming-based society. Yet, since the intervention of the U.S. Government, they have watched their proud and honorable ways disappear and be replaced by social programs. There is little industry on their land to keep the young, talented and educated students home to keep their culture and beliefs flowing. The Hopis are facing what a millenneum and more of aggression could not accomplish, the decimation of their beliefs and ways. There is little to fill the economic needs of their citizens, both young and old.</p><div>
</div><p>         So, rather than build our machines through the standard channels, we have talked with the Tribal Council and asked them if they would like to create a small production facility to build ProfitPrinters not only in America, but by the original natives of our land. Not only can they build our machines, but they can fabricate other items that will be of use by their people. Made in Hopi, by Hopis, for Hopis. The main focus is to create a culture where people learn to embrace the entreprenuerial spirit and take ideas and create their own opportunities once again. Then we will take the model that they created and share it with others who need a chance to succeed.</p><div>
</div><p><strong>Is this where I fit in?</strong></p><div>
</div><p><strong>    </strong>     In order to help the Hopi people and to build our machines, we are asking your help in funding the project in a grass roots manner. The Hopis have found a workable building to convert and we have assembled an ambitious group to make it become an actuality. We still need the following:</p><div>
</div><p><strong>Inventory</strong> as in steel, motors, heaters, etc.</p><div>
</div><p><strong>Shop Renovation</strong> and retrofitting.</p><div>
</div><p><strong>Equipment/</strong>welders and such.</p><div>
</div><p><strong>Training</strong> in both business and welding practices.</p><div>
</div><p><strong>Website</strong> creation and management.</p><div>
</div><p><strong>Powder Coat Booth</strong> implementation.</p><div>
</div><p><strong>Miscellaneous Expenses</strong> such as andministration, travel, etc.</p><div>
</div><p><br/></p><div>
</div><p><strong>So...what is the bottom line?</strong><br/></p><div>
</div><p>            In order to get the project bare-bone funded, we need your help in raising at least $22,000 USD to renovate and get the basic equipment in place. To build it out completely to where they have the powder coating capabilities and are completely self sufficient to use the shop to build other items for the nation will be $65,000 USD. We are asking for the minimum to make sure we have the process moving forward and then we will continue to push the rest along. Of course the more we raise, the quicker we get the project rolling to make money and create opportunity.</p><div>
</div><p><strong>What happens when you meet your goal?</strong></p><div>
</div><p>        Nothing but good things, with hard meaningful work. Our crew will partner with the Hopi crew to take a 100 year old building and turn it into a functioning production facility. This means painting, plumbing, electrical, and all the good stuff. Then we add the safety guidelines, and we start teaching people who had no creative outlet to create.</p><div>
</div><p>        It might not be the cheapest way for us to build the machines, but it IS the right way to do them. We believe that businesss only works if everyone wins. Then, the Hopis start building ProfitPrinters and other items such as railings, handrails, and canopies.</p><div>
</div><p><strong>What is ProfitPrinter exactly?</strong></p><div>
</div><p><strong>       </strong>Good question. It is a go anywhere, 4 color portable screen printing machine with its own infra-red conveyor oven built right in to take care of any printing needs in remote locations. Why would you need that? Because there are tens of thousands of opportunities to print directly at events. That not only saves you inventory problems, but earns you full retail price for your shirts -and it's mostly cash. Your event host does not need to worry about buying ahead of time, design and inventory costs, and bad weather. It frees them up to do what they do best. It's a classic win-win situation.</p><div>
</div><p><strong>These machines look like the could be fun and profitable...</strong></p><div>
</div><p>         That they are! If you like freedom in your life, enjoy traveling a bit, and like to talk to new people, then they are a kick in the butt. Plus you make serious change doing it.</p><div>

   Challenges

Most of the organizations that have set up shelters in India do not have a strong online presence. Therefore, we need to go through each state’s approved service providers manually. 
Now with the country being divided into 30 states, more attention should be given to cities as well as rural areas.

The Impact 

Primarily, the funds would be used to support Chayn India’s research group who’ll be hired particularly to collect information about women shelters more accurately and effectively. 
Any and all remnants of the funds raised from the campaign will be added to the Chayn Empowerment Fund which will be used in emergency situations when women who approach Chayn seeking support, shelter or help

The building that houses The Primitive Studio was built in the 1930's and has recently been restored.  The location provides a unique, atmosphere for workshops, seminars, or rehearsal space as well as a showcase for art and live performances.  <br/><br/>The Primitive Studio will provide the Gainesville and surrounding communities with a unique center of innovation to experience

Sam feels confident that the impact of The Primitive Studio will be an extraordinary, unique reflection of Gainesville's identity. <br/><br/>As co-founder and Digital Media and Sound Production Director, Iver Thue brings a Studio and Video Production degree from The Art Institute and 6 years of digital production experience to The Primitive Studio. He has directed film, video and animation projects for many local and national clients.   Iver is also a  professional musician, and has toured the country performing in live shows and in the studio since the late 1990's.  <br/><br/>Lisa Demanuel, co-founder and CEO, has over twenty years of experience in production design, marketing, public relations, and business management.  She began her career traveling around the country coordinating hair and fashion shows for Aveda, Revlon, and Clairol.  Since coming to Gainesville  she has worked as an Account Executive for an advertising firm, and was the Marketing and Promotions Director for a local radio station where she helped to launch Radio Disney in the Gainesville market.  Lisa will be instrumental in our community outreach programs, business management, and will add her creative touch to The Primitive Studio. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The City of Gainesville is a known supporter of music and the visual arts.  Although,  Gainesville is home to three active main-stage theaters and a performing arts center, 
there is not a viable, local venue for artists to showcase what they do 
and the chance to share it with the local community.<br/><br/>While our area has a lot to offer culturally, we know there are certain risks involved in any venture of this kind. That being said, we strongly believe we bring a unique and transcendent experience to our cultural and artistic landscape. The Primitive Studio will push the boundaries of production and performance. We have already <br/>scheduled two main performances and numerous workshops for the space beginning in late June 2015.  We have a short film in development, and two web based tutorial series to produce.  Work on our first projection mapping insulation is in the animation phase and we have two gallery exhibits in the works for late summer, early fall.  We feel confident we will be profitable within 3 months of opening our doors if not sooner.<br/><br/>But, we need your help!  we can't do this without start-up funds to finish renovations of our space and open the doors.  <br/><br/>

He has directed film, video and animation projects for many local and national clients.   Iver is also a  professional musician, and has toured the country performing in live shows and in the studio since the late 1990's.  Lisa Demanuel, co-founder and CEO, has over twenty years of experience in production design, marketing, public relations, and business management.  She began her career traveling around the country coordinating hair and fashion shows for Aveda, Revlon, and Clairol.  Since coming to Gainesville  she has worked as an Account Executive for an advertising firm, and was the Marketing and Promotions Director for a local radio station where she helped to launch Radio Disney in the Gainesville market.  Lisa will be instrumental in our community outreach programs, business management, and will add her creative touch to The Primitive Studio. 
  Risks & ChallengesThe City of Gainesville is a known supporter of music and the visual arts.  Although,  Gainesville is home to three active main-stage theaters and a performing arts center, 
there is not a viable, local venue for artists to showcase what they do 
and the chance to share it with the local community.While our area has a lot to offer culturally, we know there are certain risks involved in any venture of this kind. That being said, we strongly believe we bring a unique and transcendent experience to our cultural and artistic landscape. The Primitive Studio will push the boundaries of production and performance. We have already scheduled two main performances and numerous workshops for the space beginning in late June 2015.  We have a short film in development, and two web based tutorial series to produce.  Work on our first projection mapping insulation is in the animation phase and we have two gallery exhibits in the works for late summer, early fall.  We feel confident we will be profitable within 3 months of opening our doors if not sooner.But, we need your help!  we can't do this without start-up funds to finish renovations of our space and open the doors.  
  Other Ways You Can HelpAnyone can help! If you can't contribute financially you can donate items and or volunteer your time or skills to help us build and grow!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Philosophy</b></p>
<p><b>P</b>rofessionally <b>R</b>esponsible <b>I</b>n <b>D</b>elivering<b>
E</b>xcellence that’s our philosophy and it’s based on the legendary Golden
Rule of “treating people as you want to be treated.” Building and maintaining a
thriving, healthy, loyal and satisfied customer base is the pinnacle of our
business model and the most critical factor in our overall success. PRIDE’s
ambiance, culture, products, and services have all been tailored to provide our
clients with a professional atmosphere where world-class grooming services and
products are the standard. In addition to making our clients look good, our
amenities will also provide our clients with the opportunity to conduct business, socialize, or simply relax and recharge while enjoying our lounge-like atmosphere and their beverage of choice.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Many barbershops have become a place filled with less than
acceptable customer service, a lackluster approach to maintenance and
cleanliness, and an atmosphere that leaves a lot to be desired. How many times
have you entered into a shop looking for your barber...or any barber for that
fact, you stand at the front for minutes on end and right before you’re about
to do an about face and walk out, someone grunts and points to a sign-in sheet,
yeah you guessed it...the grunt translates into, “you need to sign in.” That’s
unacceptable and that’s your introduction to their shop, really? You deserve
more, and more is the standard at PRIDE.</p>
<p>For centuries, the barbershop was more than a place to just
get a haircut or shave. Its served as a hub of the community where men came
together to socialize, bond, and exchange ideas on a myriad of topics. That
communal camaraderie, old-fashioned quality, customer service, and passion for
creating an environment that fosters this level of interaction is hard to find.</p>
<p>PRIDE effectively fills this void with a modern and
multicultural approach. Whether you’re stopping in for a cut and a shave, to
have a drink, or just to enjoy the environment and amenities. From the time
that you arrive, you'll take notice to the modern decor, brushed steel fixtures,
stained concrete flooring, leather couches, wall art, unique sculptures, and
flat screen televisions all highlighting the fact that PRIDE is as much a place
to meet, talk, relax, and do business as it’s a place to get a haircut.</p>
<p>PRIDE offers a superior alternative to the sports themed,
super, fantastic salon/barber chains that you’ll find in your local strip mall.
Generally speaking, the majority of the individuals working in these salons are
cosmetologist whose training is geared towards catering to women’s hair and
using scissors, not clippers…the main tool used in cutting men’s hair! PRIDE
has highly skilled and experienced barbers trained to service any hair type and
texture with the highest level of quality. </p>
<p>Customarily, PRIDE barbers will ask you questions about your
day, how you’d like your haircut, daily grooming regime, and any changes to
your hairstyle that you’d like to make. Leveraging their industry training and
experience, our barbers are able to provide you with advice on a wide range of
grooming/styling topics and issues. These additional steps taken by our barbers
to get to know their clients and foster open and effective communication are
all geared towards creating a look that you can take PRIDE in, and establishing
a long lasting relationship.</p>

Our Story

This all started several years ago while working with inner city youth in Lansing, MI. We began to hear story after story of the difficulties of finding employment as well as the desire to work.  Many teens and young adults we talked with expressed the need to support themselves, their families, to stay out of trouble or to just move forward in life.  The very real obstacles they faced boiled down to a couple of primary issues; job experience and employment training.  The truth is, these issues are not unique to the Lansing area.  The current unemployment rate for youth across America is 19% with the inner city being some of the toughest areas for young people to find employment.  You can read more on this topic at the links below.

A little over a year ago The 517 Coffee Company was born.  As parents, aspiring business owners and members of our community, we set out with a goal to just do something, no matter how small, and do it well.  We invested what we had and continue to invest to sustain our business and work towards our social mission. 

Today we are poised to move forward with our social mission.  To make that happen we are looking to raise funds for two things.  

1) A commercial roaster ($7,000-$8,000). Currently we are roasting with home equipment, turning out 8oz. of fresh roasted specialty coffee every 35 minutes.  With a commercial roaster we are looking to increase production to about 5 pounds every 15 minutes.  This will allow us to keep up with demand, increase our sales volume and profits so we can re-invest in youth internships and employment opportunities.  

2) Funds to begin offering paid internships ($2,000+).  We are extremely motivated and excited to roll out our first youth internship this summer.  Internships are for the benefit of the intern not our business.  Our internships will be focused on learning together what is needed for each individual intern to be successful.  Together we will discover individual strengths, passions and goals.  We will equip our interns with employment and life skills like: resume building, interviewing skills, professional etiquette, work ethic, personal finance and social responsibility.

<p>The physic of Slacklining and its variations, is different compared to any other sport. A properly set up and tensioned longline has a static load equivalent to 500-1200 kg and on top of it there is an additional dynamic stress when somebody is walking or jumping on the webbing.</p>
<p>In many cases people tend to use inappropriate equipment, which is not produced and/or tested for slackline use, such as aluminium carabiners and pulleys often used for climbing. These are rated for one person weight only and usually exclude the additional tension load of a longline, even though their tested tensile strength is over the expected load.</p>
<p>Aluminium is a rigid material. Once you drop an aluminium equipment from a larger height you cannot fully trust it any more, as the stress from a drop can cause invisible cracks in its structure.</p>
<p>Yield strength of aluminium (the stress at which a material begins deforming plastically) is close to its ultimate tensile strength (the force under which the material brakes) and its elongation before break is just about 11%. In a case like this, it’s not possible to note if your equipment is overloaded before it fails.</p>
<p>For your safety we have decided not to use aluminium parts in cases where these parts are continuously exposed to heavy loads and additional dynamic loads.</p>
<p>Stainless steel’s tensile strength is pretty much the same as the 7075 aluminium but its yield strength is much lower, therefore the elongation at break is about 50-70%. This means that when you overload your system the deformation would be noticeable, as a result of the system not being used properly. Visible deformation appears much before it fails so you can note that. This way, it’s easier and safer to follow the history of the equipment and make the decision about trusting it in the future.</p>
<p>Aluminium has been used in cases, where there are no big dynamic forces. We use 7075 high strength aluminium alloy, used in climbing equipment, as well as aircraft construction and bicycle parts. All of these aluminium parts are hard anodized which adds more durability to them and brings their properties closer to those of hard faced or case hardened steel.</p>
<p>The main parts which will be exposed to heavy loads are constructed from high strength stainless steel (1.4301 and 1.4571). These are durable, and everlasting materials that match the outdoor use and increase safety.</p>
<p>The combination of these high-tech materials makes ZERGE outdoor equipment perfect for slacklining.</p>

</div></div>","Dear Friends in Slacklining,I’m a keen slackliner and slackline equipment developer. I made several prototypes of slackline equipment, which we've been using for years with group of friends in the Outdoor Inhales Team.Many years of experience in rigging longlines and
highlines led us to the final concept.Now we proudly present the ZERGE product range –
safe, functional and high quality equipment.
ZERO - the ultimate solution for a leash ring.The main function of this new concept is to shape and support the loop of the leash, and protect both the webbing and the leash rope from abrasion damage.The leash rope fits into the U-shaped channel of the ring in order to avoid direct contact with the webbing. Compared to other rings, ZERO’s contact area with the webbing is much bigger which means that the forces are equally distributed on the webbing.When the leash rope is not exposed to additional tension, the accessory cord keeps it secured in its place. In a fall situation the additional tension tightens the rope around the ring, therefore keeping it firm without any chance of slipping away.It arrives with an accessory pouch, for safe keeping. And just a small tip - in case you forget or lose the accessory cord for Zero you can always use the one from the pouch.The way ZERO is designed to distribute the load is allowing it to be more compact.  For additional safety it is forged from a solid block of high-strength stainless steel, which makes it extremely durable and bomb-proof and still lighter than many other steel rings on the market.
Want to go ultralight? In this case ZERO BLACK is perfect for you. It’s machined from 7075 aircraft quality aluminium alloy with hard anodized finish for additional strength, endurance, and wear resistance. It weighs less than 80 grams, which is less than half of the weight of the lightest steel ring on the market. It’s really a “must have” piece in every ultralight system.


The concept for MINI is to be compact and highly-efficient rigging pulley system at the same time. Compared to the common 5:1 pulley system setups with 9-11mm diameter ropes this pulley system is 9:1 and is designed for the 8mm RIG STATIC rope.In other words, the system needs more rope with a reduced diameter. Effectively the system weighs the same but the rigging is almost two times more efficient.Using the triple, double and simple pulleys as multipliers you will be able to rig more than 100-meter-long line on your own.The force is better distributed, there is less load on the rope brake which makes the system safer. The brake’s special design allows high-performance when rigging but also much better control over the rope when releasing.The side plates, axles, bolts, shackles and maillons are made from high-strength stainless steel. The highly efficient bearings are also made from stainless steel for maximum safety and durability.The webbing anchors are made for 25mm polyester or polyamide webbings. These heavy-duty anchors also provide safe rigging for longlines over 100m. The 28mm diameter middle roller is made from hard anodized 7075 aluminium alloy. It is secured with an extra bolt to make its use safer, and prevent from turning around under high loads, which can make the webbing slip off. Because of its big diameter the roller makes the locking with the webbing highly efficient.The front pin is made from high-strength stainless steel and has a quick release button for easy use. It makes the rigging and pre-tensioning a lot easier.




This lightweight rope has been especially designed for longline rigging.
We reduced the rope diameter which made it much lighter and at the same time this did not affect its performance. We are using a high quality polyester with an improved structure with very low stretch and high strength properties. In effect the rope has high performance in rigging and it’s easier to control in the brake because of its good grip characteristics.
The rope cover is also made from polyester which protects it from abrasion and UV exposure. The rope is heat-treated for additional elongation reduction.RIG STATIC is developed especially for the MINI pulley system, but it can also be used together with other pulleys. This rope is made for rigging, DO NOT use it for climbing!





Do you want to protect your equipment and keep it organized anytime? ZIP is an improved rope bag optimized for longline and highline rigging. It’s a perfect storage for your MINI rigging system, but it is also suitable for other pulley systems.

It is secured with an extra bolt to make its use safer and prevent turning around at high loads which can make the webbing slip off. Because of its big diameter the roller makes the locking with the webbing highly efficient.
The front pin is made from high-strength stainless steel and has a quick release button for easy use. It makes the rigging and pre-tensioning a lot easier.





SKIP is the first full Stainless Steel highly efficient webbing pulley on the market. Suitable for 1inch / 25mm wide flat webbings. It can be used as a multiplier in an Ellington tightening system or as a transport pulley.All the parts including the high-performance bearings are made of stainless steel for maximum safety and durability. It is guaranteed that the bearings won’t get rusty and damage the surface of the webbing. Compared to other aluminium pulleys it’s much more resistant to abrasion caused by the wedding. There is an additional 4mm diameter cord hole on the side plate which helps you to attach and store your gear.



*Note that the final products will be the same as seen on the 3D models and there will be further engravings of safety instructions (not shown in the pictures).




Materials we use
The physic of Slacklining and its variations, is different compared to any other sport. A properly set up and tensioned longline has a static load equivalent to 500-1200 kg and on top of it there is an additional dynamic stress when somebody is walking or jumping on the webbing.
In many cases people tend to use inappropriate equipment, which is not produced and/or tested for slackline use, such as aluminium carabiners and pulleys often used for climbing. These are rated for one person weight only and usually exclude the additional tension load of a longline, even though their tested tensile strength is over the expected load.
Aluminium is a rigid material. Once you drop an aluminium equipment from a larger height you cannot fully trust it any more, as the stress from a drop can cause invisible cracks in its structure.
Yield strength of aluminium (the stress at which a material begins deforming plastically) is close to its ultimate tensile strength (the force under which the material brakes) and its elongation before break is just about 11%. In a case like this, it’s not possible to note if your equipment is overloaded before it fails.
For your safety we have decided not to use aluminium parts in cases where these parts are continuously exposed to heavy loads and additional dynamic loads.
Stainless steel’s tensile strength is pretty much the same as the 7075 aluminium but its yield strength is much lower, therefore the elongation at break is about 50-70%. This means that when you overload your system the deformation would be noticeable, as a result of the system not being used properly. Visible deformation appears much before it fails so you can note that. This way, it’s easier and safer to follow the history of the equipment and make the decision about trusting it in the future.
Aluminium has been used in cases, where there are no big dynamic forces. We use 7075 high strength aluminium alloy, used in climbing equipment, as well as aircraft construction and bicycle parts. All of these aluminium parts are hard anodized which adds more durability to them and brings their properties closer to those of hard faced or case hardened steel.
The main parts which will be exposed to heavy loads are constructed from high strength stainless steel (1.4301 and 1.4571). These are durable, and everlasting materials that match the outdoor use and increase safety.
The combination of these high-tech materials makes ZERGE outdoor equipment perfect for slacklining.

<h3>
<i>Our Mach 1.5 Glider will Open the Door to Sending Payloads Cheaply to Space.</i><br/>
</h3>
<p>We are building spacecraft to make that possible we need to conduct test flights. The first flight is a supersonic glider that is set to break the sound barrier and coincidentally, world records. This is not a spacecraft, but essential for the next phase. We are also launching it from nearly half way to space. The craft is designed to easily break the sound barrier for supersonic and transonic tests and is expected to reach Mach 1.5 or nearly 2,000kph / 1,250mph. That is fast and designed to capture the world's imagination. It is also to prove the reliability of our systems our remote control pilot will be an accomplished 13 year old who will be firmly on the ground. If he gets into difficulties, The craft will take over and automatically land itself.<br/><br/>The glider will be flown in Australia later in the year and you can be in the virtual cockpit during the record breaking flight, seeing what the pilot is seeing. Be there as we topple world records and test our systems ready for building our spacecraft - a winged re-entry vehicle. All of this takes time and money, but the money is small and the time is now.<br/></p> <p>Hi, I am Robert Brand and I have worked in space communications and space industry for most of my life and as an aerospace engineer for the last few years. I worked on Apollo 11 communications, Voyager encounters for NASA and ESA's Giotto mission to Halleys comet. I have an award for Shuttle STS-1 support that was personally given to me by Commander John Young. <br/></p>
<p>We have a great team behind the project and there is one member that you really need to meet. He is the Mach 1.5 remote control glider pilot: Jason Brand. He is 13 years old and will fly the fastest small craft privately built and he has done much of the design work! He will even create a sonic boom! Why a 13 year old pilot? Because we are building the X-2A systems to be very responsive. We know that even a 13 year old will be able to control and fly the craft. It is a demonstration in its own right. It is also a testimony to STEM education. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430727157/ik2e8wtdc96ktokrdg9h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Above: Jason's appearance on Australia's Sunrise TV program.<br/><br/>Please check out our full team in the team info tab as they are the key to our success. Despite the fact that Jason has the final say on design, the team offers suggestions, does a lot of the higher level maths (thanks Todd) and finds the problems in the design and mission profile so that we eliminate failures points. Many of us have been working on earlier space mission projects. We have the skill set to ensure success.<br/><br/><p>Robert, Jason and many in the team also launch high altitude weather balloons. They release them, track them and recover the scientific payloads. Robert &amp; Jason have conducted 23 flights and recovered all 23 payloads with a world record of 100% recovery.. These flights often make it to 33.3km altitude. That is 1/3 the way to space. We plan on using that experience to carry out test, much the same as NASA used the X craft to test and create the space shuttle. <br/></p>
<p>We can't afford massive aircraft like a B-52 to get us to altitude and we can't afford to build craft like the X-15, but we don't have to nor do we want to. We can achieve supersonic  flights for under $20,000 once we are set up and we can even get a payload to space for under $60,000 (sounding flight). We are expecting that to be our second flight. Of course setting up for the first flight and refining the subsequent systems is more expensive and that is why we are flying our craft that we have code named the X-2A. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How can we Help Each Other?</h3>We need to raise <b>A$80,000</b>, but you also get the <b>Rewards</b><br/>
<p></p>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;""> <p>Here are some of the big items we need:</p> <ul>
<li>2 x Zero pressure balloons A$40,000 (half the budget)<br/>
</li> <li>2 x GPS capable of greater than Mach 1.5  A$20,000</li>
<li>2 x Radar transponders A$10,000</li>
<li>The rest: Helium A$2,000; travel A$3,000; Airframe A$2,000; Civil Aviation Safety Authority Fees A$1,000 and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot more that we need and we are hoping that your generosity will raise more than the A$80,000. The Perks that we have organised will be great and some items may one day become valuable as we will grow to become an important player in the space sector. Check out the rewards in our Perks section!</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3>What will we achieve?<br/>
</h3> <p>Although the funding is for the first flight that is essential for the next stage - the flight to space, you will be directly contributing to designing spacecraft. Along with the balloon, stage 2 we expect will be a sounding rocket flight above 100km - the internationally recognised start of space.<br/></p> <ul> <li>This will cut costs to micro gravity experiments, especially those needed in the manufacture of important medicines and new science experiments.</li>
<li>It will also show the importance of STEM education. </li>
</ul>
<p>The ThunderStruck spacecraft that results from this will be very different. For those that understand flight/space. the wings will have dihedral and lift. The X-2A has neither. The spacecraft, when used as a sounding craft launched from a balloon will have a rocket in its tail. It will also have a lifting body and cold gas thrusters to keep it controllable in space. The sounding craft version will only need minor heat shielding and its design will make it reusable.<br/></p>

</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>This Video will Help Explain the X-2A Project</h3>
<p>We recently were on the Australian Channel 7 Sunrise Program with a 5 minute interview. There are a few errors, but it will explain a lot. Remember, the launch is Sept 2015 and we are not building a manned craft. We see the niche business as one of building a space courier business. We take it up or bring it back! Enjoy the interview with these things in mind.</p>

<p>Note that the date in the video was meant to say <i><b>""September""</b></i> for our launch. We are also talking about a space courier operation - not manned flight.</p>
<p>Note that the video shows our starting model. The X-1. We started with a chunky, small winged craft and allowed the maths and science to create the ever so sleek X-2A. The ""A"" is because we did a few tweaks after publishing the design of the X-2 version. <br/></p>
<h3>Desktop Testing</h3>The world understands flight dynamics better than ever and the world creates aircraft using desktop testing. So do we. Want to see a small video of one test. It scans the vehicle as a single moment in time and shows the pressure waves. In fact it was this video that caused us to ""tweak"" the X-2 design. We noticed some pressure waves bouncing off the winglets.<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FSNTxo2UAu6M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSNTxo2UAu6M&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FSNTxo2UAu6M%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>We also tapered the rear end of the craft to lower Base Drag. More on that in our updates.<br/>
<p></p>
<h3>Do We Have What it Takes?</h3>
<p>The answer is <i><b>YES</b></i> for many more reasons than the few below, but these points address the biggest hurdles:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned earlier we have an enviable track record in balloon flights to the stratosphere and experience in building aircraft and flying them remotely. <br/>
</li>
<li>Robert Brand has been a glider pilot and worked in support of many space programs. <br/>
</li>
<li>Robert also has the a huge communications background, including communications with spacecraft.</li>
<li>Robert and Jason both have Amateur Radio certificates and Robert works with Extreme Radio systems in challenging environments.</li>
<li>Our Sponsors and Supporters think that we have the ""Right Stuff"": Australia's <b>Defense Scientific and Research Organisation</b> and the enormous support of <b>Hobbyking</b> are two of the reasons that make this a reality. <br/>
</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>
<div> <p> The risk is simple. If we fail on our first attempt. We have factored that into the budget and will simply correct the problem and fly again. The 3.5m / 11.5ft craft will be also tested as a small model with a ducted fan for propulsion. It will be flown to 120m / 400ft and allowed to glide for testing. It will then be flown back for more tests.<br/></p> <ul> <li>We have designed the craft using desk top modelling and our own spreadsheets, developed for this unusual flight. The refinements show us the lowest drag and pressure differentials making for a great design that simply feels right!</li>
<li>We have eliminated the chance of it pulling out of the dive by removing the lift form the wings and making the craft symmetrical in any cross-section nose to tail.<br/>
</li> <li>We have a great support team and we are collecting a huge amount of data from sensors on the craft. That will be sent to the ground in real time and recorded and also recorded on board in our own ""Black Box"". The system will allow us to refine the design and overcome any problems<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We would ask that you contribute anything from $1 to whatever you can afford to create a huge opportunity for new competition in the space sector; a 13 year old to create a ""sonic boom""; and to make world records tumble, opening new doors for student and youth that believe that they can make a difference. If you can't space a dollar, please do one or both of the following<br/></p> <ul> <li>Get the word out and make some noise about Project ThunderStruck.</li> <li>Remember that you can use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

Note that the date in the video was meant to say ""September"" for our launch. We are also talking about a space courier operation - not manned flight.
Note that the video shows our starting model. The X-1. We started with a chunky, small winged craft and allowed the maths and science to create the ever so sleek X-2A. The ""A"" is because we did a few tweaks after publishing the design of the X-2 version. 
Desktop TestingThe world understands flight dynamics better than ever and the world creates aircraft using desktop testing. So do we. Want to see a small video of one test. It scans the vehicle as a single moment in time and shows the pressure waves. In fact it was this video that caused us to ""tweak"" the X-2 design. We noticed some pressure waves bouncing off the winglets.We also tapered the rear end of the craft to lower Base Drag. More on that in our updates.

Do We Have What it Takes?
The answer is YES for many more reasons than the few below, but these points address the biggest hurdles:


As mentioned earlier we have an enviable track record in balloon flights to the stratosphere and experience in building aircraft and flying them remotely. 

Robert Brand has been a glider pilot and worked in support of many space programs. 

Robert also has the a huge communications background, including communications with spacecraft.
Robert and Jason both have Amateur Radio certificates and Robert works with Extreme Radio systems in challenging environments.
Our Sponsors and Supporters think that we have the ""Right Stuff"": Australia's Defense Scientific and Research Organisation and the enormous support of Hobbyking are two of the reasons that make this a reality. 





Risks & Challenges 
  The risk is simple. If we fail on our first attempt. We have factored that into the budget and will simply correct the problem and fly again. The 3.5m / 11.5ft craft will be also tested as a small model with a ducted fan for propulsion. It will be flown to 120m / 400ft and allowed to glide for testing. It will then be flown back for more tests.  We have designed the craft using desk top modelling and our own spreadsheets, developed for this unusual flight. The refinements show us the lowest drag and pressure differentials making for a great design that simply feels right!
We have eliminated the chance of it pulling out of the dive by removing the lift form the wings and making the craft symmetrical in any cross-section nose to tail.
 We have a great support team and we are collecting a huge amount of data from sensors on the craft. That will be sent to the ground in real time and recorded and also recorded on board in our own ""Black Box"". The system will allow us to refine the design and overcome any problems
    Other Ways You Can Help We would ask that you contribute anything from $1 to whatever you can afford to create a huge opportunity for new competition in the space sector; a 13 year old to create a ""sonic boom""; and to make world records tumble, opening new doors for student and youth that believe that they can make a difference. If you can't space a dollar, please do one or both of the following  Get the word out and make some noise about Project ThunderStruck. Remember that you can use the Indiegogo share tools!

Thanks for taking the first part of the journey to space with us. Please consider supporting us as this is a wild ride driven by imagination, innovation and the right people.",4.0,1,"1 Campaign

more than 50 approach and production technology, we believed we have found the
One. The next phase was testing. After several focus group researches, we
finalized the recipe, what managed to preserve the natural taste and scent of
lavender. When you pop up a bottle, you can feel the
scent of a fresh lavender straightaway, and no matter if you are making a
beverage or food, you can always taste the unique flavor.
Since
we didn’t have our own production line, we needed to find a factory, where we
could produce the first line of products. After a long searching period, we
managed to find a factory, which met all of our criteria, so we struck a deal
with them.In
the meantime we designed the image of the brand, and engineered the package
of our products. The production process was successful, and more than a 100
consumers have already tested the product since then. So far, we have only received
positive comments.We
truly believe that we created an appealing product, so we started
our Indiegogo campaign with several goals. We would like more people to meet our product, and recognize the potential inside Lavender Syrup. In order to
accomplish that, we need to set up a global distribution line. Besides of our own
sales force, we need to find new distributors and retailers. We also need to
find partners for logistics, so we could properly transport and store our
products in order to serve every distributor and retailer.When you are going global, the first thing you need to do is to start mass production. At first we plan to
hire a production line temporarily, and in the second phase, we intend to
start our own factory.We
are also planning on improving the product by making it more perfect,
and also focusing on finding new ways utilize our lavender plants. At last but not least, our goal is to increase the number of the plants, so we would be able to meet the growing
demand for Lavender Syrup.
Thank your
for your time, we hope you like our Lavender Syrup. Taste it, find your own way
to use it, and share it with our community! See you around!",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I started this tailoring business to supplement my family's income, just to cope with our daily basic expenses in this increasingly expensive society. I started off with bespoke/custom tailoring and naturally progressed to include pattern and sample making, and small-lot production services for fashion labels and designers.</p>
<p>To my utter surprise, business has been good to the extent that I now need to hire help. Staffing also means moving the business out of my house and into a more suitable location. </p>
<p>This is presenting itself as a chance to pay-it-forward for the many opportunities and blessings I've received. And since I'm in the business of dressing women, I'd like pay it to other women who truly need it. </p>
<p>This workshop, which will be set up in Kuala Lumpur, hopes to give women in need a stepping stone towards changing their circumstances. It will also offer an opportunity to those who are disabled, but still have adequate motor ability, to learn a tangible skill and be equitably employed and empowered through their employment.<br/></p>

</h3> <p>Being a solo act at the moment, funds are rather limited to what I can afford for rent and salary...and that doesn't amount to enough unfortunately.</p>
<p>So with your help, I hope to raise the requisite amount which will:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>pay for the securities deposit for the new place</li>
<li>sustain rent and utility expenses for 4-5 months</li>
<li>buy the minimum no. of new machines for training and operations</li>
<li>pay a fair wage to the ladies during the first months of apprenticeship.</li>
</ul>
<div>Even if the target isn't reached but minimally sufficient, every little bit of contribution will still be put towards setting up the new workshop, and perhaps buying fewer machines than planned, but enough to go ahead with training and continued operations. </div>
<div>And you won't leave empty-handed either! Choose any amount you are comfortable with to give and receive a gift in return. You could enjoy discounts on custom orders, or receive a complimentary dress from our small RTW collection. Or, if you are an avid seamstress yourself, get a free dress pattern from our modest range of commercial paper/pdf patterns.</div>

This is presenting itself as a chance to pay-it-forward for the many opportunities and blessings I've received. And since I'm in the business of dressing women, I'd like pay it to other women who truly need it. 
This workshop, which will be set up in Kuala Lumpur, hopes to give women in need a stepping stone towards changing their circumstances. It will also offer an opportunity to those who are disabled, but still have adequate motor ability, to learn a tangible skill and be equitably employed and empowered through their employment.


   

The Impact



The workshop will offer free pattern making and/or sewing lessons to 2 ladies each month. These ladies will be sought from local orphanages, welfare homes and other community help organizations, etc. Upon acquisition of adequate skills, they can choose to progress onto the next curriculum (still free) or become part of my production team as a paid apprentice. They can also choose to start earning a living with their own home-based sewing business, or be placed with other social entrepreneurial businesses that would require sewing apprentices.


In order to maintain operational costs, the workshop will also be opened to the paying public; ladies (and gents) who also want to learn to sew as a hobby.
This will help keep alive a vanishing skill in a metropolis society. A skill that enabled our own grandmothers and great-grandmothers to supplement their household incomes and send their daughters to school.

And, let's be honest, I get to keep doing a job I love and give something back at the same time. 







What We Need & What You Get
 Being a solo act at the moment, funds are rather limited to what I can afford for rent and salary...and that doesn't amount to enough unfortunately.
So with your help, I hope to raise the requisite amount which will:


pay for the securities deposit for the new place
sustain rent and utility expenses for 4-5 months
buy the minimum no. of new machines for training and operations
pay a fair wage to the ladies during the first months of apprenticeship.

Even if the target isn't reached but minimally sufficient, every little bit of contribution will still be put towards setting up the new workshop, and perhaps buying fewer machines than planned, but enough to go ahead with training and continued operations. 
And you won't leave empty-handed either! Choose any amount you are comfortable with to give and receive a gift in return. You could enjoy discounts on custom orders, or receive a complimentary dress from our small RTW collection. Or, if you are an avid seamstress yourself, get a free dress pattern from our modest range of commercial paper/pdf patterns.




Other Ways You Can Help
 Money isn't everything (but it sure helps), so if you'd like to contribute in other ways, I will be thrilled! This is a list of some of the things that would be gleefully welcomed and greatly appreciated:


New or used industrial sewing and cutting equipment in good working order. 
New or used domestic sewing machines in good working order.
Affordable/free space (large enough to accommodate a small sewing manufactory).
CAD pattern drafting software. 
New or used sewing tables, stools and other furniture.

Or you can simply help me get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. Do feel free to use the Indiegogo share tools.  THANK YOU most sincerely from me at F+D!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Unique Perks!</h3>
<p>A case of Hunter Bars will retail for around $38 but our backers have the chance to get as much as 25% off!  Also, some of our perks are bundle packages.  What this means is that we've partnered with some pretty cool companies who have agreed to offer their product/service at a generous discount when bundled with our discounted bars!  Some are offed with a limited supply so take advantage while they are available!</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>We have worked for almost a year developing Hunter Bars.  Assembling the right team and finding the right manufacturer is a lot tougher than we expected but our persistence paid off.  Even though it feels like we've been at this a LONG TIME, it's not even one year yet.  We share that to say that by backing Hunter Bars you are doing so with the understanding that this is a new product.   </p>
<p>So to manage expectations, here are some things that are important to know:</p>
<p><b>MANUFACTURING:</b> We are working closely with a manufacturer who has been able to produce Hunter Bars at a high quality so we have already resolved some of the manufacturing challenges. However, to produce on a larger scale will require increased production supplies and ingredients - this is where some delay could occur.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>FULFILLMENT</b></span><b>: </b>Despite the best planning, there may be factors that we cannot control such as equipment malfunction, transport, or supplier delays. While we hope that your support on Indiegogo will enable us to begin production on a commercial scale we have no idea as to whether it will be 'business as usual' for us or an overwhelming demand. If more people than we anticipate want Hunter Bars we may have to scale up the factory or set up manufacturing in additional locations.  We will endeavor to produce the product quickly and make sure that the early backers are given priority to receive their Hunter Bars.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><b>Our goal is to have you as a customer for life, so your feedback and satisfaction are very important to us.  We've created a list of common questions and answers that should cover all the bases. </b></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: Are Hunter Bars allergen free?</b><br/></p>
<p>The short answer is no. While we may not include common allergens in the bars (for example, peanuts), the bars are manufactured in a shared facility and may contain traces of Milk, Eggs, Soy, Wheat, Tree Nuts, and Peanuts.</p>
<p><b>Q: Are Hunter Bars gluten free?</b></p>
<p>While the bars are not certified gluten-free because of possible cross-contamination in the facility, we aren't adding any wheat ingredients.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Q: I'm on a strict Paleo diet, can I eat a Hunter Bar?</b></span></p>

<p>30 out of 31 people we sent samples to loved this flavor.  That's a 96.7% approval rating, a stat other bars will be jealous of!  If you click on the gallery tab at the top of the campaign, you will be able to view some of the video testimonials we've received.  In addition, you can review our Twitter and Facebook account to read even more testimonials.  So yeah, they taste good!</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the maximum amount of Hunter Bars an individual should consume in a day?</b></p>
<p>The recommended usage for Hunter Bars is 2-3 bars per day. Although there is nothing harmful about consuming more bars than this in a short period of time, it should be noted that Hunter Bars are not designed to be a nutritionally complete food. Rather, they are intended to be a nutritious snack food to accompany your diet. Hunter Bars should be consumed as part of a well-balanced diet containing a wide variety of healthy foods.</p>

<p>Hunter Bars were not specifically designed for persons with diabetes.  Your physician or registered dietitian should be consulted regarding the proper consumption of Hunter Bars if you have diabetes.</p>

<p></p>
<div>
<b>Q: Can children eat Hunter Bars?</b><p></p>
<p>Hunter Bars were developed based on adult nutritional needs. These products are not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age.  If you plan to use these products for children less than 4 years of age, please check with the child's health care professional first.</p>

<p><b>Q: What nuts are processed in the facilities that produce Hunter Bars?</b></p>
<p>At this point, all Hunter Bars are manufactured in a facility that processes nuts (peanuts and/or tree nuts). Therefore bars without nuts are made on the same lines as other bars containing nuts.

Introducing Hunter Bars - 

Food designed to Target Your Hunger ™



Have you ever stopped to think about all of the improvements made in hunting and fishing over the years?





We're pretty sure that you aren't using the same bow, gun, or fishing equipment that your grandparents used.  Yet would you believe most of us still pack the same food they did?  Yep, its true.  Most hunters and anglers we know still pack the same stand-by food items when they head out, food affectionately called ""Old School Hunting Food.""   Check out the list...look familiar? 



Here's the problem:  Old school hunting food doesn't cut it.  Why?  Because hunting burns the same amount of calories as swimming and jogging. (www.calorielab.com/burned) 


Yet people swim or jog for an hour or two at a time.  Hunters and anglers are out a lot longer so we burn calories at a very high rate.  Here's what we mean:
We're not going to travel for 3 or 4 hours just to hunt or fish for an hour.  We're out all day! From our personal experience and according to everyone we've been talking with, it's not uncommon for hunters and anglers to be out for 4-6 hours at a time!  That's some serious calorie burning.  It takes its toll physically and mentally.

Here's the solution!


Hunter Bars™ are the first nutritional energy bars made specifically for the hunter and angler.  These bars increase mental alertness, are packed with protein, and give you energy without the jitters.  
Hunter Bars™ come in a quiet, water-tight wrapper and can travel with you without melting or getting soggy.  We want you to experience the adrenaline rush of the kill and be able to tell stories around the campfire, not go back empty-handed because you got too tired or too hungry.
These bars provide nutrients that increase your stamina and energy so you can stay in the hunt longer.  





Finally, food as advanced as your gear!

It's a nutritional bar combined with an energy bar.


                                    





Is there an ingredient list?  

Great question. We are starting with our most popular flavor called Autumn Spice.  It's a great blend of pumpkin and ginger.  While the bars are not certified gluten-free, we aren't adding any wheat ingredients and we are leaving out milk products (this includes whey protein).  Most of the population can't digest these well, and some people have major issues with them.  
There are still a few things we are working out with our food scientist so we do not have a final nutritional label.  
We can tell you that they are made to specifically address the nutritional needs of hunters and anglers.  Our food scientist (who comes from a family of hunters and herself is a hunter for 20+ years) is helping us deliver a bar that contains ingredients known to increase energy, stamina, concentration, and alertness.  
Here are some general facts about Hunter Bars:



52-58 grams


Approximately 230-260 calories per bar


Approximately 10-16 grams of protein per bar

The final iteration of our ginger bar will likely contain almonds, coconut, sunflower seeds, sunflower oil, almond butter, ginger, organic flax seed, organic flax seed oil, pumpkin spice, vanilla, organic oats, organic brown rice syrup, and organic brown crispy rice.
12 bars per case




There's Science Behind These Bars


Yes, it's true!  Hunter Bars has our very own Food Scientist and Nutritionist, Dr. Jana Bogs, who is making sure these bars not only taste good, but do exactly what they are suppose to do.




So how do they taste? 


Another great question.  Of course we think they taste great, but let's take a look at what these fellow hunters & anglers have to say when they tried the samples we sent them:






The great thing about Hunter Bars™ is how the idea makes so much sense.   Its a nutritional bar combined with an energy bar made to meet the demanding needs of hunters and anglers.  



Stay in the Hunt™ and Target Your Hunger™ with Hunter Bars.

How we arrived at our target number of $50,000
There are so many variables that go into setting a price point when it comes to manufacturing a great product.   After much thought, we decided to focus on quality ingredients and high volume.  That does two things:  1) allows the Hunter Bar to deliver what it is supposed to every single time and, 2) be sold at a great value.  

Our Unique Perks!
A case of Hunter Bars will retail for around $38 but our backers have the chance to get as much as 25% off!  Also, some of our perks are bundle packages.  What this means is that we've partnered with some pretty cool companies who have agreed to offer their product/service at a generous discount when bundled with our discounted bars!  Some are offed with a limited supply so take advantage while they are available!

POSSIBLE  RISKS & CHALLENGES - THINGS TO BEAR IN MIND


We have worked for almost a year developing Hunter Bars.  Assembling the right team and finding the right manufacturer is a lot tougher than we expected but our persistence paid off.  Even though it feels like we've been at this a LONG TIME, it's not even one year yet.  We share that to say that by backing Hunter Bars you are doing so with the understanding that this is a new product.   
So to manage expectations, here are some things that are important to know:
MANUFACTURING: We are working closely with a manufacturer who has been able to produce Hunter Bars at a high quality so we have already resolved some of the manufacturing challenges. However, to produce on a larger scale will require increased production supplies and ingredients - this is where some delay could occur.
FULFILLMENT: Despite the best planning, there may be factors that we cannot control such as equipment malfunction, transport, or supplier delays. While we hope that your support on Indiegogo will enable us to begin production on a commercial scale we have no idea as to whether it will be 'business as usual' for us or an overwhelming demand. If more people than we anticipate want Hunter Bars we may have to scale up the factory or set up manufacturing in additional locations.  We will endeavor to produce the product quickly and make sure that the early backers are given priority to receive their Hunter Bars.

Common Questions & Answers


Our goal is to have you as a customer for life, so your feedback and satisfaction are very important to us.  We've created a list of common questions and answers that should cover all the bases. 
Q: Are Hunter Bars allergen free?
The short answer is no. While we may not include common allergens in the bars (for example, peanuts), the bars are manufactured in a shared facility and may contain traces of Milk, Eggs, Soy, Wheat, Tree Nuts, and Peanuts.
Q: Are Hunter Bars gluten free?
While the bars are not certified gluten-free because of possible cross-contamination in the facility, we aren't adding any wheat ingredients.
Q: I'm on a strict Paleo diet, can I eat a Hunter Bar?
Our understanding is that a strict Paleo diet does not do grains like oats.  If we elect to have oats in Hunter Bars, the oats will be certified gluten free, which means they will not be cross contaminated with wheat because of using the same fields.  That being said, if you are a strict Paleo, you might want to buy Hunter Bars for a non-Paleo friend for the time being.  :-)
Q:  Do they taste good?
30 out of 31 people we sent samples to loved this flavor.  That's a 96.7% approval rating, a stat other bars will be jealous of!  If you click on the gallery tab at the top of the campaign, you will be able to view some of the video testimonials we've received.  In addition, you can review our Twitter and Facebook account to read even more testimonials.  So yeah, they taste good!

Q: If only part of a Hunter Bar is eaten, what is the best way to store the remaining piece of the bar?


They are so good that it's rare to not finish one!  We suggest that you share it with your buddy.  If that won't work, cut off the portion you wish to consume and then store the unused portion in a sealed storage bag at room temperature.
Q: What nuts are processed in the facilities that produce Hunter Bars?
At this point, all Hunter Bars are manufactured in a facility that processes nuts (peanuts and/or tree nuts). Therefore bars without nuts are made on the same lines as other bars containing nuts.

Q: Does Hunter Bars contribute to a social cause?

Yes!  As a matter of fact, after our launch, we will donate a portion of our net profits to two awesome causes...Disabled American Veterans and Feeding America.

<div>In last decade many historical castles deteriorated to absolute ruins, mostly because of greed of some people who got them cheap from local governments and then got lucrative loans for restoration which never happen and  these lovely castles decayed close to complete destruction. You can see the current state in our gallery.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We have decided to save one and bring it back to life. Our plan starts with complete restoration of the building and conversion of it to community center that will stand out even in 21st century.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We plan to use  restored castle to preserve traditional crafts such as weaving, paper making, candle making etc. We are selecting crafts that can be performed by socially excluded. Our aim is to create protected environment for disabled or otherwise excluded, so we can help them to ingrate and get employment.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Third main cornerstone of our project is to use part of the property as business incubator that will provide friendly and effective environment for startups to prove that not all businesses are destructive for cultural heritage.</div>
<div><br/></div> <p></p>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<div>Whole project is brainchild of Petr who in real life is DataCenter architect and business owner. Petr has created this project as the way to return something to his country of origin and society there. In the past Petr was part of similar project in early 2000's where they have created protected workshops for disabled people with severe disabilities (<a href=""http://www.letohradekvendula.cz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.letohradekvendula.cz</a>). </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Petr's drive and enthusiasm spread across his contacts so the team for this project has grown to include people form full spectrum of life. Many of whom is joining team directly and putting their own efforts and support to this cause.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Each and every penny that we raise will go to restoration of this lovely piece of architecture. Together with our own funds we are also working with Culture ministry of Czech Republic, European structural fonds and donations from our supporters on preserving the heritage of the castle.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We will start by securing the main building, preventing more structural damage, installing new roof, restoring fallen walls. Which we believe is most critical part for this round we would love to have roof ready by winter to prevent one more year of snow and wet getting in to the walls.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Estimates for completing the whole project are in range of 50m czech crowns (about 2.000.000 USD). Here we are asking you to support us with the crucial task of starting the process of saving the castle.  As said before we are working together with government organizations to get grants to help us to save the castle, but these take time and we are looking to you to help us to bridge the gap and make this happen.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Even if we </span>don't<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> reach the goal all the money raised here will go towards the restoration and will support our own </span>efforts<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and efforts of our </span>supporters to  raise the rest of the capital need for our project.</div>

</div></div>","Why and What we want
In last decade many historical castles deteriorated to absolute ruins, mostly because of greed of some people who got them cheap from local governments and then got lucrative loans for restoration which never happen and  these lovely castles decayed close to complete destruction. You can see the current state in our gallery.

We have decided to save one and bring it back to life. Our plan starts with complete restoration of the building and conversion of it to community center that will stand out even in 21st century.

We plan to use  restored castle to preserve traditional crafts such as weaving, paper making, candle making etc. We are selecting crafts that can be performed by socially excluded. Our aim is to create protected environment for disabled or otherwise excluded, so we can help them to ingrate and get employment.

Third main cornerstone of our project is to use part of the property as business incubator that will provide friendly and effective environment for startups to prove that not all businesses are destructive for cultural heritage.
 
Who we are
Whole project is brainchild of Petr who in real life is DataCenter architect and business owner. Petr has created this project as the way to return something to his country of origin and society there. In the past Petr was part of similar project in early 2000's where they have created protected workshops for disabled people with severe disabilities (www.letohradekvendula.cz). 

Petr's drive and enthusiasm spread across his contacts so the team for this project has grown to include people form full spectrum of life. Many of whom is joining team directly and putting their own efforts and support to this cause.
   What We Need & What You Get
Each and every penny that we raise will go to restoration of this lovely piece of architecture. Together with our own funds we are also working with Culture ministry of Czech Republic, European structural fonds and donations from our supporters on preserving the heritage of the castle.

We will start by securing the main building, preventing more structural damage, installing new roof, restoring fallen walls. Which we believe is most critical part for this round we would love to have roof ready by winter to prevent one more year of snow and wet getting in to the walls.

Estimates for completing the whole project are in range of 50m czech crowns (about 2.000.000 USD). Here we are asking you to support us with the crucial task of starting the process of saving the castle.  As said before we are working together with government organizations to get grants to help us to save the castle, but these take time and we are looking to you to help us to bridge the gap and make this happen.


Even if we don't reach the goal all the money raised here will go towards the restoration and will support our own efforts and efforts of our supporters to  raise the rest of the capital need for our project.

    The Impact
Impact is immense, this campaign can save castle that stands on its place since 1437 when it was first mentioned as fortress. It was rebuilt in 1620 by order of  Christopher Hrobčiký of Hrobčice as renaissance chateau. Because of the owner  participated in upraising in the same year chateau was attacked, burned and confiscated and became part of kings estate.

In 1623 castle was bought by František Clary de Riva. His descendants rebuilt abandoned castle in the Baroque style and founded large park  in the second half of the 17th century.  Count Leopold Kaspar Clary-Aldringen the side branch Clary de Riva, inherited  the castle in 1746. His descendants kept the castle till y. 1804 when it was bought by Jan Antonín Chládek and immediately sold in 1809 to Edward of Schönburka. Castle was in family possession  up to the year 1945.


After Second World War castle was used by Czech army as storage depot and after velvet revolution in 1989 was as part of privatization sold to private company in 1992 that left the castle to ruin after it cashed out the loans for its restoration.

So appart form saving the piece of history our project has two more areas of impact as described in our 3 corner stone activities.

First one is to restore the property destroyed by greed

Second is to create and preserve center with national handicraft 

Third one is to create friendly environment for startups to grow companies that will be responsible to its history and environment.

Doing all these we want to create jobs for socially excluded in Czech society, be it in manufactures of Czech handicraft or in support roles for the startup incubator or incubator itself as we believe in equal opportunities for all.


 Risks & Challenges
As it might become obvious in this project biggest risk is that we will not be fast enough and the castle collapse to the ruins before we can save it. To prevent that we are already in discussion with the Ministry of culture and their National Landmark persecution fund to fund emergency repairs together with our own funds.
Also as this Castle is part of the bankruptcy proceeding against the greedy company we are negotiating its direct purchase with legal receiver and there are some legal hurdles that we are facing, luckily we have solicitors and legal advisers in our team and we are making progress.

<div>          Hello,  my name is Gabriel and I am going into my Junior year of High School. Over two years ago  I was looking at a variety of community service projects in South America. As I was doing research, I came across Mishky Huarmy, a company that partners up with Indigenous Women. I felt attracted to the project because they work with a lot of single women.

The goals of the company are to bring a secure and reliable economic situation to Indigenous Ecuadorian women, and to help the indigenous people to be proud of their identity and heritage.  Many of the ancestral traditions of Ecuadorian women are frowned upon because along with the Spanish conquest came the Spaniards' way of life, and traditional cultures were discouraged. Now with the help of Mishky Huarmy there is a resurgence of pride in the Cayambe region when it comes to indigenous culture and identity. </span>

Making granola to hire refugees.

About seven years ago we decided we'd try to do something, even it if was tiny. So we started a granola company.  
We knew that the few refugees resettling in our state (about 150-250 per year) were having a terrible time finding their first jobs.  So we decided that every employee in our company would be a refugee and every

could be replicated in other refugee communities across the US and beyond.



Our nutty new campaign.



Just two years ago, with the help of 135 partners in our first Indiegogo campaign we launched a new product (granola bars) and grew our business.
We now feel ready to grow again.  In fact, within the next year we've set our sights on helping 20
refugees move into the job market. 
So what better way to make our nuttiness official than to officially go into nuts? Spiced nuts, that is. We’ve been working on prototypes. Thinly glazed with honey and a flavor that will knock your socks off. There's nothing on the market quite like them.

Third, you can be part of perfecting the product.  Big corporations have their focus groups.  We think we can do better by gathering a team Product Developers to sample our prototypes and advise us on perfecting them. You get to be the first to taste, and the last to have a say in the final version. Help us get ready to put them on the shelves!

    Other ways to help.
We know that not everyone can contribute monetarily to our cause. HOWEVER, there are more ways than one to go nuts in supporting our job training project for refugees. 
Find out what's happening in refugee resettlement in your city.  It's easier than you might imagine to visit and get to know a refugee family.  If you live in RI, you can always volunteer with us.  We can often use the extra hands! Contact us at info@beautifuldayri.com.
A campaign like this lives or dies on the basis of its reach--primarily through social media.   Share the campaign through Facebook, Twitter, email, and good ol' fashioned word of mouth. Spread the word to your family and friends that don't know about us.Visit our website site and blog and learn more about our mission at: www.beautifuldayri.org

And be sure to follow our progress over the next six weeks. We sincerely thank you for your support!

story of my idea</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>I
was born into a poor, rural family and I remember my childhood: I was
hungry and cold. 
</p>
<p>There
was no heating or electricity at home, and we had nothing to eat
either. 
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When
I was hungry and cold I could only dream about a plate of warm food.
Not only me, but my whole family was dreaming too. And we often
chatted about food and we were planning on what we would eat when we
would have something... 
</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">But
I grew up and I grew into a determined adult who has always been
sympathetic with the less fortunate. Reaching adulthood I joined
building groups and became their cook on assignments in Europe. I was
given a shy budget and told to cook something delicious and filling
for a group of grown up hungry men. And I did it for years! 
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I
grew into the job, learnt tricks and techniques and I've always thrived to provide nutritious, delicious and, of course, plenty of food for
them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It
was great to see how much they appreciated my meals. They were
grateful that someone has provided them with dinner after a long
day's work. During the years I received positive feedback and
encouragement to carry on with cooking. So I landed in London and
carried on with my work in various kitchens. It didn't take a long
time to get horrified – the amount of food going into waste is just
unspeakable. I've seen still in date and good food being thrown out
routinely only because there was too much. 
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After
several countries in Europe there has been something unchanged here,
in London. Then and even now, every day I see homeless people on the
streets...and people try to look away. Is it because of disdain?
Ignorance? Disgust? Or simply because they don't want to see, notice
or care with others' suffering? I do not know, I cannot see others'
thoughts or souls. But I cannot and will not walk away from or ignore
them. They are there, weather or not we like it. They are humans,
just like you and me. The difference is they have less fortune
than others.</p>

The
origin of the name

Our
principle is based on good deeds and we are going to have several
ways how us and our customers can show it:



We will not throw out good food! Whatever is left after each day is just an extra plate for someone. These extras will be donated to the homeless, local shelters or families who are
in need – and it only takes a little to produce enough to surely
have some extra dishes. We won't use the same food the following day,

whatever amount of donations. These will go towards producing more on
the following day so we will have more extra to give away.

When we start to select our staff we will advertise our positions at homeless shelters. So we are going to give them a chance to start working with us and hopefully, start a new life.
We have other ideas and in time we will introduce those too.



What
will be the money used for:

NO LOS DEJEMOS RENDIRSE!
NO PERMITAMOS QUE LA ABANDONEN! 
AYUDANOS A CUIDARLOS & DEJANOS AYUDARTE A ENTREGARLES TU AYUDA!
Nariz Roja (www.narizroja.org) es una institución no lucrativa fundada por Alejandro Barbosa (Facebook: Alejandro Barbosa Padilla) hace 5 años, quien ha sido -según las propias palabras de los niños y sus familiares- un verdadero angel en sus vidas. 
Esta maravillosa organización brinda albergue, alimentos, servicios de lavandería y regaderas a los niños y sus familiares... y este año, con la ayuda de todos podrán además disfrutar de su nueva escuela!!! 
Te invito a que pongas tu granito de arena -literalmente- en este gran proyecto, desde hacer voluntariado, donativos en especie o colaborar en esta campaña de recolección de fondos y les demos la oportunidad de tener no solo una buena educación, sino la alegría que el saber conlleva, la alegría de aprender, de convivir, de crecer!!!
Dentro de todo el sufrimiento que ellos pueden tener a causa de su enfermedad, ten por seguro que nos pueden dar infinidad de enseñanzas a su corta edad.. brindémosles un poco de alegría y ayudemos -desde donde estemos- a construir bellos recuerdos y bellos momentos, esperando que el día que estén completamente sanos, si es la voluntad de Dios, puedan reincorporarse por completo a sus escuelas en sus lugares de origen sin haber perdido ningún año escolar, sin haber dejado de estudiar. 
JUNTOS LO PODEMOS LOGRAR!!
$1 USD  es suficiente!
Si cada uno de los que le damos click a esta campaña donamos $1 USD estoy segura que lo conseguiremos!

¿Qué necesitamos? 


$10,000 USD para terminar la construcción de la escuela 
$15,000 USD para el equipamiento y funcionamiento de la escuela 

CONFIO EN USTEDES!! JUNTOS LO PODEMOS LOGRAR!!!
CUALQUIER DONATIVO HARÁ LA DIFERENCIA EN LA VIDA DE NUESTROS NIÑOS, SERA UN GRAN REGALO QUE PODRA CAMBIAR SUS VIDAS!

Qué más puedo hacer?



Si quires seguir apoyando a nuestros niños durante todo el año, puedes escoger cualquiera de estas actividades:

Convertirte en benefactor
Convertirte en donador de sangre (requisitos también en narizroja.org)
Hacer tus propias campañas monetarias, de alimentos, etc. en tu comunicad (iglesia, escuela, colonia, amigos, etc) entregarlo en Toluca 689. Guadalajara, Jalisco. C.P. 44360. 
Compartir la campaña con tus amigos y familiares (facebook, twitter, mail, etc.)

Algae are fascinating organisms and a substantial part of our ecosystem's balance. The functional foods and supplements we are developing with Uira BioenergEthic are relying on the power of microalgae, fed by wastewater and energy from sunlight.
There is an increasing global demand for high value functional foods and nutraceuticals like Omega 3 from plant sources. Currently, most of the supply for those products is depending on animal sources and their production is running on fossil fuels, exploiting and polluting the Earth’s resources at the same time.
To improve our diet and living healthy lives motivates us to take action and to found  Uira BioenergEthic.




Why we need your help


We chose to rely on a crowdfunding campaign because we want to keep our corporate structure consistent and organic. 
We believe that your support is necessary since the day one to provide healthier nutrition for everyone.





What you should know about Algae functional foods and supplements
Functional foods are a new concept in nutrition. 
By definition, functional foods and supplements have properties similar to medicines.
According to the scientific communities our nutrition has the most important role fr our hea


Omega 3 fatty acids


Humans developed on diets consisting of marine life, wild game and/or inland plants.
This type of diet provided sufficient Omega-3 fats, which resulted in an Omega-6/Omega-3 ratio that was around 1:1.
The current Western Countries diet provides a ratio that is around 16 to 20:1 (Omega-6:Omega-3). 
This is likely due to the shift in dietary staples, which generally do not include foods like flax, hemp, walnuts, perilla, green leafy veggies, chia, fish and algae.


The essential fats from algae may improve fatty acid balance and health benefits:

Cardiovascular function
Nervous system function
Immunity
Memory & concentration
Mood
Neurotransmission
Insulin sensitivity & nutrient partitioning
Body composition






Algae versus Fish Omega 3 fatty acids:

 “Because DHA is the active component for lowering triglycerides, for bioavailability to the brain and organs, and all Omega-3s can be made from DHA.
Algae oil is more concentrated in Omega-3s and in DHA and is thus better formulated for human metabolism.”
Dr. Scott Doughman - Biochemist and Algae Researcher

life. What differentiates us from others is the personal connection you as a
donor will have. You will actually see the amazing moment you are donating for!</p>
As children by
nature, have a strong urge to belong to something, to be part of a group, to be
connected with others. We give this opportunity. As being part of one of the
one million children. You actually feel connected. If you score number #213.234

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Eleni's Empanadas was establised while on maternity leave with our first son. It was a way for me to contribute to our growing family while exploring and developing my culinary skills. At first making empanadas was purely for the enjoyment at family gatherings; until one day my childhood friend offered to order my product for an event she was having for her own business. Now, three years and two boys later Eleni's Empanadas is an emerging catering business with customers from all over Southern Ontario. <a href=""https://elenisempanadas.wordpress.com/2014/09/08/food-festival-highlights/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aside from catering my empanadas to food lovers in the region I've had the opportunity to share my skills and knowledge of making these latino favourites for the great people of  Toronto in top tier food festivals as a Demo Chef. </a></p>
<p>This campaign is to help raise money with automating my empanada production and to pay for rent of a commercial kitchen; so that I can go from delivering individual orders to delivering my empanadas to the masses at leading Food Festival and in community pop-up locations in Toronto. Right now I press each empanada shell individually and each empanada is handcrafted. When I have help with the assembly for a large order it takes two full days; <b>that's only assembling 300 pieces</b>. With automating the production of the empanada shells I can press out thousands of shells in minutes which will cut down on my production time and be able to provide my present and future customers with empanadas at a quicker lead time.</p>
<p>My goal is to bring Eleni's Empanadas to as many people as possible this summer and eventually set up a shop where customers can come in an enjoy my food. Every time I'm working on an order my son says in excitement, <i>""Mommy we have a customer today!""</i> I want my sons to be proud of their Mommy and create an Empanada Empire that they may prosper from when they are ready to contribute to society.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need  </h3> <p>Currently, my production equipment consists of a food processor for making the dough, two cast iron empanada presses (different sizes) for pressing individual empanada shells and my hands for assembling. These all work well when I have manageable orders of 6 to 8 dozen. However, when I'm preparing a large order of 300+ pieces my food processor heats up too much with fear that it may have met its day. My body aches from pressing out so many pieces and then I have the challenge of storing and baking several sheets of my empanadas.</p>
<p>With the funding from Indiegogo, I will be able to purchase equipment necessary to automate my production and rent a commercial kitchen that has the capacity to store and bake my empanadas. The equipment I need to do that is an automatic empanada press, a commercial size food processor and mobile convection oven (for on site baking at Food Festivals). Also, I would need to rent out a commercial kitchen and hire someone full time to assist me with production. </p>
<p><b>Automatic Empanada Press = $8000</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Commericial Kitchen Rental for 2 months = $2880</b></span></p>
<p><b>Employee Cost for 2 months = $4800</b></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Eleni's Empanadas was establised while on maternity leave with our first son. It was a way for me to contribute to our growing family while exploring and developing my culinary skills. At first making empanadas was purely for the enjoyment at family gatherings; until one day my childhood friend offered to order my product for an event she was having for her own business. Now, three years and two boys later Eleni's Empanadas is an emerging catering business with customers from all over Southern Ontario. Aside from catering my empanadas to food lovers in the region I've had the opportunity to share my skills and knowledge of making these latino favourites for the great people of  Toronto in top tier food festivals as a Demo Chef. 
This campaign is to help raise money with automating my empanada production and to pay for rent of a commercial kitchen; so that I can go from delivering individual orders to delivering my empanadas to the masses at leading Food Festival and in community pop-up locations in Toronto. Right now I press each empanada shell individually and each empanada is handcrafted. When I have help with the assembly for a large order it takes two full days; that's only assembling 300 pieces. With automating the production of the empanada shells I can press out thousands of shells in minutes which will cut down on my production time and be able to provide my present and future customers with empanadas at a quicker lead time.
My goal is to bring Eleni's Empanadas to as many people as possible this summer and eventually set up a shop where customers can come in an enjoy my food. Every time I'm working on an order my son says in excitement, ""Mommy we have a customer today!"" I want my sons to be proud of their Mommy and create an Empanada Empire that they may prosper from when they are ready to contribute to society.   What We Need   Currently, my production equipment consists of a food processor for making the dough, two cast iron empanada presses (different sizes) for pressing individual empanada shells and my hands for assembling. These all work well when I have manageable orders of 6 to 8 dozen. However, when I'm preparing a large order of 300+ pieces my food processor heats up too much with fear that it may have met its day. My body aches from pressing out so many pieces and then I have the challenge of storing and baking several sheets of my empanadas.
With the funding from Indiegogo, I will be able to purchase equipment necessary to automate my production and rent a commercial kitchen that has the capacity to store and bake my empanadas. The equipment I need to do that is an automatic empanada press, a commercial size food processor and mobile convection oven (for on site baking at Food Festivals). Also, I would need to rent out a commercial kitchen and hire someone full time to assist me with production. 
Automatic Empanada Press = $8000
Commericial Kitchen Rental for 2 months = $2880
Employee Cost for 2 months = $4800
Catering Materials = $320

<p></p>
<p>My name is Octavio Rojas, leader of Qilotoa's project, and today I’m asking you to help me move my project forward and help make my dream come true.</p>
<p>That dream is Qilotoa.</p>
<p>Nearly
eight years ago, I explained the original vision for my project to someone who
I respect a great deal, and he told me: “This is something you don’t know how
to do. Dedicate yourself to what you do best”. I took his advice, and it proved
to be sound.  </p>
<p>I’m
grateful to this person, but more than two years ago, my journey through life
caused me to return to my original vision. I started to refine the idea and carry
out research. I built <b>a team</b>, found partners and spoke to people from all over
the world, from the Americas to Asia via Europe and Central America. I shared
my car and my house on Blablacar and Airbnb in order to <b>finance
my research trips.</b>  </p>
<p>It’s been a
long journey, and many people have supported me along the way, although there
have also been those who’ve told me I should accept that I’ll never make this
dream come true.  </p>
<p>But
finally, one day I realized that my vision was not only possible, but could
even go further. <b>It was a fantastic feeling. </b></p>
<p>To make my
project a reality, to make <b>my dream come true</b>, I’ll need help.  </p>
<p>I’m so
excited about this project, and I’m contacting you because I want to make my
professional vision a reality, to make my dream come true; a dream for which I’ve
mortgaged my house, invested my savings, dedicated more than two years of my
life and on which my personal and professional future depends.<br/></p>

<h3>Superando dificultades</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Soy Octavio Rojas, y hoy te pido que me ayudes a sacar adelante mi proyecto, hoy te pido que me ayudes a cumplir mi sueño.</p>
<p>Y mi sueño es Qilotoa.</p>
<p>Hace casi 8 años, le expuse la visión original de mi proyecto a una persona que respeto mucho, y él me dijo: “Eso es algo que no sabes hacer.  Dedícate a lo que sabes hacer bien”.   Le hice caso y me fue bien.  </p>
<p>Le estoy agradecido a esta persona, pero, hace más de 2 años, la vida me llevó a retomar mi visión original.  Comencé a madurarla y a investigar.  Formé un <b>equipo</b>, conseguí partners, hablé con gente de muchas partes del mundo, desde América hasta Asia, pasando por Europa y Centroamérica.  Compartí mi coche y mi casa a través de Blablacar y de Airbnb para<b> ahorrar y financiar mis viajes de investigación. </b></p>
<p>Ha sido un largo camino en el que muchas personas me han apoyado, pero también ha habido  quien me ha dicho que a lo mejor debo aceptar que no voy a conseguirlo. </p>
<p>Por fin un día me di cuenta de que mi visión es posible y que incluso podía ir más lejos.  Fue una <b>emoción </b>muy grande. </p>
<p>Aún tengo ilusión y este esfuerzo de dirigirme a ti nace de la ganas de hacer realidad una visión, un proyecto profesional, un sueño por el que he hipotecado mi casa, invertido mis ahorros, dedicado más 2 años de mi vida y en el que está en juego mi futuro personal y profesional. </p>
<p>Muchísimas gracias por tu apoyo.</p>

Introducing Qilotoa, the definitive solution for monitoring and analyzing
advertising, media and social networks in Latin America, via the integration of
the most advanced technologies available on the market.



After two years of research, Qilotoa was born as the definitive solution to meet all the needs of marketing, communication and public relations professionals by allowing them to find out what people are reading, listening to, watching and talking about.



Why
Qilotoa?

 Because it’s the solution to a problem we shared with thousands of
professionals in the fields of advertising, public relations and communication
around the world: how to find out what’s being said and broadcast about a
brand, product or reputation across all media and in real time. Qilotoa offers
a way to do this using a single platform that can be accessed via website,
tablet and smartphone.




What does Qilotoa do exactly?
Qilotoa will
allow them to know exactly what impact an investment in advertising and
communication achieves and its audience reach across all types of media. What’s
more, it will do so in a way that’s easy, modern and practically in real time.
Qilotoa offers
a single solution providing direct, limitless access to all of the editorial
mentions and advertising placements on TV, radio, in the press and online.  
Public
relations and advertising, united for the first time in a single tool!
Qilotoa enriches
this information with geolocated data regarding the impact on social networks.
This makes it the most complete and advanced tool on the market. 




Qilotoa also
offers the unique function of specific “pre-trending topics” when it detects
unusually high activity related to a specific subject.



Thanks to
the use of advanced “Speech to Text” technology, Qilotoa offers users the
opportunity to access mentions on TV and radio and even edit and distribute
them instantly, without intermediaries and practically in real time, 24/7. 



Qilotoa
monitors how many times a brand appears on TV by using a modern
recognition system for moving images.
Qilotoa analyses
all of the editorial mentions, advertising placements and social network
references, providing an integrated solution that will lower costs, lighten
workloads and reduce errors by centralizing all the information within a single
solution.
Qilotoa
offers “all-inclusive” services to prevent surprises when there is a large
volume of mentions in different types of media.

Qilotoa is a project developed by túatú social media & pr agency. It will be
offered in Ecuador initially, but its scalable nature means it can quickly be
offered to other countries in Latin America.

The methodology behind Qilotoa is the
brainchild of Octavio Isaac Rojas Orduña, the founder of túatú Spain and túatú
Ecuador and a public relations expert whose multicultural perspective has
benefited over 200 clients in five different countries over the course of his
20-plus years in the industry. 
 
Contributions

Up to 90% of 
the funds collected will go directly to the deployment of the solution.
Since it is a B2B solution, we are offering perks related to the media and Ecuador.  It will be fun to support us!  You can get more than just an object, but maybe a lifetime experience.
In case we don't reach the goal here, we will keep looking for the funds.  

We are doing Qilotoa, period!

With the funds, túatú social media & pr agency, which has offices in both Spain and Ecuador, will accelerate the deployment of Qilotoa in Ecuador and subsequently bring it to other markets in Latin America.PerksOvercoming challenges

   

My name is Octavio Rojas, leader of Qilotoa's project, and today I’m asking you to help me move my project forward and help make my dream come true.
That dream is Qilotoa.
Nearly
eight years ago, I explained the original vision for my project to someone who
I respect a great deal, and he told me: “This is something you don’t know how
to do. Dedicate yourself to what you do best”. I took his advice, and it proved
to be sound.  
I’m
grateful to this person, but more than two years ago, my journey through life
caused me to return to my original vision. I started to refine the idea and carry
out research. I built a team, found partners and spoke to people from all over
the world, from the Americas to Asia via Europe and Central America. I shared
my car and my house on Blablacar and Airbnb in order to finance
my research trips.  
It’s been a
long journey, and many people have supported me along the way, although there
have also been those who’ve told me I should accept that I’ll never make this
dream come true.  
But
finally, one day I realized that my vision was not only possible, but could
even go further. It was a fantastic feeling. 
To make my
project a reality, to make my dream come true, I’ll need help.  
I’m so
excited about this project, and I’m contacting you because I want to make my
professional vision a reality, to make my dream come true; a dream for which I’ve
mortgaged my house, invested my savings, dedicated more than two years of my
life and on which my personal and professional future depends.

Superando dificultades


Soy Octavio Rojas, y hoy te pido que me ayudes a sacar adelante mi proyecto, hoy te pido que me ayudes a cumplir mi sueño.
Y mi sueño es Qilotoa.
Hace casi 8 años, le expuse la visión original de mi proyecto a una persona que respeto mucho, y él me dijo: “Eso es algo que no sabes hacer.  Dedícate a lo que sabes hacer bien”.   Le hice caso y me fue bien.  
Le estoy agradecido a esta persona, pero, hace más de 2 años, la vida me llevó a retomar mi visión original.  Comencé a madurarla y a investigar.  Formé un equipo, conseguí partners, hablé con gente de muchas partes del mundo, desde América hasta Asia, pasando por Europa y Centroamérica.  Compartí mi coche y mi casa a través de Blablacar y de Airbnb para ahorrar y financiar mis viajes de investigación. 
Ha sido un largo camino en el que muchas personas me han apoyado, pero también ha habido  quien me ha dicho que a lo mejor debo aceptar que no voy a conseguirlo. 
Por fin un día me di cuenta de que mi visión es posible y que incluso podía ir más lejos.  Fue una emoción muy grande. 
Aún tengo ilusión y este esfuerzo de dirigirme a ti nace de la ganas de hacer realidad una visión, un proyecto profesional, un sueño por el que he hipotecado mi casa, invertido mis ahorros, dedicado más 2 años de mi vida y en el que está en juego mi futuro personal y profesional. 
Muchísimas gracias por tu apoyo.

Here is a sneak-peak of our masterplan - showing you how we envision Burunchuli! 


How will my contribution be applied?The funds raised in the campaign will be used in two ways:
 Buy appropriate materials.
 Employ local workers to start construction. 
Every single donation, no matter the size, makes an actual impact and will help rejuvenate Nepal and invigorate her children - one home, one family and one smile at a time.Making a donation might be easy and fast - but it truly is a meaningful gesture towards a country that has touched the hearts of so many - and where the struggle of loosing both home and livelihood has become a reality for millions. If chance happens that we exceed our financial goal we will immediately start actualizing our 6 other components. Our project takes a holistic approach to rehabilitation and every day we seek to strengthen:
Education and innovation.
Community empowerment - with emphasis on women's empowerment.
Eco-sustainability.
Can I come visit?Yes, indeed! In exchange for your generosity we are providing unique perks according to donation: volunteer and tourist opportunities along with home stays at Manegaun itself - meeting and befriending the families whose homes you helped build! 
These adventures will provide you with a sense of what we're doing - and you will be more than welcome to join the VFC and RCJM team for a longer or shorter period of time.

If you're already dreaming about (re)visiting this ancient Himalayan abode, why not take an opportunity to go beyond where most tourists go? To become an authentic part of a Nepali family?

<div>Are you prepared to protect your loved ones?  If not we are the people you need to visit.  Devildawg Firearms is not only ready to sell you a firearm but will teach you and your family how to use it correctly and safely.  <br/><br/>
</div>
<div>My name is Matthew Barges and I am ready to serve you just like I served my country.  I am a Marine, a husband, and father that is ready to help you and your family protect themselves and embrace the sport of shooting.  It would be an honor and a privilege to help you with your firearm needs.  </div>
<div><b>Top reasons why YOU want to support Devildawg Firearms:</b></div>
<div>1.  Devildawg firearms will NOT treat you like the ""big box"" retail stores.  We are there to educate and make you feel comfortable with your purchase. </div>
<div>2.  Devildawg firearms follows all the ATF guidelines on all purchases and sales.  </div>
<div>3.  Our range is a FULL service range.  We are ready to assist you with any of your shooting needs and comply with EPA and OSHA guidelines for our ventilation system.  The range will be a NRA certified range as well.</div>
<div>4.  Most of all, Devildawg firearms values all of their customers and their firearm needs as if they were family.</div>
<div>5.  Lifetime Perks are a HUGE reason to support Devildawg Firearms.  Once you support us we will consider you one of the family with the perks we are ready to offer you!</div>
<h3><br/></h3> </div> <div> <h3>Let's get to it:  What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div><b>What We NEED:</b></div>
<div>Unfortunately, the banks and the government still have FFL(Federal Firearm Retailers) under ""operation choke point"".  What this means is we have great difficulty receiving traditional funding for our small business and this is why we are reaching out to you.  Banks will not give an SBA(small business) loan to any business that has to deal with firearms.  NOT good for us!  My family consists of myself as a heavy equipment mechanic and my wife is an elementary school teacher.  So NO millions of dollars in the Barges' bank account ready to fund this important venture.  Time to get off my soap box!</div>
<div><b>Our TWO needs are simple:</b></div>
<div>1.  We need funding to finish building (in our own building) our 8 lane at 20 yard range in Villa Park, Illinois.  This range will be able to handle rifle, pistol, and tactical shooting.</div>
<div>2.  We need funding for firearm inventory to satisfy a variety of needs for all customers.</div>
<div><b>What You GET, the PERKS:</b></div>
<div>First off, no amount is too small.  We at Devildawg firearms appreciate any amount given and cannot thank you enough!</div>

<b>Who is ARI?<br/></b>Art
Relief International (ARI) was launched in 2009 and
uses art outreach, art education and art therapy techniques to break down
language and cultural barriers, This enables our workshop participants to
learn, grow and inevitably express their thoughts and feelings as individuals
and valuable community members via their creativity. Through encouragement our
students are better able to communicate their needs to the larger community and
bring about positive societal change, whilst empowering themselves and each
other. <br/><br/>We believe that art is a powerful tool for change. Our mission at ARI is
to promote expression and cultivate the creativity that lies inside each
individual. We use art to create an atmosphere of inclusion and belonging where
often there is none. ARI provides a VOICE for individuals by exploring various creative
means, including visual, performance and experimental arts.<br/><br/>
<p><b><i>""If a voice can't be heard, teach it to be
seen""- Emily Scott, Former Art Director</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Just some of the population groups that ARI facilitates art workshops with include children with physical and / or intellectual disabilities, orphans,
children of Burmese refugees and the hilltribes of Thailand who are not
afforded the same rights as Thai citizens, children and young people at risk of
being trafficked or already involved in the sex tourism trade and single
mothers (and their children), to name a few. ARI
delivers on average eight (but sometimes as many as twelve) workshops a week to
the communities mentioned above.</p>
<p><b>Our Annual Community Exhibition...</b><br/>
</p>
<p>Each year Art Relief International hosts a major exhibition
featuring the art work produced by our numerous community artists during our
workshops throughout the year. The exhibition is a celebration of the
creativity, ability and resilience of the communities we work with, as well as
a platform for sharing their various stories which often involve disadvantage,
marginalization and hardship. In essence, the exhibition provides a space where
their voices can be heard (or seen).</p>
<p>Past exhibitions have been extremely well attended by both locals
and expats alike, and help to promote our organization and the work we do with
our community artists and the partner organisations that support them. It also
highlights the need to continue to advocate for those most marginalized in our
society, and educate the wider community about the issues they face. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is also an opportunity to connect with our supporters around
the world, and hopefully recruit new supporters, via tools such as social media
(Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, our blog) where we will promote the exhibition
and share stories from all stages of the exhibition process, our websites where
we will host photos from the exhibition and our art catalogue which is
developed from the art work created and available to browse on-line - <a href=""http://issuu.com/artrelief/docs/ari_lookbook_2015_"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://issuu.com/artrelief/docs/ari_lookbook_2015_</a></p>
These opportunities to promote the work we do are vital for the
survival of our organisation. <br/><br/><b>Why We Need Your help...</b><br/>
<p>In November, 2015 we hope to increase the scope of the exhibition
and enhance the experience for our supporters in Chiang Mai. To achieve this,
we have decided to adopt the theme ‘Right of Passage’. A Rite of Passage can be
defined as ceremonies that mark important transitional periods in a person's
life, such as birth, becoming a legal adult, marriage and having children.
However, in adapting the spelling of ‘rite’ to ‘right’, we are interpreting the
meaning to be the freedom of access to any pathway in life, including the
various life markers mentioned above. </p>
<p>In addition to our new theme, we have also decided this year that
the exhibition will have a focus on installation art, further symbolising and
emphasising the concept of a ‘Rite of Passage’, where exhibition attendees will
be asked to ‘experience’ the art work, and therefore the stories and lives of
the artists themselves, as they wander through various ‘passages’ and pathways
that link the exhibition art work together.</p>
<p>In light of our ambitious ideas for this year’s exhibition, we are
seeking additional funding that will assist us in managing the increased costs
associated with this event, including venue hire, marketing (printing of
posters and flyers), art supplies and materials, construction, catering and
other miscellaneous costs which will arise as we begin the development of the
installation art works. <br/></p>
<p><b>What Will You Get In Return?</b><br/></p>
<p>In return for your pledge, not only will you receive that wonderful warm and fuzzy feeling you get when you assist those who will truly benefit from your help, there are also numerous rewards or 'perks' you will receive depending on the amount you pledge. You will also be able to see where all your generous money has gone via our many posts, updates, photos and blogs across our numerous social media platforms. <br/></p>However, we know not everybody is in a position to help financially, but would still love to support this wonderful cause. We would still be extremely grateful if you can simply spread the word about this campaign, the exhibition and the work we do at ARI. Please post, re-post, share, like, comment, blog etc. etc.<br/><br/>ARI would like to thank you in advance for your wonderful generosity. Together, we can use art to change the world, for the better.<br/><br/>In creativity, compassion and gratitude,<br/>The ARI Team.<br/>

children of Burmese refugees and the hilltribes of Thailand who are not
afforded the same rights as Thai citizens, children and young people at risk of
being trafficked or already involved in the sex tourism trade and single
mothers (and their children), to name a few. ARI
delivers on average eight (but sometimes as many as twelve) workshops a week to
the communities mentioned above.
Our Annual Community Exhibition...

Each year Art Relief International hosts a major exhibition
featuring the art work produced by our numerous community artists during our
workshops throughout the year. The exhibition is a celebration of the
creativity, ability and resilience of the communities we work with, as well as
a platform for sharing their various stories which often involve disadvantage,
marginalization and hardship. In essence, the exhibition provides a space where
their voices can be heard (or seen).
Past exhibitions have been extremely well attended by both locals
and expats alike, and help to promote our organization and the work we do with
our community artists and the partner organisations that support them. It also
highlights the need to continue to advocate for those most marginalized in our
society, and educate the wider community about the issues they face. 

It is also an opportunity to connect with our supporters around
the world, and hopefully recruit new supporters, via tools such as social media
(Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, our blog) where we will promote the exhibition
and share stories from all stages of the exhibition process, our websites where
we will host photos from the exhibition and our art catalogue which is
developed from the art work created and available to browse on-line - http://issuu.com/artrelief/docs/ari_lookbook_2015_
These opportunities to promote the work we do are vital for the
survival of our organisation. Why We Need Your help...
In November, 2015 we hope to increase the scope of the exhibition
and enhance the experience for our supporters in Chiang Mai. To achieve this,
we have decided to adopt the theme ‘Right of Passage’. A Rite of Passage can be
defined as ceremonies that mark important transitional periods in a person's
life, such as birth, becoming a legal adult, marriage and having children.
However, in adapting the spelling of ‘rite’ to ‘right’, we are interpreting the
meaning to be the freedom of access to any pathway in life, including the
various life markers mentioned above. 
In addition to our new theme, we have also decided this year that
the exhibition will have a focus on installation art, further symbolising and
emphasising the concept of a ‘Rite of Passage’, where exhibition attendees will
be asked to ‘experience’ the art work, and therefore the stories and lives of
the artists themselves, as they wander through various ‘passages’ and pathways
that link the exhibition art work together.
In light of our ambitious ideas for this year’s exhibition, we are
seeking additional funding that will assist us in managing the increased costs
associated with this event, including venue hire, marketing (printing of
posters and flyers), art supplies and materials, construction, catering and
other miscellaneous costs which will arise as we begin the development of the
installation art works. 
What Will You Get In Return?
In return for your pledge, not only will you receive that wonderful warm and fuzzy feeling you get when you assist those who will truly benefit from your help, there are also numerous rewards or 'perks' you will receive depending on the amount you pledge. You will also be able to see where all your generous money has gone via our many posts, updates, photos and blogs across our numerous social media platforms. However, we know not everybody is in a position to help financially, but would still love to support this wonderful cause. We would still be extremely grateful if you can simply spread the word about this campaign, the exhibition and the work we do at ARI. Please post, re-post, share, like, comment, blog etc. etc.ARI would like to thank you in advance for your wonderful generosity. Together, we can use art to change the world, for the better.In creativity, compassion and gratitude,The ARI Team.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","WHAT IS CHANGE COFFEE?
Change Coffee is one day a year when we rally coffee drinkers across the nation
(and soon the globe!) to buy one extra cup of coffee. 

So it's BUY 2, GET 1, with the value of the second cup funding on-the-ground programs for vulnerable kids through our non-profit organisation.

At Change Coffee HQ we know that for the price of a single cup of coffee, once a year, coffee drinkers can literally change the life of a child that has been orphaned or made vulnerable by AIDS. 
WHEN IS CHANGE COFFEE?Annually on the first Friday of December. This year - 4th December 2015!





HOW CHANGE COFFEE WORKS!

It’s simple, it’s easy and it’s fun! Great coffee; a good cause.
First up: Café Owners – These socially responsible 'thought leaders'  will carry the distinctive symbols and branding of #ChangeCoffee and will serve all Change Coffee drinkers their bevvy of choice in a trendy, bright, happy, colourful cup that EVERYONE will want.


Next up: Coffee Drinkers! They drink coffee... so they're already awesome. When they buy their #ChangeCoffee on December 4th from a participating Café they'll be more than awesome; they'll be #ChangeCoffeeAwesome. 
Yes, of course that's an actual thing.




CHANGE COFFEE'S MISSION

We are on a mission to alleviate poverty and improve the lives of orphaned and vulnerable children in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Alleviating poverty is not a task of charity, it is an act of justice. Food, water, shelter, good health, an education and being spoilt are the birthright of all children.
Change Coffee will play it's part in creating this world.

WHO IS BEHIND CHANGE COFFEE?


Hi, I'm Robyn. In 2010, I visited an orphanage in South Africa. The children at the orphanage were more than just statistics; each had a unique story of pain and loss, and yet they approached life with such positivity and enthusiasm, despite some of their very basic needs not being met. 

Humbled and inspired by their warmth and affection, I decided I had to do something to improve the lives of these lost children and established the Eniwe Children’s Fund, a not-for-profit organisation.
Since then Eniwe Children’s Fund has raised over $300,000, and the Eniwe team has seen exciting, tangible results in these impoverished communities that has affirmed my belief in our ability to fundamentally change the lives of these kids.

WHAT WE NEED:
We need funds to enable us to launch big, hard and strong!
The funds we raise here will be used for the following:
Custom Change Coffee Cups
Printed material for marketing and POS information for the cafe's
Logoed T-shirts for our volunteers
Social Media, PR and Experiential marketing
Website design and development

WHAT CHANGE COFFEE CAN ACHIEVE:

Just to give you some perspective here...
1 x Change Coffee will feed 15 children for a day
1 x Change Coffee will feed 1 child for 15 days
25 x Change Coffees will feed 1 child for a whole year
285 x Change Coffees will build a new home for a Child Headed Household

<p>Hi I’m Lynne Stewart the founder and owner of Soul Juicin, a brand new juicing company based out of Victor, NY producing freshly squeezed, healthy, and delicious drinks. Before I speak about the company and my dream, I’d like to explain the drive for developing my company.</p>
<p>My brother Rick Stewart was morbidly obese and our family was always trying to assist him in losing weight. Nothing helped Rick and he ended up contracting ecoli thru his body and died of complications June 26 of 2014. He was only 55 and I lost my brother and friend. My family and I were in shock and it was then that it occurred to me that it was time to make a change in my life and I started juicing again. </p>
<p>Before his death I had juiced and found that it gave me lots of energy instantly but I found it wasn't easy to do as far as the cleanup. After his death and with all the stress, food help provided comfort and with this unhealthy combination, I gained weight. I got away from juicing! </p>
<p>I decided to make a permanent change for myself! Juicing came back into my life and I have a real passion for it and believe strongly that others will benefit from it as well. My brothers situation has provided the drive I needed to make a change in my life as well as helping others. Being that it was difficult and time consuming to do on a small scale in my own kitchen, I researched how I could juice faster and more effectively. </p>
<p>As I was unemployed, I decided to research juicing as a business. This was different from my vast experience in marketing. The inner entrepreneur in me came out and I attended courses at Syracuse University to learn how to grow a company. Besides this knowledge, my contacts and networking list has grown where I now have a solid base of individuals and companies to help me. </p>
<p>Juicing experience and knowledge, along with my marketing experience, and growing network of businesses for the making and selling of juice, has provided me with the tools needed to start a company like this.</p>
<p>The juicing industry and found it to be a Five Billion Dollar industry and is growing 10-15% in the next ten years in each year.  The more I researched the more the juicing business intrigued me.  </p>
<p>A person I know has helped me purchase a Goodnature Coldpress X1 Juicer (1).  This has helped me produce (20-40 gallons ) juice and put this product on the market.   I need another commercial cooler, juice truck to attend festivals, 5k, tough mudders, pay for registration fees for these events, supplies such as labels, cups,fruits and vegetables.My business is growing more each week and I have got connected with Excellus and 37 schools to work with their administration and with University of Rochester for a future pilot program, also have been okd to sell my juice at Canandaigua sport events &amp;  I also do three farm markets which I love . I need a lot  more money than I thought but in the long run it will be totally worth it.I am the first the first Cold Press Juice business in the Finger Lakes I think I can make it BIG and with all the help along with way with all my great friends and family.  SOUL JUICIN I hope will soon be a name everyone talks about when at sport events, family events . Please think changing to a Healthy Drink that will soothe your Soul.

<p>Have you ever envisioned yourself waking up in the morning
on a farm where you’d be required to do everything from collecting eggs to
picking crops? Imagine your morning commute consisted of coffee and a short
walk to the stable or farm, no one beeping, screaming or hustling around in a
constant rush. Although for some this vision could seem like a dream, we are
hoping to make this our reality! </p>
<p><b>Our Plan: </b>Over
the span of three months we hope to embark on a volunteer journey of helping
farmers and communities around the United States build a more self-sufficient and sustainable
being. Around the world communities are struggling due to lack of funds for
labor and that’s where we come in! Farm owners will be providing room and board
for our travels in exchange for the day to day labor needed to keep their farms
running efficiently.  </p>
<p>It has always been a dream to travel the country and be a
part of something that is bigger than me. During these three months we will be
traveling to a variety of states volunteering at numerous farms. We will be
keeping a blog to show the progress as well as an
updated map to see where we have been, who we have helped and where we will be
heading!</p>

<p><b>Where Does The Money
Go: </b></p>
<p><b>Car Stuff: </b>The majority of the money raised will be going towards transportation costs. The average cost of gas per gallon in the U.S is $3.50 per gallon at an estimated 8,000 miles for this journey with an estimated $1,500 dollars in gas (OUCH!) Along with other car costs such as state tolls, oil changes and small maintenance as needed</p>
<p><b>Unexpected Stuff: </b>When
traveling it is only safe to assume

Have you ever envisioned yourself waking up in the morning
on a farm where you’d be required to do everything from collecting eggs to
picking crops? Imagine your morning commute consisted of coffee and a short
walk to the stable or farm, no one beeping, screaming or hustling around in a
constant rush. Although for some this vision could seem like a dream, we are
hoping to make this our reality! 
Our Plan: Over
the span of three months we hope to embark on a volunteer journey of helping
farmers and communities around the United States build a more self-sufficient and sustainable
being. Around the world communities are struggling due to lack of funds for
labor and that’s where we come in! Farm owners will be providing room and board
for our travels in exchange for the day to day labor needed to keep their farms
running efficiently.  
It has always been a dream to travel the country and be a
part of something that is bigger than me. During these three months we will be
traveling to a variety of states volunteering at numerous farms. We will be
keeping a blog to show the progress as well as an
updated map to see where we have been, who we have helped and where we will be
heading!


SO YOU ASK… WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP!

Volunteering will only be providing us with
shelter and 1-2 meals per day, no source of payment.
By providing this volunteer experience without pay farmer can use the extra money for supplies and weatherization projects to keep their land safe!
Help me reach farms that are looking to gain education in solar electricity to help them explore subsidies and reimbursements to take their electricity to a more sustainable level!! 
Because you are awesome and can help us make
this dream a reality not only for us, but also for those we will be helping. 
   What We Need & What You Get

Where Does The Money
Go: 
Car Stuff: The majority of the money raised will be going towards transportation costs. The average cost of gas per gallon in the U.S is $3.50 per gallon at an estimated 8,000 miles for this journey with an estimated $1,500 dollars in gas (OUCH!) Along with other car costs such as state tolls, oil changes and small maintenance as needed
Unexpected Stuff: When
traveling it is only safe to assume
that something terrible and unexpected may occur so a small blanket to help avoid that would be IDEAL!
Volunteer/Farming Stuff: Equipment
that my normal 9-5 office job does not require but my new farming job will
(small tools,gloves, boots etc.)
Food Stuff: While most hosts provide 1-2 meals per day we will be needing funding for food and water in between farms and where hosts can not provided 3 meals a day! 
Other Stuff: Things we are hoping to get to live more efficiently while on the road such as a solar backpack for charging and staying updated, emergency first aid kit, toiletries, reusable bags, water purifiers and more!    The Impact  Farmers will be provided with 2 weeks to 1 month of free labor on their community land projects or farms!  With the saved costs of labor they will be able to make a bigger impact on the sustainability of their community.  Education for me about things I cannot learn in my normal 9-5 office job. I hope to learn as much as possible and educate others when I return. My end hope if to get small groups of people to build knowledge and volunteer themselves. (maybe you will be one of the people who decided a volunteer farm life is for YOU!)    Risks & Challenges  Maybe we will fail, but until we try we will never know 
With a small budget we cannot reach all the farms and communities we would like. The money raised will help ensure that we will not need to end our journey early, the  more funding we raise the longer we can volunteer and the more sustainable and educated we will become!     Other Ways You Can Help  Can't donate online or just don't want to? We can accept cash and check donations that will be added to the campaign! Best part is you'll still get your perks.

Breve Historia de Don Luis y su familia...Don Luis Bustos y su familia vivían en el municipio de El Castillo, departamento del Meta.  En 2002 fueron desplazados por la violencia paramilitar y estatal que se ensañó, especialmente, con los campesinos de la parte alta del municipio y con los líderes sociales. Don Luis y su familia son ambas cosas y, debido a las constantes amenazas, así como a los combates que se estaban librando en su vereda, tuvieron que dejar su mundo, su casa, su hogar, todo aquello por lo que habían luchado y conseguido con trabajo honesto y constante. 



Salieron hacia Villavicencio con apenas lo que pudieron cargar. Llegaron a un barrio de invasión “La Nohora” donde cientos de familias, en condiciones similares a las de ellos, la mayoría de ellas provenientes de la región del Ariari y del Guaviare, se encontraban luchando contra la montaña y las autoridades, para poder armar unos ranchos que, aunque precarios, los guarnecieran de la lluvia y de la noche.  

Vista transversal del rancho


De esta forma, con mucho esfuerzo, construyeron una nueva morada. Utilizaron unas pocas tejas de zinc, un plástico verde que se conoce como “paroi” (quiere decir en la jerga popular “para hoy”) y algo de madera cortada de ese mismo monte. En ese rancho se establecieron y ahí han vivido los últimos 13 años.  Trabajando, pero también esperando una reparación estatal que no llega, un subsidio de vivienda que tampoco se concreta 

Vista frontal del rancho


Cuando los conocimos nos impactó su inteligencia, su nobleza. Su capacidad de lucha a pesar de las vulneraciones y las indignidades. Su continuo liderazgo. Por eso decidimos buscar la manera de darles una mano y apoyarlos. Porque aunque sabemos que es difícil cambiar el mundo e imposible darle una solución a cada una de esas 6,500,000 personas que el conflicto armado ha dejado desplazadas en Colombia (de acuerdo con las cifras oficiales) también sabemos que no podemos quedarnos quietos cuando tenemos la capacidad de contribuir, aunque sea mínimamente, a mejorar algunas realidades.  

Doña Cinia y su hija, al interior del rancho


Así que decidimos unirnos y entre todos, ¡muchos!, ayudar a reemplazar el humilde rancho por una vivienda digna. Vamos bien. La obra ya comenzó con la ayuda económica y mano de obra de familiares y amigos.  Ya desarmamos el rancho, nivelamos el terreno y comenzamos con los cimientos de la nueva casa.  Los materiales de construcción, la mano de obra de los obreros y sobre todo la subida de los materiales al monte son lo más costoso.  Necesitamos de tu ayuda para continuar con la construcción y poder ofrecerle a Don Luis una ayuda solidaria.


Plano de la nueva casa


Estado de la obra después de tres semanas de trabajo



La totalidad de los fondos recaudados, incluso si no llegamos a la meta, serán utilizados en la construcción de la casa y en la adecuación de sus espacios exteriores e interiores. 
De antemano muchas gracias

Brief story of Don Luis and his family...


Don Luis Bustos and his family used to live in “El Castillo” municipality in the department of Meta.  In 2002 they were forcefully displaced by the paramilitary and state violence which principally targeted peasants in the high part of the municipality and the community leaders. Don Luis and his family are both and due to the constant threats to their lives, along with the combats being held in his area, they had to flee their world, their house, their home and everything they had earned with honest and constant work.

They fled to Villavicencio barely with what they were able to carry with them. They arrived at the slum “La Nohora” where hundreds of families in similar conditions, most of them coming from the Ariari and Guaviare regions, were struggling against the mountain and the government in order to build some shanty houses that, no matter how precarious, give shelter from rain and the night. 

Side view of the shanty house


Thus, after much effort, they built their new home. They used some zinc sheets for the roof, some green plastic sheets popullary called “paroi” (this is a slang version of “Para hoy” that means “Just for today”) and some wood planks cut from the nearby trees. In this humble house they have lived for the last 13 years. They have not been only working but also waiting for some state reparations that never come and for a housing allowance that also fails to materialize.

front view of the shanty house


When we met don Luis we were moved by his intelligence, kindness, his continuous leadership and his capacity to fight despite all the indignities and transgressions he has endured. That’s why we have decided to find a way to support them and help them out. Because even though we know it’s hard to change the world and it’s impossible to give a clear solution to the 6,500,000 displaced people by the Colombian internal conflict (According to the Government official record) we also know we cannot stay still when we have the possibility to make a contribution, however small it may be, in order to improve some peoples lives.

Mrs. Cinia and her daughter inside the shanty house



So we have decided o take action, get together, and between all of us to help replace this humble shanty house for a proper, livable house.  the construction has already started with the economic help and workforce of friends and family.  We have already dismantled the shanty house, prepared the field and built the new house's foundations.  The materials, workers, and most of all the transportation of the materials to the site (no roads get here) have been the most expensive.  We need your help to continue with the construction, and be able to offer Don Luis this solidary help.

Blueprints for the new house



Construction site after three weeks' work

The entirety of the funds raised, even if we do not reach the goal, will be invested in the construction of the house and the interior and exterior areas' adaptation.
In advance, thank you!

Bref histoire of Don Luis et sa famille...


Don Luis Bustos et sa famille habitaient à la campagne dans les plaines de l'est de la Colombie au village de El Castillo.  En 2002, dans un des nombreux épisodes de la violence qui sévit depuis plus de cinquante ans au pays, ils ont dû fuir. En effet, les protagonistes de cette épisode n'étaient pas les guérillas mais l'autre acteur très actif : les armes paramilitaires qui agissaient main dans le main avec l'État, s'acharnant sur les paysans et les leaders communautaires. Don Luis et sa famille, faisant partie des deux, et suite aux combats qui se livraient dans sa vereda et à des nombreuses menaces, ont dû partir, quitter tout ce qu'ils connaissaient et tout pour quoi ils avaient travaillé dur et honnêtement.

Ils sont partis à Villavicencio, capitale de la région, juste avec ce qu'ils pouvaient mettre à leur dos, pour s'y installer à une ""comuna"", sortes des favelas colombiennes, connu comme La Nohora. Des centaines des familles, dans des conditions similaires aux leurs et en provenance du sud du pays principalement, y étaient installées. En lutte constante contre les autorités et la montagne, ils avaient réussi à lui arracher un bout de terrain où installer leurs précaires cahutes, petites huttes de fortune qui malgré tout les protège de la pluie et de la nuit.

Vue de coté du cahute


Ainsi et avec beaucoup d'effort ils ont construit leur cahute, avec des toiles en zinc, du bois de la même montagne et du plastic vert nommé ""paroi"" : non pas une appropriation du solide mot français mais en allusion au vocable ""para hoy"", juste pour aujourd'hui.  Là et depuis treize ans, ils continuent ardument leur travail, en attente d'une réparation d'État aux victimes et exilés qui peine d'arriver, afin de reconstruire une vrai maison.

Vue de face du cahute


Quand nous les avons rencontrés leur intelligence, leur humilité, nous ont impacté. Malgré la violence et les outrages ils continuent de lutter, de fédérer. Nous nous sommes donc décidés à les aider. Conscients que, dans une guerre longue de cinquante ans et qui compte désormais - selon les chiffres officiels - plus de six million d'exilés, aider une famille n'est qu'une goutte d'eau dans une mer de détresse, l'immobilité nous est impossible face à la possibilité d'améliorer ne serait ce que le destin de ces cinq personnes. 

Madame Cinia et sa fille à l'intérieur du cahute



Nous nous sommes unis, nombreux ! pour leur aider à transformer leur cahute en une vraie maison. Comme les photos en témoignent, on a déjà commencé les travaux avec l'aide économique et le travail de nos amis et famille.  Nous avons déjà démonté la cahute, préparé le terrain et construit les fondations de la nouvelle maison.  Néanmoins, les matériels et surtout la transportation des mêmes (les vois publiques n'arrivent pas ici) ont été les plus coûteux.  Nous avons donc besoin de votre aide pour continuer avec la construction, et offrir à don Luis et sa famille une aide solidaire.

SOULS was born in San Francisco and we are raising funds to create an online storytelling school and start new chapters in Oakland, Los Angeles, and Brooklyn.



The Vision
Empower people to become storytellers in their communities. In 4 years SOULS of San Francisco built a community of over 150,000 people in 45 countries by sharing the unique energy of San Francisco. Every place has something special to offer so I want to create SOULS chapters in other cities all over the world!
We'll do this by creating a series of online videos to teach:


street photography
how to start a conversation on the street with a stranger
how to conduct an interview
how to create a story from that interview
photo editing techniques
how to use social media to build a community around the work
how to create symbiotic relationships with media outlets
how to use this storytelling skill set to travel


Sidenote: I learned more walking around talking to people in my community in 4 years than I did going to college...I'm just saying!






About Me
Hi there ~ I'm Dijon, a bay area based photographer, filmmaker, writer, and lover of people.
Since 2011 I've taken over 5,000 street portraits with stories. What started as a personal art project has turned into a international movement that spreads love, compassion, and empathy. You may have seen it in SF Weekly, Hoodline, the Huffington Post, SF Gate, or the SF Chronicle!




Recently the content has expanded beyond the street and I've been creating videos and podcasts. Through doing this work I've learned that my happiness comes from service, service to my community. SOULS is how I serve. It's also a great way for people to connect and celebrate each other. I believe the capacity of this project to create cross cultural dialogue and harmony is limitless.    Your generous support will also help cover:
 Hiring a team to help run SOULS: social media manager, website maintenance, community manager, PR person, storytellers (paying myself is included in that) All the perks listed to the right and below
opening SOULS chapters in different cities. Each $10,000 we raise will help us launch in a new city    The Perks

The Impact

 SOULS of Society is committed to uplifting communities: 

We will do at least 2 philanthropic campaigns each year where we tell the stories of a socially minded organization. In 2015 we helped Essie Justice Group raise over $24,000 to help women with incarcerated loved ones, and Lessons for Life raise over $10,000 to give free music lessons to urban youths.
 We'll provide up and coming artist the chance to learn about and celebrate their communities. Artists create culture, and culture is what community is all about. We'll be creating a world wide media network that's people centric. Everyone's perspective is valued and heard.

<strong><i>""All I can say is, 'Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.' I've worked with many healers before to heal my core wounds, but it is Bingz that takes the cake for giving me the most powerful healing sessions I've ever experienced.</i></strong><p></p>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i>Bingz is very intuitive when it comes to where your pain is lurking in your energy body. She expertly guided me to feel the feelings that I had trouble accessing and helped me open the right doors in my heart. Like a gentle, soothing guide with a flashlight, Bingz took me to the deepest part of my pain and from there, all hell broke loose (in a mighty good way).</i></span>
</div>
<p><i>In her healing sessions, I've experienced deep releasing of pain through intense sobbing as well as hysterical laughter (and going back and forth between both), losing my breath, seeing visions in my head and everything in between. By the time we are finished, (and she helps you zero in quite quickly, I might add), it will feel like you started off in hell but somehow ended up in a spiritual cathedral. Where I had given away my power to this person for the last 35 years, by the end of the healing session I gained all my power back. Part roller coaster ride, part dumping ground, part sanctuary, Bingz is a safe place to do the most sacred and delicate work your soul is asking you to do.</i></p>
<p><i>After the healing sessions with Bingz, I feel elated, light, peaceful, free and most of all I feel my core issues have been resolved and released - not chipped away little but little, but cleared. From working with Bingz, for the time time ever she has helped me reach this feeling of flying in the sky, a blissful freedom that I've never, ever known.</i></p>
<p><i>Bingz gently guides you through her 'wonder' statements that help you change the way you access your pain and then ultimately shift them. Her wonder statements, which she crafts on the spot, are potent, depending on the medicine your heart needs at the time.</i></p>
<p><strong><i>Her approach is gentle, inquisitive, curious, compassionate, non-judgmental and peaceful. I feel safe going very deep with Bingz. She is the right healer for you if you are ready to knock out your core issues once and for all. She is an important part of my transformation and I highly recommend letting her take care of you and help you transform from pain to peace.</i></strong></p>

<p><span>Jenna Kyle is a young professional who loves fashion and loves to shop.  Growing up, Jenna was a child model and had aspirations of being a fashion designer- decorating the house with pictures of her sketches.  As she got older, her career interests changed but her love for fashion never faded. </span></p>
<p>In 2013, frustrated with conventional online shopping, Jenna began to think of a solution.  In that moment, the Millénaire™ shopping app was born.  Based on the customer's own favorites, the app provides curated suggestions that allow the user to have a complete shopping experience.  The user is able to purchase items from within the app and bundle shipments.  Gone are the days of searching store after store for one item.  You can favorite an item once and immediately similar items and complimentary outfit pieces will populate on your home screen.</p>Not only does the app provide customers with the satisfaction of shopping smarter, but it allows retailers the ability to capture more sales.  In 2015, clothing and accessories topped the list of all ecommerce sales, coming in higher than computer hardware!  Retailers will be encouraged to partner with Millenaire to provide suggested items that will show up in a user's feed, tailored to their previously favorited items.  It’s a win-win for consumers and retailers alike! <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460774649/J050_1_edited_nkydpi.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/><br/></p>

Millénaire™ is an app that will revolutionize traditional online shopping. Online shopping is a multi-billion dollar business and we are doing it all wrong! Imagine an app that allows you to bundle your selected items from different online retailers; while also providing you with suggested items based on previous likes and purchases. Millénaire™ is that app! 
Features

Team



Jenna Kyle is a young professional who loves fashion and loves to shop.  Growing up, Jenna was a child model and had aspirations of being a fashion designer- decorating the house with pictures of her sketches.  As she got older, her career interests changed but her love for fashion never faded. 
In 2013, frustrated with conventional online shopping, Jenna began to think of a solution.  In that moment, the Millénaire™ shopping app was born.  Based on the customer's own favorites, the app provides curated suggestions that allow the user to have a complete shopping experience.  The user is able to purchase items from within the app and bundle shipments.  Gone are the days of searching store after store for one item.  You can favorite an item once and immediately similar items and complimentary outfit pieces will populate on your home screen.Not only does the app provide customers with the satisfaction of shopping smarter, but it allows retailers the ability to capture more sales.  In 2015, clothing and accessories topped the list of all ecommerce sales, coming in higher than computer hardware!  Retailers will be encouraged to partner with Millenaire to provide suggested items that will show up in a user's feed, tailored to their previously favorited items.  It’s a win-win for consumers and retailers alike! 
Rewards                                        



We are partnering with American Apparel to provide custom Millenaire t-shirts and hoodies!

<div>Current loyalty programs focus on cash-back, points, airline miles, 
and other corporate currencies that are not universally accepted and 
carry unsustainable value over time.<br/><br/><div>
<p>Paper money (fiat money) as an item isn’t actually valuable; it’s 
constantly fluctuating value is only derived from supply and demand. 
Because fiat money isn’t backed by any item of physical worth (like 
gold), its value is completely made-up in conception, and it’s printed 
out of thin air.</p>
<p>Rebates2Riches, meanwhile, uses pure physical gold rewards that have a
 6,000+ year legacy of carrying actual value as currency. Our 
patent-pending formula was created and designed to answer a simple 
question we all share: <br/></p>

<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Rebates in gold have never been done before.</strong> Gold 
never loses value, as all paper or digital fiat currency does, and it’s accepted 
globally, unlike cash-back country-specific currencies and other forms 
of loyalty rewards, such as: points, air miles, corporate-branded 
currencies, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Rebates from shopping purchases are also deemed non-taxable by the IRS</strong>,
 so you keep all of it! It’s simple: shop Amazon or Overstock or any of 
our other affiliated retailers, pay exactly the same price as you 
normally would, but receive (free) gold-back -- it’s a no-brainer!</p>

 that you live a comfortable life filled with all the same shopping that
 you would normally do. Log into R2R, click on our link to your favorite
 online retailer (Amazon, Target, Etsy, eBay, Expedia, etc.), buy 
whatever you want, and just because we brought them business, that 
company will give us a percentage of your purchases (i.e. commissions 
that range between 2-30%). <strong>We return that money 100% to you in the form of pure physical Gold.</strong></p>

rebate.</p>

 you’re shopping and comparing commissions, your options are essentially
 limitless. Through Rebates2Riches, customers will eventually be able to

<p>Most
 Americans (over 60%) have less than $1000 in savings, and the so-called
 millennials generation has a negative 2% savings rate  (i.e. Google it 
!). The rest of much or most of the developed world , now has 
effectively or directive-ly, gone to Negative Interest rates (i.e. 
charging for “safe” savings) in Banks and Bonds, so even the traditional
 savers, like the Japanese and Chinese etc, have started to spend and 
spend and spend. So, R2R is a Natural and logical : Save-Yours (saviors)
 Solution ! The short-term ups and downs of gold prices in terms of 
current fiat currencies valuations, do not matter as much, as you will 
be laying up secured piles of (FREE) Golden Treasures in measures, that 
never go to Zero!</p>

</li> </ul> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","Rebates2Riches (R2R) is a secured savings membership club, where 
members can purchase from their favorite retailers or wholesalers, and 
receive rebates in physical gold. We have a ""1st to Market Advantage"" 
with Gold-back rebates, and secured it with a ""Patent-Pending"" awarded 
status, to eliminate direct competition .

Free gold?! What’s the catch, you ask? There is none!
Products don’t cost you anything more; simply spend what you normally would and watch your tax-free gold pile up.


We are the Uber, Airbnb, or Netflix of the rebates and rewards industry
 and, in some significant ways, possibly all of e-commerce: a true 
“Business Disruptor” that will change how business is done in the 
rebates and rewards sector for years to come. As well as a possible 
shake-up of all of e-commerce,as we ""see"" (match) their discount pricing
 ,and ""raise"" them by a Free Gold-back reward! So,why go anywhere else ?
 No ""Liars Poker ""Bluff, just the indisputable winning-hand! 





 








Current loyalty programs focus on cash-back, points, airline miles, 
and other corporate currencies that are not universally accepted and 
carry unsustainable value over time.
Paper money (fiat money) as an item isn’t actually valuable; it’s 
constantly fluctuating value is only derived from supply and demand. 
Because fiat money isn’t backed by any item of physical worth (like 
gold), its value is completely made-up in conception, and it’s printed 
out of thin air.
Rebates2Riches, meanwhile, uses pure physical gold rewards that have a
 6,000+ year legacy of carrying actual value as currency. Our 
patent-pending formula was created and designed to answer a simple 
question we all share: 






Rebates in gold have never been done before. Gold 
never loses value, as all paper or digital fiat currency does, and it’s accepted 
globally, unlike cash-back country-specific currencies and other forms 
of loyalty rewards, such as: points, air miles, corporate-branded 
currencies, etc.
Rebates from shopping purchases are also deemed non-taxable by the IRS,
 so you keep all of it! It’s simple: shop Amazon or Overstock or any of 
our other affiliated retailers, pay exactly the same price as you 
normally would, but receive (free) gold-back -- it’s a no-brainer!


 










The path to financial freedom looks like this:



The path to financial freedom mandates
 that you live a comfortable life filled with all the same shopping that
 you would normally do. Log into R2R, click on our link to your favorite
 online retailer (Amazon, Target, Etsy, eBay, Expedia, etc.), buy 
whatever you want, and just because we brought them business, that 
company will give us a percentage of your purchases (i.e. commissions 
that range between 2-30%). We return that money 100% to you in the form of pure physical Gold.



We
 even allow customers to see how much commission/rebate they are getting
 prior to purchasing their product. That means that if both Target and 
Walmart carry the same goose down comforter for the same price, you can 
choose to purchase it from whichever one will give you the greater 
rebate.

While
 you’re shopping and comparing commissions, your options are essentially
 limitless. Through Rebates2Riches, customers will eventually be able to
 buy, lease, or rent anything and everything from everyday products to 
new gadgets, travel arrangements, funeral and wedding arrangements, 
medical tourism procedures, and even all types of insurance...and get 
Gold-Back rebates on every purchase.


Banks
 are unreliable. We saw it with Cyprus and we’re seeing it right now 
with Greece – when an economy tanks, banks close and ATMs and online 
banking cease to function because they can’t pay back all the cash 
they’re supposedly holding for depositors. R2R holds all customer Gold 
secured in its entirety (Full Reserve, not fractional), in the biggest 
and best-proven private vaults, completely separate from banks. These 
companies specialize in holding billions in precious metals and hold 
insurance policies through Global insurers like Lloyds of London, and 
constant auditing by the Big 5 Global accounting firms. Or you can take 
physical possession of it .

With
 R2R, you can actually save up to 100% of all the money you’ve ever 
spent over time in the long run. See our ""Do The Math"" video for clarity
 and certainty on this:        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5DFEZjGHek
Our rebates form a passive secure savings that is non-taxable. You 
can even still use your normal rewards credit card to make purchases 
with our associated retailers and collect double rewards: 
points/miles/cash-back from your credit card and Gold from R2R -- 
simultaneously!

While
 your gold continues to pile up while you do nothing at all, you’re free
 to sell any or all of it back to R2R whenever you want. Our accounting 
software will give you 24/7 access to your accounting of funds, so you 
always know how much gold you have as well as its current fiat money 
exchange equivalent.




While
 gold is our staple, we also will allow customers to exchange their 
rebates for silver, as well as numerous and growing traditional fiat 
currencies and Bitcoins. Plus, our own Gold/Silver backed 
Crypto-Currency OMG (OMG= Oh My Gold- TM) Coin (i.e Coming soon...as we have pre-negotiated a proven white-label platform) !



The
 best part of R2R is how simple it is! You don’t even have to think 
about growing your savings because it’s happening automatically. 
Everyday shopping turns into extra ""free"" & REAL money you would 
have never seen before a program like Rebates 2 Riches. 





Most
 Americans (over 60%) have less than $1000 in savings, and the so-called
 millennials generation has a negative 2% savings rate  (i.e. Google it 
!). The rest of much or most of the developed world , now has 
effectively or directive-ly, gone to Negative Interest rates (i.e. 
charging for “safe” savings) in Banks and Bonds, so even the traditional
 savers, like the Japanese and Chinese etc, have started to spend and 
spend and spend. So, R2R is a Natural and logical : Save-Yours (saviors)
 Solution ! The short-term ups and downs of gold prices in terms of 
current fiat currencies valuations, do not matter as much, as you will 
be laying up secured piles of (FREE) Golden Treasures in measures, that 
never go to Zero!
Why? Gold has a ""Pension Envy"" level CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) of
 over 8% over the last 44 years since we went off the Gold for Fiat 
USD-US Treasury Exchange option.
 **Future Returns Disclaimer: Politicians
 will not stop promising and printing , to buy votes and pay for endless
 Warfare and Welfare! So History will surely  be repetitive in this for the foresee-able future! The ONLY true escape from this defined insanity course, is a return to Real Money= Gold...which will send the price of Gold in USD and this CAGR up to the stratosphere! End of Story! 


We’ve made some great progress with R2Rso
 far: we have been awarded patent-pending status by the USPTO for our 
first-of-its-kind rebate to gold conversion program, and so much 
more...you can see, and hear much or most of it all in our documents and

</div></div>","Vieques Island's First Distillery
Crab Island Rum is the first rum legally distilled and bottled in the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico.
2016 is the Year of the Crab and you can be part of it!
Claim your Rum Bottle Vouchers beginning early 2017. Thank you for your support!Pre-Order Crab Island Rum Right Now!

 




Vieques is a small but pretty awesome island southwest of Puerto Rico. It's about three times the size of Manhattan with a rural community of roughly 9,000 people. Surrounded by the best beaches of this Caribbean archipelago and home to one of the brightest bioluminescent bays on the planet.  This is the place I grew up and the island I love.






My name is Ivan Torres Ortiz, and I will be your main rum provider!
Growing up in Vieques is a blessing that words cannot explain. For many locals this island does not offer the kind of job they would like to have after finishing a college education.  For me, Vieques is rich in opportunities and I believe I found mine.
After graduating from college I decided to return to my island. My goal and my desire is to find success here and help others to see all the opportunities that can be cultivated here. Striving for that goal is how I started Crab Island Rum.






It all began from the Viequense tradition of home made rum for the holidays. During that time of the year you can easily find liquor bottles without a label but always with a story behind them. The rest of the year this elixir is absent from everywhere else.  It stays hiding in the woods until next Christmas.
I decided to go inside the forest to find where this rum was hiding and how it was made. I went through all of the experiences from old folks stories and theories of how to do it right to improvised laboratories and books with scientific terminologies that makes you feel like you actually need something to drink.
Through all of that work and searching, I found Crab Island Rum! ""Crab Island"" comes from the name cartographers gave Vieques during the colonization time. When they first visited her shores they found so many crabs that it made their job super easy, and Vieques named herself Crab Island for a while.





Pretty soon our distillery will break the rules of industrialization in the Capital of Rum to become the first artisan-handcrafted spirit in Puerto Rico.
Crab Island is happening and our goal is to be distilling before the end of 2016!

 

Everything started with and idea and the passion of making it happening.  But that is not the beauty of this project.  The most unpredictable and awesome feeling is to be able to spread the same passion to other people that believe in the project and want to be a part of it. It is because of friends and family why we have experienced so much progress in the last year.
6-27-16 Our new still has arrived!





We have a signed lease for an old and abandoned fire station.  This station is one of the remaining structures from the US Navy after they left Vieques in 2003.  The building has the necessary space for the equipment and by today is almost ready to receive them all.

Building has been stripped, scrubbed, primed and painted.
Roof has been patched and sealed.
Building totally rewired and plumbed.
Electric fixtures refurbished and reinstalled.
Bathrooms have been built and tiled.
New security windows and doors purchased and installed.
Rolling doors (three) purchased and installed.
Exterior boiler room constructed.








A new 300g still made out of stainless, copper and glass is on the way!  The expected delivery time is in May 20, 2016.  Besides the still we have:

5 stainless steel tanks for rum fermentation
4 Stainless steel hoses
2 centrifugal pumps
2 paddle agitators
1 New 15 hp Fulton propane boiler
1 Gravity bottle filler machine
1 chiller
1 activated carbon filter system
Lots others miscellaneous that will help to crank this thing up!

The building itself provides awesome structure but there is no easy access to water and electricity.  The closest connection for the electric is six poles away.

<p>Being in New Jersey and visiting local farmstands has really inspired Anthony to take advantage of the diversity of the region's native fruits, vegetables and herbs, from tomatoes to cranberries to blueberries. Ultimately he hopes that these ingredients will make up some really exceptional and unique ales.</p>
<p>The brewery's team plans on launching in late April/early May with a seasonal lineup. You can expect to see maibocks, wheats, saisons, blondes and Anthony is working on a fruity IPA and double IPA. This 7-barrel operation will have 8 rotating taps, so choices will be abundant.</p>
<p>The brewery location, on the corner of Haddon Avenue and Powell Lane, is ideal. It's a great spot for people watching and beer tasting! In addition to floor-to-ceiling windows, the brewery will be fitted out with rustic touches, from reclaimed wood walls to funky Edison lighting fixtures. We think it will be warm and inviting!</p>
<p>Devil's Creek's goal is to be able to offer 32 oz. and 64 oz. growlers to patrons that want to enjoy our beer with a delicious meal at a neighboring eatery, or drafts to customers coming in to taste what we have to offer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kathy Abate, who learned the fine art of home brewing from her husband, has been in the advertising and graphic design field in South Jersey for many years. Kathy plans on keeping the place busy with many events, ranging from special beer tastings to Girls Night Outs to charity events. The brewery is especially looking forward to working with the Collingswood community to help with benefits and fundraising efforts for local worthy causes.</p>

Being in New Jersey and visiting local farmstands has really inspired Anthony to take advantage of the diversity of the region's native fruits, vegetables and herbs, from tomatoes to cranberries to blueberries. Ultimately he hopes that these ingredients will make up some really exceptional and unique ales.
The brewery's team plans on launching in late April/early May with a seasonal lineup. You can expect to see maibocks, wheats, saisons, blondes and Anthony is working on a fruity IPA and double IPA. This 7-barrel operation will have 8 rotating taps, so choices will be abundant.
The brewery location, on the corner of Haddon Avenue and Powell Lane, is ideal. It's a great spot for people watching and beer tasting! In addition to floor-to-ceiling windows, the brewery will be fitted out with rustic touches, from reclaimed wood walls to funky Edison lighting fixtures. We think it will be warm and inviting!
Devil's Creek's goal is to be able to offer 32 oz. and 64 oz. growlers to patrons that want to enjoy our beer with a delicious meal at a neighboring eatery, or drafts to customers coming in to taste what we have to offer.

Kathy Abate, who learned the fine art of home brewing from her husband, has been in the advertising and graphic design field in South Jersey for many years. Kathy plans on keeping the place busy with many events, ranging from special beer tastings to Girls Night Outs to charity events. The brewery is especially looking forward to working with the Collingswood community to help with benefits and fundraising efforts for local worthy causes.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Would you like to see it come back this year? Well, here is your chance to help make that happen, be part of the team, and get some fun perks in the process! </p>
<p>The inhabitants of Vault 131 opened their doors in 2015 to share the unique libations they had spent the last 100 or so years perfecting. This year, that same talented team of entertainers hopes to satisfy your thirsts and entertain your senses in all new ways! But don't fret wastelanders, the atomic blast will most definitely be returning. Running such an awesome party is no easy (or cheap) task, so help make our elaborate dreams for the future a reality!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Some of Vault 131's hopes and dreams:</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Last year most of our bar supplies were donated; this year we need to invest in our own equipment. Making sure our generally closed habitat remains a minimal waste facility is of the utmost importance to us.</li>
<li>After realizing our generators weren't up to last year's challenge, we'll be upgrading our lighting equipment with the newest of power-efficient technologies to provide expert ambience for our honored wasteland visitors.</li>
<li>We are painstakingly testing and adjusting our products for maximum desirability to the varied palates of ConVergence's wastelanders. We also are seeking improved methods for dispensing our exceptional creations. </li>
<li>Our HVAC system broke down early and is in dire need of repair so that it can handle the demands of all the heat you travelers bring in with you. </li>
<li>The area outside of our vault requires attention and Ed needs a better environment to shine in. </li>
<li>Security will be heightened with the addition of motion detecting turrets - your safety is our responsibility!</li>

</div></div>","The Vault Remember that fantastic party room that launched at ConVergence 2015? Would you like to see it come back this year? Well, here is your chance to help make that happen, be part of the team, and get some fun perks in the process! 
The inhabitants of Vault 131 opened their doors in 2015 to share the unique libations they had spent the last 100 or so years perfecting. This year, that same talented team of entertainers hopes to satisfy your thirsts and entertain your senses in all new ways! But don't fret wastelanders, the atomic blast will most definitely be returning. Running such an awesome party is no easy (or cheap) task, so help make our elaborate dreams for the future a reality!   Some of Vault 131's hopes and dreams:


Last year most of our bar supplies were donated; this year we need to invest in our own equipment. Making sure our generally closed habitat remains a minimal waste facility is of the utmost importance to us.
After realizing our generators weren't up to last year's challenge, we'll be upgrading our lighting equipment with the newest of power-efficient technologies to provide expert ambience for our honored wasteland visitors.
We are painstakingly testing and adjusting our products for maximum desirability to the varied palates of ConVergence's wastelanders. We also are seeking improved methods for dispensing our exceptional creations. 
Our HVAC system broke down early and is in dire need of repair so that it can handle the demands of all the heat you travelers bring in with you. 
The area outside of our vault requires attention and Ed needs a better environment to shine in. 
Security will be heightened with the addition of motion detecting turrets - your safety is our responsibility!
And many more tasks and creative improvements will be undertaken as we let our imaginations run wild. The limitations will be dependent upon our funding. 
   What do you get? Let's face it; in the post apocalyptic world, nothing (including help) comes for free. So what will you get for your aide, despite our admiration and appreciation? I'm glad you asked:
 The return of your favorite party room and watering hole!
Goodies, ribbons, special privileges, and karma boosts.
For the most generous supporters, you can count on the envy and admiration of your peers at your superior social status. Many will leave their legacy behind on the very walls of our vault!
All perks will be sealed into a package with your name on it and available for pickup during open hours. For donors reaching team member status, their packages will be available for pick-up an hour prior to official open. 
Please note that donor ribbons and other goodies are only available to friends and team members contributing prior to ConVergence's 2016 kickoff.     Risks & Challenges There's a lot of work and responsibility when bringing such a party to ConVergence. While almost all of our team members are returning this year, many have to cut back their investment (either fiscally or time-wise). Additionally our budget was slightly off last year due to fee's relating to room damages from our guests.   We're positive that with your help we'll be able to return with a bang and be even more impressive than last year!    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute money, you can still help the effort:  Spread the word! Volunteer as a worker, builder, musician, artist, or teamster.

We believe that gardening is healing. The family that originated the Ivan believed this as well, and their farm was a home for agriculture therapy, helping veterans and those with PTSD find healing and balance in their lives.  We are continuing this good work by donating 10% of the proceeds of this campaign to programs that offer agricultural therapy.  </span></p>
<p>These programs will help those with stress-related illnesses, including veterans returning from service. It is estimated that 20% of those returning from active duty will have PTSD and only 50% of those will seek care.

This is where we found ourselves earlier this year.  

We've been growing the Ivan tomato for several years because it was a great tomato with huge production.  It seems to be able to withstand Missouri's weather and pests better than others we have tried. The Ivan tomato has a delicious old fashion favor and a deep meaty structure which does well for fresh tomatoes, canning, and cooking. 
This picture shows you the difference between an Ivan and a grocery store tomato. Which would you rather eat and feed to your family?



We found out that the family who had been growing and selling the Ivan for generations had stopped farming and no longer had any Ivan seeds. We started searching gardening catalogs and asking people about the Ivan.  We found out there were no public sources available for Ivan seeds and that the Ivan had not been in a public catalog since 2011.  With that knowledge, we started The Ivan Tomato Rescue Project. 

 
We are three friends that believe in food supply, heritage heirloom seed preservation, and the healing powers of gardening.  We created a company called Victory Gardeners, and with your help we can save the Ivan Tomato.  To learn more about what we are doing, check out our website at www.victorygardeners.com.  We hope you will support our campaign.

Design and supply Ivan shirts,
     stickers, and aprons to reward our contributors. 
Our goal is to supply between
     1000 and 1600 seed packets through this campaign.


Stage
2) - Growing Ivan Plant Starts for Sale in the Spring Markets and Supply Seeds
to Catalogs and Stores. 

With your support we will
     expand the Ivan production next spring. 
We hope to grow upwards of 2000
     plants and get them into farmers markets and trade shows. 
We will also increasing our
     seed production to supply seeds to catalogs and commercial sales for the
     winter of 2016.
At this point the Ivan seed
     will also be stored in several seed banks ensuring it's safety and
     continuity.  

Stage
3) - Add other endangered and at-risk heirloom varieties to our program and
continue to expand food diversity. 


We hope to raise upwards of $10,000 to help us get this venture off the ground. A portion of the funds will be spent on this years efforts of marketing, packaging, distribution, and Indiegogo campaign costs. The rest will be spent on building our plant stock for next spring, and seed stock for the following winter. In order to do this we need many things, including a market booth and greenhouse supplies. 



We will need to build a greenhouse to get the plant starts going for next spring. Lucky for us, Jordan and Curtis are handy guys and have been gathering windows from old construction jobs. We plan to build our green houses with as much recycled supplies as we can. However, even with the best of intentions, we need some materials to make it happen. If you are excited about what we're trying to do, please consider helping us by contributing directly as a Gold or Platinum Greenhouse sponsor.  

Firstly, everyone will receive our heartfelt thanks and the satisfaction of knowing you have contributed to saving the food chain. We appreciate your support, and want you all to know that only together can we make a difference and save this tomato. 


The Seeds:  

If
     you are a gardener, you will want your own package of limited release Ivan
     seeds.  
You
     can grow them in your backyard or in containers on your porch. Just make
     sure you have fertile soil and keep it well watered.  
You
     will also be welcomed into the Ivan Tomato Rescue Project Facebook group.
     Here Ivan growers can share their experiences with the Ivan, including
     sharing pics of the beauties as they grow.  
With
every sale of seeds you will also get instructions on how to save seeds so you
will be able to grow Ivan's for years to come





Ivan Gear: 



Every donor will receive a Ivan Tomato Rescue Project and a Victory Gardeners Sticker.  

Ivan T-shirts are available in both V-neck and Crew-neck. The shirts are dark blue and have our Ivan Tomato Rescue Logo as Curtis is wearing in the picture above.
Ivan Aprons are available as well. They are red with pockets and have the Ivan Tomato Rescue Logo on it so you can proudly support the future of the food supply while you make your favorite foods. 

Side note: All our Ivan Gear is printed here in Columbia Missouri by Local print shop One to One Print Shop.  They are great people and are doing all they can to help our campaign succeed .    Shout out to...      






Recognition and Shout Outs:

For certain levels of support you can get shout outs on social media, your name on a plaque outside the greenhouse, or a blog post dedicated to yourself, your cause, or your company. Check out the Perks for details. 

We appreciate all levels of support and especially would appreciate it if you would share our videos and posts on social media. This is very easy to do and makes all the difference in the world to getting the word out about this great tomato and this great cause.  





There is one more aspect of our campaign that you should know about. We believe that gardening is healing. The family that originated the Ivan believed this as well, and their farm was a home for agriculture therapy, helping veterans and those with PTSD find healing and balance in their lives.  We are continuing this good work by donating 10% of the proceeds of this campaign to programs that offer agricultural therapy.  
These programs will help those with stress-related illnesses, including veterans returning from service. It is estimated that 20% of those returning from active duty will have PTSD and only 50% of those will seek care. We feel that through working the soil one can begin the process of bringing one's soul back into balance and healing the self.   Help us help others to heal themselves through the therapeutic power of gardening. 


In order to implement our plan of working towards saving the Ivan, we need to meet our goal. However, if we surpass our goal we will be in a position to do some serious good.  



We will be able to expand our reach with the Ivan, growing more starts and saving more seeds for distribution. 

We will be able to supply free seeds and starts to community and school gardeners, allowing many to grow and experience the strength of the Ivan tomato. 
We will be able to add other endangered produce strains to our lineup of plant offerings. 
We will be able to support more agricultural therapy programs, spreading the healing power of gardening. 

So here is our commitment: As each stretch goal is reached we will commit to the following:
$15,000 - we will give away seeds and starts to up to 25 community gardens.  
$20,000 - we will add the Nepalese Bell to our growing program for this summer, helping to expand the reach of this rare and wonderful pepper.  
$25,000 - we will provide seed or starts for up to 25 K-12 school based gardening programs. 
We want to do as much good as possible and build a viable business based on saving rare and endangered produce varieties. Please help us and support our campaign. 
Help us save the food chain, one tomato at a time.  
Your contributions to our campaign are going to help heal the planet, the food chain, and those in need. This is the Ivan Rescue Project. We are Victory Gardeners and we are thankful for your support.",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

The idea for our store has slowly developed over the last several years. My journey began many years ago as I searched for answers to my long list of health problems. While traditional doctors were unable to get to the root of my issues, the natural healing community came to my rescue! It was love at first sight! A lot has happened in the last few years which has led me to finally making one of my dreams come true and opening a place where people can come learn, be empowered, and have access to quality nutritional products. Be Well Nashville will be much more than just a retail store. It will be a place where  people can learn more about their bodies and health and support each other on their journeys to better eating, living and thinking. Having someone with my knowledge and personal experiences will give an added bonus to visiting the store. My goal is to offer HOPE to those struggling, to educate those who wish to learn and to bring awareness to the community for healthy living. Be Well Nashville will open in late January, 2016 and will be located in the Shoppes on Fatherland, Suite 104, in the booming historical district of East Nashville.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We will be starting with an empty 400 sq foot space so painting will be our first priority. We will be using BEHR's premium paint. This is a low &amp; zero VOC paint for improved air quality and reduced toxins released by traditional paints.</p>
<p>We will need to purchase product shelves, a check out counter, furniture and retail POS equipment, as well as a small refrigerator for our probiotics and fish oils. We have an adorable outdoor patio we will furnish for an area where folks can come and read or just sit and share their story.  The store will be stocked with high quality, super pure nutritional supplements and herbal products, as well as protein powders, essential oils, organic coconut oil, organic feminine products, personal development/health books, music therapy CD's,  children's supplements and a couple of products for our furry family members, too! We will be looking for furniture for our indoor sitting area that will allow for folks to come read a book from our learning corner or share a cup of tea with a friend.</p>
<p>We will be purchasing wooden folding chairs for our weekly and monthly wellness classes. We will offer 8 week Wellness Wednesday classes, as well as Tuesday Talks led by myself and other local health practitioners. </p>
<p>We realize that our campaign amount may not allow for everything but will allow us to get started with some of the basics and add on from there as we begin to grow!</p>
<p>If we raise more than our goal then we will use it  to go ahead and update our website where folks living out of town can shop our quality products and attend webinars to learn more about living well!</p>

<h2>Aidez-nous à parrainer une famille de réfugiés syriens<br/>
</h2>
<p>Le Canada s’est engagé à accueillir 35 000 réfugiés syriens au Canada, et l’échéance est maintenant reportée à la fin de 2016. Nous voulons que Hania et ses enfants Adnan (25 ans), Nour (20 ans) et Nour Aldeen (10 ans) fassent partie de ce nombre. Nous les parrainons pour qu’ils viennent à Montréal et nous avons besoin de votre aide.</p>
<p>Pour parrainer une famille de réfugiés, nous devons leur fournir un soutien financier complet pendant leur première année au Canada et les aider à s’installer et à s’intégrer à la société québécoise. Le gouvernement du Québec suggère 55 000 $ comme montant nécessaire au soutien d'une famille. Ensemble, nous avons pu réunir 20 000 $. Nous devons donc recueillir 35 000 $ de plus, soit l’objectif de notre campagne Indiegogo.</p>
<p>Nous vous serions infiniment reconnaissants pour votre don, quel qu'en soit le montant. Nous pensons que les membres de cette famille deviendront de grands Canadiens! Voici leur histoire.</p>
<h2>L’histoire de Hania et de sa famille</h2>
<p>Avant le conflit, la famille Zlikha vivait dans un beau petit appartement à Qaboun, une banlieue de Damas. Hania travaillait comme ingénieure civile pour le service informatique de Syrian Arab Airlines et était chef de famille depuis le décès du père des enfants. Adnan a fini le lycée au troisième rang de tous les étudiants de Syrie. Nour était aussi une des premières de classe l’année où elle a obtenu son diplôme. Les enfants fréquentaient de bonnes écoles et étudiaient fort pour leur avenir.</p>
<p>Tout a changé en 2011. L’aîné, Adnan, étudiait en science informatique à l’Université de Damas, mais a dû cesser ses études lorsque la ville est devenue une zone de guerre. Alors que Nour était en train de faire l’examen final de ses études secondaires, des bombes étaient larguées sur les écoles.</p>
<p>Peu après le début de la guerre, la ville où vivait la famille est devenue très dangereuse. La famille a vu des tanks passer sur des personnes capturées. Ils ont vu des hommes et des femmes abattus et laissés au sol. Ils ont entendu les cris des mères qui avaient perdu leurs enfants et leurs maris. Les bombes tombaient et il y avait des tireurs partout autour de leur immeuble et même à l’intérieur.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448998448/fj1nxzxtsqfyxyszpygv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Photo : Nik Millard (BBC)<br/></p><p>Un jour, ils ont entendu dire que les gens étaient autorisés à quitter leur maison. Ils ont pris leurs documents, leurs ordinateurs, des sacs à dos avec quelques vêtements et des chaussures, et se sont enfuis. Depuis ce jour, ils écoutent les nouvelles chaque jour et entendent parler des combats dans leur ville d’origine. Les images à la télévision montrent qu’ils n’ont plus de maison où retourner.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448998491/cjzb1nwsnhdlao45kna1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Photo : Nik Millard (BBC)<br/></p><p>La famille a d’abord fui à Damas, puis au Liban, où Hania travaille dans la cuisine d’un restaurant et fait la classe à son plus jeune fils. Nour a dû arrêter ses études et travaille dans un restaurant où elle gagne 300 $ par mois.</p>
<p>Ce sont des gens intelligents, bons et honnêtes, qui aiment tellement les chiffres qu’ils se lancent continuellement le défi d’un problème mathématique afin de voir qui va le résoudre en premier! Ils aiment les activités extérieures. Tous les membres de la famille font de la natation et ont fait beaucoup de randonnée dans les montagnes. Nour et Hania sont très bonnes cuisinières.</p>
<h2>Qui sommes-nous</h2>
<p>Je m’appelle Heba Zlikha et Hania est ma sœur aînée. Je suis arrivée au Canada avec mes deux enfants il y a 11 ans et je travaille maintenant dans le domaine de l’acupuncture. Mes enfants parlent le français, l’anglais et l’arabe, et nous sommes pleinement intégrés à la société canadienne. Nous adorons vivre ici! Je n’ai pas de famille au Canada et ce serait un rêve d’avoir Hania et ses enfants avec nous. Je reçois de l’aide de mes partenaires commanditaires, mon cher ami Elio, qui est comme ma famille canadienne, et ma nouvelle amie Anna qui est médecin de famille à Montréal.</p>
<p>J’ai lancé une collecte de fonds et, à nous trois, nous avons réussi à recueillir 20 000 $.</p>
<p>Nous avons besoin en tout de 55 000 $ et nous nous engageons à soutenir la famille et à l’aider à s’installer au Canada. Nous vous serions éternellement reconnaissants de toute aide que vous pouvez nous fournir et nous vous demandons de faire connaître notre campagne à vos amis. Voir les liens ci-dessus.</p>
<h2>Autres renseignements</h2>
<p>Les dons ne sont pas déductibles du revenu imposable; veuillez en tenir compte pour décider du montant que vous voulez donner.</p>
<p>Si vous préférez payer par chèque ou argent comptant, veuillez contacter l'un de nous et il nous fera plaisir de prendre les dispositions nécessaires avec vous.</p>
<p>Tout l’argent amassé grâce à cette campagne sera placé dans un compte en fiducie géré par notre avocate en droit de l'immigration, Miriam McLeod,  jusqu’à ce que la famille arrive et en ait besoin.</p>
<p>Si, par hasard, nous recevons plus d’argent que ce que nous demandons, toute somme supplémentaire servira à payer des études universitaires à Nour et Adnan.</p>

<h2>Help Us Sponsor a Syrian Refugee Family<br/>
</h2>
<p>Canada has committed to bringing 35 000 Syrian refugees to Canada, now by the end of 2016. We want Hania and her children Adnan (25), Nour (20), and Nour Aldeen (10) to be among them. We are sponsoring them to come to Montreal and we need your help.</p>
<p>Sponsoring a refugee family means that we must completely financially support them for their first year in Canada as well, as help them settle and integrate into Quebec society. The Quebec government suggests $55 000 as the amount needed to support the family. Together, we are able to put in $20 000. Our goal is to raise the other $35 000 through this Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>We would be forever grateful for whatever amount you are able to donate. We think they will make great Canadians! Here is their story.</p>
<h2>The Story of Hania and her Family</h2>
<p>Before the conflict, the Zlikha family was living in a small, cute apartment in Qaboun, a suburb of Damascus. Hania was working as a civil engineer for Syrian Arab Airlines in their IT department and supporting her children, who had lost their father when they were really young. Adnan finished high school with the third highest marks in Syria. Nour was also in the top of her class the year she was graduating. The children were in good schools, studying hard to make a future.</p>
<p>All that changed in 2011. Adnan, the eldest, was studying computer engineering at Damascus University, but had to stop when it became a war zone. Nour did her high school final exam while bombs were falling on schools.</p>
<p>Shortly after the war started, the town where they lived became really dangerous. They saw tanks driving over live captured people. They saw men and women being shot and left on the ground. They heard the screaming of mothers who lost their kids and husbands. Bombs and snipers were everywhere on and around the building they lived in.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448998448/fj1nxzxtsqfyxyszpygv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: right;"">Photo : Nik Millard (BBC)</p><p>One day they heard that people were being allowed to leave their houses. They took only their documents, their computers, back bags with some clothes and shoes, and fled. They hear on the news every day since then about the battles happening there. Pictures from the television show there is nothing to go home to.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448998491/cjzb1nwsnhdlao45kna1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: right;"">Photo : Nik Millard (BBC)<br/></p><p>The family fled first to Damascus and then to Lebanon, where Hania is working in a restaurant kitchen and home schooling her youngest son. Nour has had to stop going to school altogether and works in a restaurant making $300 a month.</p>
<p>They are intelligent, good and honest people, with such a love of numbers they always have a math problem as a challenge between them to see who will solve it first ! They love activities outside. They all swim and did lots of hiking in the mountains. Nour and Hania are really good cooks.</p>
<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>My name is Heba Zlikha and Hania is my older sister. I came to Canada with my two children 11 years ago and now work in the field of accupuncture. My children speak French, English and Arabic and we are fully integrated into Canadian life. We love it here! I have no family in Canada and it would be a dream to have Hania and her children with us. Helping me as co­sponsors are my dear friend Elio, who is like my Canadian family and my new friend Anna, who is a Montreal family doctor.</p>
<p>I have been fundraising on my own and between the three of us we are able to put in $20 000.</p>
<p>We need a total of $55 000 and are committed to supporting the family and getting them settled well in Canada. We would be forever grateful for whatever help you can manage and we ask you to please share our campaign with your friends. See the links at the top.</p>
<h2>Other Info</h2>
<p>Donations are not tax­ deductible so please take this into account when deciding how much you would like to give.</p><p>If you prefer to pay by cheque or cash, please contact one of us, and we will gladly organize that with you.<br/></p>
<p>All money raised with this campaign will be placed in the trust account of our immigration lawyer, Miriam McLeod, until such time as the family arrives and it is needed by them.</p>
<p>In the amazing situation that we receive more money than we are asking for, any extra money will be used to pay for university expenses for Nour and Adnan.</p></div>","--> Click here to read the English version! <--

Nous vous serions infiniment reconnaissants pour votre don, quel qu'en soit le montant. Nous pensons que les membres de cette famille deviendront de grands Canadiens! Voici leur histoire.
L’histoire de Hania et de sa famille
Avant le conflit, la famille Zlikha vivait dans un beau petit appartement à Qaboun, une banlieue de Damas. Hania travaillait comme ingénieure civile pour le service informatique de Syrian Arab Airlines et était chef de famille depuis le décès du père des enfants. Adnan a fini le lycée au troisième rang de tous les étudiants de Syrie. Nour était aussi une des premières de classe l’année où elle a obtenu son diplôme. Les enfants fréquentaient de bonnes écoles et étudiaient fort pour leur avenir.
Tout a changé en 2011. L’aîné, Adnan, étudiait en science informatique à l’Université de Damas, mais a dû cesser ses études lorsque la ville est devenue une zone de guerre. Alors que Nour était en train de faire l’examen final de ses études secondaires, des bombes étaient larguées sur les écoles.
Peu après le début de la guerre, la ville où vivait la famille est devenue très dangereuse. La famille a vu des tanks passer sur des personnes capturées. Ils ont vu des hommes et des femmes abattus et laissés au sol. Ils ont entendu les cris des mères qui avaient perdu leurs enfants et leurs maris. Les bombes tombaient et il y avait des tireurs partout autour de leur immeuble et même à l’intérieur.
Photo : Nik Millard (BBC)Un jour, ils ont entendu dire que les gens étaient autorisés à quitter leur maison. Ils ont pris leurs documents, leurs ordinateurs, des sacs à dos avec quelques vêtements et des chaussures, et se sont enfuis. Depuis ce jour, ils écoutent les nouvelles chaque jour et entendent parler des combats dans leur ville d’origine. Les images à la télévision montrent qu’ils n’ont plus de maison où retourner.
Photo : Nik Millard (BBC)La famille a d’abord fui à Damas, puis au Liban, où Hania travaille dans la cuisine d’un restaurant et fait la classe à son plus jeune fils. Nour a dû arrêter ses études et travaille dans un restaurant où elle gagne 300 $ par mois.
Ce sont des gens intelligents, bons et honnêtes, qui aiment tellement les chiffres qu’ils se lancent continuellement le défi d’un problème mathématique afin de voir qui va le résoudre en premier! Ils aiment les activités extérieures. Tous les membres de la famille font de la natation et ont fait beaucoup de randonnée dans les montagnes. Nour et Hania sont très bonnes cuisinières.
Qui sommes-nous
Je m’appelle Heba Zlikha et Hania est ma sœur aînée. Je suis arrivée au Canada avec mes deux enfants il y a 11 ans et je travaille maintenant dans le domaine de l’acupuncture. Mes enfants parlent le français, l’anglais et l’arabe, et nous sommes pleinement intégrés à la société canadienne. Nous adorons vivre ici! Je n’ai pas de famille au Canada et ce serait un rêve d’avoir Hania et ses enfants avec nous. Je reçois de l’aide de mes partenaires commanditaires, mon cher ami Elio, qui est comme ma famille canadienne, et ma nouvelle amie Anna qui est médecin de famille à Montréal.
J’ai lancé une collecte de fonds et, à nous trois, nous avons réussi à recueillir 20 000 $.
Nous avons besoin en tout de 55 000 $ et nous nous engageons à soutenir la famille et à l’aider à s’installer au Canada. Nous vous serions éternellement reconnaissants de toute aide que vous pouvez nous fournir et nous vous demandons de faire connaître notre campagne à vos amis. Voir les liens ci-dessus.
Autres renseignements
Les dons ne sont pas déductibles du revenu imposable; veuillez en tenir compte pour décider du montant que vous voulez donner.
Si vous préférez payer par chèque ou argent comptant, veuillez contacter l'un de nous et il nous fera plaisir de prendre les dispositions nécessaires avec vous.
Tout l’argent amassé grâce à cette campagne sera placé dans un compte en fiducie géré par notre avocate en droit de l'immigration, Miriam McLeod,  jusqu’à ce que la famille arrive et en ait besoin.
Si, par hasard, nous recevons plus d’argent que ce que nous demandons, toute somme supplémentaire servira à payer des études universitaires à Nour et Adnan.

Help Us Sponsor a Syrian Refugee Family

Canada has committed to bringing 35 000 Syrian refugees to Canada, now by the end of 2016. We want Hania and her children Adnan (25), Nour (20), and Nour Aldeen (10) to be among them. We are sponsoring them to come to Montreal and we need your help.
Sponsoring a refugee family means that we must completely financially support them for their first year in Canada as well, as help them settle and integrate into Quebec society. The Quebec government suggests $55 000 as the amount needed to support the family. Together, we are able to put in $20 000. Our goal is to raise the other $35 000 through this Indiegogo campaign.
We would be forever grateful for whatever amount you are able to donate. We think they will make great Canadians! Here is their story.
The Story of Hania and her Family
Before the conflict, the Zlikha family was living in a small, cute apartment in Qaboun, a suburb of Damascus. Hania was working as a civil engineer for Syrian Arab Airlines in their IT department and supporting her children, who had lost their father when they were really young. Adnan finished high school with the third highest marks in Syria. Nour was also in the top of her class the year she was graduating. The children were in good schools, studying hard to make a future.
All that changed in 2011. Adnan, the eldest, was studying computer engineering at Damascus University, but had to stop when it became a war zone. Nour did her high school final exam while bombs were falling on schools.
Shortly after the war started, the town where they lived became really dangerous. They saw tanks driving over live captured people. They saw men and women being shot and left on the ground. They heard the screaming of mothers who lost their kids and husbands. Bombs and snipers were everywhere on and around the building they lived in.Photo : Nik Millard (BBC)One day they heard that people were being allowed to leave their houses. They took only their documents, their computers, back bags with some clothes and shoes, and fled. They hear on the news every day since then about the battles happening there. Pictures from the television show there is nothing to go home to.Photo : Nik Millard (BBC)The family fled first to Damascus and then to Lebanon, where Hania is working in a restaurant kitchen and home schooling her youngest son. Nour has had to stop going to school altogether and works in a restaurant making $300 a month.
They are intelligent, good and honest people, with such a love of numbers they always have a math problem as a challenge between them to see who will solve it first ! They love activities outside. They all swim and did lots of hiking in the mountains. Nour and Hania are really good cooks.
Who we are
My name is Heba Zlikha and Hania is my older sister. I came to Canada with my two children 11 years ago and now work in the field of accupuncture. My children speak French, English and Arabic and we are fully integrated into Canadian life. We love it here! I have no family in Canada and it would be a dream to have Hania and her children with us. Helping me as co­sponsors are my dear friend Elio, who is like my Canadian family and my new friend Anna, who is a Montreal family doctor.
I have been fundraising on my own and between the three of us we are able to put in $20 000.
We need a total of $55 000 and are committed to supporting the family and getting them settled well in Canada. We would be forever grateful for whatever help you can manage and we ask you to please share our campaign with your friends. See the links at the top.
Other Info
Donations are not tax­ deductible so please take this into account when deciding how much you would like to give.If you prefer to pay by cheque or cash, please contact one of us, and we will gladly organize that with you.
All money raised with this campaign will be placed in the trust account of our immigration lawyer, Miriam McLeod, until such time as the family arrives and it is needed by them.
In the amazing situation that we receive more money than we are asking for, any extra money will be used to pay for university expenses for Nour and Adnan.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Dear Family and Friends!</b></p>
<p>We (Chanie Hoelsken and Christopher Campbell, longtime friends and
colleagues) are excited to tell you about a wonderful project we initiated
in response to the tragic fires that recently happened in our beloved Lake
County, California.  Recognizing the <b>profound trauma</b> incurred by thousands
of people in the area, we wanted to create the possibility for long-term healing and well-being - not just a one-time ""quick fix.""  So we launched <b>Valley Fire Healing Services</b> (aka <b>Project Phoenix/Lake County</b>).  We have already established a team of skilled practitioners, held our first Community Healing Circle and Free Clinic in Lake County, and there's more to come.  Please read on to find out what we've been up to, and how you might help us continue this good work.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>BEAUTIFUL RESULTS ALREADY</b></p>
<p>In the last month, we have heard countless tragic stories of lost homes, pets, jobs, devastated lands.  We have witnessed the strain in the faces, hearts, and minds of our friends and community members, of local parents, home and business owners. So many people have experienced loss beyond our imagination.  Even those who did not lose their homes are surrounded by destruction and grief - which all contributes to a deep shock to the system.  Our hearts go out to them - and we wish we had a way to help.</p><p><b>WE DO.</b></p><p>This past month, we were able to serve <b>350 people </b>(and also some rescue animals!)  -  through events, circles, and clinics in Lake and Napa counties, and in the San Francisco Bay Area.  </p><p>Our first <b>Community Healing Circle</b> in Lake County drew a packed room of participants from all sectors of the surrounding community, some of whom had never attended an event like this before!  It was amazing to see the glow on their faces and the relief in their hearts, after having spent just a couple of hours with fellow community members in a healing environment.  Within a day or two, people were asking: ""<i>When is the next healing circle</i>?""  Then, last Sunday, we led our first of 12 monthly <b>Free Healing Clinics</b>. We had 9 practitioners and were able to offer 51 - yes FIFTY ONE - free treatments to grateful locals - (some of whom have never even had a massage in their life!)</p><p>And the work continues.  We (Chanie and Christopher) are working collaboratively together - and with our team of skilled healers and teachers - to create several <b>Self-Care Seminars</b> and <b>Resiliency Training Programs</b> that we will lead throughout the next year empowering people to carry these healing practices into their homes and families as everyone faces the struggles that undoubtedly lie ahead.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>FROM TRAGEDY, HELP US CREATE OPPORTUNITY</b><br/></p>
<p>Lake County is the <b>second poorest county in California</b>.  Many
of these people have lived in impoverished circumstances and would have never
otherwise been able to receive the services we are providing - high quality healing
treatments, psychotherapy, grief counseling and resiliency coaching.  And, yet, now we are now able to offer
them healing and support to heal their pains and grief, discover their own
inner strength and creativity, and be part of a community that they never had
access to before. What we are capable of doing this next year is immense - and<i>

<p>We are reaching out to ask for your help as we move forward and
continue to offer these wonderful services to the community.  By contributing generously to our initiative, you are not just
providing for the basic needs of these people on a one-time basis, you are <b>providing them with the ongoing resources

year - helping them through the challenges of <b>creating a new and better life for them</b><b>selves</b>.  </p>
<p><b><i>Please contribute as generously as you can. </i></b> Your contribution will go a long way in supporting us to support these wonderfully deserving folks.</p><p>If you cannot offer a financial

Have a behind the scenes look at the endless discussion that leads to the perfect flavour you taste each time you have a sip of Unity Jun.UPDATE: Wondering what's up with the Unity Jun Gun?! Check out the video below from our Jun Gun Fun! day at Ingredients:Unity Jun is a living elixir full of antioxidants, b-vitamins and probiotics. It’s kombucha’s wild cousin that eats raw honey instead of refined sugar. We craft our delicious Jun with raw local honey, organic teas & herbs, really awesome water, and the Jun SCOBY—a powerful, symbiotic culture of beneficial probiotics.We're launching this campaign to help spread the culture far and wide! In order to truly bring Unity Jun to YOU, we need to bring it to all of the stores, markets and establishments across Coastal BC that you love! We’re ready and willing to increase production and start filling our cute new bottles with fresh, sparkly Jun.To reach this next level we need YOUR help to acquire new equipment, thousands of bottles and barrels of honey! For more detail on the specific phases of growth your contributions will benefit, scroll down (“Where your contributions are going”).As a local, grassroots organization, we are committed to funding Unity Jun collectively, from the ground up, rather than appealing to investors who seek to make a profit by sharing ownership. This approach empowers our greater vision of giving back to our collective communities, and allows for an organic growth model.ABOUT JUNUnity Jun is a delicious, fizzy drink that consistently inspires smiles of delight! It’s kombucha’s wild cousin that eats raw honey instead of refined sugar. Making Jun requires help from the lovable Jun SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria & Yeast), which looks like a crazy, floating jellyfish mushroom! The Jun culture is rumoured to have come from Tibet, where it was used to bring greater health & vitality to meditating monks. To craft this living elixir, we start by steeping the finest organic teas in our really awesome water. Then, we add raw, local honey and the magical Jun SCOBY. The goodness of the plants & bees is then transmogrified by the SCOBY into an effervescent tonic full of antioxidants, b-vitamins, digestive enzymes and probiotics. Next, this liquid goodness is infused with flavourful organic herbs & spices before being poured into (possibly) the cutest bottles ever made.RELATIONSHIPS and the NEW ECONOMYCrafting Jun wouldn’t be possible without cultivating symbiotic relationships throughout our communities. We source all of our ingredients from producers & suppliers who seek to grow a sustainable local economy. Together, we practice conscious engagement with the earth and new ways of being. Presently, we are in relationship with:
Ingredients Cafe & Health Food Store: Our home base, and the first location to have Unity Jun available for public sale. Cindy and the Ingredients team are committed to building & supporting a vibrant local food hub in Victoria, BC. They have been instrumental in providing the space, support, and loving encouragement we need to get Unity Jun up and running.
Fredrich’s Honey: 2nd generation beekeepers, consciously gathering wild honey across Vancouver Island, and delivering us pails of their raw, nectary goodness.
JagaSilk: purveyors of the finest direct-trade teas. Jared regularly visits farms across the ocean and cultivates personal relationships with the tea farmers.
Studio Robazzo: a new, sustainability-focused design studio in Victoria BC; Studio Robazzo is committed to transforming our relationship with all manner of things—away from the disposable consumer economy and toward one that considers the full life cycle of what we produce and use. They have done fantastic work designing our logo, signage, labels and other materials.
Over Grow the System, Dodd’s Eye Media, and Anchor Hill: Syd, Andrew & Rich are collectively responsible for our wonderful campaign video & media support. They are all amazing creative geniuses who we feel blessed to work with.
Organic Matters: organic wholesalers, based in Nelson, BC, Organic Matters aims to supply the BC community with the most locally- and ethically-sourced organic ingredients they can find, reducing waste & forging healthy relationships in the process. They supply many of our organic herbs & spices.
Ancient Futures Clothing: Working out of the Cowichan Valley on Vancouver Island, Ali hand dyes and sews beautifully-cozy and unique articles of clothing using awesome and sustainable materials—like the organic merino wool we use as cloth covers for our SCOBY and Jun barrels!
Sunset Labs, Moon Collective, Returning Saturn, Luminosity Project, and other organizers of community events across Coastal BC. Our local arts community is large, healthy and tight-knit—full of great people doing what they love and putting community ahead of profits. Unity Jun will be forever grateful to this community for their endless warmth and support.

Our year-round shelter also provides:


Access to social services


Life skills and life enrichment classes

The money will go to startup costs for Bread & Roses Thrift and More, including leasing a building; refurbishing the building; purchasing equipment, a vehicle (for picking up furniture), advertising, and insurance; paying initial wages to one full-time and one part-time manager with thrift store, management, and job-training expertise. 
If you care about helping the homeless people in our community get back on their feet, please contribute to our Bread & Roses Thrift and More campaign to support the vital services at Hospitality House.



LET US SHOW YOU OUR GRATITUDE!  For Helping to Open Bread & Roses Thrift and More, Here Are The Great Perks We've Put Together To Thank You!







The name Bread & Roses comes from a song by that name that Utah Phillips sang. Its lyrics express the universal human desire for a life that satisfies both physical needs and more soulful needs for learning and beauty — ""a sharing of life's glories.""  

Bread & Roses Thrift and More Team
The volunteers who are creating Bread and Roses
are all talented artists and thrift store aficionados who will transform our
space into a visual experience that will itself be a work of art.

<h1><b>What are we doing? </b></h1>
<p>Our goal is to create the first ever Haystack Food Truck. It’s purpose is to be used to in public settings (food truck gatherings, events, schools, churches, camp meetings, etc) to promote the SDA food staple,<i> the haystack</i>. Our haystack is a taco salad with a twist: you can <b>stack it </b>or <b>wrap it</b>. Whichever you choose, a meal will be donated to someone in need. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h1><b>Why are we doing this?</b></h1>
<p>Food trucks are growing in popularity all across America and thrive on their uniqueness. We are leveraging this ""uniqueness"" to reach out to the community. We can also use this opportunity to feed those that are hungry and less fortunate. We're taking our passion for haystacks and using it to change the world. </p>

<p>For our flyers to reach out to 1,000 business and home addresses, we need 599.69 CAD which includes  531.59 CAD printing &amp; mailing fee plus 68.10 CAD in taxes. Indiegogo will take 5% and PayPal will take another 3% of this amount, thus our ""ask"" is 651.84 CAD or roughly 652 CAD. <br/></p>
<p><b>What you get</b>:</p>
<p>For every contribution we offer you a service equal to the amount you contribute. For example, for 20 CAD we can proofread your 1,000-word text or translate 200 words for you from or to English, French, Spanish, Dutch, German, Russian. For 50 CAD we can write a 500-word text for you or offer you 1 hour consultation for your academic work, thesis or dissertation. For 100 CAD we can write a 1,000-word text for you, translate a 1,000-word text, or offer you a 2 hour consultation for your academic work or your business content writing. In other words we can translate your text at 10 cents/word, edit it at 5 CAD/page of 250 words, write a text for you at 25 CAD/page of 250 words. Just state your goal and we will work with you towards achieving it!<br/></p>

If you are in need of a translation service (from/to English, French, Spanish, Russian, Dutch, German) for your business or your personal needs (please note we do not translate driver's license, birth/marriage certificates, diplomas, transcripts), this is where we bring value. If you need the work done fast, hassle-free, high-quality, affordable, and confidential, this is where we bring value.

<h2>Empowerment Solar Will Energize the Middle East.</h2>
<p>Our solar projects will foster energy independence and economic prosperity for individuals and business owners across the Middle East and North Africa, by supplying affordable and easy access to reliable, clean, distributed solar electricity.</p>
<p>I witnessed first-hand the links between energy, prosperity, stability and peace as a U.S. Marine Corps officer, while patrolling the streets of Ramadi, Iraq in 2004<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">. When insurgents cut Ramadi’s power lines, instability and violence proliferated around black markets for generators, their fuel, and water (since the water pumps were run by electricity). Staring at Iraq’s powerful sun, it became clear to me that distributed solar electricity could play an extraordinary role in building a brighter future for the entire region. </span></p>
<p>Empowerment Solar is our vision to help the people of the Middle East solve these types of challenges themselves. By designing and installing distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity systems, for small-and-mid-sized Palestinian businesses in the West Bank, we put electric and economic power back into the hands of everyday Palestinians, creating jobs and promoting a more prosperous and stable future. Our dream is to then extend this model of energy empowerment across the Middle East.</p>
<h2>Become a part of Empowerment Solar and receive great perks.</h2>
<p>With support from contributors like you, we will be able to bring Empowerment Solar to life. </p>
<p>We need to raise $50,000 to open our doors, train our staff, and develop our first solar project.</p>
<p>There are a number of perks available for your contribution, from your name on the Empowerment Solar website, to your personal sponsorship of your own solar panel, to a tour of the project site once it's complete. </p>
<p>Every little bit helps!  This is just the start of Empowerment Solar and any amount now helps us put the pieces in place to build sustainable energy solutions for communities throughout the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<h2>Beginning with the Palestinian West Bank</h2>
<p>In 2014, Israel provided 99% of the West Bank’s electricity, draining $400-700M from the Palestinian economy. Today, Palestinian firms pay 10.3% more than Israelis and 64.3% more than Americans for electricity despite the fact that Israel’s per capita GDP is 7.3 times that of the Palestinians’ and the U.S.’s is 12.1 times greater.  Palestinians also face an unreliable grid, plagued by brownouts and shortages. Grid reliability and costs will only worsen, as the U.N. predicts that “by 2020 there could be an electricity capacity shortage of ~1000MWp”.  Empowerment Solar will help bring not just electrical, but economic power to Palestinian communities. </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Empowerment Solar is a significant undertaking, in one of the most volatile areas in the world.  This is not an effort we are taking on lightly, so we have diligently worked to reduce risks in our business model, and are building a solid team of capable Americans and Palestinians. </p>
