<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The story comes from Hyper Nova Studios (HNS), the heart and soul of Alec Jiu. Alec has written multiple stories for HNS in the past, including several of the older versions of Death Horizon and the much more recent fan film, 95th Annual Hunger Games. In addition to creating those short films over several days of hard work, HNS has also successfully produced several videos that were filmed in one day's time. Keeping in mind that HNS has previously worked with only small crews and very basic equipment, it has still found a way to move forward and continue creating many beloved videos. After a bit of down time though, everyone behind HNS has chosen to step up their game and make a bigger story come to life.</span></p>
<p>It's been 6 years since the original script was completed and since then, Death Horizon has seen many changes. Now Hyper Nova Studios wants to step up their game. Enter Death Horizon, rewritten from the ground up to contain new, exciting action and a gripping story, while still maintaining some of the original plot points. The film takes place in a modern day Las Vegas, two months after a mysterious plague overtook the world. It's up to the characters to find their own way out of the city.</p>
<p>To us, this film is not only a new, fresh start, but it is a stepping stone for many more projects to come. We are a relatively small crew, running with starting level equipment, and introducing a cast of completely new actors. And yet, a successful campaign would not only help us make the film as a whole better, but also improve the film studio exponentially. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Funding Time</h3> <p>So when we think of funding for TV shows, movies, or even web series, we think big. Multi-million dollar projects. While these are all different, their funding all goes to the same relative things.</p>
<p>We aren't asking for anything close to those big-budget projects, simply enough to make a polished film that people can enjoy and share with friends. Simply put, $2,000 should allow us to get the project moving. Where exactly is your money going though? The $2,000 is going to be used for getting better camera equipment, costuming all of the characters to fit the world, and getting props to better dress the sets we will be working in.</p>
<p>Want to get a little more specific?</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Equipment: We're talking microphones to pick up crisp clean dialogue, lights to see whats going on, batteries to avoid wasted time during recharging periods, and a very important one, a tumble mat so we can accomplish some awesome looking stunts without expensive hospital bills as a result.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Costuming: Let's just say, having everyone costume themselves is a bit too...loose. We end up with everyone wearing things that don't exactly fit the story. So, we are looking at getting some nice outfits to fit the </span>apocalyptic<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> world. </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Props: Death Horizon revolves around action and we need guns... a lot of them. So, the best bet is Airsoft, and while they do look and feel like the real thing...they aren't cheap (especially for really nice ones). Although a big portion of the prop budget will go to weapon props, it is not the only thing we will be getting. The story will also call for a few props to dress up the vehicles, people, and scenery. All in all, the prop budget will be the smallest part of the film.</span></p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Campaign</h3> <p>This project's life will be dependent on the funding raised by the community. Without the funding, the film will be difficult to complete.

Contributing will help raise the quality standard for the film and could make it better than we ever expected!</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">While we have never attempted a project of this scale, we have completed a smaller 3 day shoot, keeping in mind that it was a non-stop shoot for all three days.The budget for that project was around $500-$600 and was funded mostly by the people working on it. However, we have gained much more experience and are now comfortable to take on a project much larger and deliver something many people could find enjoyment in. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">At the point of writing this campaign, we have already raised awareness for the project with people we have previously worked with and we will continue to do our best to get the word out, but having some extra help never hurts! In addition, we have the camera crew and a large percentage of the talent already lined up and ready to work. All we need now is the funding to make it all come together.</span></p>

</div><div> <p>Number one is quite simply...funding. That's why we are here running this campaign. We can always get things done without the funding, but that will slow production and immensely cut down the quality.</p>

<p>Copyright is another huge factor that has to be taken into account.

As we work on this project we’ll examine popular current 3D engines like Unity or the Unreal engine, and look to Support VR on the plethora of new HMD’s that are arriving. As the project moves forward, we expect 360VR video and WebGL to also play a larger part in presenting content in the Mediaverse. Of course, legacy platforms like Personal Computers, Mobile Phones and Tablets are all targets for delivery as well. If anything, over the years, we’ve learned that the best experiences come from the match of scope and content too the platforms used.

It’s an ever expanding VR structure that “lives” in Cyberspace, that's composed of a central entrance atrium core, that opens up and links to 12 or more POP Culture Media Spheres that encompass the history of the different Genres that have made our Fandom culture for over 60 years.It’s the Fandoms you love:The preliminary Genres of fandom we look to build contain experiences, exhibits and stories about the worlds, the characters, the universes that we all love. How will we choose which ones get priority to create? Well. we have a plan for that, and it includes YOU!  More on that later, for now, here is the list of where we think we’re headed, which Genres we'll focus on.The 12 CyberSpheres Planned:1. Comic Book Culture2. Horror and Monsters3. Science Fiction and Fantasy4. Toys and Games5. Pop Music6. Food and Fashion7. Technology8.  Art and Photography9. Comedy and Humor10. Advertising 11. Design + Architecture12. Animation and AnimeThese 12 Worlds will include the inside stories and history of TV shows, the Movies, the Songs, the Actors, the Artists, and the Things that gave our culture  it’s media identity for over 60 years.It’s the History you Lived:An Edutainment Environment, the Mediaverse MuseuCON will focus not on the “fictional narratives of the content you know” but on the unknown stories of it’s Creators.The Artists and Artisans who created the TV. the Music, the FILM. and the Narratives of the last 60 years.The Mediaverse will take a layered approach to learning about the media that has shaped us all. The worlds environment will be fun and entertaining, but the information and true stories contained within the exhibits will provide us all with the realities behind the virtualities of the media we all grew up in.Each Zone will be Hosted and Curated by an Expert in that Genre from our Core Mediaverse Team. They will help decide with your help hopefully how content is displayed and chosen. What events take place, what contests might happen, and how your thoughts and ideas can be added to the Mediaverse so that it reflects both the creators and viewser's contributions.In the future we want to hold virtual meet ups, grow them into VR conventions. and eventually hold large global fandom events. Offer schools to have VR Class trips. And eventually allow members to build and have VR Club Houses within the Genre zones and cyberspheres. It’s a lot to think about and to do. But we think we can make it start NOW.We think the time is right to begin to build this VR place on the Internet. A VR Portal to all things Fandom. New 360 cameras and HMD's are all getting produced for direct consumer markets in 2015. This means everyone can visit and contribute to this VR world. For years Cube3 had been creating digital projects that were ahead of their time, but now, the Mediaverse has caught up, and now's the time to build the future on our past.The Project Plan :We plan to take a modular approach to building and designing the Mediaverse MuseuCON..The first crowdfunding success will be targeted to preliminary design, gathering of curated content, team building and a limited VR environment to explore and meet up at in Virtual Reality.If we pass certain milestones, we will increase our production and scope to build out the Mediaverse quicker and with more and more of Fandoms wants. Should we build a Dr. Who Tribute World first?, or a Star Wars Zone? Maybe a Zone dedicated to Female Characters and their Creators in Science Fiction and Fantasy? Should we create a Punk Rock Club that celebrates places like CBGB's that are no longer with us? What about a Full Sized Godzilla? You tell US.  Join the Indiegogo and Vote!The First VR Space to be Designed and Produced from this  first stage crowdfunder would be the Central Entrance Core, which would offer a VR meeting place for all visitors and fans/members.  It’s design and existence will provide a taste of the entire Mediaverse MuseuCON to come. It also will serve as a VR meeting space to all members to discuss and learn about the Mediaverse's construction.After the Central Core is built, we’d focus on the Science Fiction or Horror Genre Zones most likely due to our teams current expertise and what we all would think would be  Fandom's  desire first.. But, we want you, contributing fan members, to help decide each other sections order of construction and focus and we want to make that part of the funding plan.What Platforms will Support it, How will it be built ?Cube3 has been working with virtual reality and real time 3D for over 25 years. Over that time there have been many platforms and tools that have come and gone. What stay’s is the “3D Designs and Content Built ”  For that , we’ll use long time professional tools from companies like Autodesk and Adobe. As we work on this project we’ll examine popular current 3D engines like Unity or the Unreal engine, and look to Support VR on the plethora of new HMD’s that are arriving. As the project moves forward, we expect 360VR video and WebGL to also play a larger part in presenting content in the Mediaverse. Of course, legacy platforms like Personal Computers, Mobile Phones and Tablets are all targets for delivery as well. If anything, over the years, we’ve learned that the best experiences come from the match of scope and content too the platforms used. Whichever 3D engine we finally use , or multiple techs we use will all depend on what’s ”the best thing” as we release and grow the Mediaverse. Our goal is to make a VR world that’s easy for all to use, accessible to all, and most of all, fun and entertaining to experience and learn in.How can I Help? YOU , the “Viewser” of the Mediaverse. We need YOU. This type of project can’t be done by anyone else but YOU. No one Company owns the culture, Not one cultural foundation of the past is ready to build this type of experience yet. But  with crowdfunding, you and a dedicated team of designers and developers can make this happen.We plan to build the perks into funding that reflects your interest in the POP Culture things you love. This crowdfunder on Indiegogo is the first step. Please join us. Contribute and choose a level and check out the Perks.We already own the URL Mediaverse.net and it will serve as the web portal to the Project and VR World. We have the tools to build all the 3D Worlds. The experience of over 25 years doing precisely these type of projects, AND we are Media Crazy People to boot.

<h3>Short Summary: </h3>
<p>A struggling, neurotic, desperately-needs-a-therapist screenwriter living with his cougar mother in Brooklyn, David Mars hasn’t written anything worth mentioning in years. To cope with his lackluster, woefully celibate, frustratingly timid lifestyle, he writes an episodic diary; television content reflecting his every day life.</p>
<p>Pitch after pitch, David can’t seem to sell a screenplay. But when an up-and-coming agent gets a hold of his real material, the aforementioned “Life On Mars,” David must reveal his <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/life-on-mars/edit/#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">private<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> and humiliating shortcomings with the world, in the form of a television show.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Why We Need The Funds:</h3>
<p>Funds for this project will go towards paying for a variety of expenses that include:</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>Every production has its challenges, but we are so dedicated in this script that we are certain we will overcome every obstacle we are faced with. </p>

This will be our very first film that we are writing, producing and editing. We have no doubt that we will recruit a great production team that will help make our dream a reality.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary: 
A struggling, neurotic, desperately-needs-a-therapist screenwriter living with his cougar mother in Brooklyn, David Mars hasn’t written anything worth mentioning in years. To cope with his lackluster, woefully celibate, frustratingly timid lifestyle, he writes an episodic diary; television content reflecting his every day life.
Pitch after pitch, David can’t seem to sell a screenplay. But when an up-and-coming agent gets a hold of his real material, the aforementioned “Life On Mars,” David must reveal his private and humiliating shortcomings with the world, in the form of a television show.

Why We Need The Funds:
Funds for this project will go towards paying for a variety of expenses that include:
Locations
Permits
Food
Transportation
Camera Equipment
Props
Costumes
And more


Risks & Challenges:
Every production has its challenges, but we are so dedicated in this script that we are certain we will overcome every obstacle we are faced with. 
At the University of Miami, we are not given the funds to produce a project. This will be our very first film that we are writing, producing and editing. We have no doubt that we will recruit a great production team that will help make our dream a reality.

<p></p>
<p>It’s an eerie concept, isn’t it? That, in it’s most simplified form, is the premise of my film “<b>Wavelength</b>”. </p>
<h4>[<a href=""http://wavelengthmovie.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wavelength Mood Board</a>]</h4>
<p>Wavelength is a short Surreal Horror film about a girl who has <i>just that</i> happen to her. She begins to investigate to find out who would have done this and why, but the deeper she questions the matter, the stranger and more difficult the answers become. Is she losing her mind? Is someone trying to hide something?</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431300358/tot8szs6fuh4uffa20uc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As a surreal horror, the film exudes an enigmatic spookiness, forgoing rationality for a focus on building a world, a tone within the film that creates unease and tension. ""Wavelength"" is a mysterious and ominous world of oppressive power, droning synths, a crackling psychic energy through which a disturbing puzzle is formed in the viewers minds. This is not a typical horror movie. Something is terribly wrong, but like our main character, you are desperately trying to find out what it is.</p>
<p></p>In a more personal sense, this film is important to me. I've been working on it for over two years now, in an effort to get absolutely everything right. I want this film to take my last film, Blotter, and blow it out of the water in terms of story, cinematics, sound, and overall value. My skills, experience, knowledge, and audience has expanded so vastly that I feel the need to create something that will reflect that. </div><div>I want to make something that will advance me even further, to help get my career as a professional filmmaker going in the most powerful way possible.</div><div>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I strongly believe that the landscape of film is changing. In an age of instant access to any film, song, image, or idea imaginable, Hollywood is losing money. Hollywood films are sticking to specific story formats, tried-and true franchises, remakes and reboots to put as much ""meat in the seats"" as possible, which contributes to a certain lack of originality.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the realm of the internet, artists have access to audiences that they never could have before, ways like Indiegogo, kickstarter, seed&amp;spark etc to find funding for their art without having to go to some producer, or compromise the vision in any way. With digital video technology progressing so exponentially and become more and more affordable I believe we can expect a booming Independent New Wave of Film arising from similar conditions not seen since the late 1960's, as well as a de-centralization of the filmmaking world.</p>
<p>In the larger sense, this film is my contribution to this independent new wave. I will participate in it through it's creation, but any artistic movement needs its patrons. You are the patrons, and you can evoke change.</p>
<p>And consider this: if this project goes well, you are assuring that many many more great things will come to you from me, this will help me get my feet on the ground running in a way that I had never had quite such an opportunity to before.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I funded my last project through Kickstarter and had great success, s<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">o why did I choose Indiegogo for Wavelength?</span></p>
<p>Making a movie is risky enough. On the final day of my fixed-funding campaign for ""Blotter"" I needed only $35 to reach my goal, or I would get nothing. Though I did make out fine in the end, the fear I felt of not reaching my goal was almost too much to handle.</p>
<p>The way I see it, I AM GOING TO MAKE WAVELENGTH NO MATTER WHAT, if I make fifty dollars or if I make fifty thousand dollars, it's going to happen! </p>
<p>But the more that I make, the clearer and more true the adaptation of my vision becomes. The more that is contributed, the better the final product I give back to you will turn out.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you cannot afford to donate even our $5 minimum contribution, but still want me to be able to make this movie, TOO BAD.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">So share it around on social media, direct your friends, family, coworkers and businesses here, surely at least one of them can afford to/want to help out. Help get the word out into the greater collective consciousness.</span></p>

    Risks & Challenges I funded my last project through Kickstarter and had great success, so why did I choose Indiegogo for Wavelength?
Making a movie is risky enough. On the final day of my fixed-funding campaign for ""Blotter"" I needed only $35 to reach my goal, or I would get nothing. Though I did make out fine in the end, the fear I felt of not reaching my goal was almost too much to handle.
The way I see it, I AM GOING TO MAKE WAVELENGTH NO MATTER WHAT, if I make fifty dollars or if I make fifty thousand dollars, it's going to happen! 
But the more that I make, the clearer and more true the adaptation of my vision becomes. The more that is contributed, the better the final product I give back to you will turn out.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot afford to donate even our $5 minimum contribution, but still want me to be able to make this movie, TOO BAD.
So share it around on social media, direct your friends, family, coworkers and businesses here, surely at least one of them can afford to/want to help out. Help get the word out into the greater collective consciousness.
EDIT: I've discovered that asking people to ""share"" provides the comfort of having helped, but the evidence shows that this, does not in fact help. You can spare five dollars. I know you can.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

a national, <i>independent </i>media forum that can freely tackle our major social,
economic, political, and environmental challenges. </p>
<p>It's time for a change!</p>
<p><b>That’s
why we are creating an independent, not-for-profit, alternative online media platform that focuses on Canadian issues and concerns.</b></p><p>In short, we are creating a new form of online video journalism!</p><p><b>OUR MISSION is to INFORM, EMPOWER and INSPIRE Everyday
Canadians.</b> </p><p>WHY DOES THIS MATTER TO YOU?</p><p></p><p>Our society faces daunting
challenges – accelerating poverty; economic inequality and instability; political
uncertainty; climate change; environmental devastation; social unrest; technological
transformations. Now, more than ever, we need access to innovative solutions. We
need to be informed about issues that are important to us. We need to be
engaged. But corporate-controlled media dictates the stories that are covered; how
issues and options are presented. Mainstream media shapes and controls our
worldview, and what we believe is possible.</p>
<p>We are offering an alternative. We
want to provide deeper insights into issues that really matter, but are often
ignored or only given “top down” media coverage. Our programs will give voice
to social innovators, activists, educators, frontline workers, champions of the
marginalized and excluded; community entrepreneurs…in other words, those who
are knowledgeable, experienced and passionate about finding creative and just solutions. </p><p>WHY DO WE WANT TO DO THIS? So you can have a better understanding of important issues and what is really going on behind the scenes. So you can be inspired to become more actively involved. So you can be empowered to make more informed choices.</p><p>HOW WILL WE DO THIS?</p><p>Through our informative and engaging videos we will:</p><p>- Provide well-researched <b>information </b>on important issues;</p><p>- Present <b>alternative</b> perspectives and solutions;</p><p>- Showcase innovative<b> </b>leaders,<b> activists </b>and change-makers;</p><p>- Stimulate discussion, social activism and <b>community engagement.</b></p><p>We want to give you and your concerns a voice, and</p><p>
</p><p></p>
<p><b><span>WE NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN!</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>With
your help, we can create dynamic, informative, thought-provoking, and sometimes humorous</span><span> </span><span>videos designed to engage the Canadian public. </span></p>

</div></div>","MEDIA RE-IMAGINED, AND WHY THIS MATTERS:Almost all Canadian media is owned by large corporations, with their own agendas and interests. Canada lacks
a national, independent media forum that can freely tackle our major social,
economic, political, and environmental challenges. 
It's time for a change!
That’s
why we are creating an independent, not-for-profit, alternative online media platform that focuses on Canadian issues and concerns.In short, we are creating a new form of online video journalism!OUR MISSION is to INFORM, EMPOWER and INSPIRE Everyday
Canadians. WHY DOES THIS MATTER TO YOU?Our society faces daunting
challenges – accelerating poverty; economic inequality and instability; political
uncertainty; climate change; environmental devastation; social unrest; technological
transformations. Now, more than ever, we need access to innovative solutions. We
need to be informed about issues that are important to us. We need to be
engaged. But corporate-controlled media dictates the stories that are covered; how
issues and options are presented. Mainstream media shapes and controls our
worldview, and what we believe is possible.
We are offering an alternative. We
want to provide deeper insights into issues that really matter, but are often
ignored or only given “top down” media coverage. Our programs will give voice
to social innovators, activists, educators, frontline workers, champions of the
marginalized and excluded; community entrepreneurs…in other words, those who
are knowledgeable, experienced and passionate about finding creative and just solutions. WHY DO WE WANT TO DO THIS? So you can have a better understanding of important issues and what is really going on behind the scenes. So you can be inspired to become more actively involved. So you can be empowered to make more informed choices.HOW WILL WE DO THIS?Through our informative and engaging videos we will:- Provide well-researched information on important issues;- Present alternative perspectives and solutions;- Showcase innovative leaders, activists and change-makers;- Stimulate discussion, social activism and community engagement.We want to give you and your concerns a voice, and

WE NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN!

With
your help, we can create dynamic, informative, thought-provoking, and sometimes humorous videos designed to engage the Canadian public. 
Our
programs will spotlight local, regional and
national issues and people, and will be broadcast on our website and on social media.""CANADA 101"" SERIES:""SOCIAL CHANGE-MAKERS"" SERIES:WHO WE ARE:

The first season will primarily focus on the new relationships between nature and humans while retelling history through comedic satirical sketches and advertisements. Many of the guests featured on the show are from various decades in popular history, visiting the set by way of a time machine. Angela Davis, Sacajawea, The Boogey Man, and Coopernicus are some characters featured for the upcoming season. Characters and advertisements are in collaboration with people, services, groups, and businesses in the NYC community. Those looking to participate can contact the show via our Email, Facebook and Instagram. What We Need:The Set:The show will require significant set design, including props such as a simulated time machine portal for our time traveling guests and skits. Additionally, much of the show is done using self-designed backdrops as well as a green screen for still and moving images.Puppets & Costumes:Constructed by fashion designer Sarah Lawrence of Grave X SL, puppet and wardrobe design for visiting decade-specific characters is a big part of the performance. Graphics and Animation:Each episode plays with animation and graphic design in a different way. To make our world really come alive we've incorporated the special help of graphic designer Emalis Robateau. Performance:Each episode will conclude with a performance from varying talents, we want to make sure we can provide any additional props or set alterations to accommodate different performance mediums.Getting It Online:The majority of the editing process will require the assistance of a Special Effects editor. Our show is prop and costume heavy creating a completely surreal experience for our viewers, and it's going to mean lots of help from many hands.Rainy Days:We will also have funds aside for any production emergencies such as equipment rentals, studio space reservations, transportation, and maintenance. Production:Season 1 will be comprised of four episodes and a special Finale, that will air by January 2016. Production for the first season will begin early November 2015. During the months of November and December production will take place every other week. With that, the set props and simulated time machine will be designed and built, costumes for characters will be created by the episode and additional puppets will be added to the show. Editing will primarily take place weeks not dedicated to production, in order to release Season 1 online at once by January 2016.Things to Consider...In order to create our ideal future world, The Indigo Show TV will require significant set design, special effects, puppet repair and a reliable studio space for filming. Additionally we intend to cover all bases by creating an emergency fund for standard production challenges such as transportation, equipment rentals, and any issues brought up by inclement weather or alternative studio space.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/>In 2012, we began our researches on street art. We tried to contact some Iranian street artists whose identities were unknown and gradually we found out that this form of art presents many dangers for the artists involved. Because of high censorship on freedom of expression and art, street artists know that street art is the only way to express their believes. As they don’t need government’s permission to their art on walls. The government has got this art wrong and considers it as promoting satanism and slogans against the government and imprisons the street artists or even death penalty for satanism is waiting for the artists. So we took a serious decision to make this film. by making this film we want to change the look of street art and pave the way for street artists.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439137397/punvjxfsg9hnbqh7cssw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>This documentary film is a result of three years of research and shooting videos about culture incidents in Iran. <br/>We took all the necessary steps to make this film respectable and appealing to the audience even if we know that after we will finish this project our freedom is threatened. With all the risks we do strongly believe that a change is possible in the anti-cultural perspective of the government and the younger generation of Iran will benefit from it as well the Iranian street art. <br/>Unfortunately, three subjects of this documentary film have had emigrated from Iran and we do not have access to their art anymore. These street artists left Iran forever, because of many problems that they faced in their work and due to fear of arrest and imprisonment. Now we have a heavy burden on our shoulders feeling obligated to change the government’s look at the art. Unfortunately, due to financial problems, this project still has not come to fruition. we are responsible to prevent other artists to be forced to escape from Iran and by finishing this documentary film we hope to reduce the liability and this is possible only with your great help and support.</p>

As they don’t need government’s permission to their art on walls. The government has got this art wrong and considers it as promoting satanism and slogans against the government and imprisons the street artists or even death penalty for satanism is waiting for the artists. So we took a serious decision to make this film. by making this film we want to change the look of street art and pave the way for street artists.
First thing will be to sign an international distribution contract so the film will have worldwide screenings. It is also important to us to have lots of screenings in U.S.A .

Risks and challenges
This documentary film is a result of three years of research and shooting videos about culture incidents in Iran. We took all the necessary steps to make this film respectable and appealing to the audience even if we know that after we will finish this project our freedom is threatened. With all the risks we do strongly believe that a change is possible in the anti-cultural perspective of the government and the younger generation of Iran will benefit from it as well the Iranian street art. Unfortunately, three subjects of this documentary film have had emigrated from Iran and we do not have access to their art anymore. These street artists left Iran forever, because of many problems that they faced in their work and due to fear of arrest and imprisonment. Now we have a heavy burden on our shoulders feeling obligated to change the government’s look at the art. Unfortunately, due to financial problems, this project still has not come to fruition. we are responsible to prevent other artists to be forced to escape from Iran and by finishing this documentary film we hope to reduce the liability and this is possible only with your great help and support.

<p>As-salamu alaykum my dear brothers and sisters,</p>
<p>Islam has been in Saint Lucia since the ‘90s and has been growing at quite a rapid pace. We've been struggling to make ends within our current facility. The location cannot properly hold our congregation as most members have to sit outside during Jummah prayers. The heat outside can be so intense that one of our brothers actually suffered a near-heat stroke waiting to listen to the Khutbah outside.</p>

Our facility not only caters to Muslims but to all those that are in need of aid. It provides a shelter for all those in need of it. In order to compensate for the growing local population becoming more aware of Islam, we need to upgrade our food storage and kitchen areas. At present, we only have a single faucet, no bathroom, no air conditioning, broken ceiling tiles, no proper divider between the sexes, and no windows in the current musallah facility and, <i>Inshallah</i>, are looking to build these areas in the creation of the new mosque.</p>

<p>We have 3–5 new converts every month in Saint Lucia, and when you compare that to the entire population of 170,000 people, that's a whole lot of people finding light in Islam. As such, we can't contain the new members of the congregation within such a small facility. According to Prof. Ilyas Ba Yunus, 75 percent of converts to Islam convert back to their original faiths after a period of time.This tends to be due to lack of support from the community around them and the hardships of properly adapting. With a more established Masjid and full-time Imam, we can ease the transitions for the many converts who come within our halls.</p>

<p>The brothers and sisters here have reverted with the help of sources such as visiting Imams, senior members of the congregation, and Muslims from the American medical schools located here. The people of our congregation need a real learned Hafiz and Imam - an educator of Islam - to inform them of what is right and what is wrong according to proper fiqh and schooling.</p>
<p>With your assistance,we can guide and ease these people into the correct path of Islam and the appropriate way to live up to the Prophet's Sunnah. The hiring of an Imam is a much needed task to be accomplished, and the ilm/knowledge he will provide will help our congregation grow that much wiser, stronger, and unified. Some of the members of the congregation lack the proper vocalization of the Qur'an and will improperly recite it, skewering and misinterpreting the language of the Holy Book. With the assistance of an Imam we can host legitimate <i>Arabic classes</i> as well, which would allow for proper clarity. A large majority of our congregation is eager to see these classes come to actualization. With your funding, we can make these aspirations a reality.</p>
<p>The youth of the island also tend to partake in more reckless activities as the drug scene is rather widespread throughout the island. <i>Establishing a Sunday School </i>and a place where youth can gather would be a great way to avert them from dangerous behaviors. With the current musallah, this cannot happen, as the current location is farther away from the local schools and the max capacity for the building is quite small.

<p>The proposed property is in the city center just off the main street and it's visible and accessible to all along the main road. (It’s centrally located, next to the post office.)

The protection and well being it will provide will be priceless.

</div></div>","Hello Indiegogos!

We are José André Sibaja and Ibai Vigil-Escalera, two independent filmmakers, that have been collaborating to make short films. 






Moving to New York and the love for the film brought us together. We found ourselves in a city full of immigrants through an eclectic mixture of cultures. People looking for new beginnings, and in a lot of cases, escaping from countries oppressed by their governments, society or religion. We were curious to find that most of us experienced this in so many ways, no matter where we came from. After hearing others story’s we had the urge to write Legacy. 

Legacy is a short film that speaks about New Babylon, a country oppressed under the dictatorship of Saduj Dormin, who is on the verge of death and fears losing power. In her years of leadership, she battled the sin of greed in human beings, and condemned the country to ruin.

Legacy is a coral piece driven only by female characters. We intend to portrayed how the women from New Babylon survive in times of misery.















We are going for a Surrealist Atmosphere, with the goal of creating a dark and deteriorated world, where its occupants live in hostility and agony. Animal instinct rules in this extreme environment. 
We found inspiration in German Expressionism to create a theatrical film shot in black and white. It references films such as The Cabinet of the Dr. Caligari (1919) The Holy Mountain (1973), The Cook, the Thief, his Wife and her Lover (1989), Titus (1999) and Dogville (2003).
 
    





Director, José André Sibaja. San Jose, Costa Rica. 1992.
As early as I can remember, I have been artistically aroused by decadent women in comics, films, books, and life. They were survivors, characters that no matter their origin felt alone in the world. Nowadays, as a filmmaker, I’m constantly trying to tell stories that portrays characters who suffer from the dark path of marginalization and ostracism. I have learned to admire their survival capabilities in a world that rejects them.

Director Photography, Ibai Vigil-Escalera. Zarautz, Spain. 1988. 
I first came into contact with photography as everyone does... childhood family albums. Moments frozen in time, of who we were, where we have been, those lost and those gained, which if it weren’t for photography, would be lost entirely to the inevitable decay of our memories. I view photography as documentation of the human condition. 






To make this film happen we would need $ 15,000! We would cover production expenses such as Set construction, since we intend to build every set from scratch to create a dreamlike world.

</div></div>","Short Summary

 SAFE is a suspense thriller that follows a young couple who move to a new town, only to find that not only can't they run from their troubles, but a whole new set of demons awaits them in their new home.  










The film follows a young married couple, Norah and Zeke Mayfield, who are struggling to have a baby after being victimized in their hometown. Seeking to get a fresh start, they move across the country into a quiet, suburban neighborhood where Norah instantly falls in love with their new home. But shortly after they move into the house, red flags begin popping up. 
Zeke discovers a locked drawer in the garage. When he goes through the house keys to unlock it, he realizes that every key he tries is the exact same key; the key to the front door. All of the other keys to their house are unaccounted for. Then their slightly creepy and way too forthcoming neighbor Dan, tells the couple that the previous owner packed up her kids and fled the home in the middle of the night without warning. But he says, ""Other than that, nothing exciting goes on."" 
Norah remains committed to settling in and establishing a sense of security. She claims there's nothing unusual about the keys or the former owner. Unfortunately, Norah soon finds out she can't escape her unconscious mind and starts to question if the sounds she's heard while alone in the house; footsteps on the gravel, a key unlocking the side entrance door, are real or just paranoia. Norah's situation escalates when she receives an unnerving phone call from a detective in her hometown. The fear she was running away from, grips ahold of her once more. Not wanting to alarm Zeke at work, she calls her sister Sara, who flies out to stay with the couple for a few days. 
What Norah, Zeke and Sara don't know is they are about to be in the greatest fight of their life when a terrifying intruder knocks on the front door. 




ABOUT REEL ARTISTS COLLECTIVE
We are a group of passionate, industry professionals who want to change the way people watch movies. Our goal is to create amazing movies through inspired artistic collaboration, outside the Hollywood studio system, that can be distributed globally online. 
Our suspenseful, thriller ""Safe"", featuring celebrity Alison Arngrim (Little House on the Prairie), is the start of that dream.

Going outside the studio system has risks and rewards. By helping to fund this project, you are allowing creative filmmaking and new media distribution to be the main focus of this movie, NOT a studio's bottom line. 
Imagine this, you pick up your cell phone and find our film in the palm of your hand, anywhere with an internet connection. And what's even more cool is that when the end credits roll around, as a funder, you will SEE YOUR NAME scroll on the screen!
 As technology advances, so does movie making and movie watching. Help us create the new media entertainment revolution.
   What We Need & What You Get 
Incredible advances in film technology have made making a great looking movie easier than ever before but in order to make a high quality, independent film we still need to cover some remaining production expenses. We have a goal of $20,000 which will go towards paying our professional film crew such as our director of photography to give our film a unique and captivating style, a professional sound person so you don't miss a word or scary sound, to help cover the costs of our amazing talent, as well as insurance, equipment, and rentals. A prop knife that looks amazing on film doesn't come cheap and we want to give you the most suspenseful, intense and entertaining movie possible.



Thankfully the good folks at Indiegogo have made funding a movie, fun. Check out some  of our very cool perks like a visit to the set, digital downloads of the movie, autographed memorabilia and much more! 
Plus, we are giving everyone who funds this movie regardless of level, a special thanks in the closing section of the film's credits because without you, there would be no movies.






    Risks & Challenges 
Making a movie really does take a village. There are contracts to negotiate, various personalities to contend with, permits to be gotten, never enough bathrooms and only so much daylight to get the perfect shot.
We at Reel Artists Collective, pride ourselves on being an artists collective. We believe we are better together than apart.

Hopefully you've seen our campaign video at the top of the page where you can see our concept footage we shot to give people an idea of what the tone and style our short will be. A big thank you to the actors Nicholas Finlayson and Brian Beatty for helping us make the concept footage! </p>
<p>Now for some info on us and our project. Zach, Brandon, and I (Mitchell) are great friends and have been working on films together since we were in high school. As we got older, our films got better and more mature. We believe we are ready to take it to the next step with this project. Titled ""Water"", this will be our most ambitious project to date and we can't be more excited about it!</p>
<p>""Water"" is a short film that takes place in a time when water is incredibly scarce and follows four men as they find themselves struggling to survive. But it's more than just a simple story of survival. The short will deal with themes of life and death, fate and choices. Do our decisions matter, or is everything predetermined? This is the question our film will explore.</p>
<p>This project will mark the first time we'll have a budget for a film. In the past, we've done everything guerrilla style. We want ""Water"" to be different. We want to tell the story properly, and in order for that to happen we need help funding the film. That's where you all come in!</p>
<p>By helping us fund this movie, you are allowing us to bring this story to life. The ability to turn an idea into a living, breathing, tangible work of art.

</div><div> <p>Along the way, as with any film, we will encounter obstacles. A major challenge for us will be scheduling.

</div></div>","Short Summary Thank you for taking the time to look at our campaign! Hopefully you've seen our campaign video at the top of the page where you can see our concept footage we shot to give people an idea of what the tone and style our short will be. A big thank you to the actors Nicholas Finlayson and Brian Beatty for helping us make the concept footage! 
Now for some info on us and our project. Zach, Brandon, and I (Mitchell) are great friends and have been working on films together since we were in high school. As we got older, our films got better and more mature. We believe we are ready to take it to the next step with this project. Titled ""Water"", this will be our most ambitious project to date and we can't be more excited about it!
""Water"" is a short film that takes place in a time when water is incredibly scarce and follows four men as they find themselves struggling to survive. But it's more than just a simple story of survival. The short will deal with themes of life and death, fate and choices. Do our decisions matter, or is everything predetermined? This is the question our film will explore.
This project will mark the first time we'll have a budget for a film. In the past, we've done everything guerrilla style. We want ""Water"" to be different. We want to tell the story properly, and in order for that to happen we need help funding the film. That's where you all come in!
By helping us fund this movie, you are allowing us to bring this story to life. The ability to turn an idea into a living, breathing, tangible work of art. That's the beauty of film, people coming together to make something out of nothing. We are extremely passionate about what we do. This is our love. We can assure you that we will do our best to bring you something special.   What We Need & What You Get We would love to raise $5,000 to cover the costs of:
• Equipment (Cameras, lenses, etc.)• Props• Hair, Makeup, and Costumes• Sets and Locations• Food for Actors and Crew• Compensation for Actors and Crew
Should we not reach our entire goal of $5,000, we will distribute the funds where they are needed most and ensure that the finished product will still be of quality.
No donation is too small! Every dollar counts and will help us tell the story the best way we can.

<div>When <a href=""www.quarksamericanbento.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Quarks</a> was first in its conception stages, it started at home. It was a fun dinner idea, a delightful little date night in which vegetables were chopped and meats were grilled and fun was had. It started in a kitchen, the same one where little ones scrambled for juice and Thanksgiving dinner has been cooked for years. Right on the very countertops that host late night sandwiches and home made deliciousness. </div>
<div>And then it happened--a <i>real </i>building, a <i>real</i> kitchen, a <i>real </i>staff. A <i>real </i>restaurant. <i><a href=""www.quarksamericanbento.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Quarks American Bento</a> </i>located at 125 5th Ave S St.Cloud MN.</div>
<div>In this day and age, people believe it's ridiculous to go into business. They scoff, and they talk about how difficult it is to start up. They say there's too much out there, it's all been done before. They say it's impossible to reach people, to get the masses excited about something new. Nothing is new, they'll say. The American Dream as we once knew it is dead, </div>
<div>We beg to differ.</div>
<div>What does it take to keep the dream alive? Well, it takes a few things. It takes <i>an idea to be proud of</i>, one to hold on to when times get tough (because they will, they will <i>always </i>get tough.) It takes <i>motivation </i>to keep getting out of bed every morning and work tirelessly through the day, only to drop into bed and do it all again. It takes a team of hard working and loyal people--friends and family and strangers alike, to put all the blocks together until the empty building turns into something bigger, something grander. Most important, it takes a village. A strong community who sees their peers and wants to raise them up, to help them build themselves up and up and up until they can go no higher, and raises them higher still.</div>

</p><h2><b>What is Trilhando
Caminho?</b></h2>
<p>  Trilhando
Caminho is a space that’s purpose is to empower girls of an impoverished
community past the cyclical behaviors of drug abuse and domestic violence,
instilling self-worth and confidence within them so that they can broaden their
opportunities in a world that is constantly attempting to tell them they can’t
because they are girls. </p>
<p>  The program
recruits girls from Trilho, a favela, or slum, of Fortaleza to play soccer
twice a week after school, instead of hanging on the street where they are susceptible
to behaviors such as alcoholism, domestic abuse, and sexual tourism. This haven
provides girls with the opportunity to choose a different, more positive, and
empowering life path. </p>
<p>  For six
weeks, the program focused strictly on soccer practice, demonstrating the
logistics of the game. The focus has now begun to shift on the beauty of the
game and how being strong provides a way to achieve goals. With a small push of
financial help, Trilhando Caminho can flourish, and provide a path of
empowerment to so many girls of the favela community of Trilho. </p>
<h2><b>Why Should You
Donate?</b></h2>
<p>  The
financial state of the community of Trilho does not allow room for funding a
program such as Trilhando Caminho. If funding can be increased, further
activities such as inspiring speakers and team outings can be implemented so as
to increase the overall self-esteem, female empowerment, and educational
development of the girls of Trilho. </p>
<p>  Trilhando
Caminho is currently using one well-worn ball, and playing barefoot, as most of
the girls do not have shoes that are suitable to play soccer in. While the team
has determined a name Estrelas F.C. (Stars Football Club), uniforms must be put
on hold, as there is no means to pay for them. There is huge potential for this
project and an immense need for it to be implemented. By donating to this cause, you not only help the girls continue playing soccer and learning from speakers about ways to escape the cycle of poverty, you also will make a massive impact on the whole of the community. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A portion of the funds donated will go to the community center, where access to water is little, and resources for night classes and meetings are very limited.</span></p>
<p>  Girls
living in favelas, the slums of Brazil, face subjugation in their everyday
lives believing they won’t amount to anything due to their living and financial
constraints. By donating to this cause you are not only helping a group of
girls play soccer, but you are assisting in the empowerment of a subjugated
population of our world, young, impoverished women. In doing so, you can
contribute to the betterment of each of these girls’ lives, offering them the
joy of soccer and the idea that their state of being and living situation
should not inhibit their dreams. Help the stars of Trilhando Caminho strive! </p>
<h2><b>Who am I?</b></h2>
<p>  While
studying abroad in Fortaleza, I was given the opportunity to research the
beginnings of Trilhando Caminho, and show how soccer can be beneficial to
increasing female empowerment worldwide. Although I am no longer in Brazil, the
program is still in my heart and still needs assistance. By creating a space to
spread the word about the subjugation of these young women, and how soccer has
been and continues to be so influential to them, I hope to pass on the message
that we can make big change in this world with little bouts of aid.</p>
<p>  If you are
unable to make a donation, please help get the word out. This is a small
population in our big world, but this program can make a huge difference! </p><p><br/></p><p>If you are interested in hearing about the further successes of this group of girls, I will be sending out a newsletter, with updated pictures, biographies, and stories about the team's endeavors! </p>

  Girls
living in favelas, the slums of Brazil, face subjugation in their everyday
lives believing they won’t amount to anything due to their living and financial
constraints. By donating to this cause you are not only helping a group of
girls play soccer, but you are assisting in the empowerment of a subjugated
population of our world, young, impoverished women. In doing so, you can
contribute to the betterment of each of these girls’ lives, offering them the
joy of soccer and the idea that their state of being and living situation
should not inhibit their dreams. Help the stars of Trilhando Caminho strive! 
Who am I?
  While
studying abroad in Fortaleza, I was given the opportunity to research the
beginnings of Trilhando Caminho, and show how soccer can be beneficial to
increasing female empowerment worldwide. Although I am no longer in Brazil, the
program is still in my heart and still needs assistance. By creating a space to
spread the word about the subjugation of these young women, and how soccer has
been and continues to be so influential to them, I hope to pass on the message
that we can make big change in this world with little bouts of aid.
  If you are
unable to make a donation, please help get the word out. This is a small
population in our big world, but this program can make a huge difference! If you are interested in hearing about the further successes of this group of girls, I will be sending out a newsletter, with updated pictures, biographies, and stories about the team's endeavors!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

    Story
CRYPTOMERIA follows the introspection of a man haunted by self-hatred.  Its influences span from filmmakers like Maya Deren, Ernie Gehr and David Lynch to surrealist artists like Max Ernst, Rene Magritte and Salvador Dali. 
Risks & Challenges We have three locations, one of which is a hotel room that we are physically building from the remnants of another set. It will be a challenge to make its aesthetic fit the mood of the film and find the proper materials to pragmatically configure this surreal world. 
The set is 10x14 feet and 8 feet tall, we are adding a door and a window and dressing it to look like a hotel room.

The theater we are hoping to film in is in Anaconda, MT. About and hour and a half away but well worth the drive. 

We are also exploring the medium of stop motion animation which will take lots of time and careful meticulous work. The costs are high as well as the consumption of time. However, the payout for proper execution is immense. 
A Note From Sam Lowe-Anker (Key Animator):
""We draw inspiration from Max Ernst's bird head drawings in ""Une semaine de bonté"", as well as  Ray Harryhausen's dinosaur and monster puppets in order to bring to life a truly convincing fictional character. Being constructed in the following images is a full human scale stop motion puppet of a man in a wheelchair with the head of a bird.

</p><p><b>The Story?</b><br/></p><p>Lawrence, a new age relationship expert, helps his clients
deal with relationship woes in a not so formal process. He conducts dream
therapy by inducing his clients under a dream-like state. He reveals their
self-conscious to them, and also reveals their spouse self-conscious, in order
for them to find the truth about their lover. However, things come to a halt
when Lawrence meets Dr. Lindin; a blind, set in her own formal ways,
Psychologist with a focus in marriage counseling. With the two bumping into each
other, an argument is sure to follow, with the opposite teachings from each
side. Dr. Lindin agrees to a scheduled session with Lawrence, and finds out
there is another method than what she is use to. Taking a live trip inside her
own self-conscious brings an eye opening experience, but chaos surely follows
when her husband self-conscious is probed. Dr. Lindin not only finds out who
her husband really is, but also finds herself in hot water when she is trapped
inside of his mind. A game of fantasy and real life is played to see if she can
awake from her comatose state. Will Lawrence be able to go in and save her from
this unfortunate chain of events, or lose his own mind in the process?</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443822374/ckxjubcj0uxrwgnaelep.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Where do I hail from?</b></p><p>I'm from Chicago, IL, attended school at Columbia College of Chicago. I have been writing for several years. I first wrote a relationship book entitled ""Love Or Lust""; how to find, acquire, and keep love. Soon after I wrote my first feature length screenplay. I placed in the top ten in a writer's lab at the Phoenix Film Festival. It was then I knew I had the ability to write. So 7 screenplays later here I land in Austin, TX.</p><p><b>So why am  asking for your money?</b></p><p>That is the most important question by far, why should you help me out?

But the truth of the matter is without being able to pay your workers, and not afford quality equipment, makes for a hectic shooting schedule. I found myself wearing 8 hat; workers wouldn't work as hard for no pay,  and sometimes I couldn't feed the cast &amp; crew. Let's talk about equipment, lack of cameras to capture the perfect angles, constant breakdown and setups to capture a single movement. By the end of the movie we had made so many mistakes that the story suffered tremendously. Money does make a difference: and with my type of work, I could seriously use it. I write nothing but full length movies, and with that I generate a large crew. So in order for my vision to manifest properly, I need support from the great people of the world.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443824398/ddnqcwj9e6gn5dbbjm58.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>   2. <i> Dreams sometime need the world's hope to fly.</i><p>Let me give you a little honest background from where I come from and my stance in this world. I'm not your everyday filmmaker out to make a quick buck or hustle the people. My, hopes, dreams, and lively hood is counting on this. I came from the urban neighborhoods of Chicago &amp; Gary, Indiana. My mother and father raised six children on low middle class income and never asked for a thing.

deal with relationship woes in a not so formal process. He conducts dream
therapy by inducing his clients under a dream-like state. He reveals their
self-conscious to them, and also reveals their spouse self-conscious, in order
for them to find the truth about their lover. However, things come to a halt
when Lawrence meets Dr. Lindin; a blind, set in her own formal ways,
Psychologist with a focus in marriage counseling. With the two bumping into each
other, an argument is sure to follow, with the opposite teachings from each
side. Dr. Lindin agrees to a scheduled session with Lawrence, and finds out
there is another method than what she is use to. Taking a live trip inside her
own self-conscious brings an eye opening experience, but chaos surely follows
when her husband self-conscious is probed. Dr. Lindin not only finds out who
her husband really is, but also finds herself in hot water when she is trapped
inside of his mind. A game of fantasy and real life is played to see if she can
awake from her comatose state. Will Lawrence be able to go in and save her from
this unfortunate chain of events, or lose his own mind in the process?Where do I hail from?I'm from Chicago, IL, attended school at Columbia College of Chicago. I have been writing for several years. I first wrote a relationship book entitled ""Love Or Lust""; how to find, acquire, and keep love. Soon after I wrote my first feature length screenplay. I placed in the top ten in a writer's lab at the Phoenix Film Festival. It was then I knew I had the ability to write. So 7 screenplays later here I land in Austin, TX.So why am  asking for your money?That is the most important question by far, why should you help me out? Well I think I have a couple good reasons why.Lack of funds can make for a horrendous movie.Listen I get it, I know you can do a movie with no money, I can attest to that myself. But the truth of the matter is without being able to pay your workers, and not afford quality equipment, makes for a hectic shooting schedule. I found myself wearing 8 hat; workers wouldn't work as hard for no pay,  and sometimes I couldn't feed the cast & crew. Let's talk about equipment, lack of cameras to capture the perfect angles, constant breakdown and setups to capture a single movement. By the end of the movie we had made so many mistakes that the story suffered tremendously. Money does make a difference: and with my type of work, I could seriously use it. I write nothing but full length movies, and with that I generate a large crew. So in order for my vision to manifest properly, I need support from the great people of the world.   2.  Dreams sometime need the world's hope to fly.Let me give you a little honest background from where I come from and my stance in this world. I'm not your everyday filmmaker out to make a quick buck or hustle the people. My, hopes, dreams, and lively hood is counting on this. I came from the urban neighborhoods of Chicago & Gary, Indiana. My mother and father raised six children on low middle class income and never asked for a thing. I would always dream that one day I'm going to make it and give them the life they deserve. So I would watch TV shows and dream; use cartoons to escape my harsh surroundings. And one day I thought I would get my chance to blossom and show the world that I was meant to be somebody. If I had money for my own equipment I could surely produce quality that would pave my way: but I only have the scripts, the vision, the talent. I need someone to supply that much needed help so I can get that chance to compete in this world of film. I thought that would have came with my first feature length movie ""The Godchildren"". But with no money at all and a lack of dedicated crew members, the movie did not come out like I expected. I learned that in order to really do this on  a big scale, I'm going to need big money. So I just launched 2 campaigns for my scripts to see if my dreams can take flight. But it can't happen if you don't give me a chance.This is not our first time around!You're not taking a chance on giving your money to some first-timers. We've been there before where we had to learn from our stumbles. We know how to take a hit and keep going. We have worked on countless projects that our shelved for the very same reason, no money to do it the right way. I guarantee you I will produce a film worth while, if you back this vision.Conclusion!So where do we go down this LoneRoad? Here and now, you and I lie in this gateway.

The University of Idaho Ice Hockey program is fundraising for the 2015-2016 season and we need your help.<br/></p>
<p>The University of Idaho Hockey team is a part of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) and is also a part of the Division II Independent Conference, soon making the jump to the Mountain West Collegiate Hockey League. The team was established in 1992 and is one of the oldest sports clubs at the University of Idaho. </p>
<p>Since we are not recognized as a Varsity sport by the University of Idaho we do not receive very much funding from the school. The primary source of income for the team is from the players themselves, but sometimes it still is not enough to afford playing in a competitive league <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">so here is your chance to get involved and become a Vandal Hockey supporter.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> If you would like to help push the Vandals to the playoffs and beyond, please help us reach our goal. We have some great incentives for everyone who decides to help. Thank you, and as always Go Vandals!</span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>-The Vandal Ice Hockey Family</p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Each year, the University of Idaho Hockey program budgets just under $35,000 to afford a successful season playing in the ACHA. That money covers program costs such as:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Travel/hotel/gas/food/etc.</li>
<li>Ice rentals (both practice &amp; games)</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Referee fees</span></li>
<li>ACHA league fees</li>
<li>USA Hockey Insurance fees</li>
<li>Gear</li>
<li>Equipment </li>
<li>Staff</li>
<li>And much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>But where does the $35,000 come from? As a start, we receive $10,000 from the University of Idaho to cover our basic costs, but that is just a dent. After that, each player pays $600 on top of tuition to participate in the University of Idaho Hockey program. With a 20 man roster, we've reached another $12,000 for our team totaling $22,000. The remaining $13,000 is left for the our program to fund raise over the course of the season which is where this site comes in.</p>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $5,000 dollars for the team to help off-set the costs of the University of Idaho Hockey program. </p>
<p>If you look to the right you will see the great incentives we are offering you. If you don't see a dollar amount on there that you like you can always write in any dollar amount from $1 and higher. All perks above $50 include free tickets to all Vandal Hockey home games in Moscow, ID.<br/></p>
<p>Over the course of the last four seasons, the University of Idaho Hockey program has teamed up with the Boise State Hockey Club and has helped raised just under <b>$80,000</b> for the Meals on Wheels organization in Boise, ID. Along with that, the Vandal Hockey Family has helped raise just under<b> $5,000</b> dollars for the Wildland Firefighting Foundation in central Idaho in the past three seasons.

<div>  Hello, my name is Sam. I'm one of the creators of Onima. Me and my friends started working on the game in mid 2014. We thought that this idea is super awesome! We really wanted to play a game like Onima for a while. So we decided to create it ourselves.<br/>  We are a small team working from Almaty, Kazakhstan. And it is really hard with game-dev in our country. So that's why we need professional help. If we reach our goal of 10 000$ we will invite some great professionals, who will help us finish this EPIC game!</div>

Its not an easy thing to create a game this caliber. And  that means a lot of work for our people. The more you donate, the more experts we can invite to join us. And that means the faster we will get the game done.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">2) We are not sure how many of you will want to get a 3D-printed statue or a T-Shirt  </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">so we wont guarantee that you will receive it on time, but what we do guarantee is that you will receive it! </span></p>

</div></div>","Key Features


Massive Multiplayer - a world full with danger and other players! 

Unique Gameplay - After you bought your first ship in Onima, it's all about gathering more resources to upgrade to or buy a much stronger ship. You can accomplish that in different ways. Battle other players, collect cargo and debris from there destroyed ship's. Or maybe some relaxing mining will help you get to your goal faster? 


Cool Spaceship Management - Entirely control your ship systems! This will help you to win battles with stronger players, lower or power up your shields, use you're cloak, charge your warp drive, repair you're damaged hull, scan sectors to detect other players, control ship's power supply and more! 


Plan Your Moves - In Onima stuff changes quickly! One wrong warp and you find you're self in a middle of a giant battle between 2 powerful factions. One wrong word and you can start a giant battle between 2 powerful factions! 


Missions - Onima also offers you an interesting plot. With missions you can find out more about Onima and its history. Doing missions will help you level up, which will get you bigger, stronger ships much faster 










  Hello, my name is Sam. I'm one of the creators of Onima. Me and my friends started working on the game in mid 2014. We thought that this idea is super awesome! We really wanted to play a game like Onima for a while. So we decided to create it ourselves.  We are a small team working from Almaty, Kazakhstan. And it is really hard with game-dev in our country. So that's why we need professional help. If we reach our goal of 10 000$ we will invite some great professionals, who will help us finish this EPIC game!











We will keep it clear and transparent!

 We will invite some professional guys from Russia, they will help us with preparing the DEMO version of the game. Now, those guys need a place to stay and we will have to pay for that. They cant work in our homes because there wont be enough of room for 8 of us,that's why we will need to rent a small office(325$ per month) and buy some basic furniture. Now to release anything at all we will require license unity 3D ownership. That is a must have for us.  Now we do understand that you are not entirely sure about all of this. But we can assure you that your money wont go to waste! We will sit day and night working on the game so that we could present it to you as soon as possible. We are hiring some really good people. People who really know what they are doing. People who think that Onima is a great game and will do anything to finish it. 
Here are some risks:1) We are creating a Massive Multiplayer game, and that means that there will be a lot of problems with the game in the very beginning. Its not an easy thing to create a game this caliber. And  that means a lot of work for our people. The more you donate, the more experts we can invite to join us. And that means the faster we will get the game done.
2) We are not sure how many of you will want to get a 3D-printed statue or a T-Shirt  so we wont guarantee that you will receive it on time, but what we do guarantee is that you will receive it! 
3) We cant be sure if we finish the game on time. But we will do our level best to do so. Creating a game is a hard process that requires a lot of time.  We really want this game to become a reality so we will work 24/7 on it.



3$ Perk
 Well most of the campaigns offer just a ""Thanks"" for 5 or less dollars.We are not the most! Our game will cost you 3.33$! And that means that you will get 1 copy of the game if you back-up us now!
10$  Perk

 For 10$ you will get 1 copy of the game, 1 copy of the demo version. Yeah... that's not much... And that's why you get 1 copy of the alpha version game on Steam(if we manage to get to Steam xD)!!!
15$  Perk

 15$, huh? You really like the game don't you? Well we really appreciate it! And for 15$ we will add you're name in to the game. It could be a name of an NPC, a name a ship, who knows? Maybe you will become the main hero in our plot! And 1 copy of the game on Steam. And 1 copy of the demo version!
20$ Perk
 Well man, you are just like... DA BEST! We love you really, we do! For 20$ we will gift you a unique T-Shirt with one of the many in-game space-ships! 1 copy of the demo version, 1 copy of the alpha version and 1 copy of the beta version... aaaand 1 copy of the complete game!
30$ Perk
 30$... Big fan, huh? So that's how much you love the game?Well then this is how much we love you: 1 super rare 3d-printed spaceship from the game! ""Volcano"" the rarest ship in the galaxy, and you will have it 3D printed!!!!! + 1 copy of every version!
45$ Perk
 You get 1 3D statue of the ""Volcano"", 2 T-Shits with Onima spaceships on them, 2 demo versions of the game, 2 alpha versions of the game, 2 beta versions and 1 complete game!


For the Creators!

Well, Creator... for you we are giving way a trip to Almaty, Kazakhstan! The most beautiful city in all of the Middle Asia. A week in one of the best hotels in Almaty the 
Rixos Hotel. A tour around Almaty from us the developers. A visit to our HQ.  Mad Catz® S.T.R.I.K.E.™ 7 Gaming Keyboard for PC, Mad Catz R.A.T 9 Gaming Mouse, G.L.I.D.E.9 Aluminum Gaming Surface and 10 copies of every version of the game!

<p>Bonjour et<span>  bienvenue
sur ma campagne Indiegogo! Je m’appelle Francis Groulx et je suis un étudiant
en communication-marketing à l’Université de Sherbrooke. Pour projet de stage,
j’ai comme objectif de parcourir le Canada au complet. Mon but : réaliser
une émission qui sera diffusé sur le Web Télé, pour chacune des provinces
visitée incluant la participation des diverses 
associations francophones dans l’optique d’inciter les francophones à
découvrir notre beau pays.</span></p>
<p><b>Pourquoi:</b></p>
<p>Ce projet me tiens vraiment à cœur puisque je désire faire partie
de votre quotidien dans le futur en tant qu’animateur Télé. En réalisant une

horaires différents, dans un seul but! - Découvrir les différentes <b><i>associations

Évidemment, il s’agit d’un petit montant pour 3 mois, mais c’est ce qui me
manque afin de compléter mon projet. </p>
<p>Grâce à l’aide de généreux contributeurs comme vous, le contenu

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Kate Payne, Digital Strategist</b> for <b>BRUCE</b>, is a digital media specialist and someone who loves fancy words. Kate has been working in social media and web branding since 2010 when she graduated from Hamilton College and moved to New York to start work at <a href=""http://www.tcgagency.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TCG Agency</a>, a digital branding agency specializing in fashion brands. From there Kate moved on within TCG to work in business development and pitching clients the perfect website and social media campaign to fit their needs. Following work at TCG, Kate took a break from marketing to travel the world (mostly in Asia) for a year, starting in Japan and literally landing, then leaving, places like Kabul, Afghanistan and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In 2014 Kate began working for <a href=""http://www.visualmax.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VisualMax</a>, the creative agency behind many of the award-winning online advertising campaigns which Yelp has used to help position itself as a cornerstone of new media. At VisualMax, Kate acted as a producer and marketing manager, ensuring that every advertising campaign, whether for Ford or Mastercard, fit the clients needs, functioned as needed and made the world of online advertising a more interesting, interactive place. Now Kate freelances and uses her skills for good to help smaller brands broaden their online presence, whether that means building a new website, designing a newsletter chain or managing the infrastructure of a social media campaign. In her free time (when she has it) Kate trains at UCB, is a tech intern at the PIT and performs and produces original videos with her video team. <br/></span></p>

<div><h3>BRUCE | The Message</h3></div>
<div>
<b>BRUCE</b> is close to our hearts because we believe that if you work hard at something you love and are passionate about, you can't go wrong--and this is the message of our film.  </div>
<div>
<b>BRUCE </b>is a story about a frustrated artist, Charlie, who is dragging himself through his days at a desk job he hates. Just as Charlie is at his breaking point, he meets the incredibly free-spirited and constantly inappropriate Bruce. Bruce takes Charlie under his wing and through a series of misadventures, graffiti, and bizarre pep-talks, reconnects him with his sense of humor and his passion. There’s an issue though, Bruce doesn’t exist. Charlie is the only person who can see and hear him. </div>
<div>Whether behind the scenes or on screen, the cast and crew of <b>BRUCE</b> are all working professionals at their craft, and they are contributing their time and effort pro-bono for love of the project, the script, and the message of the importance of integrating all the parts of oneself into pursuing one's life goals.</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Having previous working relationships with everyone on the cast and crew makes this process much smoother.  We have earned each other's trust, and this provides a more comfortable set environment for all involved and that is when the magic happens!</span><br/>
</div> <p>Contributors will not only be helping us make <b>BRUCE</b>, but you will help build a team that will continue to create awesome content for the rest of our careers.  And if you'd like to be on our team, now is the time to let us know. Join us! It is our goal to maintain the same core team and experience success together.  A rising tide lifts all boats.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>BRUCE | What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>While we can pull up our boot straps and get certain things like locations and props for free by doing extra leg work and mining Craigslist, we need help with equipment, transportation, and post-production costs like sound editing, color correction, and submission fees for film festivals. We are going all the way with this film, and you get to be right there with us for the ride as our contributors. We mean it--a rising tide lifts all boats--and we want you to be one of the boats in our tide. </p>
<p>Last night I watched <b>A Most Violent Year</b> and enjoyed it thoroughly. I was struck by Oscar Isaac's portrayal of Abel Morales. Morales' advice for pitching is that ""You'll never do anything harder than staring someone in the eye and telling them the truth."" And that's exactly how I feel about Indiegogo campaigns and asking for help. </p>
</div><div>
<div>Ultimately, we are going to shoot this film.  We will do whatever it takes to make the best film we can, and that includes asking for your help.  We're self-funding a large portion, but with your help, we can move mountains. We're setting the fundraising goal at it's absolute minimum (10K), but <b>depending on the success of this Indiegogo campaign, we may be able to attract a well-known performer to get more attention and ultimately make the film as successful as possible.</b>
</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div> </div> <div> <h3>BRUCE | Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Making a film is very difficult.  As soon as you think you've covered everything, there is inevitably another obstacle.  However, because we have done this many times before (shorts, feature-length web series, other films, commercials, etc.), we are comfortable in the environment and confident that as a team we can solve any issues that arise.</span></p>

In her free time (when she has it) Kate trains at UCB, is a tech intern at the PIT and performs and produces original videos with her video team. 

BRUCE | The Message

BRUCE is close to our hearts because we believe that if you work hard at something you love and are passionate about, you can't go wrong--and this is the message of our film.  

BRUCE is a story about a frustrated artist, Charlie, who is dragging himself through his days at a desk job he hates. Just as Charlie is at his breaking point, he meets the incredibly free-spirited and constantly inappropriate Bruce. Bruce takes Charlie under his wing and through a series of misadventures, graffiti, and bizarre pep-talks, reconnects him with his sense of humor and his passion. There’s an issue though, Bruce doesn’t exist. Charlie is the only person who can see and hear him. 
Whether behind the scenes or on screen, the cast and crew of BRUCE are all working professionals at their craft, and they are contributing their time and effort pro-bono for love of the project, the script, and the message of the importance of integrating all the parts of oneself into pursuing one's life goals.

Having previous working relationships with everyone on the cast and crew makes this process much smoother.  We have earned each other's trust, and this provides a more comfortable set environment for all involved and that is when the magic happens!
 Contributors will not only be helping us make BRUCE, but you will help build a team that will continue to create awesome content for the rest of our careers.  And if you'd like to be on our team, now is the time to let us know. Join us! It is our goal to maintain the same core team and experience success together.  A rising tide lifts all boats.
   BRUCE | What We Need & What You Get While we can pull up our boot straps and get certain things like locations and props for free by doing extra leg work and mining Craigslist, we need help with equipment, transportation, and post-production costs like sound editing, color correction, and submission fees for film festivals. We are going all the way with this film, and you get to be right there with us for the ride as our contributors. We mean it--a rising tide lifts all boats--and we want you to be one of the boats in our tide. 
Last night I watched A Most Violent Year and enjoyed it thoroughly. I was struck by Oscar Isaac's portrayal of Abel Morales. Morales' advice for pitching is that ""You'll never do anything harder than staring someone in the eye and telling them the truth."" And that's exactly how I feel about Indiegogo campaigns and asking for help. 

Ultimately, we are going to shoot this film.  We will do whatever it takes to make the best film we can, and that includes asking for your help.  We're self-funding a large portion, but with your help, we can move mountains. We're setting the fundraising goal at it's absolute minimum (10K), but depending on the success of this Indiegogo campaign, we may be able to attract a well-known performer to get more attention and ultimately make the film as successful as possible.

   BRUCE | Risks & Challenges Making a film is very difficult.  As soon as you think you've covered everything, there is inevitably another obstacle.  However, because we have done this many times before (shorts, feature-length web series, other films, commercials, etc.), we are comfortable in the environment and confident that as a team we can solve any issues that arise.

<h3><b>Why build Smile for Survival?</b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Not all cancer survivors and their families have the time to create marketing material, shoot a video or a circle of influence to succeed. When I was in recovery, the treatments and life survival was all I could think about. As a result, my family carried the burden of the financial hardship.</p>
<h4><b>One man show</b></h4>
<p>I will be the only one creating and updating this campaign. I have designed the logo, artwork for the T-Shirts, built the website, created the videos and prepared the perks and rewards. I won't take a salary or receive compensation for the work. There are treatment, family and campaign expenses that come first. I have an attorney ready to prepare the necessary paperwork with the state and federal government for the non-profit status.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Many hours have been spent working on the different areas of this campaign. These type of campaigns are hard to build and </span>communicate<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> on social media, so please </span>appreciate<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> the skill set and marketing.</span></span></p>

radiation treatments three years ago. There was a chance my jaw would break because of its
weakened state and my weak and damaged heart may fail during the procedure. 
I met with the oral
surgeon two weeks later and he too was concerned about the removal of the wisdom teeth.  He required that I take 30 days (6 weeks) of treatment in a Hyperbaric Chamber , 20 days (4 weeks) before the oral surgery and
10 days (2 weeks) after. The two hour-per-day hyperbaric treatment will strengthen my jaw and heart
muscle. Insurance denied the treatment and we appealed. Three months later  the treatment finally begins.
The expenses and bills will create a hardship for my family and I wanted to create a solution to cover the expenses. 
It is a hard and humbling moment to ask for help.
""Smile for Survival""   is my way of finding that solution for my family and other cancer survivors that need help. Check out:  www.SmileforSurvival.com
When the campaign is successful, we will share our experience in the campaign with other cancer survivors and their families and work to provide support for them as well.  
My story and experience with cancer
The video updates on this campaign are my current experiences and a reflection three years later and the effects the cancer treatment has on my life now.
I’ll go into detail about my cancer and treatment.  I’ll share about the first time I felt the bump to the day they released me cancer free. I will share the surgery, chemo, radiation and recovery. I'll talk about the depression, disfigurement, medications, physical therapy, long stays in ICU and heart failure.
I will share with you about the financial losses, the missed moments with my kid's life, the lawsuits from doctors and a medical institution for my treatments.
Most importantly, how lucky I am to have a wife, family and church as my support during recovery.


The perks you buy will help to fulfill the financial needs created by treatment and to bring more awareness of long term effects of cancer. Obviously the needs and the use of funds may change based on the events of the treatment, but the principle ideas is to assist when needed.
I never attended a support group about the effects of my cancer or my depression, so this campaign and the videos maybe my way of dealing with feelings and having some closure on the struggles of the past three years.
Please help make Smile for Survival a success. 
Give the Gift of Support!
It all begins Tuesday, October 20, 2015.
""Smile for Survival, Life Beyond Cancer""

 
The Smile for Survival  fundraiser helps to raise public awareness and much needed funds for cancer survivors and their families as the go through the journey of recovery. These are most often the living expenses and bills that are not paid by
insurance companies. More stories on www.SmileforSurvival.com coming soon.



Once we reach the goal our volunteer staff will begin creating a template campaign that can be duplicated by other cancer survivors and their families that need assistance. 

If you have a business and would like to contribute to our efforts, please contact me at 801-923-3533 or SmileforSurvival@gmail.com for the details. We can create a gift certificates to be redeemed for products and services at your local business. 
Why build Smile for Survival?
Not all cancer survivors and their families have the time to create marketing material, shoot a video or a circle of influence to succeed. When I was in recovery, the treatments and life survival was all I could think about. As a result, my family carried the burden of the financial hardship.
One man show
I will be the only one creating and updating this campaign. I have designed the logo, artwork for the T-Shirts, built the website, created the videos and prepared the perks and rewards. I won't take a salary or receive compensation for the work. There are treatment, family and campaign expenses that come first. I have an attorney ready to prepare the necessary paperwork with the state and federal government for the non-profit status.
Many hours have been spent working on the different areas of this campaign. These type of campaigns are hard to build and communicate on social media, so please appreciate the skill set and marketing.





Perks and Rewards
Buy a Juice, Diet Soda or Hot Coco
If you could buy us a juice, diet soda or a hot chocolate for $5.00.  With all the trips to and from the hospital for treatment, a comfort drink is appreciated. 



          
If you would like to help us build Smile for Survival, a non-profit company, then a drink would be a great help to volunteer staff. 


Fuel and Transportation
Buy us some Fuel for transportation $10.00. Every visit to the hospital or treatment center requires transportation from the home and it requires up to $10.00 per day.

                        If you would like to help us build Smile for Survival, a non-profit company, then we will create a ""Fuel Fund"" for future cancer survivor recipients and help our volunteer staff. 




T-Shirt - Smile for Survival - ""Smile if You Love a Cancer Survivor""
Buy a T-Shirt for $20.00. These are high quality t-shirts that can show off your pride for a cancer survivor. 







T-Shirt - Smile for Survival - ""Smile if You Love a Cancer Survivor""
Buy the Family 6 T-Shirt Package for $135.00.  The family 6 t-shirt package is for those that want to share their pride for a cancer survivor in their family.  We can add your family name on the back of these 6 t-shirts packages.

Dinner with My Wife
Buy us a dinner out for $50. So often the cancer patient has the support of their spouse, but doesn't have the funds to dine out or a date night. The spouse needs a ""time out"" from the stress of the home and the medical treatments.A fine dining experience can help relieve the stress of the family hardship.

<p>Once the basics have been established, the documentary leads on to an interview with a recovering drug addict who will explain the importance of being aware of the purity levels of drugs when consuming, to determine dosage.

<p>Within this film we also hope to benefit from professional expertise including an MP, drug specialists and deep/dark web analysts. Finally we hope to interview Russell Brand. As a public figure, recovered drug addict and a believer that the current drug laws need changing he will be perfect for this documentary. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p></p>
<p>Travel: £400</p>
<p>As this documentary will be based in Central London, transporting crew and equipment will be very costly. We will endeavour use the most cost effective modes of transport nonetheless. Travel Expenses will cover the congestion charge, petrol and Oyster Card fees that will enable us to get to our destinations to hold interviews!</p>
<p>Equipment: £1050 </p>
<p>We are planning to shoot this documentary on a hired Cannon C300 with a full lens set. By using this camera in particular we will be able to create a sleek and captivating look yet still enabling the documentary to be broadcast ready. </p>
<p>Voice over Artist: £100 </p>
<p>Using a voice over artist who can convey the style and mood of this documentary will really set off the tone of the documentary, while also giving an informative narrative. </p>
<p>Catering: £400 </p>
<p>Keeping your crew warm with hot drinks and full bellies is so important, especially when running around on location in the winter months. Every day will be a 12 hour shoot which means breakfast, lunch and dinner will be needed to sustain the crew! </p>
<p>Location Hire: £500 </p>
<p>A very import aspect of documentary is being able to situate your contributors in the correct setting that represents their personality as well as their message. As this documentary will have around 8 interviews, we will need to locate a range of locations in central London.</p>
<p>DVD Printing - £50 </p>
<p>After the production is complete we will be printing around 20 copies of the final product, some of which will be sent out to our donators. This will include the cases, printing and burning of the DVD’s</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>This documentary will be the first of its kind to reveal a world known as “the dark net”. Being the first, means that we need to be careful in the message we convey and how we display this controversial topic. By completing this documentary we hope to shed new information on current UK drug laws and enlighten the public how one could see the unexpected benefits that “the dark net” could provide.</p>
<p>In this documentary we hope to interview someone with firsthand knowledge of what it is like having had a drug problem. This subject must be handled with care and delicacy as it could be one of the hardest and distressing chapters of the interviewee’s life. Therefore, making them feel comfortable is paramount, so that they might help others in their journey of recovering from a drug addiction.</p>
<p>This shoot has an extremely tight filming schedule, shooting over the short period of four days. Luckily, I have a strong production team who I have the utmost confidence in, to timetable all the interviews and actuality that we will need to capture and fit it into a well organised schedule.</p>
<p>The topic at hand is extremely controversial and entirely contemporary, with talks being held at present about reforming the UK failing drug laws. The Silk Road is a very interesting website to explore and share what it has to offer, when revising the UK drug laws.</p>

We hope you will embrace this opportunity to support this series 
without prejudice, and without any pre-conceived notion in our attempt 
to elevate the sport by creating a positive awareness within the community
 and abroad, through story telling and high end competition.
I have heard many stories that are heart felt and emotionally driven in these past few weeks 
and those stories deserve to be heard and seen.  We have the platform where many stories, just like yours can be seen and heard. But in order for this to happen, we must work together to achieve that common goal. Increase the awareness of girls fastpitch and create opportunities for our young ladies. Today, we have that opportunity to expand the boundaries for our female athletes and it starts with you.USSSA, ASA, TCS, PGF and NPF has provided opportunities for our athletes access to develop their skills and compete.  We owe them gratitude for their continued effort to compete and raise the level of competition.  We owe gratitude to Sue Enquist and others like her who work tirelessly in educating the community of the value that female sports offers to a young female. 

Fastpitch World is being distributed by a major sports network that 
will air our hour long episodes during prime time hours on a 
weeknight. 
Last but certainly not least, a big thanks to those parents, coaches, tournament directors, mentors, sponsors, non-profits and media for providing hopes and dreams to millions of young athletes across the globe. 
We want to inspire
and empower young women in sports and raise awareness of the incredible game
that is fastpitch softball. Amanda Lorenz-OC Batbusters

looking for Lady drivers however we have found two female conductors who will
be in direct contact with the woman and girls off/on the bus while collecting
the transport fares from the women passengers. By the end of this week the
second bus in the same route will be ready. We have further plans of extending
this service to the chakra- path-this is a round route around Kathmandu valley
which will benefit thousands of women everyday who use public transport. This initiative will deprive sex
starved males from fondling and touching females unnecessarily and free the
females of the psychological trauma of such embarrassments and harassment. In
future, Also women with less education, skills and access to resources will be
benefited economically when we train them as drivers &amp; conductors and this
transport industry can  be change and  will be improved  dramatically for the betterment of society. </p>

<p>As
a child growing up my family would take the long drive to our Grandparent's home,
where my Aunt lived next door.  I adored my Aunt; she would love it when
my sisters and I did her hair and make-up.  Then we would play music and
dance the afternoon away, at least until our weekly family dinner was
ready.  We always knew she was different, but we didn't care.  She
was always kind to us.</p>
<p>As
we became older we became more aware of how adults talked about my Aunt. We
would hear our people refer to her as
""Crazy"" or when she was away she was at the ""Crazy House"".
One incident I remember clearly was when she attacked my aunt, there did not
seem to be any reason for the provocation but it took both my father and my
uncle to restrain and calm her down.  Once it was over me and my sisters
were told to go play like it was just some normal occurrence.</p>
<p>Years
later I discovered, when my Aunt was in her 20s and they were all living in New
York City, she and a group of ""friends"" went out for a night on the town. 
None of us know what actually happened but they said when she returned home her hair was
a mess, she was scratched and bruised, and did not want to talk or hear about
it.  No matter how much she wanted to discount it, this event seemed to be
the trigger to her mental illness.  An illness my family would rather deal
with by pretending things were normal, this event did not happen, and she was
just “crazy”.</p>
<p>This
is not so unique to just my family; I see it in every city across this country.  People sitting on the sidewalk, in doorways, and  camped out in alleys are someone's aunt, uncle, parent, cousin, sister, brother, and child.  When I watch the news,
I see the stories of tragedy and I ask what could have helped make the
outcome of those stories different... my answer <b>AWARENESS</b>.</p>

Hi,  I'm Mike Tikkanen, long time Hennepin County volunteer guardian ad-Litem, Founder of Kids At Risk Action (501c3), and author/speaker on children's issues. 
KARA'S Public Television Expose/Documentary partnership is bringing awareness and change to the thousands of abused and neglected children that go without help in our communities each year.  
KARA has delivered this message in person and in print to many communities over the years (including a presentation at the United Nations). This televised opportunity will reach tons more people and have much more impact.  
Best of all, long time American news anchor and investigative journalist and winner of Emmy and Peabody awards Don Shelby is advising us on the project.  The protection of all children, is to his mind, the responsibility of all adults.
Core issues;

Mental health and *coping skills – if not delivered in the home they must come from the community.  Help KARA bring wellness to children, lower crime, empty prisons, and make schools and our communities happier and more productive.  

Our institutions today are creating exactly what they were designed to stop.  Child protection services workers are seeing the fourth, fifth, and sixth generation of abused and neglected children re-entering the system with their own dysfunctional families (because they don’t have the mental health* coping or parenting skills to do otherwise).*Dr Read Sulik’s definition of Mental health is “the ability to cope in one's own environment.”  Traumatized children often lack these skills.
Committed and hardworking people doing the work cannot meet the needs of children they serve - the traumas abused children have experienced exceed training, resources, and capacity of foster/adoptive families and the institutions trying to help.  
Political neglect and lack of public awareness keep things the same. 


The documentary will blend experts and stories from children, families, and people involved in the lives of traumatized children.  KARA is highlighting the work of The Academy on Violence and Abuse, Safe Passages For Children, CASA, the Youth Law Center, foster and adoptive parents, court and justice workers and administrators along with children who are in or have passed through the child protection system.
Kids At Risk Action believes that once more people know how our institutions are failing our children, change will happen, and the cycle of abused and neglected children having their own families of abused children will be broken and all children can grow up to lead productive lives.  Schools will graduate more students, prisons will become empty, and streets will become safer.For more information on KARA visit our website; www.invisiblechildren.orgKARA seeks one hundred and twenty eight thousand five hundred dollars to fund this project.  The cost breakdown appears at our site under ""About Us""Major donors will receive televised recognition, all donors will be recognized, and our book, INVISIBLE CHILDREN will be sent to all donors of $50 or more.Share this online and with your friends, write to us at our blog, and consider inviting KARA to speak at your next event.Thank you, Kids At Risk Actioninfo@invisiblechildren.org",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p></p><h3><b>What is APAIT?</b></h3><p>The Asian Pacific AIDS Intervention Team (APAIT) is a community-based organization that has been caring for Asian and Pacific Islanders (API) and other communities of color living with or at-risk for HIV/AIDS. Since 1987, APAIT has become the largest comprehensive API AIDS service organization in Southern California. Alongside HIV Testing, we provide access to a wide array of supportive services. APAIT is a division of Special Service for Groups (SSG), a non-profit human service agency that was established in 1952.</p><h3><b>Who is APAIT?</b></h3><p></p><p>At
APAIT, we strive to improve the health and overall well-being, as well as to
address the health disparities, among APIs and marginalized communities living
with or at-risk for HIV/AIDS through our culturally competent and
linguistically appropriate programs. We welcome anyone who walks through our
door and aim to provide the best quality services with respect, compassion, and
integrity.</p>
<p>We
offer walk-in HIV testing, case management, support groups, mental health
counseling, outpatient substance abuse treatment, and housing assistance. APAIT
programs have successfully led to improved social support, mental health, and
access-to-care among individuals living with HIV/AIDS; improved risk reduction
among participants in HIV prevention and substance abuse treatment; and reduced
stigma related to HIV among minority groups.</p><p></p><blockquote> <i>“APAIT’s approach has always been holistic. They treat the person, not the disease.” </i>– <i>Mario, client</i>
</blockquote><h4><b><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FEPfCi_Q-jtE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEPfCi_Q-jtE&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FEPfCi_Q-jtE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/></b></h4><h4><b>For over 28 years, APAIT continues to practice its core value of commitment to advocate for our clients and the community.</b></h4><p></p><p>One of
our goals as an organization is to serve hard to-reach clients. With HIV
testing technology developing rapidly, APAIT strives to reach underserved individuals and to meet them where they are or feel most
comfortable. Last year, APAIT identified a higher proportion of newly diagnosed
individuals (with a 2.55% seropositivity rate) as compared to countywide
testing (with a 1.19% seropositivity rate). Nonetheless, our ability to test off-site
is limited due to our inability to secure private testing spaces.<span> Alongside this, there are multiple barriers that
prevent individuals from getting tested: (1) It may be hard for some individuals to
take time out of their week to go to a health center. (2) Others may be scared of
the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, which may cause them to not want to be
seen at a health/testing center. (3) There are individuals who simply have
never thought about getting tested. </span></p><p><span>In order to address these barriers,
we feel that our next step is to invest in a mobile testing van. This will
allow us to expand our ability to provide HIV testing services to communities
that are at greatest risk for HIV. Early detection will save lives.  </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p><p>We are currently looking at a 2014 Ford Transit Connect Cargo Van to utilize as our mobile testing unit. The van has optimal space for us to retrofit to our needs in order to provide mobile testing. </p><h4>Here’s the breakdown of what the $30,000 will go towards:</h4><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1299957/files/20150316142834-pieChart_jpg.jpeg?1426541314"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><ul><br/></ul><p>Mobile testing will encourage people to test more frequently, as we provide HIV testing beyond our storefront to the communities most in need. APAIT will be able to reach areas that have high infection rates, such as Skid Row - an area of Downtown Los Angeles inhabited by a dense population of homeless people. APAIT will also be able to serve populations that have low testing rates. The API population, for example, currently has a 33% testing rate, which is the lowest amongst any ethnicity. From 2001 to 2008, HIV diagnosis rates were higher for APIs than any other racial/ethnic group, as the rates for other racial/ethnic groups declined during that time span. Since then, the number of HIV diagnosis rates has remained stable, but still is considered relatively high given the low percentage of individuals getting tested within the API community. Within the transgender community, less than 1% of the population get tested (<a href=""http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/dhsp/Reports/HIV/HIVTestingServicesAnnualReport2011.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Source</a>). <span style="""">This is concerning since
a recent study led by Dr. Stefan Baral, Director of the Key Populations Program in the Center for Public Health and Human Rights at Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health, determined that transgender women are 49 times more
likely to contract HIV.</span></p><p>Our mobile testing van will also serve as a vehicle for outreach and allow us to reach individuals who otherwise may not know about our free community services that include mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, housing assistance, and social services navigation.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1299962/files/20150316142931-van4.jpg?1426541371"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h4>
<b>According to the Los Angeles County’s Division of HIV and STD Programs, </b><b>there are roughly 9,500 individuals that are infected with HIV in Los Angeles County, but are unaware of their status (</b><b><a href=""http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/dhsp/Presentations/EstimatedPLWH2013.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Source</a></b><b>).</b>
</h4><p></p><p>Within the United
States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates there are 1.2 million aged 13 years and older living with HIV, including nearly
168,000 (14%) who are unaware of their infection (<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/basics/ataglance.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Source</a>). N<span>ot knowing one’s status can
lead to more harmful repercussions. Those who remain unaware, remain untreated,
and do not practice preventative measures, run the risk of spreading the
infection. Moreover, treatment is costly; in 2010, it cost $23,000 a year to
treat an HIV positive person (</span><a href=""http://events.aidschicago.org/site/PageServer?pagename=t2_facts_and_figures"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Source</a>). APAIT aims to reach the
undiagnosed HIV positive population in hopes of providing the support needed
for these individuals to successfully access and stay in medical care, as well as to increase the number of virally suppressed individuals, which will
ultimately decrease the infection rate.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FllC_ZJJ4z2k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DllC_ZJJ4z2k&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FllC_ZJJ4z2k%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><h4><b>So how is this project beneficial to you?</b></h4><p></p><p>Since

</span></div></div>","What is APAIT?The Asian Pacific AIDS Intervention Team (APAIT) is a community-based organization that has been caring for Asian and Pacific Islanders (API) and other communities of color living with or at-risk for HIV/AIDS. Since 1987, APAIT has become the largest comprehensive API AIDS service organization in Southern California. Alongside HIV Testing, we provide access to a wide array of supportive services. APAIT is a division of Special Service for Groups (SSG), a non-profit human service agency that was established in 1952.Who is APAIT?At
APAIT, we strive to improve the health and overall well-being, as well as to
address the health disparities, among APIs and marginalized communities living
with or at-risk for HIV/AIDS through our culturally competent and
linguistically appropriate programs. We welcome anyone who walks through our
door and aim to provide the best quality services with respect, compassion, and
integrity.
We
offer walk-in HIV testing, case management, support groups, mental health
counseling, outpatient substance abuse treatment, and housing assistance. APAIT
programs have successfully led to improved social support, mental health, and
access-to-care among individuals living with HIV/AIDS; improved risk reduction
among participants in HIV prevention and substance abuse treatment; and reduced
stigma related to HIV among minority groups. “APAIT’s approach has always been holistic. They treat the person, not the disease.” – Mario, client
For over 28 years, APAIT continues to practice its core value of commitment to advocate for our clients and the community.One of
our goals as an organization is to serve hard to-reach clients. With HIV
testing technology developing rapidly, APAIT strives to reach underserved individuals and to meet them where they are or feel most
comfortable. Last year, APAIT identified a higher proportion of newly diagnosed
individuals (with a 2.55% seropositivity rate) as compared to countywide
testing (with a 1.19% seropositivity rate). Nonetheless, our ability to test off-site
is limited due to our inability to secure private testing spaces. Alongside this, there are multiple barriers that
prevent individuals from getting tested: (1) It may be hard for some individuals to
take time out of their week to go to a health center. (2) Others may be scared of
the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, which may cause them to not want to be
seen at a health/testing center. (3) There are individuals who simply have
never thought about getting tested. In order to address these barriers,
we feel that our next step is to invest in a mobile testing van. This will
allow us to expand our ability to provide HIV testing services to communities
that are at greatest risk for HIV. Early detection will save lives.   We are currently looking at a 2014 Ford Transit Connect Cargo Van to utilize as our mobile testing unit. The van has optimal space for us to retrofit to our needs in order to provide mobile testing. Here’s the breakdown of what the $30,000 will go towards:Mobile testing will encourage people to test more frequently, as we provide HIV testing beyond our storefront to the communities most in need. APAIT will be able to reach areas that have high infection rates, such as Skid Row - an area of Downtown Los Angeles inhabited by a dense population of homeless people. APAIT will also be able to serve populations that have low testing rates. The API population, for example, currently has a 33% testing rate, which is the lowest amongst any ethnicity. From 2001 to 2008, HIV diagnosis rates were higher for APIs than any other racial/ethnic group, as the rates for other racial/ethnic groups declined during that time span. Since then, the number of HIV diagnosis rates has remained stable, but still is considered relatively high given the low percentage of individuals getting tested within the API community. Within the transgender community, less than 1% of the population get tested (Source). This is concerning since
a recent study led by Dr. Stefan Baral, Director of the Key Populations Program in the Center for Public Health and Human Rights at Johns Hopkins
School of Public Health, determined that transgender women are 49 times more
likely to contract HIV.Our mobile testing van will also serve as a vehicle for outreach and allow us to reach individuals who otherwise may not know about our free community services that include mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, housing assistance, and social services navigation.
According to the Los Angeles County’s Division of HIV and STD Programs, there are roughly 9,500 individuals that are infected with HIV in Los Angeles County, but are unaware of their status (Source).
Within the United
States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates there are 1.2 million aged 13 years and older living with HIV, including nearly
168,000 (14%) who are unaware of their infection (Source). Not knowing one’s status can
lead to more harmful repercussions. Those who remain unaware, remain untreated,
and do not practice preventative measures, run the risk of spreading the
infection. Moreover, treatment is costly; in 2010, it cost $23,000 a year to
treat an HIV positive person (Source). APAIT aims to reach the
undiagnosed HIV positive population in hopes of providing the support needed
for these individuals to successfully access and stay in medical care, as well as to increase the number of virally suppressed individuals, which will
ultimately decrease the infection rate.So how is this project beneficial to you?Since
the beginning of the epidemic, HIV has directly affected millions of lives. You
may not have HIV, nor may be aware of anyone that has HIV, but HIV is more
common than you think. People can live with the virus for a long period of time
without showing any signs of infection and may spread it unknowingly. By knowing one’s
status, people can make conscious health decisions regarding their health and in doing so, the health of others. Join us in taking the necessary steps to help prevent the
spread of HIV and to provide treatment for those who are living with HIV/AIDS.Here at
APAIT, we recognize that the struggle expands across communities. Thank you for
helping us not only save lives, but also improve the quality of lives. Don’t
forget to know your status and to help others know theirs too! “I have been HIV positive for 28 years. I should be dead by now, but because of the help from APAIT, they have kept me alive and I greatly appreciate it. The reason why I appreciate it is because of the wonderful staff who helped me with medication, counseling, and referrals. I will always be indebted to them for the rest of life.” – Rodney, Client

Films are stories told in sound and images, through framing and colors. By shifting colors, their intensity, or the exposure of the picture, a filmmaker creates nuances in the way a story is perceived by viewers. 
For “The Fallen”, a soft but dark tone will be used with an emphasis on shadows for the surroundings. The harsh, dark shadow will allow for a deep picture that instantly tells the audience that something mysterious is involved. The strong contrast will help to create an intriguing look. 
Below are some examples of the look and color palette to be used.

                                    

What’s next:

This first short has to be seen as a proof of concept, which will then allow us to aim higher and execute the remaining three installments. Once the entire series is created, we will be in a position to promote the series through different web content platforms such as Amazon Prime, Hulu and Netflix. 
In order to guide particularly selective audiences towards us, we want to first generate some interest by running the festival circuit. Some of the international festivals we intend to submit to promote science fiction content.  They are:
- Athens International Sci-Fi & Fantasy Film Festival: Athens, Greece
- Trieste International Science Fiction Film Festival: Trieste, Italy
- Festival Internacional de Cinema de Catalunya: Sitges, Spain
- Neuchåtel International Fantastic Film Festival: Lund, Sweeden
- London International Festival of Science Fiction: London, England
- International Horror & Sci-Fi Film Festival: Scottsdale, Arizona
- Rincón Film Festival: Rincón, Puerto Rico
- Cinefiesta: San Juan, Puerto Rico

The recognition we gain through festivals we allow us to attract a wider audience and additional funds for the remaining three installments.
Risks & Challenges





Unfortunately, if the $10,000 goal is not reached, production of the pilot title The Fallen that serve as an introduction to The Awakening Project web series will cease, that is why your help is crucial for this project. It is not easy to collect the necessary funding in order to bring this story to life on my own. Even if you are not able to financially support the project, you can still help it by spreading the word around on social media sources like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. By doing this, you will help bring traffic to the crowd funding campaign and help us achieve the $10,000 goal. I will be greatly appreciative all of your support!

BUT we still need help to reach our goal! We have 15 days left of our campaign. With another $9,000.00 we will be able to make our series IN FULL and get people watching! 
If you haven't already thought about donating, don't think about it just do it! Right now! The button is right there! 
If you HAVE already contributed, THANK YOU! What you can do now is SHARE! Remind people what a great project this is and why you're involved and why they should be too! 



                     

Long time New Yorkers and best friends, Jess and Dakota end up back in their home town for very different reasons. The one thing they have in common - they’re broke. Dakota is a fast talking, hard-edged Brooklyn artist with a soft side. Jess is a writer grappling with what it means to be a woman in a very male driven industry. Back in the small New England town they grew up in, the two learn that you can try to escape your problems, but they always come with you. Laughter really is the best medicine in this comedy about friendship, going back, growing up, and learning how to be alone...together.



                           
Dakota will explore her issues with perfectionism and helicopter parents. She will have to face her reliance on her sexuality, and will be challenged when she meets a person who just might be worth having more than just a physical relationship with. 

                            

Jess is close to the success she’s always wanted, but her emotional walls make it hard to break through in her writing. A serial monogamist, she is single for the first time and desperately trying to stay that way. A friend from her past resurfaces and makes that particularly hard for her. 




Throughout the series, the women will try to get their heads above water financially by running (and almost ruining) a town fundraiser, cleaning a dead man’s apartment, hosting an Airbnb that goes horribly awry, and, the ultimate vocation of an artist, waiting tables.
The show is exploring love in all forms: platonic, romantic, and self love.


                     

The title is a play on words, referring to the fact that Dakota and Jess are perpetually alone (together) and perpetually in debt, a predicament common among those walking the line between gen X and millennials. An element of the series is also examining what it means to be a part of a generation that tells you to pursue your passions and then puts a stigma on not being financially independent by a certain age. The show aims to explore the dichotomy of “follow your dreams” and “pay off your loans.”                     
Loaners has truly been a group effort. We have so many people working with us and supporting us. We can't wait for you to come on board!

<div>Corrections Corporation of America, or CCA, makes a huge profit off of locking up people and even <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/08/america-s-most-lucrative-preschooler-prison.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">entire immigrant families</a>.  Now, this deplorable company with a history of inhumane treatment and a plethora of human rights violations has set its sights on winning an <a href=""http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/dallas-county-set-for-another-corrections-contract-fight-7673764"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">80 YEAR contract with Dallas County</a>.<br/><br/>Several years ago, CCA was kicked out of Dallas after repeated violence and <a href=""http://www.texasobserver.org/death-at-dawson-why-is-texass-worst-state-jail-still-open/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ignorance of human suffering</a> occurred at Dawson State Jail (nicknamed Texas' Worst Jail). However, a decision is set to be made this month that will determine whether or not CCA is allowed back in Dallas until at least the year 2095.<br/><br/><h3>The Impact</h3>We cannot allow such medical negligence and profiting off of vulnerable humans to happen under our watch. Until now, CCA has received very little pushback and has been allowed to amass a billion-dollar operation that relies on keeping as many people locked up for as long as they can. CCA needs to hear the voice of the people rising up to say NO MORE. Not on our watch. <br/><br/><b>For some perspective on our campaigns:</b> <br/>Last year, citizens of Dallas County and concerned folks around the country banded together to organize against the Securus contract in Dallas County. This contract was set to eliminate in-person visitation in the jail, in favor of a for-profit video visitation system. We spearheaded this effort to defeat the corrections phone giant Securus, but your direct involvement and coming out to show support is what really turned the tide and allowed a <a href=""http://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2014/09/09/dallas-securus/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">victory for all families and loved ones of inmates</a>. This <br/>grassroots movement eventually turned into <a href=""http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/texas-legislature-mandates-in-person-visitation-for-county-jail-inmates-7257291"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">statewide legislation</a>!<br/><br/>Now, we have an even bigger battle to face. Please partner with us as we work to defeat CCA's agenda with our county.<br/><br/><h3>About Organize Justice<br/>
</h3>
Josh Gravens is the Executive Director of <a href=""www.facebook.com/OrganizeJustice"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/OrganizeJustice"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Organize Justice</a>. He is also a Soros Justice Fellow and formerly worked as the Chair of Texas CURE. During his youth, Josh was incarcerated for 3.5 years in the Texas juvenile justice system (TYC). He now uses his unique background and understanding of the inner workings of the system to network with policymakers and officials, and advocate for change within the justice system. <br/><br/>Josh frequently speaks to groups in Texas and around the country, sharing his story, challenging perceptions, and showing others how they too can make a difference. He has also contributed as a writer or been the subject of numerous publications. <br/><br/>Under the heading of Organize Justice, Josh's small and growing team work to restore involvement in the democratic process to citizens who have become disenfranchised by the criminal justice system. <br/><br/>Organizing such groups of people takes unceasing passion, a whole lot of effort, and consistent resources in order to effectively mobilize citizens (who may not have an understanding of how they can be involved in truly affecting change for their local communities). Your support is invaluable in helping maximize our efforts to empower citizens and, collectively, fight mass incarceration giants.<br/><br/>

</div> <div> <h3>We Need Your Help to Stop CCA!</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Please donate today. Your tax-deductible donation will allow us to more effectively STOP and organize against the proposed CCA contract for
 Dallas County halfway houses and potential detention centers being built.<br/></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The truth is, we are fighting back against a massive entity. However, we believe that by leveraging media strategies, public input forums such as Commissioners Court, and community engagement of allied citizens, we can make a real difference and draw attention to the larger issue of mass incarceration. <br/><br/>This campaign is really the beginning of a larger movement to both educate the public about the travesties of the incarceral system and how it affects our whole community, and rally newly-informed citizens to help change policies and STOP the steamrolling by huge, for-profit prison companies.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>1. Share on Facebook and Twitter. 
If you aren't able to give, please help us spread the word by posting 
this link on your social media accounts. The public at large needs to 
know what CCA is doing, and what

Corrections Corporation of America, or CCA, makes a huge profit off of locking up people and even entire immigrant families.  Now, this deplorable company with a history of inhumane treatment and a plethora of human rights violations has set its sights on winning an 80 YEAR contract with Dallas County.Several years ago, CCA was kicked out of Dallas after repeated violence and ignorance of human suffering occurred at Dawson State Jail (nicknamed Texas' Worst Jail). However, a decision is set to be made this month that will determine whether or not CCA is allowed back in Dallas until at least the year 2095.The ImpactWe cannot allow such medical negligence and profiting off of vulnerable humans to happen under our watch. Until now, CCA has received very little pushback and has been allowed to amass a billion-dollar operation that relies on keeping as many people locked up for as long as they can. CCA needs to hear the voice of the people rising up to say NO MORE. Not on our watch. For some perspective on our campaigns: Last year, citizens of Dallas County and concerned folks around the country banded together to organize against the Securus contract in Dallas County. This contract was set to eliminate in-person visitation in the jail, in favor of a for-profit video visitation system. We spearheaded this effort to defeat the corrections phone giant Securus, but your direct involvement and coming out to show support is what really turned the tide and allowed a victory for all families and loved ones of inmates. This grassroots movement eventually turned into statewide legislation!Now, we have an even bigger battle to face. Please partner with us as we work to defeat CCA's agenda with our county.About Organize Justice

Josh Gravens is the Executive Director of Organize Justice. He is also a Soros Justice Fellow and formerly worked as the Chair of Texas CURE. During his youth, Josh was incarcerated for 3.5 years in the Texas juvenile justice system (TYC). He now uses his unique background and understanding of the inner workings of the system to network with policymakers and officials, and advocate for change within the justice system. Josh frequently speaks to groups in Texas and around the country, sharing his story, challenging perceptions, and showing others how they too can make a difference. He has also contributed as a writer or been the subject of numerous publications. Under the heading of Organize Justice, Josh's small and growing team work to restore involvement in the democratic process to citizens who have become disenfranchised by the criminal justice system. Organizing such groups of people takes unceasing passion, a whole lot of effort, and consistent resources in order to effectively mobilize citizens (who may not have an understanding of how they can be involved in truly affecting change for their local communities). Your support is invaluable in helping maximize our efforts to empower citizens and, collectively, fight mass incarceration giants.

  We Need Your Help to Stop CCA!

Please donate today. Your tax-deductible donation will allow us to more effectively STOP and organize against the proposed CCA contract for
 Dallas County halfway houses and potential detention centers being built.
Risks & ChallengesThe truth is, we are fighting back against a massive entity. However, we believe that by leveraging media strategies, public input forums such as Commissioners Court, and community engagement of allied citizens, we can make a real difference and draw attention to the larger issue of mass incarceration. This campaign is really the beginning of a larger movement to both educate the public about the travesties of the incarceral system and how it affects our whole community, and rally newly-informed citizens to help change policies and STOP the steamrolling by huge, for-profit prison companies.
  Other Ways You Can Help1. Share on Facebook and Twitter. 
If you aren't able to give, please help us spread the word by posting 
this link on your social media accounts. The public at large needs to 
know what CCA is doing, and what 
citizens can do to let their voice be heard.

<p><b><i>We have enough for a launch already, and Tercer Milenio Mexico is coming on board January 11th, 2016 to kick in funding.  I am confident that we will reach our goal.  That said, keep contributions coming, we are now aiming for a U1.5 Cubesat with command ability through GlobalStar :)</i></b></p>

<p>Ionized radiation: we have a scintillation counter, that enables us to measure the various radiation in our satellites environment.  This is significant as it enables us to detect high energy particles, radiation, and other phenomenon.</p>
<p>Cameras: we will use two cameras with parabolic lenses, giving us a clear 360 degree view around our satellite.</p>
<p>Radar: while this is a hope, but may not be feasible, we would like to have radar capabilities on our sat.  Mini radars do exist, but they are a very new technology, so it may be difficult to get our hands on it.  Radar would give us another tool for measurement, and would be among the first radars in space.</p>
<p>If we raise enough funds, maybe we can get a radar on our sat, and have the ability to concretely verify objects in space.</p>
<p>Regardless of radar, our radiation detection and imagery will give us enough to verify high energy emitting objects in space.</p>

<p>Thousands of Korean-American students gathered over the past 30 years to discuss the issues of Korean-American identity, culture, history, and the Korean-American role in broader American society. The 90s and 2000s were a time of self-discovery, as Korean-Americans came together to find out what it meant to be Korean-American at a time when very few industry leaders throughout society were of Korean background, and when the Korean-American identity was not definite or prevalent in the mainstream.</p>
<p>The social status of Korea and the Korean-American community has shifted immensely just within the past 20, perhaps even 10, years. Now, students have many different Korean-American leaders in government, law, finance, business, entertainment, the arts, and much more to look up to. Korean culture has permeated throughout America and around the world, and the Korean-American community has become a driving force of bridging the two worlds.</p>

Korean American Students Conference (KASCON)

<p>There is no business like show business! The art of filmmaking is the ambiguity that lies ahead as there are a host of unique risks for every cinema that often goes unnoticed by the common audience- <i>Now and Then</i> is no different. We have tried our best to reduce the risks by spending a lot of time in our pre production stages. Even with ample planning, we were faced with a series of financial burdens- food, accommodation, and insurance for equipment, to mention a few. Luckily, we were able to get through both the pre production and post production stages with the help of our friends, family and local businesses. Now, as we enter the last phase of our film, we need your support!</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us showcase a project that we have worked very hard on but will also help spread awareness of the unspoken stories most South Asian women face, even today, in regards to the dating culture.</p>

<h3><b><i>What
is MaTiFoLi.com?</i></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are striving to become the most
comprehensive, location specific database of recreational activities found on
the web. Matifoli.com found that even though as a population we are bombarded
with vast amounts of information there still seems to be a need for well
organized mediums to relay that information, and that is where we come in.
Matifoli.com realized that people can spend days using popular search engines
or tourism websites researching information on a location they currently reside
in or one that they want to visit and still be left without results. More often
than not, people are only informed about the popular tourist destinations
because those are the only ones that are relayed in a search. If you are hoping
to find something to do that is a little off the beaten path, one of those
activities that you may only hear about through word of mouth, it can require a
lot of digging and can be very time consuming; I imagine most people simply give
up. Also, if people are visiting a location that in itself is off the beaten
path, there may not be any information at all. That is where Matifoli.com wants
to help! </p><p>

<h3><b><i>How
did you come up with the name Matifoli?</i></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><i>Matifoli is short for <b>MAKE TIME FOR LIFE</b>. It
is pronounced <b>MA-TEE-FOE-LEE</b>. Matifoli.com came to the conclusion that too many people today need to make time for life! Many of us have lost perspective
of what is important. We spend so much time worrying about money and working
long days that we forget to go out and enjoy ourselves and the people and
places around us. Do us a favour, put things into perspective for a second and
realize that the only thing that is concrete in this life is that you only have
this one life to live. If all you do is work and you don’t take the time to
step back and asses what is important to you, you could end up one day full of
regret because you never actually lived at all.</i></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p><b>                ""If you don't take the chance to live life, what can you say at the end of it?"" Naveen Andrews</b></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>We are not saying don’t work, but rather to simply
take some time to productively enjoy your time when you're not working. Take
some time to try new things, have fun with family and friends and enjoy the
simple the things in life. The world is full of amazing locations and
experiences, treat yourself to some fun every once in a while!</i></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b><i>What
else does MaTiFoLi.com offer as a company?</i></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><i>We are attempting to be different in every
way. A significant part of what we do as a company is share the gift of fun
with others. <br/></i></p><p><i></i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442265802/zon30gmprvlpwywksiq6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>What this means is that we are hoping to, on a weekly basis, give
deserving individuals or families the gift of recreation. Our plan is to have
small giveaways on our <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/matifoli"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>
page where people can win the chance to enjoy the gift of recreation either for themselves or people they know that may deserve a break. We are going to start off small, but
with your help and support we will be able to increase the reach and volume of
the gifts with every passing week. <p>
</p><p>
</p><p><i>As a kick off for MaTiFoLi.com, the company
had the privilege of surprising a deserving family that tragically lost their
mother, daughter and sister to cancer in late 2014 with a family vacation to
San Diego, California. It was more of a unique and fulfilling experience than
anyone can imagine and made us realize that there is amazing, positive people
everywhere you look. With the help of the extremely talented band The Soots, a
couple gift cards from Dave Strano, owner of Burrito Boyz in London Ontario and
Sue Coleman, owner of Thai Cuisine in London Ontario, and detailed trip
planning provided by Sue Richard of Robert Q in London Ontario, Matifoli.com
was able to truly make a difference in a deserving families life, all in the memory
of their loved one Mel. </i></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><i>Our goal at Matifoli.com is to take half of
our company profits and give the gift of fun to as many deserving families and
individuals as we can; we want to show people that there is more important
things than money, something that many corporations and governments have lost
sight of. We also wish to show people that there is still positivity in this
world even though the news never really mentions it anymore.</i></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><i>Since MaTiFoLi.com is attempting to stay away
from typical investors, it will allow the company to share profits with our
users and followers and their friends and acquaintances rather than have an obligation
to share profits with shareholders and investors. </i></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b><i>What will
MaTiFoLi.com do with the money raised in the crowd-funding campaign?</i></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><i>All of the money raised will either directly
or indirectly go towards Matifoli.com's users, either through website improvements or giving back to the community.</i></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><i>Our goal is to invest some of the money into
marketing and data entry to improve the usability of the site. Simply put, we
need content!! At first we may need to add some content ourselves but hopefully
in time, users will begin to add their own.</i></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><i>After the initial direct investment in the
company, the remaining funds raised will be going towards gifts that will be
given away on our social networking pages. We are hoping to use up to 50
percent of the funds raised to give back to people in communities around North
America and beyond.</i></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><i>If you or someone you know wish to promote
your recreationally focused business or activity by donating gift cards or
experiences to give away on our social pages, please contact us at
admin@matifoli.com. To us, recreation is everything people do outside of work. If
our definition of recreation encompasses your activity, please do not hesitate
to contact us!</i></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b><i>As
the CEO of Matifoli.com, what are your hopes for the future of the company?</i></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><i>I have always been a problem solver so my
hope for Matifoli.com is that it can help people enjoy their lives with greater
fulfillment. I hope that it can help people pursue their dreams, experience new
things, create lasting memories, make new friends, experience new cultures,

valuable asset, yet we tend to waste it, kill it, and spend it rather than
invest it.” - Jim Rohn


What
is MaTiFoLi.com?

We are striving to become the most
comprehensive, location specific database of recreational activities found on
the web. Matifoli.com found that even though as a population we are bombarded
with vast amounts of information there still seems to be a need for well
organized mediums to relay that information, and that is where we come in.
Matifoli.com realized that people can spend days using popular search engines
or tourism websites researching information on a location they currently reside
in or one that they want to visit and still be left without results. More often
than not, people are only informed about the popular tourist destinations
because those are the only ones that are relayed in a search. If you are hoping
to find something to do that is a little off the beaten path, one of those
activities that you may only hear about through word of mouth, it can require a
lot of digging and can be very time consuming; I imagine most people simply give
up. Also, if people are visiting a location that in itself is off the beaten
path, there may not be any information at all. That is where Matifoli.com wants
to help! 

We have arranged over 80 categories of recreational
activities in a highly ergonomic manner to allow users to share, find and
promote activities with ease in geo-specific locations across the globe. If you
are a recreational focused business owner, an activity planner or simply
someone organizing something as simple as a pickup game and you want to spread
the word about your activity, simply place the info on MaTiFoLi.com for free!
If you wish to make the activity you are sharing more visible to users, you are
provided the ability to promote your activity to more visible areas of the site
such as the homepage, activity page and/or top of your activity category for a
small fee. Our goal at Matifoli.com is to allow recreational focused
companies and activity planners to get the word out as easily and efficiently
as possible and encourage our users to seek out and experience as many of the
activities as they can.The most important thing that Matifoli.com is
trying to do is make it easy to share and find fun in every community around
the world! For this reason, we consider ourselves to be as much of a community
based recreation site as a mass tourism site. So whether you're a curious local
or a rolling stone road tripper, we want you to spend less time searching and
more time playing. Simplify the search, use MaTiFoLi.com.



How
did you come up with the name Matifoli?

Matifoli is short for MAKE TIME FOR LIFE. It
is pronounced MA-TEE-FOE-LEE. Matifoli.com came to the conclusion that too many people today need to make time for life! Many of us have lost perspective
of what is important. We spend so much time worrying about money and working
long days that we forget to go out and enjoy ourselves and the people and
places around us. Do us a favour, put things into perspective for a second and
realize that the only thing that is concrete in this life is that you only have
this one life to live. If all you do is work and you don’t take the time to
step back and asses what is important to you, you could end up one day full of
regret because you never actually lived at all.

                ""If you don't take the chance to live life, what can you say at the end of it?"" Naveen Andrews



We are not saying don’t work, but rather to simply
take some time to productively enjoy your time when you're not working. Take
some time to try new things, have fun with family and friends and enjoy the
simple the things in life. The world is full of amazing locations and
experiences, treat yourself to some fun every once in a while!

What
else does MaTiFoLi.com offer as a company?

We are attempting to be different in every
way. A significant part of what we do as a company is share the gift of fun
with others. What this means is that we are hoping to, on a weekly basis, give
deserving individuals or families the gift of recreation. Our plan is to have
small giveaways on our Facebook
page where people can win the chance to enjoy the gift of recreation either for themselves or people they know that may deserve a break. We are going to start off small, but
with your help and support we will be able to increase the reach and volume of
the gifts with every passing week. 

As a kick off for MaTiFoLi.com, the company
had the privilege of surprising a deserving family that tragically lost their
mother, daughter and sister to cancer in late 2014 with a family vacation to
San Diego, California. It was more of a unique and fulfilling experience than
anyone can imagine and made us realize that there is amazing, positive people
everywhere you look. With the help of the extremely talented band The Soots, a
couple gift cards from Dave Strano, owner of Burrito Boyz in London Ontario and
Sue Coleman, owner of Thai Cuisine in London Ontario, and detailed trip
planning provided by Sue Richard of Robert Q in London Ontario, Matifoli.com
was able to truly make a difference in a deserving families life, all in the memory
of their loved one Mel. 

Our goal at Matifoli.com is to take half of
our company profits and give the gift of fun to as many deserving families and
individuals as we can; we want to show people that there is more important
things than money, something that many corporations and governments have lost
sight of. We also wish to show people that there is still positivity in this
world even though the news never really mentions it anymore.

Since MaTiFoLi.com is attempting to stay away
from typical investors, it will allow the company to share profits with our
users and followers and their friends and acquaintances rather than have an obligation
to share profits with shareholders and investors. 

What will
MaTiFoLi.com do with the money raised in the crowd-funding campaign?

All of the money raised will either directly
or indirectly go towards Matifoli.com's users, either through website improvements or giving back to the community.

Our goal is to invest some of the money into
marketing and data entry to improve the usability of the site. Simply put, we
need content!! At first we may need to add some content ourselves but hopefully
in time, users will begin to add their own.

After the initial direct investment in the
company, the remaining funds raised will be going towards gifts that will be
given away on our social networking pages. We are hoping to use up to 50
percent of the funds raised to give back to people in communities around North
America and beyond.

If you or someone you know wish to promote
your recreationally focused business or activity by donating gift cards or
experiences to give away on our social pages, please contact us at
admin@matifoli.com. To us, recreation is everything people do outside of work. If
our definition of recreation encompasses your activity, please do not hesitate
to contact us!

As
the CEO of Matifoli.com, what are your hopes for the future of the company?

I have always been a problem solver so my
hope for Matifoli.com is that it can help people enjoy their lives with greater
fulfillment. I hope that it can help people pursue their dreams, experience new
things, create lasting memories, make new friends, experience new cultures,
step out of their comfort zones, and most importantly HAVE FUN! There is so
much out there to experience, even in your own city, the difficult part can be
finding those experiences, and that is the problem I hope to solve. How can you
help Matifoli.com?

If you've read this far I'm sure you have
gathered what we kindly need from you. Most importantly we need you to, using
Matifoli.com, share, find and experience recreation as much as possible! It is
time as a global population to appreciate the privilege of life and not waste
it.
The other thing we kindly ask of you is to
help our cause by donating to the company what you can. As mentioned before, we
are trying to be unique in the ways we create our global brand by starting with

<p></p>

Jackson, a world traveler hitchhikes his way to New York, where he gets a ride with the beautiful, yet impulsive, Paige, who is running away. Together, as two lost and wounded souls, they find consolation in each other.  This is a film about finding yourself, and how sometimes a stranger can help you let go of your past.</p>

An active name in Indian Theater Arts, TV and Films, Mr. Amit Shrivastava, since his childhood, cherished being an artist following his father’s footsteps and guidance.  Still in process to establish himself as a renowned Producer in USA, Mr. Shrivastava likes to collaborate with filmmakers who are not afraid to take risks, those, whose undefeatable belief is their motivation, who hosts powerhouse artistry, reaching at the top of their fields. Amit Shrivastava enjoys helping to sculpt this ambitious work and articulate its heart and spirit, and considers it as an honor to work alongside a cast and crew of this caliber. This abridged preview staging was only the beginning, and we're all hoping that an even more vast and ambitious version will be mounted soon. 
Nick Grau, Producer

Nick works in the New York Television/Film industry as an Assistant Director, primarily on independent feature films.  Currently a resident of Brooklyn, he was born and raised in upstate New York, and he frequently chooses to set films there. In ""Wanderlust"", two strangers share a peculiarly intimate experience due to a complete isolation that comes from being on the road, against a backdrop of utter wilderness. Nick's affinity for finding locations in upstate New York was a perfect match for such a film. 
Juan Pablo Tramujas, Sound Mixer






Juan Pablo was born in Argentina and raised in Brazil. Sound has always been a big part of his life through music. Juan Pablo played the saxophone, jazz flute and sang in bands all the way through college when he graduated in Advertising. In 2010 he moved toNew York City to study filmmaking. Having the musical background, it felt natural for him to explore the world of sound for film. Since graduating, Juan Pablo worked on over 40 short films and 6 feature films that included talent like Harvey Keitel, Stephen Baldwin, Sean Young and William Forsythe. 
Melanie Coffey, Production Assistant






Melanie is currently a student, studying film at Long Island University, Post with a focus in writing, directing, and producing. She has studied film and television production in Philadelphia, London, and New York.

<h3><u>What this is about</u></h3>
<p><a href=""http://yfukada.wixsite.com/portfolio/ingiegogo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">日本語版はこちら</a></p>
<p>This is a crowdfunding campaign for a sci-fi short film, ""Perfect World."" We have already completed everything from the principal photography to the 5.1 Sound Mix, but <u>we need some help to finish the VFX due to the complexity of its process.</u></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><u>Story</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong><i>""PERFECT WORLD"" is a dystopian sci-fi drama short film that challenges our intolerance for other people's imperfections, despite the flaws that make us all human.​</i></strong></p>
<p><i>In 2121, where everything is captured as data, Citizens in the CITY are judged based on a score of one's efficiency, called a SPEC. An abortionist, Doctor K, faces a question between the law and morality when faced with a visit by his ex-lover Grace, who is pregnant.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><i>This story is inspired by true stories </i></u></p>
<p>As someone born with a mild physical handicap (a twisted foot), Yuske, the Director of this project, cannot forget the moment where his grandfather told him not to do too much physical work because he was <i>imperfect</i>. Since his foot was 99% cured by then, he was confused and shocked by how other people judge him, although he did understand the grandfather meant to care about his health and future. Through his life, he occasionally experienced judgemental gaze from others and it became a major source of inspiration for this project.</p>

This is a crowdfunding campaign for a sci-fi short film, ""Perfect World."" We have already completed everything from the principal photography to the 5.1 Sound Mix, but we need some help to finish the VFX due to the complexity of its process.
 
Story
""PERFECT WORLD"" is a dystopian sci-fi drama short film that challenges our intolerance for other people's imperfections, despite the flaws that make us all human.​
In 2121, where everything is captured as data, Citizens in the CITY are judged based on a score of one's efficiency, called a SPEC. An abortionist, Doctor K, faces a question between the law and morality when faced with a visit by his ex-lover Grace, who is pregnant.
 
This story is inspired by true stories 
As someone born with a mild physical handicap (a twisted foot), Yuske, the Director of this project, cannot forget the moment where his grandfather told him not to do too much physical work because he was imperfect. Since his foot was 99% cured by then, he was confused and shocked by how other people judge him, although he did understand the grandfather meant to care about his health and future. Through his life, he occasionally experienced judgemental gaze from others and it became a major source of inspiration for this project.

 
Our SYSTEM
To tell the story as accurately as possible, we are working on complete integrity between the theme and the visual language of the film. And what we tried to achieve visually is the world where everything is captured as data for the sake of the optimization and perfection of the efficiency in human life.
 
- What's unique about this project
In order to accomplish this concept, we chose Microsoft Kinect.  Kinect captures the position data of people and objects with infra-red, and provides it as depth data. And we decided to visualize this data as Point Cloud, like in the picture below.
And I thought the texture of this Point Cloud imagery was ideal to tell the story about the characters who struggle between PERFECTION vs IMPERFECTION, and to visualize human being as something that contains noise and glitches.

Here's a video where we talk about our setup.

This setup using the Kinect to capture the whole world (the set + actors) is exactly what I imagined this world should be. So we built a the system with the captured data from 3 Kinects along with color information from the RED.

 
What's already done
1) Development through Production
After developing the concept with Sam Ziaie (Concept Designer), and the script with Anthony Rettenmaier (Story Consultant) and Tulica Singh (Dialogue Consultant), we successfully finished our principal photography despite the complication of the setup with three Kinects, a RED, and two Iconix camera (small webcam like camera attached to Kinect); thanks to our great producers, Aaron Bush, Sara Fenton and Megan McDonnell, as well as Toshihiko Kizu (DP), Laura Cechanowicz (Production Designer), and the Kinect Team led by Enrico Targetti and many many more as you can see in pictures below! 

 
2) Editing & 5.1 Sound Mix
We already locked our picture by our editor, Meibei Lieu, and our 5.1 Mix was completed by Peter Bawiec. 3) Concept Art & Some VFXWe have some versions of backgrounds and point cloud shots with and by Jiayuan Liu (Concept Artist), Martin Tsuai (VFX Artist), and Production Designer/World Builder Laura Cechanowicz.Here's a work-in-progress image of a set. The point cloud data from three Kinect look like this. Different colors indicate data from different angles.Test renderings.and VR tests... (monoscopic 360 video, although we already proved stereoscopic 360 is working with our setup.)  
What still nees to be done
1) VFX (more Point Cloud)
Among 67 point cloud shots, 39 have been started and waiting for the finish up, but other 28 shots still need to be taken care of.
2) VR shots
The biggest advantage of this setup is that our captured data is, by default, ready for recreation in virtual 3D space. So technically we can rebuild everything that happened in the real world during the shoot in the virtual world in post production. As some of you who are familiar with technology may have noticed already, this set up is perfectly ready for a stereoscopic 360 VR experience. 
We are planning to generate 3 VR setups (scenes), and 2 have been started and proved to be functioning, but 1 is yet to be started.
 
Perfect World TeamA world set in the virtual doesn't mean we don't exist in the real world... What we needWe need support for the following reasons.As presented above, we're done with everything BUT the VFX and VR, although we already have designs, and all of our workflows are proven to work - including the point cloud shots, the most exciting part of this project, that I show and explain below. We just did not have enough man power, and computational power, to complete everything faster within our resources. The fact that we're using a customized workflow with a lot of experiments made it very difficult to find a suitable artist with experience, knowledge, curiosity and working rate.So, we need your help. The numbers are listed below.

What we can offer as returns are the following:
1) Movie (of course!)
2) Stereoscopic 360 VR shots
2) Credit (Executive Producer/Associate Producer/Special Thanks)
3) Props & Costumes
 
Risks & ChallengesWe are proud that we made our grand design possible despite the complexity and innovative approach to the audio-visual storytelling, but  the time is our biggest concern and risk. The quality will likely be compromised to reduce time without your support. Other Ways You Can HelpSharing and Liking on any social media or in your daily conversation with friends DOES help! Just to make it super duper clear...I understand the fund asked here is not small - you may say ""I could make one short film with that budget!"" Yes that may be true.

</div></div>","Short Summary
 My name is Shauna Richardson and I'm an actress and writer based out of SF and LA. I've had the pleasure of working on several television shows, feature films, and commercials.
 Our goal with this campaign is to get the necessary funding in order to create a beautiful film. This short film is all about showcasing the every day life and how our relationships can thrive and struggle when faced with hardship. This film explores the lives of a married couple who have to face some harsh realities after a tragedy takes place in their lives. We have all dealt with tragedy, with loss, and with the hard task of picking up the broken pieces and moving forward. We want to capture that. This campaign is so important to us because it will allow us to create the best film possible, and hopefully, in turn, touch many viewers. We want to bring this short film to the festival circuit both nationally and internationally and believe that with the right execution and creative process, it will find success.
 Your contribution would make this film possible. We want people to be as passionate about this story as we are. We want to bring the authenticity and rawness of every day life back to the screen. We want our audience to walk away with questions and not just answers. Our goal is not to just create a film but to actually connect with viewers around the world through these characters. Your contribution will help us achieve that goal. 
Below, underneath our cast, are some links that will take you to some of the pages we've already created for the film so you can get the first peak at what we've done so far!

   What We Need & What You Get For this to happen we are asking for $2,000. It may seem like a lot. And it is. But it truly takes a village to create a wonderful short film.

The Impact We think our project is valuable and stands out because of the intention and meaning behind it. The world of film has grown so much in the last decade as has the technology within it. All of that is great. However, we really want to create a simple, organic story with a simple idea. This film aims to tackle many situations we face in life whether it's loss, love, grief, happiness, or sorrow. We want every person that views this film to be able to relate to what they are seeing.

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>We have, over the past four years, developed a robust,
honest working relationship which we have benefitted from in our time making
films together. Before now we have always been based in horror, and thrill, but
we believe this mainly to be a reflection of our growing selves. With a
background in horror, a costume intensive art, with a lot of time dedicated to
placement of camera and shot composition gives us many of the skills necessary to
create a creature costume fantasy. </p>
<p>Elsewhere is, by contrast a far more uplifting film, though
it is anchored in reality. This fresh tone and theme for the both of us is a
welcome change, but we also feel that it is a reflection of us becoming happier
in ourselves: from becoming more realistic with life, and expectations.</p>

<h3>The Story</h3> <p></p>
<p>“I am
an Arab volunteer, I
came to Spain to defend Cairo in Barcelona, Damascus in Toledo and Baghdad in
Madrid.” Najati Sidki (in 1936).</p>
<p>Imagine
that your father is a Palestinian Arab, but he had decided to fight against Franco
in Spanish Civil War. Imagine that you have siblings, but you can’t talk with
them because you don’t speak the same language. Imagine that you have a family
but you were raised without parents... </p>
<p>“You Come
From Far Away” tells the extraordinary story of a Palestinian family: the
father, Najati Sidki, was a Palestinian communist who came to Spain as a
volunteer to fight against Franco in 1936. The family was dispersed by several turmoils
that steer the last century starting by the Spanish Civil War, and goes on with
World War II, Nakba, Lebanese Civil War, etc. As if the 20th century was summed
up in the life of a single family. Dulia (Dawlat in Arabic), the eldest
daughter, was lost in Russia after the Spanish Civil War and separated from the
family for 20 years. </p>
<p>The film
also remind us the fact that the Arabs were fighting for the future of European
people long before they become unwanted refugees at its borders. Najati Sidki
was one of those unknown Arab heroes who paid a high price for his decision.</p>
<p></p>

<p>History
usually has associated the Arabs’ role in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939)
with the Moroccan troops who were brought to Spain by Franco in order to fight
against the Republicans’ government. This image has predominated during the
last decades, overshadowing the other Arabs’ existence among the international
volunteers.</p>
<p>In fact,
more than one thousand people had come from Iraq, Morocco, Lebanon, Palestine,
Egypt, Algeria, etc. in order to defend the Republic and democracy against
Franco. Some of them were killed or disappeared just like other comrades in
Madrid, Aragón, Andalusia and Catalonia, while others returned to their
countries after the war.</p>
<p>Who were
those Arabs? Why did they come to fight and to die defending democracy in a
distant country? The documentary tries to answer these questions, through the
story of Najati Sidki, a Palestinian journalist and the former secretary of the
Palestine Communist Party.</p>

<p>The
historical research of the story is already done with the support of Fundación
Euroárabe, based in Granada. “You Come From Far Away” is selected also among
the projects, which are going to be supported by Screen Institute Beirut. 50%
of the filming is already done. However, the existing budget is far from

 نحتاج إلى دعمك لاستكمال الفيلم الذي يحكي القصة غير العادية لنجاتي صدقي وعائلته

النص باللغة العربية(Trailer y texto en español más abajo)
The Story 
“I am
an Arab volunteer, I
came to Spain to defend Cairo in Barcelona, Damascus in Toledo and Baghdad in
Madrid.” Najati Sidki (in 1936).
Imagine
that your father is a Palestinian Arab, but he had decided to fight against Franco
in Spanish Civil War. Imagine that you have siblings, but you can’t talk with
them because you don’t speak the same language. Imagine that you have a family
but you were raised without parents... 
“You Come
From Far Away” tells the extraordinary story of a Palestinian family: the
father, Najati Sidki, was a Palestinian communist who came to Spain as a
volunteer to fight against Franco in 1936. The family was dispersed by several turmoils
that steer the last century starting by the Spanish Civil War, and goes on with
World War II, Nakba, Lebanese Civil War, etc. As if the 20th century was summed
up in the life of a single family. Dulia (Dawlat in Arabic), the eldest
daughter, was lost in Russia after the Spanish Civil War and separated from the
family for 20 years. 
The film
also remind us the fact that the Arabs were fighting for the future of European
people long before they become unwanted refugees at its borders. Najati Sidki
was one of those unknown Arab heroes who paid a high price for his decision.



Background

History
usually has associated the Arabs’ role in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939)
with the Moroccan troops who were brought to Spain by Franco in order to fight
against the Republicans’ government. This image has predominated during the
last decades, overshadowing the other Arabs’ existence among the international
volunteers.
In fact,
more than one thousand people had come from Iraq, Morocco, Lebanon, Palestine,
Egypt, Algeria, etc. in order to defend the Republic and democracy against
Franco. Some of them were killed or disappeared just like other comrades in
Madrid, Aragón, Andalusia and Catalonia, while others returned to their
countries after the war.
Who were
those Arabs? Why did they come to fight and to die defending democracy in a
distant country? The documentary tries to answer these questions, through the
story of Najati Sidki, a Palestinian journalist and the former secretary of the
Palestine Communist Party.



Why is your contribution important?

The
historical research of the story is already done with the support of Fundación
Euroárabe, based in Granada. “You Come From Far Away” is selected also among
the projects, which are going to be supported by Screen Institute Beirut. 50%
of the filming is already done. However, the existing budget is far from
covering the full production.
We need your
support in order to continue filming in Moscow, Beirut and Spain.
The film
will be completed in 2016.

</div></div>","Short Summary In this age of increasing entrepreneurship, art is more and more accessible. This is great news. We can choose to listen to whatever we want, watch whatever we want, and make whatever we want, instead of needing to rely on radios, TVs, or labels. We're all about that. 
We make the kind of music you can dance to. You can workout to. You can hang out to. We make positive music. Groovy music. VIBEY music. We want you to feel good! 
We're grabbing life by the horns on this next one. It's called ""Flipside"" and, with your help, it can get real crazy. I like making music, but my friends are the people who really turn this into something incredible. 
Our production team? They do things like cinematography and know about terms like ""Dutch angles"" and honestly, I'm not even prepared for what they have in store.
D'Angelo meets Trapstreet boys. It's turnt. Our boy Josh Zacher is doing the choreography, and he really doesn't mess around. 
The outfits?? Oh my god. 
We just like having fun making dope things. If that sounds like a good time to you, give us a shot. Join the Squad. Be the Squad. 
Love, 
Nic + the Squad   What We Need & What You Get The generous Tisch School of the Arts is providing us with most of the equipment package. However, we need $2000 to help us cover the cost of the following: 
- Equipment: Camera Package and Additional Lights- Trucking/Transportation of Equipment - Permits: Filming in NYC- Costumes and Props- Meals for the crew behind the camera 
    The Impact We have been lucky enough to know and grow up with so many talented people who aren't afraid to make the art that they want. In every community, there are people afraid to express themselves, artists who don't realize there are others like them. We want to encourage everyone to look within their communities and create something with someone else. It feels good. Let's work together more. That's what we're all about.
We really want to make music both intellectual and universal, something you can choose to dissect or just nod your head along to. ""Flipside"" is the embodiment of working together. In everything from the choreography to the lighting set-up, it's a melting pot of dancers, singers, producers, and visual artists all looking to meet one goal: inspire people while doing what we love, in the highest quality we can. 
    Risks & Challenges As with every film, we might run into some challenges. This could include technical issues with our equipment to entirely losing our shooting locations. Regardless, with the fiery determination of our hard-working team, we can resolve any of those issues. We've done it before.
Of course, our main obstacles right now lie in acquiring the funding necessary to make our dream a reality. At the end of the day, you are the one making this happen. We are very grateful for that.

Hello!

Who Are We?

We are the Bearded Dragon, A collection of filmmakers from throughout Oklahoma. We come from a multitude of backgrounds ranging in Film making to business. A few months ago we decided to embark on the adventure of creating a feature length horror film. 

Each of us has done our fair share of series, short films, and commercial. We decided to make this film cause one of our own, Nathaniel Davis, made a feature last year (He did this before the collective was conceived) and did most of the shooting casting and editing himself. Later he met another member of our crew, Mia Riddle, and pitched her the idea of doing an ""Out There"" horror film. With this film they wanted to create a movie that has great production value, and that was character driven.
 From there we accumulated more people on our team and thus The Bearded Dragon was born.


If We are Able to Raise the Funds for this Film


We will be able to have the high production value that we need and, with any luck, distribute the film to the masses. The dream is get it to film festivals every where.

We believe the funds will aide in our growth and will give us the ability to have a great production.

   Risks & Challenges

What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.  Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited! Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.    The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:  Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world. Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one). Make it real for people and build trust.    Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.  Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles. Describe your plan for solving these challenges.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Leanne began working with Albert after seeing his performance in 'Deeper than Yesterday', a film that has won many awards itself. Leanne saw one moment in the film where she thought Albert could do a drama role and wrote the short film 'Love in Motion' for him. Having successfully producing 'Love in Motion',<br/><br/>Leanne started writing another short film, however the feedback from fellow film makers that she gained after reading her drafts, encouraged her to increased the short film into a feature.  Albert asked to audition for the short film before it was completed and was sent a draft of the short film Twisted.

Develop a script that is solid. We are still working on the script atm to make sure we are ready to film. We don't intend to rush into filming which is a common mistake first time feature film makers make. We know it's going to be a long, hard process as most of us have worked on projects  that require a long commitment.<br/><br/>2. Assemble a team that is all working to the same goal. At this stage we have not completed our film team because we want to make sure everyone is on the same page and excited to be making the film. This is important because all decisions will be based on what is best for the film only.<br/><br/>3. Finding the right people to be in the film. It's always a challenge when you know a lot of actors who are friends to cast the right person for your film when friends want to work on it. We have chosen to use a panel of people for the auditions so that there is no question about the people that are cast are right for the film<br/><br/>4. Developing an audience. This is probably the most difficult aspect of a film. How can you develop and audience when they haven't seen the film. This crowdfunding campaign, the facebook page and the website will all be used to develop a presence and help people decide if this film project means something to them that they want to partner with us and be a part of the process. :-)<br/><br/>5. Securing quality locations for shooting. Each location must fit with the film to bring something of value to the project. We don't want to just use whatever we can get to make the film. It is important that all aspects of the film is strong.<br/><br/>6. The biggest challenge is how is my film of benefit to the people supporting the project. I would love to make sure that those who partner with us also feel valued and a part of the team<br/><br/><br/><i><a href=""http://theabf.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Brotherhood of Fathers</a> is a charity organisation to support father's and their right to be able to see their own children often in situations where the mother is unfit to care for her own children.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>How can one person's contribution have the most impact on the betterment of people's lives?</p>
<p>On World Vasectomy Day, taking place November 13, hundreds of doctors
 from more than 40 countries are going to perform thousands of 
vasectomies.</p>
<p>A vasectomy is a simple and cheap procedure that can literally turn a 
family's life around. With just $30 you're allowing someone to
 get a vasectomy, someone who might not otherwise have access to 
reliable birth control.<br/></p>
<p>By getting a vasectomy and having fewer children, men can give their
 families the chance to rise out of poverty. Smaller families also mean fewer resources are consumed and less pollution is produced. How much 
less? A whole lifetime's worth.
</p>That's quite an impact for a such a meager amount. <br/><br/><h3>Matching Donation</h3>
<p>The goal amount isn't there just for show. A donor has already committed to contributing another $5,000 to World Vasectomy Day if we manage to do our part.</p>
<p>Technically this means that <b>any amount you pledge is worth double</b>.<br/></p>
<h3>What is a Vasectomy?</h3>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FhN9tf3vHfqg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DhN9tf3vHfqg&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FhN9tf3vHfqg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p><b>Vasectomy</b> is a surgical procedure for male permanent contraception. During the procedure, the vasa deferentia are severed in a manner so as to prevent sperm
 from entering into the ejaculate. Vasectomies are usually performed in a physician's 
office or medical clinic. The procedure is 
not complicated, the incisions small, and the necessary equipment 
routine.</p>

<p>Due its simplicity, a vasectomy usually takes less than
thirty minutes. After a short recovery at the doctor's office, the patient is
sent home. Because the procedure is minimally invasive, many vasectomy patients
can resume their typical sexual behavior within a week.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>All funds from this campaign are sent directly to World Vasectomy Day, which is a USA non-profit. The money will be used to produce the event that engages with men and providers around the globe. It will be used to spark conversation and ignite men to action for the benefit of themselves, their families, and the planet. </p>
<p>If enough funds are available, World Vasectomy Day intends to expand the scope of the event to include more countries. Want your country to join in? We do too.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444244590/s4nodggkjpydhdmrgyub.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are asking each of you to give what you can. If you give $30 that's about the cost for each WVD inspired vasectomy.  The event costs $120,000 and we expect to do 4,000 vasectomies. That’s $30 each. What does that mean? Well, for a man who had never thought to get a vasectomy, it might mean saving his wife’s life or making it easier to help his children emerge from poverty or it might lower carbon footprint 28 times more than a lifetime of recycling, reducing or reusing. In fact, I can't think of a more positive way to make a significant impact.<br/></p>
<p>In exchange, you have our sincerest gratitude. We are a small team working hard because we really believe in this mission, and every little bit helps. Check out the perks we offer. <br/></p>
<h3>$5 - Thank you for your generous contribution!</h3>
<p>This may not seem like much, but every little bit gets us closer to our goal and gives men around the globe the opportunity to get a vasectomy for their own future as well as the future of their family and their community. For that we will send you a special Thank You email from the WVD 2015 team.            </p>

</div>
<p>Here is an overview of our origin, vision and success from co-founder, Jonathan Stack:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>During my life, I had witnessed two seemingly contradictory
truths.  Truth one, there are a lot of
frustrated and angry young men on this planet who easily gravitate to violence.
Truth two, these same men, when encouraged to express their best selves and given
the conditions to do so, choose the positive over the negative almost every
time. </p>
<p>We often hear that men don’t get vasectomies, and while in some
places that’s sadly true, we also noted that what one man fears to do alone, he
will not hesitate to take on when standing amongst a band of brothers. </p>
<p>So in 2013, I created World Vasectomy Day as a way to aggregate
individual acts of love into a collective global movement for good. In year one,
with a few friends, little resources but a lot of passion, we inspired over 150
doctors in 25 countries to do almost 1000 vasectomies in 24 hours.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443897779/tqmhq9afrttufo2ns2sc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Seeing the potential for success, for WVD, 2014, we set out to
involve the global health community, and with Planned Parenthood, Marie Stopes
International and many others, we partnered with almost 500 doctors in 32

<p>We believe men are ready to make the choice to do right by themselves, their families and our future by becoming engaged in a conversation about family planning.

</div></div>","Short Summary How can one person's contribution have the most impact on the betterment of people's lives?
On World Vasectomy Day, taking place November 13, hundreds of doctors
 from more than 40 countries are going to perform thousands of 
vasectomies.
A vasectomy is a simple and cheap procedure that can literally turn a 
family's life around. With just $30 you're allowing someone to
 get a vasectomy, someone who might not otherwise have access to 
reliable birth control.
By getting a vasectomy and having fewer children, men can give their
 families the chance to rise out of poverty. Smaller families also mean fewer resources are consumed and less pollution is produced. How much 
less? A whole lifetime's worth.
That's quite an impact for a such a meager amount. Matching Donation
The goal amount isn't there just for show. A donor has already committed to contributing another $5,000 to World Vasectomy Day if we manage to do our part.
Technically this means that any amount you pledge is worth double.
What is a Vasectomy?

Vasectomy is a surgical procedure for male permanent contraception. During the procedure, the vasa deferentia are severed in a manner so as to prevent sperm
 from entering into the ejaculate. Vasectomies are usually performed in a physician's 
office or medical clinic. The procedure is 
not complicated, the incisions small, and the necessary equipment 
routine.

                         


                                    
Due its simplicity, a vasectomy usually takes less than
thirty minutes. After a short recovery at the doctor's office, the patient is
sent home. Because the procedure is minimally invasive, many vasectomy patients
can resume their typical sexual behavior within a week.





Read more on Wikipedia.
  What We Need & What You Get All funds from this campaign are sent directly to World Vasectomy Day, which is a USA non-profit. The money will be used to produce the event that engages with men and providers around the globe. It will be used to spark conversation and ignite men to action for the benefit of themselves, their families, and the planet. 
If enough funds are available, World Vasectomy Day intends to expand the scope of the event to include more countries. Want your country to join in? We do too.


We are asking each of you to give what you can. If you give $30 that's about the cost for each WVD inspired vasectomy.  The event costs $120,000 and we expect to do 4,000 vasectomies. That’s $30 each. What does that mean? Well, for a man who had never thought to get a vasectomy, it might mean saving his wife’s life or making it easier to help his children emerge from poverty or it might lower carbon footprint 28 times more than a lifetime of recycling, reducing or reusing. In fact, I can't think of a more positive way to make a significant impact.
In exchange, you have our sincerest gratitude. We are a small team working hard because we really believe in this mission, and every little bit helps. Check out the perks we offer. 
$5 - Thank you for your generous contribution!
This may not seem like much, but every little bit gets us closer to our goal and gives men around the globe the opportunity to get a vasectomy for their own future as well as the future of their family and their community.

included on a World Vasectomy Day banner that will fly at this year's 
International Conference on Family Planning in Bali.

Remember, every little bit counts. This is your chance to make a meaningful impact.
    The Impact
We believe the world needs World Vasectomy Day. Here's why:
 

Here is an overview of our origin, vision and success from co-founder, Jonathan Stack:


During my life, I had witnessed two seemingly contradictory
truths.  Truth one, there are a lot of
frustrated and angry young men on this planet who easily gravitate to violence.
Truth two, these same men, when encouraged to express their best selves and given
the conditions to do so, choose the positive over the negative almost every
time. 
We often hear that men don’t get vasectomies, and while in some
places that’s sadly true, we also noted that what one man fears to do alone, he
will not hesitate to take on when standing amongst a band of brothers. 
So in 2013, I created World Vasectomy Day as a way to aggregate
individual acts of love into a collective global movement for good. In year one,
with a few friends, little resources but a lot of passion, we inspired over 150
doctors in 25 countries to do almost 1000 vasectomies in 24 hours.


Seeing the potential for success, for WVD, 2014, we set out to
involve the global health community, and with Planned Parenthood, Marie Stopes
International and many others, we partnered with almost 500 doctors in 32
countries who performed close to 3000 vasectomies. We were already the largest male
oriented family planning event in history when India declared it an official day.

If year one’s theme was ‘lowering carbon footprint one vasectomy
at a time’ and year two was ‘celebrating responsible men’, the theme for World
Vasectomy Day 2015 will be ACTS OF LOVE. 
Our goal, 750 doctors, 4,000 vasectomies, 40 countries and a
strong and vocal presence at this year’s International Conference of Family
Planning to be held in Bali, November 9 – 12. It is our chance to show all the
major players in the field the possibility of overcoming the impossible.    Risks & Challenges 

As of writing this, there are 33 days left before our team heads out to Bali. As of
today, I have no sponsorship deals, no corporate underwriting, no grant and no
foundation money.  A number of
individuals have donated generously and our own Dr. Doug Stein has offered a
matching fund. To make our dream come true and never have to look back again
with regrets on what might have been, we need to raise another $50,000. This campaign is one of our efforts towards reaching this goal.

We can't do it alone. I need you guys out there to help me by donating, by sharing and by spreading the voice about this year's goal for WVD.
We will get there and that's just the beginning.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">WHAT MAKES THIS FILM SPECIAL?</h2>
<p><strong>Wonderkind is a powerful film.</strong> There are those works of art that inspire us to look deep inside ourselves and discover new strengths and places to grow; inspires us to hold on to faith in unseen things, to dare to hope, and about the curious power of belief. Wonderkind is exactly that sort of film, offering us the chance to look at ourselves and what we are are, in a brand new light.</p>
<p><strong>It's DIFFERENT.</strong> It's not often that themes offering deep introspection about the human condition, theories on ""metascience"", telekinetic abilities, superhuman speed, substance abuse, grief, and childlike faith can ALL fit into one film, and do so in perfect harmony!</p>
<p><strong>It's BOLD. </strong>The story explores all these themes faithfully and truthfully. It's a roller-coaster experience, with plot twists and turns all throughout, and treacherous danger at every point. Sometimes the story takes us to dark places, before the hope shines through. </p>
<p><strong>It's NEW.</strong> To our knowledge, and we believe you'll agree even after the first few scenes, we can't think of a movie that's ever been made like this. Though some critics who saw the full first draft made a few mentions of M. Night Shamalayan's <i>Unbreakable </i>(a fair comparison), there's still a vast difference in style, story, character, and aesthetic between the two. We trust that when we say nothing quite like this has been done before, no one will ever leave a theater skeptical about that claim.</p>
<p><strong>It's GOOD.</strong> None of the above matters, if the film isn't well-made, or the story wasn't worth telling. It is, on both counts.</p>

</div></div>","THE 'WONDERKIND' STORY

After his mother commits suicide, Logan Fairchild refuses to accept that she is dead. Imagining that both she and he are superhumans, he claims she faked her death. 
 
Two years after, Luke, his closet-alcoholic father, takes him to counseling, concerned about his delusions. Luke also forbids him to go near his estranged brother-in-law, Logan's uncle Roman, who Luke believes fosters his paranormal delusions.
 
As Logan appears to be accepting that his mother is gone, Luke takes him on a weekend getaway to the family's cabin in the mountains. After Roman commits a violent crime and escapes into the woods, a series of bizarre, supernatural events occur, and Luke and Logan are pulled into a bizarre and treacherous conflict.
 
THE 2-MINUTE TEASER
The first 1:55 of the Wonderkind film. Luke remembers flashes of his tragic final night with Olivia.
 


 

WHO IS THE BIMACULATE?
Solomon Voegel, Roman's ex-comrade and a mercenary in the employ of the IIC, appears in the final scenes of the film to confront and ultimate kill Roman, Logan's uncle. The Bimaculate has more abilities than Roman, and he is twice as powerful.
 
The Bimaculate, The Extractor, swarms of IIC agents, and Solara Vanderweiss hinder Roman and the Fairchilds' escape from the clutches of the agency. They will stop at nothing to bring in 0-3-1-1 (Logan), and eliminate anyone who stands in their way, including his family.
 


 

 

      

 


WHAT MAKES THIS FILM SPECIAL?
Wonderkind is a powerful film. There are those works of art that inspire us to look deep inside ourselves and discover new strengths and places to grow; inspires us to hold on to faith in unseen things, to dare to hope, and about the curious power of belief. Wonderkind is exactly that sort of film, offering us the chance to look at ourselves and what we are are, in a brand new light.
It's DIFFERENT. It's not often that themes offering deep introspection about the human condition, theories on ""metascience"", telekinetic abilities, superhuman speed, substance abuse, grief, and childlike faith can ALL fit into one film, and do so in perfect harmony!
It's BOLD. The story explores all these themes faithfully and truthfully. It's a roller-coaster experience, with plot twists and turns all throughout, and treacherous danger at every point. Sometimes the story takes us to dark places, before the hope shines through. 
It's NEW. To our knowledge, and we believe you'll agree even after the first few scenes, we can't think of a movie that's ever been made like this. Though some critics who saw the full first draft made a few mentions of M. Night Shamalayan's Unbreakable (a fair comparison), there's still a vast difference in style, story, character, and aesthetic between the two. We trust that when we say nothing quite like this has been done before, no one will ever leave a theater skeptical about that claim.
It's GOOD. None of the above matters, if the film isn't well-made, or the story wasn't worth telling. It is, on both counts.
 
Once this film is done, YOU WILL HAVE TAKEN PART IN SOMETHING HUGE!
 
       
 
WHAT'S YOUR BUDGET?

 
AND WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?
 
We will be filming in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and then in Broken Bow, Oklahoma for 5-6 days in mid February (2017). Immediately after, we will edit the new scene and new footage into the final cut of the film, and make simultaneous submissions to Cannes, Sundance, and Toronto.

Having recorded and performed with such artists as Paquito D'Rivera, Chino Maurice, Michele Rosewoman, Lauryn Hill, Michael Phillip Mossman,  Zé Luis Oliveira, Benny Reid, Antonio Hart, Will Calhoun, José José, Tony DeSare, Fabio Morgera, Francis Mbappe, Stacy Dillard and other artists of many genres has reinforced his versatility and made him a growing influence in the New York music scene.</span></p>
<span><p>Richard was born in Havana, Cuba in 1982, emigrated to Miami in 1988 and lived there until 2003.  Although the only musician in the family, there was an overabundance of both music and support.  Growing up listening to Beny Moré, Fernando Alvarez, Tchaikovsky, Irakere and Billie Holiday instilled within him a musical appreciation from an early age that would later provide a rich musical foundation to draw from.</p>
<p>At the age of 12, Richard began playing guitar and attended the prestigious New World School of the Arts in Miami, where he began formal conservatory training when he was 16. Before graduating he began playing with some of Miami's most reputable musicians and ensembles such as Ira Sullivan, Othello Mollineaux, Gary Campbell, For If the Flies and Carlos Averhoff.  Intuitively utilizing his musical heritage as well as the musical diversity Miami had to offer, he developed a unique style of both playing and composing.  Drawing from many genres he breathes new life into the guitar and brings an inventive approach to his compositions.

The challenges facing individuals trying to overcome the acts of violence committed towards them and their loved ones can be challenges that lead to more violence and crime. 
MEET THE TEAM

  
MARA LEE GILBERT (writer, producer, lead actress)

Mara is an actress/writer/producer living in New York City.  She has a Master’s in Forensic Psychology from John Jay College of Criminal Justice – an area of study she draws upon often in her writing and performing; and very specifically for this project, being inspired by her ten years of work counseling and teaching teens and adults housed in some of New York City's most restricted facilities.
Currently, Mara is also producing a one-act play, PASSAGE, which she wrote and will star in which will premiere with the New York New Works Theatre Festival. This festival connects the next wave of industry writing talent with current leaders of broadway and television production. nynwtheatrefestival.com 
She has also been commissioned to write a feature-length script project with a budget of $2.7 million to be spear-headed by one of Hollywood's established producers (details are not yet available for release).
Her one-act play, Steel or Pretzels, was chosen as one of the best plays of the Strawberry One-Act Festival of 2009 and is published in volume 6 of their anthology, The Best Plays of the Strawberry One-Act Festival. Her poetry has been published in John Jay’s Finest, volume 22 – a yearly publication showcasing the best student work for that year at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. She has also been published as the forward to well-known NY poet, Douglas Rothschild’s, recent collection: The Minor Arcana, which closes out his latest book of poetry, Theogony.

JOHN BRODSKY (producer, lead actor)

John's last project, DAY 39, in which he stars, is currently a finalist of the student short films being considered for an Academy Award Nomination. www.day39film.com
He was born in Montclair, NJ and raised in Rumson, NJ. After singing most of his life in competitions, choirs, and bands John found that his musical talents could only take him so far. Not to be discouraged, a fellow band mate introduced him to an acting teacher and John was hooked. After studying in New Jersey on and off for a couple of years, John decided to leave college behind and pursue acting full time professionally in New York City.
After only a few short months of auditioning, John landed a co-starring role on Law & Order: Criminal Intent. In addition, John has worked on many short films, with directors ranging from Columbia University to NYU, with two films going to the Cannes Film Festival. Recently he got the chance to work with TINA FEY in the film, ADMISSION directed by Paul Wietz. In addition to acting, John loves networking and collaborating on projects with fellow actors, film makers, and musicians; discussing what it means to be an artist and navigate through “The Business.”
He is looking forward to pursuing more independent film opportunities, and is currently studying with Sean Folster in his Craft Gym Program. View more here: www.JohnBrodsky.com



JAMES REES (director)



James moved up to New York five years ago after being a pastor for three years. He has a background in the arts and after a hiatus, decided it was time to give it a go. As an actor, he has appeared Off-Broadway in Measure for Measure (Shakespeare in the Park) and in The Killer (Theatre for a New Audience). Directing WHAT'S LEFT was dream come true, as directing has always been a passion for him.
Currently James is starring in and producing a production of Mike Bartlett's play, BULL, to be performed the last two weekends of August at the Alchemical Theatre Laboratory on 14th St in Manhattan. BULL is a play about 3 co-workers who are awaiting a meeting with their boss, after which, one will be let go. It deals with the mind games that are played between them. At its core, it's an unflinching look at what bullying is in an adult context. It's a hard hitting hour of theatre.

ALEXANDER CROWE (director of photography)
Alexander is an award-winning cinematographer with his short film, ABIGAIL, taking second place at the Cannes Film Festival, 2012. This short is also a Staff Pick of what to watch on Vimeo.

RICHARD PADRON (composer)


SAMPLE OF MUSIC FOR WHAT'S LEFT: https://soundcloud.com/richard-padron/dreams-are-real
Richard Padrón is a guitarist and composer living and working in New York City. Having recorded and performed with such artists as Paquito D'Rivera, Chino Maurice, Michele Rosewoman, Lauryn Hill, Michael Phillip Mossman,  Zé Luis Oliveira, Benny Reid, Antonio Hart, Will Calhoun, José José, Tony DeSare, Fabio Morgera, Francis Mbappe, Stacy Dillard and other artists of many genres has reinforced his versatility and made him a growing influence in the New York music scene.
Richard was born in Havana, Cuba in 1982, emigrated to Miami in 1988 and lived there until 2003.  Although the only musician in the family, there was an overabundance of both music and support.  Growing up listening to Beny Moré, Fernando Alvarez, Tchaikovsky, Irakere and Billie Holiday instilled within him a musical appreciation from an early age that would later provide a rich musical foundation to draw from.
At the age of 12, Richard began playing guitar and attended the prestigious New World School of the Arts in Miami, where he began formal conservatory training when he was 16. Before graduating he began playing with some of Miami's most reputable musicians and ensembles such as Ira Sullivan, Othello Mollineaux, Gary Campbell, For If the Flies and Carlos Averhoff.  Intuitively utilizing his musical heritage as well as the musical diversity Miami had to offer, he developed a unique style of both playing and composing.  Drawing from many genres he breathes new life into the guitar and brings an inventive approach to his compositions.

<p>Welcome to Virtual Revolution's crowdfunding page! Here you will have the opportunity to be a part of our adventure, by helping us making a gritty, dirty sci-fi feature film about a dystopia where entertainment in general, and virtual reality in particular, have become a new way of life...</p>

<br/>Virtual Revolution is a sci-fi feature, which could be described as cyberpunk. An interesting definition of cyberpunk is: 'High Tech, Low Life'. Most cyberpunk stories are dystopias set in our future, and they tend to raise questions that our societies will have to deal with in several years, decades, or centuries.<br/><br/>
<p>Virtual Revolution is also a bit of tech noir, with some of the typical codes from noir films (the investigator, the Femme Fatale...etc), but in a European environment.</p>

<br/>Paris, 2047. Technology has progressed to the point where virtual reality has become as realistic as reality itself. But when you can be a hero, a legend, when you can pilot spaceships and discover new planets, ride horses against orks and conquer lands, board pirate ships and explore islands, when you can get fame, pleasure, and wealth without risks, what's the point in sticking to reality? <br/><br/>
<p>Paris, 2047. 75% of the population spend all their time online, and don't care anymore about reality anymore. They are the Connected. Some have decided to stick to reality. The wealthy, mainly, since real life has reamined pretty comfortable for them. But also other people, for various reasons. Philosophical, religious, or just because what they do in life just matters to them more than virtual worlds. They are the Living. Finally, a small minority never could make a choice, spending half of their time connected, and the other half awake. They are the Hybrids.</p>

Gabriel's Messenger Ministries, Inc. is a ministry devoted 
completely to its goal of saving souls and changing lives through it's 
efforts to evangelize. ""Preach the gospel to the poor, proclaim release to the captives, recovery of sight to the blind, and to set free those who are oppressed""-Luke 4:18

GMM
 is run by Nicole Abisinio, a Faith Based Film Producer, Casting 
Director, public speaker, and Evangelist.  GMM is a nonprofit in process
 for its 501c3 status.  GMM will not receive ANY portion of this funding
 as we are doing this as
 a volunteer mission. 100% of money contributed to GMM's campaign will 
go to Lighthouse Catholic Media and Indiegogo for the New Testament 
Bibles and the crowd funding usage fees.  
The more we pool our resources together here for this endeavor, the 
less expensive each bible will be (dropping from 5 dollars to only 2.15 
per bible), and the more people in need will be gifted with God's word.

THIIS was significant in its ability to so subtly and powerfully pair the ways in which ordinary young lives connect to what is often seen as spectacular and out-of-the-ordinary political outbursts. Through the writing, photography and drawings of young thinkers, THIIS spoke of how love, sex, going to school, trying to find a job, parties and parents relate to the vast political troubles of our world.</p><p>Thought We Had Something Going is a collection of some of the most poignant posts over the 4 years of THIIS online magazine. As South Africa looks at 21 Years of Democracy through ever more jaded eyes, this book points clearly to how life goes on, broken but beautiful, and that freedom is something to be continuously sought – not born with.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">We launch the narrative called: THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING GOING or #TWHSG for the book and documentary.

<div style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">When Thando
Sangqu approached me out of the blue to write this Preface I was reluctant at
first. Many people ask me to write Prefaces for all sorts of things, just as
many others send me their unsolicited manuscripts, expecting me to attend to
them pronto. I have learned to turn down such requests; otherwise I would spend
all my life reading and commenting on other people’s writing instead of
attending to my own work. My first instinct then was to reject Thando’s
request. But when he outlined his purpose and objective, I was impressed by his
initiative and the clarity of his vision.</span></div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  This
anthology with contributions from a number of writers, photographers and
artists, he told me, aims to explore how young South Africans confront their
truths and their inner political struggles in quest of relevance. “The book
ultimately looks at how in a society that seeks so much validation in brand and
social affiliation that perhaps young people need to learn to be their own
greatest assets and favourite brand,” he added. “We launch this book in the
21st year of South Africa's democracy as I think it is important that we
finally ask the question: where to from here? We have neglected to confront our
truths and perhaps this book is that turning point for South Africa to wake up
by reading the socio-political musings of young people in the infancy of their
careers who have either just graduated or about to graduate.”</span></div>

<div style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">They write
facilely about sharing apartments in Clifton, about attending expensive private
high school, and about club-hopping and encounters with bouncers. In the same
breath they decry the combination of money and ego, and the sense of naivety
and entitlement that develops in young people of their social and economic
standing. </span></div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Sometimes a
writer reflects on the meaning of freedom in post-1994 South Africa. It is
telling that these writers talk of a “post ’94 South Africa” rather than
post-apartheid. The legacy of apartheid is still very strong in today’s South
Africa. In some instances it is not just the legacy but the practices and the
economic arrangements of the past still pertain – including what one of the
writers refer to as “apartheid constructed geographies.”</span></div>

THIIS was significant in its ability to so subtly and powerfully pair the ways in which ordinary young lives connect to what is often seen as spectacular and out-of-the-ordinary political outbursts. Through the writing, photography and drawings of young thinkers, THIIS spoke of how love, sex, going to school, trying to find a job, parties and parents relate to the vast political troubles of our world.Thought We Had Something Going is a collection of some of the most poignant posts over the 4 years of THIIS online magazine. As South Africa looks at 21 Years of Democracy through ever more jaded eyes, this book points clearly to how life goes on, broken but beautiful, and that freedom is something to be continuously sought – not born with.We launch the narrative called: THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING GOING or #TWHSG for the book and documentary. The book and documentary will only coming out when people have shown commitment to wanting it. And what’s It? Ownership of our own realties. Well… also when we’ve raised enough money.Now it’s up to you. Do you want to know what YOU have going?Excerpt of Zakes Mda's Preface  - Thought We Had Something Going 


When Thando
Sangqu approached me out of the blue to write this Preface I was reluctant at
first. Many people ask me to write Prefaces for all sorts of things, just as
many others send me their unsolicited manuscripts, expecting me to attend to
them pronto. I have learned to turn down such requests; otherwise I would spend
all my life reading and commenting on other people’s writing instead of
attending to my own work. My first instinct then was to reject Thando’s
request. But when he outlined his purpose and objective, I was impressed by his
initiative and the clarity of his vision.
  This
anthology with contributions from a number of writers, photographers and
artists, he told me, aims to explore how young South Africans confront their
truths and their inner political struggles in quest of relevance. “The book
ultimately looks at how in a society that seeks so much validation in brand and
social affiliation that perhaps young people need to learn to be their own
greatest assets and favourite brand,” he added. “We launch this book in the
21st year of South Africa's democracy as I think it is important that we
finally ask the question: where to from here? We have neglected to confront our
truths and perhaps this book is that turning point for South Africa to wake up
by reading the socio-political musings of young people in the infancy of their
careers who have either just graduated or about to graduate.”
  Who could
say no to such noble objectives? 
They write
facilely about sharing apartments in Clifton, about attending expensive private
high school, and about club-hopping and encounters with bouncers. In the same
breath they decry the combination of money and ego, and the sense of naivety
and entitlement that develops in young people of their social and economic
standing. 
Sometimes a
writer reflects on the meaning of freedom in post-1994 South Africa. It is
telling that these writers talk of a “post ’94 South Africa” rather than
post-apartheid. The legacy of apartheid is still very strong in today’s South
Africa. In some instances it is not just the legacy but the practices and the
economic arrangements of the past still pertain – including what one of the
writers refer to as “apartheid constructed geographies.”
  These
writing will take you on journeys of self-examination, self-criticism and
self-discovery.  You will find in this trove interesting analyses of
racial and sexual relationships, and of deeply embedded attitudes, biases and
prejudices that manifest themselves only when friendships are tested. You will
discover the different ways racism manifest itself among the peers.

Here is a collection of short writing by young people that offers us intimate insight into what being young feels, smells, tastes and looks like in South Africa's cities today. Humorous, pained, strained, witty and awkward, the writers in this collection sneer in the face of hyped up caricatures of apathetic young folk. They write for themselves as well as for those older readers who dare give in to their curiosity. A remarkable collection. -  Prof Pumla Dineo Gqola www.thoughtwehadsomethinggoing.comPress Coverage:
