<p>My name is Feruza Afewerki and I am a photographer and creative director. I was born in Eritrea and moved to London in 1996 with my family when I was 3. My connection to Grenfell is one of deep love and loss.</p>
<p>Amal Ahmedin was my big sister and one of the most vibrant, stylish and loving people I knew growing up. She lived life to the full. Her infectious joy lit up any room and she lived to see those around her thriving and happy. Her door and heart were always open. Throughout her life she learned to speak six languages because she was always making new friends.</p>

<p>5 years ago, my family was blessed with a new addition, her daughter Amaya Tuccu. My niece was a creative spirit and 3 years old when her life was cut short. She lived with her parents on the 19th floor of Grenfell Tower. When they moved into their apartment, they began creating a home of joyful memories and this is where they lost their lives on June 14th 2017.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>About me:</p>
<p>I first documented art as a freelancer for the work of artist friends, using a 35mm camera that I had bought in Japan while serving in the US Air Force during the Korean War. I became very skilled at getting the color accurate in the photographs of paintings (unusually difficult with the technology at that time), and was hired by the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in NYC, to photograph artwork for inclusion in their publications. This work led to a lifetime career of providing documentation for institutions, publishers, collectors and artists. </p>
<p>My work eventually caught the attention of Georgia O’Keeffe who hired me to photograph a large painting located at her home in New Mexico, which she had completed 3 years earlier. She flew me to Ghost Ranch where I photographed the painting Sky Above Clouds IV, 1965 (using large format 8 X 10 cameras), and this photo was used as the cover of the 1970 Whitney Museum O’Keeffe Retrospective exhibition catalogue. That was the beginning of an almost 20 year connection with O’Keeffe as her preferred photographer for her paintings. I documented all of the works for the first book of reproductions of her paintings, in which she wrote the autobiographical text, published by Viking Press in 1976.  My connection with O’Keeffe for a period of almost two decades afforded me a chance to get to know O’Keeffe as a person, close-up, and this has undoubtedly informed both consciously and subconsciously how I photographed her when the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>My portraits of O’Keeffe are in the collections of the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of New Mexico, in Santa Fe, and in many private collections. I hope that whoever sees this book will enjoy looking at the photographs, and that they will expand and deepen their perception of her as a person.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This fundraiser will support the production of a book of portraits taken of Georgia O’Keeffe at age 90 that I made in the summer of 1977 when I was a guest of O’Keeffe at her Abiquiu house photographing paintings she was assembling for an upcoming exhibition. During that period Art News commissioned me to take photographs of O’Keeffe for a birthday edition of the magazine and a small selection of the resulting photos were published in the December, 1977 issue of Art News, including my portrait of O’Keeffe on the cover.</p>
<p>That shoot took place over many days and the photos in this book will contain images that show the iconic O’Keeffe as she is known as a strong, unconventional, and intense person. But more surprising, images in the book also show the usually unseen side of her as a compassionate, humorous and relatable person. The book includes photographs of her homes in Abiquiu and Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, and the desert landscapes and bleached animal bones that were the subject of many of her paintings. It also will include photos of the people with whom she was surrounded daily in her homes, as well as photos of O’Keeffe and Juan Hamilton, 60 years her junior, with whom she developed a close and loving friendship during the latter part of her life.</p>
<p>Most of the 65 photographs in this book have never before been published and they will be reproduced in full color at a size of 9”x12”. Included are introductory commentaries by Cody Hartley, Director of the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum, and Barbara Buhler Lynes, the preeminent O’Keeffe scholar, O’Keeffe biographer and author of the Georgia O’Keeffe Catalogue Raisonne. In addition there will be a short introductory essay by me relating to the photographs.</p>
<p>The University of New Mexico Press has been contracted to publish the book in November 2020. As is customary with non-profits, the expense of publishing a large full color art book most often requires that the author provides part of the initial funding for the book. This Indiegogo site has been set up to raise that initial goal of $20,000.00 for this first printing. Below are the perks for donating at various levels and thank you for considering a donation.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>     Hi my name is Star Foreman, I am an editorial photographer based out of Los Angeles and best known for my work with the LA Weekly. Like most of you I was horrified by the Covid-19 outbreak and scared by the subsequent stay home order. </p>
<p>     When the order first came down, and we found out it would be months (not days or weeks,) I felt it was imperative that somebody get a comprehensive portrait of Los Angeles during this time. As I prepped for the project and started creating images I realized that I needed to expand it to all of Southern California. </p>
<p>     Over the course of 32 shoot days, one day on one day off, I traveled to every single location within Southern CA that I could think of that would be visually affected from a stay home order. From Santa Barbara to San Diego I traveled to beaches, malls, public parks. Really, any area that would usually be filled with people I photographed empty. </p>
<p>     What will stay with me for the rest of my life are two things,</p>
<p>1. The Silence.</p>
<p>We are so used to the background noise of other people. I realized this when you standing in the middle of Hollywood blvd on a weekday afternoon and i was all alone. No cars, no people, nothing.  It affected me in a way that words can not adequately describe. I felt like we had all been cut off from one another and left on our own private islands (Animal Crossing reference not intended.)</p>
<p>2. The Smells.</p>
<p>The world smelled so good. Blooming heather on the bluffs of Malibu, jasmine in Santa Barbara, Pershing Square scrubbed off all the urine- the world without people smells amazing. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Now?</h3>
<p>    At this point you might be thinking, ""Why do I need to contribute to your Indiegogo campaign, the project is over?""</p>
<p>      I wish that were true. in order to complete my project I invested about $2800 in equipment, gas, and other essentials needed to make to project a reality. I estimate to finish the project will be between $2000-$3500 and that doesn't even include my stretch goals. </p>
<p>     I have taken 18,500 images over the past two months and 32 shoot days. Each of those images needs to be color corrected, embedded with metadata that includes the date, time and location of each image. After this they must be outputted onto at least two external hard-drives, and uploaded to a cloud account, for safekeeping. They must then be registered with the copyright office. </p>
<p>     Furthermore</p>
<p>     I plan to build a website (<a href=""http://portraitofapandemic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://portraitofapandemic.com</a>) that will give people the ability to see the entire project . The idea is to have 30-60 separate galleries, with each one having the name of the city and the date it was taken, for me to see and hopefully  in the future remember and teach those who come after us, what it looks like when only the essential and desperate are out and about. </p>
<p>     I believe what I have created is unique and it will hopefully exist long after I have passed into irrelevance. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Final Projects</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>1. A website that will give viewers a window into Southern CA during the historic Stay Home Order. </p>
<p>2. A series of essays, or even quotes, from people in Southern Ca to go with the images. Stories and anecdotes of their experiences during the lockdown. To get these I will need to actively recruit people to write these. I estimate this alone will take me 100 or more hours to accomplish. </p>
<p>Stretch Goals</p>
<p>1. A museum or art exhibition featuring 50-100 of the most affecting images from the series. </p>
<p>2. A coffee table book.</p>
<p>3. A series of actual postcards that people could keep or mail.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>      ""Hey Star, like I love this thing you have made but I am a Ren faire worker who just lost a year's income, I can't really afford to give you money right now.""</p>
<p>     If you love the idea of this project reaching its conclusion, but can't help financially, don't worry. I would love if you would take the time out of your day to tell your more well-heeled friends about this project and encourage them to help if they can. </p>

As I prepped for the project and started creating images I realized that I needed to expand it to all of Southern California. 
     Over the course of 32 shoot days, one day on one day off, I traveled to every single location within Southern CA that I could think of that would be visually affected from a stay home order. From Santa Barbara to San Diego I traveled to beaches, malls, public parks. Really, any area that would usually be filled with people I photographed empty. 
     What will stay with me for the rest of my life are two things,
1. The Silence.
We are so used to the background noise of other people. I realized this when you standing in the middle of Hollywood blvd on a weekday afternoon and i was all alone. No cars, no people, nothing.  It affected me in a way that words can not adequately describe. I felt like we had all been cut off from one another and left on our own private islands (Animal Crossing reference not intended.)
2. The Smells.
The world smelled so good. Blooming heather on the bluffs of Malibu, jasmine in Santa Barbara, Pershing Square scrubbed off all the urine- the world without people smells amazing. 

What Now?
    At this point you might be thinking, ""Why do I need to contribute to your Indiegogo campaign, the project is over?""
      I wish that were true. in order to complete my project I invested about $2800 in equipment, gas, and other essentials needed to make to project a reality. I estimate to finish the project will be between $2000-$3500 and that doesn't even include my stretch goals. 
     I have taken 18,500 images over the past two months and 32 shoot days. Each of those images needs to be color corrected, embedded with metadata that includes the date, time and location of each image. After this they must be outputted onto at least two external hard-drives, and uploaded to a cloud account, for safekeeping. They must then be registered with the copyright office. 
     Furthermore
     I plan to build a website (http://portraitofapandemic.com) that will give people the ability to see the entire project . The idea is to have 30-60 separate galleries, with each one having the name of the city and the date it was taken, for me to see and hopefully  in the future remember and teach those who come after us, what it looks like when only the essential and desperate are out and about. 
     I believe what I have created is unique and it will hopefully exist long after I have passed into irrelevance. 
 

Final Projects
 
1. A website that will give viewers a window into Southern CA during the historic Stay Home Order. 
2. A series of essays, or even quotes, from people in Southern Ca to go with the images. Stories and anecdotes of their experiences during the lockdown. To get these I will need to actively recruit people to write these. I estimate this alone will take me 100 or more hours to accomplish. 
Stretch Goals
1. A museum or art exhibition featuring 50-100 of the most affecting images from the series. 
2. A coffee table book.
3. A series of actual postcards that people could keep or mail.

      ""Hey Star, like I love this thing you have made but I am a Ren faire worker who just lost a year's income, I can't really afford to give you money right now.""
     If you love the idea of this project reaching its conclusion, but can't help financially, don't worry. I would love if you would take the time out of your day to tell your more well-heeled friends about this project and encourage them to help if they can.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Since 2014, I've photographed landscape for<strong> personal project</strong> such as Turkey, Hong Kong, Japan, USA and South Korea.</p>
<p>This project is <strong>sharing</strong> amazing image of mother nature around the world. The reason why I do this project is to <strong>share all of the wondering worlds to many people</strong>.</p>
<p>In this year, I am going to photograph in <strong>Hawaii</strong> from Oct. 1st to Oct. 15th 2017 and someday in Feb 2018. I will be focused on <strong>amazing scenery in Hawaii 2017 through 2018</strong>.</p>
<p>After Hawaii project is done (Middle of March 2018), I will e mail contributors(<strong>above <strong>$</strong>200 perk contributors</strong>) <strong>30</strong> best selected images to pick ONE image for each contributor(more details in Perk). In a few weeks, all contributors send me e mail back to confirm what you like to have. All selected images from Hawaii project will be posted on my studio web site to share many people in the world. (<a href=""http://studioxeno.alltheway.kr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://studioxeno.alltheway.kr</a>) This project is already began, my flight tickets are ready and my passion is fully charged.</p>

<p>As I mention that I am a professional photographer, my photographes are (16""x20"") selling worldwide over $1000 each . In other word, you don't need to worry or doubt about me. All I want is all contributors could enjoy worthy photogrpahs from me.</p>

<p>I wish my first compaign going well and all contributors will be delighted. Therefore, I could do more landscape projects next few years and share the world with many people. Please take the time and share my campaign with friends. Your interest can make a big difference to the success of this project. I hope all landscape images into a series of limited-edition prints for exhibition.</p>

</div></div>","I am Taehyun who is a commercial photographer based in Seoul, South Korea. Mainly shooting cosmetic, Jewerly, fashion items etc...( http://studioxeno.alltheway.kr )  Most of the time I usually spend time with my clients in the studio, but when I have a free time or vacation I am focused on my landscape project.

Since 2014, I've photographed landscape for personal project such as Turkey, Hong Kong, Japan, USA and South Korea.
This project is sharing amazing image of mother nature around the world. The reason why I do this project is to share all of the wondering worlds to many people.
In this year, I am going to photograph in Hawaii from Oct. 1st to Oct. 15th 2017 and someday in Feb 2018. I will be focused on amazing scenery in Hawaii 2017 through 2018.
After Hawaii project is done (Middle of March 2018), I will e mail contributors(above $200 perk contributors) 30 best selected images to pick ONE image for each contributor(more details in Perk). In a few weeks, all contributors send me e mail back to confirm what you like to have. All selected images from Hawaii project will be posted on my studio web site to share many people in the world. (http://studioxeno.alltheway.kr) This project is already began, my flight tickets are ready and my passion is fully charged.

As I mention that I am a professional photographer, my photographes are (16""x20"") selling worldwide over $1000 each . In other word, you don't need to worry or doubt about me. All I want is all contributors could enjoy worthy photogrpahs from me.

I wish my first compaign going well and all contributors will be delighted. Therefore, I could do more landscape projects next few years and share the world with many people. Please take the time and share my campaign with friends. Your interest can make a big difference to the success of this project. I hope all landscape images into a series of limited-edition prints for exhibition.
Sincerely,

Our galaxy is described as a Barred Grand Spiral Galaxy as that is what it looks like from a distance, from inside however, this is not what we see. In the country when looking heavenward on a clear night, at the right time of year, there is a bright mass crossing the sky. This is the centre of the Milky Way.</p><p>I started planning this project six months ago, since then I have created a 10x8 panel mosaic of this region, currently have it hanging up on the wall. My original intention was to create the largest amateur image using a Nikon D810a, but shortly after I decided that if I am going to undertake this project, I should go all in!</p><p>If you would like to have a look at this picture in higher resolution click the link below.

All three are approximately the same size overall but show different regions. I ultimately opted for the 25x10 panel as I felt it gave the best balance.</p><h3>The Past:</h3><p>The current mosaic that I have done was photographed with a 677mm F/5.21 lens and a Nikon D700 (reasonably old now but still does a pretty good job). The Nikon D700 has a full frame sensor (36x24mm) and is considered to be the equivalent to 35mm film in size.</p><p>For the 65 billion pixel photograph, the Nikon D700 is not up to the task. It is a colour camera with an anti-aliasing filter, quite noisy, has very little hydrogen alpha response (the red/magenta nebula)  and requires to be manually operated/controlled.</p><p>As harsh as I am being on what I used to capture the 1 gigapixel mosaic above, I will give it some perspective. The entire picture took 80 minutes, less than an hour and a half. It is an 80 panel mosaic so each panel is a single 60s image taken with what I have described as an older, noisy &amp; not overly sensitive camera.</p><h3><strong>Comparisons &amp; Examples:</strong></h3><p>It would be reasonable to ask the question, ""Why go through all of this extra trouble?"" when the Nikon D700 and current telescope have done quite a good job already. This is best and easiest way to show its importance is with real world examples.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491023714/wowobkurd1zh7ow6j8ax.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>On the left we have an image of the Lagoon nebula which was taken as a part of my 1 gigapixel image of the Milky Way. On the right is a false colour image (same as what Hubble does with images such as the Pillars of Creation) I took with a different camera about 10 months ago. In this comparison we are not as interested in the depth and contrast in the detail, only the star sizes. At this level there isn't a huge perceivable difference but the following two companions show close ups of the same regions, take note of the star size differences.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491023980/rhnwnw7boislz0su0un4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491024014/wuqj4zahmtejhkhoumes.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Earlier on I mentioned that there is an approximate 8x increase in resolution, I hope this helps illustrate my point. This comparison is also to you an idea of the level of detail that is going to be achieved in the final 65 billion pixel image.</p><h3><strong>How Big is Big??</strong></h3><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/iPtiwpDB6Bk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div>The above video shows relative image sizes.

<p>This short video shows a zoom in towards the Lagoon Nebula on a half resolution version of the Milky Way; ~240 million pixels.</p>
</div><h3><strong>The Future:</strong></h3><p>Instead I will be using a monochrome camera that has a pixel density of a 65+mp full frame camera, a step up from the 12mp D700. As this sensor has approx. 1/4 of the area of the D700 it changes from a 25x10 to a 50x20 panel (1000 panels) and will total approx 65 billion pixels as a final image. I have been using a ZWO ASI1600MM-C for a few months but will shortly be transitioning to a QHY163M, same sensor but better architecture. Although the sensor is quite a bit smaller than the D700 it is 5x more sensitive, has a quarter of the read noise (electronic readout noise) and will be able to achieve 8x the resolution.</p><p>To be able to take it deeper and with better colour fidelity, the final image will be captured through 5 filters making it a HaLRGB; a hydrogen emission boosted colour image. To help with this a larger telescope will be used, equivalent to a 600mm F/3 lens. Due to being a larger aperture than my current telescope, it captures approx. 2.3x the amount of light and has a shorter focal length which gives this telescope an overall 3x increase in signal. What this means is that on paper, what my current telescope can capture in six hours the new one will capture in two.</p><p>The last piece in this puzzle is a work station. My laptop (15"" MacBook Pro) has been able to deal with everything I've thrown at it so far but when it comes to processing an image file that will be a fraction shy of 1 terabyte in size, it will struggle; yes the final image will fill a standard 1TB external HD. Depending on the number of layers used in Photoshop for editing, it could push 1.5TB in size. There will also be approx. 8TB of associated files needed to create the final image but they can be spread out over multiple smaller HDs. Dealing with 1000 individual panels is quite easy albeit very time consuming. Combining and editing a thousand 65 MP images requires an extra boost in power.</p><h3><strong>Where to from here:</strong></h3><p>This is a project that I will not be starting until May. The telescope for this project is not likely to arrive until late April, the team in at Officina Stellare tell me that they're just waiting on the installation of the optical components right now (March). By May the panels are suitably high enough above the horizon at a reasonable hour; at the moment I have a window between 3-4:30 am where they are high enough above the horizon and the sun isn't starting to come up.</p><p>As is mentioned above, this is going to be a 1000 panel mosaic but this is just a minimum, it really doesn't have to stop there. The current largest astronomical image is 46 billion pixels and a zoomable version of that can be found below. It not only spans the width of what I have planned (albeit not as high) but all the way to the Eta Carina Nebula near the constellation Crux (Southern Cross).</p><p><a href=""http://gds.astro.rub.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://gds.astro.rub.de</a></p><p>Going further adds a considerable amount of time, not only in capturing the images but in processing and power required to get it finished. Arguably I could do the entire view of the southern hemisphere given years of patience and hard work.</p><h3><strong>The Next Step:</strong></h3><p>The next step is having a successful campaign! The reason this has been set up as a Flexible Funding Campaign is that I plan to complete this irrespective of how this campaign goes. If for whatever reason it isn't fully funded everyone will still get what they have pledged, some may just take a bit longer to fulfil (processing will take considerably longer). It is a project that I do want to complete so I am putting considerable amounts of money in as it is. A successful campaign allows for more to be done faster and at a higher quality. A more than successful campaign potentially allows a much larger image than 65 billion pixels!</p><p>This is where all of you come in, the masses that like the heading ""The Worlds Biggest..."". This is more than just a big picture though, it is a glimpse into our past, our beginnings. Carl Sagan is rebound of saying that we are ""Star Dust"", we are the ash born from the embers of the universes past. </p><p>Whether you simply want a zoomable image of the Milky Way to look over and see what you yourself can discover (find all of the open star clusters that will be in this field) or you want a picture t hang up on your wall because, lets face it, space pictures are awesome; you can be a part of a bigger project, one to create the Worlds Largest Astronomical Image.</p><div> </div><h3><strong>Perks:</strong></h3><p><i><u>Zoomable Image:</u></i> Although a full resolution version of the Worlds Largest Astronomical Image will be put online, it will only be visible to anyone who pledges for this project for a time. This perk will allow all backers not only access to the full image BUT access to it while I am putting it together AND any extended size that this image goes to. It will be made fully public 12-24 months after the project is complete. </p><p><i><u>Assortment of Backgrounds:</u></i> There are a considerable amount of stellar objects and beautiful regions that fall into the field that this project covers. Some of them are clearly visible in the EasyZoom link towards the top of the page, regions such as the Lagoon, Triffid &amp; Catspaw nebulas. Although not in that field, the Eagle Nebula (most notable for the Pillars of Creation) will make an appearance. Backgrounds for phones, laptops and desktops will be made from the various regions covered in this project.</p><p><u><i>Photobook (Digital/Print):</i></u> Much like the background images, a photobook will be designed and created out of the many wonderful regions that have been captured. The book will be 15"" x 11"", printed on high quality 190 GSM paper.</p><p><u><i>Small Framed Print:</i></u> You can get a print that has a maximum dimensions of 12"" x 8"" (the matting and frame increase the size more than this). This means that the current 1 gigapixel image is a 12"" x 6"" print being a 2:1 aspect ratio.</p><p><u><i>Medium Framed Print:</i></u> You can get a print that has a maximum dimensions of 18"" x 12"" (the matting and frame increase the size more than this). The 65 billion pixel mosaic has an aspect ratio of 3.3:1 making it a true panorama and also an 18"" x 5.45"" print (this is just a back of the envelope calculation, accurate dimensions will not be possible until the project is complete).</p><p><u><i>Large Framed Print:</i></u> You can get a print that has a maximum dimensions of 24"" x 16"" (the matting and frame increase the size more than this). Any other region can be chosen to be printed, the best way of doing this will eventually be through the zoomable image where you can screen shot the region you would like.</p></div>","We live in the outer spiral arm of a galaxy known as the Milky Way.

The Nikon D700 has a full frame sensor (36x24mm) and is considered to be the equivalent to 35mm film in size.For the 65 billion pixel photograph, the Nikon D700 is not up to the task. It is a colour camera with an anti-aliasing filter, quite noisy, has very little hydrogen alpha response (the red/magenta nebula)  and requires to be manually operated/controlled.As harsh as I am being on what I used to capture the 1 gigapixel mosaic above, I will give it some perspective. The entire picture took 80 minutes, less than an hour and a half. It is an 80 panel mosaic so each panel is a single 60s image taken with what I have described as an older, noisy & not overly sensitive camera.Comparisons & Examples:It would be reasonable to ask the question, ""Why go through all of this extra trouble?"" when the Nikon D700 and current telescope have done quite a good job already. This is best and easiest way to show its importance is with real world examples.On the left we have an image of the Lagoon nebula which was taken as a part of my 1 gigapixel image of the Milky Way. On the right is a false colour image (same as what Hubble does with images such as the Pillars of Creation) I took with a different camera about 10 months ago. In this comparison we are not as interested in the depth and contrast in the detail, only the star sizes. At this level there isn't a huge perceivable difference but the following two companions show close ups of the same regions, take note of the star size differences.Earlier on I mentioned that there is an approximate 8x increase in resolution, I hope this helps illustrate my point. This comparison is also to you an idea of the level of detail that is going to be achieved in the final 65 billion pixel image.How Big is Big??The above video shows relative image sizes. I starts from a 100 pixel block moving out through the resolution of HD TV, the Nikon D700 and all the way out to the 65 billion pixel mosaic. 

This short video shows a zoom in towards the Lagoon Nebula on a half resolution version of the Milky Way; ~240 million pixels.
The Future:Instead I will be using a monochrome camera that has a pixel density of a 65+mp full frame camera, a step up from the 12mp D700. As this sensor has approx. 1/4 of the area of the D700 it changes from a 25x10 to a 50x20 panel (1000 panels) and will total approx 65 billion pixels as a final image. I have been using a ZWO ASI1600MM-C for a few months but will shortly be transitioning to a QHY163M, same sensor but better architecture. Although the sensor is quite a bit smaller than the D700 it is 5x more sensitive, has a quarter of the read noise (electronic readout noise) and will be able to achieve 8x the resolution.To be able to take it deeper and with better colour fidelity, the final image will be captured through 5 filters making it a HaLRGB; a hydrogen emission boosted colour image. To help with this a larger telescope will be used, equivalent to a 600mm F/3 lens. Due to being a larger aperture than my current telescope, it captures approx. 2.3x the amount of light and has a shorter focal length which gives this telescope an overall 3x increase in signal. What this means is that on paper, what my current telescope can capture in six hours the new one will capture in two.The last piece in this puzzle is a work station. My laptop (15"" MacBook Pro) has been able to deal with everything I've thrown at it so far but when it comes to processing an image file that will be a fraction shy of 1 terabyte in size, it will struggle; yes the final image will fill a standard 1TB external HD. Depending on the number of layers used in Photoshop for editing, it could push 1.5TB in size. There will also be approx. 8TB of associated files needed to create the final image but they can be spread out over multiple smaller HDs. Dealing with 1000 individual panels is quite easy albeit very time consuming. Combining and editing a thousand 65 MP images requires an extra boost in power.Where to from here:This is a project that I will not be starting until May. The telescope for this project is not likely to arrive until late April, the team in at Officina Stellare tell me that they're just waiting on the installation of the optical components right now (March). By May the panels are suitably high enough above the horizon at a reasonable hour; at the moment I have a window between 3-4:30 am where they are high enough above the horizon and the sun isn't starting to come up.As is mentioned above, this is going to be a 1000 panel mosaic but this is just a minimum, it really doesn't have to stop there. The current largest astronomical image is 46 billion pixels and a zoomable version of that can be found below. It not only spans the width of what I have planned (albeit not as high) but all the way to the Eta Carina Nebula near the constellation Crux (Southern Cross).http://gds.astro.rub.deGoing further adds a considerable amount of time, not only in capturing the images but in processing and power required to get it finished. Arguably I could do the entire view of the southern hemisphere given years of patience and hard work.The Next Step:The next step is having a successful campaign! The reason this has been set up as a Flexible Funding Campaign is that I plan to complete this irrespective of how this campaign goes. If for whatever reason it isn't fully funded everyone will still get what they have pledged, some may just take a bit longer to fulfil (processing will take considerably longer). It is a project that I do want to complete so I am putting considerable amounts of money in as it is. A successful campaign allows for more to be done faster and at a higher quality. A more than successful campaign potentially allows a much larger image than 65 billion pixels!This is where all of you come in, the masses that like the heading ""The Worlds Biggest..."". This is more than just a big picture though, it is a glimpse into our past, our beginnings. Carl Sagan is rebound of saying that we are ""Star Dust"", we are the ash born from the embers of the universes past. Whether you simply want a zoomable image of the Milky Way to look over and see what you yourself can discover (find all of the open star clusters that will be in this field) or you want a picture t hang up on your wall because, lets face it, space pictures are awesome; you can be a part of a bigger project, one to create the Worlds Largest Astronomical Image. Perks:Zoomable Image: Although a full resolution version of the Worlds Largest Astronomical Image will be put online, it will only be visible to anyone who pledges for this project for a time. This perk will allow all backers not only access to the full image BUT access to it while I am putting it together AND any extended size that this image goes to. It will be made fully public 12-24 months after the project is complete. Assortment of Backgrounds: There are a considerable amount of stellar objects and beautiful regions that fall into the field that this project covers. Some of them are clearly visible in the EasyZoom link towards the top of the page, regions such as the Lagoon, Triffid & Catspaw nebulas. Although not in that field, the Eagle Nebula (most notable for the Pillars of Creation) will make an appearance. Backgrounds for phones, laptops and desktops will be made from the various regions covered in this project.Photobook (Digital/Print): Much like the background images, a photobook will be designed and created out of the many wonderful regions that have been captured. The book will be 15"" x 11"", printed on high quality 190 GSM paper.Small Framed Print: You can get a print that has a maximum dimensions of 12"" x 8"" (the matting and frame increase the size more than this). This means that the current 1 gigapixel image is a 12"" x 6"" print being a 2:1 aspect ratio.Medium Framed Print: You can get a print that has a maximum dimensions of 18"" x 12"" (the matting and frame increase the size more than this). The 65 billion pixel mosaic has an aspect ratio of 3.3:1 making it a true panorama and also an 18"" x 5.45"" print (this is just a back of the envelope calculation, accurate dimensions will not be possible until the project is complete).Large Framed Print: You can get a print that has a maximum dimensions of 24"" x 16"" (the matting and frame increase the size more than this). Any other region can be chosen to be printed, the best way of doing this will eventually be through the zoomable image where you can screen shot the region you would like.",5.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>La maggior parte dei miei lavori si è sempre svolto in digitale, ma riprendere in mano la fotografia a pellicola è stata una svolta per la mia fotografia.</p>
<p>C'è qualcosa di magico nell'attesa dei tuoi scatti, nei toni, nell'esperienza che la fotografia a pellicola può restituirti. L'attesa del risultato e l'incertezza son quegli elementi che fanno accrescere esponenzialmente il valore dei tuoi scatti.</p>

<p>La guida definitiva alla fotografia a pellicola è una guida sia per beginners, che per avanzati che vogliono approfondire certi aspetti di questo mondo, in cui vi spiego tutto dalle basi, allo scatto, allo sviluppo fino al prodotto finale.</p>
<p>Non essendo il maggiore esperto di fotografia a pellicola di questo mondo, nel video avrò anche ospiti speciali e diverse sorprese che vedrete in futuro.</p>
<p>La guida verrà realizzata in qualsiasi caso, ma volendo fare un prodotto di qualità molto elevata mi piacerebbe poter avere un budget più consistente da poter investire in risorse, eventuali premi per un giveaway a sfondo pellicola, animazioni più complesse e molto altro ancora.</p>

<p>The photos taken for this book will contribute to a greater research question centered on public responses to being photographed and willingness to engage with strangers. As a street photographer, I have been met with both complete open willingness to engage with me when I strike up a conversation with a camera in hand and total apprehension or aggression. I am interested in researching how this same act is greeted in a country like Malta. The project is titled skuzi because it is the Maltese word for ‘excuse me.’ A phrase that I will consistently use to begin my interactions with people in the community.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What You Get &amp; My Experience</h2>
<p>Your trust. Having a new favorite coffee table book, framed photo, or high-five is a big deal these days. The photos I will be taking and the subsequent project I will be producing requires your trust to make them engaging, intimate, and interesting. How do you know that will happen?</p>
<p>You can know this by looking through my past work on my website (<a href=""https://www.danlampmann.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.danlampmann.com</a>) and on my Instagram (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/danlampmann/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/danlampmann/</a>). The focus of my photography is and has always been to capture true moments and tell real stories. Whether it be sitting with folks experiencing homelessness in Pittsburgh to speaking with a foreman at a construction site in Philadelphia to sitting down with world-renowned sculptor Thaddeus Mosley, I focus on people, their stories, and the incredible lives of the strangers that we pass each day.</p>
<p>I don't misrepresent, I contextualize and share the stories I'm told. That is what you will get when you support this project with a financial donation. That is what I promise.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why Malta?</h2>
<p>Malta is an incredible country with a complicated and constantly developing culture because of the relationship between traditional values and Western influences. It's a densely populated island that is not Italian, nor English, but distinctly Maltese.</p>
<p>The island sits in the Mediterranean Sea, just South of Italy and Sicily, Northeast of Tunisia, and directly North of Libya. </p>
<p>Malta's location and history have granted it a unique religious and cultural heritage. It only recently achieved independence in 1964 and joined the European Union in 2004. </p>
<p>This is a culture I believe should be more widely known about and I hope that through my work, I will be able to share its culture with more people.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>This is my first photography book, and it's in another country and I'm asking for a lot of support. It's a risky move. But here's the thing, with risk comes opportunity. A fellow photographer and cultural anthropologist, Joshua Cogan recently told me this: ""you can either hang out here and wait for someone to discover you or you can go do something."" So, I decided to go do something.</p> <h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>If you are unable to donate, there are other ways to support! You can:</p>

<li>Share this link on social media with a personal endorsement. Your support means the world.</li>
<li>Send me any links or ideas for grants and scholarships you know of that you feel this project is perfect for.</li>

</div></div>","About the Project
Skuzi - a Photo Essay of Maltese Life will celebrate Maltese culture and daily life. 
This project will capture moments that reflect the island country’s beauty by sharing the lives of the fishermen, shopkeepers, religious leaders, and others that give the Mediterranean archipelago its character.
This project will be conducted with the guidance and support of Expeditions, Research in Applied Anthropology, and the Off the Beaten Track Field School (https://www.xpeditions.be). This is the longest standing cultural anthropology field school in the world.

</div><p></p><h3>The Project:</h3><p>There is a place where the distinction between waking life and dreaming life is blurred. A place where people gather to create a model of a new world, a world they only dream about. In this new world, creativity is limitless and there is absolute freedom of expression. People are unafraid to connect with one another. Upon meeting there is immediate affection, there is eye contact. People experience each other's energy and recognize each other's spirits. They encourage one another toward personal growth in mind, body, and spirit. Societal boundaries are broken. In this place the sacred is respected and celebrated. </p><p>In May of 2014, I experienced my first Transformational Festival, Lightning In A Bottle. Some friends of mine had an installation at this festival, and they brought me on the team to photograph their project. Initially, I thought this was going to be like any other music festival I had attended in the past. Except, it featured electronic music. What I found, instead, was a safe and creative environment for an emerging culture to thrive; a culture dedicated to expanding human awareness by cultivating love in our relationships with each other, ourselves, and our environment. People of this culture see each other as mirror reflections of themselves. Transformational Festivals are immersive, participatory realities that inspire positive change within the participants. </p><p><i>Creating A Dream</i> is my effort to document a new culture that illuminates hope, creativity, joy, and love. Through still photographs and short films, I invite the viewer to experience these festivals and people the way I experience them. </p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1240637/files/20150222141049-tumblr_n7xx4w11SJ1srczloo1_r1_1280.jpg?1424643049"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>I am requesting $10,000 in order to finish shooting <i>Creating A Dream</i>. The money goes directly toward travel, equipment, admission to the festivals (if I cannot retrieve a media pass), printing supplies, promotional materials to send to publishers, food, and camping gear. The vision is to publish <i>Creating A Dream</i> as a book. The book will include 20-40 photographs along with writings, such as quotes from festival participants and my own thoughts and experiences. The book release will be an interactive experience. The prints will be on display amongst music, dancers, performers, healers, and more... I want to bring the transformational festival experience to the event! </p>
<p>To do all of this, I need your help. I do not currently bring in enough income to fund this project alone. So here I am, asking for help to make <i>Creating A Dream</i> a reality. I need this money in order to finish shooting the project, and to shop it out to book publishers!</p>
<p>In exchange for your donations, there will be perks! Such perks include limited edition prints, an inside look into the project, signed copies of the book, hand-picked treasures from my travels, and much more! I would LOVE for you to join me in this journey.</p>

<br/><h3>How I Feel About Photography:</h3>
<p>I started taking photographs when I was ten years old. From that moment on it has always felt right to be looking at my world through a lens, because that is how I see things: cinematically. In the beginning of my relationship with photography, I felt that I was trying so hard to take “good photos” using the tools I had learned in school to properly compose/expose the image. Then I fell in love with the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson, and suddenly learned that there is no secret to taking good photos. You simply have to look. That is when I took all the “rules” I had been taught and threw them out the window, letting my eyes guide me towards beauty.</p>
<p>To look at my photographs is to look at my Self. To feel my energy, see the magic that I see in life, get inside my mind, eyes, and heart. Taking photographs is meditative. I must be completely present, focusing all energy and love in to the moment, so when I click that shutter I have captured a moment in time that has feeling. Richard Avedon once said that “a photograph is the death of a moment.” When you look at a photograph you are literally looking at the death of that moment. It was there, for that fraction of a second... and will never be again. But here is the proof that moment existed, and here is how I experienced that moment. The magic of photography continues to amaze me every time I see a beautiful image. When you look at my photograph, the light that shines in me radiates to you. It is this way with all forms of art, which is why art is so important. Life is about connecting with everyone and everything, and art is a link. </p>
<p>See through my eyes and feel my spirit.</p>

</div></div>","SUPPOSE THAT ONE DAY YOU WANTED TO TALK WITH SOMEONE WHO IS IMPORTANT TO YOU WHO PASSED AWAYDAY OF THE DEAD - A human celebration of life - is a contemporary artistic
experience which will allow you to go deep inside of a
never told story about this annual ritual subscribed in 2008 to the UNESCO
intangible cultural heritage list. This simple question may be the main idea to peer inside one of the most
world´s widely known cultural celebrations.  I find that most of the time,
people only can see the surface of this amazing event. During the last
6 months I have been working to produce a contemporary
photographic artwork to let the world know why this Mexican celebration is an
important human cultural heritage.CELEBRATING LIFE
TROUGH ART
A very pure and
clear message for those who have lost a friend, brother, sister, child, or
parent to understand the deep vision about a celebration of life and honor to dead ones.
I will be using different
artistic techniques such as: Art Installation, body paint, motion photography, light painting and
the traditional materials used in this ritual to compose and capture a very
unique and contemporary photographic collection, sharing it trough a large
scale outdoor fine art exhibition in San Miguel de Allende in November 2015. 

FEAR, LOVE, SADNESS, JOY, ANGER, PEACE
I believe that life is something awesome, but
sometimes it's hard to face our own path in life.
The Day of The Dead celebration offers something really important for every
human’s life and I want to help to understand and share it in several ways of
art. We are working to make this happen in four
artistic expressions, created with the support of a great team of people
conformed by Mexican and international artists, professional consulters,
designers, activist and networkers.

My name is Denise but many know me as Rain.  I've been an aspiring plus-size model for a while but I've never had the confidence to do anything real until I started on social media about a year ago. <br/><br/>My followers and fans have given me such a confidence boost and in turn I've also received several messages from woman I've helped inspire through my amateur modelling and body acceptance. I want to make a calendar for my fans, for body positivity and to also help establish me as a (semi) real model.

My name is Denise but many know me as Rain.  I've been an aspiring plus-size model for a while but I've never had the confidence to do anything real until I started on social media about a year ago. My followers and fans have given me such a confidence boost and in turn I've also received several messages from woman I've helped inspire through my amateur modelling and body acceptance. I want to make a calendar for my fans, for body positivity and to also help establish me as a (semi) real model. I've always liked showing off my ""assets"" but I feel you can be sexual and tasteful. Your support is greatly appreciated. 
  What We Need & What You Get
 I'm looking to raise $1000 to print and ship 50 calendars, I'd love to be able to do more though. 
 Perks available include signed prints from me, drawings by me, digital picture sets, bras/underwear, skype dates, and of course - the calendar itself, once completed. 
 All funds gathered will go towards production and photographer costs. 
All digital perks will be sent out within a week of your contribution
All perks to be shipped (not including calendars) will be sent out in March 

All perks with calendars will be sent out in May after they are produced.
    The Impact  This project is important to me in establishing an idea of if I could possibly be successful in the field of modelling at all. 

I also love to inspire other plus size women who might feel they're not sexy or beautiful because of their curves, I want to show that big women can feel sexy. 




    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Please share this campaign, get the word out to other body positive people or fans of plus size girls. :)

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to get 20 of my photos printed in sizes ranging from 11 x 14 to 16 x 20. I also need to frame each of these pictures.</p>
<p>Once I have gotten the pictures printed and framed, I will be able to put them up for sale in the business where they will stay for 1-2 months or until sold. If enough money is raised I will also be able to make some smaller prints (that will be without frames) to sell at this business or other locations.   <br/>After I have made some sales, I will be able to thank all of my donors with a print of their very own! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Two years ago when I decided that I wanted to become a professional photographer, I began honing in on my skills. Now that I feel prepared to really start in the professional world, I need to get my foot in the door. Unfortunately, my circumstances have not allowed me to set aside money for hard copies of my photographs. With this first chance to have my photography displayed, I hope to really jump into my career as a photographer. I have already done the album artwork for a local band, but hard copies of my photography is a must at this next starting point in my career. </p>

I have also spoken with a number of local DJ's about spinning at the opening, and am confident I will be able to find the right person. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">To keep costs low, </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I will also be hanging the work unframed. </span></p>

Hello, hello! I'm Johnny, Johnny Tang! I'm an emerging photographer based in Brooklyn, NY. I got into photography because I'm not very good at much else, but I'm pretty good at photography! I'm looking raise funds for a solo exhibition at a Hiphop lifestyle store called Reed Space, in New York's Lower East Side neighborhood.
My work so far has been exhibited in numerous cities domestically and abroad including: Boston, Miami, Atlanta, and Hong Kong. Recent exhibitions include: World of One at Emmanuelle College in Boston, and the 2015 MassArt Auction. This will be my first solo show in New York.


The Project
Since 2011 I have collaborated with some of the country's best street dancers (mostly BBoys and Poppers) on a series of portraits I call ""BBoy Monsters"".  By taking a base move or stance and combining it with multiple variations, we build an image that further exaggerates each dancer’s signature moves, poses, and/or characteristics. 
These portraits celebrate the creative achievements of these dancers (and the culture of Hiphop as a whole), while also making it more accessible for outsiders to appreciate. Your contributions will help me bring this work to a wider audience, and help spread the positive influence of hiphop.   
What I Need Most of the work for the exhibition is already finished. That is to say I have images to show, but I need funds to get them printed, make promotional materials, and hire a DJ to play the proper music for the dancers at my opening reception. 
The majority of the funding will go towards printing the work, and also to ensure donors will receive their perks. 
Here's how the costs break down:

Printing 36.8%

Perk Production + Shipping 25.3%
DJ - 14.75%
Incidentals - 13.33%
Indiegogo + Processing fees - 8.26%
Promotional Materials - 1.49%


If the entire goal is not reached, I will use what funds are available to fulfill perks for what pledges are made, using what is leftover to help relieve the cost of printing for the show. 
If we surpass the goal, the extra funds will go towards offering more perks and promotional materials for the show.

The Impact
If successful, we will be able to introduce the BBoy subculture to a new audience of art and photography lovers, and maybe even get some Hiphop enthusiasts interested in some art as well. The majority of the work is already done, I just need a little bit of help for the final push.


Risks & Challenges Raising the money to print this work, actually is the biggest challenge at this stage of the project. I have already picked out a professional printer to make the prints, with whom I have worked with exclusively for the past 3 years. The showcards, postcards, and posters are 90% finished and almost ready for production. I have also spoken with a number of local DJ's about spinning at the opening, and am confident I will be able to find the right person. To keep costs low, I will also be hanging the work unframed. 
All that's left is to place the orders and put the work into production.

It is a spiritual trek that begins at your doorstep, winds through several trails in France, Spain, and Portugal, ultimately ending in the City of Santiago de Compostela. Legend has it that the bones of St. James the Martyr were spirited away from Jerusalem after his beheading and brought to Finis Terre, in Roman Spain  and eventually buried in the Basilica of Santiago de Compostela. These remains are what have drawn millions of people from all over the world to seek religious and spiritual enlightenment through prayer and hardship.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520278780/shuxm4tfuukdgwykocax.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A Little Bit About Me</h3><p>I originally titled my book, “<i>An Old Fat Man on the Camino…</i>” because that is how I see myself. These are not self-deprecating thoughts they are just who I am. I am 57 years old, 5’10” tall, and weigh 245 lbs. (178cm and 110 kilos). I have had 7 knee surgeries, one joint replacement, inner ear surgery, and surgery on one elbow. I also suffer from chronic bronchitis, which sucks because I have never smoked. Why am I telling you this? Because, despite all of my physical problems, I have still been able to hike the entire length of the Camino Frances 500 miles (800km) across Northern Spain.</p><p>My book is an invitation for every person that dreams of walking the Camino de Santiago but are afraid that they do not have the physical abilities to complete such a task -- to get off their backsides and just go. Trust me, even if you are not able to finish, even if you can only walk a few days or weeks, you will neither regret nor forget the Camino. I have since changed the title of the book to <i>“Stories of A Wayward Pilgrim….”</i> Because, well, it sounds less self-deprecating, but it is just another way that I see myself. I have always been a “wayward” soul, never lost but just kind of moving in my own direction at my own pace.</p><p><i>“Stories of A Wayward Pilgrim, St Jean Pied de Port to Santiago Compostela”</i> is not a guidebook. It has no great spiritual insights. It is the daily stories of one man’s simple, and quite ordinary, adventures of an extraordinary journey on the Camino de Santiago. These stories are accompanied by 200 photographs of the people I met, the places I visited, and the things I saw. Maybe we can call it a photo-journal. Regardless, I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I have enjoyed producing it.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520278944/uo7hina6lpiw7vdbzs6k.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Short Summary of Funding</h3><p>I have a two-prong plan for <i>“The Stories of a Wayward Pilgrim….”</i>: First is to gather funds for a high-quality and affordable printing of the book. Your pre-orders will make this possible. I have put in over two years of my life into the production of this book. Forty days and 500 miles of hiking and taking photographs of the Camino de Santiago, in Spain. Two separate trips, one in the spring and another in the fall to gather all of my photographs and stories. I spent countless weeks writing my stories and editing my photographs. Then, I took on the daunting task of learning how to design a book and the programs that would allow this design. ‘If there was a mistake, I made it’, is not an understatement. I designed the book three times, once as an eBook and twice as printed books. Countless edits in all the process ensued. But, now it is complete, and I think this project deserves a high-quality printing.</p><p>My second part of the plan is a sequel, or maybe a prequel, to the first book. My second journey will be the 500 miles of trails that proceed the Camino de Santiago. The Via Podiensis, in France, is one of a number of routes that the French would take to get to Spain and on to Santiago de Compostela. The primary difference of the hike, other than the country, is that I will be better prepared to both photograph and write this book. <i>“Stories of A Wayward Pilgrim, France, Le Puy-en-Valez to St Jean Pied de Port”.</i></p><p>Your pre-orders will guarantee you copies of the books and the included portfolio images. The remaining funds will allow me to start the prequel.

It is a spiritual trek that begins at your doorstep, winds through several trails in France, Spain, and Portugal, ultimately ending in the City of Santiago de Compostela. Legend has it that the bones of St. James the Martyr were spirited away from Jerusalem after his beheading and brought to Finis Terre, in Roman Spain  and eventually buried in the Basilica of Santiago de Compostela. These remains are what have drawn millions of people from all over the world to seek religious and spiritual enlightenment through prayer and hardship.A Little Bit About MeI originally titled my book, “An Old Fat Man on the Camino…” because that is how I see myself. These are not self-deprecating thoughts they are just who I am. I am 57 years old, 5’10” tall, and weigh 245 lbs. (178cm and 110 kilos). I have had 7 knee surgeries, one joint replacement, inner ear surgery, and surgery on one elbow. I also suffer from chronic bronchitis, which sucks because I have never smoked. Why am I telling you this? Because, despite all of my physical problems, I have still been able to hike the entire length of the Camino Frances 500 miles (800km) across Northern Spain.My book is an invitation for every person that dreams of walking the Camino de Santiago but are afraid that they do not have the physical abilities to complete such a task -- to get off their backsides and just go. Trust me, even if you are not able to finish, even if you can only walk a few days or weeks, you will neither regret nor forget the Camino. I have since changed the title of the book to “Stories of A Wayward Pilgrim….” Because, well, it sounds less self-deprecating, but it is just another way that I see myself. I have always been a “wayward” soul, never lost but just kind of moving in my own direction at my own pace.“Stories of A Wayward Pilgrim, St Jean Pied de Port to Santiago Compostela” is not a guidebook. It has no great spiritual insights. It is the daily stories of one man’s simple, and quite ordinary, adventures of an extraordinary journey on the Camino de Santiago. These stories are accompanied by 200 photographs of the people I met, the places I visited, and the things I saw. Maybe we can call it a photo-journal. Regardless, I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I have enjoyed producing it.Short Summary of FundingI have a two-prong plan for “The Stories of a Wayward Pilgrim….”: First is to gather funds for a high-quality and affordable printing of the book. Your pre-orders will make this possible. I have put in over two years of my life into the production of this book. Forty days and 500 miles of hiking and taking photographs of the Camino de Santiago, in Spain. Two separate trips, one in the spring and another in the fall to gather all of my photographs and stories. I spent countless weeks writing my stories and editing my photographs. Then, I took on the daunting task of learning how to design a book and the programs that would allow this design. ‘If there was a mistake, I made it’, is not an understatement. I designed the book three times, once as an eBook and twice as printed books. Countless edits in all the process ensued. But, now it is complete, and I think this project deserves a high-quality printing.My second part of the plan is a sequel, or maybe a prequel, to the first book. My second journey will be the 500 miles of trails that proceed the Camino de Santiago. The Via Podiensis, in France, is one of a number of routes that the French would take to get to Spain and on to Santiago de Compostela. The primary difference of the hike, other than the country, is that I will be better prepared to both photograph and write this book. “Stories of A Wayward Pilgrim, France, Le Puy-en-Valez to St Jean Pied de Port”.Your pre-orders will guarantee you copies of the books and the included portfolio images. The remaining funds will allow me to start the prequel. Your pre-orders for “St Jean…to …Santiago”, will be delivered in 4 to 6 weeks after the conclusion of the initial campaign and on a regular basis thereafter. I am projecting that “Le Puy-en-Valez” will be ready for print by the spring/summer of 2019.My future plans involve other roads and other books, but let’s just focus on these two for now.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I am Luka Mjeda, a photographer from Zagreb, Croatia and I developed a strong interest in photography after working with American photographers Mary Ellen Mark, Michael O´Neil and Jerry Uelsmann at a workshop in Zagreb. My first years in photography were earmarked by the collaboration with Jozo Ćetković, a Croatian Master of Photography and after that, it was a wonderful journey of learning and practicing photography while working with a string of great designers, photographers, writers and artists. A decade ago I published a book with 80 portraits of Croatian artists and it came natural to me to publish this book about the photographers and photography scene in Croatia from the 1980´s up to now.</p>

This book has taken me nearly 9 years to complete and  will be my most important accomplishment, I am an artist and a photographer and have had a successful portrait business in Laguna Beach for nearly 19 years. But now, at 76, I'm retired and loving my life in Northern California.<br/></p>
<p>This book represents the culmination of my soul's purpose which is to help raise self awareness for women in mid life who need a fresh new empowering perception of themselves. I'm  passionate about women finding their authentic, natural beauty without spending tons of money to reconstruct their face and bodies into younger versions of themselves. This is a social disease I am determined to do my part in healing.</p><p></p><p>I'm thrilled to report that many of the women featured in the book who were single  moms or just single at the time, are 
now happily married or in long term relationships, finding true love from ages 45 to 60<b>. There's Talia who struggled for years
 to find work and to attract a full time daddy for her beautiful 
daughter, finally found her soulmate in Germany along with a thriving 
career in bodywork. And Rajyo, disfigured with a mastectomy at the age of 50 is now joyously united with her handsome and loving soulmate husband....and the list goes on. Every union (8 that I know of)  occurred sometime after their photoshoots. I like to think their experience as a daylong Natural Goddess had a little something to do with it.</b></p><b>
</b>
<p>This soft covered 8-1/2""x 11"" book will be 120 pages long, half of which are color photographs and the other half personal transformational stories and quotes, poems and writings by well known authors. I would like to purchase the <b>Reveal Package from Balboa Press which costs $2799</b>. Here is some of what I'll get with the Reveal Package:</p>

We need to recognize and honor them as role models who can bring feminine wisdom into our political and social discussions and to set a new standard of beauty. We've been slaves to the media and its distorted perception of beauty for too long. I'm hoping this book will serve as an inspiration to reconnect with our natural beauty and power as women. <b>Marianne Williamson</b> gave this book a wonderful endorsement.

<ul></ul>
</div></div>","Hi My name is Yamini and I'm raising money to  self publish  my book ""The Natural Goddess - Portraits of True Beauty in Women Over 40"". This book has taken me nearly 9 years to complete and  will be my most important accomplishment, I am an artist and a photographer and have had a successful portrait business in Laguna Beach for nearly 19 years. But now, at 76, I'm retired and loving my life in Northern California.
This book represents the culmination of my soul's purpose which is to help raise self awareness for women in mid life who need a fresh new empowering perception of themselves. I'm  passionate about women finding their authentic, natural beauty without spending tons of money to reconstruct their face and bodies into younger versions of themselves. This is a social disease I am determined to do my part in healing.I'm thrilled to report that many of the women featured in the book who were single  moms or just single at the time, are 
now happily married or in long term relationships, finding true love from ages 45 to 60. There's Talia who struggled for years
 to find work and to attract a full time daddy for her beautiful 
daughter, finally found her soulmate in Germany along with a thriving 
career in bodywork. And Rajyo, disfigured with a mastectomy at the age of 50 is now joyously united with her handsome and loving soulmate husband....and the list goes on. Every union (8 that I know of)  occurred sometime after their photoshoots. I like to think their experience as a daylong Natural Goddess had a little something to do with it.

This soft covered 8-1/2""x 11"" book will be 120 pages long, half of which are color photographs and the other half personal transformational stories and quotes, poems and writings by well known authors. I would like to purchase the Reveal Package from Balboa Press which costs $2799. Here is some of what I'll get with the Reveal Package:

Author Volume Discounts,· 
ISBN Assignment,· 
Color Cover Design,· 
Personalized Back Cover,·

E-book Formatting and Distribution, 
Sold on Amazon.com, Barnes&Noble.com.,· 
Included in Balboa Press Catalog,· 
U.S. Copyright Registration,· 
Press Release · Promotional Materials - 100,· 
Booksellers Return Program and much more. I would also like to add 60 extra books for $1546 (40% author discount) along with the book signing kit for $350. I will need another $90 to pay for my 18 extra color pages over the 50 allowed @ $5/ea. and my video for Indiegogo cost me $800 which all comes to $5,495 or $5,500 rounded out.I feel the time has come to shine a light on the Goddess in all aging women. We need to recognize and honor them as role models who can bring feminine wisdom into our political and social discussions and to set a new standard of beauty. We've been slaves to the media and its distorted perception of beauty for too long. I'm hoping this book will serve as an inspiration to reconnect with our natural beauty and power as women. Marianne Williamson gave this book a wonderful endorsement. She said:""This book is a lovely exaltation of feminine beauty and power."" A little about me: I've been an artist all my life, from singing and acting on stage, to drawing and painting portraits, to being a uniform designer and then  costume designer for TV and movies and head of wardrobe for CBS , to being a family portrait photographer and goddess photographer to creating 3 Festival of Goddesses in Laguna Beach  to finally, producing this book.
I'm hoping to create the means to publish my book and get it out to those who might be greatly impacted by it. You could play an important role in that, either with a donation or with getting the word out to your friends.THANK YOU GIFTS FOR YOUR SUPPORT:""I am a Natural Goddess"" T-Shirts in black, grey, white, red, blue or pink and in all sizes.

Campaign Fundraiser Summary

Campaign Founder: Hi, My Name is Aaron Tui. I am currently a student at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa seeking a Bachelor degree in Tropical Plants and Soil Sciences. Although, agriculture and the protection of our natural environment is my field of study, The hobbies throughout my life and my passion has always been in photography and videography, whether it be for business or for fun.



 Recently, I founded Blue Wing Ki'i, a start up photography and videography business, to help capture the beauty of Hawai'i and it's inhabitants.  I wanted to shift  my focus to an area of need here in the islands.  That need is to professionally provide photography and videography to young up and coming athletes who deserve media coverage for recruitment purposes to collegiate and professional sports organizations.    



Why Sports Coverage? The collegiate and pro level opportunities in Hawai'i are scarce compared to the Lower 48 or other places in the world. Hawai'i possesses the most dedicated and talented young up and coming athletes in the world, however most don't get a chance to continue their passion on a higher level. There is not much for these deserving athletes here in Hawai'i when it comes to the next level and it's too far and expensive to travel out of state to look for opportunities. The same can be said for sport recruiters who typically skip Hawai'i, because it is too expensive, too far, and too time consuming to scout in Hawai'i.  

As you might of heard, the winner of this years Heisman Award, the most prestigious award in all of college football, was claimed by Hawaii Born Marcus Mariota. However, while making it to the top on his own Marcus was one of the lucky ones to barely be recruited by a state side College. According to a Wall Street Journalist Ben Cohen, Marcus was not looked at by any college in the states due to the main facts of distance, it being expensive  and too time consuming to travel to Hawai'i for any sport recruiter (http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-no-one-wanted-marcus-mariota-1418327384).








With your contribution, we will be able to provide that needed coverage of Hawai'i's deserving star athletes for the purposes of pro exposure for higher sport level recruitment and sport profile building. There are tons of top athletes like Marcus here in Hawai'i that get overlooked, solely because recruiters don't come out to Hawai'i. If I can bring Hawai'i to the recruiters by way of fair media exposure the deserving athletes here would have a greater chance in achieving their dreams as collegiate and professional level athletes. 


            

   What We Need The Break Down:   In order to get close to where we need to be to fullfill our goal, we need to raise at the very least $20,000 USD. After Credit Service processing fees, indiegogo.com's Fundraiser fees and our own product costs to fullfill award perks to contributors, we will end up with approximately half of our $20,000 goal at $10,533 in which the funds will be used to upgrade our photography and filming equipment.




The Ultimate Goal: Acquire a new Sports Camera System! 


Sport Camera body: D4S - $5,999.95. 
Sport Telephoto Lens: AF-S Nikkor 400mm f/2.8E FL ED VR - $11,999.95. 
Pro Carbon Fiber Monopod and Pro Memory Card - $530.00. 
         *Altogether: $18,529.90 USD


The Minimum Raised Goal: Acquire older model and Less effective Sport Camera System :-(  

Camera Body: Nikon D750 - $1,999.95. 
Telephoto Lens: AF-S Nikkor 400mm f2.8G ED VR - $9,549.95.

Risks & Challenges
Most images to be used to full fill contributor awards or perks have been captured and processed. The challenge lies in capturing a few more high quality images that are totally dependent on the time of day and the weather conditions, which will be completed before the end of the campaign.
The Manufacture of the metal prints in our contributor perk levels will be done by a high quality professional print lab.  Depending on the amount of contributions with the metal print perk, delivery could experience delay. However, perks will be fulfilled as soon as funds are received, so you can receive your award earlier than the expected delivery date in July.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Documenting the work of architect Joseph K. English is about recognizing a prolific, though relatively unknown practitioner who designed numerous modern buildings in Canada during the mid-century era.  It is also about capturing a small part of architectural history before it is too late.</p>
<p>After serving as a Lancaster bomber pilot during the Second World War, English attended the University of Manitoba's School of Architecture and went on to establish his architectural practice in the province of Alberta in the mid-1950s.  With a distinct modernist sensibility, he designed elementary schools, churches, community centres, civic buildings and residences that appear across the urban landscapes of Edmonton and Calgary, as well as many rural towns in western Canada.</p>
<p>The idea for the J.K. English Architecture Project was sparked in the summer of 2009 when I invited my ""Grandpa Joe"" to revisit some of the buildings he had designed and to reminisce about his 25-year career as an architect. Besides learning more about my grandfather’s architectural practice directly from the source, I was able to travel with him to see a number of his buildings and photograph them before he passed away in January 2010.</p>
<p>Although a few of English’s buildings have been listed as historic resources for preservation in the cities of Edmonton and Calgary, others have long since been torn down. Two more have been demolished since the start of this project and there are certainly others that have yet to be identified.</p>
<p>In the past seven years I have been able to photograph more than 30 buildings and track down many archival photos and original blueprints in museums and provincial archives, but there are still many more to be researched and documented and time is running out.  With the success of this campaign, I will be able to finish documenting his remaining buildings before any more disappear.</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473541358/IMG_4750_fog9og.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>

<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>My hope is that the resulting research and documentation from this project will contribute to the records and archives of modern architecture in Canada and be available to historians, archivists, curators, students and anyone interested in Canadian architectural history.  Ideally, it will also increase awareness in the wider community about the history of modern architecture in Western Canada and bring about a greater understanding of the importance of preserving architecture of this era.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the research and documentation will be completed within the next year and the photographs and archival materials will be presented as a website.</p>

We are a small Prague-based group of visual artists and photographers formed around the simple ambition. To capture vanishing relics of mankind history. Our first quest leads to amazing Balkan post-WWII monuments known as ""spomeniks""

Didn't heard about the Balkan ""spomeniks"" yet? Then check them out on Pinterest or on our Facebook Page. Sure, you'll love them. We are going to shoot these amazing monuments, but also process information on the construction of these sculptures, to look for the stories of their creators, to do interviews with witnesses and their family members. And we - our group and you, the supporters on Indiegogo, will self-publish the beautiful book.
Petrova Gora concept by Vojin Bakić (1974, completed 1981)
30 days, 21 monuments, 3 photographers

During our 30 days Balkan trip, we will visit 21 monuments in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia. 
The monuments we will visit in alphabetical order: Čačak, Grmeč, Ilirska Bistrica, Jasenovac, Kadinjača, Kolašin, Kosmaj, Kozara, Kragujevac, Makljen, Nikšić, Ostra, Petrova Gora, Podgarić, Sanski Most, Sisak, Slabinja, Slobodiště, Tjentište, Vukovar and Zenica.



Kosmaj monument

With the generous support by you, the supporters on Indiegogo, we can self-publish the book full of photographs taken during our Balkan trip, accompanied by information about the monuments and their creators. 

Analog style

Our aim is to achieve a technically and aesthetically perfect photographs that can serve as a record of current state of the monuments (some of them were abandoned and more or less devastated).  We will shoot the monuments on medium format film on Sinar camera, which brings indisputable advantages for architectural photography. 
Just for you
We will also create a smaller batch of collector's prints, enlargements and posters shot on black and white negatives, exclusively for you, the supporters on Indiegogo (see featured perks bellow). Also, as a backer you will receive a PDF version of the book, regardless the chosen perk. Every backer will get PDF version of the book.

My Background</strong> <p>
</p>
<p>I am one of the half a million Britons living under the
threat of eviction. </p>
<p>I am a survivor of sustained and severe domestic control,
abuse, rape and oppression<span>  </span></p>
<p>We still bear the scars emotionally and mine physically.</p>
<p>We came back to where they were raised but we are in the
middle of a crisis.</p>
<p>Every homeless person is a tragedy and every eviction a
failure.</p>
<p>We need to stop this.<span> 
Now.</span></p>
<p>Right now I am not interested in electric cars, pollution
or banning vehicles from London.<span>  I
actually think the collapse of the black cab industry would be devastating for
our capital. We need to prioritise housing first and foremost.</span></p>
<p>Old Etonions, Corbyn puppets and career politicians are
not what is needed to end this cycle.</p>
<p>Put a single mother in the ring whose back is against the
wall with her children and watch her fight for equality. This is about making
sure tenants have rights and the government does more for people who are in
danger of losing their homes: now.</p>
<p>In January 2014 I was thrust into the political ring when
I received a section 21 letter.</p>
<p>Having never been a second late with my rent I was
shocked to receive a letter stating I had to move out. </p>
<p>Why? Because I did not have a guarantor.<span>  Being a single mum with no parents or
grandparents I had no one to step up and support us.  </span></p>
<p>Even my children’s fathers would not put their name on a
piece of paper.</p>
<p>On the 20<sup>th</sup> January 2015 I stood outside my
home and held a demonstration.<span>  </span></p>
<p>No one was listening.<span> 
A lone voice crying out for her children.  </span></p>
<p>I stood there in the cold with my art installation
outside representing loss of childhood.</p>
<p>After our incredible and sad journey, to move would have
been a tragedy and it could have been anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>I even created a huge banner trying to get “Rusty
Rockets” attention.<span>  Clearly my voice was
not loud enough even for Russell Brand.</span></p>
<p>Thankfully I won the right to stay. The homeowner was sympathetic
and I will always be thankful that she let me stay.<span>  But why, in 2015, should a mother of four
children have to stand outside her house and demonstrate?</span></p>
<p>We still live daily under the worry the house will be
sold and we will once again be asked to leave.</p>
<p>I’m not interested in careers or promises or political
experience: I am interested in results.<span>  I
am interested in providing a home for my children.</span></p>
<p>Things have to change and if it means me rolling up my
sleeves to make that happen: then so be it. </p>
<p>I care about the lone voice.<span>  The single parent.  The working class families.  The homeless and those struggling in London
to make ends meet while the economic divide ever increases.</span></p>
<p>Above all: I play fair.<span> 
I know how to balance a budget on tight purse strings and I know how to
divide resources equally.</span></p>
<p>I do this every day.</p>

SINOPSIS
           Esta obra abarca, con bastantes pocos pelos en la lengua, varios aspectos de la sociedad española actual. Se trata de una crítica de valores y normas ya obsoletos que llevamos arrastrando mucho tiempo y que en mi parecer deberían cambiar y se debería hablar de ellos, por eso los saco a la palestra y así procuro fomentar la autocrítica desde un punto de máxima humildad.
 
Conceptualismo crítico.
           Se trata de un lenguaje que sirve de conducto para apelar a los sentimientos y a las emociones a través de un arte conceptual, simbólico, con objetos cotidianos y cercanos perfectamente identificables por todos pero con un significado distinto al habitual; se trata de objetos que pierden parte de su identidad para formar parte de un concepto mayor, son objetos que crecen en significado. Todo esto lo realizo desde un punto de vista crítico, no pasivo, en el que la gente tiene que hacer un pequeño esfuerzo para captar la esencia de la obra y así llegar a un debate interno sobre las ideas preestablecidas y lo que es moral y socialmente justo.
 
Significado y obra.
            La forma de percibir el arte es un proceso muy personal e íntimo, en el que cada individuo es capaz de captar las formas, los colores, la luz, los objetos,… de manera única, por ello creo que el artista no debe obligar al espectador a sentir algo determinado. Creo que la finalidad del arte es hacer sentir, incluso cosas que no querías sentir, con esto un artista puede estar satisfecho y por lo tanto, para mí, la obra puede tener tantos significados como espectadores, ya que si para una persona significa una cosa y para otra persona otra, los dos tienen razón, pues lo que están experimentando en ambos casos es real.

<h3>Concept:</h3>
<p><i>Take Care</i> is a collection of photographs representing the reclamation of autonomy for sexual trauma survivors while challenging one's understanding of objects and color through a created visual language.  The photographs are ambiguous, playful, and bring visibility to the topic of sexual trauma. The title of the project is ambiguous in its own nature – it references the notion that we as humans must take care of ourselves after a traumatic event, whatever that may mean to the individual; however, it is also used to reference the phrase ""Take Care"", used to say our goodbyes to someone. The second meaning is particularly impactful to the artist in ridding herself of the negativity that has weighed her down for the past decade. <i>Take Care</i> creates a space for survivors of sexual trauma to say their goodbyes, literal or metaphorical, to the beings and situations that have so deeply changed their lives.</p> <h3>Here's Where the Funding is Going:</h3>
</div><div>
<p>In order to have the most effective impact, these photographs need to be printed large (40""x60"", with the exception of a few that will be smaller). Funding will primarily help cover costs of the frames, renting and preparing the gallery exhibit, and obtaining white shelves for 12-18 sculptural banana figures that will be displayed on the wall. </p>
<p>Any extra money funded will go toward the creation of a fine art magazine for artists who are recovering from sexual trauma specifically. This magazine will provide even more visibility to the topic of sexual trauma and show how artists are overcoming their experiences through creative processes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project gives visibility to the effects of sexual trauma and allows a safe space for healing. With your donation, you will be supporting an artist with a desire to use her voice to help those struggling with the effects of trauma.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risk-Taker</h3>
<p>The biggest risk I've taken with this project has been allowing myself to be vulnerable with my emotions. I have also gone outside of my realm of comfortability with making sculptural objects. After a period of trial and error, and many failures, I finally succeeded. That in itself means so much to myself as an artist. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help financially, it would be greatly appreciated if you share this project with your friends! :) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>*With your donation of any amount, your name (if provided) will be included on a Contributors List in the printed exhibition catalog for my show to express my full gratitude. If you choose a donation with a perk, you will also receive that perk no later than June of 2017. </p>

Commons Studio intends to be the leading provider of Professional Portraits in Central Ohio. Professional Portraits by Commons Studio © 2016How it Works and What We're All AboutOur goal is to book 100 Professional Portraits with paying clients in order to give 100 Professional Portraits to the beneficiaries of our nonprofit partners. Shot for Shot® is the starting point for what drives us as a social enterprise. It’s a familiar BuyOne-GiveOne model you may already know — TOMS, Warby Parker, our friends at Aunt Flow, and many more. Every time you get a shot with us, we are able to give someone in need a shot at improving their personal brand.In today's digital world of social networks, image is more important than ever. There was a recent study posted on LifeHacker.com discovering that job recruiters spend more time looking at profile photos on LinkedIn rather than vital career information. Without a good photo to represent who you are online, that's a lot like acing the test in real life but forgetting to sign your name. We partner with career development nonprofits to provide the men and women they serve with complimentary Professional Portraits to help them along on their path of employment.  All of our images are high-quality and beautifully retouched. Every client receives the same respect and warm experience. Commons Studio is the world's only Shot for Shot® photography studio and the first to be career and community focused on both sides of the lens™. Cause Impact team photo by Commons Studio © 2016""Commons Studio delivered great group and individual photos for us. They did a fantastic job capturing our people's personalities and company culture, and made the whole experience a pleasure. We look forward to working with them again."" Sean McGeeCause Impact, Managing Principal Dress for Success Women2Women Mentoring photos by Commons Studio © 2016“Dress for Success Columbus prides itself in treating every woman who enters our doors with kindness, respect and the dignity they deserve. When Commons Studio offered to take professional headshots of six of our amazing clients, we jumped at the chance. Matt and his team created a “private party” for six women where they were made to feel beautiful. The pictures that Matt took that night, still hang in my office. They are reminders of the inner and outward beauty that exists when women feel valued. Thank you Commons Studio for helping us to make this experience available to our deserving clients.”Tracy HarrisonDress for Success Columbus, Vice President 
 Paid ApprenticeshipCommons Studio believes in sharing the best practices that make professional photography a livable career. We offer highly competitive, paid apprenticeship opportunities to individuals who demonstrate exceptional talent, industrious character, and a passion for community impact. It is our goal that the immersive, on-the-job training experience will prepare them with the necessary tools to succeed as creative entrepreneurs and future leaders of the industry.  ""I attribute my personal discoveries about my own work and the future of my career to Matt and my associates at Commons Studio.""Samantha UrellGraduate Student NYU, Intern (2015) and Assistant Project Manager  ""Commons Studio brings photographers together. I’ve had experience with equipment I never worked with before. I met people I would have otherwise never met.""Curtis ColeIntern (2015), Photo Assistant and Second Shooter ""I am able to come in every single week and hone craft through photo and video elements. This internship has really launched me into the career world.""Burke MayneCCAD Grad, Intern (2016) and Video Editor  AAF Luncheon: Barry Chandler photo by Commons Studio © 2016 
Business With A Purpose As a social enterprise, our mission is to produce compelling photo and video content for socially responsible brands, organizations, and individuals; serve our community in partnership with career-development nonprofits; and apprentice the next generation of professional photographers. Business proceeds directly fuel our Shot for Shot® philosophy of giving back which benefits our nonprofit partners and provides funding for paid apprenticeships at the studio. Think of it this way, every time you get a shot with us you’re giving someone on both sides of the lens a shot at building their professional career. That’s really cool  — and doesn’t cost you any extra as a client to receive our high quality of  professional work.Between 2015 and 2016 we have successfully on-boarded many of our founder’s local clients and donated services to the Commons Studio brand. We are up to seven team members with growing interest from many more. This bootstrapped initiative has so far donated over $50,000 worth of services to nonprofit organizations, helped raise more than $10,000 for social causes, and paid out over $42,000 to our team of aspiring young creatives who work with us as contractors. Homeport Voice & Vision Annual Celebration photo by Commons Studio © 2015

<h2>A True Sense Of Freedom</h2>
<p><i>Carly is a professional film photographer and David is a writer, musician and photographer from Vancouver, BC.</i></p>
<p>In Winter 2015, we caught the last ferry to a farm on Vancouver Island to buy an old white school bus that looked like it hadn't been started in years. It was covered under a blue tarp and a blanket of snow, and the owner had to find jumper cables with his flashlight to start the bus up. Without  a clue what we were getting ourselves into, we took a chance, bought it, and slept on the floor of the bus that night on the side of the road. We fell asleep with an overwhelming sense of excitement and possibility. With a (very) small budget, borrowed tools, no prior knowledge, and 100 trips to the hardware store, we've created our dream home on wheels that we now live in all year round. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483078116/d7hdk2pycrdnmn8srswv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Until last year, we both had demanding jobs, too many bills, and apartments filled with stuff we didn't need... Now we believe in a different way of life; one where you're free to live out your wildest dreams and able to create and explore without restraint. Moving into our school bus and leaving our jobs have given us the freedom to dedicate our lives to our passions - film photography, writing, music, leatherwork, art, culture. Our hope is that through our story, you see that you are truly free to live any life you can imagine. It doesn't matter what your life currently looks like now, or how far away your dreams seem. </p>

<p>Astral Dust will be a high quality photo book featuring honest film photography, poetry written as we are in the moments, and a window into our lifestyle on the open road. Creating the book will take us off the beaten path to experience the American Southwest, uninhibited, through painted corners of the desert at sunset, roadside diners with red-lipped waitresses, disheveled bedrooms of fashion models, abandoned mansions, truck stops, run down motels, strangers' living rooms, cosmic music festivals...</p>
<p>Why Film?</p>
<p>Film photography captures the soul of individuals and spirit of the landscape in a way that modern processes can't. The light leaks, lens flares, dust and grain are all carried through the process of film photography and show the mood, energy and temperature of the environment in the image. </p>

<h2>Your Support</h2>
<p>Whether it be financial or moral, your support means the world to us. If you aren't able to contribute by pre-ordering our book, sharing our story with friends and family would go along away. If you do find yourself curious about our project and would like to support, here is how the funds will be spent to bring Astral Dust to life:</p>
<p><strong>75% Publishing + Printing + Shipping: </strong>It's important for us to remain in creative control of this project so we've decided to self-publish our book. At least half of the funds will go towards publishing, printing and shipping the final products to those of you who have pre-ordered. <br/><br/><strong>20% Film + Developing: </strong>There are significant costs involved when shooting film, so a portion of the funds will be allocated to purchasing and processing the film while we're on the road. </p>
<p><strong>5% Miscellaneous: </strong>We've done our best to consider all costs, but like any new endeavour, there are always guaranteed to be additional things to pay for. A small portion will go towards the unexpected. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire funding goal, the project will still continue and all prints, books, keychains etc. will still be delivered.</p>
<h2>The Goods </h2>
<h3>Astral Dust Photography Book</h3>
<p>Our book will be printed in soft cover, hard cover and Ebook format. The book will be a minimum of 100 pages blending film photos, poetry and stories from our journey and the people we meet. </p>

A True Sense Of Freedom
Carly is a professional film photographer and David is a writer, musician and photographer from Vancouver, BC.
In Winter 2015, we caught the last ferry to a farm on Vancouver Island to buy an old white school bus that looked like it hadn't been started in years. It was covered under a blue tarp and a blanket of snow, and the owner had to find jumper cables with his flashlight to start the bus up. Without  a clue what we were getting ourselves into, we took a chance, bought it, and slept on the floor of the bus that night on the side of the road. We fell asleep with an overwhelming sense of excitement and possibility. With a (very) small budget, borrowed tools, no prior knowledge, and 100 trips to the hardware store, we've created our dream home on wheels that we now live in all year round. 

Until last year, we both had demanding jobs, too many bills, and apartments filled with stuff we didn't need... Now we believe in a different way of life; one where you're free to live out your wildest dreams and able to create and explore without restraint. Moving into our school bus and leaving our jobs have given us the freedom to dedicate our lives to our passions - film photography, writing, music, leatherwork, art, culture. Our hope is that through our story, you see that you are truly free to live any life you can imagine. It doesn't matter what your life currently looks like now, or how far away your dreams seem.

<h2><u>Visible Girls - The Story</u></h2>
<p>Beyond the fascinating stories of the Visible Girls’ lives in those intervening 36 years, this show aims to encourage and celebrate self-expression in all women regardless of age.</p>
<p>Women’s subcultural history is largely untold. As a 22-year old photographer in the early 1980s, Anita Corbin felt the irresistible drive to document those girl-punks, mods, skins, rockers, Rastas and young lesbians, ensuring that their individuality and power were fiercely represented.  All around her, a grassroots energy in 1980’s Britain was being expressed through shaved head and scooter, Mohican and musical taste, style and sexual orientation; girls being themselves, wearing what they wanted to wear, rebelling, <i>living</i> life. All of it back-dropped and fuelled by Thatcher’s Britain, the Brixton Riots and the Miners’ Strike. She called the resulting collection:<i> Visible Girls</i>.</p>
<p>The<i> Visible Girls: Revisited</i> touring exhibition sets those original images next to brand new photographs of the women those girls became. This time, however, they are back-dropped by Brexit, Britain’s 2nd female Prime Minister and terrorist attacks as daily news.</p>
<p>The contrasts and similarities between the two sets of images evoke a deep sense of female tribal allegiance across generation and gender. This show promotes the spirit of female friendship, courage, and non-conformism, as well as the effects of living as a woman in a changing Britain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498837585/qm47qdocf9hnpyouxhdr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong>The Exhibition</strong></u></h3>
<p>The exhibition showcases the vibrant style and music-driven tribal allegiances of the 1980s as well as the deeper issues of belonging and womanhood.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The original images are hugely evocative; the vibe of the 1980’s writ large in hairstyles, clothes, makeup, cigarettes, pub toilets and graffiti. The new images make a brilliant, thought-provoking contrast. The touring exhibition uses 1980s set design, memorabilia and original tape-recordings of the girls talking about what it was like to be in a subculture. There are also new interviews with the ‘women’ as they are now reflecting on how it feels to have once been a partying skinhead or a scooter club mod…and to now be a mother of four or a high-flying lawyer.</p>
<p>As far as possible, the girls are in their original pairs photographed in (often) the same locations.</p>
<p>This exhibition has the power to inspire. We want it to be accessible, showing in community spaces in as many locations as possible UK-wide so that through these Visible Girls, women everywhere can celebrate their individuality - despite what society tells them they ‘should’ be. In this modern age where most ‘tribes’ are online, this show will also encourage women to think about the nature of friendships and what it is to have a tribe.</p>
<p>This is a growing exhibition – as more girls from the original shots are tracked down their photographs and interviews will be added to the next phase of the show.</p>
<p>Each stop on the tour will offer interactive workshops to empower young women. There will also be pop-up street-side photo sessions to capture the Visible Girls and Boys of every place we visit for our Instagram feed!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>What we need &amp; what you get!</u></h3>
<p>We need your support to help us fund the on-going, 3-year UK touring exhibition.</p>
<p><i>In return for your support, you can choose to receive a reward (scroll down for the complete list on the right-hand side of this page and view our image gallery at the top of the page.)</i></p>
<p>Style, tribe and self-expression have influenced our collection of unique, limited edition rewards. These include t-shirts, tote bags, limited edition signed exhibition catalogues and prints.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>How we use the funds</u></p>
<p>We want this show to reach the Visible Girls (and Boys) of as many places countrywide as possible and for exhibition entry to stay free to all.</p>

<p> - Growing the exhibition as we discover new Visible Girls.</p>
<p> - Printing and framing.</p>
<p>-  Public empowerment workshops.</p>

The Team
 

Photographer: Anita Corbin
Anita has been a photographer for 36 years and has travelled worldwide generating iconic images for business and the media including The Sunday Times and The Observer magazines.
""When I took the original images I was determined that these vibrant, strong young women should claim their place in photographic history. I want the new images to say that who we once were isn’t lost, but necessarily informs who we become.""
 
 
 

Curator: Tory Turk 
Tory is creative lead at the world famous Hyman Archive and curated the well-publicised exhibitions, ‘The Jam: About the Young Idea’ and ‘A Street Style Journey’.""This exhibition showcases a hugely moving and powerful part of social history. Women’s voices and their history – especially their subcultures - have rarely been shown or explored in this way. It enables young women to come into a positive relationship with age and older women to reconnect to their adolescent selves who formed the bedrock of their wisdom.""
 
 

Writer: Deborah Willimott 
Deborah is a freelance editorial director and magazine writer and has contributed to GLAMOUR, Cosmopolitan, The Huffington Post, Stylist, The Guardian Weekend Magazine, more! and Men’s Health.
""Music and fashion can sometimes appear superficial, but really they are a universal language of self-expression, making them powerful conduits for unity and relationship across ages and generations – this exhibition isn’t just about great story telling but a gateway to self-understanding""
 

Designer: Lucy May
A freelance art director and graphic designer who has overseen and worked on campaigns for the Barbican, Whitechapel Gallery, Royal Court Theatre and Manchester Art Gallery
""The photographs are not only aesthetically beautiful but intriguing. They make us want to know more about these people's stories. The project is like a time capsule its far-reaching themes will still be relevant in another 36 years""
How we use the funds
We want this show to reach the Visible Girls (and Boys) of as many places countrywide as possible and for exhibition entry to stay free to all.
We need money for:
 - Physically travelling the show around the UK.
 - Growing the exhibition as we discover new Visible Girls.
 - Printing and framing.
-  Public empowerment workshops.
 - Development of an education package for school groups.
 - Production of the ‘London’ edition of the catalogue in 2018.
- Production of the Visible Girls Documentary film series.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>My first trip to Georgia was in 2011 – and ever since, I’ve been working on this project. First out of a fascination for this unknown country, it was like they say, if you come to Georgia once, you will come back. Year over year this fascination grew into curiosity and the wish to know and understand more.</p>
<p>When I was thinking about making a book of this long-term project, I soon realized that my point of view alone would not suffice - I wanted to go deeper. Which led to the idea to invite Georgian artists, photographers and writers, to collaborate on the book – and my question to them was: If I asked you about Georgia, which story would you tell me?</p>
<p>These stories are collected in the book „Tamar, where are you?“ – and are put in dialogue with my photographs. Through this juxtaposition of inside versus outside view, we get a deeper insight into this truly fascinating country.</p>
<p>With contributions by:<br/>Ana Kordzaia-Samadashvili, Dato Turashvili, Dina Oganova, Giorgi Shengelia, Giorgi Tabliashvili, Guram Tsibakhashvili, Natela Grigalashvili, Tinatin Kiguradze, Vakho Khetaguri, Yuri Mechitov</p>

<h3><strong>Why the collaboration</strong></h3>
<p>When you want to approach a country photographically, what is the best way to do it? As a photographer, your perception is always influenced by your origin, your perspective is directed by your cultural background. So the question is, whether or not it is possible to photographically grasp a country and a culture that is not your own.</p>
<p>When you're traveling to Georgia it is easy to be overwhelmed by the country's beauty and the hospitality of the Georgians, the legend says that any guest was sent from god and this is how travelers are greeted. But what if you take a deeper look, a look at what life is really like in Georgia, in the cities or on the country side? How do Georgians perceive their lives, what are the developments, where are the challenges posed by the reality in Georgia?</p>
<p>With this project I'm looking for answers to questions like these - but with my perspective put in dialogue with the stories of the Georgian artists, we create an exchange of positions and that always leads to a better understanding.</p>

<p>The photography is mostly documentary style, but there's not only a mix of colour and b&amp;w photography, but also of journalistic and more conceptual images.

<p>And then there's the essays, written by Georgian authors, which provide another layer to the understanding of Georgia - there's a short personal overview over the history of Georgia by Dato Turashvili, a free essay by Ana Kordzaia-Samadashvili and a very personal description of what life feels like in Georgia, written by the artist Giorgi Tabliashvili.</p>

<p>Hey! I’m Karolina and that’s my story </p>
<p>For over a decade I’ve been organizing my life around travel and photography. It all began when I was 13 and out of thin air came the idea of becoming a photographer. I got my first camera from my parents who have ever since been encouraging my arts interests. I read countless books and attended many lectures to learn how a good photograph is done. Finally, I was very lucky enough, right after finishing high school and having passed all the exams I was enlisted into the most important and respected film school in Poland - Polish National Film School in Łódź. And this is where my actual photographic adventure started.</p>
<p>During my university years, most of my output has been about people and some sort of documentary road projects. So was my life. Split into two - photographing and traveling.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502315061/xxngbfctjp8k8emrhlx9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>How did I collect money for that?</p>
<p>Along with my studies, I have been doing a lot of commercial work - shooting stills for the movies, sets or some lookbook fashion pictures for small enterprises. Some of my photographs have even won cash prices so I could pay for my next travel costs. I’m used to a tight budget life as a rule, usually do a secondhand shopping and avoid eating out in fancy restaurants. When traveling, I quite often choose a hitch-hike or couch surfing. Once I even hired myself out for a 6-month contract as a ship photographer for Carnival Cruise lines. All of the money I have been making so far, helped me finance my travels and passion for photography in general. This year is the biggest challege I have ever faced, therefore it needs careful preparations. I want everything to be perfectly organized. This is going to be an advanture of a lifetime, so I count on your support !</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502309468/uvuqupgvgmf7d4do22vu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This year is special for me, because it’s the last semester and I have to prepare my own photographic Master’s Degree creative project. I have always had this dream about „Into the Wild” road project. And this is what my diploma topic is about. I want to go across Canada, towards Alaska and than back to the USA; following masters of American road photography, Alec Soth or Ryan McGinley. I want to construct my own vision of the places I’m about to see and people I will meet. I'm also very inspired by Jack Kerouac stories, all that simplicity and levity of being on the road. I wish I could join him just for a while, Im sure it would be the story of my life. The dreaming is for the dreamers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502315106/npfizvpbshnaflmycalb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> I am really thrilled by the prospects of meeting new folks, listening to their stories, exploring new places, and finally, being able to put it all into visual documentary. Beside experiencing the trip as itself, having an exhibition and passing my MD exams.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502315175/b0gtdcexckgnluhrsoji.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I’m definitely too curious about the world and its people to sit quietly at home, in Warsaw. Because of my final exams and written Master’s Degree thesis schedule, I decided to do something much bigger than i did before, that’s why I need YOU! I hope I’m gonna make my dream come true with your help!!!!</p>

Once I even hired myself out for a 6-month contract as a ship photographer for Carnival Cruise lines. All of the money I have been making so far, helped me finance my travels and passion for photography in general. This year is the biggest challege I have ever faced, therefore it needs careful preparations. I want everything to be perfectly organized. This is going to be an advanture of a lifetime, so I count on your support !

This year is special for me, because it’s the last semester and I have to prepare my own photographic Master’s Degree creative project. I have always had this dream about „Into the Wild” road project. And this is what my diploma topic is about. I want to go across Canada, towards Alaska and than back to the USA; following masters of American road photography, Alec Soth or Ryan McGinley. I want to construct my own vision of the places I’m about to see and people I will meet. I'm also very inspired by Jack Kerouac stories, all that simplicity and levity of being on the road. I wish I could join him just for a while, Im sure it would be the story of my life. The dreaming is for the dreamers.

 I am really thrilled by the prospects of meeting new folks, listening to their stories, exploring new places, and finally, being able to put it all into visual documentary. Beside experiencing the trip as itself, having an exhibition and passing my MD exams.

I’m definitely too curious about the world and its people to sit quietly at home, in Warsaw. Because of my final exams and written Master’s Degree thesis schedule, I decided to do something much bigger than i did before, that’s why I need YOU! I hope I’m gonna make my dream come true with your help!!!!

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>About myself</strong> <strong>:</strong> </p>
<p>I am a wildlife enthusiast and a photographer residing in Bangalore, India. My love for nature and wildlife started in the year 2013 and ever since then I have been traveling to different wildlife reserves and sanctuaries. What started as a curiosity endeavour has now turned into a life-long purpose. During the past seven years I have spent most of my time in the wild, photographing birds and mammals. My limited edition fine-art prints have been showcased and featured on books and Art galleries of India.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of my work have been documenting in depth, the life of the most enigmatic and elusive wildlife in India; be it  the Royal Bengal Tiger, the majestic Tuskers or a plethora of Avifauna. Some of these images are featured in this book.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>About the book :</strong> </p>
<p>Forest Archives is my first attempt towards publishing a coffee table book. With your support through this Indiegogo campaign, Forest Archives will be a 160-page fine-art wildlife photography book, containing about 200 of the most evocative and beautiful images from wildlife sanctuaries and tiger reserves of India. </p>
<p>Forest Archives will feature color images. Through this book the reader will be exposed to natural diversity, pristine wildlife reserves, vast landscapes, and get an insight into the lives of the Fauna that thrives amidst the Indian jungles. </p>
<p>This book features images primarily from India, the fauna that thrives across the pristine wildlife reserves &amp; its vast landscapes. The beautiful topography, consisting of foothills of the Himalayan Range, the valleys in the Western Ghats, the Grasslands of Central India and the arid regions of the Gulf of Kutch, are the core elements of the book. The book is not based on any particular animal or species but focuses exclusively on the emotional and metaphorical power of the images and how they contribute to tell the story. </p>
<p>This book puts forth a message of art, beauty, and conservation through its characters and their stories. With every turning page, the reader unfolds the journey of an individual character, making them ask some questions about nature, learn a little bit about animal traits and have an understanding that, from the branches of a tree to the neurons in our brain, we are all connected – and that is the conservation aspect of this book.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Vision</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>The core idea is to be able to share some of the natural history moments with you from some of the remote corners of the country. In recent years, thanks to the Conservation activities in places such as Africa and the Polar regions, things are now changing for good.</p>
<p>The appalling austerities, however, which the Indian wildlife has been subjected to by humans, has reached a tipping point, where after it could very easily become a record of things that we stand to lose. We are losing forests and animal habitats - Like soil in a garden, which is home to the critically endangered species such as Tigers and Elephants.</p>
<p>One of the prime reasons for choosing a coffee table book format with engaging pictures and stories was with the intention of capturing the reader's attention and informing them about the alarming issues related to Wildlife in India.</p>

<h3>Our Campaign</h3> <p>Most of the individuals that we feature in Portraits live in our home state of California. However, from the start, we wanted our book to feature formerly undocumented professionals and leaders from throughout the country. We are honored to have the involvement of professionals such as Dr. Harold Fernandez, a professor of surgery and director of the Heart Institute at the Stony Brook School of Medicine in New York. We have been inspired the leadership of Isabel Castillo, a young woman from Virginia who did not let her undocumented status stop her from advocating for her rights and the rights of others; she later received an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco. </p>
<p>As editors of Portraits of the Dream, we pour our own ""sweat equity"" into putting the stories together. Our real cost is the photography, especially when it comes to conducting photo shoots with individuals who live out-of-state. All of the proceeds from our campaign would go toward the fees and travel costs needed to fly Michael Collopy outside of California, and cover a few in-state photo shoots. Neither of the editors will retain any of the proceeds from this campaign.</p>
<p>By supporting our campaign, particularly at the $125 level or more, you will get early access to the printed version of the book as it is released (signed by the editors and Michael Collopy). All supporters of our campaign become part of the Portraits family. You will receive regular updates of the progress of the book, and preview excerpts and photos (for personal use only). You will be notified of events that feature some of the professionals and leaders profiled in our book (particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California). Our highest supporters will get access to awesome incentives like a photo shoot with Michael Collopy or a unique wine country tour at Latino-owned vineyards in Napa with the editors and Michael Collopy.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we would still use whatever proceeds earned from this campaign to fund the photography of Portraits of the Dream. We would likely have to focus more exclusively on people residing in California. Migrant communities, however, can be found throughout the United States, and we want the individuals featured in our book to reflect this geographic diversity. </p>

The latter book offers the most comprehensive photographic documentation of the work of Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity published.

Our Campaign Most of the individuals that we feature in Portraits live in our home state of California. However, from the start, we wanted our book to feature formerly undocumented professionals and leaders from throughout the country. We are honored to have the involvement of professionals such as Dr. Harold Fernandez, a professor of surgery and director of the Heart Institute at the Stony Brook School of Medicine in New York. We have been inspired the leadership of Isabel Castillo, a young woman from Virginia who did not let her undocumented status stop her from advocating for her rights and the rights of others; she later received an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco. 
As editors of Portraits of the Dream, we pour our own ""sweat equity"" into putting the stories together. Our real cost is the photography, especially when it comes to conducting photo shoots with individuals who live out-of-state. All of the proceeds from our campaign would go toward the fees and travel costs needed to fly Michael Collopy outside of California, and cover a few in-state photo shoots. Neither of the editors will retain any of the proceeds from this campaign.
By supporting our campaign, particularly at the $125 level or more, you will get early access to the printed version of the book as it is released (signed by the editors and Michael Collopy). All supporters of our campaign become part of the Portraits family. You will receive regular updates of the progress of the book, and preview excerpts and photos (for personal use only). You will be notified of events that feature some of the professionals and leaders profiled in our book (particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California). Our highest supporters will get access to awesome incentives like a photo shoot with Michael Collopy or a unique wine country tour at Latino-owned vineyards in Napa with the editors and Michael Collopy.
If we do not reach our goal, we would still use whatever proceeds earned from this campaign to fund the photography of Portraits of the Dream. We would likely have to focus more exclusively on people residing in California. Migrant communities, however, can be found throughout the United States, and we want the individuals featured in our book to reflect this geographic diversity.

Risks & Challenges

 As we know, coordinating a project with working professionals is hard. We have had to reschedule interviews or photo shoots at times because appointments fall through and life happens (not to mention our own schedules). Our biggest obstacle, however, is obtaining the funding needed to complete our project. Having financial backing will allow us to assure our prospective publishers that the photographic component of our project will be completed as we finalize the draft of the manuscript.

<h3>Who? What? Why?<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>My name is Misha
Vallejo, I am an Ecuadorian photographer, member of the <a href=""http://www.runaphotos.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Runa Photos</a> collective.
Last year I shot a <b>documentary</b> project about the everyday life of a small
Ecuadorean village located on the border with Colombia. Colombians <b>fleeing
violence</b> from fights between the FARC guerrilla and the government crossed the
border to Ecuador and founded this village in 2001. </p>
<p>This region
has been affected by tabloid reporters that only come here when they
run out of news to fill their papers. I thought that Puerto Nuevo deserves
a more dignified place than a hidden page in a sensationalist media, and a
<b>book</b>, usually considered a valuable object, is more <b>appropriate to tell their story</b>.</p>This year I presented the book project to the <a href=""http://www.fundacionmuseosquito.gob.ec/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">City Museums Foundation of Quito</a>
and <b>won</b> the <a href=""http://www.premiomarianoaguilera.gob.ec/?p=971"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">National Arts Prize</a> Nuevo Mariano Aguilera, which will give me the
funds to print it. Other important partners include the Brazilian publishing
house <a href=""http://estudiomadalena.com.br/editora/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Editora Madalena</a> and the<a href=""http://oeiecuador.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Iberoamerican States Organization</a> for Education,
Science and Culture. I appreciate their support, however,
there is a small deficit to <b>cover</b> design and distribution <b>costs</b> which are the
reasons for this crowdfunding campaign.
I am sure that with your support, this project
will generate awareness about a very important issue but which is rarely
discussed.
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What we need and what you get<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>All the funds
gathered with your support will go towards financing the design and
distribution costs of the book. <span>The funds to
print</span> the book are secured, that
means that even if the goal is not achieved, <b>the book will still be printed</b>.
(It may take a bit longer to distribute though). </p>
<p>The book launch
in Ecuador will take place at the Contemporary Arts Centre in Quito and it is
estimated to be in February 2016. What I am offering you is the chance to get it way before that, together with other <b>valuable rewards</b>, such as the
original signed and numbered book dummies, of which I printed 30 copies
and there are only 8 left or the WAKA photography journal together with the book at a really low price. This campaign is more or less a <b>presale</b> of the book.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The impact</h3>
<p>I believe this
is an under reported subject and it is important for Latin America and the world to know it. Your contribution will allow the book to be distributed
faster and to a <b>broader audience</b>. 
<br/>
</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks and challenges</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>There are virtually <b>no risks</b>. The
production costs are 80% covered. If I don't reach the goal I will invest my
own money (which I don't really have) to pay for the design, and then, will
distribute the book little by little. <b>This may take longer, but the book will
still be out.</b></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other ways you can help </h3> <p></p>
</div>
I know these are complicated
times for photography and the arts in general. I know it because I have seen
loads of crowdfunding campaigns, which I would have loved to contribute to, but
didn't have the funds to do it. This is why if you were short of money, I would
appreciate it if you could spread the word to your friends and family and <b>share
it </b>with your social network (Facebook, Twitter, etc).<br/><h3><br/></h3><h3>PS</h3>The cost of the book is equivalent to a pint and a burger in any pub of London or to the cost of a dinner for one person in Quito. But take into account that <b>this book will stay with you</b> much longer than that food. <b>:)</b><br/><p></p></div>","Who? What? Why?

<p>The strongest of us suffer in silence…this is most true when it comes to our courageous veterans.  Trained and expected to always be perfectly strong – an utter impossibility - it is no surprise that many of our service men and women end up perfectly broken.  They who have risked all for our peace of mind need our help to heal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PERFECTLY BROKEN – a photojournalistic narrative - aims to do just that by shining a visual light upon that which has been hidden for far too long – veterans who suffer in silence.  Together we can let them know that they are NOT alone. Now we can help them break their silence – and garner wider awareness of the suffering – by bringing their stories to the world.  PERFECTLY BROKEN is a photojournalistic series that tells the stories of US veterans silently suffering PTSD, MST, and those driven to suicide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We all know that serving in the military is tough…that going into combat is terrifying…that living with the terror of having to kill or be killed is beyond comprehension for most.  But what many do not realize is the range and depth of the horrors and the ongoing impact of such service to mankind.  That the percentage of veterans suffering PTSD is, on average, 10%+ higher than the national average rate…that less than 50% seek/receive treatment…that those who seek treatment only have a 50/50 chance of receiving “adequate” help…that MST (Military Sexual Trauma) even exists…and that the traumas continue to be evident and life affecting even 25 years after service.  So now it’s time to help our society see the truth of how tough it really is…that’s what PERFECTLY BROKEN was created to do.</p>
<p>PTSD, or Post traumatic Stress Disorder, is a psychiatric disorder that can occur following the experience or witnessing of a life-threatening events such as military combat, natural disasters, terrorist incidents, serious accidents, or physical or sexual assault in adult or childhood. The VA estimates that PTSD afflicts, on average, 17% of military personnel.  Military sexual trauma, or MST, is the term used by VA to refer to experiences of sexual assault or repeated/threatening sexual harassment experienced during military service.  In 2014 alone over 20,000 members of the military were sexually assaulted. And, according to the 2012 VA's Suicide Data Report we lose 8,000 per year to suicide…that is 22 per day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PERFECTLY BROKEN is all about authentic truth and the courage of these astoundingly strong men and women who have agreed to shared their stories, their sacred truths, and their pain with the world. These are things not easily shared, as they carry a lot of shame and stigma… painful experiences that have effected every aspect their lives and their loved ones.  But they are brave and will allow PERFECTLY BROKEN to capture their purest pain…visit them where they live…see them at their most vulnerable…and share their secrets with the world.  </p>
<p>Across the country veterans have recognized the value and import of PERFECTLY BROKEN, have volunteered to share in the hopes of bringing healing to themselves, their loved ones and those whom their service has protected – YOU. We hope for the opportunity to meet and immortalize each and every one of them.  </p>
<p>It is huge undertaking that we are prepared to commit to for as long as it takes.  PERFECTLY BROKEN will connect the world with ten veterans at a time for as long as the funding lasts.  Each series of ten will highlight a wide and intersectional range of veterans.</p>
<p>The 10 stories told in the first PERFECTLY BROKEN series: include members from each branch of the military; encompass veterans ranging in age from 25 to 60; cross ethnic and cultural lines multiple; and is evenly divided between women and men from a range of positions and postings.  </p>
<p>To journey to each of the veterans that have volunteered, visually document their narratives, and artistically produce their part of the series costs $1000 per veteran.  All donations will be utilized solely for travel, production, promotion, additional equipment and supplies for the first series. Wherever possible costs will be minimized through sensible logistic management and any additional funds will be utilized for the next series.</p>
<p>Ian Frank, creator of and photojournalistic artist for PERFECTLY BROKEN, has over  two decade of commercial photographic and filmmaking experience.  Nearly a decade ago he left the commercial photography world to utilize his art and abilities in service to others.  But service is nothing new for Ian, he too is a Disabled United States Marine Corps Veteran with PTSD, and knows what it's like to suffer in silence until attempting suicide. So, as you can imagine, this project is not only artistically important to him but deeply personal as well. He’s knows there are others out there like them, suffering from similar or worse situations. Ian was inspired to create PERFECTLY BROKEN to help ease their pain and shed light on their need for healing.</p>
<p>While we cannot all offer the courage, commitment, and care of country that Ian and his sisters and brothers in arms have; we CAN help bring this project to full fruition.  So give what you can, share this campaign wherever you wish, and let’s show the world and our veterans that they need suffer alone no more. We, and our perfectly human veterans, thank you.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Hannah Mentz and I’m an award-winning photographer who grew up in Zimbabwe. I’m running this campaign to help fund the printing costs of a self-published book about the personal project I’ve been working on for the past two years called Great Zimbabweans. Every supporter who chooses the buy a book option will receive a copy of the limited-edition coffee-table book of the  Great Zimbabweans project.</p>
<p>The Great Zimbabweans project is a positive and inspiring portrayal (portraits and interviews) of 40 Great Zimbabweans - one for every year of Zimbabwe's 40 years of Independence in 2020. I wanted to create this project to be an antidote to the largely negative depressing narrative about Zimbabwe that one sees in the media. Zimbabweans need something to uplift them and hoping that this project may be able to throw a positive light on all Zimbabwean people, their achievements and many talents.</p>
</div><div>
<p>This campaign will help me achieve my dream of publishing the Great Zimbabweans project as a book which means a lot to me on many levels- it would be my first-ever published book but on top of that, because the project is about Zimbabwean people, I would love to be able to share this body of work with as many people as possible. I believe the collective voices of my participants are very powerful and may offer different ways of looking at the country, looking at a different future and celebrating Zimbabwean identity. </p>
<p>My goal is to achieve between 200-500 pre-orders of the book (EUR5,000-7,500) by the end of December 2020 which will allow me to take the book to print mid January 2021, estimated to ship in April 2021. As a thank to my supporters, there will be a 7x5 gift print from the project with every copy of the book ordered. There won't be any risks to the campaign. If my minimum is not met, I will still be able to go ahead and fulfill the pledges, but on a smaller scale and with digital printing of the book rather than litho printing. </p>
<p>I understand if you just can't contribute, but you can still help me by getting the word out about the Great Zimbabweans project and following it on Instagram on @greatzimbabweans2020 </p>

Participate in the publication of this book 
It has always been a dream for me to share my images of Ovahimba culture
with the public at large. During my seven years of life and work with the
Ovahimba, I nurtured the idea of publishing a book featuring the most salient moments
of our life together. Participez à la publication de ce beau livre J'ai toujours rêvé de partager mes images de la culture Ovahimba avec le grand public. Au cours de mes sept années avec les Ovahimba, je pensais déjà à l'idée de publier un livre qui mettrait en avant les temps forts de notre vie commune.

has made a significant and unique contribution toward the preservation and
conservation of the intangible cultural heritage of the Ovahimba and other Otjiherero speaking communities.
The lifestyle and culture of the Ovahimba are fast changing and it is hence
very important for the preservation of world culture to create a living trace
of their intangible cultural heritage. The publication of the book of photographs, The Ovahimba Years – Les Années Ovahimba / Rina Sherman, will help to accomplish this long and vast task, as it will make this heritage available to a large public.La contribution du projet Les années Ovahimba à la culture mondialeDepuis sa création en 1996, le projet Les années Ovahimba a contribué de manière  unique à la préservation du patrimoine culturel des Ovahimba et des communautés de langue Otjiherero. Cette culture tend à disparaître, et c'est pourquoi il est très important  de créer une trace vivante de leur patrimoine culturel immatériel. La publication du livre de photographies, Les années Ovahimba - The Ovahimba Years / Rina Sherman, peut aider à l'accomplissment de cette longue et vaste tâche, car il ouvre ce patrimoine au plus grand nombre.Track Record
Rina Sherman has developed and managed all aspects of the project The Ovahimba Years since 1996: fund raising, administration & management, extensive multimedia fieldwork, training of assistants, building of a community centre now used as a school, and numerous other development projects, publishing films, books, articles, Web sites, etc. She has received sustained support from among others, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the French Ministry of Culture, the French National Centre for Cinema and the Moving Image, The Ford Foundation, and The British High Commission in Namibia, Caltex - Namibia, Gamsberg Macmillan Publishers, Standard Bank and many others. Today her work features in the collections of numerous major university and research libraries, museums and various institutions worldwide. The introduction of her archive in the collections of the French National Library is one further step toward ensuring the perennial conservation of the intangible cultural heritage of the Ovahimba.

</div>
<div>My name is Beth Louise Ross. I attended the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (NSCAD) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. I received my Bachelor of Fine Art (BFA) in mixed media in 2006. It was not a wise financial decision by any means. It was a decision based on where my passions and talents lie. As a mother of 3 boys, my ability to focus my attention and energy on my art-making became strongly interrupted by the lives of my children. I surrendered to the maternal experience completely and my husband became the single income earner in our home. Now, as my children are in school full-time, I am able to more fully turn to my art practice, particularly photography, although I have a slowly growing painting practice as well as a satisfying yoga practice.</div>
<h2>My Work</h2>
<div>I approach the subject matter in my photographs from a point of awe and profound emotional, even spiritual, experience. I am moved by the natural beauty of the world. I am also a very playful person who enjoys colour and visual manipulation, so the process of being outside, capturing the landscape through digital photography, and then returning home to edit is a natural practice for me. My intention is to sell high-resolution prints in various sizes to individuals and businesses, while at the same time, in my own way, expand on the Earth's need to have us humans singing her glorious praises.</div>
<h2>My Challenge</h2>
<div>I am currently using a digital SLR camera that is borrowed from a generous friend. The editing I have done has been accomplished on an iPad, which (as you may know) is great for some things, but ultimately insufficient in terms of being able to display the detail I need to see, the processing power to alter high-resolution images, as well as having the ability to prepare photos for print. I don't have the funds to buy myself what I need, and our household income does not allow for it. So it is to you that I turn to help continue my efforts toward building a successful career in photography.</div>
<h2>My Need</h2>
<div>I need a 27-inch iMac with sufficient processing and RAM speed to work on my photos. This costs $3200 after taxes. I also need Adobe Photoshop to manipulate photos and prepare them for print. Photoshop costs $800 after taxes. My rewards for contributors will cost between $500 and $750. Adding Indiegogo's 5% fee and payment processing fees brings my total to $5350.</div>
<h2>Rewards</h2>
<div>There are two tiers of rewards for contributors. For a $500 contribution, you get a 18"" x 24"", high-resolution, archival print of your choice. For a $250 contribution, you get an 9"" x 12"", high-resolution, archival print also of your choice. Please remember that part of these prices include the costs of printing by archival printers. For any other contributions, I will acknowledge your contribution on my developing website (with your permission) either as an anonymous person or company, or fully disclosed identity. It's your choice.</div><div>*Note about rewards: As I need to acquire the iMac to prepare photos for print, I need to reach my funding goal to fulfill that commitment. However, I've chosen ""flexible funding"" so that contributors have the option of paying by credit card, and not only through Paypal (which may be complicated for some people). This means I get the funds raised even if my goal isn't reached by the end of 60 days. Since I need to reach the goal to provide rewards, I have opted in to Indiegogo's InDemand option, which means that the campaign will stay live until we reach the goal. The only effect on contributors will be a delay in reward shipment.</div>
<h2>Other Help</h2>
<div>If you can't contribute monetarily, you can help by passing along the word and using social networking to expand the population base that can become aware of my campaign.</div>

<b></b><h3><b>Building a Photography Studio that is affordable and cost effective for the community.</b></h3>
<p>Imagine your perfect photo shoot. Where is
it shot? In an affordable studio that allows students, amateurs, and pro photographers a place to rent,
full time, for those dream shoots? </p>
<p>Imagine
white walls and hardwood floors… and not only is it fully furnished with the
perfect amount of natural light while still allowing the option to use studio
light. It gets better; it also has a full-sized changing room with not only
mirrors, but a shower as well… the comfort aspect! </p>
<p>Imagine
being equipped with multiple backdrops, a fire place, multiple A/C outlets and
a separate room all together for portraits… what more could you want? What is
possibly more perfect? Not a lot. This is why we need to make this happen.</p>
<p>Photography has been an excellent way
for myself and many others to help spread the beauty we see daily in our
community.  I want to assist others to achieve excellence in this field,
which we can accomplish by simply having this perfect available studio to
benefit our surrounding communities. It’s easy to reserve and use, with no
obligations or contracts. <br/></p>
<p>Although it is expensive leasing your own studio with all of the
furnishings, Pittsburgh Photo Studio will allow you to have your ideal studio
shoots without breaking the bank. I want you to be able to make the photoshoot that
is in your head a reality. I want to do this without you feeling as though you
can’t make it happen due to financial issues. I want to help your dream shoot
happen, so all I need is you to help my dream business happen. Plus FREE PARKING! There is a parking lot on the premises.<br/></p>
<p>I have worked with companies in Pittsburgh and
worldwide such as Cirque Du Soleil, The National Opera de Paris, The Pittsburgh
Penguins, Pittsburgh Steelers, The Pittsburgh Riverhounds, and the Pittsburgh
Pirates. I worked with Pittsburgh Magazine, Hockey Night in Canada, Versus,
City Theatre, The Pittsburgh Playhouse, The Hazlett Theater and more. 20 plus years
I have been in the entertainment industry and I have found that home is where
the heart is and that is Pittsburgh. This is why I want my dream business to be
in the city that I love.</p>

<p>As melanin women with locs we’ve chosen to go against the grain and create our own mark within the natural hair community. Locs have been around for many many years yet they are still not accepted within the eyes of many individuals. In a world where society's standards of beauty are used to judge our women of color, I want to showcase the many women who choose to wear their hair in its most natural form.</p>
<p>I am honored to invite you to join me in bringing a  project to the masses that will crush the stigma associated with locs and showcase the beauty of Melanin Loc Queens.</p>
<p>50 Shades Of Locs is a photobook/documentary created to empower, encourage, educate and entertain those within the loc community and those who are curious about the queens who choose to loc their hair. This project will answer many of the Who, What, Where, When and Why’s of locs. Your help is needed to bring this project to the masses and create an avenue for women of color to be able to display their confidence with pride.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The natural hair community is being embraced by many individuals daily but yet we have very few artistic outlets that showcase the many beautiful Queens who chose to loc their crowns.</p>
<p> I feel this project Is needed to create a solid movement not just amongst Black women with locs but black women period.</p>
<p>In the world of visual art and documentary I'm using photos to capture the beauty of locs that adorn the many Queens that wear them proudly and who are leaving foot prints in the loc community. </p>
<p>This photobook/documentary project will help showcase locs and melanin in an artistic form that will be a keepsake for many generations to follow. These photos of beautiful loc queens will come from all over the world and these photos will exudes positive energy, spiritual growth, and beauty.  These photos will also display the tangles of ones soul through photographic art.</p>
<p>The documentary will  peep into the world of queens answering questions in regards to the history of locs, the different types of locs, life with locs, what does locs mean in different cultures, the stages of locs, locing methods, loc regimens, loc styles, and so so so much more.

</div></div>","As melanin women with locs we’ve chosen to go against the grain and create our own mark within the natural hair community. Locs have been around for many many years yet they are still not accepted within the eyes of many individuals. In a world where society's standards of beauty are used to judge our women of color, I want to showcase the many women who choose to wear their hair in its most natural form.
I am honored to invite you to join me in bringing a  project to the masses that will crush the stigma associated with locs and showcase the beauty of Melanin Loc Queens.
50 Shades Of Locs is a photobook/documentary created to empower, encourage, educate and entertain those within the loc community and those who are curious about the queens who choose to loc their hair. This project will answer many of the Who, What, Where, When and Why’s of locs. Your help is needed to bring this project to the masses and create an avenue for women of color to be able to display their confidence with pride.

The natural hair community is being embraced by many individuals daily but yet we have very few artistic outlets that showcase the many beautiful Queens who chose to loc their crowns.
 I feel this project Is needed to create a solid movement not just amongst Black women with locs but black women period.
In the world of visual art and documentary I'm using photos to capture the beauty of locs that adorn the many Queens that wear them proudly and who are leaving foot prints in the loc community. 
This photobook/documentary project will help showcase locs and melanin in an artistic form that will be a keepsake for many generations to follow. These photos of beautiful loc queens will come from all over the world and these photos will exudes positive energy, spiritual growth, and beauty.  These photos will also display the tangles of ones soul through photographic art.
The documentary will  peep into the world of queens answering questions in regards to the history of locs, the different types of locs, life with locs, what does locs mean in different cultures, the stages of locs, locing methods, loc regimens, loc styles, and so so so much more. The documentary will also feature behind the scenes of photoshoots, bloopers, and nothing but positive energy across the board. This project is Loc beauty represented in many shades of brown, and will help empower, encourage, and educate loc queens around the world.

<p>The commemorative 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary Saturn V custom shaped USBs measure approximately 4.75 inches high and .75 inches in diameter.</p>
<p>The blank version contains 16GB of memory space.</p>
<p>The First Steps version is a 64GB drive with over 59GB of data – more than contained on 12DVDs – filled with over 5000 ultra-high resolution uncompressed JPEG images measuring up to 5000 pixels at 300dpi.  Each image has been completely and fully restored from the most recent and highest resolution NASA/JSC scans.</p>
<p><strong>The Apollospace Imaging Process</strong></p>
<p>Most of the raw public domain Apollo images (including all color images) used in creating the images found in this collection were acquired from Arizona State University (ASU), pursuant to an Agreement with NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC) for scanning NASA’s collection of Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo imagery in the highest resolutions ever made available.  Raw black and white images not yet available through ASU were acquired from the National Archives and/or NASA/JSC images sources.</p>
<p>Each image was lovingly and painstakingly corrected and enhanced as follows:</p>
<p>The borders of each image were cropped off and the images were then corrected for tone, color, and contrast.</p>
<p>One of the chief challenges in the raw scanned images is the lack of contrast, which results in the images having a ghostly fog.  Among the observations of space by the astronauts themselves is how inky black space is.  Thus, during processing, one of the main aims is to achieve as black a sky as possible without losing image details.</p>
<p>Because the images were shot at various exposures and lighting conditions, there is a wide contrast variation in original scanned images.  For aesthetic and other reasons, the images have been processed to reveal as much detail as possible.  For example, images of the lunar surface from orbit with the sun directly overhead are overexposed and, lacking shadows, the surface lacks detail and appears flat.  Such images have been processed to bring out the most detail possible, which generally results in them appearing much darker in comparison to other images but allows for better detail in crater rays.</p>
<p>The images are then blown up to their maximum resolution and cleaned of scratches, blemishes, dust, hair, scanning lines and other defects. It is not uncommon for a single image to require hundreds of corrective actions to clean the image of blemishes, faults, and defects. The end result are the cleanest images available anywhere, even at maximum resolution, without the distracting blemishes found in raw images and most corrected images available elsewhere.  As seen in some of the samples below, it is common for images to require as many as several hundred corrective actions to achieve the enhanced images available at Apollospace!</p>
<p>The images are further corrected and enhanced to provide clarity and consistency.   Levels and colors are balanced to make viewing the images, individually and as part of a slide show, as seamless and pleasing as possible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Here you can see numerous flaws in a tiny section from image AS09-20-3156:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559326619/ufnx8aatrnap9egiznla.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The<strong> <a href=""https://apollospace.com/about-us/imaging-process/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Apollospace image process</a></strong> page details the technical work of bringing these photographs to life.  But more than an historical record of one of the greatest accomplishments in human history, these images are art.   Each Apollo era photograph appearing on this site was taken by a human hand and with a human eye.  50 years later, each one has been restored, corrected, and enhanced with a human eye as well, to be as visually pleasing as they are historically and naturally accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Apollo Reflections</strong></p>
<p>If a picture is indeed worth a thousand words, then the story of Apollo, told through the nearly 20,000 photographs taken during the eleven manned Apollo missions between 1968 and 1972, would literally take tens of millions of words to tell.</p>
<p>The Apollo Program was, undoubtedly, one of the greatest accomplishments in human history.  Human beings, for the first time, left the Earth and gazed back at our beautiful planet, the source of all we have ever known, learning more not only about the wider universe, but also about ourselves and our own world. </p>
<p>Astronaut Fred Haise has called the image collection “incredible” and ""amazing.""</p>
<p>Others have commented: “they are without a doubt the highest quality image archive I have seen, and you need to be congratulated on the work and effort you have gone to!”</p>
<p>“Amazing quality images … I hope more people see the work you are doing it is truly amazing! It's a gold mine for those who know it!</p>
<p>This is THE DEFINITIVE collection of completely restored, ultra-high resolution photographs from the Apollo 7 through Apollo 11 missions – every photograph taken by the astronauts on these historic missions to land men on the moon and return them safely to Earth.  You cannot find these incredible photographs at this quality and resolution on-line or anywhere else.  In short, this is the best collection of these images available anywhere.</p>
<strong>Campaign Goals</strong><p>The mold and prototype of the “First Steps” Saturn V USB have been produced. This campaign has a goal of $10,000 to manufacture, package, and promote this incredible Apollo Photography archive, while gauging interest into how many we will look to produce for release in July, 2019 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11.</p>

The First Steps Saturn V USB contains 1409 ultra-high resolution flight images from the historic Apollo 11 Mission - every photograph taken by the astronauts during this historic mission.  All images contained on this USB are jpeg files with the least compression possible.  Color photo magazines (36N, 37R, 40S, and 44V) measure 5000 x 5000 pixels at 300 dpi. Black & white photo magazines (38O, 39Q, 41P, 42V, and 43T) measure 4000 x 4000 pixels at 300 dpi.

But this collection is more than the iconic images, it includes every photograph taken by the astronauts during these historic missions.
The over 5000 photographs in this definitive collection have each painstakingly been restored to the highest quality and resolution, painstakingly cleaned of dust, scanlines, scratches, hair and every other blemish (usually hundreds, and often thousands, of corrections per image!) down to the pixel level to create the highest quality highest resolution Apollo imagery ever made available.
Become a contributor today and get this amazing collection on a special commemorative custom Saturn five USB at 64 GB (60GB of actual data – that’s more than 12 DVDs) with over 5000 ultrahigh resolution photographs measuring up to 5000 pixels each. This collection is out of this world.
About the Saturn V USBs:

The commemorative 50th anniversary Saturn V custom shaped USBs measure approximately 4.75 inches high and .75 inches in diameter.
The blank version contains 16GB of memory space.
The First Steps version is a 64GB drive with over 59GB of data – more than contained on 12DVDs – filled with over 5000 ultra-high resolution uncompressed JPEG images measuring up to 5000 pixels at 300dpi.  Each image has been completely and fully restored from the most recent and highest resolution NASA/JSC scans.
The Apollospace Imaging Process
Most of the raw public domain Apollo images (including all color images) used in creating the images found in this collection were acquired from Arizona State University (ASU), pursuant to an Agreement with NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC) for scanning NASA’s collection of Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo imagery in the highest resolutions ever made available.  Raw black and white images not yet available through ASU were acquired from the National Archives and/or NASA/JSC images sources.
Each image was lovingly and painstakingly corrected and enhanced as follows:
The borders of each image were cropped off and the images were then corrected for tone, color, and contrast.
One of the chief challenges in the raw scanned images is the lack of contrast, which results in the images having a ghostly fog.  Among the observations of space by the astronauts themselves is how inky black space is.  Thus, during processing, one of the main aims is to achieve as black a sky as possible without losing image details.
Because the images were shot at various exposures and lighting conditions, there is a wide contrast variation in original scanned images.  For aesthetic and other reasons, the images have been processed to reveal as much detail as possible.  For example, images of the lunar surface from orbit with the sun directly overhead are overexposed and, lacking shadows, the surface lacks detail and appears flat.  Such images have been processed to bring out the most detail possible, which generally results in them appearing much darker in comparison to other images but allows for better detail in crater rays.
The images are then blown up to their maximum resolution and cleaned of scratches, blemishes, dust, hair, scanning lines and other defects. It is not uncommon for a single image to require hundreds of corrective actions to clean the image of blemishes, faults, and defects. The end result are the cleanest images available anywhere, even at maximum resolution, without the distracting blemishes found in raw images and most corrected images available elsewhere.  As seen in some of the samples below, it is common for images to require as many as several hundred corrective actions to achieve the enhanced images available at Apollospace!
The images are further corrected and enhanced to provide clarity and consistency.   Levels and colors are balanced to make viewing the images, individually and as part of a slide show, as seamless and pleasing as possible.

Below is the detailed final product after these blemishes have been removed.

And images that look like AS08-13-2299:

In short, literally hundreds of thousands of blemishes were removed from the over 5000 photos in this collection.






The Apollospace image process page details the technical work of bringing these photographs to life.  But more than an historical record of one of the greatest accomplishments in human history, these images are art.   Each Apollo era photograph appearing on this site was taken by a human hand and with a human eye.  50 years later, each one has been restored, corrected, and enhanced with a human eye as well, to be as visually pleasing as they are historically and naturally accurate.
Apollo Reflections
If a picture is indeed worth a thousand words, then the story of Apollo, told through the nearly 20,000 photographs taken during the eleven manned Apollo missions between 1968 and 1972, would literally take tens of millions of words to tell.
The Apollo Program was, undoubtedly, one of the greatest accomplishments in human history.  Human beings, for the first time, left the Earth and gazed back at our beautiful planet, the source of all we have ever known, learning more not only about the wider universe, but also about ourselves and our own world. 
Astronaut Fred Haise has called the image collection “incredible” and ""amazing.""
Others have commented: “they are without a doubt the highest quality image archive I have seen, and you need to be congratulated on the work and effort you have gone to!”
“Amazing quality images … I hope more people see the work you are doing it is truly amazing! It's a gold mine for those who know it!
This is THE DEFINITIVE collection of completely restored, ultra-high resolution photographs from the Apollo 7 through Apollo 11 missions – every photograph taken by the astronauts on these historic missions to land men on the moon and return them safely to Earth.  You cannot find these incredible photographs at this quality and resolution on-line or anywhere else.  In short, this is the best collection of these images available anywhere.
Campaign GoalsThe mold and prototype of the “First Steps” Saturn V USB have been produced. This campaign has a goal of $10,000 to manufacture, package, and promote this incredible Apollo Photography archive, while gauging interest into how many we will look to produce for release in July, 2019 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11.

Съемка всегда была для меня мистическим процессом, частью необходимой мне духовной практики общения с пространством. Пленка этому весьма соответствует, не позволяя сразу видеть результат, но донося его до нас почти напрямую - через двойное прикосновение света. У пленки есть интересные творческие возможности - крупное зерно и различные эффекты, получаемые при съемке с помощью комбинаций мультиэкспозиции, зуммирования и шевеленки.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543151324/bpvpsuntirjomlbu8tpt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543151377/xwsk2vhzgnstj3epeb4m.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543194644/acvbzfy2675c2asrg4ja.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543194708/zfsdaqmoew0svy2xotn0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>В моей фотографии никогда не было коммерческой составляющей, я не занимался продвижением и организовал только одну персональную выставку (в 2011). Тем не менее, материал постепенно накапливался, складывался в законченные проекты и требовал выхода к людям. Для наглядного представления проектов я выбрал расположение всех фотографий единым блоком, чтобы можно было составить общее представление. Но, расположенные рядом, фотографии иначе воспринимаются нашим мозгом, начиная ""влиять"" друг на друга. И надо прилагать множество усилий, чтобы они не превращались в бессмысленный визуальный хаос. Еще сложнее добиться, чтобы взаимодействие изображений в нашем сознании приводило к рождению новых ощущений и смыслов. Я изучал эти вопросы около двух лет и пришел к концепции фотосплетений - художественной формы, в которой отдельные изображения объединяются в единое высказывание за счет визуальных и смысловых связей.<br/>Идеальное фотосплетение - это сгусток энергии, посылаемый вам мирозданием руками автора. Чтобы принять эту передачу, надо дать своему взгляду время прогуляться в сплетении изображений. Лучше всего на мониторе компьютера - на маленьком экране связи значительно ослабнут. Тогда фотографии, перекликаясь между собой, сами подскажут путь вашему вниманию. И, возможно, проявится общая драматургия работы.<br/>На нынешний момент я завершил шесть сплетений, фотографии для которых снимались по несколько лет, а сами они заплетались по много месяцев.</p><p>Первое фотосплетение называется ""Вглядываясь в иное"". Фотографии были сняты с 2005 по 2011 годы в Санкт-Петербурге и ближайших окрестностях. Я полностью перестроил это сплетение совсем недавно, поэтому структурно оно самое сложное из шести.

Это грандиозное собрание миллионов паломников со всей Индии, на котором в полной мере проявляется торжество и сияние индийского йогического духа. В месте слияния священных рек Ганги и Ямуны строится гигантский палаточный город, и проводится одно из крупнейших собраний людей на Земле. В 2013 году за два месяца Кумбха Мелу посетило около 120 миллионов человек, как бы невероятно это ни звучало. Но, несмотря на непостижимую концентрацию людей, фестиваль наполнен удивительной, доброжелательной и мистической атмосферой, ведь сюда приезжают с самыми чистыми стремлениями.<br/>В своем проекте я попытаюсь передать какую-то часть энергии этого живого чуда. И для этого я обращаюсь к вам за поддержкой. Примерная сумма, которая мне потребуется, составляет 1500$, но и в случае меньших сборов я буду прилагать все усилия, чтобы попасть на Кумбха Мелу и реализовать проект.<br/>Благодарностью за вашу помощь станут мои фотографии с подписью (любая из 147 представленных на сайте, выбранного вами размера), фотосплетения на бумаге и открытки из Варанаси.

Photography has always been a mystical process for me, being a part of the spiritual practice of my communication with space. The film is very consistent with this, not allowing you to immediately see the result, but almost directly bringing it to us through a double touch of light. The film has interesting creative possibilities - large grain and various effects obtained when multiple exposure, zooming and shaking.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543280838/dj4fvdrnwm0xwkaqogob.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543281569/fskk1tmsscmtuap8fsxi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543281372/euybxe0nz2bkb48kpv4m.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543281392/df7fg4gtyqdjyjgfxv7m.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>There was never a commercial component in my photo, I was not engaged in promotion and I organized only one individual exhibition of my photography (in the year of 2011). Nevertheless, the material gradually accumulated, evolved into finished projects and demanded access to people. For a visual representation of the projects, I decided to locate all the photos in a single block so that you can get a general idea. But when located nearby, the photographs are perceived differently by our brain, starting to ""influence"" each other. And we must make a lot of effort so that they do not turn into meaningless visual chaos. It is even more difficult to ensure that the interaction of images in our consciousness leads to the birth of new sensations and meanings. I studied these questions for about two years and came to the concept of photoplexuses - an art form in which individual images are combined into a single statement due to visual and semantic links.<br/>The ideal photoplexus is a clot of energy sent to you by the universe through the author. To accept this transmission, you need to give your look some time to stroll through the plexus of images. The best way to do it is by using a computer monitor - viewed on a small screen the connections will be significantly weakened. Then the photos, matching each other, will give you their own hints on how to perceive them. And, perhaps, the overall drama of the work will become apparent.<br/>Thus far, I have completed six plexuses, photographs for which have been taken for several years, and they themselves have been getting intertwined for many months.</p><p>The first photoplexus is called ""Peering into the other."" The photos were taken in the years of 2005 to 2011 in St. Petersburg and the surrounding areas. I have completely rebuilt this plexus quite recently, so structurally it is the most difficult one of the six plexuses.

Gratitude will be: postcards from Varanasi, photos from six projects, photoplexuses.[english description of the campaign, see below]---Друзья!Много лет я снимаю на черно-белую пленку, стремясь передать красоту и божественность естества, как сам их вижу. Съемка всегда была для меня мистическим процессом, частью необходимой мне духовной практики общения с пространством. Пленка этому весьма соответствует, не позволяя сразу видеть результат, но донося его до нас почти напрямую - через двойное прикосновение света. У пленки есть интересные творческие возможности - крупное зерно и различные эффекты, получаемые при съемке с помощью комбинаций мультиэкспозиции, зуммирования и шевеленки. В моей фотографии никогда не было коммерческой составляющей, я не занимался продвижением и организовал только одну персональную выставку (в 2011). Тем не менее, материал постепенно накапливался, складывался в законченные проекты и требовал выхода к людям. Для наглядного представления проектов я выбрал расположение всех фотографий единым блоком, чтобы можно было составить общее представление. Но, расположенные рядом, фотографии иначе воспринимаются нашим мозгом, начиная ""влиять"" друг на друга. И надо прилагать множество усилий, чтобы они не превращались в бессмысленный визуальный хаос. Еще сложнее добиться, чтобы взаимодействие изображений в нашем сознании приводило к рождению новых ощущений и смыслов. Я изучал эти вопросы около двух лет и пришел к концепции фотосплетений - художественной формы, в которой отдельные изображения объединяются в единое высказывание за счет визуальных и смысловых связей.Идеальное фотосплетение - это сгусток энергии, посылаемый вам мирозданием руками автора. Чтобы принять эту передачу, надо дать своему взгляду время прогуляться в сплетении изображений. Лучше всего на мониторе компьютера - на маленьком экране связи значительно ослабнут. Тогда фотографии, перекликаясь между собой, сами подскажут путь вашему вниманию. И, возможно, проявится общая драматургия работы.На нынешний момент я завершил шесть сплетений, фотографии для которых снимались по несколько лет, а сами они заплетались по много месяцев.Первое фотосплетение называется ""Вглядываясь в иное"". Фотографии были сняты с 2005 по 2011 годы в Санкт-Петербурге и ближайших окрестностях. Я полностью перестроил это сплетение совсем недавно, поэтому структурно оно самое сложное из шести. Посмотреть в высоком разрешении его можно на моем сайте - http://www.lukinskiy.com/ru/peering_into_the_ot... Фотографии следующего проекта - ""Притяжение границы"" - сняты с 2004 по 2011 годы, преимущественно, на кладбищах Санкт-Петербурга. Специальные эффекты, которые есть на части фотографий, получены в момент съемки на пленку. В высоком разрешении на сайте -  http://www.lukinskiy.com/ru/attraction_of_the_b... Фотографии сплетения ""Равновесие пространства"" сняты с 2005 по 2016 годы в Санкт-Петербурге и ближайших окрестностях. В высоком разрешении на сайте -  http://www.lukinskiy.com/ru/balance_of_space/ Фотографии, составившие сплетение ""Медитация на Стиксе"", снимались в брошенных и умирающих деревнях на востоке Новгородской области (400 км. от Петербурга) с 2009 по 2012 годы. В высоком разрешении на сайте -  http://www.lukinskiy.com/ru/meditation_on_the_s... Там же снимался портретный проект ""Чистые люди"" (с 2005 по 2012 годы). В высоком разрешении на сайте -  http://www.lukinskiy.com/ru/pure_people/ Проект ""Свет Kashi"" снимался в Индии в священном городе Варанаси в 2014 году. В высоком разрешении на сайте -  http://www.lukinskiy.com/ru/light_of_Kashi/ По материалам этого проекта я сделал серию открыток ""Свет Kashi"" из 13 штук общим тиражом в 2000 экземпляров (на данный момент у меня осталась примерно половина). Чтобы придать открыткам ценность артефакта, я напечатал их там же, где снимал - в древнем Варанаси. И разместил на оборотной строне надпись ""Printed in Varanasi 2017"". Все открытки можно посмотреть на сайте - http://www.lukinskiy.com/ru/postcards/ Цели кампании и вознаграждения.Новое, седьмое по счету, фотосплетение я собираюсь посвятить величайшему индийскому религиозному празднику - Кумбха Меле, который пройдет в городе Аллахабаде с середины января по начало марта 2019 года. Это грандиозное собрание миллионов паломников со всей Индии, на котором в полной мере проявляется торжество и сияние индийского йогического духа. В месте слияния священных рек Ганги и Ямуны строится гигантский палаточный город, и проводится одно из крупнейших собраний людей на Земле. В 2013 году за два месяца Кумбха Мелу посетило около 120 миллионов человек, как бы невероятно это ни звучало. Но, несмотря на непостижимую концентрацию людей, фестиваль наполнен удивительной, доброжелательной и мистической атмосферой, ведь сюда приезжают с самыми чистыми стремлениями.В своем проекте я попытаюсь передать какую-то часть энергии этого живого чуда. И для этого я обращаюсь к вам за поддержкой. Примерная сумма, которая мне потребуется, составляет 1500$, но и в случае меньших сборов я буду прилагать все усилия, чтобы попасть на Кумбха Мелу и реализовать проект.Благодарностью за вашу помощь станут мои фотографии с подписью (любая из 147 представленных на сайте, выбранного вами размера), фотосплетения на бумаге и открытки из Варанаси. Примеры вознаграждений представлены на фотографии ниже. Как поддержать проект, я подробно описал здесь - https://lukinskiy.livejournal.com/253873.html. Кроме сбора средств у этой кампании есть еще две цели. В ее ходе я впервые представляю фотосплетения на суд зрителей, чтобы проверить эту концепцию на практике, и с благодарностью жду ваших отзывов и соображений. И, разумеется, для моей дальнейшей работы крайне важен поиск заинтересованных галерей и других культурных институций. Поэтому, кроме денежных вкладов, будет особенно полезна любая ваша информационная помощь. Вы можете посетить мой сайт (www.lukinskiy.com), подписаться на аккаунт в facebook (www.facebook.com/evlukinskiy) или instagram (www.instagram.com/lukinskiy_). И, если что-то из моего творчества окажется вам близко, пожалуйста, поделитесь информацией о кампании.Большое вам спасибо за интерес и внимание, всего хорошего и удачи!---Friends!For many years I have been shooting on black and white film, trying to convey the beauty and the divinity of being, as I see them. Photography has always been a mystical process for me, being a part of the spiritual practice of my communication with space. The film is very consistent with this, not allowing you to immediately see the result, but almost directly bringing it to us through a double touch of light. The film has interesting creative possibilities - large grain and various effects obtained when multiple exposure, zooming and shaking. There was never a commercial component in my photo, I was not engaged in promotion and I organized only one individual exhibition of my photography (in the year of 2011). Nevertheless, the material gradually accumulated, evolved into finished projects and demanded access to people. For a visual representation of the projects, I decided to locate all the photos in a single block so that you can get a general idea. But when located nearby, the photographs are perceived differently by our brain, starting to ""influence"" each other. And we must make a lot of effort so that they do not turn into meaningless visual chaos. It is even more difficult to ensure that the interaction of images in our consciousness leads to the birth of new sensations and meanings. I studied these questions for about two years and came to the concept of photoplexuses - an art form in which individual images are combined into a single statement due to visual and semantic links.The ideal photoplexus is a clot of energy sent to you by the universe through the author. To accept this transmission, you need to give your look some time to stroll through the plexus of images. The best way to do it is by using a computer monitor - viewed on a small screen the connections will be significantly weakened. Then the photos, matching each other, will give you their own hints on how to perceive them. And, perhaps, the overall drama of the work will become apparent.Thus far, I have completed six plexuses, photographs for which have been taken for several years, and they themselves have been getting intertwined for many months.The first photoplexus is called ""Peering into the other."" The photos were taken in the years of 2005 to 2011 in St. Petersburg and the surrounding areas. I have completely rebuilt this plexus quite recently, so structurally it is the most difficult one of the six plexuses. In high resolution you can view it on my website - http://www.lukinskiy.com/en/peering_into_the_ot... Photos of the next project - ""Attraction of the border"" - were taken in the years of 2004 to 2011, mainly in the cemeteries of St. Petersburg. Special effects that can be seen on some of these photos were obtained at the moment of shooting on film. In high resolution - http://www.lukinskiy.com/en/attraction_of_the_b... Photos of the plexus ""Balance of space"" were taken in the years of 2005 to 2016 in St. Petersburg and its immediate vicinity. In high resolution - http://www.lukinskiy.com/en/balance_of_space/The photos that made up the plexus ""Meditation on the Styx"" were taken in some abandoned and dying villages in the east of the Novgorod region (400 km from St. Petersburg) in the years of 2009 to 2012. In high resolution - http://www.lukinskiy.com/en/meditation_on_the_s... The portrait project ""Pure people"" was also filmed there (2005 to 2012).

In high resolution - http://www.lukinskiy.com/en/light_of_Kashi/ Based on the materials of this project, I made a series of postcards called ""Light of Kashi "" consisting of of 13 pieces with a total circulation of 2000 copies (at the moment I have about a half left). To give postcards the value of the artifact, I printed them in the same place where they were taken - in the ancient city of Varanasi.

<h2>The project:</h2>
<h3>I am viable.</h3>
<p>2020 has been a year of great reflection – it also marks my tenth year as a professional photographer in the industry. To mark the anniversary, I’ve created a one-of-a-kind coffee table book featuring some of the greatest images from throughout my theatre journey so far. The book, split across 120+ pages, includes production imagery, personal portraits, and images that capture a moment in our joint theatrical history. I’m so excited to share my work in print with you, and celebrate an industry like no other.</p>
<h3>What it will cost and what you'll get:</h3>
</div><div>
<p>To make this project a reality and look as stunning as the images deserve to be, it will cost approximately £15,000. This figure includes the printing of the first 400 books, any design work, marketing, press, retouching, my cups of coffee, and going though nearly one million images from quite literally thousands of shoots.</p>
<p>It’s going to take a while to get everything ready for you as we move towards our hopeful launch of July 2021. And if we can get this finished earlier, we sure will. </p>
<h3>But why?</h3>
<p>I’ve spent ten years doing what I love. I do it for others to invite audiences into their theatre; photos also often help celebrate an individual. It’s also sometimes just for fun! </p>
<p>I want to document this journey together in print so other people can enjoy the photos as they should be seen – in print and there in the flesh.</p>
<h3>And one more thing</h3>
<p>25% of all the profits (so after taxes and costs) will go to MAD TRUST, a charity I have supported for over five years through West End Bares and West End Eurovision.</p>
<h3>Just one more thing, honest</h3>
<p>Thank you for supporting me over the last ten years, it was a leap of faith starting a career in the arts in 2010, and even though 2020 has been unkind to so many of us, we will be back and creating work for you all again very soon!</p>

<p>We are a group of enthusiasts interested in
skydiving, photography,  traveling and exploring, gathered in Airclub
Cumulus - Opatija - Croatia.</p>
<p>Our campaign aims to connect  beauty of
landscapes with skydiving trough artistic photography and bring it closer to
people around the world who do not have the opportunity to see the world from
skydivers perspective.</p>
<p>Our
wish and goal is to take loads of attractive photographs of our activities on
beautiful landscapes of Croatia, to organize and coordinate group of 30
skydivers which will perform those jumps on 20 locations and to have lots of
fun along the way. Please, help us to achieve that :)</p>
<p>We have a lot of experience organizing  this sort of events. We started in 2009 when
we first organized Skydive Photo Contest 
on island Lošinj. Given it was a big success we decided to repeat it and
we have been organizing it since. Later on we decided to try other locations
such as Opatija and Ičići as well.. This year we would like to spread this
project on many other locations, and that is why we need a bit more
subventions.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430807015/nxvsuafyt0ap0azcl2tq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>What We Need &amp;
What You Get</h3>
<p>We need 30 USD to cover expenses for one 'jump
ticket' (airplane, fuel and airport charges). Our goal is to cover group of 30
skydivers to perform 2 jumps at each of 20 locations, (Vrsar, Medulin, Unije,
Lošinj, Krk, Rab, Pag, Zadar, Hvar, Brač, Vis, Dubrovnik, Nikšić, Sinj, Otočac, Bihać, Zagreb, Varaždin, Osijek and
Borovo airfields).</p>
<p>Through simple calculation (33,75 USD x 30 skydivers x
2 jumps x 20 locations) we get required budget of 40.500 USD</p>
<p>For your donations we are happy to offer you rights
for using our aerial landscape photography. We can  jump with some special messages for your

<p>We are skydivers, and we know a lot about the risk.
Also, we know a lot about reducing the risk and our goal is to have fun and be

involved in organizing the project. Its job is to resolve and eliminate
possible issues and risks and give us permissions for air activities.</p>
<p>Our only challenge are finances, because Skydive
Photo Contest tour which we want to organize on 20 locations requires enough
financial capabilities to cover airplane, fuel and airport expenses. All other
expenses will be covered by skydivers themselves.</p>

We are a group of enthusiasts interested in
skydiving, photography,  traveling and exploring, gathered in Airclub
Cumulus - Opatija - Croatia.
Our campaign aims to connect  beauty of
landscapes with skydiving trough artistic photography and bring it closer to
people around the world who do not have the opportunity to see the world from
skydivers perspective.
Our
wish and goal is to take loads of attractive photographs of our activities on
beautiful landscapes of Croatia, to organize and coordinate group of 30
skydivers which will perform those jumps on 20 locations and to have lots of
fun along the way. Please, help us to achieve that :)
We have a lot of experience organizing  this sort of events. We started in 2009 when
we first organized Skydive Photo Contest 
on island Lošinj. Given it was a big success we decided to repeat it and
we have been organizing it since. Later on we decided to try other locations
such as Opatija and Ičići as well.. This year we would like to spread this
project on many other locations, and that is why we need a bit more
subventions.What We Need &
What You Get
We need 30 USD to cover expenses for one 'jump
ticket' (airplane, fuel and airport charges). Our goal is to cover group of 30
skydivers to perform 2 jumps at each of 20 locations, (Vrsar, Medulin, Unije,
Lošinj, Krk, Rab, Pag, Zadar, Hvar, Brač, Vis, Dubrovnik, Nikšić, Sinj, Otočac, Bihać, Zagreb, Varaždin, Osijek and
Borovo airfields).
Through simple calculation (33,75 USD x 30 skydivers x
2 jumps x 20 locations) we get required budget of 40.500 USD
For your donations we are happy to offer you rights
for using our aerial landscape photography. We can  jump with some special messages for your
friends, fans or customers on our clothes or we can put your stickers on our
airplane during  this project as well.
Unfortunately, we can not offer you to jump with us
because this kind of perk is not allowed, but if you are qualified skydiver,
you can become one of our team member.The Impact
This project is important and
beneficial to many because it will help:

young skydivers to increase the skills and gain experience
spread information about tourist locations which are not yet
disocvered by many people, yet very beautiful
photographs taken will be keept as historical document

Your support will enable us to reduce the price of
skydiving jumps and thereby increase the number of jumps. Also, we will get the
opportunity to perform more jumps on several beautiful locations, and of course
that will allow us to take more beautiful photographs.Risks &

on another where we have enough
Should there be some technical problem occurred with the airplane,
we have option to rent other airplane.

If we don't reach planned funds, we will reduce
number of skydivers, or number of jumps, or reduce some of the locations.
If

These children suffer mockery, racism, discrimination, and self-identity issues. Labeled often incorrectly - as ""half dollar"", ""souvenir babies"" - many live in poverty and stigma in an ultra-conservative Catholic society. Yet, to this day, both governments have largely ignored their pleas for help. Moved by their heart-wrenching stories and frustrated by their political invisibility, Enrico Dungca is compelled to document the faces and stories of these Amerasians, in the hope that more people around the world will learn of their struggle.What We Need & What You GetThe funds raised will go to the book production, printing, editing, and design costs.

The Phillips family owns and manages several large ranches in Colorado and New Mexico and have been ranching for five generations. They practice traditional ranching methods while embracing some modern methods that stress conservation and responsible grazing management to preserve the local ecosystem. With current food demands and globalization, the Phillips family's lifestyle and culture are slowly vanishing, replaced by big box cattle production. This culture is an integral part of the American identity. Over the two year period, I am following the Phillips family during their day-to-day routines.

Due to population growth and the increased need for food in America and around the world, traditional ranches are being replaced by warehouse-style cattle yards. The traditional ranching lifestyle is slowly disappearing and will likely change dramatically over the next few decades. <strong><i>This documentary photo book aims to preserve a part of our nation's history and </i><i>chronicle</i><i> how Ranchlands applies modern, science-based management methods and ambitious conservation programs to encourage </i><i>large-scale</i><i> preservation and restoration of our natural resources.</i></strong></p><h3>Fundraising Goals</h3><ul>

<h3>About Forgiving Home</h3>
<p>This is about my experience of forgiving where I grew up.  It's not my parents fault that I particularly dislike the place.  I had an unbelievable childhood.  It was my teenage years that made me want to get away so badly.</p>
<p>At 13, I lost my grandfather.  It wasn't unexpected.  He was in his early 90's, had fallen and broken his hip a year earlier, and basically, he never came home.  He lived in a nursing home for the remainder of his life.  I hated that place.  I really regret not spending more time with him in the remainder of his life, but the place he lived, it smelled like death.  It was death.  A day after his passing, I got my period for the first time.</p>
<p>My grandmother was destroyed by his death.  Ended up having a heart attack a few months after his passing from a syndrome called ""the broken heart syndrome"".  Go figure.  She recovered but was definitely not the same.  Over the next two years, she practically mourned herself to death and on April 17th, my father found her on the floor.  We figure it was another heart attack.  I was at a sleepover the night before.  One of my friends at the sleepover found out about her death before I did, over a text.  So I found out about my grandma... over a text message.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523139216/x8iba8vdqmmfiwsvxklm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>EXACTLY a week after my grandmother's death, an f-4 tornado hit my town.  I am grateful to be alive.  A tree fell on my room but luckily did not go through the whole house.  20 other trees fell like dominos around our home, but only one fell on our house... on my room.  My neighbor and two of my classmates were killed.  That day was the first time I ever wished I was dead.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Mental health is a stigma, especially in the United States, but is still a huge problem that seems to be pushed under the table.  Via the National Alliance on Mental Illness, 20% of youth ages 13-18 live with a mental health condition.  Suicide is the third leading cause of death in youth ages 10-24  (10th leading cause of death nationwide) and 90% of those who died by suicide had an underlying mental illness.  50% of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin by age 14.  Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide.  Our adolescence is some of the hardest times in our lives and for some people, like myself, it was the worst.  I want my exhibition to be a place for others to share their own stories and for youth who come to see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, it does get better, and that this isn't the end of your life it is only the beginning.  I do not wish what I went through on my worst enemy but I want to take my experiences and turn them into something meaningful and helpful for others.  Forgiving Home will do just that.</p>

</div></div>","About Forgiving Home
This is about my experience of forgiving where I grew up.  It's not my parents fault that I particularly dislike the place.  I had an unbelievable childhood.  It was my teenage years that made me want to get away so badly.
At 13, I lost my grandfather.  It wasn't unexpected.  He was in his early 90's, had fallen and broken his hip a year earlier, and basically, he never came home.  He lived in a nursing home for the remainder of his life.  I hated that place.  I really regret not spending more time with him in the remainder of his life, but the place he lived, it smelled like death.  It was death.  A day after his passing, I got my period for the first time.
My grandmother was destroyed by his death.  Ended up having a heart attack a few months after his passing from a syndrome called ""the broken heart syndrome"".  Go figure.  She recovered but was definitely not the same.  Over the next two years, she practically mourned herself to death and on April 17th, my father found her on the floor.  We figure it was another heart attack.  I was at a sleepover the night before.  One of my friends at the sleepover found out about her death before I did, over a text.  So I found out about my grandma... over a text message.  

EXACTLY a week after my grandmother's death, an f-4 tornado hit my town.  I am grateful to be alive.  A tree fell on my room but luckily did not go through the whole house.  20 other trees fell like dominos around our home, but only one fell on our house... on my room.  My neighbor and two of my classmates were killed.  That day was the first time I ever wished I was dead.
Life was a rollercoaster after that.  I went to counseling but, it only taught me how to not talk.  My doctor put me on prozac.  I went from 10mg to 40mg, a full adult dosage, at 15. 

High school was awful.  I wish I liked it.  I wish my good memories were more vivid then the bad memories.  But they aren't, my good memories are hazy; my bad memories are so vivid, like they happened yesterday.  A boy I stupidly thought I was going to marry, broke up with me over a text message, in the middle of my school day.  A girl I thought was one of my closest friends turned on me during a severe mental breakdown, and honestly, I don't blame her.  I was screwed up.  My senior year of high school I remember thinking if I was brave enough, I would jump out the window and hopefully die.  I ended up telling my mother I felt this way (thank God), and the next day I was at the doctors again who finally sent me to a psychiatrist.  I went from Prozac to Celexa which thank God, that medication worked.  I decided to not compete with my high school dance team my senior year because it only made my depression worsen.  Girls are awful.  Their parents are worse.  I still can't believe some of the things those parents said about me, a 17 year old girl, over 30 years younger than they were.  I could care less what those girls said about me, and probably still say about me, it's their parents that hurt me more.  I am so thankful that I had the dance studio, where I had danced since I was 3, to help me fall in love with dance and life again.

<h3>What is A Wonderland of Sins?</h3>
<p>""Wonderland is a heterotopia, in which we explore things we don't have space to go into in our daily lives. Concepts of fun and temptation can be difficult, even seeming 'other'  and detached from the lives we try to live.""</p>
<p>Hello! My name is Charlie Granby and I am a freelance photographer and filmmaker from Liverpool, U.K. I need your help... </p>
<p>A Wonderland of Sins is a passion project of mine that has been in the works over recent months in order to bring together a diverse group of individuals to create art that I hope will contribute to the ever growing movement towards acceptance and understanding within the human race. </p>
<p>It is a crossover of Alice in Wonderland and the 7 Deadly Sins. My reasoning for combining these two themes is because ultimately, I feel they complement each other well. The wacky, nonsensical nature of Wonderland combined with the shocking and somewhat disturbing nature of the 7 Deadly Sins, leads to a match that just makes sense to me. It's weird, it's quirky, and it's going to be hugely interesting to see how people respond.</p>
<p>But why is this important Charlie? Well, let me tell you!</p>
<p>In a world where people are encouraged to be lighter- both in skin tone and in weight, retouched images with stretch marks, spots and fat ironed out, mental health crisis and a skyrocket in eating disorders, body dysmorphia, racial hate crime; this project is breaking the taboo of everything. Society has used the Seven Deadly Sins against minorities to push them down, and this shoot aims to break that narrative. It's a big middle finger to all of it. What we should and shouldn't be, what we should and shouldn't do. None of the work will be photoshopped, you will see the raw beauty that these people possess.  It's about time we started emphasising inclusivity and diversity on multiple fronts. Skin colour, body shape and size, this project is encouraging everything and anything. We don't see that concept reflected as much in the media and in the arts- now is the time for change. </p>
<p>If we can get this project into the studio and then out into the world, it would be such a huge achievement and it would make a difference. I want people to see this work and for it to be a very normal thing to have people of all races, sizes and genders/non binary in a group together. Let's break it down and make inclusivity part of every day life.</p>
<p>Government funding for the arts increasingly difficult to get. Unless you live in London, it's virtually impossible to get the funding you need, especially for women. The reality is, crowdfunding is our only viable option right now.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>SO... we need to raise quite a lot of money, (just shy of £3000 eek!) This is to cover:</p>
<p>- Payment of models</p>
<p>- Payment of crew</p>
<p>- Food for the day</p>
<p>- Costume/Set design</p>
<p>- Equipment and production costs of the finished works</p>
<p>- Exhibition costs- venue hire, staffing, equipment</p>
<p>My team and I have come up with some exciting perks for those who claim one on donation. I personally am super excited by these, and I hope you will be too!</p>
<p>If we don't raise the full amount, then the money will be split as best possible so that we can try to get as much as we can out of it. Basically, I'm going to stop at nothing to make this project work!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What your contribution means is that I, with the help of my amazing team, can bring to life an important and needed campaign to help shape the views in society towards race and body positivity. </p>
<p>Additionally, I am planning a terribly exciting exhibition that will feature the work along with a panel discussion, live music and spoken word poetry. It's going to be an opportunity for important conversation around the whole theme of the shoot, so that new ideas can emerge and a foot can be put forward to mark the way of change. </p>
<p>I am really excited by this project. I believe in this project, and I am so lucky to have the support from an incredible group of models and crew who have come aboard to make this work. My previous crowdfunds for projects such as my Curzon Soho/Crossrail film and Constellations, a stop-motion animation film which is in production, have both been a success- I want to make it a hatrick and bring this project to life!</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If right now you aren't in a position to donate money, that is completely A-okay. What I ask however is that you help me spread the word- share this campaign, talk about it to your friends- let's get A Wonderland of Sins on people's map!</p>
<p>Any and all support is so appreciated and I am just so grateful to every person who tries to help. Honestly it means the world.</p>
</div><p>With all that being said, thank you so much for taking the time to be here on this page!</p><p>Be bold, be the change.</p></div>","What is A Wonderland of Sins?

<p>Since returning to photography in 2012, it has been a true rollercoaster of well, all of it. I have made a lot of wonderful new friends from all over and all walks of life, my work has found itself in the homes of people around the world, and of course other amazing opportunities and friendships that have come along with it. </p>
<p>The road that has paved it all is by far not easy. Needless to say however, I am the worst sales person that I know of, which maybe, this is probably may be the best or worst idea I have come up with. </p>
<p>The big secret is, my wonderful brother has been the biggest backer to what I have been doing. In 2012, he had noticed that I was getting [back] into photography and he saw the passion I had for it and how good I was getting. He had gifted (and mostly loaned) me some of his equipment (as he is a hobbyist) and I have been using it (putting it lightly) ever since. The time has come that I return his equipment to him, which includes one camera body and most of the lenses. </p>
<p>Most of the world knows that photography (mostly of the entertainment field) does not pay well, if at all, and that most of my income has come from smaller jobs but most of all, from sales of my photography* (which of what is legally allowed). So, I am doing this little thing, which is in time for my birthday (9/19) to where I could persuade your heart to help me continue this path all of you have helped me get to. </p>

<ul>
<li>I am a visual artist among other things. My work lies somewhere between fine art and dark art. Considering most of my concepts, I prefer the term Dark Art. While most of my background is based in traditional art techniques, I have shifted to the digital age for my most recent imagery.

</div></div>","The Void Series
The Void Series is comprised of two photography books full of dark inspiration. Check out what's inside and click on the individual perks to learn more about them!Where do we go from here? Where we see darkness, there is a truth to be found in order to bring us somewhere beautiful.Book I:Into the Void: Into the Void: This is a book of mysterious and dark-yet-ethereal landscapes. It Includes a few tasteful artistic nudes.""Introducing the nude to the landscape adds a sense of human vulnerability that isn't always there without the human figure. Being stripped of our self-built identity, our comfort, stripped from being placed in any particular time. Timeless. Connected to the Earth. ""
 
 
Book II: 
The Call of the Void:  This book is more on the macabre side of things, although both books reflect the concept of inner-darkness.This is a book of portraits that conceals the identity of the individuals photographed. The purpose is to take something ordinary and shift it into something that tells a new story on a different level.

I am guaranteeing that all final orders arrive to you by September of 2020, if not sooner! I am willing to take down payments from those who can't afford a book right now to reserve one for later. $40 now and the rest when you can!  Please see the Reservations Tier!

Who am I?
The artist behind the shadows!

I am a visual artist among other things. My work lies somewhere between fine art and dark art. Considering most of my concepts, I prefer the term Dark Art. While most of my background is based in traditional art techniques, I have shifted to the digital age for my most recent imagery. By using a combination of body painting, digital photography, and digital art I am creating surreal, dream-like worlds.
I combine elements of life and death to create cohesive yet contrasting imagery. These images draw the viewer to question the story behind them and their dark but pleasant nature. Read more about my thoughts in the books!
My landscape photos have been compared to the style of photography known as near Infrared, initially produced by kodak aerochrome film.
These books include images from over the past four years. I am very dedicated to this project!
I am raising funds to make my first ever Dark Fine Art Photography book series.  I will be making two versions, a book of dark landscapes and one of the dark portraits. This will include a collection of images from 2016-2019.

What I Need & What You Get
Money for producing books! Books and Prints! Signed Prints, galore!

The purpose of reaching this goal is to make the books more affordable. If I do reach the goal, everyone who ordered a book gets a free gift! (it's a secret)

<p>Hi! I’m Chris. Originally from Georgia, I spent most of my post-high school years living in parts of the US before settling in Canada for five years to study culture, visual communication, and artistic photography. I then decided to take an opportunity to move to Japan—something I've wanted to do for years—to explore this rich culture.</p>
<p>Since moving to Japan just this year, I’ve found myself living in and visiting more remote, lesser-known areas, and I felt the urge to start photographing these places and experiences. My career then slowly began with very minimal investment, and I now specialize in nature, lifestyle, and event photography. My education in artistic photography and visual communication led me to understand elements of photography and how they communicate different emotions and messages. I use what I've learned to capture the unique qualities of places, people, and events, preferring a style that speaks to deeper emotions rather than fleeting trends in digital photography.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>While so far my photography career has involved only commercial work, I've also spent the year capturing and selecting several artistic series based on more unknown parts of Japan—away from over-saturated cities and popular tourist spots and deeper into hidden communities and forgotten places. I have a plan for 2019 to not only raise the quality of my commercial work, but also begin producing these series and offering high-quality prints online, at markets, and in galleries. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>  For more than 45 years I have been creating photographic art--singing a song with images and words.  I primarily shoot film and have a particular fondness for black and white film.  I’ve been called a motion and emotion photographer, specializing in performing arts, working with numerous professional theater and dance companies.  What I share is a passionate observation of my life, my times as a metaphor of humanity in these troubled times. What I have to show is a way of seeing, a way of life.  Since the 70's I have created images of people, musicians, dancers, poets, laborers, revolutionaries, artists.</b></span><br/></p>

<p><b>The common man as an artist, life as creatively experienced not just existing.  I’ve photographed rock festivals, the Vietnam War, encounters with Abby Hoffman, and Gloria Steinem, just to name a few. I consider my images to be taken by a compassionate observer of the human condition.  </b></p>
<p><b>I seek to share my vision of humanity, through a journal of images and words, impressions on a life of photographic art. Poems, essays, tales real and surreal.  I wish to share a life in moments--from the wisdom of age returning to the freedom of  a child.</b></p>
<p><b>Contributors will help me with day to day and publishing expenses for this book.  I see this work as a lifelong self-portrait—told through poems, essays, and of course photographs.                                 Peter J. Crowley</b></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>This campaign will be an ongoing process.  The initial funding will be used to catalog my career's work, over 200,000 negatives and 400 pages of written copy.  To catalog these requires a lot of help, and I  would love to start paying my intern.  As great gratitude for you contribution,  you will receive a poster of my original photos from gallery shows (poster created by SL Johnson Images).  I am also offering prints of my words and images married together, a poem and photograph capturing the same emotion, telling a story.</b></p>

</div></div>","Summary
  For more than 45 years I have been creating photographic art--singing a song with images and words.  I primarily shoot film and have a particular fondness for black and white film.  I’ve been called a motion and emotion photographer, specializing in performing arts, working with numerous professional theater and dance companies.  What I share is a passionate observation of my life, my times as a metaphor of humanity in these troubled times. What I have to show is a way of seeing, a way of life.  Since the 70's I have created images of people, musicians, dancers, poets, laborers, revolutionaries, artists.


The common man as an artist, life as creatively experienced not just existing.  I’ve photographed rock festivals, the Vietnam War, encounters with Abby Hoffman, and Gloria Steinem, just to name a few. I consider my images to be taken by a compassionate observer of the human condition.  
I seek to share my vision of humanity, through a journal of images and words, impressions on a life of photographic art. Poems, essays, tales real and surreal.  I wish to share a life in moments--from the wisdom of age returning to the freedom of  a child.
Contributors will help me with day to day and publishing expenses for this book.  I see this work as a lifelong self-portrait—told through poems, essays, and of course photographs.                                 Peter J. Crowley

What We Need & What You Get


This campaign will be an ongoing process.  The initial funding will be used to catalog my career's work, over 200,000 negatives and 400 pages of written copy.  To catalog these requires a lot of help, and I  would love to start paying my intern.  As great gratitude for you contribution,  you will receive a poster of my original photos from gallery shows (poster created by SL Johnson Images).  I am also offering prints of my words and images married together, a poem and photograph capturing the same emotion, telling a story.
The entire goal is to produce a 150 page book, a monograph comprised of words and images that spans my 45 year career.  If the goal isn't initially reached, the book may be published in installments.  No matter what, it will happen!
   The Impact
 Previously, I published a book titled, ""All the Usual Subjects"" It was a limited-edition monograph reviewed and acclaimed throughout the world.  I've spent 45 years creating photographic art through a compassionate view of humanity.  This book will be a cohesive summary of the creative chapters in my life.  Through this book, I wish to show people my work--how I  fully immersed into a subject and created art in the viewfinder.   
Risks & Challenges
My greatest fear is that the world is content with digital, cell phone images.  That the art world has permanently converted to 72 dpi and has no need for print.  I have followed the same photographic philosophy for 45 years--creating my art in the viewfinder, not in post production.  I live immersed, totally in the moment of the subject.  The images I created with this philosophy are what I wish to share with the world.

<p><strong>The Backstory</strong></p>
<p>Hi! I'm Angelica R. Jackson, a writer and artist in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas.</p>
<p>I'm lucky to live close to a relatively-unknown landmark building, the former Preston School of Industry in Ione, California. Also known as Preston Castle, it was built in 1894 as a boys' reformatory and operated until about 1960, before being abandoned to the elements.</p>
<p>The only people to go inside for the next forty years or so were vandals, caretakers, and local kids. In the meantime, owls, foxes, bats, and other wild residents moved into the decaying structure. And, according to local stories (and even my own experiences), ghosts of the boys continue to haunt the hallways and rooms...</p>
<p>My first chance to go inside Preston Castle came in 2007, and the peeling paint, the smell of musty wood and brick, and the details of craftsmanship which remained, immediately captured my imagination.  I continued to take advantage of opportunities for private and public entry to the Castle over the next ten years, attempting to capture the play of shadows and light in the disused rooms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Preston Castle Foundation was taking steps to preserve and protect the structure for later generations. In the course of restorations,  some of the original, arrested decay which attracted me to the building had been glossed over with fresh coats of paint. Traces left by the wards, and vandals, were disappearing between my visits, with photos being the only lasting proof.</p>
<p><strong>The Goal</strong></p>
<p>I want to bring my favorite images of this forgotten gem to a wider audience and I have assembled them into a photobook. The idea came to me after I printed a catalog of the images I was selling alongside my novel at a vendor booth in the Castle’s basement. I sold a decent amount of novels and photographs that day, but I got several requests to buy the catalog! Foundation members even suggested that I sell it in the gift shop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the version I’d brought to that event was too expensive to produce for sale. I’ve spent the time since then finding a printer (after some false starts, I ended up going with a POD model) and formatting the book. Its sixty pages contain ninety-nine images in a mixture of color and black &amp; white.</p>
<p>The funding goal of $1500  is to cover expenses in producing/designing the book (I hired a cover designer and bought ISBNs), and printing an initial run of fifty copies. Perks and shipping supplies are included, as well as the fees which IndieGoGo and the credit card processors charge.</p>
<p>Some of the perks can ship in April, before the book order is placed, and those are marked accordingly. There aren’t any risks I can think of since I’m not launching this campaign until I have a finished version of the book that I like.</p>
<p>Now, onto the details about the perks!</p>

<p>This vintage-style image was actually shot in 2006, before they replaced the roof. And it does not appear in the book, so this is an exclusive perk for my IndieGoGo supporters!

<p>In 2014, Preston Castle inspired the setting of my young adult, urban fantasy novel. This darkly funny story is set in the fictional town of Crow’s Rest, with its own eerie Castle.

<p>When you select the perk for a print of a photo from the book, you will get a randomly-selected 8x10 or 8x12 print (size varies by photo), plus the postcard.

<h3>""The last thing a homeless person needs is a camera.""</h3>
<p>That quote came directly from a comment on an article on a local media site that featured the project. I would agree that in terms of physical needs, a camera does not go very far in providing food, shelter or clothes. However, a camera is <i>exactly</i> what many of our photographers needed to experience joy, hope and fulfillment.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499818029/r487timep1gbhngzdixp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>How it all began</strong></h3>
<p>We started the Through Our Eyes Project in 2016 by giving out 86 cameras to the homeless in Spartanburg, South Carolina. We asked them to photograph their lives - where they went, who they spent time with, what they valued. The results were incredible. The devastation we saw on the street was shocking. The hope and optimism that many saw despite their situation was encouraging. Their participation was humbling.</p>
<p>Each person received a care bag, a t-shirt that gave them the title of 'photographer' for the week, extra clothes and food. A prayer team was there to help them heal spiritually and provide some hope. A team of judges narrowed down over 800 photos to a top 20 (a hard thing to do!) that hung in an art gallery for a month. The community was invited to come and vote for their favorite photos by placing spare change in a lockbox next to the images that stood out to them. All the money raised went to support local organizations that care for the homeless.

<h3><strong>Why do an Indiegogo campaign?</strong></h3>
<p>We believe in the impact this project has had in our communities and we believe that it can impact many others. Our goal is to print a beautiful 128-page coffee table photography book. We want to provide an opportunity for a permanent, printed piece of the project to be made available. Our gallery exhibits last 30 days, but the books can live on and continue to inspire. Of course, we want people to buy the books, but we also want some to be in schools and libraries, and in the hands of the photographers who took the photos.</p>
<h2>What we're looking for</h2>
<p>We want to raise $10,000.</p>
<p>The funds raised from this campaign will help offset the costs relating to:</p>
<ul>
<li>layout &amp; design</li>
<li>printing the first run of books</li>
<li>purchasing ISBN numbers, barcodes and copyrights</li>
<li>marketing</li>
<li>shipping</li>
<li>swag &amp; incentives</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Speaking of incentives...</h3>
<p>We've got some great perks for you including a limited edition, individually numbered hardcover book, first run t-shirt not offered anywhere else, postcard sets, prints and even an opportunity to put your name in our book as a contributor.</p>

<h3>""I feel like I have a purpose, if only for a week.""</h3>
<p>That's what a photographer told us last year. He was empowered. The proceeds we make from the book sales will help us take the project to new cities and countries and reach more groups of people who are marginalized, vulnerable and need a voice. We want to continue to provide a message of hope and the joy that comes with creating art. You can help make this happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest risk is inactivity. It's the same risk that happens in our communities every day. People drive by someone on the street. There's no eye contact. There's no emotion. There's no desire to help. We want to overcome this by intentionally making people confront homelessness in a real way. I don't see a person on the street anymore. I see Chris or Tonya. I can tell that Scotty got a haircut. I notice when David doesn't come around as much. Even though these names are from Spartanburg, South Carolina, the problem is everywhere.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some reading this can't commit to buy a book. That's perfectly fine. Make a difference in your city. Help in these other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pray. Pray specifically for three things. 1) That homelessness can be eradicated in your city. 2) For the physical, spiritual and emotional needs of the people on the street. 3) For others to take action.</li>
<li>Share this page! You might not be able to invest in the campaign, but you know people who can. Share this and help make a difference, one camera at a time.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>The cameras are disposable. <strong>The people are not.</strong></p></div>","""The last thing a homeless person needs is a camera.""
That quote came directly from a comment on an article on a local media site that featured the project. I would agree that in terms of physical needs, a camera does not go very far in providing food, shelter or clothes. However, a camera is exactly what many of our photographers needed to experience joy, hope and fulfillment.

How it all began
We started the Through Our Eyes Project in 2016 by giving out 86 cameras to the homeless in Spartanburg, South Carolina. We asked them to photograph their lives - where they went, who they spent time with, what they valued. The results were incredible. The devastation we saw on the street was shocking. The hope and optimism that many saw despite their situation was encouraging. Their participation was humbling.
Each person received a care bag, a t-shirt that gave them the title of 'photographer' for the week, extra clothes and food. A prayer team was there to help them heal spiritually and provide some hope. A team of judges narrowed down over 800 photos to a top 20 (a hard thing to do!) that hung in an art gallery for a month. The community was invited to come and vote for their favorite photos by placing spare change in a lockbox next to the images that stood out to them. All the money raised went to support local organizations that care for the homeless. The three photographs that received the most money earned prizes for those photographers to help meet their needs.
The response from the community was so great that we took the project to Greenville, South Carolina, a neighboring city with an even bigger homeless population.

<p>My name is John Beaudine.  I am a  photographer who resides in Fargo, North Dakota.  My prime interest in photography is landscapes.  The biggest factor in my love of photographing landscapes is due to my upbringing.  Having grown up on a lake in front of my home and over a hundred acres of woodland behind, I've had a love for the outdoors for most of my life.  For the past few years, a majority of my photography has been a travelogue focusing on the landscape of the American West/Southwest.  I've always had a fascination with the region thanks in part to artists/filmmakers such as Ansel Adams, Dorothea Lange, John Ford and Wim Wenders.  </p>
<p>On April 26th of this year, President Donald Trump issued an executive order for the Secretary of Interior to review 27 national monuments that were designated between 1996 and 2006 under the Antiquities Act of 1906.  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke submitted his report to the White House on August 24th.  Months before his report was submitted to the White House in late August,  it was already announced that Bears Ears in Utah would be downsized.  As I write this (September 18), it has now been reported that Zinke recommended that there should be changes to more monuments.  Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah, Cascade-Siskiyou in Oregon, Gold Butte in Nevada, Katahdin in Maine, Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks and Rio Grande Del Norte (both in New Mexico) are the other monuments that have been proposed to be downsized.  The majority of the 27 national monuments that were part of the executive order are located in the American West/Southwest. Five are located in the oceans.  Three of these monuments of protected oceans (Northeast Canyons and Seamounts, Rose Atoll and Pacific Remote Islands) were also recommended by Zinke to be changed.  </p>
<p>The project for which I plan to embark on is a travelogue of the national monuments that were under review in Trump's executive order. My plan would be to not just photograph the monuments themselves but also include visits to the towns and the people who live near these impressive monuments. I've already started this project by spending some time at one of the monuments this past July.  The photographs on this page were taken at Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument in Montana.  Naturally, I would love to return there and work on more photography of the monument.  </p>
<p>Due to my current job situation, I am only able to take a certain amount of time off from work.  Currently, my plan is to travel to a few monuments for two to three weeks every few months within the next year and complete these visits before the end of 2018.  </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to begin an exhibition featuring my travels to the monuments at some of the local/regional art galleries with hopes of expanding it beyond North Dakota and Minnesota.  I also plan to publish a book featuring the photography of this journey.  The money for the project would go towards the following:<br/> - Travel expenses (gas/car rental, etc.)<br/> - Admission/camping fees of the monuments <br/> - Art supplies (matte board, frames, etc.) for the exhibition<br/> - Printing fees for the book </p>
<p>The perks from this project will include a pack of 20 postcards featuring  the monuments, copies of the book and prints (unframed and framed) presented in different sizes that feature a photograph of one of the monuments.   <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505758631/kyy5zdnsrs2dxfmkpnek.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I hope to begin a discussion with others about these National Monuments and about the importance of preserving what’s left of our nation’s untamed wilderness.  I feel that many people may not be familiar with the significance of these monuments.  Even when talking to a few of friends about this, they were unfamiliar with the monuments and wanted to learn more (ex. Are these monuments statues or buildings?  Or are these areas of land that could be like a national park?) Talking with others about the National Parks may be easy but what about the National Monuments?  Why are these preserved lands only monuments and not National Parks?  What are the stories behind them?  Is there a reason why these 27 monuments were targeted by Trump?  And what do the people who live near the monuments have to say about the whole executive order?  <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505758663/uaandf0i3klglhvzvwdi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In my view, the biggest risk of this project is not knowing what the future holds for these monuments that face enormous changes.  As stated before, it was announced at the time of writing this proposal how many of the monuments would be downsized.   I've always viewed photography as a way of capturing a moment in time.  I need to visit these monuments before the possible changes to them begin and to capture with my cameras  the way they appeared at this precise moment in time.  </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot afford to contribute to this campaign, you can always spread the word.  You can easily post a link on any social media platform (Facebook, Twitter, etc).  If you know friends or relatives that have an interest in our preserved lands, this might be a project that they may find interesting and would love to contribute to.  Word of mouth is a key factor in helping meet this campaign's goal.</p>

<p>My name is Farrah Aviva. In May, 2018 I created <i>BITE THE BULLET stories</i> with the intention of doing a side project to give back.  I never expected it to resonate with as many people as it has or as quickly as it did. The support and enthusiasm people have shown is beyond what I could have ever imagined. I am a person who is driven by passion and this project engulfed me from day one. From the outset, <i>BITE THE BULLET stories</i> took on a life of it's own and I wholeheartedly devoted myself to it.  Through this experience I've seen first-hand the transformational impact the project has had on not only those who have shared their stories, but also on the overwhelming number of people who have been inspired by them.  Of the 15 stories I've published since May, on <i>Instagram </i>alone there are close to 1 million likes and over 7,000 comments, not to mention the thousands of engagements on <i>Twitter</i> and <i>Facebook,</i> as well. <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>  has also recently featured one of the stories.</p>

<p>While I've been blown away by the momentum the project has garnered it has rapidly become clear to me that <i>BITE THE BULLET stories </i>is potentially tapping into something far bigger.

<div>Until this point, I've been a one-woman show, seeing to every aspect of the campaign - interviewing, photoshoots, prop building, styling, editing, video creation, social media management, merchandise development and creation, publicity, research development, etc. It's been exhilarating and the most fulfilling work I've ever done.  But I can't do this on my own anymore.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm 'Biting the Bullet' to open up and share the most vulnerable thing that I could possibly admit: I'm tapped out and I need help. By not working and dedicating all my time to this I've in turn used all my resources over the past few months. But I am fully dedicated to seeing this through. I refuse to let this project die.</div>

<br/>I believe <i>BITE THE BULLET stories</i> can play a humble part in changing the world for the better.  We live in a time where humanity is more interconnected than it's ever been. Yet that has also somehow paradoxically made us more isolated.  We're all perfectly imperfect and we each have stories, and causes we want to fight for. This campaign endeavors to turn the tables by sharing our imperfections along with our passions in order to create change and inspire those around us.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Everyday I'm contacted by people who have been touched by this campaign and wish to share their stories. I want to keep going.</div>

<div> </div>
<p>With your help, I believe I can build BITE THE BULLET Stories into a platform that stretches beyond social media. It has the potential to grow into a global community people turn to when they need support, inspiration, motivation and a voice. I also believe we can create awareness around causes that need it.  Below are just a few of the avenues I've already begun to develop:</p>

<p>I'm hoping to raise these funds to cover the cost of operating until the end of the year as well as pay for things such a trademark, incorporating fees, a legal retainer and a part time assistant so I can not only continue BITE THE BULLET Stories, but also take it to the next level. </p>
<p>This is a list of costs I anticipate needing to cover before 2019.</p>

<p>There is a mobile device photography trend in full swing.
Never before have so many people concurrently had the means to capture and
share a moment, a vision<span>  …and with
creating fantastic pixel resolution, enough to make a quality photograph of a
certain size.</span></p>
<p><b><i>mobile device photography: Darkness</i></b></p>
<p>A book that will put into physical existence the
photographs from people around the world captured on their mobile devices.
Rarely does a moment from the picture files of our phones or tablets become an object as we no longer tend towards photo albums. This book is a
collection of objets d’art made from photographic capture of iPhone, Blackberry
and other mobile devices. A technology that has replaced pocket-sized 35mm film
cameras and enabled many more to collect snap shots and create photographic
artworks only because we happen to carry the camera close to our person at all times in
our mobile devices.</p>
<p>The first book published by Print Oculus<i> mobile device photography: Enlightenment </i>has been available since Spring 2013. A much-loved
publication partially funded by the indiegogo community whom we humbly thank.
Because of high demand and with balance to <i>Enlightenment</i> Oculus
Arts called for submissions to <i>Darkness</i>, once again inviting mobile device
photographers to comment on a theme. These are now edited into a great looking
copy of the second book that perfectly compliments the first. The design of
<i>Darkness</i> is reminiscent of its counter part and with about the same number of
submissions will also be about the same size. <br/></p>
<p>A call for submissions went as wide as we could and people
from all kinds of places responded with their photographs and thoughts.
Previously published mobile device photographers are among the artists alongside those also inspired to see their capture in
print. Everyone who submitted will be published in the book and a sweet quirk of the layout is
 that the photographs are shown in the order of when they were received. Accompanying the mobile device photographs, a brief
sentence or two gives a little insight into who we are of all ages and
genetics. Under the Gallery tab are pages from <i>Enlightenment</i> as an example of this and some other photos of interest. For <i>Darkness</i> Daniel Berman, Mobile Photo Awards founder and artist, writes for us an essay.
</p><p>The book <i>mobile device photography: Enlightenment</i><span> has been found in Street Level Gallery,
Glasgow, UK and in QSQ Giclee Boutique, Toronto, Canada. It was available for
loan at Glasgow School of Art Library until the devastating fire last year.</span></p>
<p>Your contribution will enable us
to make another Objet d’Art, a book, the first edition print-run of one hundred copies only - <i>mobile device photography: Darkness</i>. Your contribution will also provide encouragement to make photographic art and then if for no other reason to contribute to this book
there's always because it makes people feel really good celebrating their
creativity in the slightest of ways.</p>

A call for submissions went as wide as we could and people
from all kinds of places responded with their photographs and thoughts.
Previously published mobile device photographers are among the artists alongside those also inspired to see their capture in
print. Everyone who submitted will be published in the book and a sweet quirk of the layout is
 that the photographs are shown in the order of when they were received. Accompanying the mobile device photographs, a brief
sentence or two gives a little insight into who we are of all ages and
genetics. Under the Gallery tab are pages from Enlightenment as an example of this and some other photos of interest. For Darkness Daniel Berman, Mobile Photo Awards founder and artist, writes for us an essay.
The book mobile device photography: Enlightenment has been found in Street Level Gallery,
Glasgow, UK and in QSQ Giclee Boutique, Toronto, Canada. It was available for
loan at Glasgow School of Art Library until the devastating fire last year.
Your contribution will enable us
to make another Objet d’Art, a book, the first edition print-run of one hundred copies only - mobile device photography: Darkness. Your contribution will also provide encouragement to make photographic art and then if for no other reason to contribute to this book
there's always because it makes people feel really good celebrating their
creativity in the slightest of ways.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

My name is Vikram Dogra.  I am a photographer based in Astoria, a neighborhood in Queens, New York City. Upon moving to the neighborhood 14 years ago, I instantly fell in love with Astoria and began photographing it. I've composed a photo book titled, East of East River: A Decade of Street Photography in Astoria & Long Island City, Queens, NY 2005-2014. With about 140 black & white and color images, the book is born out of a decade of labor of love for a unique part of New York City, separated from Manhattan by East River and connected to it by two beautiful bridges; so close and worlds apart...
A Special Book 
East of East River (EOER) is the first of its kind as a photo book focusing on the special New York City neighborhoods Astoria and Long Island City. East side of East River has been an immigrants' crossroad for almost 400 years. Reflecting that heritage, its landscape is a mix of industrial, suburban, commercial buildings and projects, warehouses, mom & pop stores, laundromats, barbers, bakeries, cafes, repair shops, car dealers, bodegas, beer gardens, parks, bridges and museums.  EOER captures a vibrant portrait of Astoria/LIC as a cultural melting pot, defined by a unique authenticity offering amazing food, music, literature and arts.
East of East River (EOER) offers a portrait of the everyday life in Astoria/LIC from the perspective of those who do live and work here. It is also an archival history of a dynamic, fast-changing neighborhood at the first decade of the new century. The photographs capture the renewal but also the loss of the unique landscape. For those rooted here, or whose paths have crossed through, the images will bring back memories of a diverse community and of places that used to be. Others living far and away might find something familiar in those same images that is reminiscent of their own corners of world, and maybe feel an urge to come and explore ours. 
There is a growing interest in Queens and a recognition of its richness not only in this country but around the world, as evidenced by its designation as the top U.S. destination for 2015 by Lonely Planet. As New York is a world city and Queens is a world borough, Astoria/LIC is a world neighborhood, a neighborhood that encapsulates the whole world. EOER is a record and celebration of the many worlds that converge on the East of East River.


Final Stage of Funding and Publishing with Your Support
The essential steps in completion of this book such as photography, editing and design are completed. The last integral stage of publishing is printing a quality limited set and getting the book to your hands and with your help to many more people. The goal needed to get EOER printed and pay for shipping/delivery and other fund raising related costs is $10,000.00.  The money will fund the following necessary logistic costs (as percent of budget): 
Print cost of limited edition set of 2000 books (55%). Shipping costs from printer to NYC and shipping cost for books and prints for campaign supporters (20%). Production cost for E-Book/App version (10%). Sales taxes and Indiegogo fundraising cost (15%).


Additional Funds exceeding the goal will afford a print order of a larger quantity of books based on Indiegogo sales, and toward production cost of E-book/app guide.


    The Impact I put together this East of East River as a personal memento of the wonderful journey and discovery of a great part of New York City and Queens.  I hope you will share my sentiment in enjoying this book.  Your support in making EOER a reality is absolutely integral.   I am humbly grateful and thank you for all your support.
