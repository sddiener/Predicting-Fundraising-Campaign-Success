<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Jericho is a story about a found family forced into a guarded city, a city controlled by the remnants of the military of their civil war-torn country. The city promises safety and security, but their security comes at a high price...<br/><br/>My name is Rachel Mumaw and I am the author of Jericho. I wrote this book because I love gritty, thrilling dystopian fiction and I wanted to write a novel in that genre, and I wanted to write a story that was more inclusive of diverse identities, including race, gender, and sexual identities.<br/><br/>I want this story to help you discover the importance of community, especially as a part of resistance to authoritarianism. I want this book to be an escape into a thrilling adventure that also invites you to observe your own communities. You may see ways in which your neighbors and friends have similar needs to the characters in Jericho.<br/><br/>The story of Jericho begins with Riley Jay, their partner Sergio, and their new-found family Ian and Jen as they travel through a pale desert. It’s all that remains of a thriving city that’s been reduced to rubble through bombs and bullets; ash swirls with every footstep, and what isn’t scorched by fire has been blasted by sand in the ensuing years. It’s a harsh world where supplies are scarce and even the fittest may not survive.<br/><br/>Riley Jay, Sergio, Ian, and Jen are survivors of the Collapse, a violent political takeover that sparked a still-raging civil war. All four resolve to remain independent and impartial from the conflict, but when tragedy strikes they are forced into Jericho, a city controlled by the Command. The remnants of the country’s former military, the Command promises them more safety and stability than their life on the road could ever offer, and at first, the promises seem to be true. That is, until Riley Jay is secretly “recruited” to provide medical care to those who otherwise cannot access it, a service that is firmly illegal within Jericho’s walls. As the Command tightens its grip on dissenters and Riley Jay is asked to take increasingly dangerous tasks, they will have to decide whether the health of their community is worth the safety of their family.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you love gritty, thrilling dystopian fiction and are looking for a novel that is fast-paced yet asks serious questions about the importance of community and the nature of safety and security.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Jericho inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p>What responsibilities do we have to our community?</p>
<p>Do our responsibilities to our families outweigh our responsibilities to our communities?</p>
<p>What does being “safe” and “secure” actually mean?</p>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing family, community, and security will change us all for the better. </p>

<h3>
<strong>Kids in Cuffs: Striving for Equity and Empathy in Education</strong> looks at antiquated school codes of conduct that are detrimental to students.</h3>
<p>Can you imagine being a student who uses their cell phone in class and then being arrested by school police? Many students across the nation, specifically Black and brown students, experience harsh school discipline that results in suspensions, expulsions, and even arrest. <br/><br/>My name is <strong>Ar’Sheill Monsanto and I am the author of Kids in Cuffs: Striving for Equity and Empathy in Education</strong>. I wrote this book because twenty years ago I had a traumatic experience with punitive school discipline practices. Today, many of those practices have been exacerbated and as a parent I believe we can redefine a system that doesn't criminalize students. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, <strong>you will learn more about education policies as they relate to school discipline</strong>. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for equity and policy change. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to helping you understand policy, systems, and school environments. These will be tools and frameworks you can use to enact change. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about school discipline and how racism perpetuates gaps in equity. You'll hear...</p>
<ul>
<li>Stories about Black students being suspended from school during virtual learning</li>
<li>What role school-based law enforcement plays in school discipline</li>
<li>How certain school districts are pioneering new efforts to address student behavior in an equitable way</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are a problem solver looking for innovative solutions that change behavior and instill equity. <br/><br/><strong>Kids in Cuffs: Striving for Equity and Empathy in Education</strong> is a nonfiction book that speaks to parents, educators, school leaders, and policy makers who want to look at school discipline and equity in education in a new way.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>Kids in Cuffs: Striving for Equity and Empathy in Education</strong>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in three parts:<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction and chapters 1-3. These chapters look at the history of school discipline policies including the introduction of police into schools. I also share stories of actual students and their experiences with school discipline and even use of force by school-based law enforcement. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 5-7 which looks at school districts and education policies that have adopted practices that are more restorative. This section includes research and interviews from school districts that have adopted and implemented restorative justice programs to counteract exclusionary discipline. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 8, the final chapter. In this section I share a framework more commonly used in public health to change behaviors. I believe this framework could work to reform school discipline policies in an effort to promote equity for all students. <br/> </p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>The Resiliency Effect</i><br/><br/>Behind every strong and powerful woman is a set of adversities she probably doesn’t speak about. Not facing them directly leads to burnout or even stagnation and roadblocks in life. Most people I work with can name several big dreams they have for themselves. Everyone thinks they’ll get to it “one day.” And, everyone thinks there’s a specific productivity, life, or financial hack that will somehow lead to a more fulfilling life.<br/><br/>My name is Cady North and I am the author of The Resiliency Effect. I wrote this book because we often focus on the outward steps we must take to achieve our dreams. The truth is, there are internal steps we must take too. To start, we all have a status quo bias. It feels safe for us to keep the status quo instead of doing the work necessary to live our biggest dreams. Knowing about this bias isn’t enough, we have to actively choose a different path.<br/><br/>My hope in reading this book is you will discover reaching your dreams is not about getting another rung on the career ladder, working harder or finding another life or productivity hack. I hope to instill a passion and excitement for focusing on your inner journey. Ultimately, I want you to see this as a tool to help you launch your biggest dreams.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how to make sure your inner journey matches your outer journey. The common denominator of the 50+ people I profiled in the book is that they made a big change to live a life more in sync with their purpose and passions. Learn from their stories and insights which unfold over three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to Move From Surviving to Thriving</li>
<li>Success Catalysts</li>
<li>Launching Your Big Dreams</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>You will love this book if you are someone who is successful in their careers but aren’t feeling fulfilled. Or if you’ve ever said, I want to start a business, take a sabbatical or retire early “one day” but aren’t quite sure how to get there.<br/><br/>The Resiliency Effect is a non-fiction book that speaks to professional women who are looking at next steps in their careers or desire to find more meaning in their lives.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Book - The Resiliency Effect</h2>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + Chapters 1-4. It digs into why we’re so prone to burnout and how to go from surviving to thriving in your life and your career. We also examine how the cycle of trauma, as well as how the health effects of adversity are passed down within families.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 5-8. This part reviews success catalysts you can employ to live your biggest dreams. Discover the common ways of finding resilience including how to unlearn coping mechanisms, how being vulnerable can be a catalyst for change, the role cross-functional learning plays in success, and ways to unearth and lean into your passions in life.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 9-12 and a conclusion. These chapters help you explore your mindset, motivation and fears behind common dreams. I chose to write about four “big dreams” including taking a sabbatical, changing careers, starting a business and retiring early because they are the dreams most often shared with me by prospects and clients in my work as a financial planner. Each of these chapters ends with a worksheet to help you sort through your thoughts.</p>

</div><p>Thank you so much for your support!<br/><br/>Cady North</p></div>","Updates:
With less than two days left in the campaign, I'm now donating 25% of all pre-order sales to the Hurston/Wright Foundation which discovers, mentors and honors Black writers.  The rest of the funds will be used for my book launch and book tour.   
Note the Special ""author champion"" perk where you get 5 copies of my book + an hour long consult with me.  This is like a mini financial planning session and normally costs $699.  
The Resiliency Effect was featured on a recent episode of the iSmart Podcast and will be featured on an upcoming episode of Money Savage Podcast and The Thoughtful Entrepreneur Podcast.
Story of My Book
The Resiliency EffectBehind every strong and powerful woman is a set of adversities she probably doesn’t speak about. Not facing them directly leads to burnout or even stagnation and roadblocks in life. Most people I work with can name several big dreams they have for themselves. Everyone thinks they’ll get to it “one day.” And, everyone thinks there’s a specific productivity, life, or financial hack that will somehow lead to a more fulfilling life.My name is Cady North and I am the author of The Resiliency Effect. I wrote this book because we often focus on the outward steps we must take to achieve our dreams. The truth is, there are internal steps we must take too. To start, we all have a status quo bias. It feels safe for us to keep the status quo instead of doing the work necessary to live our biggest dreams. Knowing about this bias isn’t enough, we have to actively choose a different path.My hope in reading this book is you will discover reaching your dreams is not about getting another rung on the career ladder, working harder or finding another life or productivity hack. I hope to instill a passion and excitement for focusing on your inner journey. Ultimately, I want you to see this as a tool to help you launch your biggest dreams.In this book, you'll learn about how to make sure your inner journey matches your outer journey. The common denominator of the 50+ people I profiled in the book is that they made a big change to live a life more in sync with their purpose and passions. Learn from their stories and insights which unfold over three parts:

Only 7.3 percent of federal employees are younger than 30, compared to 23 percent of private sector workers (Office of Personnel Management, 2020). The societal issues we face now and will continue to face in the future are immense.

I want you to see this book as an opportunity to think critically about the very structure of the United States government and how we can change it for the better. Ultimately, I want you to think about what a service-driven career looks like and how we can all live mission-oriented lives. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about why the government hiring process fails young people and how to fix it.

We started with a tiny little 3x5 letterpress, and with the help of our awesome community, we've made more than 20 publications, from hand-sewn chapbooks to floppy disk ebooks, to an accordion book that stretches all the way across the room, and a manifesto in the shape of a trash can. We've also turned our fictional lecture series, Meekling TALKS, into an annual tradition.

<h3>What is the story behind the book?</h3>
<p>My name is Ryan Conner, and I am the author of “One Man, One Vote”: Northern Ireland’s Civil Rights Movement, 1963-1972. Using published interviews and video footage, the book examines how Catholic and Protestant civilians, who lived primarily in Belfast and Derry, experienced the movement, which began in the early 1960s in response to the Northern Irish government's discrimination against Catholics in areas such as housing, jobs, and voting. Many grassroots activists aspired to and insisted on using non-violent methods to pursue their goals. Yet violence broke out when the Northern Irish police led baton charges, as is now well-documented, against civil rights activists at their first major demonstration in Derry in autumn 1968.</p>
<p>Civil rights activists continued organizing demonstrations well into 1969. Yet there now was frequent violence among marchers, counter-protesters, and the police. Traditional cultural parades soon became sites of violence in August 1969, and British troops intervened to restore ""law and order""--a phrase frequently used by observers in 1969. Many Catholic civilians cautiously welcomed the troops to protect them from the Northern Irish police forces, which were largely Protestant. The troops were supposed to stay only temporarily.<br/><br/>Yet within three years, British snipers shot and killed thirteen civilians at a civil rights protest in Derry in January 1972, turning many previously optimistic Catholics toward the paramilitary Provisional Irish Republican Army. This Bloody Sunday, as it became known, escalated the then-ongoing armed conflict between the Irish paramilitaries and British security forces.<br/><br/>The dynamics of the civil rights movement and the armed conflict are complex: how and why did violence unfold and escalate in the late 1960s and early 1970s? Did structural conditions in Northern Ireland make conflict inevitable? Or was conflict the result of particular decisions made by a variety of political and social actors? What are the legacies today?<br/><br/>I have been developing this book through a popular open program at Georgetown University and with the support of professional editors and publishers at New Degree Press. I selected this topic to explore Northern Ireland’s history, having both traveled to the Republic of Ireland last year and developed research interests in twentieth-century international history. Although the COVID-19 crisis has led many libraries and archives to close and made travel to Northern Ireland impossible, many Northern Irish institutions have resources available online. I have also turned to an outstanding, trans-Atlantic network of independent bookstores and sellers. Both have been invaluable for my research. I intend to travel to Northern Ireland as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Today’s landscape in the United States is beyond the scope of this book, yet it is imperative to acknowledge that the protests and the response have had some remarkable echoes, as I hope you’ll realize, of Northern Ireland’s 1960s civil rights movement and the landscape of memorials there today. There are important similarities, but also very notable differences, as with all historical analogies. Nevertheless, the past can illuminate the present across time and across societies in sometimes unexpected, yet welcome, ways.</p>
<h3>So what?</h3>
<p>I hope that the book will attune you to the power of the stories that are told about the past not only in Northern Ireland, but anywhere around the world, especially today in the United States. The ultimate purpose of the book is to persuade you that studying history is valuable to making sense of the present, especially in the aftermath of conflict.</p>
<h3>Why should you pre-order the book?</h3>I need to pre-sell 120 paperback copies of the book in order to publish it. If you would like to pre-order it, please know that your funds will help cover the following costs:<ul>
<li>working with a team of editors to revise and publish the manuscript in December 2020;</li>

Tamir Rice. Six names pulled from a list of thousands of black men and women unjustly murdered at the hands of law enforcement. A list of mothers and fathers. A list of daughters and sons. A list of sisters and brothers. A list of people with their lives ahead of them, with hopes, dreams, and plans for a tomorrow that didn’t come. These are the names that sparked one of the largest global calls for social justice the world has ever seen.<br/><br/>From the bushfires in Australia to the outbreak of the coronavirus and America’s greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, the events of 2020 underscored the need for a serious assessment of the status quo.<br/><br/>These intersecting crises have laid bare the existing institutional failures that the world has failed to address for decades, arguably centuries. These issues are not new. Healthcare has never been a universal right in the United States. Science has always been political. People of color have been unjustly murdered at the hands of law enforcement for centuries. What <i>is</i> new is the public discourse and open dialogue that this crisis has inspired.<br/><br/>Against this backdrop, should we ever go back to normal? Perhaps normal never quite served us.<br/><br/>I’m Jordan Johnson. My book, <i>It Took a Crisis</i>, takes a multi-disciplinary approach to exploring how the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed wide ranging cracks in our social structures and accelerated a global call to action. This shared experience has unlocked something powerful in us as global citizens, enabling us to reimagine a more equitable world.<br/><br/>Through interviews, research, and storytelling, you will meet:</p><ul>
<li>Dr. Robert Patterson, Chair of the African American Studies department at Georgetown University, who shares his perspective on the link between COVID-19 and the social justice movements that culminated during the summer of 2020.</li>

George Floyd. Philando Castile. Tamir Rice. Six names pulled from a list of thousands of black men and women unjustly murdered at the hands of law enforcement. A list of mothers and fathers. A list of daughters and sons. A list of sisters and brothers. A list of people with their lives ahead of them, with hopes, dreams, and plans for a tomorrow that didn’t come. These are the names that sparked one of the largest global calls for social justice the world has ever seen.From the bushfires in Australia to the outbreak of the coronavirus and America’s greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, the events of 2020 underscored the need for a serious assessment of the status quo.These intersecting crises have laid bare the existing institutional failures that the world has failed to address for decades, arguably centuries. These issues are not new. Healthcare has never been a universal right in the United States. Science has always been political. People of color have been unjustly murdered at the hands of law enforcement for centuries. What is new is the public discourse and open dialogue that this crisis has inspired.Against this backdrop, should we ever go back to normal? Perhaps normal never quite served us.I’m Jordan Johnson. My book, It Took a Crisis, takes a multi-disciplinary approach to exploring how the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed wide ranging cracks in our social structures and accelerated a global call to action. This shared experience has unlocked something powerful in us as global citizens, enabling us to reimagine a more equitable world.Through interviews, research, and storytelling, you will meet:
Dr. Robert Patterson, Chair of the African American Studies department at Georgetown University, who shares his perspective on the link between COVID-19 and the social justice movements that culminated during the summer of 2020.
Sana Altaf, Innovation Designer at a top management consulting firm, who shares how inclusive innovation can solve many of the problems highlighted by the pandemic from vaccines to economic relief.
Maggie Kervick, Corporate Impact Specialist, who describes COVID-19 as a trial run for a much greater climate crisis to come.

But it’s about more than ticking sites off a list or following a guide book. The truly unique and enriching experiences often come through the local people you meet. People give you an insight to a place which you couldn’t get otherwise.</p><p>So Beings is a collection of stories, photos and illustrations exploring this theme. The real-life people in the magazine are funny, serious, heartwarming and heartbreaking. And from all over the world.</p><p>In the age of Brexit and travel bans, this is a celebration cultural difference. Going to different places helps us meet people who aren’t like us. Yet there's often something that connects us. And that’s a good thing.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511625806/worgjzpvzplksn5o1zrr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>What’s in the magazine?</strong></p><p>We have 9 articles about the human side of travel for you to get your teeth into. Here’s a taster:</p><ul>
<li>A lying hitchhiker in Cuba</li>
<li>An Indian food-lover who never got round to keeping a promise he made to his friend</li>
<li>Finding sisterhood on a train across Tanzania </li>
<li>A man in Cambodia who survived the Khmer Rouge and grew up to give a new generation the opportunities he never had</li>
<li>The story of meeting both a kindred spirit and a witch by a mystical lake in Ghana</li>
</ul><p>An extract from 'The top five fruits in Cuba': </p><p><i>""Seven years ago this year, my friend made the somewhat bizarre decision to allow a strange hitchhiker to join us on a road trip </i><i>in</i><i> Cuba. </i></p><p><i>His name was Ernesto (the Cuban hitchhiker, that is. My friend’s name is Mike. From Stockport). He told us he needed the lift as he was going to collect his dance award. It had to be said, Ernesto didn’t look like a dancer. He was no taller than 5 foot, was a little overweight, wearing </i><i>an ill</i><i> fitting tracksuit top and when he smiled he revealed a mouth that boasted only three teeth.</i></p><p><i>We were on our way from Varadero to the Bay of Pigs – driving across pot-holed roads, slowed down by donkeys pulling carts. I was half </i><i>asleep in</i><i> the back when, only 20 minutes into the journey, we drove through a small run of houses and a crossroads and suddenly came to an abrupt stop. The door next to me opened. I was a little surprised as I looked, </i><i>bleary eyed</i><i> to my right, as a short, squat Cuban man (slash dancer) sat down next to me and introduced himself. </i></p><p><i>My friend returned to the driver’s seat seemingly unaware this was quite a strange thing to do in a foreign country where we knew no one, didn't speak the language and had no way of contacting anyone.""</i></p><p>We have more stories too, as well as beautiful photo essays from South Africa, Nepal and Cuba.</p><p><strong>Why print?</strong></p><p>These are well-written stories from different people who have made a connection with someone from across the world. These are beautiful photos and illustrations that capture the excitement of discovering a new place with the help of a local.</p><p>They deserve to be more than content for just another travel blog. They deserve to be more than just something else we scroll past on our social feeds.</p><p>And you deserve to hold something physical in your hands which you can enjoy, free from distraction.</p><p>Engaging stories, beautiful illustration and eye-catching photography brought together through great design. That’s how Beings will tell the human side of travel.</p><p><strong>Is this for me?</strong></p><p>Do you like seeing new places with the help of a local? Do you want more than a guidebook can give you? Do you wonder what it would be like to up sticks and live in a different country?</p><p>Do you enjoy good writing and beautiful illustration? Are you a fan of independent publishing and stunning photography?  </p><p>If so, Beings is for you. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511625866/z0sfcdgidhgywxu3zwfs.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Who is behind Beings?</strong></p><p>I am a writer and editor from Nottingham. I recently left my job to travel for a while and as much as the food, places or experiences, it was the people that left a real impression on me. Now I want to tell the stories of some of those people.</p><p>I knew Sophie Gordon and Fiona McKenzie through work and they both got involved as they loved the idea of Beings. </p><p>Sophie is a copywriter by day, specialising in the charity sector. But she loves getting involved with other writing and design projects on the side. She's also an active member of writers' group 26, and is an associate editor for their newsletter.</p><p>Fiona is a designer and art director who cut her teeth in the charity sector, before going freelance.

But it’s about more than ticking sites off a list or following a guide book. The truly unique and enriching experiences often come through the local people you meet. People give you an insight to a place which you couldn’t get otherwise.So Beings is a collection of stories, photos and illustrations exploring this theme. The real-life people in the magazine are funny, serious, heartwarming and heartbreaking. And from all over the world.In the age of Brexit and travel bans, this is a celebration cultural difference. Going to different places helps us meet people who aren’t like us. Yet there's often something that connects us. And that’s a good thing.What’s in the magazine?We have 9 articles about the human side of travel for you to get your teeth into. Here’s a taster:
A lying hitchhiker in Cuba
An Indian food-lover who never got round to keeping a promise he made to his friend
Finding sisterhood on a train across Tanzania 
A man in Cambodia who survived the Khmer Rouge and grew up to give a new generation the opportunities he never had
The story of meeting both a kindred spirit and a witch by a mystical lake in Ghana
An extract from 'The top five fruits in Cuba': ""Seven years ago this year, my friend made the somewhat bizarre decision to allow a strange hitchhiker to join us on a road trip in Cuba. His name was Ernesto (the Cuban hitchhiker, that is. My friend’s name is Mike. From Stockport). He told us he needed the lift as he was going to collect his dance award. It had to be said, Ernesto didn’t look like a dancer. He was no taller than 5 foot, was a little overweight, wearing an ill fitting tracksuit top and when he smiled he revealed a mouth that boasted only three teeth.We were on our way from Varadero to the Bay of Pigs – driving across pot-holed roads, slowed down by donkeys pulling carts. I was half asleep in the back when, only 20 minutes into the journey, we drove through a small run of houses and a crossroads and suddenly came to an abrupt stop. The door next to me opened. I was a little surprised as I looked, bleary eyed to my right, as a short, squat Cuban man (slash dancer) sat down next to me and introduced himself. My friend returned to the driver’s seat seemingly unaware this was quite a strange thing to do in a foreign country where we knew no one, didn't speak the language and had no way of contacting anyone.""We have more stories too, as well as beautiful photo essays from South Africa, Nepal and Cuba.Why print?These are well-written stories from different people who have made a connection with someone from across the world. These are beautiful photos and illustrations that capture the excitement of discovering a new place with the help of a local.They deserve to be more than content for just another travel blog. They deserve to be more than just something else we scroll past on our social feeds.And you deserve to hold something physical in your hands which you can enjoy, free from distraction.Engaging stories, beautiful illustration and eye-catching photography brought together through great design. That’s how Beings will tell the human side of travel.Is this for me?Do you like seeing new places with the help of a local? Do you want more than a guidebook can give you? Do you wonder what it would be like to up sticks and live in a different country?Do you enjoy good writing and beautiful illustration? Are you a fan of independent publishing and stunning photography?  If so, Beings is for you. Who is behind Beings?I am a writer and editor from Nottingham. I recently left my job to travel for a while and as much as the food, places or experiences, it was the people that left a real impression on me. Now I want to tell the stories of some of those people.I knew Sophie Gordon and Fiona McKenzie through work and they both got involved as they loved the idea of Beings. Sophie is a copywriter by day, specialising in the charity sector. But she loves getting involved with other writing and design projects on the side. She's also an active member of writers' group 26, and is an associate editor for their newsletter.Fiona is a designer and art director who cut her teeth in the charity sector, before going freelance. She now takes on projects for a range of agencies and clients, and is still particularly passionate about design that can make a real difference.But it’s not just us. Beings also features writers who have written for the Guardian, Suitcase Magazine and London in Stereo Magazine. We have a famous Mumbai food blogger. And people who just met someone a bit different while traveling.Our illustrators and photographers have worked with Like the Wind magazine, BBC iWonder and After Nyne Magazine.They’re all brought together to tell the human side of travel.The specsBeings magazine is a brand new publication.

<h3>The Glass Cake: A Summary</h3>
<p>""I can't stop writing,"" Cruickshank says. ""I do it every day, and the reason I write is to discover the reason I write, why I'm fascinated by the topics I choose. It's a pleasant, satisfying affliction. I don't have a single point of view; I have several. And of course my points of view have changed markedly over the years and decades. It's as if my writing studio is a hall of mirrors, or my spectacles are kaleidoscopic.""</p>
<p>""I love the human landscape -- interior and exterior -- so word and picture portraits are my favorite art forms. And I find the exhilaration, loneliness and rigor of travel is great fuel for creation.""</p>
<p>These essays came about when Cruickshank was working full-time as a non-fiction writer. ""Well, mostly non-fiction,"" he says. ""I struggle to tell the truth, just like other non-fiction writers and even journalists, but sometimes it gets away from me. As Steinbeck points out in 'Sweet Thursday,' 'Just because something didn't necessarily happen, doesn't necessarily mean it's a lie... There's a hole in reality through which we can look if we wish.""</p>
<p>""These are all written pieces of my past,"" Cruickshank explains. ""The most recent was published more than 10 years ago, and the earliest were published almost 30 years ago. I seldom work like this anymore. Nowadays I'm living in a different context physically and intellectually.""</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's a breakdown of how the funds will be spent:</p>
<ul>
<li>To bring the project to completion will require $15,000. This money will be spent on a small amount of additional design (the book is about 95% designed already and in ready-to-print Creative Suite files). Funds will also be spent on promotion (a 4 city book store tour) and distribution.</li>
<li>All donors will receive thank you gifts (""perks"" in Indiegogo jargon), these will include having your name on the acknowledgements page (unless you request anonymity), one or more free books depending on your level of giving, participation in a video conference with the author, during which you can ask any questions you like about the work.</li>
<li>What if the funding goal is not reached? The project will go ahead and the book will still be published, but it will take considerably longer to complete.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>There is little risk involved except what I've mentioned above. If the total funds are not raised, the project will still be completed (I'm determined!) but it will take a bit longer to publish the book.</p>

<p>A few years ago, in the pub after a poetry workshop, Alex Bell and I started talking about our shared love of David Bowie, and at some point the conversation developed into one of those ‘wouldn’t it be brilliant if’ conversations. Wouldn’t it be brilliant if we could get a room full of people singing karaoke versions of Bowie songs. So with the help of the internet, my laptop, a TV and a slightly bemused pub in Farringdon, Bowieoke was actually happening. It was inevitable that we’d incorporate poems into the evening too, and we commissioned some poets we love and knew to be big Bowie fans to write us brand new poems based on their favourite Bowie album. They were all brilliant. Many of them knocked it out of the park with the karaoke too (Dai George’s TCV15 being especially memorable).</p>
<p>Then, in January this year, the unthinkable happened and Bowie died. Like everyone, we were devastated. I listened to nothing but Blackstar non-stop for a couple of weeks, then branched out into the back catalogue, and I read the poems, and re-read the poems.</p>
<p>A couple of months after that we had a chat with an editorial assistant at The Rialto, who told us they were looking to put some kind of anthology pamphlet together. Fortunately for us, this editorial assistant was Abigail Parry, who had been one of the poets we’d commissioned for Bowieoke, so they asked us if we wanted to make a pamphlet using the poems we already had, and commissioning some new ones. A project which we couldn’t be happier about, particularly given how beautifully designed <i>The Rialto’s</i> pamphlets are.</p>
<p>But of course, in order to get there it’s going to cost some, ahem, Red Money, and that’s where, if you like the sound of this, we’d like your help.</p>

<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>My name is Celine Koropchak, and I have been receiving messages for over 25 years from my guides, whom I lovingly refer to as my Tovarysh (pronounced: Toe-<strong>Vahsh</strong>). Tovarysh is the Slavic word for friends, and these guides have most definitely been my loving friends since I was a child. Even though their messages have always been gentle and loving, for the longest time, I only shared them with my closest friends. I guess I should have known that one day I would be asked to share these words with the world. That request came about four years ago.</p>
<p>Being the private person that I am, my immediate response was, ‘You want me to do <i>what?’</i> I didn’t know what people would think of me, and besides, how would I even do this? But I could never say no to my Tovarysh, and so I started with a blog, <a href=""https://thetovaryshconnection.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TheTovaryshConnection</a><i>,</i> to which I posted, and continue to post weekly.</p>
<p>But of course, that wasn’t enough. So about a year later I self-published the first book, <i>One With All of Thee: Growing Your Sacred Connection</i> <i>(</i><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/One-All-Thee-Growing-Connection-ebook/dp/B01MCT88Y1/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1489361546&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=one+with+all+of+thee%3A+growing+your+sacred+connection"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>See Volume One here</i></a><i>),</i> a compilation of postings from the blog. To my surprise, rather than being chastised and ridiculed, I was thanked by many for sharing these words. Although they seem so simple, these words are very powerful, and many have been deeply affected by reading them.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, in this sea of global change with the expanding atmosphere of fear. I know it’s time to continue with the next installment of messages. To quote someone who read a draft of <i>Sowing the Seeds for Change (Volume Two)</i>, ‘<i>The first book was like a primer. This one goes much deeper into the process of making changes in your life.</i>’ And that is so very true. Now that they have your attention, my Tovarysh want to get down to business and gently move you forward on your spiritual path.</p>
<p>Having recently retired from a career in medical research, I am also living my life-long dream of being a farmer, with an acre of blueberries that I harvest in mid-summer. Living on my farm, working with Mother Nature, provides opportunities for me every day to see the interconnection between all living things. I work with the fairies as I tend this wonderful piece of land I call home. I have given talks on <i><a href=""https://www.elephantjournal.com/2014/08/loving-my-blueberries-the-spiritual-rules-of-farming-celine-koropchak/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Spiritual Side of Farming</a>,</i> which incorporate so much of what is presented in the written messages of the OWAT series. I’ve been a guest on <a href=""http://www.blogtalkradio.com/lpsradionetwork/2014/06/04/everyday-angels-with-your-host-marie-elisa-celine-koropchakgift-sensitivity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BlogTalkRadio</a> a few times and teach and speak locally, doing what I can to share the words of wisdom entrusted to me. My growth continues in this role of messenger/teacher/spiritual farmer, as I suspect I was destined to do.</p>

I am also anticipating costs for Paypal, Indiegogo processing fees, and perks ($2000).

My Story
My name is Celine Koropchak, and I have been receiving messages for over 25 years from my guides, whom I lovingly refer to as my Tovarysh (pronounced: Toe-Vahsh). Tovarysh is the Slavic word for friends, and these guides have most definitely been my loving friends since I was a child. Even though their messages have always been gentle and loving, for the longest time, I only shared them with my closest friends. I guess I should have known that one day I would be asked to share these words with the world. That request came about four years ago.
Being the private person that I am, my immediate response was, ‘You want me to do what?’ I didn’t know what people would think of me, and besides, how would I even do this? But I could never say no to my Tovarysh, and so I started with a blog, TheTovaryshConnection, to which I posted, and continue to post weekly.
But of course, that wasn’t enough. So about a year later I self-published the first book, One With All of Thee: Growing Your Sacred Connection (See Volume One here), a compilation of postings from the blog. To my surprise, rather than being chastised and ridiculed, I was thanked by many for sharing these words. Although they seem so simple, these words are very powerful, and many have been deeply affected by reading them.
Fast forward to today, in this sea of global change with the expanding atmosphere of fear. I know it’s time to continue with the next installment of messages. To quote someone who read a draft of Sowing the Seeds for Change (Volume Two), ‘The first book was like a primer. This one goes much deeper into the process of making changes in your life.’ And that is so very true. Now that they have your attention, my Tovarysh want to get down to business and gently move you forward on your spiritual path.
Having recently retired from a career in medical research, I am also living my life-long dream of being a farmer, with an acre of blueberries that I harvest in mid-summer.

Something I used to hide away from, and constantly worry that people will judge me for it. I can't do that anymore. I've found a unique, modern way, through writing a fictional story, to help not only myself, but others too. Learn more below, </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What I need is $3600 to finish part 3 in my trilogy All I Need. The money is going towards the typesetting, design, printing and publishing of the book. I'm so close to finishing it and with a little more help, I can do just that! </p>
<p>The costs are as follows:</p>
<p>Typesetting - $2200</p>
<p>Cover- $600</p>
<p>Printing, setup and promotional package - $800</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>When I began the first book in my trilogy ""All I Need"", I was 16 years old. I saw it as a way to release my emotions, talk about my dreams, my fears and so much more. When I was little, I had so many ideas of what I wanted to be. I loved life, people and I was talented in many things like piano, baseball, singing, acting and so on. That was until I hit Junior high, then kids began to tease me about my looks. I didn't understand any of it, and slowly I started to doubt myself in everything. When I was born, my shoulder blades were fused as one, and my neck cords went out to the edge of my shoulders. I guess it made me look like I had no neck to some people, I was also missing a few vertebras from my neck. I knew I was a little different, but I didn't think it stood out that much. I couldn't believe how mean some people could be and I soon realized how badly words can really hurt you. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">After junior high, entering high school was a nightmare. The teasing continued, no matter how much I tried to ignore it. It didn't matter what great things I was doing, and it didn't matter how many friends I had, I could always hear their voices. The mean kids were always there and I started to feel very lonely. As many of you know, high school is hard, maybe the hardest of all for a young kid. I was betrayed by some close friends, including my boyfriend, and my parents got a </span>divorce<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> too.  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I didn't really know how to handle it all, I then began to have nightmares in my sleep and before I knew it, anxiety had suddenly appeared in my life. This went on for quite sometime and I started to pull back from a lot of people. And then something else happened, as weird as it sounds, I had this guy who started to show up in my dreams every night. He would talk to me in simple phrases and help me through horrible situations building in my mind. He was caring, and loving, and I had no idea how I </span>conjured<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> him up. It actually freaked me out very much, believe me, I know how crazy this sounds. :D I had to do something about it, so I did, that mysterious guy soon became the main character in a lot of my stories I was secretly creating, and long after that, he became ""Nathan"" the guardian angel in my trilogy All I Need.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">After </span>high school<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> I moved around a lot, and took on many different jobs, trying to find my place in the world, trying to feel like I belonged, but nothing worked. I still felt lost. That's when I decided to take a bigger leap and go to acting school in Vancouver. It was everything people told me NOT to do, and it made me think about my looks again, did people think I wouldn't make it because of my looks? My past continued to haunt me, but the film/movie world was a dream of mine since I was little. I needed another change, because nothing here was working. My entire 20's were a ball of craziness. I was taking chances thinking I was being brave, trying to figure things out, but I seemed to keep hitting bad luck everywhere I went. When I was about 26, I began to realize that maybe I had a bit of depression, but I was too scared to really admit it and definitely not loud to anyone. I was ashamed for feeling how I did, I felt very unworthy as a person and I soon found it very hard to follow my dreams. I felt like no one understood me. I didn't know it then, but I was ruining things for myself the more I fell into that downward spiral in my mind. Feeling like I had no one to turn to that wouldn't judge me, I began to write my feelings into stories, notes, and songs. And all of that, along with some old work from my high school years, soon became All I Need.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> It was something I created without knowing it, and ultimately, this story ended up producing a powerful voice for myself, I just hadn't used it yet.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The writing made me feel better in the moment I was doing it, but the rest of the time in a 24 hour day, continued to be a battle with my mind and it's horrible thoughts. I hit a point where I wanted to give up, I couldn't see a way out, and I definitely couldn't talk to anyone about it. I was very close to the end. Until one night, I had a dream, and in that dream, that same young man showed up. He showed me visions of 3 books and being somewhere in the film business. I felt like he was showing me a published work that was going to become a film series.... I remember waking up and thinking how crazy that seemed, how impossible that sounded. Plus my </span>grammar<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> was horrible.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">But then after a few days of dragging my feet around... I decided to put the story together as a whole. I tied in my own life experiences and made it very personal, which is why I'm so connected to this series. After reading the first book ""All I Need"", I soon started to learn a lot more about myself, it was </span>almost<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> like my own </span>therapy<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> session. So when I began to write ""Don't Tell Me Goodbye"" the second novel in the trilogy, I began the journey to healing my soul. I had taken a step back and realized that I had done something great, and more importantly I was learning about myself, and through the story, learning how to heal on my own. </span></p>
<p>The story of my main character ""Sophie"", which was loosely based on my life, had connected with many people young and old, in some way or an other. I began to receive emails and messages from people who had gone through something like this, or had a child going through the same thing... and the story became even closer to my heart. I didn't feel so ashamed for my feelings and thoughts anymore. I didn't feel so alone. I then created a web-series based on the first book All I Need and premiered it independently for 275 people. The response was amazing and the story only connected even more with people, and also got many aspiring artist involved. The feedback, even though it was on a smaller scale was motivating to me. I had managed to sneak into the minds of everyone, and raise some awareness through a fictional story that had a lot of heart, my heart. Schools, communities and more were taking notice of this trilogy and what I was trying to do. The arts had become so powerful to me, and I knew how powerful they were to others now too. They could actually heal and connect people.</p>
<p>I soon found myself hosting ""Young Fiction Writers"" groups at libraries, making classroom visits, I was even nominated for Woman of the Year for arts &amp; culture.  With my depression still lingering around as I continued the fight to heal myself, I knew I had to approach everything I did in a positive way, with blind faith, because now, people were really listening.  I studied myself very closely, learned what set me off, who set me off, what I wanted in life, what I didn't want, and so on. I dug very deep to the root of my problems and started to face things. I started to change myself for the better. In my research for the last book in the All I Need trilogy, I learned about an old Japanese treatments called ""Reiki"". This, of everything I did, opened my eyes the most. I didn't believe it at first, but after spending 1 day at Soaring Spirit in Cambridge Ontario, my mind had changed. A deep feeling of calm started to spread throughout my body, and push out a lot of my negative thoughts. It's one of those things you can't quite explain, kind of like the guy in my dreams. I don't think of myself as a very religious or spiritual person, but now I don't know what to believe. There's too much that doesn't make sense... And now I felt sad again, but not in a depressing way. In a way, that I had been wasting my life, when I could've been doing something great, like I was now.</p>
<p>Today, those dark feelings still linger around, and I have moments of lower energy, but for the most part I feel alive again. They have a hard time pushing past all of the good energy I'm now creating. So now I've taken all of that knowledge I've learned along the way, and my love for supernatural love stories, and put all of it into my last book entitled ""You're Not Alone."" Because I feel like you never really are. There will always be someone out there that feels or thinks the way you do, and we all need to listen to that little voice inside of us. The one that loves us the most, the one that makes us feel like we are not alone in life. So I would love for the chance to complete my trilogy and share with the world this heart felt story of love, friendship, dreams and blind faith in life. And I want it to be published and pitched for a possible film or television series. I know this story can be larger then life, and I know it will connect with people who spend everyday, secretly fighting themselves. I just need to get it out there, which is why I'm telling my true story, in hopes that I can connect with others and get some support.   </p>
<p>I need Sophie to have an ending that is exactly what she needs in life. And that's the main point of my story, we all need something different. We each have a fate, things we're good at, special talents and more, but are we really listening to our hearts? Or are we too surrounded by negativity, distractions and people and their ""Me time"" to feel whole anymore? We need to care for each other, open our eyes to our flaws, and be willing to help. I'm hoping this last part of the book will make others take a step back in life for a moment, and truly look into their soul, find out what they love about themselves, and not be afraid to chase after what they want in life. </p>
<p> But I can't do it without a little more help. So if you can, please donate, every little bit helps. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. &lt;3</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary I'm about to get very real here, and share something that I used to be ashamed of. Something I used to hide away from, and constantly worry that people will judge me for it. I can't do that anymore. I've found a unique, modern way, through writing a fictional story, to help not only myself, but others too. Learn more below,    What We Need & What You Get What I need is $3600 to finish part 3 in my trilogy All I Need.

The costs are as follows:
Typesetting - $2200

Printing, setup and promotional package - $800
    The Impact When I began the first book in my trilogy ""All I Need"", I was 16 years old. I saw it as a way to release my emotions, talk about my dreams, my fears and so much more. When I was little, I had so many ideas of what I wanted to be. I loved life, people and I was talented in many things like piano, baseball, singing, acting and so on. That was until I hit Junior high, then kids began to tease me about my looks. I didn't understand any of it, and slowly I started to doubt myself in everything. When I was born, my shoulder blades were fused as one, and my neck cords went out to the edge of my shoulders. I guess it made me look like I had no neck to some people, I was also missing a few vertebras from my neck. I knew I was a little different, but I didn't think it stood out that much. I couldn't believe how mean some people could be and I soon realized how badly words can really hurt you. 
After junior high, entering high school was a nightmare. The teasing continued, no matter how much I tried to ignore it. It didn't matter what great things I was doing, and it didn't matter how many friends I had, I could always hear their voices. The mean kids were always there and I started to feel very lonely. As many of you know, high school is hard, maybe the hardest of all for a young kid. I was betrayed by some close friends, including my boyfriend, and my parents got a divorce too.  I didn't really know how to handle it all, I then began to have nightmares in my sleep and before I knew it, anxiety had suddenly appeared in my life. This went on for quite sometime and I started to pull back from a lot of people. And then something else happened, as weird as it sounds, I had this guy who started to show up in my dreams every night. He would talk to me in simple phrases and help me through horrible situations building in my mind. He was caring, and loving, and I had no idea how I conjured him up. It actually freaked me out very much, believe me, I know how crazy this sounds. :D I had to do something about it, so I did, that mysterious guy soon became the main character in a lot of my stories I was secretly creating, and long after that, he became ""Nathan"" the guardian angel in my trilogy All I Need.
After high school I moved around a lot, and took on many different jobs, trying to find my place in the world, trying to feel like I belonged, but nothing worked. I still felt lost. That's when I decided to take a bigger leap and go to acting school in Vancouver. It was everything people told me NOT to do, and it made me think about my looks again, did people think I wouldn't make it because of my looks? My past continued to haunt me, but the film/movie world was a dream of mine since I was little. I needed another change, because nothing here was working. My entire 20's were a ball of craziness. I was taking chances thinking I was being brave, trying to figure things out, but I seemed to keep hitting bad luck everywhere I went. When I was about 26, I began to realize that maybe I had a bit of depression, but I was too scared to really admit it and definitely not loud to anyone. I was ashamed for feeling how I did, I felt very unworthy as a person and I soon found it very hard to follow my dreams. I felt like no one understood me. I didn't know it then, but I was ruining things for myself the more I fell into that downward spiral in my mind. Feeling like I had no one to turn to that wouldn't judge me, I began to write my feelings into stories, notes, and songs. And all of that, along with some old work from my high school years, soon became All I Need. It was something I created without knowing it, and ultimately, this story ended up producing a powerful voice for myself, I just hadn't used it yet.
The writing made me feel better in the moment I was doing it, but the rest of the time in a 24 hour day, continued to be a battle with my mind and it's horrible thoughts. I hit a point where I wanted to give up, I couldn't see a way out, and I definitely couldn't talk to anyone about it. I was very close to the end. Until one night, I had a dream, and in that dream, that same young man showed up. He showed me visions of 3 books and being somewhere in the film business. I felt like he was showing me a published work that was going to become a film series.... I remember waking up and thinking how crazy that seemed, how impossible that sounded. Plus my grammar was horrible.
But then after a few days of dragging my feet around... I decided to put the story together as a whole. I tied in my own life experiences and made it very personal, which is why I'm so connected to this series. After reading the first book ""All I Need"", I soon started to learn a lot more about myself, it was almost like my own therapy session. So when I began to write ""Don't Tell Me Goodbye"" the second novel in the trilogy, I began the journey to healing my soul. I had taken a step back and realized that I had done something great, and more importantly I was learning about myself, and through the story, learning how to heal on my own. 
The story of my main character ""Sophie"", which was loosely based on my life, had connected with many people young and old, in some way or an other. I began to receive emails and messages from people who had gone through something like this, or had a child going through the same thing... and the story became even closer to my heart. I didn't feel so ashamed for my feelings and thoughts anymore. I didn't feel so alone. I then created a web-series based on the first book All I Need and premiered it independently for 275 people. The response was amazing and the story only connected even more with people, and also got many aspiring artist involved. The feedback, even though it was on a smaller scale was motivating to me. I had managed to sneak into the minds of everyone, and raise some awareness through a fictional story that had a lot of heart, my heart. Schools, communities and more were taking notice of this trilogy and what I was trying to do. The arts had become so powerful to me, and I knew how powerful they were to others now too. They could actually heal and connect people.
I soon found myself hosting ""Young Fiction Writers"" groups at libraries, making classroom visits, I was even nominated for Woman of the Year for arts & culture.  With my depression still lingering around as I continued the fight to heal myself, I knew I had to approach everything I did in a positive way, with blind faith, because now, people were really listening.  I studied myself very closely, learned what set me off, who set me off, what I wanted in life, what I didn't want, and so on.

Do you know a young person who is struggling to find their path? It seems like that’s the norm for most Millennials. The reality is Millennials are not really set up to succeed in society.We at Millennial Skills are here to change that.The world is changing so quickly and our schools and education haven’t been able to keep up… We’ve been able to help Millennials have a life filled with more success and more meaning.  We’ve been able to help them combine their career and their purpose in life so that they can start making a positive impact in their own lives and the lives of those around them. With tuition rates and student loans rising, it’s important for young people to start focusing on their passion and career so they do not find themselves in a bad economic position. According to Johnson and Wales, companies need Millennials to: 
Communicate well 
Stay organized 
Interact well with other people 
Critical think and problem solve 
Lead other people 
But that doesn’t appear to be the typical Millennial... The biggest stereotype about Millennials? They’re lazy and entitled… But I think we just weren’t taught the strategies to find our path in this new world.  Millennial Skills was created to help budding professionals like ourselves do just that. After coaching thousands of Millennials who were entering the real world. We learned that they dream of success, but they just don’t have the skills or the support to make it a reality. Millennial Skills provides the confidence and the community for young people to develop the skills they need to succeed. Our number one mission is to help young people find their path and their purpose for their life.We help them identify their strengths, passions, and experiences to create a career path that energizes them Productivity and focus are some of the main pain points that plague young people and keep them stuck on the couchWe help them to improve their efficiency and effectiveness by improving their organization and planning skillsMoney isn’t everything, but it is an important survival tool in this age.We help young people build the skills necessary excel financially.We focus on growing their income, increasing their savings, and building their long-term wealthWe want our young people to live life full of enthusiasm and energy. That requires taking care of our health.We help our young people to eat, sleep, and exercise with more intention. They say you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. That being said we want our young people to create thriving relationships in their lifeWe help our community to surround themselves with mentors and quality peers.
Time tested strategies and tactics to help accelerate your career and personal success and help you start living the life you’re capable of 
Support of 500+ like-minded, motivated Millennials in our Facebook Community to keep you on tract 
Audio and Video Companions to the text to help implement and understand the material easier 
Worksheets and exercises to help retain and remember the information quicker 
Easy to read text that can be read from start to finish or in bite-sized pieces. 
Here’s an opportunity to help young people find their path and their purpose in life. You can create a positive change in a young person and in our future.  We have all seen glimmers of potential within our generation and we can make a positive impact on the world by improving the Millennial generation’s awareness and compassion for others.  Millennial Skills will be the catalyst to improve every other area of life. It’s time to support our community. Support our generation And support YOUR future….  He’s spent almost the last decade in sales and entrepreneurship, trained thousands of Millennials, created millions in revenue and now wants to help other people achieve the same. A note from Hector: I’m so excited you’re interested in helping our community. I learned the hard way that I can’t do it all, and I need people like you to help me change the world for the better. I’ve experienced the blessings of so many people and now want to share the gifts I was given with the world. My life changed after I read 50 books in 2014. I decided to finally commit to passion in life. lose a ton of weight and finally move out of my parents. It was a long journey that taught me so many lessons. I learned them the hard way and I want to make that route and a path easier for the people who come after me. BONUSES:

<strong>Happy to Be Sharing This Journey With</strong> <strong>You!</strong>
</h2>
<p>Two years ago I started writing about my journey with autism at Gothic Writers' Workshop, followed by five workshops with Ms. Vanessa Martir at Hunter College. I started writing as therapy to try and mend my broken heart upon my son's autism diagnosis. I realized though, that the more I attended these workshops, the more my desire to become a writer grew. As much as I saw it as an impossibility, I kept going back for more. I was intimidated by the level of eduacation most of the students had reached, and struggled with believing that I could do it too. For the past two years I only dreamed about one day attending VONA, but this year was the first time I set my very first goal. My goal... to finally let go of the fear of writing that which has held me a prisoner. That which has led me to lead a depressed life. TO FINALLY WRITE THROUGH THE FEAR AND APPLY TO VONA! I would be so humbled and eternally grateful if you could join me on this journey ;)</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2><strong>It's Only a Dream..</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Only as a child did I dream of writing a book, and never did I imagine that I'd be preparing for my journey to become a published writer of memoir and personal narrative. For sure I never thought I'd be writng about <em>my</em> life though. Growing up I began to keep a diary since the age of 6. I had the Hello Kitty diary with a lock of course. I couldn't risk my brothers reading my personal stuff and telling my mom. Thinking back at the stuff I used to write, I always <em>only </em>wrote about <em>my life. </em>I wrote about the things that made me happy, the things that made me scared, the things I wished for, about one day having a sister because I so desperately needed a companion, someone to talk to. But mostly about the things that made me very sad. I guess I've been destined to write about my life and I didn't even know this until now that I write this.</p>
<p>When I applied to VONA I was scared, nervous, emotional, in ectasy. I was fighting to believe that I could do this. To believe that I was worthy of being accepted. I fought through the emotional journey the writing of the personal narrative I submitted put me through. That same reason why I could never complete this narrative, was the same reason why I needed to finally dig and fight through. I didn't feel like a writer worthy of being given this opportunity, let alone the title of a WRITER. And as much as I wanted to believe I wasn't going to get in, I knew in my heart in the most profound way, that I was getting in. I was calm and without worries for the month it took to hear from VONA, until 2 days before receiving my acceptance letter. On FB, I saw the amount of people from all over the world that had applied. I knew the competition was fierce, and I began to doubt myself. Upon receiving the letter of acceptance, I realized then for the first time that I am worthy.</p>
<h2><strong>VONA!</strong></h2>
<p>Thank you so much to all who took the time to read my narrative and give me your valuable critiques. To those that follow my FaceBook posts and truly enjoy my writing. Please know that you guys are the reason why I finally decided to make my Blog public. I fed off of your comments. Your request to read more of myself. But most importantly, how I made you feel. The reflections of your own life. The comments telling me how much something I wrote helped you. I will be sharing my journey with you all via my personal blog at carmeninguanzo.tumblr.com. There you will also find my 2nd blog dedicate to my son, Evan. </p>
<p>The cost of VONA is $1350 and it includes room and board, all meals and the workshop. I does not however, include airfare and transportation. I won't say it will be easy to come up with all of the money, but I am asking for help in raising $1200. I know times are hard these days so please don't think that a donation as small as $5, $10, $15 or $20 is too little. Any amount will definitely help me reach my goal. I trust that I will meet it, only because I am someone that strongly believes in paying it forward! I would also extremely appreciate if you could kindly share my campaign on your page as well. This would be another way to help. Especially if you cannot make a donation.</p>
<h2>THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!</h2>
<p>I want to thank everyone in advance just for taking the time to read my campaign in its entirety. I am extremely grateful to all of you for believing in me. For giving me the strength to do this and to fall in love with this art more and more each passing day. I am humbled. I am excited to embark on this journey. I am thrilled to be sharing it with you every step of the way! <strong>I DID IT GUYS ;)</strong></p>

<p>Hi, my name is Perie Wolford and I'm a gay author based in Russia. Being a member of LGBT community in Russia is challenging, but thanks to such worldwide platforms like Amazon KDP it has become possible for me to express myself through books and stories that I hope might help others like me.</p>
<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>A good book in the end of a bad day can really make a difference to a kid who is suffering through bullying and oppression from his peers. It happened to me, and hopeful LGBT books like <i>Brent Hartinger's</i> <strong>Geography Club</strong> (<i>which later was turned into Geography Club movie</i>) have helped me lessen my depression at the time and struggle through teen years with hope and pride. It was a struggle nonetheless but I felt empowered; I felt like I wasn't alone; I felt like I belonged.</p>
<p><i>On a side note, I was very honored to have Brent Hartinger read my book and give a positive review. He thought it had a similar message of hope he had imprinted in his own book 10 years earlier.</i></p>

<p>Later in life, in my late twenties, I got the idea to write a book like that, hopeful and encouraging. My screenwriting skills helped me draft a book based on a movie that I hold very dear to my heart: <i>John Hughes'</i>  <strong>Sixteen Candles</strong>. It's an 80es classic and an example of a perfectly sweet positivity-driven plots that were popular at the time. I replicated some of the elements from the movie in my book, making it nonetheless original and hopefully bringing something new to the table. Samantha from the movie was turned into Sam in my book, a struggling gay teen. And although his struggles are silly, unlike in real life, the message of hope is still there. It does get better if you find the right path and follow it.</p>
<p>After the book's been published in 2014, it was warmly received and kids constantly reached out to me saying it helped them through the day. That's the best praise an author can get, knowing you helped someone, even tangentially, through the power of writing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>The book has gathered a bit of attention back in 2014. But the past couple of years the market has been oversaturated with self-publishing new authors. It's become much more difficult to stand out and get noticed. I wish I could afford high-priced promotions, but the truth is, $500 is my monthly paycheck in Russia. I have a dayjob aside from writing, since writing doesn't get me a lot of money. That's why I thought I might ask people who care about the cause help me raise the money.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> ""In Between The Rhymes"" is part autobiography, part spoken word version of Jay-Z's ""Decoded"". There are quite a few things that have been hidden in plain sight in my poems, and it's time to break them down and bring what's in the dark to the light.</p>
<p>Off the heels of ""LTV2: The Death &amp; Rebirth of Christopher Owens"", which was nominated for Spoken Word Album of the Year, I've decided to start on this project. But anyone that knows me knows I don't do ""normal"". I was told not to be a full time spoken word artist, I was told a spoken word album couldn't get nationwide recognition...and now I'm being told by some I shouldn't write a book. Let's show them otherwise.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Simply put: I need money to get this book published. I'm not talking about ""Look, Mom... I've put some pages together!"" I want this to be a professional quality book that you'll be able to pick up at your Barnes &amp; Noble or put on your iPad. To put the book into those formats won't take a lot, but any help I can get would definitely be appreciated! Those who help will be among those who are able to receive the book long before it's released as a token of my gratitude.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Reading is more than fundamental; it is ESSENTIAL. Spoken Word has sparked a revitalization of an appreciation of the arts with our youth. Furthermore, this book discusses the up, downs, mistakes &amp; lessons I've learned throughout my life. It is my belief that telling my experiences will allow others to avoid my mistakes and also empower others to follow their dreams.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Shadows and Reflections: A tribute to Roger Zelazny<br/>Edited by Trent Zelazny and Warren Lapine<br/><br/>Shadows and Reflections is a tribute to the fiction of Roger Zelazny. We are looking for stories set in any of the various universes that Zelazny created in his short stories and novels, with the exception of the Amber universe. As you probably know, Zelazny’s work covered a very wide range of genre fiction so we are open to most genres. The only limiting factor is that a story must either use one or more of Zelazny’s characters or be expressly set in one of his milieus. Zelazny was one of the most literate and inventive writers that genre fiction has ever known. Your Story submission should reflect that.<br/>Length: up to 10,000 words.<br/>Payment: 5 cents per word for unsolicited stories max $250.00 and 10 cents per word for solicited stories max $500.00 on acceptance. (Note unsolicited subs are contingent upon our hitting our primary Indiegogo goal and may increase to the same amount as the solicited stories if we hit our secondary Indiegogo goal.<br/>Submissions: Stories should be e-mailed to <a href=""mailto:shadowsandreflectionsanthology@yahoo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">shadowsandreflectionsanthology@yahoo.com</a></p>
<p> </p>

Both Trent and Warren really wanted to let other, lesser known writers who were influenced by Roger participate as well as fans who aren’t writers. That desire lead to this Indiegogo campaign. If we reach our primary goal of $10,000.00 we will open the anthology up to unsolicited submissions. If we reach our secondary goal of $15,000.00 we will pay the unsolicited writers the same rate that we are paying for solicited stories. If we hit our third goal of $20,000.00 the anthology will come out not just in trade paper back and as an e-book, but also in hard cover. So please join us and help celibrate the memory of Roger Zelazny and all the amazing universes he created and get some cool perks.</p>

Shadows and Reflections: A tribute to Roger ZelaznyEdited by Trent Zelazny and Warren LapineShadows and Reflections is a tribute to the fiction of Roger Zelazny. We are looking for stories set in any of the various universes that Zelazny created in his short stories and novels, with the exception of the Amber universe. As you probably know, Zelazny’s work covered a very wide range of genre fiction so we are open to most genres. The only limiting factor is that a story must either use one or more of Zelazny’s characters or be expressly set in one of his milieus. Zelazny was one of the most literate and inventive writers that genre fiction has ever known. Your Story submission should reflect that.Length: up to 10,000 words.Payment: 5 cents per word for unsolicited stories max $250.00 and 10 cents per word for solicited stories max $500.00 on acceptance. (Note unsolicited subs are contingent upon our hitting our primary Indiegogo goal and may increase to the same amount as the solicited stories if we hit our secondary Indiegogo goal.Submissions: Stories should be e-mailed to shadowsandreflectionsanthology@yahoo.com

<h3>Was ist die Encyclopaedia Almanica?</h3>

<p>Ferraeterin, Hrmpfm, Ayesha Khan, Bahar Sheikh, Hengameh Yaghoobifarah und Zugezogenovic verschaffen sich auf Twitter Gehör und manchmal liest es sich, als würden sie twittern, weil sie sonst nicht so frei und offen über bestimmte Themen sprechen können. Als schrieben sie nicht um des Schreibens Willen, sondern um Gedanken abzuschütteln. Humor, Traurigkeit und scharfe Analysen politischer Verhältnisse stehen dicht an dicht.

<h3>Wieso dieses Buch?</h3>
<p>Twitter sperrt regelmäßig die Accounts von Schwarzen Menschen und Menschen of Colour. Nazis und Menschen, die es nicht so gut meinen mit BIPoCs (Black, Indigenous and People of Colour) sind im Netz sehr gut organisiert und allein eine hohe Anzahl von Meldungen kann zu der Sperrung eines Kontos führen. Das ist natürlich insbesondere für BIPoCs fatal, da ihre Stimmen in der Gesellschaft sowieso kaum Gehör finden. Durch die Sperrungen der Accounts sind wertvolle Inhalte verloren gegangen, die wir in der Enzyklopädie wieder einfangen und archivieren. Alle Accounts sind der Herausgeberin durch ihren Witz, ihre Klugheit und ihren Scharfsinn aufgefallen. Die Encyclopaedia Almanica soll unterhalten, zum Nachdenken und Austausch anregen.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, it seemed impossible to escape Satan’s
supposed influence. Everywhere you turned, there were warnings about a
widespread evil conspiracy to indoctrinate the vulnerable through the media
they consumed. This percolating cultural hysteria, now known as the “Satanic
Panic,” not only sought to convince us of devils lurking behind the dials of
our TVs and radios and the hellfire that awaited on book and video store
shelves, it also created its own fascinating cultural legacy of Satan-battling
VHS tapes, audio cassettes and literature. The second book by Canadian
micro-publisher <a href=""http://www.spectacularoptical.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spectacular Optical</a>, <i><b>Satanic
Panic: Pop-Cultural Paranoia in the 1980s</b>, </i>offers an unprecedented and
in-depth exploration of how a controversial culture war played out during the
decade, from the publication of the memoir <i>Michelle Remembers</i> in 1980 to
the end of the McMartin “Satanic Ritual Abuse” Trial in 1990. This new
anthology, expected to be released in summer 2015, follows on the success of <b><i></i></b><a href=""http://www.spectacularoptical.ca/store/product/spectacular-optical-book-one-kid-power/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KID POWER!,</a> Spectacular Optical’s
inaugural book about cool, tough and sassy kids in cult film and television. </p>
<p><i><b>Satanic Panic:
Pop-Cultural Paranoia in the 1980s</b> </i>features new essays and interviews by 20
emerging and established writers who address the ways the widespread fear of a
Satanic conspiracy was both illuminated and propagated through almost every pop
culture pathway in the 1980s, from heavy metal music to Dungeons &amp; Dragons
role playing games, Christian comics, direct-to-VHS scare films, pulp paperbacks,
Saturday morning cartoons, TV talk shows and even home computers. The book also
features case studies on McMartin, Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth and Long Island
“acid king” killer Ricky Kasso. From con artists to pranksters and moralists to
martyrs, the book aims to capture the untold story of the how the Satanic Panic
was fought on the pop culture frontlines and the serious consequences it had
for many involved.</p>

Now don't get me wrong, they were terrible at first. But they got better. I wrote more and fleshed out ideas and motivations. It grew. I grew. 
Five years later, my novel is ready for print. 
With dozens of beta readers, fervent fans, and dedicated friends, I am presenting today a chance to give light to my novel. 
   What We Need & What You Get I decided to self-publish my vampire mystery novel in order to keep its design -- a three part story in one book. Although I love a good series, I wanted readers to be able to get the whole story in one go. 
By contributing today, you are helping pay for formatting and printing costs using a local Boise publisher. By going local, I need to buy a minimum number of books, but it also means that I get hands on dedication and excellent quality.
My book is already written, already edited. I have an amazing village of people helping me, and now we want to put it all together. After this campaign ends, I will give my precious manuscript to John, my printer. It will take about a week to format it, and about a week to print, then all books will be mailed out shortly after. I anticipate mid-July. 
And what is a book release without a badass party? Your contributions also help with that. I have an amazing marketing director who knows exactly how to get proper exposure. I want to be interviewed by Ellen DeGeneres, so I need all the exposure I can get! 
Of course, for helping make my work come to life, you get the best prizes: signed books, e-books, vampire paraphernalia, tickets to the release party. Check out the options!
    

    Other Ways You Can Help Do you know how many awesome projects there are in the world? Millions. And I wish we could fund them all. That's okay! Because there are still ways that you can help.
Would you mind sharing this link on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/Pinterest/Tinder? I don't care! Helping get the word out is half the battle. 
Also, you can email me if you have party hookups. Caterers? Live music? Want to make me a cute new dress? Want to make sure my dog can go to the party and you're willing to be his chaperone? I know all y'all are creative out there! Let's make this campaign bigger than Exploding Kittens! (Is it taboo to mention another funding site's super successful campaign?)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><em><strong> NO</strong> </em>we aren't two crazy ladies, well maybe just a little crazy.  But we are trying to educate, support and raise awareness about the wonderful world of cloth pads. Helping ladies with their leaks top to bottom!</p>
<p>Robyn started Posh Pads back in 2008, after her grandmother, aunt and mother-in-law were diagnosed with breast cancer.  Her small home-based business started on <strong>ETSY</strong>, selling her organic bamboo nursing pads.  With the help of her friend and now business partner Evelyn they have a product line that includes many other breastfeeding accessories and NOW they have expanded their line to include It's A Girl Thing <em><strong>PERIOD</strong></em> washable cloth menstrual pads and panty liners.</p>
<p>Knowing that disposable pads and tampons are made using many harmful chemicals that can cause irritation, as well as other health related problems, they are helping women make the switch to a healthy choice in feminine products.  Adding to the harmful chemicals to girls and womens bodies is the 20 billion pads and tampons that are either flushed into our water systems or dumped into our landfills.  The amount of waste this causes is enormous.  In one womans lifetime they will use more than 11,000 tampons or pads.</p>
<p><em><strong>Our vision is to help others make an informed choice in switching to cloth, encourage them to try them and help clear our minds of the fear that cloth is something gross, hard to care for or not worth the trouble.  We know it’s not for everyone, although who ever thought sticking a tampon up our woohoo was such a wonderful idea in the beginning.  We have to retrain our minds and for the young girls start them on the path with cloth.  I really feel like that is where change will have it’s impact.  If we as mothers help our daughters start out with cloth, they wont fear the cloth, but feel empowered by knowledge to understand how easy it is to use.</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Shadow Rabbit </em>is a story about talking animals written for adults. Katy, a rabbit with a deformed and haunted eye, must master the power of her curse to save the world when an undead horror seeks to plunge reality into eternal nightmare.</p>
<p>To accomplish her goal, Katy must travel across mystic realms, master dream magic, and uncover the dark secret of her own sinister origin. Murder, lies, and conspiracies among both humans and animals force Katy to question who she can afford to trust or love. The temptation to use her new power to punish humanity and its allies grows with each injustice she discovers. This is a book for grown ups with elements of horror, science fiction, and fairy tales thrown into the mix.</p>

<h1>Who is this book for?</h1>
<p><em>Shadow Rabbit </em>has broad appeal for adults who enjoy fantasy, fables, horror, and science fiction. It is also for anyone that loves animals, or who is fascinated by the power of dreams and myth. Though there is much beauty in the world of <em>Shadow Rabbit</em>, there are dark and graphic elements which make this story inappropriate for children.<br/><br/><em>Shadow Rabbit </em>was once described as <em>The Talisman</em> meets <em>Watership Down</em>. I took this as a great compliment.</p>

<h2><strong>Who is writing Shadow Rabbit?</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Walt Batycki. I'm a graduate of the California Institute of the Arts film school, I majored in story development and animation, and later graduated from the UCLA professional screenwriting program. I worked for several years in the entertainment industry in character animation, designing theme park attractions, screenwriting, TV series production, and video game design.  My former employers include Walt Disney Imagineering, Rough Draft Studios, Dreamworks, and Electronic Arts.  <br/><br/>I left behind steady creative work to spend several intense years working in animal rescue and rehabilitation at one of the nation's leading farm animal rescues.

</div></div>","SYNOPSIS
Shadow Rabbit is a story about talking animals written for adults. Katy, a rabbit with a deformed and haunted eye, must master the power of her curse to save the world when an undead horror seeks to plunge reality into eternal nightmare.
To accomplish her goal, Katy must travel across mystic realms, master dream magic, and uncover the dark secret of her own sinister origin. Murder, lies, and conspiracies among both humans and animals force Katy to question who she can afford to trust or love. The temptation to use her new power to punish humanity and its allies grows with each injustice she discovers. This is a book for grown ups with elements of horror, science fiction, and fairy tales thrown into the mix.

Who is this book for?
Shadow Rabbit has broad appeal for adults who enjoy fantasy, fables, horror, and science fiction. It is also for anyone that loves animals, or who is fascinated by the power of dreams and myth. Though there is much beauty in the world of Shadow Rabbit, there are dark and graphic elements which make this story inappropriate for children.Shadow Rabbit was once described as The Talisman meets Watership Down. I took this as a great compliment.

Who is writing Shadow Rabbit?
My name is Walt Batycki. I'm a graduate of the California Institute of the Arts film school, I majored in story development and animation, and later graduated from the UCLA professional screenwriting program. I worked for several years in the entertainment industry in character animation, designing theme park attractions, screenwriting, TV series production, and video game design.  My former employers include Walt Disney Imagineering, Rough Draft Studios, Dreamworks, and Electronic Arts.  I left behind steady creative work to spend several intense years working in animal rescue and rehabilitation at one of the nation's leading farm animal rescues. During my non-profit years I managed barn staff, and became the facilities Animal Health Care Director, working with veterinarians and often fostering special needs animals in my own home.  During that hectic time on the farm, a story that had been brewing in my imagination for years began to finally gel and become Shadow Rabbit.

Why this book is important.
In addition to Shadow Rabbit being a fun and frightening tale that I hope will entertain, I am also hoping it will open up minds and hearts in regard to showing more compassion to our fellow Earthlings of every species. Though the story is a fantasy, all-too-real elements of animal cruelty are explored. I am hoping that readers will be moved to consider how their own lifestyles affect countless living creatures across the globe, and explore many deep questions by considering each non-human life on a personal level. I don't see much in the way of fiction written for adults doing that lately.I feel that my unique background makes me the perfect hybrid of author, artist, and advocate to tell this particular story.

<br/></p><h3>Executive Summary (tl;dr):</h3>
<p>In a world where a championship puzzle-maker without job or car tries to make ends meet, he offers the world a puzzle book series revealing <em>every secret trick he knows</em> to solve them, and this is the first book in that series, based on one of the most popular pure-logic competition puzzle types - the loop puzzle. Don't know what those are? NO PROBLEM! I'll walk you through every step of the way, giving you the knowledge to join the masters. Already a master? NO PROBLEM! With at least 100 <em>hand-crafted</em>, learning-focused puzzles, you'll have plenty of practice! Book will be provided as a .PDF file only. Perks include a sampler of other puzzle types, puzzle commissions, and the first-ever STRETCH PERK - each one makes the book bigger!</p>
<hr/><h3>Who? What? Why?</h3><p>My name is Adam R. Wood, and I am a puzzlesmith. You may know me by my handle - The Zotmeister - and actually know me primarily as a gamer, specifically <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2794419/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">one that doesn't drink, smoke, or do drugs</a>, or perhaps you've encountered my character in <a href=""http://www.team2bit.com/fpcredits.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">that one indie game</a> or <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamesalute/pixel-lincoln-the-deckbuilding-game-0/comments?cursor=895925"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">that one card game</a>,  but I am just as passionate and active in the puzzle community as I am in the gaming community, if not even more so. Nine years ago, I pioneered <a href=""http://zotmeister.dreamwidth.org/?tag=puzzles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the online puzzle journal</a>, spawning numerous <strike>imitators</strike> homages, and I've contributed to <a href=""http://wpc.puzzles.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the national championships</a> for the last seven years.</p><p>In all that time, I've never made an actual puzzle <em>book</em>. The opportunity never arose. With your help, that changes now. However, this is not the typical ""here's a bunch of puzzles, now give me my money"" sort of book I see all too often. Over the years, I've built quite the mental toolbox of techniques and tricks for crafting and solving all sorts of logic-based puzzles, and I won't be content simply spitting out stumpers and sitting back. I want to make the sort of puzzle book that is perhaps rarest of all: the sort that actually <em>teaches</em> how to solve puzzles.</p><p>Hence, the <em>Puzzle Primer Series</em>. With each volume dedicated to all the ins-and-outs of a specific genre, you'll get an unprecedented insider's view of what makes puzzles tick. If you're an absolute beginner, perhaps fascinated by them but have no idea how to begin to approach them, I'll walk you through it step by step. If you're a competitive tournament solver, my puzzles will offer detailed practice for specific situations, and my techniques may streamline your process and reduce your times. If you're anywhere in between, you'll have a lot of fun, you'll hopefully learn some neat things, and by the end you should be ready for whatever's out there.</p><p>Oh, and did I mention <strong>every single puzzle it contains will be composed <i>by hand</i></strong><i>?</i><em> </em>Because they totally will be. There's little art in computer-generated puzzles, and besides, I'll be tailoring each and every puzzle in this book to be as instructive as possible. A well-designed puzzle <em>speaks</em> to the solver; my intent is to make what they say crystal clear, each one adding to the foundation for future puzzles.</p><p>For this first volume, I'm tackling what is by far the most popular style of puzzle from my journal: the loop puzzle. I was <a href=""http://zotmeister.livejournal.com/2005/03/15/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the first to unify the genre</a>, so I'm uniquely qualified to explore in detail the inner workings of not just <em>Slitherlink</em> but also <em>Masyu</em>, <em>Yajilin</em> and other loop-puzzle types, and especially how they can interact in hybrid puzzles - something rarely seen outside of competitions, but that will definitely be covered in my book!</p>
<h3>What's a loop puzzle? What's <em>Slitherlink</em>?</h3><p>Remember doing connect-the-dots when you were a kid? Loop puzzles are the logic-based puzzle version of that. There's (usually) no discernible figure in the result [and let's face it, you probably knew you were drawing an elephant or somesuch all along], but other than that, the principle is pretty similar: you have an array of dots - usually in a nice, neat grid here - and are given clues regarding how they are to be connected into a single closed loop. These dots aren't numbered - in fact, most loop puzzles don't actually use every dot in their loop. Figuring out which dots to use, and how, is all part of the puzzle. Here's a sample before-and-after (the book will have MUCH better graphics):<br/></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/zotmeister/4919919/3678/3678_original.png"" src="""" style=""""/><p><em>Slitherlink</em>, specifically, is the most popular and by far the most common style of loop puzzle: all the clues are numbers inside the cells (between the dots) of the grid. Even though those digits are limited to just '0', '1', '2', and '3', the depth of the logic in <em>Slitherlink</em> puzzles can be astounding. Other styles of loop puzzles can involve gaps in the grid (sometimes with larger numbers in them!) and/or special types of dots that must be used, often in specific ways. No matter what's thrown at you, however, there's always only one way that a single loop can be formed that adheres to all the clues. Knowing how the clues interact with each other is typically the main means of solving, but the very nature of a loop itself is often key!</p><h3>What's going to be in this book?</h3><p>Let me say this straight away: this is not going to be <em>just</em> a collection of puzzles. There will be text. This will be an actual <em>book</em>. Don't worry, though - it won't read like a textbook. It will be informal while still being thorough, getting through just enough exposition to get you from one puzzle to the next. For the curious, there will also be information about the history of the puzzles, some math facts regarding the puzzles, and other trivia.</p><p>The meat-and-potatoes of the book, however, is of course the puzzles themselves. They will lead you through the entire process of mastery, starting with puzzles based on basic loop logic, then introducing more complex clue types - and hidden patterns within them! - one at a time. The accompanying text and diagrams - like the one below - will point out what to look for, clearly defining all sorts of solving elements: short circuits, corners, power towers, parity breaks, and those pesky entry-and-exit rules, to name a few. As you solve, you'll eventually find yourself automatically thinking things like ""can't bounce off that dented two"" and ""that trick never works"" and before you realize it, you'll be an expert.</p><p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/zotmeister/4919919/40729/40729_original.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>There's absolutely <em>no way</em> anything less than <strong>a hundred puzzles</strong> will suffice for this book. <em>Slitherlink</em> alone is deep enough to cover half that! I will be alternating between <em>Slitherlink</em> and other styles of loop puzzles so as to keep the difficulty curve smooth throughout the book. At the end will be <strong>hybrid puzzles</strong>, putting everything you'll have learned together - along with some final techniques the hybridization itself brings to bear! - into a unified challenge. When you're done, you'll know everything I know about loop puzzles, and hopefully will find it to be the most satisfying puzzle book you've ever worked through.</p><h3>
<strong>What is this book going to <em>be</em>, exactly?</strong><br/>
</h3><p>Okay, so here's the deal: I agree that there's no substitute for having a printed puzzle book in your hands, pushing a pencil across the page... but I can't help but feel that such would be getting ahead of myself. As I'm typing this pitch, I really have no clue what the market for an uncommon book like this really is, beyond a core group that have been aching for something like this for, like, ages. So that's why I'm taking this in phases - planning multiple volumes, working on one at a time, and cutting out as many middlemen as feasible in the meantime. Hopefully, somewhere down the line, these will be sufficiently popular that getting a publisher for a traditional physical book can be made to happen, or at least I could try crowdfunding such a thing with much less risk. But for now, <strong>the book will be created as, and provided as, purely a .PDF document</strong>.<br/></p><p>Think about that for a moment, though. No shipping! As soon as it's done, it's in your inbox, with no further hassle at my end or tension at yours. If there are any errors discovered in the book - if you know my puzzle pedigree, you'll know this is <em>extremely</em> unlikely, but if it somehow happens anyway - I can fix them and have an updated version sent to you promptly. And it saves paper! You'll likely only want to print the puzzles themselves, not the textual portions - and the book will be formatted to facilitate this - so that'll be fewer trees pulped and ink sprayed. Or perhaps you have a smartphone that can read .PDF files as an ebook [N.B.: you're on your own for this, I can't even begin to offer smartphone support].</p><p>The best part of this, though, is the simple fact that you'll get the book in your possession without paying anyone other than me: your funds will go directly to supporting me and making this book the best I can for what I raise.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the book will have <strong>at least one hundred loop puzzles</strong>; each will be at least a ten-by-ten grid (eleven-by-eleven counting the dots). Some may be larger out of need or as a stretch perk [see below for details on that little innovation!]; the overall puzzle count can increase with stretch goals, but rest assured I've given myself plenty of time to meet my deadline even if we find this campaign rolling in dough.</p><h3>What's in it for me?</h3><h2>THE PERKS</h2><h4>SHOW ME THE FORTY</h4><p>A little backstory: on my thirtieth birthday, I gave my journal followers a gift - a whopper of a hybrid loop puzzle over a 29-by-29 grid (30-by-30 going by the dots rather than the cells). It's <a href=""http://zotmeister.livejournal.com/15157.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> if you want to see it, but it's not for the faint of heart (you may want to finish my book first!). It proved very popular (and inspirational for some), so I made a 35-dot-by-35-dot followup... six years later. Yes, a year late, but that's something I intend to make up for. On Earth Day, 2015, I'll put on my journal a 40-dot-by-40-dot behemoth... a year early.</p><p>But pledge me a lowly dollar and I'll show it to you <em>a full year earlier than that! </em>If you want to support my project but either have little to spare [trust me, I know the feeling] or figure I can't possibly teach you anything you don't already know about loop puzzles (and that may even be true for some of you, but not many) and just want something truly staggering to tackle, then this humble (if large) option is for you.</p><p>This perk will be delivered to its backers on Earth Day, 2014, regardless of any other perks they may have coming.</p><h4>FRESH DOZEN</h4><p>Don't like loop puzzles? I have an option for that as well: how does a sampler of a dozen of my original puzzle types sound? Yes? Pretty? Hm? Two each of <a href=""http://zotmeister.dreamwidth.org/tag/oasis"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>Island Oases</em></a> (note the plural, it's new and improved!), <a href=""http://zotmeister.dreamwidth.org/tag/rooked"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>Totally Rooked</em></a>, <a href=""http://zotmeister.dreamwidth.org/tag/smullyan"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>Smullyanic Dynasty</em></a>, <em>Pokerum</em> (a simplified <a href=""http://zotmeister.dreamwidth.org/tag/breaker"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>Heartbreaker</em></a>), <em>Astral Wayfarer</em> (I just renamed <a href=""http://zotmeister.dreamwidth.org/tag/syren"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>Seeking Syren</em></a>), and some <em>Sudoku</em> variant I'm keeping secret for now... All puzzles will have grids of size 10-by-10 or larger. Yes, even the <em>Sudoku</em>. These puzzles will <em>only be available to backers</em> for at least a year - they will never be put on my journal or any other website before then, and they won't be any cheaper than the three bucks I'm asking for them now. Pinky swear. </p><p>This perk will be delivered to its backers by the end of April, 2014, regardless of any other perks they may have coming. This is a month before the book is due, so if you'd like to add this in with a book order, it'll give you something to whet your appetite. In fact, I'll sweeten that deal even further: get the book and the sampler, and I'll show you the forty for free! The option you're looking for up there on the right for this is ""ALL THE PUZZLES"".</p><h4>LUCKY THIRTEEN</h4><p>Two, two, two perks in one! Thirteen puzzles, four dollars. Not sure why anyone wouldn't just add a buck and get the book proper, but I'm nothing if not thorough.</p><h4>THE BOOK</h4><p>Why we're here! I can't help but feel I'm offering an awful lot of value here for only five dollars - it's at least a hundred hand-made puzzles - but I really want there to be no unnecessary obstacles. After the campaign, I'll likely sell it for $5.99 - you're saving money getting it now!</p><p>My deadline to complete and deliver the book is the end of May, 2014. That's aggressive, but I've nothing better to do with my time right now, and even if some stretch goals are hit I foresee no issues making that date. If bad things happen, well, the nice thing about digital distribution is that it's trivial to provide updates, but I don't suspect that will be necessary.</p><h4>ALL THE LOOPINESS</h4><p>Simple addition. You get the book and the ""40"" puzzle for $5 + $1 = $6. Math is convenient.</p><h4>ALL THE PUZZLES</h4><p>Now we're talking. As mentioned before, back the book and the sampler, and I'll throw in the ""40"" for no extra cost. That will get you every (public) puzzle I have on offer here for eight dollars.</p><h4>THE STRETCH PERK (!!)</h4><p>So I had this brainstorm. What could I possibly offer someone who's willing to spend more than eight dollars on me (I should be so lucky) without sending anything physical or committing myself to some additional projects when I'm trying to get a book done? And then it hit me: the excitement and satisfaction of being the one to meet a stretch goal! After all, I'm not likely to hit stretch goals with just sub-ten-dollar pledges anyhow (unless I'm luckier than I'm certain I am, or so I figure).</p><p>Introducing: the stretch <em>perk! </em>Back this perk (or any more expensive one) and congrats, we just hit a stretch goal! <strong><em>Each individual pledge </em>at this level meets its own stretch goal.</strong> For twenty-five USD, I will - in addition to giving you ""ALL THE PUZZLES"" - take one of the ten-by-ten puzzles in my book and <em>double</em> its size to ten-by-<em>twenty</em>. For everybody. It'll be a permanent upgrade to the book. You'll be a hero to us all. And everyone who reads the book will <em>know</em> you're that hero, because - if you wish - I will <em>credit</em> you for that heroism right in the book, <em>right next to the puzzle</em> I've double-sized in your honor! This is the only means I'm offering of getting credited in the book - it's not like anyone reads through those massive backer lists most crowdfunded projects generate anyhow, hidden in the back of the book or the sides of the box or somesuch. Your name (or handle or whatever, as long as it's family-friendly), if you want it there, will be right in the thick of it where it will be <em>seen</em>. So... can I pencil you in to make history and be a backer to the <em>original</em> stretch perk?</p><h4>...TO CALL YOUR OWN</h4><p>I figured, while we're here and all, if someone wanted to commission me to make a puzzle, why not give them the chance and let everyone benefit? So for $50 - that's $25 over THE STRETCH PERK - you get that perk (natch) and a puzzle made by hand by me for you, with an eternal license to use it for any non-illegal, non-defamatory purpose you so desire just as long as anywhere you put that puzzle you put the proper credit for its creator with it. That's it. Publish it in a magazine or a book of your own - just give me a byline - and make a profit out of it. Incorporate it into a work of art or a computer game (or something that's both) and sell it - it's yours to wield. The puzzle itself may be any style of logic-based, grid-based puzzle that appears on my journal or, indeed, most anyone else's (though some types are clearly beyond me); I would encourage you if you're interested in this to contact me directly with what you have in mind <em>before</em> pledging at this level.

A standard-size puzzle becomes DOUBLE-SIZE: EACH STRETCH PERK!
Executive Summary (tl;dr):
In a world where a championship puzzle-maker without job or car tries to make ends meet, he offers the world a puzzle book series revealing every secret trick he knows to solve them, and this is the first book in that series, based on one of the most popular pure-logic competition puzzle types - the loop puzzle. Don't know what those are? NO PROBLEM! I'll walk you through every step of the way, giving you the knowledge to join the masters. Already a master? NO PROBLEM! With at least 100 hand-crafted, learning-focused puzzles, you'll have plenty of practice! Book will be provided as a .PDF file only. Perks include a sampler of other puzzle types, puzzle commissions, and the first-ever STRETCH PERK - each one makes the book bigger!
Who? What? Why?My name is Adam R. Wood, and I am a puzzlesmith. You may know me by my handle - The Zotmeister - and actually know me primarily as a gamer, specifically one that doesn't drink, smoke, or do drugs, or perhaps you've encountered my character in that one indie game or that one card game,  but I am just as passionate and active in the puzzle community as I am in the gaming community, if not even more so. Nine years ago, I pioneered the online puzzle journal, spawning numerous imitators homages, and I've contributed to the national championships for the last seven years.In all that time, I've never made an actual puzzle book. The opportunity never arose. With your help, that changes now. However, this is not the typical ""here's a bunch of puzzles, now give me my money"" sort of book I see all too often. Over the years, I've built quite the mental toolbox of techniques and tricks for crafting and solving all sorts of logic-based puzzles, and I won't be content simply spitting out stumpers and sitting back. I want to make the sort of puzzle book that is perhaps rarest of all: the sort that actually teaches how to solve puzzles.Hence, the Puzzle Primer Series. With each volume dedicated to all the ins-and-outs of a specific genre, you'll get an unprecedented insider's view of what makes puzzles tick. If you're an absolute beginner, perhaps fascinated by them but have no idea how to begin to approach them, I'll walk you through it step by step. If you're a competitive tournament solver, my puzzles will offer detailed practice for specific situations, and my techniques may streamline your process and reduce your times. If you're anywhere in between, you'll have a lot of fun, you'll hopefully learn some neat things, and by the end you should be ready for whatever's out there.Oh, and did I mention every single puzzle it contains will be composed by hand? Because they totally will be. There's little art in computer-generated puzzles, and besides, I'll be tailoring each and every puzzle in this book to be as instructive as possible. A well-designed puzzle speaks to the solver; my intent is to make what they say crystal clear, each one adding to the foundation for future puzzles.For this first volume, I'm tackling what is by far the most popular style of puzzle from my journal: the loop puzzle. I was the first to unify the genre, so I'm uniquely qualified to explore in detail the inner workings of not just Slitherlink but also Masyu, Yajilin and other loop-puzzle types, and especially how they can interact in hybrid puzzles - something rarely seen outside of competitions, but that will definitely be covered in my book!
What's a loop puzzle? What's Slitherlink?Remember doing connect-the-dots when you were a kid? Loop puzzles are the logic-based puzzle version of that. There's (usually) no discernible figure in the result [and let's face it, you probably knew you were drawing an elephant or somesuch all along], but other than that, the principle is pretty similar: you have an array of dots - usually in a nice, neat grid here - and are given clues regarding how they are to be connected into a single closed loop. These dots aren't numbered - in fact, most loop puzzles don't actually use every dot in their loop. Figuring out which dots to use, and how, is all part of the puzzle. Here's a sample before-and-after (the book will have MUCH better graphics):
Slitherlink, specifically, is the most popular and by far the most common style of loop puzzle: all the clues are numbers inside the cells (between the dots) of the grid. Even though those digits are limited to just '0', '1', '2', and '3', the depth of the logic in Slitherlink puzzles can be astounding. Other styles of loop puzzles can involve gaps in the grid (sometimes with larger numbers in them!) and/or special types of dots that must be used, often in specific ways. No matter what's thrown at you, however, there's always only one way that a single loop can be formed that adheres to all the clues. Knowing how the clues interact with each other is typically the main means of solving, but the very nature of a loop itself is often key!What's going to be in this book?Let me say this straight away: this is not going to be just a collection of puzzles. There will be text. This will be an actual book. Don't worry, though - it won't read like a textbook. It will be informal while still being thorough, getting through just enough exposition to get you from one puzzle to the next. For the curious, there will also be information about the history of the puzzles, some math facts regarding the puzzles, and other trivia.The meat-and-potatoes of the book, however, is of course the puzzles themselves. They will lead you through the entire process of mastery, starting with puzzles based on basic loop logic, then introducing more complex clue types - and hidden patterns within them! - one at a time. The accompanying text and diagrams - like the one below - will point out what to look for, clearly defining all sorts of solving elements: short circuits, corners, power towers, parity breaks, and those pesky entry-and-exit rules, to name a few. As you solve, you'll eventually find yourself automatically thinking things like ""can't bounce off that dented two"" and ""that trick never works"" and before you realize it, you'll be an expert.
There's absolutely no way anything less than a hundred puzzles will suffice for this book. Slitherlink alone is deep enough to cover half that! I will be alternating between Slitherlink and other styles of loop puzzles so as to keep the difficulty curve smooth throughout the book. At the end will be hybrid puzzles, putting everything you'll have learned together - along with some final techniques the hybridization itself brings to bear! - into a unified challenge. When you're done, you'll know everything I know about loop puzzles, and hopefully will find it to be the most satisfying puzzle book you've ever worked through.
What is this book going to be, exactly?
Okay, so here's the deal: I agree that there's no substitute for having a printed puzzle book in your hands, pushing a pencil across the page... but I can't help but feel that such would be getting ahead of myself. As I'm typing this pitch, I really have no clue what the market for an uncommon book like this really is, beyond a core group that have been aching for something like this for, like, ages. So that's why I'm taking this in phases - planning multiple volumes, working on one at a time, and cutting out as many middlemen as feasible in the meantime. Hopefully, somewhere down the line, these will be sufficiently popular that getting a publisher for a traditional physical book can be made to happen, or at least I could try crowdfunding such a thing with much less risk. But for now, the book will be created as, and provided as, purely a .PDF document.Think about that for a moment, though. No shipping! As soon as it's done, it's in your inbox, with no further hassle at my end or tension at yours. If there are any errors discovered in the book - if you know my puzzle pedigree, you'll know this is extremely unlikely, but if it somehow happens anyway - I can fix them and have an updated version sent to you promptly. And it saves paper! You'll likely only want to print the puzzles themselves, not the textual portions - and the book will be formatted to facilitate this - so that'll be fewer trees pulped and ink sprayed. Or perhaps you have a smartphone that can read .PDF files as an ebook [N.B.: you're on your own for this, I can't even begin to offer smartphone support].The best part of this, though, is the simple fact that you'll get the book in your possession without paying anyone other than me: your funds will go directly to supporting me and making this book the best I can for what I raise.As mentioned earlier, the book will have at least one hundred loop puzzles; each will be at least a ten-by-ten grid (eleven-by-eleven counting the dots). Some may be larger out of need or as a stretch perk [see below for details on that little innovation!]; the overall puzzle count can increase with stretch goals, but rest assured I've given myself plenty of time to meet my deadline even if we find this campaign rolling in dough.What's in it for me?THE PERKSSHOW ME THE FORTYA little backstory: on my thirtieth birthday, I gave my journal followers a gift - a whopper of a hybrid loop puzzle over a 29-by-29 grid (30-by-30 going by the dots rather than the cells). It's here if you want to see it, but it's not for the faint of heart (you may want to finish my book first!). It proved very popular (and inspirational for some), so I made a 35-dot-by-35-dot followup... six years later. Yes, a year late, but that's something I intend to make up for. On Earth Day, 2015, I'll put on my journal a 40-dot-by-40-dot behemoth... a year early.But pledge me a lowly dollar and I'll show it to you a full year earlier than that! If you want to support my project but either have little to spare [trust me, I know the feeling] or figure I can't possibly teach you anything you don't already know about loop puzzles (and that may even be true for some of you, but not many) and just want something truly staggering to tackle, then this humble (if large) option is for you.This perk will be delivered to its backers on Earth Day, 2014, regardless of any other perks they may have coming.FRESH DOZENDon't like loop puzzles? I have an option for that as well: how does a sampler of a dozen of my original puzzle types sound? Yes? Pretty? Hm? Two each of Island Oases (note the plural, it's new and improved!), Totally Rooked, Smullyanic Dynasty, Pokerum (a simplified Heartbreaker), Astral Wayfarer (I just renamed Seeking Syren), and some Sudoku variant I'm keeping secret for now... All puzzles will have grids of size 10-by-10 or larger. Yes, even the Sudoku. These puzzles will only be available to backers for at least a year - they will never be put on my journal or any other website before then, and they won't be any cheaper than the three bucks I'm asking for them now. Pinky swear. This perk will be delivered to its backers by the end of April, 2014, regardless of any other perks they may have coming. This is a month before the book is due, so if you'd like to add this in with a book order, it'll give you something to whet your appetite. In fact, I'll sweeten that deal even further: get the book and the sampler, and I'll show you the forty for free! The option you're looking for up there on the right for this is ""ALL THE PUZZLES"".LUCKY THIRTEENTwo, two, two perks in one! Thirteen puzzles, four dollars. Not sure why anyone wouldn't just add a buck and get the book proper, but I'm nothing if not thorough.THE BOOKWhy we're here! I can't help but feel I'm offering an awful lot of value here for only five dollars - it's at least a hundred hand-made puzzles - but I really want there to be no unnecessary obstacles. After the campaign, I'll likely sell it for $5.99 - you're saving money getting it now!My deadline to complete and deliver the book is the end of May, 2014. That's aggressive, but I've nothing better to do with my time right now, and even if some stretch goals are hit I foresee no issues making that date. If bad things happen, well, the nice thing about digital distribution is that it's trivial to provide updates, but I don't suspect that will be necessary.ALL THE LOOPINESSSimple addition. You get the book and the ""40"" puzzle for $5 + $1 = $6. Math is convenient.ALL THE PUZZLESNow we're talking. As mentioned before, back the book and the sampler, and I'll throw in the ""40"" for no extra cost. That will get you every (public) puzzle I have on offer here for eight dollars.THE STRETCH PERK (!!)So I had this brainstorm. What could I possibly offer someone who's willing to spend more than eight dollars on me (I should be so lucky) without sending anything physical or committing myself to some additional projects when I'm trying to get a book done? And then it hit me: the excitement and satisfaction of being the one to meet a stretch goal! After all, I'm not likely to hit stretch goals with just sub-ten-dollar pledges anyhow (unless I'm luckier than I'm certain I am, or so I figure).Introducing: the stretch perk! Back this perk (or any more expensive one) and congrats, we just hit a stretch goal! Each individual pledge at this level meets its own stretch goal. For twenty-five USD, I will - in addition to giving you ""ALL THE PUZZLES"" - take one of the ten-by-ten puzzles in my book and double its size to ten-by-twenty. For everybody. It'll be a permanent upgrade to the book. You'll be a hero to us all. And everyone who reads the book will know you're that hero, because - if you wish - I will credit you for that heroism right in the book, right next to the puzzle I've double-sized in your honor! This is the only means I'm offering of getting credited in the book - it's not like anyone reads through those massive backer lists most crowdfunded projects generate anyhow, hidden in the back of the book or the sides of the box or somesuch. Your name (or handle or whatever, as long as it's family-friendly), if you want it there, will be right in the thick of it where it will be seen. So... can I pencil you in to make history and be a backer to the original stretch perk?...TO CALL YOUR OWNI figured, while we're here and all, if someone wanted to commission me to make a puzzle, why not give them the chance and let everyone benefit? So for $50 - that's $25 over THE STRETCH PERK - you get that perk (natch) and a puzzle made by hand by me for you, with an eternal license to use it for any non-illegal, non-defamatory purpose you so desire just as long as anywhere you put that puzzle you put the proper credit for its creator with it. That's it. Publish it in a magazine or a book of your own - just give me a byline - and make a profit out of it. Incorporate it into a work of art or a computer game (or something that's both) and sell it - it's yours to wield. The puzzle itself may be any style of logic-based, grid-based puzzle that appears on my journal or, indeed, most anyone else's (though some types are clearly beyond me); I would encourage you if you're interested in this to contact me directly with what you have in mind before pledging at this level. I don't want to leave anyone disappointed. All reasonable requests will be attempted to the best of my ability. Want the givens to be in a certain pattern, perhaps spelling out something? Should be easy! Do that all the time. Want it easy? hard? moderate? Your call.The only other restriction is the puzzle's size. I'm limiting it to 11 cells in each of its two dimensions at the maximum. ...Unless you'd like to pay for more. For a $100 pledge, I'll up that limit to 21 cells. Nearly double in each direction - you're getting an extra cell per dollar (beyond the stretch perk)!Any puzzles either of these perks engender will be delivered by the end of June, 2014. The book comes first, you understand. As you're working through the book - that will be delivered in May - I'll be working through any commissions.THE SHIRT OFF MY BACK [SOLD OUT!]I couldn't resist making this a perk. I mean the name quite literally. I doubt anyone will go for it, but for fun I decided to put this out there. As I mentioned at the beginning of this pitch, I'm kind of geek-famous for several lines I had in a certain videogame documentary. In most of my scenes, I'm wearing a t-shirt depicting a VCS joystick and captioned ""REPRESENT.""; when my likeness was used in the pair of crowdfunded projects I linked above [I miss discretionary income], my depicters replicated the shirt in my images. I still have that shirt, and I'd continued to wear it until fairly recently. You see, it's developed some holes, including a rather awkward one right in the front (along the white part in the center of the joystick). If you have skill stitching and hopes of wearing it (please don't tell me), I forget if it's an L or XL - the tag's faded to translucence.I have no idea what it might actually be worth to a movie prop collector, but if you're willing to find out, well, $250 is my price. The stretch perk is included in that, natch. I'll also make up and hand-sign a certificate to verify its authenticity. If you'd like, I could also sign the back of the shirt itself, or even write one of my quotes on it if you wish, or you could just take it as is.Photos can be provided on request.This is one of only two physical items I'm offering; if you want this, I'll need a shipping address. If it's outside the United States (hey, I'm big in England), I'll need an extra $6 added to your pledge, and a friendly reminder: handling customs at your end is your responsibility. I will ship via the United States Postal Service, insured.MY KINGDOM FOR YOUR PLEDGEI am a man of little money but many treasures. One of those treasures is a complete, unplayed set of English-language Portal Three Kingdoms cards for that collectible card game. I lucked out on that one: I acquired it before the cards became Eternal-format tournament legal and their price skyrocketed. The largest online retailer for the game would, as of this writing, be charging more for this than I am, and they don't even have one in stock! Besides, all you could hope to get from them is near-mint-condition cards. Mine are unplayed.Why would I offer such a thing? I'll tell you: this perk is - I can't resist the pun, I'm very sorry - the magic bullet.

Please help get the word out!You do have stretch goals, right?It wouldn't be much of a crowdfunding campaign without them, would it?

<p>It has always been my passion to inspire excellence in young people. In 2001, I was given the opportunity to do just that with hundreds of inner-city youth in the city of Philadelphia. Working with young people, I was able to understand the needs that, having grown up in the inner-city myself, I thought I knew. I was able to see the potential of young people from my community from a different, more experienced perspective. I was also able to understand the needs differently as well. I then had my first child, my daughter, and I truly realized how great my passion was. Not only did I want to inspire young people; I wanted to empower young people to be excellent <em>and</em> help them build an environment that is excellent for them and their future- a future that my children will be a part of. </p>
<p>But what did that mean? Children are exposed to a plethora of ideas, experiences, realities and fantasies. There are many stories in all sorts of mediums (books, television, etc.) that help guide our young. However, much of the stories that influence our youth lack a message that relates to their history. And if we are unaware of our history, we are unsure of our future. </p>
<p>And while my passion is, in deed, to inspire excellence is young people; my ultimate goal is to connect our youth to their future with a strong foundation- pride in their history.  </p>

<span class=""notranlsate""><p>Although <em>The Poor Man and His Princess</em> is a fictional tale, it is a story that illustrates a setting, a message and an aspect of history, that our young people seldom learn about in today's stories. Set in West Africa several hundred years ago, <em>The Poor Man and His Princess</em> exposes the reader to a time and place of royalty of many sorts. The characters in this story display characteristics found across the wide spectrum of royalty- from humility to pride; from sadness to joy. The setting of The Poor Man and His Princess is one of true history- <em>""when kingdoms were still growing... Just west of the rice fields and north of the okra.""</em>  </p>
<p>Many of our young people today learn about ""the Disney princess,"" and royalty in magical fantasy worlds that they find difficult relating to. <em>The Poor Man and His Princess</em> exposes our young people to characters so real and relevant to our history that the readers may not only feel a connection to them, they may even find it possible to have descended from them. </p>
<p><span><em>The Poor Man and His Princess</em> is a story that can inspire young people to be great no matter the environment from which they are. It is a tale unconditional love, growth, connection and home.</span></p>

<p>Much time and money has already been devoted to this small project already. Still, in order for this story to be impactful; and in order for there to be real exposure that can be meaningful and fruitful, many more resources are needed.

It has always been my passion to inspire excellence in young people. In 2001, I was given the opportunity to do just that with hundreds of inner-city youth in the city of Philadelphia. Working with young people, I was able to understand the needs that, having grown up in the inner-city myself, I thought I knew. I was able to see the potential of young people from my community from a different, more experienced perspective. I was also able to understand the needs differently as well. I then had my first child, my daughter, and I truly realized how great my passion was. Not only did I want to inspire young people; I wanted to empower young people to be excellent and help them build an environment that is excellent for them and their future- a future that my children will be a part of. 
But what did that mean? Children are exposed to a plethora of ideas, experiences, realities and fantasies. There are many stories in all sorts of mediums (books, television, etc.) that help guide our young. However, much of the stories that influence our youth lack a message that relates to their history. And if we are unaware of our history, we are unsure of our future. 
And while my passion is, in deed, to inspire excellence is young people; my ultimate goal is to connect our youth to their future with a strong foundation- pride in their history.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Into the Unknown: Human Curiosity, Politics, and Prejudice in the True Space Age</i> is about how we can stay curious, connected, and educated as humanity enters the new “True Space Age” in the upcoming years. <br/><br/>My name is Ellena Hyeji Joo and I am the author of Into the Unknown. I wrote this book for my brother, who is a high school student interested in space, aliens, and pretty much all the popular franchises set in space. As our daily conversations on space, aliens, and the upcoming milestones in humanity grew, I realized that this is a critical topic! What will we do in the face of so much unknown as we enter space? Do we understand space? Do we understand who we are in the universe?<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what it means for you to be part of one species dedicated to exploring its meaning beyond our planet, solar system, or even our galaxy. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for space. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you feel excited for the True Space Age and feel equipped with the challenges and information that come hand-in-hand with our entering space. <br/><br/>In this book, you’ll learn about space, aliens, and humanity. You’ll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Why we are attracted to the idea of aliens as creatures that will come invade our planet</li>
<li>What it means for us that federal agencies like NASA (with political motives) are leading space exploration projects and the politics behind space exploration</li>
<li>What it means that space exploration is becoming increasingly privatized and how companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are benefiting and undermining technological advancements in space</li>
<li>How we can protect our sense of wonder when it comes to space</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you enjoy the Marvel Universe, Star Wars, Star Trek, and any movies set in space with aliens, but you have also always been attracted to understanding why we gravitate towards these movies and are inclined to explore the questions such movies raise.</p>
<p>Into the Unknown: Human Curiosity, Politics, and Prejudice in the True Space Age is a nonfiction book that speaks to the ordinary person curious about space, young space entrepreneurs, and space enthusiasts who want to look at the meaning of “aliens” and “space” in a new way.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Into the Unknown: Human Curiosity, Politics, and Prejudice in the True Space Age</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts. <br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction and chapters 1 - 4. It explores “how we got here,” including our brief history of aliens, alienation, why we are afraid of all things aliens or ‘unknown’ or ‘spacey’ and why these questions are critical to answer and discuss right now. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2 </strong>contains chapters 5-7. This section explores principles of positive alien engagement and for “aliens” on Earth as well.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 8-11. This section explores how to live a curious, and open-minded life to prepare for the True Space Age. It goes over controversial topics, such as ""Why is America turning space American?""; and how can we stay realistic but hopeful and optimistic for upcoming discoveries?</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Ellena Hyeji Joo is a senior at Georgetown University, School of Foreign Service. She is majoring in International Politics and minoring in Journalism. <br/><br/>Ellena wrote this book because she is passionate about answering bigger, deeper questions whose answers may be key to protecting our future, values, and evolving our humanity to stay focused on what really matters. Ellena hopes to leave an impact in young adults who seek a career that requires curiosity, creativity, and thinking outside the box (or even outside of the planet). She is curious about how difficult conversations can change the world, such as why it is difficult to stay actively curious and optimistic in the space age. <br/><br/>Ellena loves spending time with her family, especially her younger brother, who loves to introduce her to new series on space (there are so many!) and guide her through the messy, but wonderful thoughts a person can have surrounding the topics of space and aliens. She loves reading, writing, and chasing dogs and cats in her neighborhood even though she knows she is deathly allergic to them (the animals also seem allergic to her over enthusiasm). <br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Ellena Hyeji Joo at hj231@georgetown.edu or at @ellenajoo_writes on instagram.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><strong><i>Everyday Impact</i></strong> is exploring the concept of social impact. This book dives into how different people from various industries and walks of life create positive change in the communities around them in their own way. It places a unique emphasis on, what I like to call, the concept of “<i>Everyday Impact</i>”; how one small action can have a ripple effect. This book looks into how small actions, when done consistently over time, can create a compounding effect that leads to an even greater impact in the future. <br/><br/>My name is Erin Feng and I am the author of Everyday Impact. I wrote this book because there is much misconception around what social impact truly is. In an age of big businesses and millionaires, it’s easy to feel like our individual contributions are negligent in comparison to big corporations dishing out billions in donations to fight climate change and other social issues. It can be disheartening. I want to bring the conversation back to the everyday people, like you and me, who have an abundance of potential to create an impact beyond our initial beliefs. <br/><br/>In reading this book, my hope is that you will discover the potential and power within yourself to make a difference in the society around you. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for social impact and personal development. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you go above-and-beyond the status quo and find meaningful purpose in working for the betterment of people outside of yourself.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about three principles which I call the “3 I's of Meaningful Change.” These fundamental principles are key traits of today's change-makers. I also share the ideas of applying them to your own life. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>The journey of Muhammad Yunus and how he used $27 to redefine the banking industry and create an entirely new field of Microfinance. </li>
<li>The interesting concept of “purpose over profit” will be explored through the purposeful redemption story of Scott Harrison who went from nightclub promoter to the founder of the renowned organization charity, Water.</li>
<li>Finally, we’ll see the magical concept of the “golden ticket” in action through the story of a successful magician, Claude Haggerty, and how a $10 magic show ticket inspired him down a path of impact and meaning, using magic to raise over $4 million for charity. </li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are on a quest for personal development and have the desire to leave a lasting legacy you can be proud of. </p>
<p><br/><i>Everyday Impact</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to driven youth and open-minded adults who want to look at social impact and personal success in a new way.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book - Everyday Impact</h3>
<p>The book is written in five parts:<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the Introduction and Chapter One: “A Brief History of Social Impact” and Chapter Two: “Why Now?” This preliminary section is more technical, containing detailed overviews of the history of social impact and the impact revolution as we know it today. Pulling research from reputable sources, you will see how CSR went from an unknown term to a social norm. You will also learn how some of the world’s greatest changemakers like Muhammad Yunus started from humble beginnings and went on to redefine industries. These chapters set up the foundation and tone for the ensuing text.  <br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters Three: “From Hardships to Inspiration“ and Chapter Four: ”Purpose over Profit“. Here we begin diving into the first principle of “Everyday Impact” known as the Inspiration section. These two chapters will speak to familiar topics such as the influence of one’s past on present behaviors, as well as, the ubiquitous idea of purpose over profit. What you’ll find is that these chapters are very “real”; they’re not afraid to define hardships. They tell the stories of real people who have overcome intense but relatable challenges. <br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapter Five: “Community Impact”, Chapter Six: “Power of Kindness”, Chapter Seven: “Everyday Advocacy”, Chapter Eight: “Corporate Giving &amp; the Power of Business”, and Chapter Nine: Young Impact“. Like the “Impact” section of this book, we dive into the specific stories of people from all walks of life, from chiropractors to students to entrepreneurs, and how they have created a positive impact in their own way. Not only will you be moved by these individuals, but imbued within their stories of impact are the insights and personal lessons they learned throughout their journey to enhance their own contributions. <br/><br/>Part 4 contains Chapter Ten: “Taking a Leap of Faith” and Chapter Eleven: “Challenging the Conventional”. In this section, we explore the final principle of “Innovation,” and how community change-makers have innovated to augment their impact and leave a legacy. You’ll hear stories of everyday people who have done extraordinary things, from a life development coach who used the lesson of “leaps of faith” to develop a new effective and unique approach to serve his clients, to a physiotherapist going above-and-beyond to help her clients during COVID-19.<br/><br/>Part 5 contains Chapter Twelve: “Putting it All Together” and the Conclusion. This final section will summarize the teachings shared from the previous sections and show how to truly drive Everyday Impact. You’ll hear the story of Claude Haggerty, a renowned magician who raised over $4 million for charity. You will also learn how he implemented each of the 3 I’s of Meaningful Change throughout his life of impact and meaning</p>

Everyday Impact is exploring the concept of social impact. This book dives into how different people from various industries and walks of life create positive change in the communities around them in their own way. It places a unique emphasis on, what I like to call, the concept of “Everyday Impact”; how one small action can have a ripple effect. This book looks into how small actions, when done consistently over time, can create a compounding effect that leads to an even greater impact in the future. My name is Erin Feng and I am the author of Everyday Impact. I wrote this book because there is much misconception around what social impact truly is. In an age of big businesses and millionaires, it’s easy to feel like our individual contributions are negligent in comparison to big corporations dishing out billions in donations to fight climate change and other social issues. It can be disheartening. I want to bring the conversation back to the everyday people, like you and me, who have an abundance of potential to create an impact beyond our initial beliefs. In reading this book, my hope is that you will discover the potential and power within yourself to make a difference in the society around you. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for social impact and personal development. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you go above-and-beyond the status quo and find meaningful purpose in working for the betterment of people outside of yourself.In this book, you'll learn about three principles which I call the “3 I's of Meaningful Change.” These fundamental principles are key traits of today's change-makers. I also share the ideas of applying them to your own life. You'll hear stories such as...

The journey of Muhammad Yunus and how he used $27 to redefine the banking industry and create an entirely new field of Microfinance. 
The interesting concept of “purpose over profit” will be explored through the purposeful redemption story of Scott Harrison who went from nightclub promoter to the founder of the renowned organization charity, Water.
Finally, we’ll see the magical concept of the “golden ticket” in action through the story of a successful magician, Claude Haggerty, and how a $10 magic show ticket inspired him down a path of impact and meaning, using magic to raise over $4 million for charity. 

You will love this book if you are on a quest for personal development and have the desire to leave a lasting legacy you can be proud of. 
Everyday Impact is a nonfiction book that speaks to driven youth and open-minded adults who want to look at social impact and personal success in a new way.
 

The Book - Everyday Impact
The book is written in five parts:Part 1 contains the Introduction and Chapter One: “A Brief History of Social Impact” and Chapter Two: “Why Now?” This preliminary section is more technical, containing detailed overviews of the history of social impact and the impact revolution as we know it today. Pulling research from reputable sources, you will see how CSR went from an unknown term to a social norm. You will also learn how some of the world’s greatest changemakers like Muhammad Yunus started from humble beginnings and went on to redefine industries. These chapters set up the foundation and tone for the ensuing text.  Part 2 contains Chapters Three: “From Hardships to Inspiration“ and Chapter Four: ”Purpose over Profit“. Here we begin diving into the first principle of “Everyday Impact” known as the Inspiration section. These two chapters will speak to familiar topics such as the influence of one’s past on present behaviors, as well as, the ubiquitous idea of purpose over profit. What you’ll find is that these chapters are very “real”; they’re not afraid to define hardships. They tell the stories of real people who have overcome intense but relatable challenges. Part 3 contains Chapter Five: “Community Impact”, Chapter Six: “Power of Kindness”, Chapter Seven: “Everyday Advocacy”, Chapter Eight: “Corporate Giving & the Power of Business”, and Chapter Nine: Young Impact“. Like the “Impact” section of this book, we dive into the specific stories of people from all walks of life, from chiropractors to students to entrepreneurs, and how they have created a positive impact in their own way. Not only will you be moved by these individuals, but imbued within their stories of impact are the insights and personal lessons they learned throughout their journey to enhance their own contributions. Part 4 contains Chapter Ten: “Taking a Leap of Faith” and Chapter Eleven: “Challenging the Conventional”. In this section, we explore the final principle of “Innovation,” and how community change-makers have innovated to augment their impact and leave a legacy. You’ll hear stories of everyday people who have done extraordinary things, from a life development coach who used the lesson of “leaps of faith” to develop a new effective and unique approach to serve his clients, to a physiotherapist going above-and-beyond to help her clients during COVID-19.Part 5 contains Chapter Twelve: “Putting it All Together” and the Conclusion. This final section will summarize the teachings shared from the previous sections and show how to truly drive Everyday Impact. You’ll hear the story of Claude Haggerty, a renowned magician who raised over $4 million for charity. You will also learn how he implemented each of the 3 I’s of Meaningful Change throughout his life of impact and meaning

<h3>Why I'm Crowdfunding This Book<br/>
</h3>
</div><div> <p>I want this book to go out directly to as many readers as possible. The campaign target above reflects not so much the money needed to launch this book, as much as what it represents in terms of readers. If I knew that at least 500 composers and orchestrators out there were gaining new valuable insights and building their approaches to the sprawling craft of orchestration, I would call that a launch. In the end, raising the level of understanding in our entire field only helps the music to become ever more potent as we all become stronger artists.</p>
<p>What's more, here's an opportunity for us to show the established world of publishing that we are a strong community, worthy of their respect. The more direct support a project like this receives, the greater the awareness will build across many other communities. Let's make it clear to them all that a book like this has readers who are committed to a subject that is like no other in interest, appeal, and variety.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>How I'll Use Your Funds</h3> <p>These days, I'm finding my time taken up more and more by orchestration projects from all over the world, with clients from many countries like Canada, India, Russia, and the United States. I love this job, but it has its challenges, forcing me to prioritize work as it's offered, and carefully schedule projects over the course of a year. The funding level I've requested above will help me to set aside a solid block of time - say 4 to 6 weeks - during which I can commit nearly all of my available time to completing this text on behalf of my readers. It will also help me to maintain and improve many of the assets I use to benefit my fellow orchestrators, like equipment, software, and expenses related to maintaining and managing our community's presence on the internet.</p>

</div></div>","Who I Am and Who You Are
I'm Thomas Goss. Welcome to my Indiegogo page! If you're viewing this campaign, it means that you're interested in orchestration. More than that, you're passionate about it. You know that as a composer or arranger, the orchestra provides the most liberating, inspirational canvas for your creativity.
I feel the same exact way. As a professional composer, I've made orchestration the main focus of my career, composing and arranging many hours of orchestral music for film, dance, theater, and the concert stage. I know how the finer details can be so fascinating, so revealing, opening up many new possibilities of color and texture. 


It's the kind of pursuit that's long needed its own interactive network in which orchestrators can help each other to grow through support, feedback, and sharing of resources. That's why I created the internet community Orchestration Online, bringing thousands of composers at all levels of experience together on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. I've been watching you develop, interact, and reach out for information and perspective. This is your book as much as it is mine. And I want it on your screens next year.


Why You Need This Book
Orchestration manuals tell you the basics: the varieties, characteristics, techniques, and ranges of orchestral instruments; how they're generally used; and some useful samples to study.
What really makes an orchestral score come alive? Imagination backed up by confidence and practical knowledge. What do the musicians know, and how does that affect how they perform your music? What are the consequences of using certain approaches? How do instruments and sections relate to one another?
What's needed is a book that reflects the perspective and experience of working orchestrators, showing how they think and why they make certain choices.



What Kind of a Book and When

I plan to launch ""100 Orchestration Tips"" as an e-book, published in a full-screen format. It will be e-mailed directly to supporters of this campaign, whose minimum donation will grant them a copy. I plan to release the book by March 15, 2015.
After this campaign closes, I will shift sales over to an internet store on the main Orchestration Online website. The book will then be sold from that location. But if we gain enough momentum by its initial release, it may prove to be a book that could cross to the print world. If it does, so will the credibility and reputation of this community.

An update above about how our campaign is going, with more information about the ""5 Orchestral Textures"" perk




What You'll Find in ""100 Orchestration Tips""
Mostly, it will be the kind of information you don't find in an orchestration manual:

An introduction discussing the evolution of the orchestration process, how modern orchestrators work, and how to increase your speed and efficiency to make more time for the tools of the imagination.
100 detailed tips on orchestration, with many illustrations showing the advice in action. Some of these tips will be adapted and expanded from those already available on the Orchestration Online website. Others will be completely new, rounding out the information to cover all main sections of the orchestra.
An added section of 30 commonly asked questions, to take a lot of the guesswork out of the many challenges faced by professional orchestrators and composer.



Have a look at some sample orchestration tips above in video format...

Why I'm Crowdfunding This Book

 I want this book to go out directly to as many readers as possible. The campaign target above reflects not so much the money needed to launch this book, as much as what it represents in terms of readers. If I knew that at least 500 composers and orchestrators out there were gaining new valuable insights and building their approaches to the sprawling craft of orchestration, I would call that a launch. In the end, raising the level of understanding in our entire field only helps the music to become ever more potent as we all become stronger artists.
What's more, here's an opportunity for us to show the established world of publishing that we are a strong community, worthy of their respect. The more direct support a project like this receives, the greater the awareness will build across many other communities. Let's make it clear to them all that a book like this has readers who are committed to a subject that is like no other in interest, appeal, and variety.

  
How I'll Use Your Funds These days, I'm finding my time taken up more and more by orchestration projects from all over the world, with clients from many countries like Canada, India, Russia, and the United States. I love this job, but it has its challenges, forcing me to prioritize work as it's offered, and carefully schedule projects over the course of a year. The funding level I've requested above will help me to set aside a solid block of time - say 4 to 6 weeks - during which I can commit nearly all of my available time to completing this text on behalf of my readers. It will also help me to maintain and improve many of the assets I use to benefit my fellow orchestrators, like equipment, software, and expenses related to maintaining and managing our community's presence on the internet.






My orchestration for composer Dmitry Rybnikov's score to ""The Magic Tower.""


The Bottom Line
After all that I've said above about this launch, what it really boils down to is that I'm offering a reasonably priced book, with information you're going to find helpful. Sure, I've offered some additional perks, and I recommend checking them out. I'd love to show you a preview of some larger-scale training I'll be offering next year, include your questions and suggestions in the book, and even mentor a few of you directly. That would be an honor. But ""100 Orchestration Tips"" is going to be great fun to write for you all, and I can't wait to hear how you put the information to use in your own music.

DESIGN: Design is important both the cover and blog. 

MARKETING: Editing is needed and might have to use a better editor.

EDITING:  I’m also looking to do some better marketing, like getting listings, marketing blasts of the story to established lists and so on. 
Depending on how much is contributed I’ll look for the based way to put it to good use. 
Why is a small sci-fi story like this important and what can it do? 
Some people don’t think storytelling is important. I think storytelling and science fiction is important to people like me and there are millions of us.

<p>Set
in the raw Hellish throes of the Liberian Civil War, following the introduction
of a shoe-shine boy who is confronted by the invasion of his town, the novel
fast forwards a decade to the war’s 2003 <i>historical</i>
climax.</p>
<p>With
the capital and President Charles Taylor besieged from an array of triumphant
rebel forces all lusting for further spoils, only six days remain until
Taylor’s US, UN and Nigerian-brokered resign-and-depart-into-exile deadline.</p>
<p>Accordingly,
the tension is skyrocketing - will Taylor go voluntarily or will there be a
bloodbath?<span>  Will there be a bloodbath
anyway?</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile,
an obscure rebel group deep in the interior (at a
place called ‘The Crossing’) unexpectedly seeks, under UN auspices, to disarm.</p>
<p>Requiring expatriate monitors, but with most
foreigners already evacuated, the resultant ragtag group of six consists of: a
UN professional; a doctor &amp; spy; a boilermaker businessman; an economist; a
nurse; and, an adventurer (Jake).</p>
<p>Although, on account of mateship, consenting to
participate, aware their destination is the scene of his secret
ten-year-previous humiliation, Jake is terrified – terrified of what happened
last time and terrified of what his instincts tell him is awaiting them this
time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, convinced their fate hinges on him
understanding his fascination with warzones, short of time and amidst the <i>new</i> journey, layer-by-layer,
he exhumes his rich yet traumatic past….</p>

<p>“Shoe-shine
I can do, so let me do it for you” Jonathan sing-song sang in shy pretence as,
rising from a squat, his ungainly 7-year-old gait, emaciated limbs, bare chiseled
feet and sheen of dirt and sweat gave the impression he’d just been borne of
the earth.</p>
<p>However,
failing to attract his target, slumping back down, he reached for his plastic
bottle of creek water and, as was his obsession, tipped a little on his hands.</p>
<p>“You
must keep your hand clean,” his teacher grandfather had lectured, only
partially evading the use of clipped Liberian English, “and, especially before
eating, wash between the finger!”</p>
<p>Yet,
of the three predominant threats – disease, war wounds and malnutrition – it
was the latter that currently occupied the boy’s thoughts. </p>
<p>Can
this week we buy the meat, Jonathan wondered hoping there would be something to

<p>Poor
Blessing, Jonathan thought; what in your sleep so often make your eye trickle
and your face shake?</p>
<p>Believing
her dreams wouldn't end until she defeated the enemies within them, silently

and evil were alternatively controlling her.</p>

<p>Since
his mother and Annabelle refused to speak of the journey, Jonathan had learnt

Set
in the raw Hellish throes of the Liberian Civil War, following the introduction
of a shoe-shine boy who is confronted by the invasion of his town, the novel
fast forwards a decade to the war’s 2003 historical
climax.
With
the capital and President Charles Taylor besieged from an array of triumphant
rebel forces all lusting for further spoils, only six days remain until
Taylor’s US, UN and Nigerian-brokered resign-and-depart-into-exile deadline.
Accordingly,
the tension is skyrocketing - will Taylor go voluntarily or will there be a
bloodbath?  Will there be a bloodbath
anyway?
Meanwhile,
an obscure rebel group deep in the interior (at a
place called ‘The Crossing’) unexpectedly seeks, under UN auspices, to disarm.
Requiring expatriate monitors, but with most
foreigners already evacuated, the resultant ragtag group of six consists of: a
UN professional; a doctor & spy; a boilermaker businessman; an economist; a
nurse; and, an adventurer (Jake).
Although, on account of mateship, consenting to
participate, aware their destination is the scene of his secret
ten-year-previous humiliation, Jake is terrified – terrified of what happened
last time and terrified of what his instincts tell him is awaiting them this
time.
Meanwhile, convinced their fate hinges on him
understanding his fascination with warzones, short of time and amidst the new journey, layer-by-layer,
he exhumes his rich yet traumatic past….
Admirers
of The Heart of Darkness (the inspiration for the Apocalypse Now movie) and/or
Zen & the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance may be particularly
attracted to this book. 
Every $100
contribution (and multiple) will receive an autographed numbered copy of the
book.

tools are great for this.
Thank you. 
Chapter 1 – Jonathan
“Shoe-shine
I can do, so let me do it for you” Jonathan sing-song sang in shy pretence as,
rising from a squat, his ungainly 7-year-old gait, emaciated limbs, bare chiseled
feet and sheen of dirt and sweat gave the impression he’d just been borne of
the earth.
However,
failing to attract his target, slumping back down, he reached for his plastic
bottle of creek water and, as was his obsession, tipped a little on his hands.
“You
must keep your hand clean,” his teacher grandfather had lectured, only
partially evading the use of clipped Liberian English, “and, especially before
eating, wash between the finger!”
Yet,
of the three predominant threats – disease, war wounds and malnutrition – it
was the latter that currently occupied the boy’s thoughts. 
Can
this week we buy the meat, Jonathan wondered hoping there would be something to
add to the vegetables and fruit his family variously grew and scavenged?
With
his home a rudimentary single-roomed rectangular wooden-walled hut with an
amalgamation of wood and iron pieces for a roof, a transparent plastic sheet
for a window and a curtain for a door, Jonathan lived with his mother (Joy), two
elder sisters (Annabelle and Blessing), Annabelle’s infant son (Deloitte) and
Annabelle’s husband (Johnson).
At
night, although sleeping in close proximity to the others (except for Johnson who,
employed at the rubber plantation to ‘milk’ sap, started early, finished late
and typically slept where he stopped), upon lying down, the next thing Jonathan
was usually conscious of were the lights and sounds of the morning. 
Nevertheless,
the previous evening, the boy had been roused by Blessing’s murmurings.
Straining
upright from his sleeping position on the wooden floor, drawing his knees into
his chest and arm-locking them in; the boy’s gaze had been drawn to the dim
wisps of moonlight wandering through four closely netted cracks in the hut’s side.
‘The
night light’ be so brave, Jonathan observed feeling his usual camaraderie with
the moon; even of the dark it not afraid! 
Yes, other than our loving Lord Jesus, must not the Moon God be the
greatest of all spirit? 
Attracted
by the sound of a faint moan squeezing from Blessing’s lips, gazing upon his
sister’s ever-so-faintly illuminated face, the boy caught a glimpse of moisture
glinting from the corner of one of her eyes.
Unless
you the baby, he noted, there no purpose to crying – no thing to be gained for
the effort lost.
With
her eyelids parting to reveal slivers of partially eclipsed moons, which
mirrored light from the great hanging rock itself, though at first assuming
she’d awoken, he quickly realized she was battling foes from ‘the other world’. 
Poor
Blessing, Jonathan thought; what in your sleep so often make your eye trickle
and your face shake?
Believing
her dreams wouldn't end until she defeated the enemies within them, silently
wishing her victorious, he watched as, tossing-and-turning in-and-out of the moon’s
silver rays, the shifting light and shadows seemed to suggest forces of good
and evil were alternatively controlling her.
What
you dream of, Jonathan bleakly questioned again?  Is it ‘the great journey’ of our family?  
More
than seven years previous, while Jonathan was still in his mother’s womb, their
village had been attacked and his father and two brothers never heard of
again.  
With
the rest of the family escaping, walking for days through the jungle-clad
mountains, they’d finally arrived in his mother’s hometown of Harrington,

<div>Caffeine is nature's performance-enhancing drug, but consuming caffeine can be a downer. You're probably already painfully aware of the drawbacks of typical caffeine products:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Coffee: Home-brewed takes time, coffee shops are expensive; your pearly whites eventually look like the ""before"" mouth in a teeth whitening commercial; you blow your big moment in an important meeting because you're focusing on not peeing your pants.</li>
<li>Energy drinks: Expensive; tastes like chemicals because it's made from a lot of chemicals; contains a mountain of sugar or artificial sweeteners; people might mistake you for an X-Games groupie.</li>
<li>
<span>5 Hour Energy: Tastes so bad, it's </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k7UgF71fD4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">marketed as a selling point</a><span>; More expensive than angel tears on a per-ounce basis (shots cost up to $5 each).</span>
</li>
<li>Caffeine tablets: Cheap, but with mediocre results; pressed-tablet delivery format may contain buffers and stabilizers, and may be slower-acting. Plus, plain-caffeine formula is less effective than energy blends at providing long-lasting, sustained energy.</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So what's the alternative? <b>Good Morning Pill Liquicaff.</b>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>We're Perfect Day Nutrition, and since 2011, we've been making energy vitamin supplements to provide people with the energy they need without assaulting their wallets. Our first product was the brainchild of two college roommates who loved (and needed) caffeine, but wanted to spend money on beer, not energy drinks.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Fast forward 3 years: we've sold millions of capsules of our Original and Turbo (extra strength) formulas, but we're about to further improve the caffeine game by launching our third product, the GMP Liquicaff. We've taken everything we've learned from our first two products to formulate the best energy supplement on the market. So what makes the new GMP Liquicaff so special?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Liquid-capsule delivery format: We're the first company to put liquid caffeine in a pill, providing the fast-acting properties of liquid in a quick, easy, no-taste, no-calorie format. Plus, the sip of water you take to wash down a GMP Liquicaff won't have you running to the bathroom during a meeting or pulling over at the next rest stop.</li>
<li><span>More money in your pocket - The GMP Liquicaff costs between 20 and 40 cents per serving (depending on bottle size). That's barely more than a plain pressed-caffeine tablet, and up to 95% cheaper than your morning coffee, energy drink, or energy shot. Substituting one GMP Liquicaff per day (versus $3 for a typical energy beverage) can save you over $1,000 per year.</span></li>
<li>Cutting-edge formula providing added benefits: More than just caffeine (which comes from natural sources), GMP Liquicaff's liquefied formula includes four powerful herbal extracts to provide enhanced energy, metabolic, and mental benefits:</li>
</ul>
<span><ol>
<li>
<span><b>Guarana seed extract</b></span><span> - natural source of caffeine, potentially providing additional weight management beneﬁts** </span>
</li>
<li>
<span><b>Green Tea Leaf Extract</b></span><span> - natural source of caffeine and an antioxidant, valued in Asia for providing many health beneﬁts**</span>
</li>
<li>
<span><b>Yerba mate</b></span><span> - trusted South American herb with health beneﬁts that may include increased energy and focus, weight-management, and mood improvement** </span>
</li>
<li>
<span><b>Elutherococcus senticosus</b></span><span> - trusted Asian herb that may promote increased endurance, memory/learning improvement, and may provide immunologic effects** </span>

<ul>
<li>""...These pills go further than just energy and concentration, which they offer in spades. They actually give me a sense of well being.

<br/>
</div></span>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Why we're using IndieGoGo</h3>
<div>We've taken to IndieGoGo to launch the new smaller 60-count bottle of our GMP Liquicaff. We've been selling 250-count bottles since early 2014 with a great response from long-time Good Morning Pill customers and new users alike, but not everyone wants to buy a year's supply of a product at once. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Beyond the smaller size, and the fun of a crowd-funding campaign, we hope this campaign will allow us to scale up our business further. Like Amazon.com (or a less-naughty Wal-Mart), we believe in passing along our incremental savings to the consumer - that means that higher volumes for us equals cheaper products for you. In that spirit of savings, the products in this campaign are offered at prices at least 20% lower than our Amazon.com listings (and shipping is free!).</div>

</div></div>","Improving Caffeine: Introducing GMP Liquicaff.
Caffeine is nature's performance-enhancing drug, but consuming caffeine can be a downer. You're probably already painfully aware of the drawbacks of typical caffeine products:


Coffee: Home-brewed takes time, coffee shops are expensive; your pearly whites eventually look like the ""before"" mouth in a teeth whitening commercial; you blow your big moment in an important meeting because you're focusing on not peeing your pants.
Energy drinks: Expensive; tastes like chemicals because it's made from a lot of chemicals; contains a mountain of sugar or artificial sweeteners; people might mistake you for an X-Games groupie.

5 Hour Energy: Tastes so bad, it's marketed as a selling point; More expensive than angel tears on a per-ounce basis (shots cost up to $5 each).

Caffeine tablets: Cheap, but with mediocre results; pressed-tablet delivery format may contain buffers and stabilizers, and may be slower-acting. Plus, plain-caffeine formula is less effective than energy blends at providing long-lasting, sustained energy.


So what's the alternative? Good Morning Pill Liquicaff.



We're Perfect Day Nutrition, and since 2011, we've been making energy vitamin supplements to provide people with the energy they need without assaulting their wallets. Our first product was the brainchild of two college roommates who loved (and needed) caffeine, but wanted to spend money on beer, not energy drinks.

Fast forward 3 years: we've sold millions of capsules of our Original and Turbo (extra strength) formulas, but we're about to further improve the caffeine game by launching our third product, the GMP Liquicaff. We've taken everything we've learned from our first two products to formulate the best energy supplement on the market. So what makes the new GMP Liquicaff so special?



Liquid-capsule delivery format: We're the first company to put liquid caffeine in a pill, providing the fast-acting properties of liquid in a quick, easy, no-taste, no-calorie format. Plus, the sip of water you take to wash down a GMP Liquicaff won't have you running to the bathroom during a meeting or pulling over at the next rest stop.
More money in your pocket - The GMP Liquicaff costs between 20 and 40 cents per serving (depending on bottle size). That's barely more than a plain pressed-caffeine tablet, and up to 95% cheaper than your morning coffee, energy drink, or energy shot. Substituting one GMP Liquicaff per day (versus $3 for a typical energy beverage) can save you over $1,000 per year.
Cutting-edge formula providing added benefits: More than just caffeine (which comes from natural sources), GMP Liquicaff's liquefied formula includes four powerful herbal extracts to provide enhanced energy, metabolic, and mental benefits:



Guarana seed extract - natural source of caffeine, potentially providing additional weight management beneﬁts** 


Green Tea Leaf Extract - natural source of caffeine and an antioxidant, valued in Asia for providing many health beneﬁts**


Yerba mate - trusted South American herb with health beneﬁts that may include increased energy and focus, weight-management, and mood improvement** 


Elutherococcus senticosus - trusted Asian herb that may promote increased endurance, memory/learning improvement, and may provide immunologic effects** 










What our customers say about our products

""...These pills go further than just energy and concentration, which they offer in spades. They actually give me a sense of well being. As someone who grew up taking Adderall daily for school, only to quit later in life, I find the Good Morning Pill to be a healthier, safer, and more manageable alternative."" - Matthew, Amazon reviewer, on our original Good Morning Pill

""...This product helped me stop drinking coffee. I'm a past ""Starbucks Guy."" Everyday spending $3 dollars. I can feel the Caffeine when I take this and I feel more awake and ready for any question you can through at me. With problem solving this is a great tool. For about 33 cents a pill... I seriously win on this one. Recommend for a college student and business professional."" - T. Arnold, Amazon reviewer, on our Good Morning Pill Turbo

""The pill gives me the boost to get going in the morning. The caffeine isn't over powering and there is no jitters associated with the caffeine, just a lift. I love it."" - Susie, Amazon reviewer, on our Good Morning Pill Turbo







   Why we're using IndieGoGo
We've taken to IndieGoGo to launch the new smaller 60-count bottle of our GMP Liquicaff. We've been selling 250-count bottles since early 2014 with a great response from long-time Good Morning Pill customers and new users alike, but not everyone wants to buy a year's supply of a product at once. 

Beyond the smaller size, and the fun of a crowd-funding campaign, we hope this campaign will allow us to scale up our business further. Like Amazon.com (or a less-naughty Wal-Mart), we believe in passing along our incremental savings to the consumer - that means that higher volumes for us equals cheaper products for you. In that spirit of savings, the products in this campaign are offered at prices at least 20% lower than our Amazon.com listings (and shipping is free!).

We're also hopeful that any attention generated by this campaign may help us make inroads with brick & mortar and online retailers, allowing us to bring our product (and the associated savings!) to many more potential customers that we do not yet reach.

Lastly, we have some crazy new product ideas in the pipeline. They'll probably hit the market eventually even without any extra IndieGoGo boost, but funds from this project will allow us to innovate faster and farther than we otherwise would.


  The Impact Let's be real - a caffeine supplement isn't going to save the world. But here are the impacts and implications GMP Liquicaff has for you, America, and the planet: You: 
Save up to $1,000 per year versus the cost of energy drinks, coffee, or shots
Save one day of your life each year avoiding the Starbucks or convenience store checkout line (at 4 minutes per day, every day)
Keep your teeth white, and keep your bladder empty
Get an awesome boost of energy to power you through your day
America:Support small business! Beyond just us (Perfect Day Nutrition), you'll be helping our manufacturers, two lovely businesses based in Pittsburgh, PA and Farmingdale, NY (Long Island)
The World!:
Coffee, energy drinks and energy shots waste a lot of resources - water, metal, and plastic - and result in litter in our streets and trash in our landfills. Choosing the GMP is a small way to help reduce such waste.  

  Risks & Challenges:
Not many - we've been selling our Original formula since 2011, our Turbo formula since 2012, and our Liquicaff formula since early 2014, and our customers love our products and value our customer support. 
However, if the campaign is extremely successful, there may be some delay in shipment. (If you'd like to get product immediately, please support this project by selecting an Amazon coupon code reward - your order will ship quickly & hassle free, backed up by Amazon's world-class logistics.)


  Other Ways You Can Help Spread the word! Not everyone loves caffeine, or some people just prefer a morning coffee, afternoon Monster or a Red Bull at a nightclub. That's fine (we're partial to Dunkin when we drink coffee, and sometimes a Monster and vodka is necessary to keep the night going) - but please feel free to help us out by spreading the word to your caffeine tablet-taking friend that there's a better alternative out there.

In Iraq, I spent months in some of the deadliest, most-contested areas of the country, places like Fallujah, Haditha, and the Dora neighborhood of Baghdad.

<h1><strong>So wait, aren't there already like a million books about PTSD?</strong></h1>
<p>Yep, in fact, there are a lot of PTSD books out there, but most of them zero in on one specific area of traumatic stress, e.g. an exciting new treatment, or one person's journey through it. PTSD is a complex condition, and unfortunately, most people who study it are so busy that they don't usually talk with people outside of their individual discipline. Psychiatrists don't talk to historians, victims’ advocates don't talk to poets, neuroscientists don't talk to Afghanistan veterans. My goal with <em>The Evil Hours</em> is to bring all these voices together in a single volume and show more fully what PTSD is—what causes it, what it's like to live with it, and how it changes what we know about human identity.</p>
<p>One of the little known facts about PTSD is that it wasn't acknowledged by psychiatry until 1980. The fight to have it officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association was the culmination of a decade-long campaign by a group of anti-Vietnam War veterans and activist psychiatrists. This group—Vietnam Veterans Against the War—fought against widespread criticism from veterans of other wars and the Nixon administration, which mounted an intensive surveillance and intimidation campaign against them. Drawing on new information gleaned from interviews and the archives of the Nixon Presidential library, <em>The Evil Hours</em> will tell their story for the first time.</p>
<p>Since 1980, scientific research into post-traumatic stress has exploded and our understanding of what causes it and how to treat it has grown exponentially. Today, PTSD has practically become the international lingua franca of human suffering.</p>
<p><em>The Evil Hours</em><span> is under contract with Houghton Mifflin, a US publisher, and will be released in Fall 2014.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 2em;"">Wow, this whole thing sounds like a huge downer, why should I contribute?</strong></p>
<p>You should contribute because chances are good that you know someone with PTSD, and a thoughtful, well-researched book on the subject can help to change the conversation. And also because PTSD is everywhere in our culture right now: in our movies, in the way we talk (""Dude, I think I just had a flashback""), in the way we think about stories and time and personhood.</p>
<p>PTSD has always been with us, but with the increased interest and funding generated by the War on Terror, we’re living in a golden age of trauma research, one that our tax dollars pay for and about which the average citizen knows almost nothing. That’s why a book like this is so important right <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>I have completed 80% of the research required to write this book. However, because of the scope of the project and delays in navigating the labyrinth of the Veterans Administration, the fact-finding process has taken longer than I originally anticipated. (As the sister of one Iraq veteran said to me, ""Dealing with the VA is like growing orchids."") Your contribution will help me complete <em>The Evil Hours</em>.</p>
<h1><strong>Where Will My Money Go?</strong></h1>
<p>Your contribution will cover research expenses like travel and lodging, interview transcription, interview tape duplication (archival tapes are incredibly expensive), research book purchases, academic journal subscriptions, marketing, photocopies, office supplies, a scientific proofreader, and my ""Friends of the UCSD Library"" card privileges. If we raise enough money, I hope to travel to the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies Conference in Philadelphia in November 2013, and possibly even to Israel to visit with the clinicians at NATAL, the Israeli PTSD nonprofit, and the UN Relief &amp; Works Agency in Gaza.</p></div>","Every war story is a ghost story. -Iraq veteran

However, because of the scope of the project and delays in navigating the labyrinth of the Veterans Administration, the fact-finding process has taken longer than I originally anticipated. (As the sister of one Iraq veteran said to me, ""Dealing with the VA is like growing orchids."") Your contribution will help me complete The Evil Hours.
Where Will My Money Go?
Your contribution will cover research expenses like travel and lodging, interview transcription, interview tape duplication (archival tapes are incredibly expensive), research book purchases, academic journal subscriptions, marketing, photocopies, office supplies, a scientific proofreader, and my ""Friends of the UCSD Library"" card privileges. If we raise enough money, I hope to travel to the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies Conference in Philadelphia in November 2013, and possibly even to Israel to visit with the clinicians at NATAL, the Israeli PTSD nonprofit, and the UN Relief & Works Agency in Gaza.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p><span>To help as many mothers as I can by giving away as many copies of my book: </span></p>
<p><span>Work Women Want: Work at Home or Go Part-Time as possible.</span></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p><span><em>What the book is about:</em><br/></span></p>
<p><span>After the birth of my daughter, I kept meeting other mothers who wanted to work at home. They were asking the same questions I had. How can I be there for my children and still make decent money? How can I work at home or go part-time? Which one is right for me? In my book <em>Work Women Want </em>I set out to find them an answer. </span></p>
<p><span>I share my own journey making decent money from home, as well as my experience working part-time. I also share the stories of the women I interviewed who make family friendly money. More Importantly, in the book I help you find the right work for you.</span></p>
<p>I have spent the last nine months interviewing women and writing my book <em>Work Women Want.</em> I am self-publishing the book because that's what I do. I haven't even approached a traditional publisher. I have enough of my own money to pay for an eagle eye editor and a fabulous graphic designer. The book will be released May 1st 2013.</p>
<p><strong><em>What I Need Help With:</em></strong></p>
<p>But I would like to help as many other mothers as I can: I would like to give away 2000 copies with 500 print copies and 1500 e-book copies making up that total number. (Honestly I would love to giveaway even more than that!) </p>
<p><span>Printing and posting 500 print copies of the book isn't cheap and it isn't the kind of money I have. It will cost about about $22 a book to print it and post it around the world. Sending e-books for all the different e-readers out there is so much cheaper but still does have a small cost attached.</span></p>
<p><span>I will use all the money raised here to send out free books to mothers. How will I choose the women who get them? One of the perks I'm offering here is a copy of the book so of course you will be first. Next I will give them to the people who subscribe to my blog at <a href=""http://www.workwomenwant.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.workwomenwant.com</a> will get one and then I will contact  mommy bloggers to see if their subscribers would like a copy.</span></p>

The Impact
Once you have kids there are a lot of tough decisions that have to be made. A lot of parents - both moms and dads - give up their careers and don't make much money so they can be there for their children. I didn't write this book for every mother or every woman. I wrote it for the moms who are at home with their kids by choice or by chance and who still want and need to make some money. I want to help those women find ways to make some money and live the life they want for them and their children.
By donating you can help mothers do what sometimes seem impossible: have the time to take the kids to the playground and be there to pick them up after school but still make money and put food on the table.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate right now, no worries! Spread the word to your friends and family. Tell any parents you know who may be keen to work out how to make money at home or go part-time. 
Email your friends, family, any parents you know.

<h2><strong>Meet SNURTLE!</strong></h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Baruch Inbar and I’m an artist and a writer from Los Angeles. <strong>SNURTLE</strong> is my first children’s book that I’ve written and illustrated. I have been dreaming for a long time to publish my first children’s book, and now it’s time has come!</p>
<p><img alt=""Snurtle 1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://behance.vo.llnwd.net/profiles16/285355/projects/7675667/33e3c43d1b99e7e7561a804a233a12ff.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Snurtle and fam""/></p>
<h2><strong>About The Book</strong></h2>
<p><strong>SNURTLE</strong> is the story of a very unusual character who is born to a mom snail and a dad turtle, into a strict and rigid society that does not embrace diversity and uniqueness. Therefore, <strong>SNURTLE</strong> and his parents are forced to leave their home and life behind, and embark on an epic adventure on their search for a new home and a loving community, that will love and accept them the way they are. Will they succeed? You can find out when you read the book!</p>
<p>I wrote this book, because I felt that there is a little <strong>SNURTLE</strong> deep inside each and every one of us – that part that wants to be loved and accepted for our uniqueness, no matter how strange or weird we may think we are…A message that goes well for both children and adults.</p>
<p>The book features spectacular 22 full color illustrations, and is written in whimsical, humorous and fun rhymes that the entire family will enjoy, including the in laws! ;0)</p>

<h2><strong>What I Offer &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>I am offering you the opportunity to contribute and take part in the first <strong>LIMITED</strong> edition printing of the book in English, of 10,000 copies. I am committed to printing this book with the highest integrity and best quality I can! This first hard cover edition run of <strong>SNURTLE</strong> will be printed in the U.S, on a high quality, long lasting and durable paper.</p>

<p>My printing costs are quoted at $5.3 per book - which comes to total of $53,000 + tax (appx. $57,800) to print 10,000 copies of <strong>SNURTLE</strong>, on top notch <strong>art quality</strong>, archival hard cover 12” x 12” format. The rest of the funds that will remain after paying Indiegogo their share (appx. $5,000 fee) will be used to cover the costs of mailing and other expenses of the perks disbursement, promotion and online marketing of the book, sales and distribution and of the book online as well as other avenues such as book fairs, festivals and tradeshows.</p>
<p>If you look at the perks, you are getting a share and great investment in a really cool intellectual peoperty that will grow expedentially and turn into a global phonomena. Whether you contribute $5, or more, you are getting really cool stuff signed by yours very truly! </p>
<h2><strong>But here is the biggest perk you get if you contribute $25 or more:</strong></h2>
<p>This is the <strong>ONLY</strong> first edition of the book that will be ever printed, numbered and signed by me. Once the book gets momentum, there is the likelihood that it will be picked up by a major publisher and reprinted in mass production. If you are one of the lucky ones who will get a first edition signed copy by me, you will own a valuable art collectible piece forever that will be worth much more down the road. A pretty good investment don't you think?...</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>This is just the beginning! The funding will be used to get the books out there into the world, and provided that we succeed at getting over-compensated, the extra money will be used to print additional books in other languages (already translated into Hebrew and Russian), and even turn <strong>SNURTLE</strong> into an interactive iPad book, animated film, online game, plush toys, clothing line and other cool stuff!</p>
<p>My commitement is to offer <strong>YOU</strong>, my dear backers a first exclusive preview and opportunity to take part in any new possibilities that will spring out of the book, and that way you will continue to grow your shares in this property. We are ALL making this happen together, and I am honored to give you a share in the success of <strong>SNURTLE </strong>as it grows!</p>
<p>Also, as stated in my video: after fulfilling the perks to you all, for each and every book I wil sell, I will donate one book to a foster child through the <strong>BLESS THE CHILDREN Project</strong> charitable foundation. This is super important to me, because I was a foster child myself, and I know how important the message of <strong>SNURTLE</strong> is for these kids...</p>

<h3>Where We Go When All We Were Is Gone</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><em>As we proceeded through the serpentine inner loggia, a glowing passage spiraling towards the center of the complex, Reo and I stopped to gaze up at nearly every column––sculptured monoliths of regal men in robes and jewels, tribesman with ornate feathered headdresses, muscular warriors clad in animal skins holding shields at their feet, Roman centurions, Greek philosphers, a young man with a swastika on his uniform carrying a rifle. Did these people come to this place? I wondered. Were the builders still around to add onto the complex as our civilization grew? Perhaps the walls around us were alive in some way, aware of the world above, sprouting pyramids, adobe villages, and modern skyscrapers so gargatuan that they almost defied the world above. </em></p>
<p>~</p>
<p><em>I watched my teenage daughter sleep via the spycam behind her dresser mirror. I waited for it, sitting in my locked office downstairs. It didn’t happen every night but, when it did, it began just after her eyes began to flit like frightened houseflies. She appeared to be fast asleep the whole time, unaware of what was happening to her, although I knew the exact opposite to be true. Her olive skin punctuated with the scars of a tomboyish childhood began to fade––erase until her skin had become a gelatinous membrane like the flesh of a jellyfish. The transformation radiated from her feet, creeping up her legs and torso in a sinuous path. Organs became masses of light. The heart, a tiny pulsar, streaming out rivulets of blood throughout her body the color of the aurora. </em></p>
<p><em><br/></em></p>
<h3><em>Summary</em></h3>
<p>In the not too distant future, Reo, the young daughter of two evolutionary geneticists, accompanies her parents on an expedition in the Amazon. Deep within an unexplored cave network, a massive temple complex that predates humanity glows in the darkness. It is here, surrounded by impossibly ancient colonnades and walls adorned with carvings of our history, that Reo dies, falling through brittle ground and into the primordial foundation of the temple. </p>
<p>But years later, she is still alive, and only her father knows what is happening to her, how his daughter left the cave where he found her lifeless body.

As we proceeded through the serpentine inner loggia, a glowing passage spiraling towards the center of the complex, Reo and I stopped to gaze up at nearly every column––sculptured monoliths of regal men in robes and jewels, tribesman with ornate feathered headdresses, muscular warriors clad in animal skins holding shields at their feet, Roman centurions, Greek philosphers, a young man with a swastika on his uniform carrying a rifle. Did these people come to this place? I wondered. Were the builders still around to add onto the complex as our civilization grew? Perhaps the walls around us were alive in some way, aware of the world above, sprouting pyramids, adobe villages, and modern skyscrapers so gargatuan that they almost defied the world above. 
~
I watched my teenage daughter sleep via the spycam behind her dresser mirror. I waited for it, sitting in my locked office downstairs. It didn’t happen every night but, when it did, it began just after her eyes began to flit like frightened houseflies. She appeared to be fast asleep the whole time, unaware of what was happening to her, although I knew the exact opposite to be true. Her olive skin punctuated with the scars of a tomboyish childhood began to fade––erase until her skin had become a gelatinous membrane like the flesh of a jellyfish. The transformation radiated from her feet, creeping up her legs and torso in a sinuous path. Organs became masses of light. The heart, a tiny pulsar, streaming out rivulets of blood throughout her body the color of the aurora. 

Summary
In the not too distant future, Reo, the young daughter of two evolutionary geneticists, accompanies her parents on an expedition in the Amazon. Deep within an unexplored cave network, a massive temple complex that predates humanity glows in the darkness. It is here, surrounded by impossibly ancient colonnades and walls adorned with carvings of our history, that Reo dies, falling through brittle ground and into the primordial foundation of the temple. 
But years later, she is still alive, and only her father knows what is happening to her, how his daughter left the cave where he found her lifeless body. Meanwhile, the girl's mother conducts experiments on a history-altering discovery made in the caves where her daughter, unbeknownst to her, died, an experiment with ramifications which could change what it means to be human. 
What follows is a journey of one girl trying to discover who she is and where she fits into the world––during high school as the world is torn apart by failing ecosystems and governments, in the timeless consciousness of dreams and death, through post-apocalyptic streets, and in the back alleys of underground settlements.
This is a story of the fall and rebirth of family, self, and civilization, and the choices one girl makes in trying to give her family and the world a second chance.

<p><em>We Believe Censorship Is Wrong ...</em><br/>In January of 2011, a censored version of the Mark Twain classic, “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” was announced. The publisher replaced the controversial 'n' word with the word 'slave' in an effort to appear more politically correct.</p>

We released the first draft of the manuscript last year as an ebook on Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble.

<h2><strong>Standard Edition Of Survivors &amp; Bandits</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Survivors &amp; Bandits is a full length novel set in the world of DayZ. It’s a work of fiction that is a culmination of both my experiences and the experiences of people I’ve interviewed in DayZ. The first draft is currently at 95,000 words with the Act 1 sample provided coming in at 28,000 words – so it’s going to be big! I’ve been a writer for over seventeen years - writing novels, screenplays and television. This is my first Zombie fiction novel which my wife hopes will finally purge my constant discussions about the impending zombie apocalypse.</p>
<p>Cherno Journo is my DayZ ingame name and my pen name for this project. This is a standard edition of the DayZ novel without any bells and whistles unlike the previous campaign for the special edition.</p>
<p>The eBook version of Survivors &amp; Bandits will be out before Christmas and will be a great gift for any DayZ fan. At this stage I can’t confirm a release date for the print versions as that will depend on contributor numbers and the printer’s deadlines. I know that if I wasn’t writing it I’d love it as a Christmas present so I’ll try my hardest to get all perks out for Christmas.</p>
<h2><strong>Samples</strong></h2>
<p>Downloadable samples of the first 120 pages for all major eBook readers can be found here. If your format isn't here then please let me know - I have tried to cover as many as possible.</p>

<p>Although underrated in DayZ, the Empty Tin Can does allow you to distract Zeds.  Throw enough of them and you can kill one.

<h2><strong>So hurry up and take my money</strong></h2>
<p>Woah, not so fast! I want to give you something for free first. I’ve worked with my editor of over ten years on the first Act of the novel.

The links are at the top and in the next section and I’ve covered off all the major eBook formats. If there’s a different format you’d like then let me know and I’ll see if I can create it for you.</p>
<p>There are just three things to remember with the free sample;</p>
<p>- It’s only a draft so anything could change - although I do doubt it as the whole first draft novel is done, but the thing about DayZ is that it’s brutal. I might need to kill off existing characters and introduce some new characters.</p>
<p> - It’s the first Act. There is a lot of getting to know the characters. If you don’t know them then you can’t care about them, so I need to give you their backstory. Lots of the action, the vehicles and the really messed up stuff that DayZ is known for occurs in the second and third Acts.</p>
<p> - It’s only the first 120 pages and full of spoilers. Act 1 ends on a small climax but the story is far from resolved and many questions are left unanswered. I recommend you read as much as you need to make a decision and then stop - save the surprises for your final read of the whole novel. </p>

<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>Matthew 4</strong> – As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.” At once they left their nets and followed him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Fuse Concerts</strong> was founded by Brian and Andrea Sawyer for the sole purpose to expand the Kingdom of God through the gifts of song and spoken word. The ministry is completely, top to bottom, staffed by volunteers with NO salaries.  It is a not-for-profit organization (5013c has been submitted and awaiting approval). All of the financial risk falls directly onto Brian and Andrea. Why are they doing this? Simply put, because God asked them to. In Matthew God asked Peter and Andrew to drop your nets and follow Him.

</div></div>","Summary
Matthew 4 – As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.” At once they left their nets and followed him.
Fuse Concerts was founded by Brian and Andrea Sawyer for the sole purpose to expand the Kingdom of God through the gifts of song and spoken word. The ministry is completely, top to bottom, staffed by volunteers with NO salaries.  It is a not-for-profit organization (5013c has been submitted and awaiting approval). All of the financial risk falls directly onto Brian and Andrea. Why are they doing this? Simply put, because God asked them to. In Matthew God asked Peter and Andrew to drop your nets and follow Him. They didn’t say, let me pray about it or can I get back to you in a few days?  No, they IMMEDIATELY dropped their nets and followed Jesus. This is what Brian and Andrea have done with Fuse Christian Concerts. They are walking out their faith.
What We Need & What You Get

<h3>Martial Arts and Budo</h3>
<p>I love the martial arts, and I have a particular passion for
Japanese martial arts, or budo. I've been doing budo, both modern and
classical, in the US and Japan,  for 30 years. Even with the internet
though, really good information on the traditions, training and
thinking in martial arts is hard to find. 
</p>
<p>After 3 decades training in the US and Japan doing Kodokan Judo,
Shinto Muso Ryu Jo, Muso Jikiden Eishin Ryu Iai and Shinto Hatakage
Ryu Iai Heiho, I've started to explore the world of martial arts
practice though in my writings. My goal with this campaign is to
publish an anthology of essays that will be be worth reading for
anyone who is interested in martial arts, whether beginning student
or seasoned veteran. I want
to help people find quality information about the martial arts.I love
budo and believe martial arts training can benefit anyone. I want to
share the beauty and power and incredible potential for development
that martial arts practice offers. 
</p>
<p>Contributing to this project will make solid, accurate information
about the martial arts available to help counter the wealth of garage
circulating on the internet. The essays provide more than just
answers. They are built around good questions to ask yourself when
exploring the martial arts and their meaning. What is the purpose of
martial arts practice? What qualities are we trying to develop in our
arts and in ourselves?</p>

<p>I'm a military veteran who attended the University of California at Berkeley on an Air Force ROTC scholarship. After graduating and becoming a military officer, I love being part of an aircrew and later an instructor navigator. I have lived on and visited four continents. As I speak at events around the country, I am often asked about that part of my life. My three young children and their friends also love to hear the stories of my life in the military.  <br/><br/> My team and I have created an Amazon bestseller, a book that is now in the process of securing a production deal to become a documentary. It also received three different honors at the International Latino Book Awards in New York City. This Amazon bestseller is titled ""Latinnovating: Green American Jobs and the Latinos Creating Them."" This book was launched in 2011 at Stanford University at the Silicon Valley Latino Leadership Summit. This first book has led to many invitations to speak around the country. It has helped me build a huge network of supporters of the unique content produced by our small publishing company, Gracefully Global Group LLC. This will be our first children's book!</p>
<p>With a career as a professional product marketer in my tool belt, I look forward to leading the strong marketing push for ""Good Night Captain Mama"" as I have done for <em>Latinnovating.</em> As the mother of three who all attended our local Parent Participation Preschool where I worked once a week, I have seven years of direct experience reading to children ages three through six, the intended audience for this book. We have set up a basic website for this new book that you can see here:  <a href=""http://www.goodnightcaptainmama.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.goodnightcaptainmama.com/</a> My author biography is here: <a href=""http://www.latinnovating.com/index.php?p=graciela-tiscareno-sato"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.latinnovating.com/index.php?p=graciela-tiscareno-sato</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME</strong> --Getting this first children’s book funded is important to me for three reasons: </p>
<p>First, this book (and the series I’ve planned out) was inspired by a conversation with my preschool-aged son the first time he saw me wearing my military flight suit. It was the night before a Veterans Day event at his sisters’ elementary school. My curious child ripped the Velcro-attached patches from my flight suit one at a time, and asked about the meaning of each. As I answered his questions in the simplest language possible, I wondered how many other children share his curiosity about the colorful military uniforms and insignia they see on TV, at parades, on military installations and elsewhere. When he said “Good Night Captain Mama,” I knew I had to write this book.</p>
<p>Second, I researched available books for children about military service and found there are hardly any that speak to the youngest child, the preschool to kindergarten population. I see a need for this book in our nation’s preschools and kindergarten classrooms, so that Veterans Day means something to them besides a day off.</p>
<p>As one of the few Latinas that has ever worn a military flight suit in service to this nation, I want to use this book to shine a bright spotlight on the many Latinas serving in today’s military. They must be recognized for their service and sacrifice, because they can then serve as much-needed role models for today’s modern young Latinas</p>
<p>The books I did find during my research were mostly NOT written by veterans. I feel very strongly that a book written by a mother who is also a veteran would sell very well, because it simply is more authentic coming from first-hand experience. My hope is that in sharing the 800 words of this children's book with young kids, they can begin to appreciate the unique pride associated with military service in the USA.</p>
<p>Lastly, applying lessons learned from creating and launching our first book, we want to have all production costs funded ahead of launch for our first children’s book. These startup funds will cover the cost of hiring the illustrator, the layout and design team, the initial print run and very importantly, the marketing campaign and launch tour which will be national in scope. We are planning to launch this unique children’s book in Washington D.C. at an important military memorial on a key holiday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU ARE HELPING TO CREATE AS A SUPPORTER</strong> --By funding this campaign, you will bring an important contribution to our nation’s preschools, kindergarten classrooms and homes. For subsequent years as the children celebrate Veterans Day, teachers and parents will have a sweet, simple, highly visual story to tell through the <em>Good Night Captain Mama</em> book you are helping to create!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT IF WE DON’T REACH THE ENTIRE GOAL? </strong>–Should we fall short of the $40,000 goal, the funds we will receive will pay for all production costs (cost of illustrations, cover design, layout, proofs, etc) so that a physical product will come to exist. We will simply order a smaller initial print run of books and start taking preorders sooner to be able to produce more books to get into national distribution with existing wholesale partners. We will scale down our launch tour plans to fit the smaller budget.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong>--If you help fund Captain Mama, you’ll be joining a winning team. See, I’m not a newbie author anymore; we have created an Amazon bestseller, a book that is now in the process of securing a production deal to become a documentary AND a three-time award winner at the International Latino Book Awards in New York City. We will not rest until this book too becomes a bestseller and an award winner. YOU will know that you were there in the very beginning making it all possible! If you’ve never had bragging rights that you helped to fund a bestselling, award-winning book, here’s your chance!</p>

We have set up a basic website for this new book that you can see here:  http://www.goodnightcaptainmama.com/ My author biography is here: http://www.latinnovating.com/index.php?p=graciela-tiscareno-sato
 
WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME --Getting this first children’s book funded is important to me for three reasons: 
First, this book (and the series I’ve planned out) was inspired by a conversation with my preschool-aged son the first time he saw me wearing my military flight suit. It was the night before a Veterans Day event at his sisters’ elementary school. My curious child ripped the Velcro-attached patches from my flight suit one at a time, and asked about the meaning of each. As I answered his questions in the simplest language possible, I wondered how many other children share his curiosity about the colorful military uniforms and insignia they see on TV, at parades, on military installations and elsewhere. When he said “Good Night Captain Mama,” I knew I had to write this book.
Second, I researched available books for children about military service and found there are hardly any that speak to the youngest child, the preschool to kindergarten population. I see a need for this book in our nation’s preschools and kindergarten classrooms, so that Veterans Day means something to them besides a day off.
As one of the few Latinas that has ever worn a military flight suit in service to this nation, I want to use this book to shine a bright spotlight on the many Latinas serving in today’s military. They must be recognized for their service and sacrifice, because they can then serve as much-needed role models for today’s modern young Latinas
The books I did find during my research were mostly NOT written by veterans. I feel very strongly that a book written by a mother who is also a veteran would sell very well, because it simply is more authentic coming from first-hand experience. My hope is that in sharing the 800 words of this children's book with young kids, they can begin to appreciate the unique pride associated with military service in the USA.
Lastly, applying lessons learned from creating and launching our first book, we want to have all production costs funded ahead of launch for our first children’s book. These startup funds will cover the cost of hiring the illustrator, the layout and design team, the initial print run and very importantly, the marketing campaign and launch tour which will be national in scope. We are planning to launch this unique children’s book in Washington D.C. at an important military memorial on a key holiday.
 
WHAT YOU ARE HELPING TO CREATE AS A SUPPORTER --By funding this campaign, you will bring an important contribution to our nation’s preschools, kindergarten classrooms and homes. For subsequent years as the children celebrate Veterans Day, teachers and parents will have a sweet, simple, highly visual story to tell through the Good Night Captain Mama book you are helping to create!
 
WHAT IF WE DON’T REACH THE ENTIRE GOAL? –Should we fall short of the $40,000 goal, the funds we will receive will pay for all production costs (cost of illustrations, cover design, layout, proofs, etc) so that a physical product will come to exist. We will simply order a smaller initial print run of books and start taking preorders sooner to be able to produce more books to get into national distribution with existing wholesale partners. We will scale down our launch tour plans to fit the smaller budget.
 
The Impact--If you help fund Captain Mama, you’ll be joining a winning team. See, I’m not a newbie author anymore; we have created an Amazon bestseller, a book that is now in the process of securing a production deal to become a documentary AND a three-time award winner at the International Latino Book Awards in New York City. We will not rest until this book too becomes a bestseller and an award winner. YOU will know that you were there in the very beginning making it all possible! If you’ve never had bragging rights that you helped to fund a bestselling, award-winning book, here’s your chance!

<p>This is an idea that has been close to my heart for a very long time.</p>
<p>From a personal aspect, there was a time when I never understood the concepts of mental health. It’s very easy to say or do something wrong when that understanding isn’t there. As I have grown seeing those closest to me suffer from anxiety, depression, OCD, and a whole host of other mental health issues, it has made me want to write these children’s stories to create awareness and I hope that with your help, it will be possible to spread this message as far as I am able.</p>
<p>Mental health has always been a taboo subject that people don’t seem to be willing to discuss. People don’t feel like they can open up about their issues and those that do can feel marginalised which can lead them to say nothing more. I want to be a part of the movement that’s opening up the floor and saying: “We need to start talking about this now”.</p>
<p>This is the grand scale dream.</p>
<p>A basis of understanding is needed right from our development stages. A basis that allows for both awareness of oneself and understanding of others that could be suffering. These issues need to take centre stage at an earlier level in order to break its archaic and needless taboo, allowing for an emotional and mentally aware society.</p>
<p>This collection contains 7 short stories, each aiming to open up the conversation around an aspect of mental health, from anxiety and panic disorders to depression, written in an accessible way for children (or adults) through character and story arch to hopefully encourage an enriched emotional development. These stories are written and I plan to self-publish them on the amazon kindle platform at the beginning of March. The money raised here will go towards the promotional material needed to spread the message.</p>
<p>There are battles people are going through that you may never suspect. I’ve written these stories to try and do my part for the people who are suffering. For the people that don’t think they are good enough or don’t understand what’s happening to them. For those silently coming face to face with their mortality and wondering why. I would just like to say that you are loved. You are needed. And even at your weakest, there is a strength in you that can be found when the nights look their bleakest.</p>

<h3>About the Book</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Dawkin: A Tall Tale is a science fiction western novel that takes place in 1887, in an alternate universe America. The story follows a young alien farmer and his bull mastiff who must travel across the U.S. to save the love of his life!</span></p>
<p>My name is Massimo Marchiano and I am the author of Dawkin: A Tall Tale. I wrote this book in dedication to my dog, Diesel, who passed away from cancer in 2016. I’ve always had an idea for an adventure book in my head, but it was not until after his passing the idea really started forming in my mind. I also wrote this because after growing up and seeing so many sequels, reboots, remasters and remakes, I feel that you, the reader, deserve an original story.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will have fun and discover the importance of friendship. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to escape from the real world and enjoy a wholesome story about friends trying to reach a common goal. You will learn alongside Dawkin, the titular protagonist, that the need for others is a very important one.<br/><br/>The story: In an alternate universe, arable farmland is less abundant while oil is closer to the surface, making it easier to extract and use. While this has led to technological advances, it has not made life easier for those trying to survive. In 1869, things become more difficult when an alien race known as the Void crashes on Earth. Although humans and Void get along peacefully for the most part, tensions run high between them. The story follows a young Void who loses his family in a tragic incident in his childhood. He is then saved by a human, who teaches him how to farm, survive, and live life on Earth. Eventually, the young Void names himself after the human who raised him, Dawkin. During his years at the farm, Dawkin tames the magnificent beast, Brutus, a bullmastiff who plays an important role in the story. Dawkin even falls in love with the farmer's daughter and gets his blessing to ask for her hand in marriage. But, when a mysterious tragedy occurs, he and his dog embark on an adventure of a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>​Reasons I think you will like this book!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a story of adventure, where the characters experience beauty through overcoming adversity.</li>
<li>Dog owners will love the dynamic duo that is Dawkin and his dog, Brutus.</li>
<li>The Alternate Universe setting makes the story more unique in many areas (mannerisms, clothing, geography, creatures, etc.).</li>
<li>Science Fiction fans will like the alien race, as well as their backstory.</li>
<li>Western/Frontier fans will enjoy the use of real locations, setting, and dialogue between characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dawkin: A Tall Tale speaks to dog owners and adventure lovers who understand how important the need for others is. We may think we have things under control, but in reality, we are helpless without those around us.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope that Dawkin: A Tall Tale inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are times I think I can do it all on my own, but is that really the truth in life?</li>
<li>What lengths would I go to for the people I care for? Is it really best to push away those who care for me?</li>
<li>How can we reach our own goals in life by helping those around us?</li>
</ul>
<p>I am interested in exploring and discussing these questions and more with my readers! I think these questions can open our eyes to realize the value in those around us.</p>

<h3><b>The mystery behind our new children’s book.</b></h3>
<p><b>Who’s the family</b> in that strange clip from the <i>Secret Passages</i>
show? It’s us! David and Kelly Sopp, and our boy. We have a little company
called Wry Baby, and we’re the authors of several best-selling books including <i>Safe Baby Handling Tips</i>, <i>Safe
Baby Pregnancy Tips</i>, and <i>The New
Parents Fun Book</i>. And now, we're excited to reveal our newest children's book, <b>""A Future just for You.""</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447002523/hxiw2vzrjfmwsgugtvkh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>After years of researching</b> (okay, stalking) the great
baby mystic Mysterio on his travels, we have just completed our story about the living legend. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In this enchanting picture book, we reveal how Mysterio
uses the incredible mental powers of his mind to predict children's destinies for curious parents. You’ll love turning each page of this magically illustrated tale. How
does the story end? Let’s just say that Mysterio has a prediction for YOUR child's future, too.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Perhaps you already know</b> about Mysterio from his popular, future-predicting
baby T-shirts (see the Perks below!). Or maybe you are discovering Mysterio’s mystical powers for the

Who’s the family in that strange clip from the Secret Passages
show? It’s us! David and Kelly Sopp, and our boy. We have a little company
called Wry Baby, and we’re the authors of several best-selling books including Safe Baby Handling Tips, Safe
Baby Pregnancy Tips, and The New
Parents Fun Book. And now, we're excited to reveal our newest children's book, ""A Future just for You.""

After years of researching (okay, stalking) the great
baby mystic Mysterio on his travels, we have just completed our story about the living legend. In this enchanting picture book, we reveal how Mysterio
uses the incredible mental powers of his mind to predict children's destinies for curious parents. You’ll love turning each page of this magically illustrated tale. How
does the story end? Let’s just say that Mysterio has a prediction for YOUR child's future, too.



Perhaps you already know about Mysterio from his popular, future-predicting
baby T-shirts (see the Perks below!). Or maybe you are discovering Mysterio’s mystical powers for the
very first time today. Either way, we hope you'll become a part of his story by supporting the first printing of ""A Future Just for You!""


Take a peek inside...
""A Future Just for You!"" is a 28-page paperback book featuring pen and ink illustration by David Sopp. The book was conjured up by David and Kelly and written in a whimsical, poetic style that children love. Your support helps us afford the sheet-fed, litho printing (not cheapo digital printing) of 3,000 books in the USA.








Why are successful, published authors doing a crowdfunding campaign?
Because ""A Future Just for You!"" is the debut book being published and marketed by just little ol' us. Why? We wanted greater freedom to be truly original – creating a unique story we believe folks will really enjoy. Unfortunately, small companies like ours don't have access to tons of capital like the big guys do (everything we make is completely self-funded). 
Your support supplements our first offset printing of 3,000 copies. Contributions above and beyond our
goal will be used for marketing expenses so that curious parents everywhere can
get to know the legend of Mysterio. Not to mention, discover their
child’s amazing destiny!
As if discovering your child’s destiny from an ancient manuscript conveyed by a great mystic isn’t
enough... 
Yes, there's way more. We're thanking our fun supporters (both individual fans and retailers) by offering all kinds of other exclusive, magical perks! So if you're trying to decide whether to buy a peppermint chocolate latte today or help fund our book, think no further! That latte may deliver 400 delicious calories, but it will not predict your child's amazing future!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Have I got you hooked yet?<br/>Want more?<br/>Yes!<br/>Then let's GOGO! bring this new book to market. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Today you are requested to embark on the next chapter of my self-publishing story with me. Some amazing students have already given the story of Lil' Phyllis Meets Her Book Fair Fairy an unanimous thumbs up. Also, I have there reviews written in their own hand. Lil' Phyllis seems to be the type of character readers want to see. The first book was a 32 page picture book with the story written in verse. Lil' Phyllis Meets Her Book Fair Fairy is a chapter book so it is a story told differently from the first. Hopefully, the readers can take it with them beyond their current grade level. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Wait a minute, I have go to stop to appreciate all those votes of confidence from all my original Indiegogo book project contributors from 2013. Also, I would like to take advantage of this platform, to give thanks to the Most High.  </p>
<p>Your help made ""Lil' Phyllis Loves to Laff"" really able to reach more readers. In addition, there were many teachers, librarians, moms and dads, and especially the bright enthusiastic students who have bought a copy to read, enjoyed, and share with it others. I Love you all.</p>
<p><strong>Click image to view a reading of ""Lil Phyllis Loves To Laff"".</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>This Is What's Next</strong><br/>Now let's do it again. The next project is a chapter book with about 100 pages . </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>""Lil' Phyllis Meets Her Book Fair Fairy""</strong><br/><strong><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ovgm340s2gp2dr/Lil%20PhyllisMeetsHerBookFairFairy%20%20BOOK%20PREVIEW.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Click to preview it here.​</u></a></strong></p>
<p>Because ""Lil' Phyllis Meets Her Book Fair Fairy"" is a chapter book this time around, there are three times as many pages and a lot more words. I am excited to share this original tale with a fun plot line. It has been in the works for about two years. The story is written needs , but needs a little editing work. Calling all editors!</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p><br/>Whatever money we raise, I will also add to it from my personal moneys.</p>
<p>The goal is to raise $1,355.00 in 30 days!! However, the more money raised beyond the stated goal the more books that I am able to purchase. The reader gets a greater the value . That is because each copy of the book will cost less. </p>
<p><strong>Please see the Printer's quote in the price chart below:</strong><br/>Prices 9,25% Sales <u>Tax NOT</u> Included In Prices Below</p>
<p><strong>$1,355.00 / 100 Qty. Books</strong></p>
<p>$1,731.00 / 150 Qty. Books</p>
<p>$2,313.00 / 250 Qty. Books</p>
<p>$3,525.00 / 500 Qty. Books</p>
<p>$6,145.00 / 1,000 Qty. Books</p>
<p>The way printing works is the more prints one orders, the lower the final price. This is good for two reasons. First, the more books printed the better. Second, the less money it costs even better because You get more value.</p>
<p>In the  printer's quote above, it is easy to see how the price get better the more book I have printed. <strong>$1,355.00</strong> is what we going for. But, remember, the more You all fund the better value for everyone.<br/><strong>For example</strong>, if together, we were to raise $6,145, each book would cost only about $6.<br/>That is a great improvement on $13. per book printed. And better for the readers too.<br/>The goal is to get the best quality printed book possible, yet get the best price possible for the customer. My Los Angeles based print shop provides both. Also, they give really good customer service to their clients. I want to be as transparent I can. So, I am showed You all how my printers actual quoted me for my print order for ""Lil' Phyllis Meets Her Book Fair Fairy"".</p>
<p>Wow, what a difference your contribution can make!<br/>With Contributors that are passionate about this project and believe that it's more than possible, it will be easy to publish and share my new story.</p>
<p>We have done it before, so lets do it again. But better.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The of any creative work is not always predictable. But, fortunately, I see the impact publishing and sharing my books has had almost daily because I worked with students at an elementary school in San Diego, CA for over ten years.</p>
<p>Specifically because I worked in education, I was able to see how students respond to my book.  I saw the immediate impact of my first book, ""Lil Phyllis Loves to Laff"", which was first published in 2013. The children smiled and were excited about reading it and became more interested in writing themselves. Even today, I see that my book still challenges students to think and comprehend better. Also, my book has helped teachers to reach their students in different ways. I see how teachers have applied my book's theme to their Arts Integrated Curriculum. This is important to me because part of my Special Education duties were to be in the classroom helping students develop better reading skills, habits, and a love for learning from books.</p>
<p>You can make an impact as well with a contribution to my Indiegogo crowd funded campaign. I hope you fund my next book project and help me publish, print, and distribute my chapter book, ""Lil' Phyllis Meets Her Book Fair Fairy"".</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Okay, Thanks to all you for bring to it! But if you just can not make a $ contribution ( which is completely understandable) but you still want to make an impact, here are some ways you can:</p>
<p>My book project is also seeking</p>

<li>Professional copy-editing ( If you are one or know someone how is good at it, please reach out )</li>

</ul>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p><p>Peace and Blessing Everyone.</p></div>","Short Summary
Have I got you hooked yet?Want more?Yes!Then let's GOGO! bring this new book to market. 
Today you are requested to embark on the next chapter of my self-publishing story with me. Some amazing students have already given the story of Lil' Phyllis Meets Her Book Fair Fairy an unanimous thumbs up. Also, I have there reviews written in their own hand. Lil' Phyllis seems to be the type of character readers want to see. The first book was a 32 page picture book with the story written in verse. Lil' Phyllis Meets Her Book Fair Fairy is a chapter book so it is a story told differently from the first. Hopefully, the readers can take it with them beyond their current grade level. 
 
Wait a minute, I have go to stop to appreciate all those votes of confidence from all my original Indiegogo book project contributors from 2013. Also, I would like to take advantage of this platform, to give thanks to the Most High.  
Your help made ""Lil' Phyllis Loves to Laff"" really able to reach more readers. In addition, there were many teachers, librarians, moms and dads, and especially the bright enthusiastic students who have bought a copy to read, enjoyed, and share with it others. I Love you all.

This Is What's NextNow let's do it again. The next project is a chapter book with about 100 pages . 
""Lil' Phyllis Meets Her Book Fair Fairy""Click to preview it here.​
Because ""Lil' Phyllis Meets Her Book Fair Fairy"" is a chapter book this time around, there are three times as many pages and a lot more words. I am excited to share this original tale with a fun plot line. It has been in the works for about two years. The story is written needs , but needs a little editing work. Calling all editors!
What We Need & What You Get

Whatever money we raise, I will also add to it from my personal moneys.
The goal is to raise $1,355.00 in 30 days!! However, the more money raised beyond the stated goal the more books that I am able to purchase. The reader gets a greater the value . That is because each copy of the book will cost less. 
Please see the Printer's quote in the price chart below:Prices 9,25% Sales Tax NOT Included In Prices Below
$1,355.00 / 100 Qty. Books
$1,731.00 / 150 Qty. Books
$2,313.00 / 250 Qty. Books
$3,525.00 / 500 Qty. Books
$6,145.00 / 1,000 Qty. Books
The way printing works is the more prints one orders, the lower the final price. This is good for two reasons. First, the more books printed the better. Second, the less money it costs even better because You get more value.
In the  printer's quote above, it is easy to see how the price get better the more book I have printed. $1,355.00 is what we going for. But, remember, the more You all fund the better value for everyone.For example, if together, we were to raise $6,145, each book would cost only about $6.That is a great improvement on $13. per book printed. And better for the readers too.The goal is to get the best quality printed book possible, yet get the best price possible for the customer. My Los Angeles based print shop provides both. Also, they give really good customer service to their clients. I want to be as transparent I can. So, I am showed You all how my printers actual quoted me for my print order for ""Lil' Phyllis Meets Her Book Fair Fairy"".
Wow, what a difference your contribution can make!With Contributors that are passionate about this project and believe that it's more than possible, it will be easy to publish and share my new story.
We have done it before, so lets do it again. But better.
Thank You All.

Minds Awake by Rumspringa is the official soundtrack.</p>
<p>We are very looking forward to work with them on creating much more value for Human Rights activism.</p>
<p>Thanks guys!</p>
<h3><strong><strong>PROJECT PURPOSE AND DESCRIPTION</strong></strong></h3>
<p><strong>“Human rights”</strong> have become, arguably, the two most evocative and powerful words in global political discourse. The power of human rights to transform societies has already been witnessed within many formerly authoritarian regimes, from the military juntas of South America, through to apartheid South Africa and the breakup of the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p><em>Those who would seek to continue to exercise power to the detriment of those over whom they rule have good reason to fear these two words.</em></p>
<p>However, we believe that what can be discerned and identified simply by reading all of the treaties, covenants, conventions and instruments which comprise an ever-expanding body of law, is just not enough to understand what human rights are and what they require in order to be adequately protected and promoted.</p>
<p>On the other end, the aim to enlighten those who have yet to benefit from a sufficiently enlightened education in order to overcome an ignorance of the moral authority of human rights, run a very real risk of being rejected as the more recent manifestation of arrogance and hypocrisy if it is not characterized by intellectual honesty and a willingness to accept some unpalatable truths about the world in which we live, shining a light into places which many of us have preferred to avoid.</p>
<p>Human rights evoke a shared human condition and their essence is to provide a common language for humankind, breaking down the walls which divide us in order to reduce, and hopefully eliminate, systematic human suffering.</p>
<h3>This is where our project ambitiously settle its purpose</h3>
<em>A naked visual language combined with memorable quotes from worldwide recognized champions of human rights, poetry and critical writings, historical media and actual reports, to start an “inner” and hearth-to-hearth dialogue about values such as respect for others, dignity and tolerance, drawing out skills such as critical thinking, cooperation and the ability to stand up for our rights and those of others.</em>
<p>We follow our purpose whit a great relief that a profound change in the heart of one individual can be the start of a process of change in the destiny of whole societies, and eventually the entire world–a transformation from hopelessness to hopefulness, despair to courage, dependence to interdependence, solitude to harmony, from war to peace.</p>

“Human rights” have become, arguably, the two most evocative and powerful words in global political discourse. The power of human rights to transform societies has already been witnessed within many formerly authoritarian regimes, from the military juntas of South America, through to apartheid South Africa and the breakup of the former Soviet Union.

Human rights evoke a shared human condition and their essence is to provide a common language for humankind, breaking down the walls which divide us in order to reduce, and hopefully eliminate, systematic human suffering.
This is where our project ambitiously settle its purpose

<p><strong>The participation of many people</strong> in this funding campaign has helped me with production costs -  the printing of a museum quality, colour edition of the new book, <em><strong>Piercing Time - Paris after Marville and Atget</strong></em>. The fundraising continues now through the <a href=""http://store.sramek.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Piercing Time Store"">store</a> where you can pre-order the book or buy a print. The blog continues to present images and commentary on the project:  <a href=""http://parisaftermarville.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Paris After Marville - The Blog"">http://parisaftermarville.tumblr.com</a>.</p>
<p>Although we met the goal, this is less than half of the funds needed. But... we are on the way there.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Sramek</strong> (<a href=""http://www.sramek.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sramek.ca</a>) has been a photographic artist since the 1970s and has produced many series of black and white photographs related to historic sites in France, Italy, Czech Republic, Germany and in Canada where he lives. He is <strong>Chair of Photography</strong> at <a href=""http://www.ocadu.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OCAD University</a> and is represented by the Stephen Bulger Gallery (<a href=""http://www.bulgergallery.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bulgergallery.com</a>).</p>
<p><strong>The campaign is specifically to raise the funds which Sramek has committed himself to find in order to keep the final cover price down while producing a large, expensively printed monograph.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What can you do? Begin by spreading the word to your contacts and then donate what you can, to support the project and receive the great 'perks'.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Book Maquette Image"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.sramek.ca/marville/Final-Cover-May2013.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 10px; vertical-align: text-bottom;"" title=""Book Maquette""/></strong></p>
<p>The book is to be published by <strong>Intellect Press</strong> (<a href=""http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.intellectbooks.co.uk</a>) and released through the <strong>University of Chicago Press</strong> in the fall of 2013. Production costs will be about $30,000. and financial support is needed for the high quality printing of so many image pages. The historical images will come from new, high resolution digital copywork from the <a href=""http://www.parisenimages.fr/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em><strong>Parisienne de Photographie</strong></em></a> agency in Paris who have been extremely supportive of this project.</p>
<p> In his own words:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I am really excited about the many themes which run though this project and I want the book to reflect this in its quality of production. This is probably the most significant body of work I have done to date. It will add to a wide range of fields, opening up the Marville archive in new ways for visitors to Paris as well as scholars of urban studies and photographic history. By bringing in local voices, it will give a window onto how people feel today about urban change and connect this with historical attitudes about development in this key city which brought Europe into the modern age.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Although I need $15,000 in total, this campaign aims modestly to raise a portion of this. <strong>If we can actually get to our ultimate goal, then I can move forward with our vision of high quality printing without cutting corners while still keeping the final price affordable.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">After 4 years in the making (and nearly 150 years after Marville's photographs) your participation at whatever level you choose is necessary to get this project out into the world as a physical, printed reality. <strong>Wouldn't you rather hold this in your hands than simply look at examples on youfr screen? Help us to make this book a reality.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>The Rewards</strong></p>
<p>Although you are being asked to support this project because you are excited about it, the rewards are definitely a bargain. The prints are being offered below value for this limited period, but still as signed and numbered editions. Buying the book ahead of time will give you a signed copy as soon as it is available while giving you images for your desktop right away. Prints will be produced as soon as the campaign ends.

<p><strong>The Team</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is not a commercial project.</strong> I have devoted 4 years of time and energy, research, photography and writing, not to mention funds.  <strong>Françoise Reynaud</strong> and <strong>Jean-Baptiste-Woloch</strong> at the <strong>Musée Carnavalet</strong> have generously shared their time and expertise. <strong>Min K Lee</strong> of Swarthmore College and <strong>Shalini Le Gall</strong> of NYU Paris have carried out their research and written texts. The travel and photography has been partially supported by OCAD University faculty funding and by a Google Research Award. Four assistants have helped with various aspects – <strong>Pat Navarro</strong>  and <strong>Miko Sramek</strong> have assisted with database entry and digital processing. <strong>Melissa Clark</strong> and <strong>Shanon Fujioka </strong>are working to design and moderate the social media including this campaign.</p>
<p>In the end, production of a large photo book is very expensive and one just hopes to cover costs. <strong>This is a labour of love, of cultural work, which hopes to gain your support.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Project Details</strong></p>
<p>The book documents 184 street locations of Paris and will be illustrated with almost 500 images – by Charles Marville (1860s-70s), Eugène Atget (early 1900s) and Peter Sramek (present day). Related historical maps will locate the images accurately. Texts have been written by historians Min K Lee and Shalini Le Gall, as well as Peter Sramek and interviews with Parisians will bring in a contemporary popular view of urban change. Historical images are coming from the <strong><a href=""http://carnavalet.paris.fr/en/collections/photography"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Musée Carnavalet</a></strong> with whom Sramek has worked closely and also from the <a href=""http://equipement.paris.fr/Biblioth%C3%A8que_Historique_de_la_Ville_de_Paris_(BHVP)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bibliothèque Historique</a>, Bibliothèque Nationale and MOMA (NYC).</p>
<p>Release of the book will coincide with a large exhibition of Marville photographs curated by <strong>Sarah Kennel</strong> of the<strong> National Gallery in Washington</strong>. This show will then travel to the Metropolitan Museum in NY, to the Carnavalet in Paris and the National Gallery in Ottawa.</p>

<p><b>What is <i>Happy Accidents</i> all about?</b></p>
<p>In 1997, the four original members of Four Day Weekend decided to break out on our own and take the leap to start our very own improv comedy show, in the heart of Sundance Square, in downtown Fort Worth.  The original goal? - to last 6 weeks doing a mini-run and then pack up our bags on the way to the next adventure.  Then, something funny happened on the way through this limited six-week run; the show became a hit, and it became a hit because of the amazing support of the city of Fort Worth that hosted the show, the ""powers that be"" at Sundance Square, and an amazing fan base that made it all possible!</p>
<p>One little idea of applying the transformative power of “Yes, And,” combined with the unifying thought that ""<i>if we band together we can create anything with positive intention</i>,"" and the heartfelt belief that ""<i>what we come up with together is far better than what we come up with individually</i>"" has led to our continued success.  The results have exceeded our wildest expectations!  The power of “Yes, And” helped us manifest a keynote address to the United States Congress, performing for two U.S. Presidents, being awarded the Key to the City of Fort Worth, being named Small Business of the Year in 2014 and becoming Entrepreneurs-In-Residence at TCU’s Neeley School of Business.  And all of this became possible because of two little words:  “Yes, And.""</p>
<p>In our new book, <i><strong>Happy Accidents: The Transformative Power of ""Yes, And"" at Work and in Life</strong></i>, we chronicle this amazing success story and we share how we've used “Yes, And” to transform both our working and personal lives.  For the first time ever, we are giving our amazing fans the behind-the-scenes secrets to our success and, most importantly, we want to share with you all the ways that you can unlock life's opportunities, while enjoying some laughs along the way.  And maybe, just maybe, with your help we can make it a best-seller in the process, because without you none of this would have been possible.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>

</div></div>","What is Happy Accidents all about?
In 1997, the four original members of Four Day Weekend decided to break out on our own and take the leap to start our very own improv comedy show, in the heart of Sundance Square, in downtown Fort Worth.  The original goal? - to last 6 weeks doing a mini-run and then pack up our bags on the way to the next adventure.  Then, something funny happened on the way through this limited six-week run; the show became a hit, and it became a hit because of the amazing support of the city of Fort Worth that hosted the show, the ""powers that be"" at Sundance Square, and an amazing fan base that made it all possible!
One little idea of applying the transformative power of “Yes, And,” combined with the unifying thought that ""if we band together we can create anything with positive intention,"" and the heartfelt belief that ""what we come up with together is far better than what we come up with individually"" has led to our continued success.  The results have exceeded our wildest expectations!  The power of “Yes, And” helped us manifest a keynote address to the United States Congress, performing for two U.S. Presidents, being awarded the Key to the City of Fort Worth, being named Small Business of the Year in 2014 and becoming Entrepreneurs-In-Residence at TCU’s Neeley School of Business.  And all of this became possible because of two little words:  “Yes, And.""
In our new book, Happy Accidents: The Transformative Power of ""Yes, And"" at Work and in Life, we chronicle this amazing success story and we share how we've used “Yes, And” to transform both our working and personal lives.  For the first time ever, we are giving our amazing fans the behind-the-scenes secrets to our success and, most importantly, we want to share with you all the ways that you can unlock life's opportunities, while enjoying some laughs along the way.  And maybe, just maybe, with your help we can make it a best-seller in the process, because without you none of this would have been possible.
What We Need & What You Get

We want share this book with not only our amazing fans of the show, but with people all over the world who want to be better communicators, better individuals, gain momentum in their careers, and foster a positive culture in their communities.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My education includes graduate studies in social work, non-profit management and applied statistics, B.A. degrees in Anthropology and Psychology with a Mathematics minor and certificates in Applied Computer Science and Research. While attending university, I completed an Honors Thesis on personality and social identity factors related to music preferences, a field study on the Autism community in Fort Wayne, IN and worked as a research assistant for the Psychology Department at Indiana University Purdue University-Fort Wayne (IPFW).</p>
<p>I have worked as a mental health professional, business owner and manager, created and managed a community group for individuals with substance use issues and worked as a contract IT professional and freelance writer.</p>

<p>This book seeks to shed light on a group the media has neglected to cover for the most part.

<p>Margareta Borjesson, Swedish, retired organizational consultant in my own company, 70. Mother, grandmother, ex-wife, elder sister, friend.</p>
<p> I used to be normal. Live life as expected, love my man, my home and my cat, children and grandchildren. I lost the life I used to have, due to secret netgambling for a couple of years. When my partner asked me to marry him, I was forced to tell him everything. We separated.</p>
<p> That first cold winter I survived thanks to my friend and her two dogs. I moved into a rented little house in the countryside near Norrtälje, with nothing but the most essential, my laptop and an internet connection. No Visa-card (cut it halves to prevent myself from gambling), no car, no TV – just me and my addiction. And my depression. And my tries to get society to help me quit gambling. I did not succeed in the latter.</p>

</div></div>","Margareta Borjesson, Swedish, retired organizational consultant in my own company, 70. Mother, grandmother, ex-wife, elder sister, friend.
 I used to be normal. Live life as expected, love my man, my home and my cat, children and grandchildren. I lost the life I used to have, due to secret netgambling for a couple of years. When my partner asked me to marry him, I was forced to tell him everything. We separated.
 That first cold winter I survived thanks to my friend and her two dogs. I moved into a rented little house in the countryside near Norrtälje, with nothing but the most essential, my laptop and an internet connection. No Visa-card (cut it halves to prevent myself from gambling), no car, no TV – just me and my addiction. And my depression. And my tries to get society to help me quit gambling. I did not succeed in the latter.
 I started writing in stead. On my blog, beskrivarblogg.wordpress.com. and on the writer´s site 1av3.se, where I also write a chronicle every Thursday.

<h3>Just the Facts</h3>
<p>For more than twenty years, KJ McLean has felt a strong need for a centre for creative writers in Saint John, New Brunswick -- a small city on the Atlantic coast of Canada.  Her vision is of a place where creative writing is celebrated and encouraged, where writers of all ages and experience levels can gather to learn, network share resources, and -- of course -- to write!</p>
<p>After being a substitute teacher for more than ten years, and teaching creative writing classes to adults, KJ is passionate about helping people -- particularly young people -- find their voices and tell their stories.</p>
<p>Saint John is a city that has been struggling economically in recent years.  Among other plans, KJ wants Word Collective Ink Ltd. to provide opportunities and encouragement for children and teens in priority neighbourhoods to express themselves.  Related to this, the planned location for Word Collective Ink Ltd. was chosen not only to be central and easily accessible to all, but to also help revitalize a dated business area.</p>
<p>Word Collective Ink Ltd. is a much-needed resource centre to foster cultural, societal and economic growth in Saint John -- and KJ has the passion, knowledge and dedication to make it happen.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are confident that we can cover our monthly operational costs via class fees and office rentals.  What is holding us back from opening our doors is our start-up costs.</p>
<p>We specifically need funding for:</p>
<ul>
<li>incorporation and registration</li>
<li>furniture for the offices (desks, chairs, bulletin boards)</li>
<li>furniture for the gathering/cafe area (tables and chairs)</li>
<li>electronic equipment (projector, laser printer, computer)</li>
<li>phone and Internet activation</li>
<li>upgrading the security system</li>
<li>paint and other ""sprucing up"" materials</li>
<li>extra month's rent (deposit)</li>
<li>insurance</li>
<li>other start-up costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Any funding above and beyond our start-up requirements will go into the bank account as a ""buffer.""  If we don't reach our goal, we will put the money in the Word Collective bank account until we have accumulated enough to launch.</p>
<h3>How We'll Thank You</h3>
We have four levels of funding perks to show you our appreciation!  All sponsors will receive a personal thank you email from KJ and a printable certificate of appreciation suitable for framing.  Other goodies include Word Collective USB flash drives, tote bags and t-shirts, and contributors of $1000 will have the name of their choice engraved on a Wall of Fame plaque that will be on permanent display at Word Collective Ink Ltd.</div>
<div>
<h3>You CAN Make a Difference!</h3>
By funding Word Collective's campaign, you will be directly encouraging new literary talent and changing people's lives.  Besides helping adults who have always wanted to write stories, Word Collective Ink Ltd. will also be a beacon to young people who are looking for ways to express themselves -- to deal with and share their emotions and experiences in a positive way.  Word Collective is not simply about putting words on a page -- it's about bringing people together, and breathing new life into a once-vibrant business area.  Great things happen when people come together and inspire one another -- and you can help set this chain reaction in motion!</div>

<p align=""center""><strong>Conversations with Mexican sound artists and electronic musicians</strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>A book project by Carlos  Prieto Acevedo</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>VOLTAGE VARIATIONS</strong> is an encyclopedic project based on critical interpretations of sound art, electronic and electro-acoustic music in Mexico. Published in three volumes, this is a series of 25 interviews, an extensive glossary of terms dealing with the aesthetics of sound, audio technologies, and musical genres; as well as institutional monographs and biographies. The books will also contain very rich visual documentation in the form of facsimiles and other images, as well as three downloadable compilations of music. This project, made up of detailed research and interviews done over the last five years, brings together the testimonies of composers, DJs, sound engineers, electronic music producers and sound artists, with the aim of creating an intersection of ideas about the transformations in the cultural and artistic identity in Mexico, within the amorphous territory of sound and technology.  In this collection the reader will find a series of conversations with a very diverse group of artists, from the creators of the Nortec movement, to the pioneers of radio, to electro-acoustic composers who have driven experimentation within academic circles, to the first auto-didactics who have interlaced and mixed musical genres, to DJs who have shaped the vast experience of electronic dance music, and the most recent attempts that sound art has made to translate our ways of experiencing the world.</p>

<h3> <strong>^/  WHERE WE ARE AT AND WHY WE NEED FUNDING </strong>
</h3>
<p>This project has been funded so far by a grant from the FONCA (National Cultural Fund) with in-kind services and institutional support.  We are ready to go to print!  And we need your help to make it through the last stretch.</p>
<p>Opting for collaborations with independent artists (photographer, designer, publisher) in order to keep the most freedom in terms of content, the formal aspects of the collection also reflect the ideas and methods of those artists and musicians that the book is about.  We have organized the project (the conversations with the 25 artists, the archival material and the extensive glossary) into 3 volumes, which will be released one after the other… but we need to reach our funding goal to avoid any delays!</p>
<p>As we write this, the editorial team at Deleátur is copy-editing, and the graphic design team is conforming the text, preparing each volume to go to the printers.  Now, we just need to complete our finances to be able to print in the highest quality and most environmentally sound materials, while staying true to our aesthetic and the quality we strive for.</p>
<p>All of the 25 artists have been incredible collaborators and one of the main goals of the book is to bring them more to the public eye, in Mexico and abroad.  We already have plans to translate the book into English, but all of this depends on the way we can accomplish this first release.</p>
<p>With your help, we can go to print on the three volumes, prepare our promotional campaign, and organize the special events and concerts that are already being planned and scheduled.  In fact, we have a release date of mid-May, with a whole series of events already planned from then until December 2013, in collaboration with important music festivals, art centers, and book fairs.  From Mexico City, to Monterrey, to Tijuana, to New York… it is all in our calendar… All we need now is to get the book and all the promotional materials (posters, flyers, etc) made and ready for release.  </p>
<p>Please help with any size contributions, and PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD!!</p>

<h3><strong><strong>^/  </strong>WHO ARE WE ?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>AUTHOR : Carlos Prieto Acevedo (b. 1973, Mexico City)   </strong>Carlos studied in the Philosophy Department at the Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and has specialized his work and research in Aesthetic Theory. He has worked in music and art criticism and journalism, writing for magazines, fanzines, and other publications since 1995. He was artistic programmer and producer for festivals and events revolving around electronic music, most notably MUTEK-Mexico, where he worked from 2003 to 2008. Since 2009, Carlos writes the program notes and texts for the experimental music festivals, RADAR and AURAL in Mexico City. In 2008 he was artistic director of a public art project called Peatonal, Encounters with Art and Politics, under the auspices of the Mexico City government. Carlos also produces radio programs, mostly with RADIO UNAM, where his last program was “1978: The year we lived in fear”. In 2012, Carlos was invited to produce a series of sound pieces to install in the 20th Century halls of the MUNAL (Museum of National Art) as part of a curated program called “Contemporary Dialogues”. This series of sound art pieces that he made were called “Sonoral Intermitencies of Modernity” and were installed along side pieces by José Clemente Orozco, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera among other painters. For the last few years, Carlos has been researching and writing the book project, VOLTAGE VARIATIONS, which are compiled of dialogues with 25 Mexican electronic musicians, old and young. The book, made up of three volumes, will be released in May and October 2013, accompained by a series of concerts. The book was developed with the support of the FONCA. Since 2009, Carlos is a full time professor at the Universidad del Claustro de Sor Juana, where he teaches a seminar on the philosophy of communication. /</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>Conversaciones con artistas sonoros y músicos electrónicos mexicanos</strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong> Un proyecto de Carlos Prieto Acevedo</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>VARIACIÓN DE VOLTAJE</strong> es un proyecto enciclopédico de divulgación e interpretación crítica del arte sonoro y la música electrónica y electroacústica mexicana.  Editado en 3 tomos, está conformado por 25 entrevistas, un extenso glosario de términos sobre estética del sonido, tecnología de audio, géneros musicales, monografías institucionales y biografías. Incluye también una rica documentación facsimilar y gráfica, así como tres discos descargables de audio. El proyecto, realizado mediante una investigación documental y entrevistas con diversos creadores mexicanos a lo largo de 5 años, incorpora los testimonios de compositores, DJ's, ingenieros de audio, productores de música electrónica y artistas sonoros, con la intención de integrar en un documento el paisaje de alteraciones a la identidad artística y cultural mexicana desde el territorio amorfo de la tecnología y el sonido.  En este compendio se ponen a disposición del lector una serie de conversaciones con artistas tan diversos como los creadores del movimiento Nortec, los pioneros de la radio, los compositores electroacústicos que impulsaron la experimentación desde los espacios académicos, los primeros autodidactas en cruzar y entrelazar categorías y géneros musicales, los DJ's que forjaron la experiencia masiva de la electrónica de baile, hasta las tentativas más recientes del arte sonoro por desbordar nuestras formas de experimentar el mundo.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>^/  <strong><strong>¿</strong></strong> DÓNDE NOS ENCONTRAMOS Y PORQUÉ NECESITAMOS TU AYUDA?</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Este proyecto fue auspiciado en un inicio, cuando era muchísimo más pequeño y sencillo, por el programa de co-inversiones del FONCA, y se ha continuado (y ampliado gigantescamente) gracias al respaldo de otras instituciones, iniciativas independientes, y fundamentalmente a la generosidad de muchos individuos. ¡Estamos listos para entrar a la imprenta! Justo por eso necesitamos tu apoyo para finalizar la etapa de producción, ese último paso indispensable para que el proyecto llegue a las manos de todos los que han hecho de la electricidad y el sonido parte de su vida, o a los que se interesan acercarse a este fenómeno del arte sonoro y la música electrónica.</p>
<p>La colaboración y el trabajo de artistas independientes en el proyecto (los editores, el fotógrafo, la artista gráfica), nos permitió mantener una gran libertad en términos de contenido y en la forma en que se organiza la información y la rica documentación. Ya que los aspectos formales de la colección y de cada uno de los libros reproduce de alguna manera los métodos e ideas de los propios artistas sonoros y músicos de los que trata el proyecto. Consta de 25 amplias conversaciones, un abundante material facsimilar y gráfico, y un extenso glosario, ha sido organizado en 3 volúmenes que saldrán consecutivamente uno después del otro durante el año... ¡pero aún necesitamos alcanzar nuestro monto a recaudar para evitar cualquier retraso!</p>
<p>Mientras tú lees esto, el equipo editorial del estudio Deleátur está preparando cada volumen para entrara a impresión: revisando minuciosamente cada una de las páginas y formando en un extraordinario diseño editorial el inmenso contendido; y la diseñadora está retocando los materiales gráficos. Sólo necesitamos completar nuestros presupuestos de producción y garantizar con ello la más alta calidad en los materiales y procesos de impresión y en las plataformas digitales en línea de donde podrás descargar las antologías de música que acompañan éste titánico compendio.</p>
<p>Los 25 creadores han sido increíblemente generosos con el proyecto, y uno de los principales objetivos es darle una mayor visibilidad a su trabajo en México y en el contexto internacional. Incluso ya se tiene planeada su traducción al inglés, pero todo depende de la manera en que logremos imprimir el primero.</p>
<p>Con tu apoyo y aportaciones podremos entrar a la imprenta con los 3 volúmenes, preparar nuestra campaña promocional y la gira de presentaciones, conciertos y eventos especiales que incluso ya están en la agenda y que realizaremos en colaboración con importantes festivales, ferias y centros artísticos. Nuestra fecha oficial de presentación ya está programada para la segunda semana de mayo, con un evento fuera de serie en el festival Aural; y continuamos hasta diciembre con más actividades y descargas sonoras, electrizando el año entero. Desde el Distrito Federal hasta Monterrey, Tijuana, Guadalajara y Nueva York ¡ya está todo calendarizado! lo único que nos falta es imprimir el libro y los materiales de promoción (carteles, programas de mano, fyers etcétera), ¡y tenerlos listos para su lanzamiento!</p>
<p>Ayúdanos con cualquier tipo de contribución, no importa el tamaño... Y POR FAVOR ¡DIFUNDELO! </p>

<p><strong>AUTOR : Carlos Prieto Acevedo (cd. de México, 1973)  </strong>Cursó estudios de licenciatura en filosofía en la FFYL de la UNAM, concentrando sus intereses en la teoría estética. Incursiona en el periodismo y la crítica musical en suplementos, revistas, fanzines y fundando publicaciones desde 1995 hasta la fecha. Fue programador artístico, director de información y productor de eventos, festivales y encuentros relacionados con la música electrónica en México desde fines de los años 90, entre ellos MUTEK - México durante el período 2003-2008. Ha dedicado parte de su trabajo filosófico a investigar la relación entre el sonido y lo social, y en las posibilidades del medio radiofónico creando proyectos digitales y analógicos, series documentales, e incluso tentativas de señal analógica para radios comunitarias. Desde 2009 colabora en la redacción de los programas de mano de electrónica experimental del festival Radar y luego en Aural. En 2008 fue director artístico del proyecto de arte público Peatonal, Encuentros de Arte y Política, auspiciado por el GDF.

VOLTAGE VARIATIONS
Conversations with Mexican sound artists and electronic musicians
A book project by Carlos  Prieto Acevedo
 
VOLTAGE VARIATIONS is an encyclopedic project based on critical interpretations of sound art, electronic and electro-acoustic music in Mexico. Published in three volumes, this is a series of 25 interviews, an extensive glossary of terms dealing with the aesthetics of sound, audio technologies, and musical genres; as well as institutional monographs and biographies. The books will also contain very rich visual documentation in the form of facsimiles and other images, as well as three downloadable compilations of music. This project, made up of detailed research and interviews done over the last five years, brings together the testimonies of composers, DJs, sound engineers, electronic music producers and sound artists, with the aim of creating an intersection of ideas about the transformations in the cultural and artistic identity in Mexico, within the amorphous territory of sound and technology.  In this collection the reader will find a series of conversations with a very diverse group of artists, from the creators of the Nortec movement, to the pioneers of radio, to electro-acoustic composers who have driven experimentation within academic circles, to the first auto-didactics who have interlaced and mixed musical genres, to DJs who have shaped the vast experience of electronic dance music, and the most recent attempts that sound art has made to translate our ways of experiencing the world.

 
ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS IN THE COLLECTION :
VOLUME 1. Antonio Russek · Roberto Morales Manzanares · (Bostich) Ramón Amescua · Mario de Vega · Walter Schmidt · (Murcof) Fernando Corona Murillo · Rodolfo Sánchez Alvarado· Manuel Rocha Iturbide · Héctor Quintanar.
VOLUME 2. Rodrigo Sigal · Plug (Cristian Cárdenas) · Álvaro Ruiz · Rogelio Sosa · DJ Chrysler (Luis Carlos Gómez) · Fax (Rubén Alonso Tamayo) · Gonzalo Macías ·Gabriela Ortíz.
VOLUME 3. Duopandamix · Ángel Sánchez Borges · Angélica Castelló · Guillermo Galindo · Israel Martínez · Javier Álvarez · Manrico Montero · Pepe Mogt
 
 ^/  WHERE WE ARE AT AND WHY WE NEED FUNDING 

This project has been funded so far by a grant from the FONCA (National Cultural Fund) with in-kind services and institutional support.  We are ready to go to print!  And we need your help to make it through the last stretch.
Opting for collaborations with independent artists (photographer, designer, publisher) in order to keep the most freedom in terms of content, the formal aspects of the collection also reflect the ideas and methods of those artists and musicians that the book is about.  We have organized the project (the conversations with the 25 artists, the archival material and the extensive glossary) into 3 volumes, which will be released one after the other… but we need to reach our funding goal to avoid any delays!
As we write this, the editorial team at Deleátur is copy-editing, and the graphic design team is conforming the text, preparing each volume to go to the printers.  Now, we just need to complete our finances to be able to print in the highest quality and most environmentally sound materials, while staying true to our aesthetic and the quality we strive for.
All of the 25 artists have been incredible collaborators and one of the main goals of the book is to bring them more to the public eye, in Mexico and abroad.  We already have plans to translate the book into English, but all of this depends on the way we can accomplish this first release.
With your help, we can go to print on the three volumes, prepare our promotional campaign, and organize the special events and concerts that are already being planned and scheduled.  In fact, we have a release date of mid-May, with a whole series of events already planned from then until December 2013, in collaboration with important music festivals, art centers, and book fairs.  From Mexico City, to Monterrey, to Tijuana, to New York… it is all in our calendar… All we need now is to get the book and all the promotional materials (posters, flyers, etc) made and ready for release.  
Please help with any size contributions, and PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD!!

Carlos also produces radio programs, mostly with RADIO UNAM, where his last program was “1978: The year we lived in fear”. In 2012, Carlos was invited to produce a series of sound pieces to install in the 20th Century halls of the MUNAL (Museum of National Art) as part of a curated program called “Contemporary Dialogues”. This series of sound art pieces that he made were called “Sonoral Intermitencies of Modernity” and were installed along side pieces by José Clemente Orozco, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera among other painters. For the last few years, Carlos has been researching and writing the book project, VOLTAGE VARIATIONS, which are compiled of dialogues with 25 Mexican electronic musicians, old and young. The book, made up of three volumes, will be released in May and October 2013, accompained by a series of concerts. The book was developed with the support of the FONCA. Since 2009, Carlos is a full time professor at the Universidad del Claustro de Sor Juana, where he teaches a seminar on the philosophy of communication. /

VARIACIÓN DE VOLTAJE
Conversaciones con artistas sonoros y músicos electrónicos mexicanos
 Un proyecto de Carlos Prieto Acevedo
 
VARIACIÓN DE VOLTAJE es un proyecto enciclopédico de divulgación e interpretación crítica del arte sonoro y la música electrónica y electroacústica mexicana.  Editado en 3 tomos, está conformado por 25 entrevistas, un extenso glosario de términos sobre estética del sonido, tecnología de audio, géneros musicales, monografías institucionales y biografías. Incluye también una rica documentación facsimilar y gráfica, así como tres discos descargables de audio. El proyecto, realizado mediante una investigación documental y entrevistas con diversos creadores mexicanos a lo largo de 5 años, incorpora los testimonios de compositores, DJ's, ingenieros de audio, productores de música electrónica y artistas sonoros, con la intención de integrar en un documento el paisaje de alteraciones a la identidad artística y cultural mexicana desde el territorio amorfo de la tecnología y el sonido.  En este compendio se ponen a disposición del lector una serie de conversaciones con artistas tan diversos como los creadores del movimiento Nortec, los pioneros de la radio, los compositores electroacústicos que impulsaron la experimentación desde los espacios académicos, los primeros autodidactas en cruzar y entrelazar categorías y géneros musicales, los DJ's que forjaron la experiencia masiva de la electrónica de baile, hasta las tentativas más recientes del arte sonoro por desbordar nuestras formas de experimentar el mundo.

^/  ¿ DÓNDE NOS ENCONTRAMOS Y PORQUÉ NECESITAMOS TU AYUDA?
Este proyecto fue auspiciado en un inicio, cuando era muchísimo más pequeño y sencillo, por el programa de co-inversiones del FONCA, y se ha continuado (y ampliado gigantescamente) gracias al respaldo de otras instituciones, iniciativas independientes, y fundamentalmente a la generosidad de muchos individuos. ¡Estamos listos para entrar a la imprenta! Justo por eso necesitamos tu apoyo para finalizar la etapa de producción, ese último paso indispensable para que el proyecto llegue a las manos de todos los que han hecho de la electricidad y el sonido parte de su vida, o a los que se interesan acercarse a este fenómeno del arte sonoro y la música electrónica.
La colaboración y el trabajo de artistas independientes en el proyecto (los editores, el fotógrafo, la artista gráfica), nos permitió mantener una gran libertad en términos de contenido y en la forma en que se organiza la información y la rica documentación. Ya que los aspectos formales de la colección y de cada uno de los libros reproduce de alguna manera los métodos e ideas de los propios artistas sonoros y músicos de los que trata el proyecto. Consta de 25 amplias conversaciones, un abundante material facsimilar y gráfico, y un extenso glosario, ha sido organizado en 3 volúmenes que saldrán consecutivamente uno después del otro durante el año... ¡pero aún necesitamos alcanzar nuestro monto a recaudar para evitar cualquier retraso!
Mientras tú lees esto, el equipo editorial del estudio Deleátur está preparando cada volumen para entrara a impresión: revisando minuciosamente cada una de las páginas y formando en un extraordinario diseño editorial el inmenso contendido; y la diseñadora está retocando los materiales gráficos. Sólo necesitamos completar nuestros presupuestos de producción y garantizar con ello la más alta calidad en los materiales y procesos de impresión y en las plataformas digitales en línea de donde podrás descargar las antologías de música que acompañan éste titánico compendio.
Los 25 creadores han sido increíblemente generosos con el proyecto, y uno de los principales objetivos es darle una mayor visibilidad a su trabajo en México y en el contexto internacional. Incluso ya se tiene planeada su traducción al inglés, pero todo depende de la manera en que logremos imprimir el primero.
Con tu apoyo y aportaciones podremos entrar a la imprenta con los 3 volúmenes, preparar nuestra campaña promocional y la gira de presentaciones, conciertos y eventos especiales que incluso ya están en la agenda y que realizaremos en colaboración con importantes festivales, ferias y centros artísticos. Nuestra fecha oficial de presentación ya está programada para la segunda semana de mayo, con un evento fuera de serie en el festival Aural; y continuamos hasta diciembre con más actividades y descargas sonoras, electrizando el año entero. Desde el Distrito Federal hasta Monterrey, Tijuana, Guadalajara y Nueva York ¡ya está todo calendarizado! lo único que nos falta es imprimir el libro y los materiales de promoción (carteles, programas de mano, fyers etcétera), ¡y tenerlos listos para su lanzamiento!
Ayúdanos con cualquier tipo de contribución, no importa el tamaño... Y POR FAVOR ¡DIFUNDELO!

<h3>South Dakota Internship 2012</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Maddie, and I am creating this campaign to help fund my summer-long mission trip to Eagle Butte, South Dakota. I am an upcoming sophomore at the University of Tennessee, and this will be my third trip to South Dakota. </p>
<p>The past two summers, I have had the incredible opportunity of going to an indian reservation in South Dakota for one week. While there, my team and I have put on Vacation Bible School for the children in several very small (10-20 homes) communities on the reservation. These communities are extremely impoverished, and they are about 50 miles away from a gallon of milk. The children in these small ""towns"" do not see much hope in their lives, and will surely see none if someone does not step in and show it to them.</p>
<p>This summer, I have been blessed with the opportunity to go to this reservation for the entire summer. I will be living in a town called Eagle Butte, where I will be working as an intern at the tiny church we have partnered with for the past two years, First Baptist Church of Eagle Butte; I will be going without a team, completely on my own. While there, I will help put on Vacation Bible School, teach Sunday school, help lead worship in the church, coordinate mission trips that other churches will be taking to Eagle Butte, and doing just about anything and everything the staff at the church needs me to.</p>
<p>I have created this campaign to raise enough money to sustain me while I live there, get me home at the end of the summer, and hopefully invest a little in the lives of the young people in Eagle Butte and the surrounding communities. Any donation helps, and if you are unable to donate, please keep the children on the reservation in your prayers; they need hope, and I pray the Lord can use me to show them some of the hope He has given me in my life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Every Dollar Counts! </h3>
<p>This trip is a very flexible one; because the costs are not set in stone, I simply need enough to get me through the summer. The church at Eagle Butte has already sacrificially paid for my trip from Tennessee to South Dakota, but I will still need funding for the rest of the trip as I will not be paid for my work there, and will not have a job otherwise.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise $1000. This, added to the money I have already, should cover living expenses, transportation, and work that is needed for my car before I drive it halfway across the country. </p>
<p>At the end of the summer if there are somehow leftover funds, they will go to First Baptist Church of Eagle Butte. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How Your Donation Helps</h3>
<p>In the past two summers, we have seen several children come to know Christ as their savior through Vacation Bible School. This is a rare occurrence on the reservation, as the adults who live there are generally very traditional, and hold to the beliefs of their ancestors. Rather than worshiping the Creator, they worship the created, and this has left the reservation hopeless.</p>
<p>My hope is to see more changed lives among the children on the reservation. Jesus said to come to him with a childlike faith, and there are few things that bring joy and hope into hardened hearts like the faith of a child. This is not only my hope, but also the hope of the team that will be joining me for a week in July. This is the same team that has allowed me to serve alongside them for the past two summers, from our church Sevier Heights Baptist in Knoxville, TN. </p>
<p>We as a group have one vision--to see change on the indian reservation in South Dakota, and to see that change begin in the hearts of the children. We see a new generation, one that is full of hope, ambition, and passion for the Lord. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Funding Is Not All I Need! </h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, there is something you can do that is of far greater worth: pray. This town is a very spiritually dark place, and can, at times, be dangerous for followers of Christ. Pray for my safety, but even more pray that the Lord will soften the hearts of the Lakota-Sioux indians and open their ears to hear what He has to say. Pray that he will give me boldness and the right words to say. </p>
<p>I am more than grateful for every prayer you pray for me; I need it more than anything else. Thank you for your interest in my trip! </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Gráinne. I have the most awesome dog in the world named <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=327762067280262&amp;set=a.327762030613599.81241.322928377763631&amp;type=3&amp;theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Gráinne&amp;Finbarr"">Finbarr</a>. He is a loveable little guy, FULL of energy! His hobbies include; rolling over and getting belly rubs, peeing on trees, running around chasing tennis balls, and doing a lot of tricks for treats. And although he might not know it yet, he's coming with me to walk the Camino de Santiago in Spain on April 23rd! I'm 29 years old and I'm from Ireland. After working in a job for more than 5 years, I stopped. I simply realised that I needed to follow what I was passionate about instead. I think we all reach a point in our lives when we want more from ourselves and when we want to give more to those around us; to really make a difference. </p>
<p>Last year I came across something that I felt truly passionate about; the story of Paco Larrañaga. Here is someone who has missed out on a lot of fun we've all had growing up. He was wrongly convcited aged 19 in 1997 and he is still in prison now. After watching a film called <a href=""http://www.giveuptomorrow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""GiveUpTomorrowFilm"">Give Up Tomorrow</a> last year about his case I just knew I had to do something to help. First I gave a major contribution to the campaign that helped launch the Free Paco Now campaign, and then I started working to get the film screened in festivals all over Ireland. I go and promote the screenings every way I can (with Finbarr of course). You can see some photos <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.372810826068069.107568.175529719129515&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""FB Film Festivals"">here</a>.</p>
<p>And now here I am, about to embark on a massive 356mile (573km) journey walking across northern Spain, with my little dog, to raise funds and awareness for his case.</p>
<h3><strong>Tell Me More<br/></strong></h3>
<p>So my dog and I are setting off for Spain to trek the Camino de Santiago for Paco. We will walk 356 miles (573km), which is the exact distance that Paco Larrañaga was from the scene of the alleged crime on the 16th July 1997. The trek should take about 30 days. Paco has served nearly 15 years in prisons in both the Philippines and Spain for a crime he had no part in.</p>
<p><strong>Quick summary of Paco’s situation: </strong>Paco Larrañaga, despite having 42 witnesses, photos, and loads of physical evidence on his side, was convicted for a crime that happened on a different island, 356 miles away on the day he was taking exams at cooking school. You can watch a short video summary of the injustice <a href=""http://freepaconow.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Are you sure he’s innocent?</strong> YES! But I’m not the only one. Paco’s case has been championed by Amnesty International, Fair Trials International, Reprieve, and the United Nations Human Rights Committee (<a href=""http://freepaconow.com/case-documents/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">read the decision here</a>). They were successful in saving him from being executed, but he remains wrongfully imprisoned. Paco was 19 when he was locked up and is now 34. This innocent man deserves a chance at a real life. One where he can freely walk around and enjoy the daily things we all take for granted, like grabbing a coffee, meeting with friends, walking through a park, looking at funny stuff on the internet. Just think of all the things you've done in the past 15 years!</p>
<h3>HOW YOU CAN BE A PART OF THE CAMINO FOR PACO:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>This 15 year ordeal has taken a toll on Paco and his family in every way imaginable; in order to sustain this battle they need our help. My goal of $14,500 is $1000 for each year Paco has been in prison. He is now fighting a  battle on 2 fronts, both the Philippines and Spain. Money will go directly to the <a href=""http://freepaconow.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FREE PACO NOW</a> campaign. This is where we can really make a difference in his life right away. Our target is modest comapared to what is actually needed, so I hope together we can exceed this goal. In return you will receive a reward of your choice; there's lots to choose from! European funders please keep in mind that $1 is 76cent so $60 is only €45.</p>
<h3><strong>25% Towards Philippine Innocence Project</strong></h3>
<p>At Paco’s request, a percentage of the money will also be allocated to help the launching of the <a href=""http://www.innocenceproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""InnocenceProjectPhilippines"">Innocence Project</a> in the Philippines to help others wrongfully convicted.</p>
<p>""If this tragedy that happened to me can be used to prevent another innocent person from suffering the same injustice and even save lives, then all those years that I have suffered would not be in vain. To believe that somehow you can be an instrument of change for the better makes your cross easier to bear."" Paco Larrañaga</p>
<h3><strong>15% Towards Irish Animal Rescue Centres<br/></strong></h3>
<p>As Finbarr himself is a rescue dog, a percentage of the money raised will also go to the Friends of Animals Rescue Centre Mullingar and the Dog Action Welfare Group Cork in Ireland. These two great voluntary groups provide a home for stray, neglected and abandoned dogs and ultimately give them a second chance at life. If those dogs had been left with the council dog pound they would have been destroyed after 5 days. In these two areas alone, a total of 830 dogs were destroyed by the council pounds in 2010. Both shelters have over 70 dogs in their care awaiting new homes. For every dog that is re-homed, more are waiting to come into the shelters. In 2011, D.A.W.G helped 998 dogs. Many of the dogs that come into their care require extensive veterinary care resulting in huge costs for both shelters. As both shelters are run mainly by volunteers they survive on funds and donations from the public to keep going. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What happened to Paco clearly shows that there are cracks in the Justice system of the Philippines that need to be addressed. Although it may takes years to fix the systemic problems of the Philippine police force and justice system, the creation of a Philippine Innocence Project would be the first important step to preventing injustice and saving the wrongfully accused. Had there been DNA testing in the Philippines when Paco and his 6 other co-accused were arrested, the course of their lives would have been completely different. Paco would like your help to save others through the Philippine Innocence Project.</p>

Es un pequeño adorable con mucha energía. Entre sus hobbies está el de girarse sobre sí mismo y coleccionar caricias en la barriga, orinar en los árboles, correr detrás de pelotas de tenis y hacer muchos trucos para obtener premios. Y aunque todavía no lo sabe ¡se viene conmigo a recorrer el Camino de Santiago en España el 23 de abril!</p>
<p>Tengo 29 años y soy irlandesa. Tras cinco años trabajando, lo he dejado. Me he dado cuenta que necesito seguir mis pasiones. Creo que todos, en algún momento, queremos dar más de nosotros mismo y ayudar a los que están a nuestro alrededor; hacer algo que realmente suponga una diferencia.</p>
<p>El año pasado algo me hizo hervir por dentro; la historia de Paco Larrañaga. Una persona que no ha disfrutado de su juventud. En 1997, con 19 años fue condenado de forma errónea y sigue en prisión. Después de ver el documental <a href=""http://www.giveuptomorrow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Give Up Tomorrow</strong></a> (Ríndete Mañana)  supe que debía hacer algo por ayudarle. Primero hice una gran donación a la campaña Free Paco Now. Y después hice todo lo posible para que la película se proyectara por toda Irlanda y participara en Festivales de todo el país. Cada día promociono la película (con Finbarr, por supuesto).

<p>Así que mi perro y yo estamos preparados para hacer el Camino de Santiago en España. Caminaremos 573 kilómetros, que es la distancia exacta que separaba a Paco del lugar donde tuvieron lugar los supuestos crímenes el 16 de julio de 1997. La caminata debería durar 30 días.

Mi objetivo es conseguir 14.500 dólares, 1.000 dólares por año de condena de Paco. Ahora lucha en dos frentes: en Filipinas y España. El dinero irá directamente a la campaña  <a href=""http://spanish.freepaconow.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>FREE PACO NOW</strong></a>.

En el año 2011, D.A.W.G. acogió a 998 perros.  Muchos de estos perros necesitan cuidados de un veterinario, lo que supone un gran coste. Ambas asociaciones se mantienen por donaciones del público y voluntarios.</p>

Summary
Hi, my name is Gráinne. I have the most awesome dog in the world named Finbarr. He is a loveable little guy, FULL of energy! His hobbies include; rolling over and getting belly rubs, peeing on trees, running around chasing tennis balls, and doing a lot of tricks for treats. And although he might not know it yet, he's coming with me to walk the Camino de Santiago in Spain on April 23rd! I'm 29 years old and I'm from Ireland. After working in a job for more than 5 years, I stopped. I simply realised that I needed to follow what I was passionate about instead. I think we all reach a point in our lives when we want more from ourselves and when we want to give more to those around us; to really make a difference. 
Last year I came across something that I felt truly passionate about; the story of Paco Larrañaga. Here is someone who has missed out on a lot of fun we've all had growing up. He was wrongly convcited aged 19 in 1997 and he is still in prison now. After watching a film called Give Up Tomorrow last year about his case I just knew I had to do something to help. First I gave a major contribution to the campaign that helped launch the Free Paco Now campaign, and then I started working to get the film screened in festivals all over Ireland. I go and promote the screenings every way I can (with Finbarr of course). You can see some photos here.
And now here I am, about to embark on a massive 356mile (573km) journey walking across northern Spain, with my little dog, to raise funds and awareness for his case.
Tell Me More
So my dog and I are setting off for Spain to trek the Camino de Santiago for Paco. We will walk 356 miles (573km), which is the exact distance that Paco Larrañaga was from the scene of the alleged crime on the 16th July 1997. The trek should take about 30 days. Paco has served nearly 15 years in prisons in both the Philippines and Spain for a crime he had no part in.
Quick summary of Paco’s situation: Paco Larrañaga, despite having 42 witnesses, photos, and loads of physical evidence on his side, was convicted for a crime that happened on a different island, 356 miles away on the day he was taking exams at cooking school. You can watch a short video summary of the injustice here.
Are you sure he’s innocent? YES! But I’m not the only one. Paco’s case has been championed by Amnesty International, Fair Trials International, Reprieve, and the United Nations Human Rights Committee (read the decision here). They were successful in saving him from being executed, but he remains wrongfully imprisoned. Paco was 19 when he was locked up and is now 34. This innocent man deserves a chance at a real life. One where he can freely walk around and enjoy the daily things we all take for granted, like grabbing a coffee, meeting with friends, walking through a park, looking at funny stuff on the internet.

<p>I’ve had many opportunities to witness the effects of bullying while working as a librarian. When I realized that modern technology had enhanced the bully's ability to cause pain—with students seemingly unaware of the true danger of the electronic toys that ruled their days—I designed an anti-bullying curriculum to incorporate into my lessons. I researched everything I could find about the subject, and what I found stunned and horrified me.</p>
<p>Being a librarian, I know that young people need a user-friendly way to understand the problem. They need to easily grasp both how a bully works and how to recognize the signs that someone is a bullying victim. <em>Gray Zone</em> was written to give them that knowledge and to open a much-needed dialog.</p>
<p>I have a master of library and information science and a bachelor of arts in anthropology, both from the University of Washington, as well as a master of fine arts in creative writing from Full Sail University.</p>
<p> I’ve written the book. I need your help getting it out there.</p>
<p> <strong>What I Need</strong></p>
<p>Promoting a book so that it gets in front of the right people can be a laborious and costly project. I need money for:<br/><br/>-Book reviews from Booklist, Clarion, Kirkus, and Publisher's Weekly. Objective reviews from these professionals are necessary to put <em>Gray Zone</em> firmly on the radar of book buyers.</p>
<p>-Sell Sheets. A one-page sheet that gives details of the book to potential buyers in libraries, bookstores, and other organizations. My background is in writing and I need a graphic designer to make a professional quality sell sheet.</p>
<p>-Postage and printing. Some organizations will accept a sell sheet electronically, but many still prefer to have it sent through the mail.</p>
<p>-Publicity Campaign. A press kit is needed as well as multiple press releases. The releases need to be written and distributed through the proper channels at the appropriate times. Again, this is an area in which I have no experience and need professional help.</p>
<p>For your help the most precious thing I can give you, other than heartfelt thanks, is a copy of my book. Every contributor above the $25 level gets a signed copy, and gets it before the publication date. So your contribution will let you be ahead of the crowd!</p>
<p><strong>Why I’m doing this</strong></p>
<p>I wrote <em>Gray Zone</em> because I saw a need. Cyberbullying is just too rampant in today’s world and it’s up to us to put a stop to it.</p>
<p><em>Gray Zone</em> is the tool we need to do this.</p>
<p>I realize that not everyone will be able to contribute monetarily. That’s okay.</p>

<h3>About This Fundraiser</h3>
<p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>As most of you will know, my name is Adrian Dziewanski. As a lot of you probably don't know, I spend a great deal of my time writing poetry. Until this point in my writing ""career"" (more like a passionate hobby), I've made little effort to get my work out into the world aside from the occasional open mic reading.</p>
<p>I'd like to change all that with your help. I've completed two chapbooks of poetry, one of which, is a collection of nearly all of the work I've done up to this point. So please help in contributing and I will personally deliver what is essentially my life's story, straight to your doorstep. That is, I will actually get on my bike and deliver it to your doorstep. </p>
<p>As much as I would love to be 100% self motivated in my pursuit of words onto the page, there comes a point when even the most humble of artists/writers need recognition in one form or another. I'm seeking this now and I promise that a donation in any amount would go a long way.</p>
<h3>What you are Funding</h3>
<p>The money will help fuel not only my artistic esteem, but will go towards a brand new book of poems! It's hard to say what the new book will consist of, but I've been writing a lot of haikus and haiku variations as of late, if that gives any clues. For some reason I already have a working title for it: ""The Ground is Lava"". I Hope to have this work completed by mid October. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get When You Help Me</h3>
<p>I'm the one raising the funds, but you are the one getting the reward. Ha!</p>
<p>My contribution ladder looks like this:</p>
<p>$5 : gets you a copy of my first chapbook ""Epoch of Humility"", a fifteen page long poem that I regard as the pinnacle of my writing to date. </p>
<p>$10 : gets you a copy of ""Hellodrama"", a full collection of poems from 2008-2013. These books are perfect bound on professional paper stock and come in one of three colours: green, white or salmon. You get to choose your colour.</p>
<p>$13 : gets you both ""Hellodrama"" and ""Epoch of Humility"".</p>
<p>$15+ : gets you both ""Hellodrama"", ""Epoch of Humility"" and a personalized haiku written on the inside cover of the former. </p>
<p>All funds will go towards a new chapbook of haikus, even if I don't reach my goal of $200. (I know it says $500, but that's only because that was the minimum amount)</p>
<p><strong>*Please view the gallery tab at top of page to see photos of the above mentioned books</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe, and have always believed, that funding creative projects is important. I've made efforts to purchase peoples' writing, music and art in the past. Now I'm just asking for a little bit in return. </p>
<p>This is the reason why I get up in the morning. I hope you can relate and equate that to something you feel passionate about in your life. It's important.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know we are all broke, so if you really can't spare 5 bucks then please help me spread the word about this little fundraiser. Or you can come to my next reading.</p>

</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>It’s said that history is written by the victorious. It’s one
of the privileges of being a winner to be able to write and re-write history.
As long as you can’t write history, then you aren’t completely a winner yet. </p>
<p>For the Egyptian authorities, I’m just a criminal who had
been in jail before for his crimes, and who is living abroad to avoid being in
jail again for the crimes committed while being abroad. That’s the history that
the Egyptian dictatorship wants to write. If they are to become winners, this
will be the known story for generations to come. But if I can prevent them from
writing my history, they will never be able to be counted victorious. </p>
<p>That’s why my story has to be told and known, and stories of
those who struggled against the Egyptian dictatorship, to prevent present and
future leaders of Egypt from writing their own version of history. Because,
even after prison and exile,<span>  the battle
won’t be over until a winner writes history, and I wanna write it!</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Why this book is important?</b></p>
<p>I believe my story is unique. I see the politic situation from a different prospective than the conservative majority in Egypt.

</div></div>","My Autobiography - Maikel Nabil Sanad



It’s said that history is written by the victorious. It’s one
of the privileges of being a winner to be able to write and re-write history.
As long as you can’t write history, then you aren’t completely a winner yet. 
For the Egyptian authorities, I’m just a criminal who had
been in jail before for his crimes, and who is living abroad to avoid being in
jail again for the crimes committed while being abroad. That’s the history that
the Egyptian dictatorship wants to write. If they are to become winners, this
will be the known story for generations to come. But if I can prevent them from
writing my history, they will never be able to be counted victorious. 
That’s why my story has to be told and known, and stories of
those who struggled against the Egyptian dictatorship, to prevent present and
future leaders of Egypt from writing their own version of history. Because,
even after prison and exile,  the battle
won’t be over until a winner writes history, and I wanna write it!

Why this book is important?
I believe my story is unique. I see the politic situation from a different prospective than the conservative majority in Egypt. Even, I was born to a Christian family, I maybe was the first Egyptian in our time to say in public that he is an atheist. I was also the first Egyptian to refuse the military service in conscientious grounds. I was, and maybe still, the only Egyptian opposition figure promoting peace ties with Israel. 
For what I said and done, I was detained five times in Egypt. Last time, I was put on military trial twice, then sentenced to three years. Thanks to a huge international campaign, and to my 130 days hunger strike, I was released after 10 months. I faced torture, and was put in a mental hospital as a punishment for my writings. After I left Egypt, Egyptian authorities accused me with blasphemy because of my atheism.
Such sacrifices didn't go unnoticed. I was awarded several prizes, and was nominated to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012.

<b>RASSEGNA INTERNAZIONALE DEL FUMETTO E CINEMA DI ANIMAZIONE DELLA CALABRIA.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Fumetti, film d'animazione, giochi, cosplay, musica, workshop, ospiti nazionali e internazionali sono la cornice perfetta per dar vita al punto d’incontro
per giovani, disegnatori, appassionati e curiosi di tutta la regione e del sud Italia in generale. </p>
<p>Entrando al Lamezia
Comics ci si trova catapultati all’interno di uno spazio vitale ed interattivo
che abbraccia sia l'arte, la creatività, ma anche il fumetto e il gioco,  con cura e professionalità le <b>aree</b>
della:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Cultura</b>
     tramite la diffusione di fumetti, mostre, film, concerti, presentazione di
     libri illustrati, incontro e confronto con personalità di rilievo; stimoli per la crescita di ogni persona, giovane o adulta che sia. </li>
<li>
<b>Socialità</b>
     attraverso momenti di gioco, di intrattenimento, work-shop; il tutto è basato sul 
     “gusto dello stare
     con gli altri, come una famiglia”, per conoscere persone con
     gli stessi interessi e passioni. Condividendo un momento che sia di
     spensieratezza ma anche di creatività. </li>
<li>
<b>Produttività</b> dando spazio a giovani artisti, i
     quali tramite noi trovano lo spazio, la fiducia, il desiderio di
     continuare nel loro lavoro o passione che sia e di migliorare le proprie
     qualità artistiche, riuscendo, in fiera, anche ad affacciarsi al mondo del
     lavoro (commissione di lavori o vendita di proprie opere); in
     quest’ambito, il nostro intento è di continuare, sempre più, ad accogliere
     e riuscire a dare spazio alle sterminate realtà regionali che vivono di
     questo mondo fantastico, non riuscendo, spesso, ad avere la giusta
     visibilità.</li>

<p>Da non
sottovalutare, infine, la naturale inclinazione della Manifestazione verso le
politiche giovanili muovendo un gran numero di ragazzi da tutta la regione a
prendere parte, ad esprimersi, a mettersi in gioco nella fiera, riconoscendo
nella propria città, nella propria terra, uno spazio veramente loro,
accogliente, in cui si possano sentire liberi e capiti. </p>
<p>Il <b>LameziaComics&amp;Co... </b>: <i>“uno spazio sano e ricco di positività, nel quale ogni ragazzo si sente
protagonista”.</i></p>
<p>E’ proprio
questo lo spirito con cui noi dell’Associazione Attivamente (all’interno della
quale abbiamo accolto e sono impegnati molti giovani della città) progettiamo,
creiamo, e  proponiamo le nostre
attività.<span><br/></span> </p>

fiera si svolge in tre giorni ed è strutturata in una serie di differenti iniziative,

sia culturali che sociali. Un acculturare divertendosi che i tanti
appassionati del settore, soprattutto i più piccoli, possono fare al Lamezia

<p>We’re <b>ATTIVAMENTE</b>,  a non-Profit Cultural Association from
Lamezia Terme, a bustling town of creativity in Calabria,  in southern Italy.  We’re a a group of  young people operating both in our  city and in our region by promoting and
organising cultural, playful and social events. 
This passion brought us together five years ago – and we’re going strong
today!  </p>
<p>Introducing our hallmark annual event - <b>Lamezia Comics &amp; Co...</b></p>
<p><b></b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/721910/files/20140716112113-lamezia_comics_logo.jpg?1405534873"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The first 
INTERNAZIONAL COMICS and  ANIMATED
FILM CONVENTION  in CALABRIA –
celebrating its 6th year.</p>
<p>Comics, animated films, games, cosplay, music,
workshops, national and international guests: 
Lamezia Comics &amp; Co is the perfect 
event to  let  young people, illustrators, fans and the
overall  curious from southern Italy  meet each other and share their experiences. </p>
<p>Those entering the Lamezia Comics  will  find themselves in an encompassed and interactive
environment  – including  the creative arts, comics and games, with a
significant degree of professional 
attention applied to ensure an authentic experience. Below is a an
example of what those attending Lamezia Comics will take with them this year: </p>
<p>•  <b>Culture</b> -  comics, exhibitions, films, concerts, picture
book launches, meetings  and discussions
with important personalities; incentives for people’s growth, regardless if
you’re young or an adult. </p>
<p>•  <b>Collaboration</b> -  games, entertainment, workshops -  promoting an experience like “ being  together like a family” through meeting
like-minded people with similar 
interests and passions – through the lens of lightheartedness and
creativity. </p>
<p>•  <b>Productivity</b> – space for young artists.
Not only will they have dedicated space, they find someone who trusts them and
provides  them opportunities to  challenge and improve their artistic
abilities . They’ll be given the opportunity to enter the working world
(commission or sale of their works of art). Our purpose is to welcome and
provide space to those entering this fantastic world and experience; our
ambition is to provide rising young talent with increased visibility.</p>

<p></p>
<p>It’s important that we don’t  underestimate 
that our objective is to support youth and the young at heart alike.
Over the past five years, a significant proportion of southern Italian youth
attended the event – feeling involved,

siamo Attivamente, un’associazione culturale no profit di Lamezia Terme, una
ridente
cittadina al centro della Calabria.Siamo
un gruppo di giovani, che opera sul territorio cittadino e regionale da ben cinque anni. Le  passioni che ci accomunano ci hanno portato a riunirci e creare tante
iniziative culturali,ludiche
e sociali.
La più importante è il Lamezia Comics & Co...
prima
RASSEGNA INTERNAZIONALE DEL FUMETTO E CINEMA DI ANIMAZIONE DELLA CALABRIA.

Fumetti, film d'animazione, giochi, cosplay, musica, workshop, ospiti nazionali e internazionali sono la cornice perfetta per dar vita al punto d’incontro
per giovani, disegnatori, appassionati e curiosi di tutta la regione e del sud Italia in generale. 
Entrando al Lamezia
Comics ci si trova catapultati all’interno di uno spazio vitale ed interattivo
che abbraccia sia l'arte, la creatività, ma anche il fumetto e il gioco,  con cura e professionalità le aree
della:


Cultura
     tramite la diffusione di fumetti, mostre, film, concerti, presentazione di
     libri illustrati, incontro e confronto con personalità di rilievo; stimoli per la crescita di ogni persona, giovane o adulta che sia. 

Socialità
     attraverso momenti di gioco, di intrattenimento, work-shop; il tutto è basato sul 
     “gusto dello stare
     con gli altri, come una famiglia”, per conoscere persone con
     gli stessi interessi e passioni. Condividendo un momento che sia di
     spensieratezza ma anche di creatività. 

Produttività dando spazio a giovani artisti, i
     quali tramite noi trovano lo spazio, la fiducia, il desiderio di
     continuare nel loro lavoro o passione che sia e di migliorare le proprie
     qualità artistiche, riuscendo, in fiera, anche ad affacciarsi al mondo del
     lavoro (commissione di lavori o vendita di proprie opere); in
     quest’ambito, il nostro intento è di continuare, sempre più, ad accogliere
     e riuscire a dare spazio alle sterminate realtà regionali che vivono di
     questo mondo fantastico, non riuscendo, spesso, ad avere la giusta
     visibilità.


Da non
sottovalutare, infine, la naturale inclinazione della Manifestazione verso le
politiche giovanili muovendo un gran numero di ragazzi da tutta la regione a
prendere parte, ad esprimersi, a mettersi in gioco nella fiera, riconoscendo
nella propria città, nella propria terra, uno spazio veramente loro,
accogliente, in cui si possano sentire liberi e capiti. 
Il LameziaComics&Co... : “uno spazio sano e ricco di positività, nel quale ogni ragazzo si sente
protagonista”.
E’ proprio
questo lo spirito con cui noi dell’Associazione Attivamente (all’interno della
quale abbiamo accolto e sono impegnati molti giovani della città) progettiamo,
creiamo, e  proponiamo le nostre
attività. 

La
fiera si svolge in tre giorni ed è strutturata in una serie di differenti iniziative,
collegate al mondo fantastico, le quali, utilizzando un canale di comunicazione
efficace verso i giovani quale è il fumetto, li conduce verso aspetti e valori
sia culturali che sociali. Un acculturare divertendosi che i tanti
appassionati del settore, soprattutto i più piccoli, possono fare al Lamezia
Comics & Co: 
“una iniziativa innovativa ed unica, nel suo genere, rispetto
altre proposte culturali attuate dalle varie realtà regionali”.







Area
Game


Nell’Area
Games, saranno presenti Associazioni che organizzano attività ludiche con
tornei di giochi da tavolo e carte collezionabili, video giochi, giochi di ruolo e tutte le novità del mondo ludico.


Area Mostre


Nell’Area

sezione dedicate agli emergenti, talenti calabresi e non,  che hanno la possibilità di
farsi conoscere. Oltre a mostre di illustrazioni ed opere mirate al fumetto,
sarà dato spazio anche ad opere modellistiche; modelli in scala di scorci,
figure, rappresentazioni temporali storiche, ricostruzioni fumettistiche etc
etc.

Area Cinema

Nell’Area Cinema, saranno proiettati film per tutte le età, partendo dal primo pomeriggio fino a tarda notte, dove gli stili e i generi si susseguiranno, dando spazio alle nuove uscite ed ai must dell'animazione e del fantastico in generale.

Nell’Area
Stands saranno presenti tutti gli Autori invitati, che si metteranno a
disposizione degli appassionati, inoltre saranno presenti operatori del settori
quali, fumetterie, librerie e case editrici dove gli appassionati hanno la
possibilità di acquistare le ultime novita’.


Area Workshop ed incontri


Nell’area
Workshop saranno organizzati degli incontri con gli ospiti presenti in fiera, con le scuole di fumetto e con tutte le figure professionali condividendo con i partecipanti la loro esperienza. 


Area Live


L'area Live è la più eclettica della manifestazione, dove gli eventi si susseguono e variano dal combattimento medievale in armatura al concerto della band che ci riporrà tutte le sigle dei cartoni che tanto amiamo, per poi arrivare alla giornata finale dove il suo aspetto muterà ancora trasformandosi nella passerella che ospiterà il contest cosplay. 


La
partecipazione all’evento per i visitatori e’ COMPLETAMENTE GRATUITA a differenza di altre manifestazioni del
genere.


 
10.000,00 € è la cifra che dobbiamo raggiungere per poter realizzare il nostro sogno.

manifestazione potrà essere fruibile a tutti, grandi e piccini, come crediamo
che debbano essere tutte le manifestazioni culturali come il “Lamezia Comics & Co…”.

We’re ATTIVAMENTE,  a non-Profit Cultural Association from
Lamezia Terme, a bustling town of creativity in Calabria,  in southern Italy.  We’re a a group of  young people operating both in our  city and in our region by promoting and
organising cultural, playful and social events. 
This passion brought us together five years ago – and we’re going strong
today!  
Introducing our hallmark annual event - Lamezia Comics & Co...


The first 
INTERNAZIONAL COMICS and  ANIMATED
FILM CONVENTION  in CALABRIA –
celebrating its 6th year.
Comics, animated films, games, cosplay, music,
workshops, national and international guests: 
Lamezia Comics & Co is the perfect 
event to  let  young people, illustrators, fans and the
overall  curious from southern Italy  meet each other and share their experiences. 
Those entering the Lamezia Comics  will  find themselves in an encompassed and interactive
environment  – including  the creative arts, comics and games, with a
significant degree of professional 
attention applied to ensure an authentic experience. Below is a an
example of what those attending Lamezia Comics will take with them this year: 
•  Culture -  comics, exhibitions, films, concerts, picture
book launches, meetings  and discussions
with important personalities; incentives for people’s growth, regardless if
you’re young or an adult. 
•  Collaboration -  games, entertainment, workshops -  promoting an experience like “ being  together like a family” through meeting
like-minded people with similar 
interests and passions – through the lens of lightheartedness and
creativity. 
•  Productivity – space for young artists.
Not only will they have dedicated space, they find someone who trusts them and
provides  them opportunities to  challenge and improve their artistic
abilities . They’ll be given the opportunity to enter the working world
(commission or sale of their works of art). Our purpose is to welcome and
provide space to those entering this fantastic world and experience; our
ambition is to provide rising young talent with increased visibility.


It’s important that we don’t  underestimate 
that our objective is to support youth and the young at heart alike.
Over the past five years, a significant proportion of southern Italian youth
attended the event – feeling involved, 
able to express themselves and confident to take new challenges.  In particular, the youth from Lamezia see
this event as a space for them and the southern Italian community where  everyone is accepted and understood. 
The LameziaComics&Co... : “fostering a healthy and
vibrant environment of positivity, where young individuals are themselves the
main characters.”
It’s through this that the spirit of the Association
Attivamente is driven - where  young
people in our city and southern Italy commit themselves to plan, create
and  participate in our activities. 



LameziaComics&Co 
takes place over three days, organised by a number of different

<p> </p>
<h3><i>Smol Summary</i></h3>
<p>This project was birthed from another zine I created titled Himitsu. Himitsu is the Japanese word for secret, written as ひみつ. Himitsu was a zine where people, mostly young women, would tell me secrets of theirs, both anonymous and known. They shared their experiences on love, hurt, relationships and the like. <br/><br/><strong>Scorpion</strong> is the bigger and better version of Himitsu. Scorpion explores the horror genre alongside these stories on love and hurt. Juxtaposing images of young women covered in blood, looking bad ass as hell alongside interviews where they talk about their broken hearts and secrets. <br/><br/>Scorpion is my child and like a shameless pageant mom, I want to share it with the world. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>What I Need &amp; What You Get</i></h3>
<p>For a broke art student, I have quite big plans for Scorpion. All the funding (<i>£500</i>) will go towards printing the first 100 copies of Scorpion, as well as posters of images within the work. <br/><br/>Many of the people who contribute WILL receive copies of the thick a** zine &amp; I also plan to have a solo exhibition in the month of December and the zine will be available for purchase their as well, along with other goodies e.g stickers, posters, you name it (which will also be available to contributors here). <br/><br/>If I do not reach my goal, I will still print copies of the zine, but possibly around 50 or less, which will still be available to contributors and also for purchase at the end of the year. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>The Impact</i></h3>
<p>Scorpion is really a zine made for women and by women, although men it's for you too, but the content within it is to empower women. The media is somehow always out to get women, pitting us against each other, telling us what's ""right"" for us or how we should act. This zine is basically saying to hell with that, we can do and act however we want to. We can be hardcore as hell and also vulnerable in the same breath and that's what I'm exploring within this project. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564289929/rd5upipdhqvkml6edwsq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>Risks</i></h3>
<p>There are very few risks or challenges at the moment regarding the publishing of the zine. The only challenge really is seeing as this my first zine I will be self publishing, I will be handling everything on my won. If all goes well,  it should be published by November and out for shipping by December and early January. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're unable to contribute, that's A-okay, sharing the word on social media will help a bunch. Instagram, facebook, Tumblr, heck even Myspace. I would greatly appreciate that. </p>

We can be hardcore as hell and also vulnerable in the same breath and that's what I'm exploring within this project. 
 

Risks
There are very few risks or challenges at the moment regarding the publishing of the zine. The only challenge really is seeing as this my first zine I will be self publishing, I will be handling everything on my won. If all goes well,  it should be published by November and out for shipping by December and early January.

<p>“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I am a recipient of the Fellowship of Man Award for being an entrepreneur in the arts. My life's work and passion is in helping marginalized youth develop their creative potential. Through my extensive research, and vast experience as an arts administrator for over 30 years, I discovered that the working world of the future will require all of us to be more entrepreneurial, work independantly, collaboratively and creatively.</p>
<p>This book provides the information needed to function in this new world of work.</p>
<p>I intend to use the concepts from this book once published to further develop videos, an audio book and a special mentorship and training pilot program for disadvantaged youth in downtown Toronto and other neighbourhoods through NewArts a non profit organization.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>We Need</strong></p>
<p>We need $1,500 to have my final draft edited by a professional, design a book cover, convert and upload my files on Bookbaby who will distribute to all the major ebook retailers including Amazon, print one hundred hard copies and cover costs for a book launch.</p>
<p>As a contibutor you can be aknowledged in the credits, receive free copies of the book at our launch, or have the book mailed to you and get the first copy of the ebook, get invited to the launch and be introduced to the audience.</p>
<p>If I am unable to reach my entire goal I will determine if there is enough to do at a minimum upload the ebook to Kindle for distribution on Amazon, if all else fails the money will help NewArts a not for profit organization continue to develop new arts and emerging talents.</p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>With my connections to youth organizations and through the ebook's wide distribution on all the major ebook retail sites, this book will reach countless individuals to help them develop their creative potential, live healthier, and productive lives in the new world of work. The skills they will aquire can be applied to solving many of our worlds problems.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>The People Behind the Animals </i>is a book focusing on the lesser-known fields of veterinary medicine as well as incredible stories of people around the world working with animals in different ways.<br/><br/>My name is Abby Lipiner and I am the author of <i>The People Behind the Animals</i>. I wrote this book because there are people doing amazing things with and for animals every day that no one is talking about. I think it’s important that their stories are told and that animal lovers learn about the different ways they can work with animals.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that wanting to be a veterinarian does not have to limit you to the standard private practice work with dogs and cats and that if you love animals, there are ways to help them outside of committing to the years of schooling that becoming a veterinarian requires. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for animals and the veterinary industry in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you find the right outlet for your love for animals and even create a new one if it doesn’t yet exist.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about veterinarians that chose a non-traditional line of work and different people and organizations that are working with animals in ways we could have never imagined, including:<ul>
<li>How Dr. Karen Phillips discovered her love of shelter medicine and was inspired to open her own farm animal sanctuary, Hope Haven.</li>
<li>How Paul Barton turned a passion for music into a source of love and calmness for elephants in Thailand who have lived lives of loss, abuse, and neglect.</li>
<li>How one man’s love of rats led to the foundation of an organization, APOPO, dedicated to saving human lives through the use of landmine and tuberculosis detection at the hands, or paws, of rats.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you want to become a veterinarian or even if you just love animals.<br/><br/><i>The People Behind the Animals</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to aspiring veterinary students and all animal lovers who are looking at the different areas of veterinary work and awe-inspiring ways that people work with animals around the world for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - <i>The People Behind the Animals</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts...<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + additional chapters 1-5. These chapters focus on the evolution and domestication of animals as well as the evolution of a rapidly growing field of veterinary medicine. This section also dives into the first kind of nontraditional animal work, the ways that animals are trained to help humans. You will read about therapy and service animal programs falling outside of the typical service dog mold and the important work APOPO’s HeroRats are doing overseas to protect and save lives.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 6-9. In this section, you will read about veterinarians who went outside the stereotypical cat and dog family practice route. These veterinarians work with all different kinds of animals in both traditional hospital and non-traditional outdoor/wild settings like the Gorilla Doctors who dedicate their lives to saving mountain gorillas; the most endangered subspecies of gorillas.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 10-12. This section looks beyond the world of veterinary medicine and focuses on other ways people are helping animals. In these chapters, you’ll learn all about different animal sanctuaries, the healing power music has on animals and all about Steve Irwin and his family’s work.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July of 2020</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for my Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this summer</li>
</ul> When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish</li>
<li>A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</li>
<li>Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)</li>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p><br/>Abby Lipiner is an aspiring veterinary student majoring in natural sciences with minors in chemistry and administration of justice from the University of Pittsburgh. During her junior year, she interned at the Lozito Laboratory where she oversaw husbandry of the lab’s reptiles and amphibians. In addition to volunteering with various animal rescues, she also volunteers at different animal hospitals. An animal lover since birth, she can still recall correctly diagnosing her guinea pig with pneumonia when she was nine years old after reading every book she could find on guinea pig health when her pet started to seem sick. She was born to be a veterinarian; it just took some time for her to figure this out.<br/><br/>She wrote this book because she has a passion for exotic animals and wants to share it with other people. There are so many extraordinary people helping animals that aren’t getting the attention and appreciation they deserve; she wants to share their stories.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Abby at abby.lipiner@yahoo.com, @abby_lipiner on twitter, and as Abby Lipiner on Facebook.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>
<p> </p>

Please use #ThePeopleBehindTheAnimals and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so we can help amplify your efforts.</p>
<p>You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page</p>

You will read about therapy and service animal programs falling outside of the typical service dog mold and the important work APOPO’s HeroRats are doing overseas to protect and save lives.Part 2 contains Chapters 6-9. In this section, you will read about veterinarians who went outside the stereotypical cat and dog family practice route. These veterinarians work with all different kinds of animals in both traditional hospital and non-traditional outdoor/wild settings like the Gorilla Doctors who dedicate their lives to saving mountain gorillas; the most endangered subspecies of gorillas.Part 3 contains Chapters 10-12. This section looks beyond the world of veterinary medicine and focuses on other ways people are helping animals. In these chapters, you’ll learn all about different animal sanctuaries, the healing power music has on animals and all about Steve Irwin and his family’s work.

I have produced four Banana Tail books that have been sold through Barnes &amp; Noble, as well as comic book stores around the country. Banana Tail's stable of books ranges from the original comic-sized picture book titled Banana Tail to the most recent Halloween-themed BOOnana Tail's Halloween Special (see below). Diamond Distributors added a ""spotlight"" to the BOO comic and helped it get more notice and sell quite well. BOO was developed to grow with young readers that had the earlier storybooks read to them as toddlers. I've taken Banana Tail and Friends outside of the publishing realm and have created t-shirts, coffee mugs, BBQ aprons, superhero prints and jigsaw puzzles featuring the characters.</p><p>The series also includes Banana Tail's Tales and Activities book and Banana Tail's Colorful Adventure (Image Comics) computer-generated hard cover.

Congrats on your characters having such an impact on my daughter, as I’m sure they will on many other children.”</p><p>— Debbie Magsamen<br/>        The Mother of Banana Tail’s #1 fan</p><p>~~~</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/bUwIB-a3pbg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>Check this 37 second film out created by the team who brought you Banana Tail's Colorful Adventure...Full Sail University!!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>SUPER HERO PRINTS!</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584315843/omoswa4efzdo7hyfuxi4.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584315854/zvbm1b4fofc9xokgdi4p.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE OTHER BOOKS!</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584315938/rauypnejb1ao2s0crjq4.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The CGI illustrated Banana Tail's Colorful Adventure</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584315965/csvl5zhgdtdif9p0obpz.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Tales and Activities</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584315984/hykibqewucljknwhbntl.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The BOOnana Tail Halloween Special cover #1</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584315996/kygl6bo7a1zxikq9wzq0.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Boo Cover #2</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584316009/g1n89svrlmbbowszh1jf.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>BOO Cover #3</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584316041/nbj0lmrjpc9m8bmsbrrv.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The original storybook</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593972760/zduqhurtxuv1jaxz05vi.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Sketch Covers</i></p><p><strong>Risks, Challenges, CoVid-19 Updates &amp; Indiegogo</strong></p><p>Banana Tail and the Checkerboard Jungle is my 5th Btail project and I've had very little concerns with risks since I've been successful at crowd funding my past projects.

But if you consider the sheer amount of submissions to the actual amount of kids books that get published every year, it's quite the contrast. Thousands of submissions compared to hundreds that ""may"" see print.I created Banana Tail back in the late 1990s with my dear old departed dad and he's never gotten to see that his son, me, developed his idea into a beloved children's book series for those familiar with it. I started out submitting Banana Tail to staples in the children's book market like Little Golden Books, Little, Brown, and Simon & Schuster and got very close to getting a contract with a few of them. It was eye-opening to say the least, but these ""near misses"" helped me realize I had something worthy.I pressed forward and with the help of my lengthy career in comic books and some name recognition, I was able to get some support from comic book and review sites that saw one of their own branching outside the world of superheroes and into unfamiliar territory. And now, here we are 17 years after self-publishing the first title in a series of books I had imagined in the world of Banana Tail. I have produced four Banana Tail books that have been sold through Barnes & Noble, as well as comic book stores around the country. Banana Tail's stable of books ranges from the original comic-sized picture book titled Banana Tail to the most recent Halloween-themed BOOnana Tail's Halloween Special (see below). Diamond Distributors added a ""spotlight"" to the BOO comic and helped it get more notice and sell quite well. BOO was developed to grow with young readers that had the earlier storybooks read to them as toddlers. I've taken Banana Tail and Friends outside of the publishing realm and have created t-shirts, coffee mugs, BBQ aprons, superhero prints and jigsaw puzzles featuring the characters.The series also includes Banana Tail's Tales and Activities book and Banana Tail's Colorful Adventure (Image Comics) computer-generated hard cover. The first two books focused on Banana Tail himself and Reena, the young mood color-changing rhino. Rounding out the trio of best friends is Tic Tac, the plaid zebra featured in Banana Tail and The Checkerboard Jungle.~~~PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU DON'T SEE AN ITEM YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN, CERTAINLY ASK ABOUT IT. IF IT'S MANAGEABLE, IT'LL GET DONE! Least I forget... A few years back I created a Banana Tail art portfolio enlisting some of today's top illustrators. Comic legend WALTER SIMONSON leads the way with an illustrated and hand colored Banana Tail and Tic Tac. Following Walter is top cover artist Greg Horn, luminaries Jim Calafiore, Shawn McManus, Sara Richard and Kristen Sorra. I tell you this why? READ ON...*BONUS NOTE* Pledges OVER $30 will automatically receive the unsigned ""suitable for framing"" Banana Tail print portfolio.Pledges over $50 will receive the ""signed and numbered"" Banana Tail print portfolio.

My 3 year old daughter loves this book. The pictures are wonderful, much more interesting to her than most children’s book illustrations, and the text is great, too. She has several hundred books and loves many. Every night, she gets to pick 3 stories to have read before she sleeps. This is the first time that she wanted me to read one story 3 times. Get it. Now.”— Anonymous Mother~~~~“Author Mark McKenna has created unique colorful characters with telling expressions in his book Banana Tail; capturing both my imagination and the imagination of my six year old son. McKenna not only takes us on an wondrous adventure in this story, but reminds us of an important moral–acceptance.”— Jennifer O’Connor        ReporterWarwick Valley Dispatch~~~“I need to purchase 7 more copies of Banana Tail to give as Christmas presents. My daughter Erin does not go crazy over many books or videos. She has Banana Tail up there with Elmo. When I went on the Banana Tail website at home, Erin went crazy! She wouldn’t let me close out of it and when I did she cried for 5 minutes. I think that’s a great sign. She loves it…maybe even more then Elmo. She never went to bed clutching an Elmo book before!
