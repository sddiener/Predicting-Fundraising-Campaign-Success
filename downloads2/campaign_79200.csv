<h3>Who is Mala Greña? </h3>
<p>A seed was planted by an ancestral spirit or energy. From the seed, encased in bone and darkness, its roots desperately took hold. From flesh and blood, roots and branches grew. Its flowers manifested themselves to Greñudx in the form of sound - a sound that demanded and embodied transformation, bringing self awareness and healing.</p>
<p>It reverberated through space, resonating with the other musicians, all on their own journeys of transformation. Together as roots, nurturing these connections, they tore through the ground, flowering Mala Greña’s mystical essence.</p>
<p>The lineup formed.</p>
<p>Grenudx, a Xicane sound arranger from the Bay Area, is the originator of the project's sonic signature style. With an experimental, no rules needed approach, they give this sound life on stage through guitar and keys/melodica.      </p>
<p>Mala Grena’s conga player is Jesus, a U.S. veteran of Puerto Rican/Mexican descent. He bridges the traditional musical roots with the more experimental aspects of the sound. </p>
<p>Oscar, of Chilean ascent; is the band’s drummer. With a strong background in heavy metal, progressive and traditional rock sounds, his arrangements ignite the gritty, energetic aspect of the music. </p>
<p>Gi, on the bass, is a queer non binary composer and musician living in the Bay Area. With experience in a broad variety of genres, from jazz, to classical, to ambient, to cumbia, their mastery in the bass is the backbone of the sound, the timekeeper of the vibe.</p>
<p>Flama is the lead vocalist; a Costarican queer non binary performer, dj and producer; their lyrics and performance give you a glimpse into their spirit: anti-establishment, unapologetic, trance-like - a place where identities merge. Their contribution is the lyrical and corporal interpretation of the music.          </p>
<p>Their musical work is influenced by artists in the likes of The Mars Volta, Chicha Libre, Sonido Gallo Negro, Caifanes, Aterciopelados, XIXA, ZZK Records and Combo Chimbita. </p>
<p>Mala Greña’s sound and performance has begun picking up the attention from the Bay Area’s musical community. They’ve played in an array of popular venues, such as the San José Ritz, the Uptown, and the Elbo Room in SF and Oakland. They’ve also brought their music to well renowned events such as the San José Jazz Festival, with support from the Sonido Clash crew, the California State Fair, for Out At The Fair, and La Diáspora Festival at the Mission district in San Francisco. They’ve shared the stage with Turbo Sonidero, La Misa Negra, LoCura, Calafia Armada, Fulminante, Extra Action Marching Band, Valley Wolf, and more. </p>

The first, featured here in a live video, is ""Lonely Island,"" our homage to mental health/depression awareness from our Earth Day 2019 EP, Thoughts & Prayers. With the grant, we can start this initial video this Spring including taping, editing, effects, imagery, animation, still art, space rental, props, and more. Increased funding will mean greater artistry and possibly additional videos for other tracks like ""Thoughts & Prayers"" (anti-gun violence), ""New Army"" (climate change awareness), ""Terror Nation"" (inclusiveness, anti-discrimination & social justice).TO FUND THESE PROJECTS AND TO SPREAD OUR PROGRESSIVE 21ST CENTURY SOCIO-POLITICAL MESSAGES THROUGH ART AND MUSIC, WE ARE OFFERING SPECIAL PACAKGES OF LD'S MERCHANDISE FOR OUR 20TH ANNIVERSARY (August 2021). Please join us in our vision by purchasing cool merch (CDs/EPs, jewelry, keyrings, buttons/magnets, patches, etc. Even a performance!) for yourself, for others...and so we can produce more music & videos, which of course will be available in the near future!Our original goal for four videos was $3-5k. With the grant, we are short $500 for just one. Switching gears, if we succeed in reaching our $3k+ goal, we will look to recording both new music and videos in 2021 and beyond. By contributing to our projects, you will be backing songs of protest and social justice from climate awareness/environmental sustainability, mental health awareness, and immigration and police reform to the #METOO, LGBTQ+, anti-bullying, anti-gun violence, and anti-fascist movements of today. Regardless of our success, you will be supporting the creation of music and art for you to share, use to educate, and simply enjoy; your money will not be wasted...and you'll have cool stuff - including free videos online - in return (just give us your email address so we can send you a copy of it online!: lucretiasdaggers@rcn.com)Please see the Lucretia's Daggers and Bandcamp websites for our music and visuals: https://www.lucretiasdaggers.com, https://lucretiasdaggers.bandcamp.com/album/tho...And to purchase (or get FREE) Downloads: https://lucretiasdaggers.com/downloads - $1-10Merch Packages for Lucretia's Daggers 20th Anniversary Music/Video Fundraiser (also cash donations via Paypal @ lucretiasdaggers@hotmail.com):1.  Thoughts & Prayers EP - Produced at Waltham Watch City Earth Day 2019, (62) EPs printed in Eco Wallets using recycled paper & vegetable-based inks. 5 tracks: ""Thoughts & Prayers"" (anti-gun violence), ""New Army"" (climate change), ""Lonely Island"" (depression/despair to hope), ""Toxic Leaders"" (bad bosses), ""Drawn & Quartered"" (bad relationships).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are working on  launching a pilot docuseries reflecting the story of Hal,  who has been making a living playing music in Las Vegas for the last 15 years. Now, with his entire family along for the ride, kids and everything, we will be going on tour to pursue his dreams of playing his own original music. </p>
<p>Added to the authentic underdog plot is an exploration of cities through music like Anthony Bourdain did with food. HELP us turn our idea for the show <i>Highway to Hal </i>into a reality.  </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Our short term goal is to raise at least $18,000. These initial  funds will be used to create a pilot episode to show networks, sponsors, and producers as we hit the road on our 6 weeklong tour.   </p>
<p>Here is how the funds will be used: </p>
<ul>
<li>Film Crew</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
<li>Lodging / Meals</li>
<li> Marketing</li>
<li>Social Media Re-Branding </li>
<li>Content Creation </li>
<li>Merchandise </li>
<li>Video Editing </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Live music is an important part of our world. Hal is currently hosting original talent showcases in Las Vegas as a way to recognize up and coming artists. Now, he will be able to highlight amazing artists and music venues across the country. </p>
<p><u>Structure of each episode (subject to change):</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Music influencers will meet Hal and give him insight about their city /  experiences.</li>
<li>Have a front row seat to some of the countries unique venues as Hal lights up their stages.  </li>
<li>Embedded in each episode will be genuine family experiences.</li>
<li>A new Hal original song will be released in each episode. </li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are working on  launching a pilot docuseries reflecting the story of Hal,  who has been making a living playing music in Las Vegas for the last 15 years. Now, with his entire family along for the ride, kids and everything, we will be going on tour to pursue his dreams of playing his own original music. 
Added to the authentic underdog plot is an exploration of cities through music like Anthony Bourdain did with food. HELP us turn our idea for the show Highway to Hal into a reality.  
 
What We Need

Our short term goal is to raise at least $18,000. These initial  funds will be used to create a pilot episode to show networks, sponsors, and producers as we hit the road on our 6 weeklong tour.   
Here is how the funds will be used: 

Film Crew
Transportation
Lodging / Meals
 Marketing
Social Media Re-Branding 
Content Creation 
Merchandise 
Video Editing 

 
The Impact

Live music is an important part of our world. Hal is currently hosting original talent showcases in Las Vegas as a way to recognize up and coming artists. Now, he will be able to highlight amazing artists and music venues across the country. 
Structure of each episode (subject to change):

Music influencers will meet Hal and give him insight about their city /  experiences.
Have a front row seat to some of the countries unique venues as Hal lights up their stages.  
Embedded in each episode will be genuine family experiences.
A new Hal original song will be released in each episode.

 Vintage Jukebox Orchestra (VJO) is an orchestra dedicated to the music of the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and early 60s!
The VJO is one-of-a-kind orchestra - the repertoire is very ambitious - the repertoire includes in fact 3 different and distinct repertoire - it would usually take 3 different bands to cover all of them - we do it with one!
- Gypsy Jazz / Jazz Manouche: this is a style of jazz music started by guitarist Jean ""Django"" Reinhardt in the 1930s. He later collaborated with violinist Stéphane Grappelli!
- Traditional Jazz / Dixieland / New Orleans R&B: there are festive, toe-tapping beats of New Orleans traditional jazz and dixieland music.  Featuring 20s and 30s repertoire from such luminaries as Bix Beiderbeck, Clarence Williams, Fats Waller, Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong.- Big Band Era / Classic Swing: it was made popular by the famous orchestras of Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford, Fletcher Henderson, and Artie Shaw  as well as the songs of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald to name just a few.  The repertoire includes an extensive catalogue of standards from the Great American Songbook, featuring the works of legendary songwriters: Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Rodgers & Hammerstein, Cahn & Van Heusen, Julie Styne, the Gershwins and their peers.This campaign is so important for us to take the orchestra to the next level - the only way to get there is to shoot a professional promotional video of the band performing all that music in the different configurations we are able to! We'll feature the band from a 4 piece to a 12 piece band!Indeed, nowadays, audio samples, to promote such a large band, are no longer enough - booking agents and promoters for concerts, music series and corporate functions want to see and hear what the band sounds and looks like!
And this is where you come in! Help us make this orchestra a project come true!You love one or all the repertoires listed above and would like to help us make it available to more listeners!If you live in the Greater Bay Area (including the Sacramento area), you'll get a chance to see the band perform live!If you live far away, you will probably enjoy some of our video but also we'll stream over the internet one of our future live performances!!But no matter where you are, you will be able to listen and enjoy our music from the comfort of your own home!

What We Need & What You Get
 We need $4000 to get us started!Once the budget is raised and invested, the band should be self-sufficient financially to run on its own and cover future expenses!!
Take a look on the side at the different perks you will be receiving and see below how we will invest the money!
$4000 will be spent as follow:$1,300: One day recording studio time with audio engineer + mixing all the songs$300: Additional Lighting + backdrop$600: One day video shoot + editing$400: Catered lunch the day of the recording$50: Rehearsal space rental$300: additional horns players hired for the day of the recording (for the 6-horns section)$200: Black band stands$800: 20 charts for 3 & 6 horns
What if we go over $4000?
Well, that would be a nice thing to deal with. Depending on the amount raised, we'll consider:- recording a live album- adding a stage backdrop and some stage props for our live concerts- invest in some additional custom arrangements

We thank you for reading, for sharing with friends and family members and for contributing to this project! And more importantly, we look forward to sharing our love of this music with all of you!

Some of you may know me from a few years ago when I released my ""Takeoff"" EP. It included my singles, like ""Namedropper"", ""Romeo"" and ballad ""Safe Here Now"". I was blessed to get radio play in a lot of the west coast markets, in which ""Namedropper"" was the number 1 song on one of those station for a full month. ""Romeo"" followed and received even more radio exposure. </p>
<p>As things calmed down from the release of this EP. I found myself without a label, without management, and unsure if I was even good enough to be a recording artist. Although at first this was heartbreaking, it was actually a blessing in disguise. I have spent the past two years experiencing life, listening to others stories, and experiences. I got the opportunity to be there for my supporters in their dark times, and learn with them, and from them. I found myself both personally and musically.</p>
<p>After all of this it became clear that my music wasn't meant to be just music, and it's not about me. It is a catalyst to opening doors to peoples hearts, and let them know life is going to be okay and that they have a purpose. I want my music, and my life to be dedicated to reminding my generation and the generations to come, that they have the power to do great things for our world.</p> </div> <div> <h3>HOW YOU CAN HELP</h3> <p>A few years ago I started an album, but it was placed on hold. I would like to finish that album with the songs I have written the past few years from the lessons I've learned. I would like to then take the music and travel around to schools, malls, and other venues throwing concerts/inspirational talks inspiring my generation to come together and fight for our world. We face so many struggles these days and it is up to my generation to change what is wrong. I believe we need to stop separating ourselves from each other, and start coming together again, because together great things happen, and obstacles are destroyed. We celebrate our freedoms, but forget those that fought for them. We base our lives on ""things"",  and forget what's truely irreplacable. We give beauty power, and it distracts us from what matters. We need to remember what life is really about.</p>
<p>I am asking for any help you may be able to give me in my effort to complete what I believe is my purpose. I am setting the bar high at 10k. This will help me not only record the songs I have written, but also take me to schools, malls, etc to spread the message to my generation. I honestly don't know if I can reach this goal, but I figure it's worth a shot. With your help, we can do amazing things!</p>
<p>IndieGoGo allows us to keep the funds even if we don't reach our goal. In the event I don't reach the goal, I will take the lemons, and make the best dang lemonade I can make with your generous contributions. </p>
<p>In the event I exceed my goal, I will put all of those funds into taking my outreach tour to as many places as I can, and to as many youth as I can. It's all about spreading the message that it is up to us to change the world. </p>

<h3>ME and THIS ALBUM</h3>
<p>Since moving to Nashville in 2010 it has been my #1 goal to produce some of the best music I could possibly write and record! The reason behind this goal has always been the same; to be able to give you, my fans, my heart in musical form. </p>
<p>During the past year or so I have grown both emotionally and mentally as a musician, writer, and overall human-being. I have rediscovered both my musical roots and myself as an artist/musician in general. In early January my team and I started working on a new single titled ""Let Me In"", and on March 3rd we released it via iTunes, Bandcamp, and just about digital platform! In a little less than a week it hit 1000 plays on Soundclound; it hit 2000 plays the next week. It is now close to 3000 plays. All I can say is thank you SO much!</p>
<p>I'm both thrilled and excited to announce my plans for a new Zach Ummer EP.</p>
<h3>THIS ALBUM</h3>
<p>In the last year or so I have written a number of songs; each one dealing with their own share of heartbreak, emotional healing and overall self discovery. The time I have put into each one of them scares me every time I think about it! <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">These songs are pieces of me. They are raw, honest, and straight from my heart to yours.<b> </b></span></p>
<p>During the last few years I have been inspired by many styles of music, but the one thing that they all have in common is the way they were recorded; to tape using analog equipment. I believe this is the best way to present these songs to you.</p>
<p>ANALOG?: Today, many bands use a digital interface and computer to record their albums. I want to make it the old school way. I want it to sound warm and full of emotion and grit; think about how Taylor Swift's ""1989"" sounds and then compare it to Fleetwood Mac's ""Rumours"". </p>
<p>I want to make a record that sounds just as amazing as ""Rumours""! </p>
</div><div>

<span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/>
</div>
<div>Every contribution of $5 or more to this project will serve as a pre-order for the album itself. I truly want YOU to have this music! Every contribution made will get you an immediate copy of ""Let Me In""!</div>
<div>For this album to succeed it needs to sound right; this means I need to hire the right people/musicians, record it in the most appropriate studio, and use the right equipment (vintage mics, guitars, amps, drums) to achieve the sounds we need. </div>
<div>THIS ALL COSTS MONEY! </div>
<div>
<b>Allow me to be as transparent as possible (where your money is going)</b>:</div>
<div>Album = 6 Songs (including ""Let Me In""):</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<li>2 days of studio time at Fry Pharmacy Recording — $800</li>
<li>5 songs with 7 fantastic musicians — $1900</li>
<li>Tracking 5 songs with an audio engineer — $1140</li>
<li>Edits and mixing — $1100</li>
<li>Album Mastering — $350</li>
<li>Album CD pressing and distribution — $1000-$1300</li>
<li>Merch and countless string breakage — $250-$400 </li>

</div>
<div>In addition to all this expensive stuff, there are a whole bunch of other give aways that cost $0.00; things that I will be making using my graphic design skills, musical things that nobody but me has heard, and personal things from me to you!<br/>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Obviously, like all great projects worth doing, there are some risks and some challenges. It takes a lot for me to do this campaign. I paid my own money to record the video for it! $7000 is an extremely large amount of money, but look at it this way: </p>
<p><b>If 1000 people all decided to donate 7 dollars, we could start working on this album. If 500 people all decided to donate $14 we would hit the goal as well! </b></p>
<p>Though $7000 is our goal, the more money we raise, the more we can do for you!</p>

SHARE! </b>That is the most important thing you can do (even if you choose not to contribute) to help this project come to life; the more people that see this campaign the better!

<p></p>We are
a group of young people from a small town in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina where
nothing ever happens. In order to change that we have decided to organize a
small electronic music festival. <br/>
We wish to gather as many people as we can to share a great experience. <br/>
This won't include only people from our town or even country but people from
all over the Balkans and if possible Europe. <br/>
Since there wasn't anything similar in this part of Bosnia for a long
time,this would be a huge deal. <p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>Our
minimum goal is 4000 dollars. The funding goes to the acquiring of the necessary
permits for the location of the festival,renting of the stage,musical
equipment,fees for the musicians as well as the security for the festival. <br/>
Our exact budget will be updated as we find out the exact prices for
everything. <br/>
If the goal is suppressed,all the extra money will go to acquiring more stage
acts. <br/>
If the goal is not met we will still try to organize the festival,albeit on a
smaller scale.  </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<span>HOLY
CRAP PEOPLE ! Do you have any idea how much this would mean to all of us living
here?  <br/>
Nothing ever happens here, so at the least this would wake a sleepy town up, at
the best we could have another Woodstock.<br/>
We plan on bringing DJ's from all over the Balkans <br/>
The experience would have a huge impact on the whole region. </span> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<span>Our
main problem would be the weather. Since it would be an open air festival, rain

</span><p></p></div>","Short Summary
We are
a group of young people from a small town in Bosnia & Herzegovina where
nothing ever happens. In order to change that we have decided to organize a
small electronic music festival. 
We wish to gather as many people as we can to share a great experience. 
This won't include only people from our town or even country but people from
all over the Balkans and if possible Europe. 
Since there wasn't anything similar in this part of Bosnia for a long
time,this would be a huge deal.    What We Need & What You Get Our
minimum goal is 4000 dollars. The funding goes to the acquiring of the necessary
permits for the location of the festival,renting of the stage,musical
equipment,fees for the musicians as well as the security for the festival. 
Our exact budget will be updated as we find out the exact prices for
everything. 
If the goal is suppressed,all the extra money will go to acquiring more stage
acts. 
If the goal is not met we will still try to organize the festival,albeit on a
smaller scale.    The Impact 
HOLY
CRAP PEOPLE ! Do you have any idea how much this would mean to all of us living
here?  
Nothing ever happens here, so at the least this would wake a sleepy town up, at
the best we could have another Woodstock.
We plan on bringing DJ's from all over the Balkans 
The experience would have a huge impact on the whole region.    Risks & Challenges  
Our
main problem would be the weather. Since it would be an open air festival, rain
could cause us huge headaches. Apart from that there should be no bigger
problems.   Other Ways You Can Help 
If
you're not able to donate we would be very grateful if you could spread the
message to people who could be interested. Come on people help some poor Slavs out!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Small, local opera companies like Opera Forza are thriving, choosing to focus solely on the artistic value of their productions. Our motto, ""An ear to the past, an eye to the future"" places emphasis on the golden age of opera, when singing and acting were the most important aspect, without a need for multi-million dollar sets and costumes. We hope to return to these ideals, renewing a love and appreciation for an art form that speaks to our most fundamental and visceral emotions as human beings.</p>
<p>Opera Forza made its debut last August with a performance of Madama Butterfly. On a shoestring budge, the company was able to deliver an exciting and moving performance that left the audience asking for more. There IS a demand for this art form in Northern NJ. </p>

What We Need & What You Get To mount our next operatic production, we need to raise $10,000.00   This helps fund the orchestra, conductor, singers, costumes, and other artistic staff and supplies to make for a thrilling operatic experience. Contributors who donate $1500.00 or more will participate in a ""meet & greet"" cocktail hour with the performers of our next production.  If we do not reach our entire goal, the performance will be reduced to a piano concert production or abridged version with chamber ensemble.    The Impact Grand opera is not a dying art form. Small, local opera companies like Opera Forza are thriving, choosing to focus solely on the artistic value of their productions. Our motto, ""An ear to the past, an eye to the future"" places emphasis on the golden age of opera, when singing and acting were the most important aspect, without a need for multi-million dollar sets and costumes. We hope to return to these ideals, renewing a love and appreciation for an art form that speaks to our most fundamental and visceral emotions as human beings.
Opera Forza made its debut last August with a performance of Madama Butterfly. On a shoestring budge, the company was able to deliver an exciting and moving performance that left the audience asking for more. There IS a demand for this art form in Northern NJ.

For over a decade, I have been active in metal music scene. With my bands, I released 8 studio albums and singles and had the chance to tour Europe, share the stage with names like Blind Guardian, Dream Theater, Anathema, Opeth and more. And I had the chance to work with talented musicians from different bands like Hansi Kürsch (of Blind Guardian), Tim Ripper Owens (of ex. Judas Priest and Iced Earth), Jon Oliva (of Savatage, JoP and Trans Siberian Orchestra) and many more.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I am not a touring artist and album sales are never enough to compensate the album expenses, set aside make a living. In the past, I was able to juggle my finances, even if at a bare minimum, and produce albums on my own by doing everything on my own (from design to accounting, engineering to playing and singing, sending packages to PR). However, because of economic instability of my country - I live in Turkey - against Euro and USD currencies, it became impossible to sustain this balance even if I do everything on my own. Therefore, I am in need of your help to be able to complete the second Maegi album; Tales from the King's Court.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Where does the money go?</h3> <p>Here is a short list of expenses and why they are needed to be able to complete the project.</p> <ul> <li>The average cost of recording an album in a good studio environment takes around 5.000 USD. This includes studio rates, session player expenses and equipment. I am willing to work with a rather well known drummer for progressive metal fans and to be able to achieve this, I need to be able to pay the studio.</li>
<li>About 2.000 USD is needed for an album with 11 tracks to be  mastered with quality. I am hoping to work with Sterling Sound NY as I did in the past in order to be able to present you the best possible outcome.</li>
<li>And another 3.000 USD is needed to be able to manufacture the albums, including the legal paperwork and expenses regarding the pressing of the CDs as well as the booklets and artwork.</li>
<li>A certain amount from these sums (around 15 - 20%) will be deducted as tax and campaign expenses of IndieGoGo.</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I will also try and add as much as I can to the pool and raise the necessary sums.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>What if you exceed these amounts as income?</h3>Here are some tiers to be added if we exceed the necessary amounts. These expenses are rough (but educated) estimates.</div>
<div>
<p>- 12.000 USD -&gt; better mixing with an industry

<p>- 16.000 USD -&gt; a music video for one of the
songs of you, the listeners' pick!</p>

<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Why your help matters more than worlds?</h3>
<div>I was involved in music all my life and I always wanted to present people my music as an album they can listen to and discover long after its production date. Nowadays, it is mostly about making home-made music videos and going online. I respect that, but it is not who I am. I want to create an album, a story or stories to tell you and share them with you. With your help, this can happen.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I work as a graphical designer and the money I make is not even enough to keep the house afloat if we didn't work together with my SO. In the past, I was able to produce my albums with some careful financial planning and lots, LOTS of hardwork. The planning and hard working traits are still there, but since our currency lost almost 40% of its value against USD in the last few years, it is no longer an option to fight everything on my own. Together, we can win this battle.</div>

<h3>Album guests</h3>Maegi’s
Skies Fall had guests. I would be happy to feature new names with the second
disc but I am leaving this option outside of this campaign as the appearance of
a guest is highly dependent on the artists involved rather than me and it may
affect the production calendar. For example, when we were working with Hansi
Kürsch (Blind Guardian) for the first time back in 2007, he had to postpone his
recordings six times due to various reasons (even a tornado hit the studio he
was recording once!). Therefore, I am willing to reserve this “aspect” of the
album as a possible surprise. There may be guests or I may be the only artist
performing the album. In any case, I will try and present you the very best. (Hint: if we can pull this off, there are some names I am already talking to ;) )<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The album production will be completed no matter what as I
am a seasoned producer and artist with already 8 releases under my belt and as
a musician who had worked with metal music’s important names in the past, near
to other contributions on different artists’ albums. I am also an endorsed Steinberg artist. The aim of this campaign
is to collect the funds necessary forehand to be able to create the artistic
freedom rather than doing more accounting than recording. </p>
<p>The majority of the recordings will be done in my own home
studio, therefore the accessibility and production time will be as productive
as possible. The album artwork is already being done by Yiğit Köroğlu, who also did the cover arts for Maegi's first album and my first book.  Certain preliminary dialogues with other studios for the
“better mixing option” milestone was already underway long before this campaign and as I stated earlier, I already have one hell of a drummer to work with if things go well. Therefore, this album is
happening.</p>
<p>The only risk is that, people may not like my music and
there is nothing I can do about it as it is a matter of taste. However, as this
is neither Maegi’s nor my first album, the listeners can have an insight about
how the album will sound. There are also demo-session videos available to better
judge the process and I will upload more following the campaign.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Release Date</h3>
<p>This may be a challenge with lots of production values
added. However, the last time for Maegi’s first album and the collector’s
edition box (with a novella as well), without any funds raised, I was able to
release the album with two months delay, which was announced way forehand as a
possibility due to the calendar hitting the holiday season and certain third
party organizations and services were unavailable due to holidays (like the Ministry of Culture's Copyright department, which is responsible for authorizing the necessary legal certificate of printing an audio CD)</p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>You cannot contribute financially but want to help?</h3> <p>You can share the campaign, tell people about it.

<h3>The Album</h3> <p>Back in 2012 Boss Moxi set out to the hills of Maleny QLD to write and record demos for an album. 2 years later after performing the tracks live throughout our hometown of Brisbane, taking the tracks on tour  through New South Wales and Victoria we secured a producer and began recording at Bedlam Records in April of 2014. For 10 months we worked closely with producer, Steve Kempnich in turning our concepts in a full 14 track album.</p>

<div>Mastering, Printing &amp; Pressing - $2,000</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We need as much as we can get. Printing bulk CDs and Vinyls is not particularly easy and cheap. We need to master the tracks then print enough CDs to gift all you generous contributors, service and distribute the album to radio stations and press companies all over the globe. Owning and listening to the 14 track album on Vinyl is a dream of ours and when you hear the album will most probably be a dream shared by us and yourself. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Release &amp; Promotion - $3,000</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>For the most successful outcome we need to spend good money on promoting the album to reviewers, publications and music blogs all over the world. In this game of an industry we call music we need to play the right cards to ensure our creation is heard by as many people as possible, paying for separate press campaigns in Australia, U.K and the U.S. </div>

<div>Merchandise &amp; Final Tour - $2,000</div>

However, regardless of how much we manage to raise we're still going to release the album to our fans. As we've already paid for our album covers we'll sacrifice the global distribution and extensive press campaigns to make sure hard copies are distributed, Vinyls are printed and everything we've promised is given to contributors and further sold to our fans. At the end of the day we just want to hold this album in our hands, finished and printed, stick it in our non existent CD player and turn it the fuck up.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We need as much support on this as possible. Whether or not you contribute money to our campaign you can help by sharing it on social media, telling your hairy mates about it or hassling mum &amp; dad to put forward a donation to your favourite band. The more people talking about this the better and the more chance of us reaching our goal.

However, regardless of how much we manage to raise we're still going to release the album to our fans. As we've already paid for our album covers we'll sacrifice the global distribution and extensive press campaigns to make sure hard copies are distributed, Vinyls are printed and everything we've promised is given to contributors and further sold to our fans. At the end of the day we just want to hold this album in our hands, finished and printed, stick it in our non existent CD player and turn it the fuck up.   Other Ways You Can Help We need as much support on this as possible. Whether or not you contribute money to our campaign you can help by sharing it on social media, telling your hairy mates about it or hassling mum & dad to put forward a donation to your favourite band. The more people talking about this the better and the more chance of us reaching our goal. Any help will be awesomely appreciate a met with the inevitable release of Boss Moxi's 14 track debut album.

</p><p>My name is Angela Bernhardt and I live in the fabulous town of Morrison, Colorado. My husband and I moved to here a few years ago, we were blessed with the opportunity to take over a business, located in the heart of our downtown, and turn it to a thriving center-point of our community.</p><p> Last year, we formed the Morrison Event and Promotion Committee, a group geared towards helping bringing our community together while promoting our historical town, which predates the State of Colorado.  Morrison is rich in culture and history, and is home to one of the oldest masonry  structure in the State, Cliff House Lodge built by George Morrison, town founder, from 1864-1873. Morrison is also home to the discovery of the Stegosaurus and Apatosaurus, as well as the country’s most persevered Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Camp, and neighbor to the world famous Red Rocks Amphitheatre. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Last year we hosted our first annual Morrison Alley Fest, a free to the public event designed to bring businesses and residents closer together. Residents, business owners and law enforcement agencies volunteered their time to help organize and run the event. Our historical downtown area is restricted on space so we decided to utilized our alley ways, thus the name Alley Fest. Our local businesses opened their back doors and 30 vendors joined in the festivities. We had five local bands play on the main stage and three in secondary playing area near our carnival games. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This year’s Alley Fest will be bigger and better. The event will take place Saturday, May 2nd from 10am to 10pm.  We have expanded our festival grounds to encompass our community’s retirement center. Our kids carnival &amp; interactive play area, art walk and second music stage will fill the center’s lawn allowing our elderly resident the ability to participate in the activities.  The town’s businesses are getting more involved by hosting musical acts in their establishments, increase the exposure of local musically talented individuals. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Our event’s goal is to promote local musicians and artist in a family friendly, festival setting while increasing awareness of the importance of community. With the attendance tally over 2,500 last year and the abundance of positive feed back we received about on the event, we anticipate a substantial increase in numbers thus the need to expand our festival grounds. With the expansion of event parameters, there has been concern about our ability to pull off another seamless event, but with our dedication and passion towards our endeavors, we will be able to do just that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This year’s excitement about Alley Fest has increased the numbers of community members that have joined our efforts in making this event one of the most successful endeavors the town will ever witness. Over the past few months the community has come together to help construct carnival games, art installations, inactive gaming areas, and handmade carnival prizes. Our community has designated every Sunday as a craft day where the town actively participates in making these projects come to life. Through these weekly events our town is fortifying closer relationships with one another and setting an example for the younger generations about the importance of camaraderie.  </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hosting an event of this magnitude is no small undertaking and requires as much financial support as man power. With this being a free event built to support the community and local businesses we are asking for financial assistance from those with the means. Any contribution to this whether it be $1, $100 or $1000 makes a difference. Morrison Alley Fest would not be able to grow without the dedication of our residents and friends, support from volunteers, financial donations and sponsorship from neighboring community areas. </p><p>An event of this size costs around $25,000 and hundreds of man hours to produce.

<p>
</p><p>Whether we raise our goal amount or not this event will take place, there is no turning back for us now.

<p><b>Howdy
folks!</b></p>
<p>Welcome to the weird and wonderful world of The Don
Darlings. I am the Reverend (otherwise known as D.L. Collum) and I am the
singer. Although I have lived in Sweden for an unspecified amount of time, I
was born and raised in Texas. We originally formed in Gothenburg, Sweden in
2007 as a country-punk-folk band and boots have strayed down strange paths
since then. </p>
<p>We will soon finish the next step on our musical
journey and want you to join us! We would like to ask for your help to get this
music out to you and others like you who enjoy good music with heart and soul. We
don’t make music to get rich, we do it to make people feel something strong. Now,
a little introduction...</p>

<b>Who is/was Don Darling?</b>
<p>About ten years ago, I was driving through
the Texas Hill Country on my way from Austin out into the wild. By the side of
the highway, stood a large shed that had ""Snake Pit"" painted in large
letters. My curiosity could not be contained and I pulled into the driveway.
For a brief moment, I thought I had been transported to an alternate universe
based on ""From Dusk till Dawn"" when an angry dog approached the
car. </p>
<p>Then a man of at least 80 years came out
with his cane. He proudly showed me the ""Snake Pit"" and introduced
the names, as well as temperaments, of the five rattlers of various sizes. With
a gleaming light in his eye, he explained that he enjoyed educating passers-by
on the beauty of Texas wildlife. He then presented me with his card and said
any contributions would be kindly appreciated. If ever there was an interesting
character on this earth, it was certainly this stately old gentleman named Don
Darling.</p>
<p>I never thought I could sing but
couldn't help but sing along to every word of ""American Recordings""by Johnny Cash. One
day a few years after meeting Mr. Darling, some like-minded Scandinavian friends
of mine were kind enough to take me on a musical adventure where Gothic
Southern Americana meets Scandinavian Extraordinariness. </p>
<p><b>Where we were and where we are</b></p>
<p>After
playing extensively in Sweden and Europe, we have released three recordings
(Two LPs/CDs and one EP, all available on iTunes, Spotify and other sites). We no
longer consider ourselves a country-punk-folk band but those roots still
permeate our live shows. Reviews of our live shows and recordings have compared
us to a strange mixed drink of Nick Cave, Tom Waits, Johnny Cash and Leonard
Cohen with a bit of Mark Lanegan on the side. If you’re wonderin' what kind of head
we inhabit, that would describe it pretty well. </p>
<p>Now
we are ready to release a new limited edition colored vinyl single along with
planning a new European tour and want you to be part of
it!</p>
<p><b>How can you be part of it?</b></p>
<p>You
can make this happen by contributing to our project and get a copy of the

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Music Festivals have become extremely popular over the past
5 years. Due to the social media coverage a lot of older festivals have been
revived and newer ones have gained a following. Festivals like Coachella &amp;
SXSW have become among the most popular of their genre. We want to share the
festival experience with people who are not in the know. Especially the
festivals that do not get the press like the major festivals. In addition to
spreading the information, we will conduct interviews with artists, vendors,
and the festival-goers. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>This is a first of its kind but our mission is undoubtedly
achievable. We have found the bus that we want to purchase. It is priced at
$3,500 and renovations are totaling $5,000. The Yellow Cheese bus project is
not going to be a push over. We are putting all our time and effort into making
this a reality. Our support system is set in place and we are ready to pursue
our dream. It merely starts here but doesn't end here. </p>

<p><b>The Music</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There is a vivid theme of possibility and inspiration in the music.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>American modernist Georgia O’Keeffe sometimes painted her experience of the shapes, colors and emotions of the music that she heard. Ladder To The Moon features a premier performance of original compositions, arrangements and improvisations that  express shapes, colors and emotions inspired by the art of Georgia O’Keeffe.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>A Blend Of Styles</b></p>
<p>The music program is a blend of styles, infused with jazz. You may hear some things that sound classical while other parts may be Latin music, rock or folk music. The presentation will also feature individual and collective improvisation. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Augmented by Technology</b></p>
<p>We will use digital effects that enable us to include a variety of tones and timbres including: The sounds of vibraphone or marimba, grand piano, acoustic guitar or bass and jazz guitar and more.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Compositions &amp; Arrangements</b></p>
<p>The original compositions express the experience of being with Georgia O’Keefe’s art and being in the locations she depicted and where her art was created. </p>

Develop and deploy a live music and media program inspired by the art of Georgia O’Keeffe. 


Purpose
The purpose of the Ladder To The Moon project is to attract new communities and audiences to engage and enjoy art. We will do this by producing a unique entertainment experience program to:



Build expanded community for art galleries.
Develop a broader audience for jazz music.
Provide associated art appreciation education.




Scope
This project will:



Compose new music inspired by the art of Georgia O’Keeffe.
Arrange selected existing music inspired by the art of Georgia O’Keeffe.
Perform an initial concert of these compositions, arrangements at Colorado Springs FAC.
Create a media presentation integrated with the live music performance. 
Make the program available for presentation for museums and galleries.
Record and distribute an album of the music. (A future project, separately funded)

Objectives

Phase 1



Compose and/or arrange 12 music pieces for performance.
Select and contract musicians.
Create a media presentation.
Rehearse the performance.
Present the program at Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center July 9, 2015.

Phase 2 (A future project to be separately funded and launched at a later date.)







Record an album of the music from - Ladder To The Moon. 





The Music


There is a vivid theme of possibility and inspiration in the music.


American modernist Georgia O’Keeffe sometimes painted her experience of the shapes, colors and emotions of the music that she heard. Ladder To The Moon features a premier performance of original compositions, arrangements and improvisations that  express shapes, colors and emotions inspired by the art of Georgia O’Keeffe.


A Blend Of Styles
The music program is a blend of styles, infused with jazz. You may hear some things that sound classical while other parts may be Latin music, rock or folk music. The presentation will also feature individual and collective improvisation. 


Augmented by Technology
We will use digital effects that enable us to include a variety of tones and timbres including: The sounds of vibraphone or marimba, grand piano, acoustic guitar or bass and jazz guitar and more.


Compositions & Arrangements
The original compositions express the experience of being with Georgia O’Keefe’s art and being in the locations she depicted and where her art was created.

podemos decir orgullosamente, que a pesar de todo, nuestra vida entera la

<h3>UNA
GRAN OPORTUNIDAD</h3>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Hemos
sido invitados a interpretar nuestra música en Bonn. ¡Estas

boletos aéreos por
el momento están a $1,000 cada uno, también
necesitamos costear el transporte local durante nuestra estadía. Este
viaje representa un gran paso adelante en nuestra carrera musical. Por favor, ¡Ayúdanos a
volverlo realidad!</p>

En
Guatemala no hay mucho apoyo hacia el arte, por lo que el camino ha sido difícil y largo. Hoy
podemos decir orgullosamente, que a pesar de todo, nuestra vida entera la
dedicamos a la música. Tocamos en más de 5 proyectos cada uno,
escribimos y enseñamos música y sonido para vivir. 
UNA
GRAN OPORTUNIDAD
Hemos
sido invitados a interpretar nuestra música en Bonn. ¡Estas
son muy buenas noticias para nosotros! Desafortunadamente nuestros ingresos
como músicos,
hacen este viaje muy costoso para financiarlo solos.
Los
boletos aéreos por
el momento están a $1,000 cada uno, también
necesitamos costear el transporte local durante nuestra estadía. Este
viaje representa un gran paso adelante en nuestra carrera musical. Por favor, ¡Ayúdanos a
volverlo realidad!
¡AYÚDANOS A
CAMBIAR LA HISTORIA MUSICAL GUATEMALTECA!
Creemos
fuertemente, que el arte es lo que nuestro país
necesita para mejorar. Queremos mostrarle a nuestros compatriotas que se puede
vivir de lo que uno ama y ,más importante, de algo tan bello
como la música, lo
cual puede inspirarte a ser una mejor persona y por ende, construir una mejor
sociedad.
Este
viaje puede ayudarnos a inspirar a otras personas a perseguir sus sueños,
incluso cuando el camino es empinado. Estamos intentando hacer una afirmación grande
en nuestra sociedad.

ENGLISH VERSION
Hi! We are David Lemus and David Chinchilla. Both of us from Guatemala. 




We ask for your help to purchase our flight tickets from Guatemala City to Bonn Germany where we will perform at a series of shows during August 2015. 


There is not much support for arts here in Guatemala so the path's been rough. Today we can proudly say that, regardless of the circumstances, our whole life is completely dedicated to music. We play in over 5 different projects each, write, arrange and teach music and audio for a living.



A BIG OPPORTUNITY
We have been invited to play our music in Bonn. This is great news for us! Unfortunately our musician earnings make this trip very expensive for us to cost by ourselves.


 Flight tickets are right now $1000 each, we also need to pay for local transportation during our stay.  This trip represents a big step up in our musical careers! Please help us make this come true!!!



HELP US CHANGE GUATEMALAN MUSIC HISTORY!!

We strongly believe that art is what our country needs to improve. We want to show our fellow countrymen that you can actually make a decent living from something that you love and (most important) something as beautiful as music which can inspire you to become a better person and hence build a better society.  


This trip can help us inspire other people to go after their dreams, even when the road is steep. We are trying to make a bigger statement to our society!! 



YOU ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU GIVE


We have some really unique perks for you!! Please check on the available ones to decide which one is your favourite. We've managed to offer worldwide free shipping, please make sure to add your shipping address and email address where requested so that we can reach you. 


If you are not in a position that allows you to financially help us right now, please share this with your friends. This will always help us and we will really appreciate it!!

</div><div>Thank you everyone for joining the ""Peace of Mind for Sonia"" campaign. We'd like to introduce ourselves. We are Jorge Cuamacas and Laura Spada; currently living within the outskirts of Toronto, Canada. We decided to commence this campaign page in memory of our sister-in law; Sonia Mena, who tragically passed away on Saturday June 13, 2015.  She was only 38 years of age when she lost her battle to aggressive Brain Cancer; leaving behind her husband and two children.  She would have celebrated her 39th birthday on July 21. </div><div><br/></div><div>Sonia's troubles began on Saturday February 21, 2015. While doing laundry on the terrace of where she lived, she abruptly developed severe head pain - so intense that it caused her to collapse to the floor, having her landlord to thankfully find her in time. As they noticed that her skin colour was gradually changing and was flushed since her fall, they immediately rushed her to Emergency and was put under observation; while awaiting her CT Scan(s) as well as other tests to come back; in hopes to receive only some subtle news... However, this was not the case.</div><div><br/></div><div>Sonia was initially diagnosed with Encephalitis AutoImmune (inflammation of the brain). Eventually she had been released from the hospital and was prescribed specific medications to reduce the swelling of the brain, amongst other treatments of relief; including lots of rest - no movement, no bodily stress whatsoever.   </div><div><br/></div><div>As her weeks went on, her body began to suffer severe convulsions; seizures which caused her to lose feeling; initially, in her right arm and right leg. It was difficult for her to smile and to speak. Her convulsions were causing her muscles to contort.</div><div><br/></div><div>Progressively, her health was worsening; having all her limbs grow numb. Her family decided to visit other doctors, including neurologists. These several doctors that she had visited had then prescribed  her additional medication, while at the same time: they too had found it difficult to fully determine what was going on with Sonia and her condition. </div><div><br/></div><div>After weeks of consuming up to seven types of drugs per day; the family became desperate as they saw her health going downhill. She was eating very little; only a few spoons of soup within 3 days, and had also carried symptoms of nausea and difficulty breathing.

He had checked her out, and realized that she was intoxicated from all the mediation she had been taking. He urged her to stop taking the drugs. But the worst was yet to come ... The Naturopath assured Sonia was suffering from severe brain cancer, and decided to delicately disclose the news to her loved ones, without letting her know. He expressed deep sympathy; unsure as to how much longer she had to live... </div><div><br/></div><div>She retuned to Ibarra where she passed the last couple of days of her life in her home; lying in bed - right by her loved ones. Her head pains were getting worse. By this time, she developed full speech impediment. The family finally decided to bring her back to the hospital in Ibarra; where they then transferred her to the main facility in Quito; Ecuador's capital city. She remained in hospital for only a day or two; where during that time she was transferred to ICU (intensive care unit). Eventually her brain lost all strength, and collapsed. She became brain-dead. Her doctor immediately put her on life support; but only for a short period of time.  The doctor had gathered the family, and wistfully recommended to <i>'let her go'</i> so that at least she will no longer be suffering and could rest in peace.  The chance to surviving through life support was very small, and even if she were to survive - it would feel unfair and almost ""egotistical"" to see her lying there in a bed like a vegetable, only for the sake of still seeing her present; rather than <i>alive</i>. The family; as much as it pained them to decide this, had let her go, and about an hour after removing the life support; she <i>let go</i> at 3:00 in the afternoon. </div><div><br/></div><div>Since Saturday afternoon, days have turned dark and gloomy for the Cuamacas family.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3>Ever since I asked for a guitar at age 3, music has been a passion of mine.  For a good portion of the last decade this passion has been embodied by AM Exchange. There here have been different phases and iterations, highs and lows, but at the end of the day, it has always been a vehicle for my personal expression, a way of trying to make sense of the world and a means of trying to share my insights and emotions with music fans. <br/><br/>So far, 2015 has been an amazing year!  I've had the opportunity to work with some incredibly talented people, released <a href=""http://amexchange.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">two singles</a> and a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pZAjW0Pwkw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">music video</a>, and received some good <a href=""http://www.baeblemusic.com/musicblog/4-28-2015/am-exchange-finds-the-new-in-alt-pop-history.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">press</a> along the way.   <br/><br/>I am grateful for everything that's happened so far, but it didn't happen on its own.  I have financed the recording sessions, video production and promotion of AM Exchange's new EP with personal money and credit cards.  To take it to the next level I am turning to friends, family and fans for support to help finance the upfront costs of record and merchandise production that will be an essential revenue stream while on the road .  As many of you may know, I'm terrible at asking for help, but I've put my pride away, I'm here,  I'm asking. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>AM Exchange will have the opportunity to go on a 22-date national tour 
as a 3-piece this summer to promote the new <b>Intentions EP</b>.  (The EP is recorded and mixed and is currently being mastered...it's almost done). From Los Angeles to Atlanta, Charlotte to New York, Cleveland to 
Seattle, Portland to San Francisco and a whole lot in between, it is 
incredibly exciting and inspiring.  So much hotel furniture just waiting to be glued to the ceiling ;)<br/></p>While touring is essential for independent artists today, there are also a lot of expensive upfront costs. We'll be playing small clubs and they'll pay us, but with the 
cost of gas and travel, it's nothing to write home about.  One of the 
best ways for independent artists to stay afloat  on the road is to sell 
merchandise...and that's where you come in.<br/><br/>I'm asking for $5000 to cover the upfront cost of merchandise production. In exchange, you'll be able to pick from a variety of perks, have  access to exclusive content and receive  undying love. <br/><br/>Here are the production estimates:<br/>Vinyl                        $2250<br/>T-Shirts                  $1000<br/>CDs                          $1000<br/>Posters                   $300<br/>Key chains             $200<br/>Koozies                   $150<br/>Stickers                  $100<br/><b>TOTAL                 $5000<br/></b><br/>If this campaign is fortunate enough to go over its fundraising goal, the additional money will go towards the van rental, gas and lodging.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>AM Exchange is currently engaged in a national press and radio campaign and by playing shows in many of these same targeted markets,  we have the ability to reach a lot more potential fans and gain substantial national (and potentially international) exposure. <br/><br/>Music is something I'm deeply
 passionate about and I believe it's important.  Being a musician may not be as important as being a teacher, a nurse or a firefighter, but I do think what we do has a positive impact.  While our contributions may be intangible at times, I feel they can still have an important influence. <br/><br/>There can be an underlying arrogance when a musical artists asks you to listen,  to buy, to contribute. However, most of the time, we just want to be able to do what we do and  excel at it. Writing, recording 
and performing  music is one of the few things that I'm halfway decent at. At the end of the day, I just want to do a good job. <br/><br/><p> 

At the beginning of 2015, I developed and set out on a specific  18-month strategy  and I have 
worked at it relentlessly, literally every single day of this year.  (Ok, except for New Years Day... I was hungover New Years Day, give me a break.)   The PR and radio campaigns kicked off in April  and already, in 2 months, there has been significant media and radio traction.   With this EP release and tour, I'm excited to see where we can take this.</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This tour will be anything but glamorous.  It will be three sweaty musicians slumming it across the country in a van, sleeping on floors and staying in hostels.  It will be raw, it will be real, it will be very rock'n'roll... but, don't get me wrong, it will be fucking awesome.  That being said, there's always the risk that it won't have as big of an impact as planned. But I promise you this, we're going to play our asses off at every show, in every city. <br/></p>
<p>The music business is one of the most competitive, ruthless and fickle industries around, but I'm not going to let that stop me from giving it a proper shot. I'm not going to let the fear of failure stop me from making sure  I give it everything I have.  Music will always be a part of my life, but with recent developments, I'm at a point where (with the proper strategy, tenacity and support) I can maybe, just maybe, potentially do this for a living. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't spare 
anything, I understand, trust me, I know what it's like.  However, you can still help by sharing this campaign on social media,  email or by word of mouth with people that might be interested in 
contributing. <br/></p>
<p>You know, that rich uncle that always invites himself to Thanksgiving or the investment banker that talks on his Bluetooth in the grocery store, that's right, the one that takes up two parking spots with his Porsche. Do me a favor,  try to convince them to give me some of their money :)<br/></p>
<p>The Indiegogo share tools make it quick and simple. Every little bit helps and every action is greatly appreciated! Thank you for taking the time to check out this campaign. Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions, comments and/or concerns.  <br/></p>Wishing you all the best! <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Daniel Jacobs <br/>AM Exchange<br/><a href=""http://www.amexchangemusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.amexchangemusic.com</a><br/>amexchangeproductions@gmail.com<br/>

<p>The intention behind The Kali Collective is to provide yoga to all groups of people and promote so much more than just the physical practice. Steph and Jenny stand behind the values that yoga has to offer such as self love, self inquiry, truth, integrity, balance and commitment. One of the most important aspects of yoga the The Kali Collective will support is Community. We are dedicated to creating a space for all yogi’s to come together regardless of age, social group, income or physical ability. Community will be encouraged by offering donation classes, creating partnerships with local businesses and charities and allowing access to yoga for people with mental and physical disabilities.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hi! We are a band from Costa Rica called RAIN (yes, some Spanglish taste). We have many influences, but we try to center our genre as some kind of rock/folk/indie/worship/alternative (you'll like it). We have played together for almost 4 years now, and we have enjoyed this journey like never before.</p>
<p>You know, every band dreams with recording an album and with crowds singing their songs. We are working hard for this to happen for us, but we try to go further. We are messengers, our music shares hope, love, second opportunities.</p>
<p>We have already recorded 8 songs (from our own wallets), but we still need to mix, master, and distribute the album. Our campaign's objective is to raise $2500 for this purpose. You can be part of this dream!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Every cent we raise will be directly used in the post-production of the songs. Each one of them need to be mixed (for all instruments to sound complementary with each other), masterized (audio processing), and distributed (like a nice album art and the printing of the discs). <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We already recorded, mixed, and mastered our first single called ""Te encontraré"".</span>
</div>
<div>If you back us with $5, you will receive a link to download the single. If you back us with $10 or more, you will receive a link to download the single and a link to download the entire album once it is available. Every dollar counts!</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>We are normal people with fears and troubles, but with stronger will and confidence. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We have a mission.

We want to encourage and show every person we meet that dreams can still come true. </span>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>A starting musician struggles with money, you know. Up to date, we have worked hard to get our own instruments, transportation to concerts, and start up the album recording.

<p>You know what a pegasus is, right?  This is like that, but it's a zebra.</p>
<p>As I say in the video, I am a classically trained composer looking to break into the world of electronic music.  I've done a lot of work on my PC, but I do not have access to the hardware and software I need in order to produce professional-level sound.  I have the skills and the experience - I just need a little bit of money.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>-The equipment I'm looking at is going to cost me about $3000.  This will include a computer that wasn't built in 2008 (i.e. the one I'm typing this on right now), a controller, a microphone, and studio software. </p>
<p>-I promised $300 to my artist.  She has already created one great piece for me and is working on a second.  She said she was happy to do it for free but I have to pay her because she's so talented.</p>
<p>-The rest of that money goes to fulfilling perks and paying various fees (credit card transfer fees, PayPal fees, Indiegogo fees, and so on).</p>
<p>-What can I do if I exceed my goal?  Buy better equipment.  Take time off of work to work even harder on the album.  Basically, more money means a better album.</p>
<p>-What can I do if I do not meet my goal?  Well, after I fulfill perks and my fees, I will spend what's left on whatever equipment I can and work tirelessly toward releasing the best album I can that budget.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Well, I deliver pizzas for a living.  It's not fun, it's dangerous, and people are often quite mean for no good reason.  It's not the worst job in the world, but I want to do more with my life.  I'd rather stop stressing out over bad tips and start stressing out over album sales.  The success of this project can also help me launch myself into the upper echelon of the music scene.  This fundraising goal is not about one album, it's about my entire music career.  I want to write a wide variety of music in hopes of being featured in video games, apps, movies, and more.  This album is the first step to make so much more happen.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>My biggest risk is that the album will not do well and it will crush me.  But if that happens, I still have all the equipment and can try again.  I will always try again.</p>
<p>My biggest challenge is simply finding the time to make the music.  Between work and school, I suppose I'll have a few nights where I don't sleep too much.  But if it's for my artistic vision, I will find a way to get by like I have in the past.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Spread the word.  PLEASE, spread the word.  Copy and paste this URL and send it so someone you think will be interested.  It'll take 10 seconds and mean a whole lot to me and my future.  Follow me on Twitter.  Subscribe to me on YouTube.  Pet your dog for me.  Give your cat a kiss on the nose.  Tickle your babies' toes.  Tell them all you did it for Zebregasus.</p>

<p>Port Arthur needs your help! We want to go on tour this August and we can't do it without you.</p>
<p>Earlier this year we released our first full-length album, ""Everything's Incredible,"" to much acclaim. We want to take it on the road and share it with like-minded audiences in cities such as Richmond, Asheville, Chicago, and New York! You can listen to it at <a rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">portarthur.bandcamp.com</a>.</p>
<p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>Port Arthur is a seven-piece folk-rock band from Philadelphia, PA. Fronted by singer-songwriter Luke Shefski, Port Arthur combines the best musicians from Temple University's Boyer School of Music with the DIY attitude of Philly's indie scene. Our sound is a genre-bending mix of folk, jazz, rock 'n' roll and old-time razzle-dazzle.</p>

<p><b>What do we need?</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, touring is complicated for even a small band. We will be going full-band for this trip, which means we'll be shipping out with seven sweaty people and all of our musical equipment in an old van. Needless to say, logistics will be complicated, and any little bit of funding will go a long way. $2500 is a modest amount for a tour of this scale, and will cover transportation costs, food, tour-related merch, as well as an emergency fund.</p>
<p><b>Why do we need it?</b></p>
</div><div> <p>More than just helping a bunch of music students travel the country, you will be helping us play a small part in bringing the musical communities of this huge country a little closer together. Each city has its own music, its own style, its own scene, and the connections made on tour by independent musicians are invaluable to our community. We want to make sure we're prepared and able to deliver a powerful, inspiring performance every night we're on tour.<br/><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FWr9ZumH7Xyc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWr9ZumH7Xyc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FWr9ZumH7Xyc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">(Video by Ian Watson)</span><p></p>

<p>Beyond this, we will be making a digital recording of each gig and compiling the best of the best material to create a full-length live album. We will also, of course, be taking pictures along the way and we plan to make a photobooklet of our favorite memories from the tour. Both of these will be available exclusively to campaign contributors. We are also willing to play for you! See the Perks for more details.</p>
<p>There is no upper limit on the amount of money we can raise on this campaign so, should we receive more than $2500, it will go towards more really cool stuff for you - maybe even a new album!</p>

</div></div>","What are we doing?
Port Arthur needs your help! We want to go on tour this August and we can't do it without you.
Earlier this year we released our first full-length album, ""Everything's Incredible,"" to much acclaim. We want to take it on the road and share it with like-minded audiences in cities such as Richmond, Asheville, Chicago, and New York! You can listen to it at portarthur.bandcamp.com.
Who are we?
Port Arthur is a seven-piece folk-rock band from Philadelphia, PA. Fronted by singer-songwriter Luke Shefski, Port Arthur combines the best musicians from Temple University's Boyer School of Music with the DIY attitude of Philly's indie scene. Our sound is a genre-bending mix of folk, jazz, rock 'n' roll and old-time razzle-dazzle.

What do we need?
Unfortunately, touring is complicated for even a small band. We will be going full-band for this trip, which means we'll be shipping out with seven sweaty people and all of our musical equipment in an old van. Needless to say, logistics will be complicated, and any little bit of funding will go a long way. $2500 is a modest amount for a tour of this scale, and will cover transportation costs, food, tour-related merch, as well as an emergency fund.
Why do we need it?
 More than just helping a bunch of music students travel the country, you will be helping us play a small part in bringing the musical communities of this huge country a little closer together. Each city has its own music, its own style, its own scene, and the connections made on tour by independent musicians are invaluable to our community. We want to make sure we're prepared and able to deliver a powerful, inspiring performance every night we're on tour.(Video by Ian Watson)

</h3><p><b>Story and Background</b></p>
<p>Thank
you so much for checking out my Campaign! Hopefully you were able to watch my
video and get a general idea of this project! The story below will give a
little more detail and info so please be sure to take a read!</p>
<p>My name is Ben and I’m a
songwriter continuing on a path I started when I was young. This campaign is a way
for you to be apart of something I love and am very excited about.  I am beyond grateful for your contributions and
consideration for the project! </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">There is nothing in my life I
am more passionate about than the art of music. More than anything I want to
express my heart and mind through these songs and share it with anyone who is
willing to listen.  As stated in the
video, I spent night after night writing this album in my bedroom for several
months. I would go to work, come home, and sit on my floor for the majority of
the night writing until my neighbor below would bang on the ceiling with her
broom. The inspiration for the songs came from all sorts of different places.
Stories, dreams, emotions, it’s all in there. Over the past few years I’ve
learned to strongly believe that pursuing something you love, regardless of the
sacrifice, is far more important than having the ability but not making the effort
due to fear of failure or unsatisfactory. It took a lot for me to tell the lies
in my head to shut up so I could pursue this, and often times it’s still a
battle, but our minds contain to much creativity to go to waste and this
project is me sharing with you what its in my heart and mind. Once again thank
you for your love and support for this project and my music.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>Why 7,000?</b></p>
<p>I was trying to come up with
a safe amount that wasn’t too low, but also wasn’t unreachable. Within this
amount ill be able to acquire all the needs for the record including studio
time, mixing, mastering, artwork, and the printing/packaging. </p>
<p><b>What If you don’t
meet your goal?</b></p>
<p>Since the campaign is done
through Indiegogo, which allows for any funds raised to be kept, ill know how
much is needed to continue with the project and begin planning what my next
steps will be. </p>
<p><b>Why a full album
instead of an EP?</b></p>
<p>There could still be an EP,
but right now I’m trying to think big picture and strive for something on a
larger scale. I have the music for a full album, which is motivating me to do
that instead of the EP, but I also want people to have the option of more songs
to listen to if they enjoy the music. </p>
<p><b>Can we trust you
with our money?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Something will become of
it, whether that’s the full record, an EP, or just a single (all dependent on
the amount of funds raised).  Too much
work has gone into the project for it to be for anything else. </p>
<p><b>I want to donate
but I just can’t right now, what can I do?</b></p>
<p>Social media is a very large
part of promoting these days so making some noise about it would be very
beneficial, especially if you’re sharing it to people who can donate! You can
also direct people to certain pages for future news and updates about the
project, music, shows, etc. like my Instagram page (@benpeverall) , Facebook

</h3>In Spring of 2015, Joy Shannon and the Beauty Marks released an album called ""Mo Anam Cara"" which follows the ancient Celtic calendar, with a song for every seasonal holiday. Now, with the filmmaking and design team who brought you the Beauty Marks' music video ""Midsummer Witchhunt"", we are creating a 4 song music video, spanning the entire seasonal arc of the album ""Mo Anam Cara"". In essence, we will be creating a short film, which illustrates the 4 major season and Celtic pagan holidays, with the songs ""Imbolc: Invocation to Brighid"", ""The Fires of Beltaine"", ""Mabon: Airmid Bring Back the Dead"" and ""Midwinter Ghost"". <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We are fundraising for $1200 to pay for camera rental and a cinematographer's time to shoot these 4 videos over the course of about a week. Additional expenses include costuming for our performers, paying our fabulous makeup and hair designer Monique Paredes her very reasonable day rate, and food for the cast and crew during our shooting days. <br/><br/>What you will get in return for your generous support are various perks including special edition T-shirts, posters, music releases and, ultimately, a DVD of the Joy Shannon and the Beauty Marks music video collection. Plus, there will be a live film viewing and music performance by the band in the LA area when the videos are complete. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>This is the biggest music video project we have tackled yet! While we have done many single song music videos for many of our albums, the Beauty Marks have never done a 4-song music video! Though, because Joy has made short films in her past, as well as director Matt Kollar has created feature films and TV-series, the duo felt inspired to push past the scope of their previous music video projects. <br/><br/>This album ""Mo Anam Cara"" is such a special album, which details the entire year cycle of the ancient Celtic calendar, so it felt fitting to honor this album with more than a single music video, but rather 4 videos which blend together, mirroring the cycle of the year itself. Successfully executing this concept will make this a very impactful short film/music video piece. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Truly the biggest hurdle is the scope of this project, being 4 music videos in one. Yet, Matt Kollar and Joy Shannon, along with their creative team, have experience working together on smaller, complicated film projects already, so it feels like nothing they can't handle! <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you can't contribute financially, come help out on set! We can always use an extra set of hands during our filming, which is set to be in December 2015 and January 2016. Send us a message if you're interested!<br/>

<p>I have been described by Clyde Stubblefield as The Princess of Soul and i plan on keeping this title ! I come from a small town in Quebec just outside of Ottawa. I started singing at age 12 and immediately knew my calling. I am fortunate enough to have friends and family around me who are supporting and nurturing of my passion. I believe that music is something to be cherished and shared with the world. My plan is to release my 2nd album This January starting with a single. I have worked really hard at this point and i was fortunate enough to work with some incredibly talented musicians. Now that the new album is ready to be released we are looking for funding to market the project.  I will be hiring Publicists and having to fund world wide marketing agencies. We are reaching out to industry professionals on both coasts, in New York City and Los Angles. This funding will allow us to hire the best in the business. I want people to know even though i have worked very hard making the album this is the most crucial step in having a successful release. My plan is to reach $10,000. Even if you haven't any financial support for the project I would appreciate your support by sharing, following or liking any of my social media pages. My plan is to give Cd's, various merchandise, song downloads &amp; Live Performances for contributions. I have always believed being a singer has been  part of a bigger picture. I would like to thank everyone who is contributing to this project. When we reach our goal these publicists will make it possible for me to play my music in the states with the original musicians off the album. Some of these musicians are Clyde Stubblefield (James Brown's Drummer), Mae Koen (Aretha Franklin back up singer) Shay Jones ( Chaka Kahn &amp; Nine inch nails back up singer), Grammy award nominated Billy Branch harmonica, Champagne James Robertson Guitarist (well known for playing with Lindi Ortega). We have overcome most of the hurdles having produced the album. Luckily i had Neal Sundet &amp; Jack Letourneau as my producers who have been standing by me all the way. Now our last hurdle is to successfully promote the album. Thanks for reading about my funding campaign even if you cant contribute please share this with your friends family's and co workers !</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting this page!  I am so thankful for your support and love.  </p>
<h3>The Basics:</h3>
<ul> <li>Beginning in January 2016, I'll be traveling to communities around the country to play house concerts of my original music.  I hope to sing with, gather stories from, and share life with the people I meet in my travels.  I want to offer my music, to offer myself to serve in the communities I visit, and to offer my ears to listen to the stories of those I meet.</li>
<li>I will also participate in some formal projects:  a peacemaking delegation with Christian Peacemaker Teams, a songwriting retreat through the Glen Workshop, and several other conferences and gatherings throughout the year. </li> <li>This journey is my own project, and I hope to be filled by it.  I hope for times of contemplation and renewing, as this season is something of a sabbatical for me.  I also hope to offer friendship, service, and my music to those I visit.  </li>
<li>I am so excited about this opportunity!  I need your support to make this idea into a reality.  Please read the details and money sections below to learn how you can help.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Details:</h3> <ul>
<li>I am going to be traveling by bus, train, and plane.  I plan to take at least 7 months visiting communities and friends across the Southeast, East Coast, and Southwest.  (I'd also love to make it out to the West Coast, probably in the second half of the year.)  I hope to visit around 40 communities in 2016.  </li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I'll be traveling and offering my music for the bulk of this journey.  My favorite way to share music is in living rooms, and I am so excited to put together a tour of house concerts.  There is something mystical about getting folks to sing together in the space of a home.  In exchange for the hospitality my friends will show me, I can offer a concert and my willingness to work.  I want to sing my songs with you, I want to hear your stories, I want to meet your elders, I want to see your projects, and I want to learn from your experiences.</span></li>
<li>One of my earliest stops is to participate in the <span style=""background-color: initial;""><a href=""http://www.cpt.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Christian Peacemaker Teams</a>' Borderlands Delegation (based in Tucson, AZ).  I will have the opportunity to see firsthand some of the tension and fallout of the system which our country uses to regulate its southern borders.  I will hear stories from migrants, local residents, activists, and law enforcement personnel.  I have never participated in a peacemaking delegation like this, so I am excited to spend 10 days living and learning with peacemakers and locals.  </span>
</li>
<li>One of the last stops I have planned is a writing workshop in Santa Fe, NM.  <a href=""http://www.imagejournal.org/glenworkshop/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Glen Workshop</a> is put on by the Image Journal, a literary journal that focuses on Christian mysticism and the arts.  Two of my musical heroes, Karin Bergquist and Linford Detweiler (better known as Over the Rhine), are the teachers for the week-long songwriting seminar at this workshop.  I am absolutely thrilled (...almost giddy...) to be participating in this workshop in August.  After 7 months of travel, I'm sure I will be ready for a retreat and some tools to synthesize my experiences and tour stories.  </li>
</ul>
<div><h3>The Money:</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>Will you donate to help offset my trip costs, estimated at $6000 - $8000 for the entire year?</li>
<li>I have already invested about $1000 in pre-trip expenses.  Much of that cost covered recording and producing my forthcoming album 'becoming home'. </li>
<li>50% of my projected expenses are travel-related: bus, plane, and train tickets, and gas money for kind souls who drive me from place to place.</li>
<li>The other big expenses are for experiences <span style=""background-color: initial;"">- $800 for participation in the Christian Peacemaker Teams delegation, approx. $1000 for participation in the Glen Workshop, and $700 for conference fees, entry fees for state and national parks, and the occasional ticket to attend a concert.</span>
</li>
<li>The rest of the money I'll use for food, and to repay my hosts for their hospitality.</li>
<li> I also need to buy a backpack to carry my load.</li>
<li>You'll notice I'm only asking for $5,000, but I've listed more expenses than that in this description.  I'm setting out on faith that provision will come.  I have saved up a little money to get me started on this project, and I will be investing all of it into this tour.  I'll be setting out a tip jar at some of my shows on the road, and I am also hoping that people will choose to purchase my album 'becoming home' when it is released online.</li> <li>If I don't raise the full amount listed here, don't worry!  I will travel and tour for as long as I can until the money (or my fortitude) runs out.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why am I doing this?</h3> <ul> <li>My goal is to gather and share stories, to build connections between spiritual communities in many places, and to sing with friends wherever I go.</li> <li>In 2014, I took a month-long tour of communities and had a wonderful experience sharing music and traveling.  This upcoming tour will put into play the wisdom I gained on my first tour.</li> <li>I aim to be deeply present wherever I travel.  I love playing house shows and un-amplified music because it draws people toward each other, toward a quiet thing, in a space of welcome.  I want to be a person of welcome wherever I go, and I look forward to being welcomed by the communities I visit.</li>

<h3>------ UPDATE -----</h3>
<p>I have had some people ask why I asked for $40,000 for my Indiegogo. That's a lot of money right? Sure it is.</p>
<p>The reality is that this is not even a the full cost of what it will actually cost me to record, release, promote, and print merchandise for this project. The recording cost of Razorwire was $10,000. For this record I asked $25,000 so that I could take more than 5 days this time to record and pay my team members what they rightfully deserve. All of the other cost were the same as this budget and were self funded. Shocking? It is to me too.</p>
<p>The campaign ends in 30 days and I hope at this point I can make it to $10,000 for the Indiegogo Campaign so that at the minimum I can record a great record. It will force everyone to make sacrifices and will require me to trust and pray that labels will step in and release this record so that I can get the record out to the world without self funding the entire cost, but I will give you a great record none the less.</p>
<p>So let break it down. What does it take to release a record internationally as an independent artist in all of Europe and the United States?</p>
<p>Recording Cost - $25,000 (actual quotes I have received)<br/>Album Art - $500<br/>Photos (hair, makeup, location, and clothes) - $500<br/>CD printing and pressing - $1,500<br/>Tee-shirts (including design) - $800 <br/>Vinyl - $800<br/>Posters - $200<br/>Publicity Worldwide (including the printing of 1,000 promotional CDs and shipping for these CDs) - $10,000<br/>Radio Publicity Worldwide - $3,000<br/>Release Tour Upfront cost - $3,000<br/>Music video - $5,000</p>
<p>TOTAL = $50,300</p>
<p>Thank you for your support and thank you so much to all of you out there that have donated and participated. You are as big a part of this record as I am.</p>
<h3>STORY</h3>Two years after the release of my first full length album, <i>Razor Wire</i>, I have finally finished writing for my second record. I have played hundreds of shows all over the world the past couple years and I have met so many loving a gracious people along the way. Many of the new songs are about those experiences.
<p>In 2014, when <i>Razor Wire </i>came out, I was an independent artist. Now in 2016 and I am still independent and this is why I am doing a pledge campaign : to keep the music alive and making this record. I am grateful that nowadays, there are options for us musicians  to humbly ask for help and offer you perks while doing so.</p>
<p>This is where you get to be a part of this project! Without a label, I rely on you for support in order to provide the capital to record and print this new full length record. And for it to happen, I will ask for you to share this project. Broadcast it to the world so we can get meet the goal. Your help is more important than you can imagine in the process of making this record. In fact you are critical. </p>
<p>In return you get to brag for receiving the record before anyone else and perhaps having your name on the credits or even on all my tour swag! So thank you for everything, even sharing this link will be tremendously helpful.</p>I love you all. Let's do this! </div> <div> <h3></h3>

For this record I asked $25,000 so that I could take more than 5 days this time to record and pay my team members what they rightfully deserve. All of the other cost were the same as this budget and were self funded. Shocking? It is to me too.
The campaign ends in 30 days and I hope at this point I can make it to $10,000 for the Indiegogo Campaign so that at the minimum I can record a great record. It will force everyone to make sacrifices and will require me to trust and pray that labels will step in and release this record so that I can get the record out to the world without self funding the entire cost, but I will give you a great record none the less.
So let break it down. What does it take to release a record internationally as an independent artist in all of Europe and the United States?
Recording Cost - $25,000 (actual quotes I have received)Album Art - $500Photos (hair, makeup, location, and clothes) - $500CD printing and pressing - $1,500Tee-shirts (including design) - $800 Vinyl - $800Posters - $200Publicity Worldwide (including the printing of 1,000 promotional CDs and shipping for these CDs) - $10,000Radio Publicity Worldwide - $3,000Release Tour Upfront cost - $3,000Music video - $5,000
TOTAL = $50,300
Thank you for your support and thank you so much to all of you out there that have donated and participated. You are as big a part of this record as I am.
STORYTwo years after the release of my first full length album, Razor Wire, I have finally finished writing for my second record. I have played hundreds of shows all over the world the past couple years and I have met so many loving a gracious people along the way. Many of the new songs are about those experiences.
In 2014, when Razor Wire came out, I was an independent artist. Now in 2016 and I am still independent and this is why I am doing a pledge campaign : to keep the music alive and making this record. I am grateful that nowadays, there are options for us musicians  to humbly ask for help and offer you perks while doing so.
This is where you get to be a part of this project! Without a label, I rely on you for support in order to provide the capital to record and print this new full length record. And for it to happen, I will ask for you to share this project. Broadcast it to the world so we can get meet the goal. Your help is more important than you can imagine in the process of making this record. In fact you are critical. 
In return you get to brag for receiving the record before anyone else and perhaps having your name on the credits or even on all my tour swag! So thank you for everything, even sharing this link will be tremendously helpful.I love you all. Let's do this!

Of The Hate LP</b></p>
<p>It has been fifteen years since the
original ""Defenders of the Hate"" 7"" was released, nine years
since the comp CD, and five years since the passing of my good friend Seth
Putnam.  The original plan was to develop
a compilation LP celebrating his life to be released this year.  But, in order to accomplish what I want from
it, it is going to a lot more time and effort than I had planned.  So to kick off what I hope to be a series of
Seth Putnam related releases, we decided to reissue this classic album on
full-length vinyl with the express permission of Seth’s estate.</p>
<p><b>Become
a Defender</b></p>
<p>The ""Defenders of the
Hate"" LP will feature all the songs that were on the compact disc version.
500 copies on standard black will be released for retail. 200 copies will be on pink vinyl available to
those choosing to contribute with that perk, and customers who purchase a copy
through the MTS webstore.</p>
<p>In addition to the color vinyl,
perks will be offered for ""Defenders of the Hate"" t-shirts and
patches.  And as a special contribution
package, MTS is offering a limited copy of the album on red vinyl.  This version will only be limited to those who
participate.  If only 9 people
contribute, it will be limited to 9 copies.  Each of these red vinyl copies will be
hand-numbered and personalized to the contributors.  Any remaining copies not claimed will be
destroyed in a drunken rampage. </p>
<p>The release is ready to go.  Mastering and artwork is done, we are now
arranging the funding for manufacturing the vinyl, shirts, and patches.  Our goal is roughly $5,000 to cover all costs.
Future profits will be used for band
compensations and future AxCx  and Seth Putnam related releases. </p>

500 copies on standard black will be released for retail. 200 copies will be on pink vinyl available to
those choosing to contribute with that perk, and customers who purchase a copy
through the MTS webstore.
In addition to the color vinyl,
perks will be offered for ""Defenders of the Hate"" t-shirts and
patches.  And as a special contribution
package, MTS is offering a limited copy of the album on red vinyl.  This version will only be limited to those who
participate. If only 9 people
contribute, it will be limited to 9 copies.  Each of these red vinyl copies will be
hand-numbered and personalized to the contributors.  Any remaining copies not claimed will be
destroyed in a drunken rampage. 
The release is ready to go.  Mastering and artwork is done, we are now
arranging the funding for manufacturing the vinyl, shirts, and patches.  Our goal is roughly $5,000 to cover all costs. 
Future profits will be used for band
compensations and future AxCx  and Seth Putnam related releases. 
The
risks?
If you do not contribute now, you
might miss out, and you'll be sorry.

<p>It's been over a year and a half
since we were last in the studio, and we are now ready to record our third
album.  The album is already written, we have engineers lined up ready to
record, mix and master, except we are doing one thing differently this time: We
are doing this entirely independently without a record label.<br/>
This will be game-changing for us, and you the fans, as we will now own our own

<p><b>What
we need from you</b></p>
<p>Without a label, many bands can't
afford to front recording or touring or even exist. Initially we weren't sure
if we wanted to switch labels and repeat the same process we've done, but after
reviewing the numbers and possibilites, realized that this is not an insane
amount of money to ask for, and that the end result will be a record done
exactly how WE want it with no external influence pushing us in any direction,
and a record that WE OWN, so we can actually make money doing something we
love, and put it straight back into our live show.<br/>

We are also offering a bunch of unique items, including Parker's very own

<p>We know from our travels all over the world that our fans are
incredible and want this new music as much as we do, and we are confident that
we can hit our goal and put out the most crushingly melodic, musical album of
our careers thus far. <br/>
Rest assured that any money raised past our goal will go directly toward the
betterment of the band, keeping us on the road, or covering the massive upfront
costs that have been keeping us from Europe these past two years.<br/>

de la musicienne en réaction avec son instrument et l’interaction de son
cerveau face à la musique. Les données récupérées par ces capteurs
influencent les jeux de lumières et de projections sur la scène.  Ainsi, basée sur
une performance autant physique que musicale, chaque spectacle sera unique.Les premières représentations du spectacle auront lieu les 26, 27 et 28 mai 2016 à la Cinquième Salle de la Place des Arts de Montréal. Le concert sera ensuite offert en tournée partout dans le monde.Deux constructions

ORBIS CONCERT CONCEPT
Orbis showcases harpist Valérie Milot in solo, but virtually accompanied by more than twenty musicians. New technologies allow to capture invisible elements: sound spectrum, muscular body work of the musician in reaction with her instrument and the interaction of the brain with the music. The data collected by these sensors influence the lightings and projections on the stage. Thus, based on both physical and musical performances, each show will be unique.
The first reprensatations of Orbis will take place at the Cinquième Salle of La Place des Arts in Montreal, May 26, 27 and 28, 2016.
Two major constructions are part of the show:Radiant disk

This circular platform on which Valérie plays has a complete system of lightings on it's inner and outer faces.
Dome

A domed structure is placed on the lighting disk at the end of the show. It's semi-transparent fabric allows to project images and videos on it, while Valerie performs in it. 


Orbis is made of three distinctive chapters:
Chapter 1
Memory projection: Valerie shines

In the beginning the show, Valerie dazzled through the disk of light around her, like a lighthouse through the night. Struck by the radiant disk, shapes placed around it create defined shadows.
Chapter 2
Physical projection: Valérie reveals herself

This segment emphasizes the muscular work of the artist in a more intimate environment, through the disc's inner lights.
Chapter 3
Soul projection: Valérie reveals her secrets
A dome is placed on the radiant disk. At that time, the audience will see images of Valérie's emotions when she performs. With that in mind, the videos projected on the surface of the dome will be influenced by sensors.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>
<p>My friends, I'm looking for your help to finalize the mixing and mastering of ""OPEN YOUR EYES"", which is a song I co-wrote posthumously with the late Benjamin Orr. It was from a late 1980s demo slated for the follow up to ""The Lace"" but remained largely unfinished. In 2011 I was entrusted with the track and spent the next few years honing it. It finally saw the light of day last fall when original Cars member Greg Hawkes and Elliot Easton laid down their magic. Studio drumming legend John ""JR"" Robinson laid down his parts and co-produced the track with me. The track is to be included on the Kawasaki Disease project, a rare disease my little boy survived. Your donation (with perks) will allow this song to be included and released. I think we made Ben proud. The DHP needs your help paying for the mixing and mastering of the song for release. Without your help the song will sit until we're able to do it.</p>

<h3>The 'difficult' second album</h3>
<p>Tamar (Collocutor) has said that writing the music for 'The Search' was the easy part (not that we believe such modesty), however over the last two years 'Archaic Morning' (Collocutor's debut single) was released and followed shortly by the debut album, 'Instead'. Our goals of having the release on the shelves of Sounds of the Universe, being on Vinyl and getting a play from Gilles Peterson on 6Music were met almost immediately. We didn't expect that over the following months such wide reaching appreciation, from playing London Jazz Festival, Dingwalls and having wonderful things written about the album by Jazzwise, Straight No Chaser, Test Pressing etc we were without doubt quite humbled. </p>
<p>We have to build on that momentum and do justice to the reputation we've earned, we hope you agree. As mentioned above the hardest part of bringing this artistic vision to life and eventually on shelves, record players and headphones is raising the budget to record and engineer the music in a manner that does it justice.

Deeper Still will be just that – a deeper exploration, an invitation for solace, connection and transformation.

Beautiful, touching and inspirational, these are the songs that helped comfort and heal me as I journeyed through my own grief. I will be accompanied by some of the Bay Area’s finest musicians for a truly magical experience.</p><p><i>The Deeper Still Workshop</i> is an opportunity to learn how to use singing and sounding in your own life to heal, uplift and connect. We draw upon practices ranging from classical and contemporary vocal techniques, yoga, positive psychology and mind body awareness to create a program that is deep, enjoyable, and effective.</p><p><i>The Deeper Still Concert Experience: living with loss and happiness</i>, has been called transformative. I want to take this to groups who could benefit. With live musicians or tracks, I will share the beautiful songs and chants which helped me through my own journey through dark and light, as well as some singalongs and tunes to rock the house!</p><p>All funds raised will go to the creation and maintenance of this project, including Rehearsal Time, Development and Arranging, Vocal Arranging, Studio Musicians, Studio Engineer, Recording/Editing/Mixing, Copyright, Photos, Art/Graphic Design, Postage/Office supplies, ‘Bar coding’, and Duplication.</p><p>As a thank-you for your support, I’m sharing a number of gifts, or perks— from signed copies of the CD and a video of concert highlights to voice lessons, an awesome array of house concerts, and customized workshops.

From the cathedrals in Europe and theaters to cabaret clubs and recording studios, I have been blessed to be able to perform and live my message through music for my entire adult life.Deeper StillThe title of my campaign is inspired by the song Deeper Still by Beth Nielsen Chapman. The song reminds us that wherever life takes us-- through sorrows, fears and dreams-- “...you will always have what you gave to love.”This is a heartfelt evolution, building on my first album, Pure Imagination, and my other inspirational recordings. Deeper Still will be just that – a deeper exploration, an invitation for solace, connection and transformation. If you’re a person who has been touched by grief, and weren’t sure how to work through it, or how to help others who are suffering — this is how you can make a difference.Your contributions will make this all possible! I am putting my heart and soul into this project, and your contributions will help cover the costs of production of the Deeper Still CD and workshops materials.The Deeper Still CD is an album of songs that invite you to go deeper past the pain and disappointment that life often brings, to the love that is always present. Beautiful, touching and inspirational, these are the songs that helped comfort and heal me as I journeyed through my own grief. I will be accompanied by some of the Bay Area’s finest musicians for a truly magical experience.The Deeper Still Workshop is an opportunity to learn how to use singing and sounding in your own life to heal, uplift and connect. We draw upon practices ranging from classical and contemporary vocal techniques, yoga, positive psychology and mind body awareness to create a program that is deep, enjoyable, and effective.The Deeper Still Concert Experience: living with loss and happiness, has been called transformative. I want to take this to groups who could benefit. With live musicians or tracks, I will share the beautiful songs and chants which helped me through my own journey through dark and light, as well as some singalongs and tunes to rock the house!All funds raised will go to the creation and maintenance of this project, including Rehearsal Time, Development and Arranging, Vocal Arranging, Studio Musicians, Studio Engineer, Recording/Editing/Mixing, Copyright, Photos, Art/Graphic Design, Postage/Office supplies, ‘Bar coding’, and Duplication.As a thank-you for your support, I’m sharing a number of gifts, or perks— from signed copies of the CD and a video of concert highlights to voice lessons, an awesome array of house concerts, and customized workshops. I’m particularly excited about the perk of creative prints that will share my favorite singing mantras and life mottos-- like Heart to Heaven and Inhale Happy. Your support is greatly appreciated. Any and all contributions will help support my efforts, even if we don’t reach the full goal! Thank You!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><h3>Hi.</h3></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>We're Lion in The Mane and we're coming out with a new record! Our music touches people's lives every day. We asked ourselves how we could do something more this go around. Contributing portions of the proceeds to Autism Speaks gives us a way to help people in more ways than just music. Putting out a record through an online store or streaming site is an easy thing to do. Unfortunately, the band doesn't see much in return for you spending the same amount on our music regardless of where you get it; unless you get it directly from us. This gives you the opportunity to spend the same amount of money on the music (and other cool swag) and gives us both the opportunity to give back! </div> <div> <h3>Here's the skinny.<br/>
</h3>
<div>We have narrowed it down and we will need at least $4,620 to get this record out. Besides covering the costs of sending you all your perks, we plan on shooting a couple music videos, mastering the record at Gateway in Portland, ME by Grammy winning music masterer Adam Ayan, touring this spring on The American Gentlemen Tour, and donating proceeds from each bundle to Autism Speaks. Not to mention paying our lovely artist Laura Merizalde to do our CD cover art, copyrighting the album and getting the album pressed by our great friend Dominic at Oasis Disc Manufacturers. We have lots of work to do, but we are very excited about it.</div>
<div>We have put our heads together and are offering many different perks for donating. We're offering digital downloads of the new record ""Echoes in Absence"", signed physical copies of the album as well, stickers, t-shirts (specifically for this campaigns) signed drum heads used on The American Gentlemen tour by our very own Johnny Coryn, a signed acoustic guitar used in the acoustic sessions, acoustic sessions where we will play your favorite Lion in The Mane song and send it to you, signed copies of ""The Noise War"" (our first full length album), dinner with the band, an acoustic show live in your town specially for you, a full on rock show at your house, a guest list for life spot so you never have to worry about paying to come to a Lion in The Mane show. We're also offering hand written lyrics to your favorite Lion in The Mane song. And if you really really want him... Our very own Johnny Coryn will crash on your couch for a month. We do like him, so please return him just as we send him!</div>
<div>
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><h3>What Could go wrong, right?</h3></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>If the goal is not met, don't fret! We will still be sending out your perks and funding this release by borrowing money from large banks where will find ourselves in incredible debt and have a very hard time getting to come tour in your town! So help us out so we can meet our goal.
</div>
</div><div>Each donation (big or small) is valuable to us because it's one step closer to helping others. Last fall our very own Jon Masters nephew was diagnosed with moderate to severe autism. The band has always played at charities and been actively involved in supporting anti bullying, not texting and driving, the Get up and Move program (you can find a song we did called ""I'll come back for you"" on iTunes for the Thousand Hours Against Hate charity) but never has the band been directly effected like it was the past two years with Jon's family being at the center of their loved ones diagnosis. More than 200,000 cases of autism arise each year and although there is no cure, treatment often helps. So here's to hope for a cure and becoming more educated, so we can make progress and help put an end to this disorder. </div><div>
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><h3>You really want to help out but don't have the fundage at the moment. Well...<br/>
</h3></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>Everyone here at the Lion in The Mane camp are excited and appreciative of the years of support from our friends, fans and families. And remember, if you can't make a donation... There are many ways to help. You can help us out by sharing this link and telling your friends. You can help by educating yourself about autism or joining them on a charitable walk. You can help by spreading the word about the band, coming to a show or just turning up our music. So once again, from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you!</div></div>","Hi.We're Lion in The Mane and we're coming out with a new record! Our music touches people's lives every day.

Your actions, small as they can look, can change the world. 
Who is going to make that step that only you can do?
""I'm used to big dreams. I challenge myself with sacrifice, dedication and faith to accomplish my goals. For everyone I have the same answer of the last 15 years: This dream is big enough to make it my whole life. Even when it looks like I'm not working on it, I'm living this dream through every project I'm engaged into and with every person I've met... to make it better, to make them think about their own lifes and jobs and goals. This is a vision of the future we need. You want to share this vision in which our lifes become more significant through the development of a very human spiritual sensitivity? 
A great master told me once: The student of music, the artist, must understand that our jobs aren't jobs, not merely everyday activities. Art is our own life and you must take it seriously like the apostle. That's the reason why I'm doing this: to understand that life is more that the activity you're doing while breathing and eating, and art is our deep, true, natural language"" - Nicolás Ángel Cubillos

<h3>Welcome to Happy Hour</h3>
<p>So here’s the news… I am <strong>this</strong> close to releasing my next album! I love the way it sounds, and I can’t wait to share it with you.</p>
<p>Nils has done an amazing job producing and helping me with the song writing. He has produced a virtual string of Billboard Top 20’s. Honestly, I think this record has some of his best work. And mine!</p>
<p>Here are some of the things people are saying:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""He's 'Plan A' whenever you can!  A superb, classically trained saxophonist, he wears melodies like second skins. Tunes with TEETH!"" – <i>Trish Hennessey, Hybrid Jazz Radio</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""Charley Langer has nailed it with his latest release <i>Happy Hour</i>, as far as original and melodic grooves go. With great horn arrangements and a large overall presence, the album grabbed me from the first notes and wouldn't let go!"" <i>– Ronald Jackson, The Smooth Jazz Ride</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""Happy Hour</i> certainly lives up to its name!! An exciting selection of great tunes from Charley and a top selection of supporting musicians. Initial favourites include 'That Certain Feeling' and 'Big Sur,' but the whole album hits the spot!! An exciting addition to the playlist and highly recommended!"" – <i>Richard Edwards, SmoothGrooves Radio UK</i></p>
<p>This is my first time involving fans in the process of releasing my music. Why do it? Because I need some help (obviously). But more importantly, I have participated as a fan in other musical projects, and it’s fun! You’re going to get a behind-the-scenes look into my musical life, and a chance to get some cool stuff that the general public is never going to see. And every backer gets an early download of the entire album. NOTE: the download link will be emailed to you within 24 hours -- that’s way before the album release, expected early February 2017.</p>
<p>I have named the album <i>Happy Hour</i> because it’s a virtual happy hour, sans food and drink (you supply your own). This is a very fun, danceable, and distinctively happy collection of music. Please join Nils and me for <i>Happy Hour</i>!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Record labels spend millions of dollars on artwork, manufacturing, advertising, publicity, radio promotion, etc. I plan to do it all for only $7,500. But we could knock this one out of the park with $12,000!</p>
<p>I've already done the heavy lifting. The music is done. This album is going to be released even if I don't raise another cent. But the effect that this album can have is soooo much bigger if you help!</p>
<p>What you probably don't realize is that I am doing this for you. I constantly get emails asking me when I'm coming to New York, or Chicago, or Denver, or [name your city]. The truth is, to do that kind of touring requires venue owners who are willing to take a risk on me. And they are <strong>not</strong> going to do that for someone they have never heard of. Radio promotion and advertising can make the difference.</p>
<p>And, in the process of helping me, you have some fun opportunities! First of all, every backer gets an immediate digital download of the album. But you could also get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signed CDs and other exclusive memorabilia</li>
<li>Your name in the liner notes</li>
<li>A personalized birthday video for you or a friend</li>
<li>Time with me on Skype or FaceTime</li>
<li>A cover of a favorite song that I've recorded especially for you</li>
<li>Dinner with me and Nils</li>
<li>A picture painted and signed by me (I'm pretty good with a paint brush)</li>
<li>Maybe a concert in your own living room!</li>
</ul>
<p>And if I don't make my goal, I'll use whatever is raised to promote the heck out of this album.</p>
</div><div><h3>The Risk...?</h3></div><div><p>...well... you have none! You're going to get the digital download and whatever exclusive items you've paid for! My risk is: I might feel a little red-faced if I don't get a hit song from this album. But I can handle it. Humility is a good thing. And I'm not doing this for me anyway. I'm doing it for you.</p></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some of you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. Others of you might want to do a bit extra! Please use the Indiegogo share tools to help get the word out! They are at the upper right of this page and look like this:</p>

<h3>Thank you! I hope you enjoy <i>Happy Hour!</i>

Radio promotion and advertising can make the difference.
And, in the process of helping me, you have some fun opportunities! First of all, every backer gets an immediate digital download of the album. But you could also get:

Signed CDs and other exclusive memorabilia
Your name in the liner notes
A personalized birthday video for you or a friend
Time with me on Skype or FaceTime
A cover of a favorite song that I've recorded especially for you
Dinner with me and Nils
A picture painted and signed by me (I'm pretty good with a paint brush)
Maybe a concert in your own living room!

And if I don't make my goal, I'll use whatever is raised to promote the heck out of this album.
The Risk...?...well... you have none! You're going to get the digital download and whatever exclusive items you've paid for! My risk is: I might feel a little red-faced if I don't get a hit song from this album. But I can handle it. Humility is a good thing. And I'm not doing this for me anyway. I'm doing it for you.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Andrew Davis. iIf you're here then I'm pretty sure you may know who I am and how passionate I am about wanting to be a great musician. Since 2007, ""Andrew Davis has forever been served playing to his own drum."" - Brandon Caldwell, Houston Press. I reached out to my friend Sean Padilla in August about setting up a tour for me to run in NOV. I was in a dark space financially; being fired from Public Storage for a last strike offense of being on my phone on the floor; although I was clocked out for lunch I wasn't given a chance to explain. Yes, back then I predicted that I would be out of the financial struggle of job security by NOV. I have since been hired as a bank teller part time and have been working there for a little over a month.  I am extremely blessed and grateful to my job for allowing me to take the time off. Working part time, my 20hrs a week isn't enough to cover tour production costs as well as rent for NOV. So i did the right thing and went ahead and put aside my rent money and as I look at the rental car costs realize that i need a miracle to pull through for me to be able to get off the ground for the tour.</p>
<p>This is why I am asking for your help. Something, perhaps family, will come through for me to secure the rental car costs before I leave; I need you to support financially so that by the time the indie go go campaign is over the payout will be in enough time for me to stay afloat while on tour. Your support is instrumental to the launch and survival of the tour.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rental car costs range between $600-$750; I've driven to New York and back before so I am estimating gas to be around $300. I'm not tripping on food though I should be lol. Stacking up on lots of peanut butter and trying to get Per Diems from venues; little to no success.</li>
<li>Your donations will not go without reward. I am manufacturing Sweaters, Hats, and 4GB USB drives filled with content (entire discography, pics, and vids). People that donate in cities I play will be able to pull up to the show for free.</li>
<li>If I do not reach my goal the money raised will go straight towards gas.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>There's a part, while i'm building my indie go go campaign, that asks me to describe to you all why this is important to the world. I can say whole heartedly that I hope this inspires people to realize wen they need help and to not be afraid or too proud to reach out. Pride is a real thing I have to overcome and I'm thankful for the ability to make strides towards that.</li>
<li>This is my first time touring a string of shows as such. In the past i've played pop up shows in different cities but never to this magnitude; so I am excited about new challenges .</li>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The songs on this CD are truly world music, combining traditional and modern flamenco with elements of Brazilian jazz and Middle Eastern music. They represent our current repertoire, so audiences who hear us on tour will be able to take our sounds home.</p>
<p>The music is ready to go, so we need your help to generate funds to complete the project. We've already completed our initial studio sessions at Brokenworks Studios in Ashland, OR on October 7-9. We have more sessions coming up October 21-22 and beyond. We've carefully estimated all of our costs for recording, mixing, CD duplication, artwork, and packaging - all the nuts and bolts stuff that goes into making a quality product.</p>
<p>Let's break it down in more detail for you. We're aiming to raise $10,700. This will cover $3,600 in recording, mixing, and mastering sessions; $3,400 in duplication and packaging costs; and $1,500 in art and layout fees. Our sound engineer is the highly skilled Sean McCoy of Oregon Sound (oregonsound.com) in Ashland. We're working with discmakers.com for packaging, fretless bassist extraordinaire Randy Tico from Santa Barbara, and a very talented artist in Spain named Julian Lorenzo for the artwork and layout. (He's also a flamenco guitarist, singer, and professional skateboarder.) We are also recording with percussionist Terry Longshore and dancer Elena Villa, who have appeared often with Flamenco Pacifico on stage. The fee for the extra artists on our project will come to $2,200, and we're very happy to be supporting them as part of our efforts as well.</p>
<p>We want you to know, we're not asking you all to pay for the whole project. The numbers above are our best estimate for basic costs for an album that will most likely cost $15,000.  If you help us get started with the basic costs, we'll cover the rest, no matter what it takes to get you a fantastic album!</p>
<p>We're happy to offer several perks for whatever level you'd like to contribute. You can pre-purchase your CD (plus shipping) or download cards. You can get signed CDs and guitar lessons over Skype or personal dance lessons. You can be be given credit as a producer on the CD. You can sign up for a private house concert, all the way from solo guitar to a quartet show. You can even fund visits by the troupe to your favorite schools!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The world needs more original, deep art! You'll be helping us fund a lifetime of musical study and creation to distill it into a product that will move and inspire people. All of us in Flamenco Pacifico are earnest artists and hardworking professionals who perform and teach on a regular basis and make their livelihoods from their passions. Berto Boyd, Grant Ruiz, and Terry Longshore have all recorded successful CDs in the past and believe this unique collaboration will stand out.</p>
<p>Integrity is very important to us, and we look forward to fulfilling each and every one of the perks listed in this campaign as an expression of our passion and gratitude.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's always a risk that a project won't be completed or completed to satisfaction; however, we put months into preparation and pre-production for this album. These pieces are tried and true. We've played them in concert many times in large venues and have polished them, so we are confident that we will complete the recording process on time and have a quality product to share. We have two CD release concerts scheduled at the Majestic Theater in Corvallis, OR January 27-28, so you can BET we're motivated!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that some folks may not be able to help us financially at this point, but anything you can do to get the word out would be much appreciated. Check out our website at flamencopacifico.com, ""like"" us on Facebook (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FlamencoPacifico/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/FlamencoPacifico/</a>). If you have any friends who are interested in flamenco, let them know about us and our CD project! Email, text, tweet, message, carrier pigeon, smoke signals, whatever it takes.</p>
<p>We're very proud of our school residency perk, so if you know anybody involved in school music programs or funding them, please let them know about us as well. Thanks!</p>

<h3>My Sophomore EP</h3>
<p>This next record is a follow up to my last EP ""Seasons"". Entitled ""Room for Love""</p>
<p>My name is Sarah Petrella and I am a songwriter born and raised in Southern California. Music has been a HUGE part of my life ever since I was a very little girl. I love being able to witness my own self grow and evolve through my music but most of all I love sharing it with all of you!</p>
<p>I have come a long way over the last few years. I have written and recorded a lot of tunes. But SO much goes into making an album. Producing, mixing, mastering, the musicians, the artwork, the printing, the marketing and the promotion. I am very close to finishing this next EP but I need your help to finish it off.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>YOU are the Record Label</h3>
<p>I have already funded a large portion of this next EP on my own. I have recorded many of the songs already, but still have a lot to do. This is my FIRST campaign and my very first time asking for help from fans. Being able to use a platform like IndieGoGo allows me to have the artistic freedom of an independent artist while allowing the people that support my music to act as my Record Label.</p>
<p>Where the Money Goes</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, I will be filming my music video for the title track ""Room For Love"". I have a plan for the video and it is going to be incredible. Just need the funds to make it a reality. Budgeted 3k</li>
<li>Finish recording the final tracks. Musicians. Mixing. Mastering. Budgeted 2k</li>
<li>Next I need to distribute the EP online and print the physical copies. Budgeted 2k</li>
<li>Merchandise Budget $500</li>
<li>Advertising/Promotion Budgeted 2k</li>
<li>Indie Go Go Fee percentage $500</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>I have so many fun gifts for you to choose from for being apart of this journey with me!</p>
<p>If I don't reach the goal I am asking for, I will have to trim down on my plans but will still make this project come to life. If I exceed the goal I am asking for I will be able to fund as much promotion as possible. Either way, if you donate, this music will be in your hands no matter what!</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand if you aren't in a position to help financially right now. But your support alone means SO much. So please share, share, share with everyone you know who may be interested in helping me. Share on social media, call your friends on the phone personally and encourage them to donate, every little bit of that helps.</p>I CAN NOT WAIT TO BRING YOU MORE MUSIC!!</div></div>","My Sophomore EP

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a singer/songwriter. I believe in writing authentic, raw, and honest songs ESPECIALLY for myself as an artist. I've lived in Nashville for 12 years now and I've always been a writer, as far back as I can remember there was always a notebook of some kind with me or close by. I love what I do and I don't believe that age or background or anything should ever hold someone back from pursuing their dreams....which leads us HERE!!! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking to raise $15,000. This would cover studio fees, musicians, producer, any overages, Product duplication, album photo shoot. It also leaves a small cushion for any incidentals not specifically budget for (kinda like building a house :)</p>
<p>If we surpass the goal, I may even be able to have proper merchandising and maybe even release another single to radio again, which would make my heart incredibly happy.  :)</p>
<p>As you might guess, getting off the ground and making a record is an expensive endeavor. I have exhausted all that my own personal budget will allow at this point.</p>
<p>That's where you come in. I've come up with a few ways for you to get involved. It could be as simple as helping me spread the word, or pre-ordering your very own shirt or CD. If you are feeling really generous and want to go all out you can spring for one of the higher end options. I'm hoping that each of these items is guaranteed to please even the most discriminating of crowd funders. Come hang out at a recording session, or have dinner with me, get a mix tape or a one on one vocal lesson or cowrite with me! Along with a few other social items including my book ""Love, IZZ"", signed lyrics and more.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Thank you in advance.....</h3>
<p>This project can not happen without you, and I am humbled by that. If you can't help financially, please consider sharing it with your friends and family! Let's make a record shall we?!?!?!</p>

And for decades she has done just that. However now she needs your help to keep that mission alive.


She has recorded and mastered a new set of songs in Austin Texas, and Mixed and Mastered in Nashville to release as a limited EP.
However funds for CD production are not there. 
This is where you can help, but not for free, no that's not Scooter's style. She wants to make sure you get what you pay for. 
   What We Need & What You Get With that in mind:  We need a total of $3000 to make this dream a reality. This money will be used for the production of CDs as well as merchandising to sell at shows and in the online marketplace. Roughly $2000 is needed to produce CDs with a beautiful cover and booklet. The rest will go strictly to production of T-Shirts, pins, stickers and other Scooter branded apparel. $10 dollar pledge= Copy of new EP
$25 dollar pledge=Signed copy of new EP
$50 dollar pledge=Signed copy of new Ep as well as a personalized thank you included in CD booklet!
$75 dollar pledge=Signed copy of new Ep, Personalized thank you in booklet, and Scooter Pearce T-Shirt(Design in progress) IF on the chance we don't reach our goal, rest assured that the funds raised will still go strictly to production of the CDs and everyone who pledged will still receive their pledge level gift, added time may simply be needed.    The Impact Everydollar raised would make an enormous impact on the project's viability. With CD production and Merchandise costing as much as they do, without the help of your contributions it may be another year before We are able to reserve the funds needed on our own.  This EP will contain previously unreleased songs such as ""Let it Rain,"" and ""Grace of Angels."" Songs that have only been available at live performances. Your contributions will help Scooter get the wider recognition she deserves as well as the increased fan base she works so hard to make a connection with.    Risks & Challenges The best part of this project is simply that there is no risk. All of the songs are already, mixed and mastered and ready for production.

<h4 style=""text-align: right;"">-<i> Who We Are, and Our Mission</i>
</h4>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
</h3>The J-MUSIC Ensemble was once just a humble idea based on a passion for Japanese music, and a dream to bring new ideas based on it to the world. Influences from games such as Sonic the Hedgehog, Pokemon, and Final Fantasy, anime such as Cowboy Bebop and Naruto, and J-Pop artists like Perfume and Utada Hikaru were the context for this dream. Three years ago at the Manhattan School of Music, the band became a reality, and pure joy and happiness overcame every rehearsal and school performance we had - we were exploring our favorite songs, as well as new ones, and finding ways to get deeper into this music. However, after leaving the nest of college, the ""real world"" hit hard, and pressures to get serious about the presentation of our music became realized. It was time for us to get these songs recorded, and eventually released to reach more people who shared the same love as us - but we soon came to understand that this was not going to be easy. <br/><br/><h2 style=""text-align: right;"">始まり</h2>
<h4 style=""text-align: right;"">- 僕たちについて - 僕たちの使命について</h4>
<br/>J-MUSIC Ensemble は元々は日本の音楽への情熱に基づくほんのアイディアで、その新しいアイディアを発表するという夢に過ぎませんでした。この夢の背景には、ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ、ポケモン、ファイナルファンタジーといったゲーム、カウボーイ・ビバップや Naruto といったアニメ、また Perfume や宇多田ヒカルといった J-Popの影響がありました。このバンドは、3年前にマンハッタン音楽学校で現実のものとなり、純粋な喜びと幸せがあらゆるリハーサル、学内パフォーマンスで満ち溢れました。僕たちのお気に入りの曲を探し、この音楽をより深く理解する方法を追求いていました。しかしながら、大学を出て、現実社会に直面し、僕たちの音楽を本気で社会に打ち出していくためのプレッシャーに気がつきました。これらの曲をレコーディングし、発売して、僕たちと同じ情熱を持つより多くの人たちに僕たちの音楽を届けること、それは決して簡単なことではないと気がついたのです。<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F4uxGtuifFaQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4uxGtuifFaQ&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F4uxGtuifFaQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>
</div> <div> <h2 style=""text-align: right;"">
<br/>Journey</h2>
<h4 style=""text-align: right;""><i>- Costs, Risks, and Perks<br/></i></h4>
<p>We were able to scrap our money together from previous shows and get into a reasonable studio. However, there were other costs that we needed to be aware of. On top of studio costs, mixing costs, and mastering costs, there were also <b>licensing fees</b>
 - money paid to publishing companies and copyright holders for 
permission to record and release this music legally. These costs aren't 
always concrete, and are usually based on certain criteria defined 
either by the industry or the copyright holders themselves - and without paying them, we can run into serious legal trouble that would hinder us from producing any more music. These fees 
are super important to us, because this is the only real way we can pay 
respect to the composers and artists that have affected us so deeply 
since childhood.  <br/></p>
<b>Mixing - $1000</b><br/><b>Mastering - $800<br/>Physical CD Distribution - $1000<br/>Album Artwork/Design ~ $300<br/>Licensing Fees ~ $500-800<br/>Publicity and Promotion ~ $2,500<br/></b> <br/>
It is because of these incredible costs, and our current difficulty in producing these funds at our current stage, that we ask for your help in bringing this album to life. We are extremely grateful for our friends and family, and in return for your help, we'll give you some amazing things to take home with you (or download)! We'd also like you to know that ANY contribution you make will get your name on our ""J-MUSIC Alliance Team Wall"" on our website, making you an official member of the J-MUSIC Alliance!<br/><br/>Perks start at $1, and by doing so, you already get your name on our J-MUSIC Alliance Team Wall! Moving up between $5 - $50, you get prizes including free stickers, discounted pre-orders, T-shirts, signed CDs, and more! There are rewards at every level, because we really want you to know how much we appreciate your help.<br/><br/><h2 style=""text-align: right;"">旅路</h2>
<h4 style=""text-align: right;"">- 費用、リスク、特典</h4>
<br/>僕たちは過去のショーからのお金をかき集めて、リーズナブルなレコーディングスタジオに入ることができました。しかしながら、他の諸々のコストに気がつきます。スタジオ費用に加え、ミキシング費用、マスタリング費用、そしてライセンス料(この音楽を合法的に録音、発売する許可を得るために出版社や著作権保持者に支払うお金)です。ライセンス料は常に具体的ではありませんが、音楽業界または著作権保持者自身によって決められたある基準に基づいています。そしてこれを支払わなければ、今後一切音楽の制作活動ができなくなるという重大な法的問題へと発展します。この料金は僕たちにとって、ものすごく大切です。なぜなら、これが僕たちに子供の頃から絶大な影響を与えてきた作曲家やアーティストへの敬意を払う唯一の本当の方法だからです。<br/><br/><b>ミキシング - $1000 (約 10 万円)<br/>マスタリング - $800 (約8万円)<br/>CD 流通 - $1000 (約10万円)<br/>アルバムカバーデザイン - $300 (約3万円)<br/>ライセンス料 - $500-800 (約5万〜8万円)</b><br/><b>宣伝、プロモーション- $2,500 (約25万円)</b><br/><br/>これらの莫大な費用、そしてこれらの資金を生み出すのが困難である僕たちの現状から、このアルバムを世に送り出すためにあなたのご協力をお願いしたいと思っています。僕たちの友達や家族に非常に感謝し、支援いただいた方々には、素晴らしいものを持って帰って(ダウンロードして)いただき、恩返しをしたいと思っています。また、貢献をしてくださった全ての方のお名前は僕たちのウェブサイトの“J-MUSIC アライアンス・チーム・ウォール”に刻ませていただき、J-MUSIC アライアンスのオフィシャル・メンバーになっていただけます。<br/><br/>特典は1ドル(約100円)から始まり、1ドル(約100円)の貢献をいただくだけでもあなたのお名前は J-MUSIC アライアンス・チーム・ウォールに刻まれます!さらに5ドル(約500円)〜50ドル(約5000円)になると、シールや、イベントの発売前チケットのディスカウント、T シャツ、サイン入り CD などなど、特典が盛り沢山!僕たちがあなたのヘルプにどれだけ感謝しているかを知ってもらいたいのです!<br/> </div> <div> <h2 style=""text-align: right;"">Continuum<br/>

<h4 style=""text-align: right;"">
<i>- The Impact, Giving Back</i><br/>
</h4>
<p>Your help in this campaign does a lot more than just help us release our album - you're helping us serve as an example for the future. Most of us in the band come from situations where music was not the first thing pushed as a career option; combine that with an already skewed and negative view on video games and Japanese anime, and you have a recipe for seriously low motivation in a child's artistic dreams, and their development. While we were able to push through by ourselves, and with the encouragement of mentors, there are others who may be feeling the same way about their favorite alternate interests and don't have a platform to express those interests. We want to eventually build communities for those even younger than us to learn about music, how to play music, and how to mold their dreams into a reality. They'll be able to learn how to combine a knowledge of music with an interest in video games, anime, and pop culture in order to turn an otherwise innocent, hidden interest into potentially the greatest art our future can hold.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: right;"">続き</h2>
<h4 style=""text-align: right;"">- 影響力、還元</h4>
<p>このキャンペーンにおけるあなたのご協力は、僕たちのアルバムのリリースを助けるだけではありません。 あなたは、未来のための実例となることを支えることとなります。  バンドメンバーのほとんどが、ビデオゲームや日本のアニメに対する歪んだネガティヴな意見とも合わさり、キャリアの選択において音楽が一番に持ってこられない状況を経験してきました。そしてあなたは、子供らのアーティスティックな夢と発達における深刻なまでに低いモチベーションに対する処方箋を持つことになるのです。 僕たちが良き指導者たちの励ましとともに頑張る一方、恐らく別のお気に入りのものに対して同じように感じている人たちもいて、その興味のあることを表現する場がない人たちもいます。 僕たちはやがては、より若い人たちのために、音楽や、音楽を演奏する方法や、彼らの夢を実現する方法を学べるコミュニティーを作りたいと思っています。 そこでは純真な、隠された興味を、潜在的に偉大な未来の芸術へと変えるために、音楽の知識をいかにしてビデオゲームやアニメ、ポップカルチャーへの興味と結び付けるかを学ぶことができるでしょう。<br/></p>

However, after leaving the nest of college, the ""real world"" hit hard, and pressures to get serious about the presentation of our music became realized. It was time for us to get these songs recorded, and eventually released to reach more people who shared the same love as us - but we soon came to understand that this was not going to be easy. 始まり
- 僕たちについて - 僕たちの使命について
J-MUSIC Ensemble は元々は日本の音楽への情熱に基づくほんのアイディアで、その新しいアイディアを発表するという夢に過ぎませんでした。この夢の背景には、ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ、ポケモン、ファイナルファンタジーといったゲーム、カウボーイ・ビバップや Naruto といったアニメ、また Perfume や宇多田ヒカルといった J-Popの影響がありました。このバンドは、3年前にマンハッタン音楽学校で現実のものとなり、純粋な喜びと幸せがあらゆるリハーサル、学内パフォーマンスで満ち溢れました。僕たちのお気に入りの曲を探し、この音楽をより深く理解する方法を追求いていました。しかしながら、大学を出て、現実社会に直面し、僕たちの音楽を本気で社会に打ち出していくためのプレッシャーに気がつきました。これらの曲をレコーディングし、発売して、僕たちと同じ情熱を持つより多くの人たちに僕たちの音楽を届けること、それは決して簡単なことではないと気がついたのです。
  
Journey
- Costs, Risks, and Perks
We were able to scrap our money together from previous shows and get into a reasonable studio. However, there were other costs that we needed to be aware of. On top of studio costs, mixing costs, and mastering costs, there were also licensing fees
 - money paid to publishing companies and copyright holders for 
permission to record and release this music legally. These costs aren't 
always concrete, and are usually based on certain criteria defined 
either by the industry or the copyright holders themselves - and without paying them, we can run into serious legal trouble that would hinder us from producing any more music. These fees 
are super important to us, because this is the only real way we can pay 
respect to the composers and artists that have affected us so deeply 
since childhood.  
Mixing - $1000Mastering - $800Physical CD Distribution - $1000Album Artwork/Design ~ $300Licensing Fees ~ $500-800Publicity and Promotion ~ $2,500 
It is because of these incredible costs, and our current difficulty in producing these funds at our current stage, that we ask for your help in bringing this album to life. We are extremely grateful for our friends and family, and in return for your help, we'll give you some amazing things to take home with you (or download)! We'd also like you to know that ANY contribution you make will get your name on our ""J-MUSIC Alliance Team Wall"" on our website, making you an official member of the J-MUSIC Alliance!Perks start at $1, and by doing so, you already get your name on our J-MUSIC Alliance Team Wall! Moving up between $5 - $50, you get prizes including free stickers, discounted pre-orders, T-shirts, signed CDs, and more! There are rewards at every level, because we really want you to know how much we appreciate your help.旅路
- 費用、リスク、特典
僕たちは過去のショーからのお金をかき集めて、リーズナブルなレコーディングスタジオに入ることができました。しかしながら、他の諸々のコストに気がつきます。スタジオ費用に加え、ミキシング費用、マスタリング費用、そしてライセンス料(この音楽を合法的に録音、発売する許可を得るために出版社や著作権保持者に支払うお金)です。ライセンス料は常に具体的ではありませんが、音楽業界または著作権保持者自身によって決められたある基準に基づいています。そしてこれを支払わなければ、今後一切音楽の制作活動ができなくなるという重大な法的問題へと発展します。この料金は僕たちにとって、ものすごく大切です。なぜなら、これが僕たちに子供の頃から絶大な影響を与えてきた作曲家やアーティストへの敬意を払う唯一の本当の方法だからです。ミキシング - $1000 (約 10 万円)マスタリング - $800 (約8万円)CD 流通 - $1000 (約10万円)アルバムカバーデザイン - $300 (約3万円)ライセンス料 - $500-800 (約5万〜8万円)宣伝、プロモーション- $2,500 (約25万円)これらの莫大な費用、そしてこれらの資金を生み出すのが困難である僕たちの現状から、このアルバムを世に送り出すためにあなたのご協力をお願いしたいと思っています。僕たちの友達や家族に非常に感謝し、支援いただいた方々には、素晴らしいものを持って帰って(ダウンロードして)いただき、恩返しをしたいと思っています。また、貢献をしてくださった全ての方のお名前は僕たちのウェブサイトの“J-MUSIC アライアンス・チーム・ウォール”に刻ませていただき、J-MUSIC アライアンスのオフィシャル・メンバーになっていただけます。特典は1ドル(約100円)から始まり、1ドル(約100円)の貢献をいただくだけでもあなたのお名前は J-MUSIC アライアンス・チーム・ウォールに刻まれます!さらに5ドル(約500円)〜50ドル(約5000円)になると、シールや、イベントの発売前チケットのディスカウント、T シャツ、サイン入り CD などなど、特典が盛り沢山!僕たちがあなたのヘルプにどれだけ感謝しているかを知ってもらいたいのです!   Continuum


- The Impact, Giving Back

Your help in this campaign does a lot more than just help us release our album - you're helping us serve as an example for the future. Most of us in the band come from situations where music was not the first thing pushed as a career option; combine that with an already skewed and negative view on video games and Japanese anime, and you have a recipe for seriously low motivation in a child's artistic dreams, and their development. While we were able to push through by ourselves, and with the encouragement of mentors, there are others who may be feeling the same way about their favorite alternate interests and don't have a platform to express those interests. We want to eventually build communities for those even younger than us to learn about music, how to play music, and how to mold their dreams into a reality. They'll be able to learn how to combine a knowledge of music with an interest in video games, anime, and pop culture in order to turn an otherwise innocent, hidden interest into potentially the greatest art our future can hold.

- 影響力、還元
このキャンペーンにおけるあなたのご協力は、僕たちのアルバムのリリースを助けるだけではありません。 あなたは、未来のための実例となることを支えることとなります。  バンドメンバーのほとんどが、ビデオゲームや日本のアニメに対する歪んだネガティヴな意見とも合わさり、キャリアの選択において音楽が一番に持ってこられない状況を経験してきました。そしてあなたは、子供らのアーティスティックな夢と発達における深刻なまでに低いモチベーションに対する処方箋を持つことになるのです。 僕たちが良き指導者たちの励ましとともに頑張る一方、恐らく別のお気に入りのものに対して同じように感じている人たちもいて、その興味のあることを表現する場がない人たちもいます。 僕たちはやがては、より若い人たちのために、音楽や、音楽を演奏する方法や、彼らの夢を実現する方法を学べるコミュニティーを作りたいと思っています。 そこでは純真な、隠された興味を、潜在的に偉大な未来の芸術へと変えるために、音楽の知識をいかにしてビデオゲームやアニメ、ポップカルチャーへの興味と結び付けるかを学ぶことができるでしょう。

<p><br/></p>
<p>Music is an integral part of African cultures.  It often permeates 
every aspect of life.  LA Rota grew up in Kenya in a house that was 
abundant with love and music - but not a lot of anything else.</p>Ms Rota cannot remember a time when she was not singing at home, at church and in school.  She has sung in competitions and won many awards including signing with a record label.<p><br/></p>
<p>Through all of this, she has continued with her education.  She is currently enrolled in Kenyatta University studying psychology and business management.</p>
<p>Living a life without many things is something Ms Rota knows well.  Her father died when she was two years old.  Her mother struggled to provide for her and her five siblings.  They had times when they were hungry and times when they were homeless.</p>
<p>Having faced these hardships has driven her to a life of giving.  She volunteers at St Martin School in Kibera, Kenya (Kibera is the biggest slum in Africa and one of the biggest in the world).  She has learned that, as much as kids need an education to better their lives, they need hope and inspiration.  She is hoping she can utilize her musical talents to not only better her life and that of her family, but to also give to the students at St Martin School a view of how their future can be brighter, too.</p>
<p>Wazimu and Moja World have brought together LA Rota with Hot Sun Films (also based in Kibera) to make her first music video.  She is looking for this to help catapult her career and get her in a better place to contribute the the future of the people of Kenya -- especially in Kibera.  <br/></p>
<p>Hot Sun Films has operated the Kibera Film School training students from Kibera to have skills to work in the film, television and other industries.  Many of the alums are hired by the Kibera Film School to teach and work on the  production side of the organization, Hot Sun Films.  The students only pay 1/3 of the cost of their training.  The balance of the funds is brought in through the Hot Sun Foundation and through Hot Sun Films (such as the making of this music video).  Hot Sun Films stays with the highest of global industry including utilizing the best of the best equipment including the Red Dragon camera &amp; Zeiss lenses.<br/></p>By contributing, you are not only supporting LA Rota in forwarding her career, you are helping the kids at the St Martin School, Hot Sun Films, and the students at the Kibera Film School.  That's what we call ""More bang for the buck!""<br/>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>The campaign is asking for $15,000.  <br/><br/>The making of the music video with Hot Sun Films will cost almost $10,000. <br/>(This includes payment of all those involved in the production of the music video including students and alums of the Kibera Film School.)<br/><br/>LA Rota's costs for the campaign and also her school fees for this year are approximately $5,000.<br/>(This will allow Ms Rota to focus on her studies, her singing career and helping the students at the St Martin school.  Without this, the campaign could not happen, and Ms Rota's time would be spent in raising funds for tuition).<br/>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>The impact will be felt on so many levels.  Not only will it directly elevate LA Rota's life, it will help all the children at the St Martin School in Kibera and provide support for the continued operation of Hot Sun Films.  St Martin School, the Kibera Film  School &amp; Hot Sun Films all contribute to a better life for all in Kibera, Kenya.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

</div></div>","The Campaign

Music is an integral part of African cultures.  It often permeates 
every aspect of life.  LA Rota grew up in Kenya in a house that was 
abundant with love and music - but not a lot of anything else.Ms Rota cannot remember a time when she was not singing at home, at church and in school.  She has sung in competitions and won many awards including signing with a record label.
Through all of this, she has continued with her education.  She is currently enrolled in Kenyatta University studying psychology and business management.
Living a life without many things is something Ms Rota knows well.  Her father died when she was two years old.  Her mother struggled to provide for her and her five siblings.  They had times when they were hungry and times when they were homeless.
Having faced these hardships has driven her to a life of giving.  She volunteers at St Martin School in Kibera, Kenya (Kibera is the biggest slum in Africa and one of the biggest in the world).  She has learned that, as much as kids need an education to better their lives, they need hope and inspiration.  She is hoping she can utilize her musical talents to not only better her life and that of her family, but to also give to the students at St Martin School a view of how their future can be brighter, too.
Wazimu and Moja World have brought together LA Rota with Hot Sun Films (also based in Kibera) to make her first music video.  She is looking for this to help catapult her career and get her in a better place to contribute the the future of the people of Kenya -- especially in Kibera.  
Hot Sun Films has operated the Kibera Film School training students from Kibera to have skills to work in the film, television and other industries.  Many of the alums are hired by the Kibera Film School to teach and work on the  production side of the organization, Hot Sun Films.  The students only pay 1/3 of the cost of their training.  The balance of the funds is brought in through the Hot Sun Foundation and through Hot Sun Films (such as the making of this music video).  Hot Sun Films stays with the highest of global industry including utilizing the best of the best equipment including the Red Dragon camera & Zeiss lenses.By contributing, you are not only supporting LA Rota in forwarding her career, you are helping the kids at the St Martin School, Hot Sun Films, and the students at the Kibera Film School.  That's what we call ""More bang for the buck!""
  
What We Need & What You GetThe campaign is asking for $15,000.  The making of the music video with Hot Sun Films will cost almost $10,000. (This includes payment of all those involved in the production of the music video including students and alums of the Kibera Film School.)LA Rota's costs for the campaign and also her school fees for this year are approximately $5,000.(This will allow Ms Rota to focus on her studies, her singing career and helping the students at the St Martin school.  Without this, the campaign could not happen, and Ms Rota's time would be spent in raising funds for tuition).
  
The ImpactThe impact will be felt on so many levels.  Not only will it directly elevate LA Rota's life, it will help all the children at the St Martin School in Kibera and provide support for the continued operation of Hot Sun Films.  St Martin School, the Kibera Film  School & Hot Sun Films all contribute to a better life for all in Kibera, Kenya.
  
Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge will be raising funds in the amount needed to produce the quality of video wanted.  Ms Rota's video will be of a quality that it can be launched on the international stage not only putting her and her music in the spot light, it will help all of those she, Hot Sun Films, the Kibera Film School and The St Martin School touch in Kibera.
  
Other Ways You Can HelpPlease, pass information of the campaign to all of your friends.  If you are ever in Kenya, please spend some time in Kibera volunteering at Hot Sun Films and/or The St Martin School.  Listen to LA Rota's music on Reberb Nation: https://www.reverbnation.com/larota and on SoundCloud: www.soundcloud.com/laurriette-rotaLearn more about Hot Sun Films and the Kibera Film School:  hotsunfilms.com and hotsunfilmschool.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Story</h3> <p></p>
<p>I am a violinist who plays contemporary music. Pianist Brent Funderburk and I have been working together- performing, touring and recording- for 5 years. Our first CD, released in 2012 by Albany Records, contained music by Mozart, Schubert, Schoenberg, George Perle, and Elliott Carter. We just recorded our second album, Wild Cities.</p>
<p>The name ""Wild Cities"" is inspired by the poem ""After Dead Souls"" by Allen Ginsberg. In it, Ginsberg asks, ""Where O America are you/going in your glorious/automobile….toward what wild city/jumping with jazz/on the Pacific Ocean?"" This classic image inspired generations of composers who were trying to forge a uniquely American musical identity. The Ginsberg poem suggests both a journey and a destination that is both exciting and unknown, concepts that we explore in the album. Wild Cities is a journey through the new landscape of American music. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Project &amp; Budget</h3> <p></p>
<p>We're excited to share this amazing music with you and hope you will be moved to support it! </p>
<p>We recorded the album at the new Concert Hall at the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts in St. Paul, MN. We paid for these sessions with a combination of grants and personal savings.

At these festivals we provide an unforgettable experience that includes activities, a space for workshops and yoga, food and even costumes for ultimate self expression. Our team works together as a unit to collaborate with other artists, builders, and creatives who have so much to offer to the festival attendees. Yes, we do all of it for fun! WHY?

several areas that will have flowing fabrics, beautiful lighting, and painted backdrops, featuring free amenities like yoga workshops, food, and a pop up costume shop. We will have approximately 50 members who are part of our group, most of whom will be donating volunteer hours and supplies for our camp to use.

<br/><h3 align=""center""><b>WHAT HAS THE BRIGHT PEOPLE COLLECTIVE DONE IN THE PAST?</b></h3>
<b><br/></b><ul><li>In August 2012 the first Bright People event in downtown LA showcased 10 local artists , 5 Los Angeles dj's and an electronic band all under one roof. Art and photography was on display, live bodypainting took place, collaborative art unfolded, and door prizes were given out. Approximately 120 people attended our first event. Each one left inspired.<br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>In December 2014 the second Bright People event was held in downtown Los Angeles. It was significantly larger than the first, and proved to be a quality event with quality performers. Five professional visual artists were featured along with body art and 6 amazing dj's in a 250 person capacity venue. <br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Three months later in March 2015, the Bright People collective was invited as a featured art theme camp at the Desert Hearts Spring Festival. This was a pivotal event that brought our community together and solidified Bright People as a collective of art and music lovers who were here to stay. We raised our goal of $1,200 in order to provide festival goers with free grilled cheese sandwiches cooked by our resident dj's, a free festival costume clothing boutique with free clothing, and collaborated to build a custom built chillpsace with art on display. Our featured artists held workshops and did live art for all to see.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Various community events including a free park party, sign painting and tie dye party, and our Backyard Boogie party where we painted, made jewelry, and danced to our community dj's<br/>

We encourage community collaboration and dedicate our time to helping those around us foster their creativity.What are we crowdfunding for?We are holding a crowdfunding campaign to purchase the supplies we need to create amazing environments at transformational festivals. At these festivals we provide an unforgettable experience that includes activities, a space for workshops and yoga, food and even costumes for ultimate self expression. Our team works together as a unit to collaborate with other artists, builders, and creatives who have so much to offer to the festival attendees. Yes, we do all of it for fun! WHY? Because we're passionate about art, music, and self-expression and we want to provide a space for people to enjoy. GO CAMP BRIGHT PEOPLE!!This money we raise in this crowdfunding campaign is dedicated to our featured art space, ""CAMP BRIGHT PEOPLE"",  at the Desert Hearts Music Festival in November 2015. Desert Hearts is an outdoor, bi-annual 3,000 person art and music festival on the Los Coyotes Indian Reservation just outside San Diego, CA. For the second time this year, Camp Bright 
People will be designated our very own area at the outdoor festival. In our designated area (which we have been given full creative artistic freedom) for the second time this year, we will create an environment for the whole crowd to enjoy. Our goal is to decorate this a football field sized space with 
several areas that will have flowing fabrics, beautiful lighting, and painted backdrops, featuring free amenities like yoga workshops, food, and a pop up costume shop. We will have approximately 50 members who are part of our group, most of whom will be donating volunteer hours and supplies for our camp to use. This is a group effort and teamwork truly makes the dream work in every sense.Where will your donations go?

WHAT HAS THE BRIGHT PEOPLE COLLECTIVE DONE IN THE PAST?
In August 2012 the first Bright People event in downtown LA showcased 10 local artists , 5 Los Angeles dj's and an electronic band all under one roof. Art and photography was on display, live bodypainting took place, collaborative art unfolded, and door prizes were given out. Approximately 120 people attended our first event. Each one left inspired.

In December 2014 the second Bright People event was held in downtown Los Angeles. It was significantly larger than the first, and proved to be a quality event with quality performers. Five professional visual artists were featured along with body art and 6 amazing dj's in a 250 person capacity venue. 

Three months later in March 2015, the Bright People collective was invited as a featured art theme camp at the Desert Hearts Spring Festival. This was a pivotal event that brought our community together and solidified Bright People as a collective of art and music lovers who were here to stay. We raised our goal of $1,200 in order to provide festival goers with free grilled cheese sandwiches cooked by our resident dj's, a free festival costume clothing boutique with free clothing, and collaborated to build a custom built chillpsace with art on display. Our featured artists held workshops and did live art for all to see.
Various community events including a free park party, sign painting and tie dye party, and our Backyard Boogie party where we painted, made jewelry, and danced to our community dj's

<p>Friends, Family, Fans and Lovers of song! Jason bid on some discounted studio time with a local artist, Ted Kamp, at a charity auction here in LA, and we won it! I went into the studio last week and we layed down 5 amazing tracks which I've shared a snippet of here with you. I'm so excited, BUT now I need to pay the musicians, mix and master the recording, pay music royalties, obtain artwork and then press the CD's! Whew. It ain't simple.</p>
<p>Although I got a great start with the studio time, I do need additional funds to make the rest happen, otherwise it's just a digital recording that I can't hand to the people I love or that I want to work with! I'd be immensely grateful if you are able to assist in making this vision a reality. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I'm calling on you to help support my first studio recording EVER! It's time to take the music I love to sing to live venues around LA and wherever I can, to book work and to share with fans. This EP will allow me to spread the word, share beautiful music and give you and the people in your life the gift of song. <br/></p>
<p>You are guaranteed at any contribution level to get a digital recording from me upon completion of the mixing/pressing!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact </h3> <p>As a singer, I've always felt a little behind the curve not having a recording to share with people who have asked; it's like being a business with no website! This recording will change that. I can submit with this CD to clubs, venues, festivals, agents and managers. I also really care deeply about the legacy of being an artist and leaving something behind to share with the world; but mostly with family, friends and fans that have supported me and asked for this to happen.</p>
<p>UPDATE: This October I will be joining Princess Cruise Lines for a short Pacific contract where I'm the principal female vocalist. In addition to their wonderful shows, I get to do short sets of music of my own choosing! Those songs are represented here and this CD will be available for sale in the gift shop onboard!

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Shurùq, Scirocco, Xaroco, Σορόκος, Eisseroc… the program
takes its name from a wind originating in the Sahara that then blows northwards
across the Mediterranean.  During the
years of Arab domination in Spain and Southern Italy, culture, ideas and
knowledge followed the same path, so that during the Middle Ages, the Arab
influence on music, painting, architecture, and even cooking was found all
across Europe’s Southern Coast.  And
indeed, many of the instruments we see in the frescoes, miniatures and
sculptors from medieval Spain and Italy are Arab ones, almost identical to
those played today in the North African and Middle Eastern tradition.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In 2013, we gave a Master Class
in Palestine that brought us into contact with two exceptionally talented
young musicians  then in their final year of study at the Edward Saïd
Conservatory.  The next Spring, Osama and
Muhammed followed the Scirocco’s path – this time by EasyJet – for a six-month
residency at the Early Music Department of the Conservatory of Geneva, and a collaboration with Lucidarium.  The goal
was an exchange centered on modal music – both medieval and Middle Eastern.  There
was analysis and discussion, but most of all we played, improvised and
experimented.  The kind of
experimentation where differences in geographical origin or cultural background
seem to disappear by the simple act of sitting down and making music together.</p>

texts, and dances across Europe and beyond are one of the group’s hallmarks.  Projects include ""Hombres de Maiz,"" a program celebrating the links between the Northern Italian and the Northern Mexican musical traditions, ""Con l'Arte e con l'Inganno - the Musical Roots of the Commedia dell'Arte"" and a series of programs dedicated to the music of the Jews in Renaissance Europe. 
Lucidarium has recorded six
award-winning CDs, and receives funding from foundations such as Pro Helvetia,
the European Association for Jewish Culture, and the Canton of Geneva.  It plays regularly in the most important
European (Resonanzen, Regensburg, Holland Early Music Festival/Network, York
Early Music Festival, Royaumont Foundation etc.) and North American (Boston,
Seattle, Houston, Pittsburgh, Toronto) Early Music Festivals, making frequent
“crossovers” into Jewish and World music festivals: Weimar, Budapest, Berkeley
and more...
Selected Reviews

“unaffected, poetic and fresh”
(Thüringer Allgemeine)
“vibrant and robust” (Early Music
America)
“… in Ensemble Lucidarium’s
interpretation, the music did not seem at all ‘historical:’ relaxed and
lustfully played, it seemed as fresh as on the first day” (BLZ Basel)
 “The whole group works like a
perfectly-oiled machine, where everyone knows exactly what to do, changing
improvisational style from piece to piece with an expertise that left the
public astounded and delighted.” (Messaggero Veneto)
 “music that leapt effortlessly
across the centuries” (The Whole Note, Toronto)

At the same time the election was underway and the idea of the ""American Dream"" kept coming up in the news. </p><p>I'm not sure when exactly or why but it seemed like it would make sense to get people to write down what their own ""<i>American Dream</i>"" was. It's something that is always referenced and there is a vague idea of what it means, but I began to wonder what people really thought about it - in their own words.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444000737/nenxx0bvfqgvazlmzw9f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444001202/grpap8s9u7vzmdonrr0g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>What unfolded was unexpected and amazing. People just didn't write trivial things but really heartfelt and personal thoughts and stories. </p><p>Life kinda got in the way for awhile, health, having a kid, etc. and so I had to put things on the shelf for a few years - but I was always still aware that this is a really special project and important to continue. </p><p>So, about a year ago I began making more portraits and getting people to share their stories.

Please feel free to contact directly at ianbrownphoto@gmail.com for details. The project is still in the process of being photographed and will continue to be worked on throughout 2016. We have a new website launch in July 2016.....Hi - My name is Ian Brown.I live in Toronto, am a single dad to a 5 year old girl and I've been a documentary and portrait photographer for almost 20 years. In 2007 I was in the U.S taking portraits of American's and through the conversations that happen the theme of ""being American"" kept coming up with people. At the same time the election was underway and the idea of the ""American Dream"" kept coming up in the news. I'm not sure when exactly or why but it seemed like it would make sense to get people to write down what their own ""American Dream"" was. It's something that is always referenced and there is a vague idea of what it means, but I began to wonder what people really thought about it - in their own words.  What unfolded was unexpected and amazing. People just didn't write trivial things but really heartfelt and personal thoughts and stories. Life kinda got in the way for awhile, health, having a kid, etc. and so I had to put things on the shelf for a few years - but I was always still aware that this is a really special project and important to continue. So, about a year ago I began making more portraits and getting people to share their stories. It meant lots of driving, sleeping in cars, going into sometimes sketchy situations and trying to convince everyday people that they have stories to share also.  It's not easy to do -  It's ambitious and a bit epic in nature. It takes time and research and a commitment - not just on my part, but on the part of the people being photographed and adding their voice. This is not anonymous.What I think makes this project different and special is that It's people from all facets of society - ordinary people who have extraordinary tales and extraordinary people who have simple aspirations - just like you and me. 
I always believe that a good portrait only happens when you invest some time and realize it has to be enriching for everyone involved. As a result people have really resonated with this and are not only willing to be part of this project but often are revealing thoughts and feelings that they have never shared before. The results are profound, beautiful, heartbreaking, funny, sometimes devastating and always intimate and revealing. As unique and individual as the people themselves. 
This is an important time in the history of the US. There are lots of issues and with the upcoming election the country is at a crossroads. The AMERICAN DREAMS PROJECT sets out to capture the stories of individual Americans, in their own words by their own hand. I've done this all on my own up until this point.  Now I'm asking for some help. I'm hoping to raise funds to complete the production of the project. The goal is to finish the project by summer 2016.The finished project will be published into a large format book with each portrait displayed with the adjacent handwritten ""American Dream"" . There will be an accompanying National exhibition of the photos and there is hope that it would then be housed in a permanent collection or public archive. Once in awhile something comes along that becomes greater than the sum of it's parts. A legacy project that composes a true sense of where we are and who we are. Timely and also timeless. The American Dreams Project  aims to become just that. I'm hoping that you can help in whatever way you can. There are some cool incentives if you can contribute to the campaign. Otherwise feel free to share the project to your network and your friends. Everyone has a story to tell. This project is hoping to let people do that. Thanks so much!Ian",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><u><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></u></p>
<p>This is an adventure for me and my first time crowd funding. I am the son of a musician, Hans Lewitus, and am working towards producing a CD in honor of my father that compiles 61 of his songs performed by 3 Boston-based musicians.  Each song is unique and is representative of folk music from various Latin American countries such as <strong>Peru</strong>, <strong>Mexico, Venezuela</strong>, <strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>Nicaragua</strong>, <strong>Uruguay</strong>, <strong>Bolivia, Panama, Ecuador</strong>, <strong>Chile</strong>, <strong>Costa Rica, Cuba, Haiti and Argentina</strong>.  All of the songs are performed on <strong>recorders</strong>,<strong> </strong>which was one of my father's favorite instruments.   My ultimate goal would be to submit this album to the Grammy's for a chance to see it win the Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album!  No goal is to big for me.   </p>
<p><u><strong>FUNDING</strong></u></p>
<p>The funding will go to the production, engineering and distribution of the CDs.  I have been able to use some of my personal savings to get the recordings underway and now I am looking for passionate music lovers to help finish the production of the CDs themselves.   Here is a sneak peek at the recording session.  It's worth a look!  <a href=""https://youtu.be/ThMthWOGCzw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/ThMthWOGCzw</a></p>

<p>The recorder is a woodwind musical instrument in the group known as internal duct flutes—flutes with a whistle mouthpiece.</p>
<p>Recorders are made in different sizes with compasses corresponding to different vocal ranges. The sizes most commonly in use today are the soprano (lowest note C5), alto (lowest note F4), tenor (lowest note C4) and bass (lowest note F3). Recorders are traditionally constructed from wood and ivory, although the use of plastics is now common. The recorder is first documented in the Middle Ages, and continued to enjoy wide popularity in the renaissance and baroque periods, but was little used in the classical and romantic periods. It was revived in the 20th century as part of the historically informed performance movement, and became a popular amateur and educational instrument.</p>
<p><strong><u>ABOUT MY FATHER: </u></strong></p>

<p>In 1936, Professor Lewitus was recruited by the renowned violinist Bronislaw Huberman to become one of the founding members of the Palestine Symphony Orchestra.

<p>He spent the rest of his life in Lima, where, in addition to his position with the National Symphony Orchestra of Peru he was appointed as professor of clarinet at the National Conservatory of Music in Lima.  Professor Lewitus’ distinguished musical career included traveling to Caracas with Chabuca Granda, a beloved Peruvian folk composer and singer, as the director of her orchestra for the Festival de las Canciones. He also composed a mazurka and directed the music for her work ""La Limeñísima.”  The theater director Ricardo Roca Rey asked him to compose incidental music for the production of Shakespeare’s “A Comedy of Errors,” and Professor Lewitus also composed the incidental music for  “Crossing  Niagara,” an acclaimed work by the Peruvian playwright and  director, Alonso Alegria.  Over the years he accompanied many international soloists on the piano.</p>
<p>Upon his retirement from the National Symphony Orchestra, Professor Lewitus began playing recorder and devoted himself to teaching privately piano, clarinet, and recorder. He also arranged Geistliche Lieder (sacred songs) of J.S.

In 2009, I published Lima Romantica and Oda a Chabuca, music written for piano.</p>
<p>Professor Lewitus died in Lima, Peru on September 3, 1998.</p>
