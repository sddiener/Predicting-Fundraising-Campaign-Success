<h3>Help a Bastard Get to Edinburgh.</h3>
<p>Hey, fans!  Red Bastard need your help! Please like and repost this campaign!</p>
<p>Something is happening with Red Bastard that I never expected.  Something that I think is unique in theatre and VERY unique for a comedy show.</p>
<p><strong>It has become an award-winning show that is <em>literally</em> changing people's lives. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Winner:  Best in Theatre</li>
<li>Winner:  Best in Fest</li>
<li>Winner:  Most Outrageous Show</li>
<li>Winner:  Community Commitment Award</li>
<li>Winner:  Best Solo Performance</li>
</ul>
<p>I've spoken to people who have quit their miserable jobs after seeing the show who went on to start their own careers!  Someone made a marriage proposal, just last week.  A man reunited with his estranged sister whom he hadn't spoken to for 8 years.  All of these things took place <em><strong>at the show</strong></em>, <em><strong>in front</strong></em> <strong><em>of the audience</em></strong>.  We can only imagine what might have happened in private after the show.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is a show where <strong><em>real</em></strong> things happen.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Really <em>amazing</em> things,  really <em>scary</em> things, and really <em>funny</em> things.  It's a very special show and Edinburgh is a great opportunity to put this show in fron of European and American Producers.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Please help me do that. </strong></p>

<p>My goal for the festival, will simple be to work my ass off, break even and put the show in front of European and American Producers who will help me to build an international Red Bastard Tour.  </p>
<p>Here are examples of costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$4000 Housing</strong>- 2 BR Flat in Edinburgh (myself and David Berga, who will meeting wtih producers and attempting to make bookings for the show)</li>
<li>
<strong>$3500  Publicist</strong>  (Impressive PR.  They've secured a feature with the Scotsman, which is a huge coup!)</li>
<li>
<strong>$2300</strong> Flights</li>
<li>
<strong>$3050 Ad</strong> in the Fringe Guide, And Foamex large posters</li>
<li>
<strong>$1080</strong>  15,000 flyers and 300 posters.</li>
<li>
<strong>$450</strong> Edinburgh Fringe Entry Fee</li>
<li>
<strong>$2290</strong>  flyering Team to flyer potential audiences at the festival.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For a small company, receiving national recognition is a dream come true! Getting there is the harder part. This is the 35th anniversary of Ballet Theatre of Maryland and 10th anniversary season for the artistic director, Dianna Cuatto. As a local company, our mission is to enrich our community through art and ballet in particular. We are a non-profit organization and most of our dancers devote their time for little to no monetary compensation. It is a struggle to stay afloat when many Marylanders do not even know we exist. In order to afford living expenses, most of our dancers work second jobs. Whether that be waiting tables, retail, teaching dance, or tutoring, money and time is tight. On top of living expenses, dancers have other non-negotiable expenses, the largest one perhaps being pointe shoes. A dancer can spend up to $3000.00 on pointe shoes per year. At a larger company those expenses are covered but at a smaller company like BTM, dancers receive only a small stipend per show toward their shoes. Hence developed our project!</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise money for a pointe shoe fund that would allow all our dancers to consistently dance on good, safe shoes for the 2013-2014 season. This would greatly improve the quality of our rehearsal time and it would be energizing and motivating to see BTM be capable of providing such an advantage to its dancers. Good shoes are a huge asset to ensuring the longevity of our bodies and thus the longevity of BTM as a reputable ballet company! Not to mention, we cannot put on our many creative mainstage performances without them!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal of $15,000 would be an amazing beginning to an ever growing fund to keep all of our dancers - <strong>full company members, apprentices, and trainee 3's</strong> - in pointe shoes all season long. In return for any contribution, small or large, Ballet Theatre of Maryland will show appreciation by thanking donors with a unique reward! Donors are not purchasing these items rather being acknowledged with a gift for their generosity. All donations are tax deductible and rewards will be distributed at the completion of the 60 day campaign!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The best way to express the positive impact and great value of having a fully functioning professional company in Annapolis is through a quote by the Artistic Director herself:</p>
<p>""Our professional company aims to inspire our audience through the transforming power of American dance. Energy, athleticism, dynamism and passion are classic American dance ideals that move our dancers to achieve higher levels of artistry and skill, whether through the drama of contemporary pieces or by making classic ballet storytelling come to life.</p>
<p>Our school of Classical and Contemporary Dance is the only school in Maryland that offers a fully comprehensive ballet training program for the beginner student up to the professional dancer. Our focus on the healthy body aesthetic, healthy body types, and healthy mentoring is a hallmark of our school and company.</p>
<p>In my tenth season as Ballet Theatre of Maryland’s Artistic Director, I'm looking forward to continuing to produce high-caliber ballet performances that engage the mind and spirit and express Maryland’s unique voice through movement. My goal is to make ballet accessible to all while attaining ever higher levels of artistic excellence.""</p>
<p>-Dianna Cuatto</p>
<p>It's not always easy to find consistent support in such a small town but we are growing every year. While the company's budget cannot yet provide the dancers with the shoes that needed to keep bringing our art to the community, we are hoping that taking this proactive approach will serve as the impetus to that next step!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone will be able to contribute and that is okay! Do you know anybody near or far that might be interested in our cause? Help us find people that might be interested in contributing - ask folks to get the word out!  ""Indiegogo"" has some great share tools to help make some noise about our campaign.</p>

<p>So, one day I was sitting in my apartment, once again, thinking about this play I've always dreamt of doing called <em>The Baby Dance</em> by Jane Anderson. It's a piece that's such a slice of heaven for actors...beautiful writing and a good, old rollercoaster of emotions that are blended with wonderful humor to boot. And, for the audience, it's a beautiful night of theater so it's a big win-win all around.</p>
<p>Then, it hit me that I actually could do it if I got the rights. So, I applied and, low and behold, I got 'em - so a huge YAY to that! Now, I'm writing you to ask for your support to get ""The Baby Dance"" from my wishlist to the stage.</p>
<h3>Does a baby really dance in the play? Because that would be awesome.</h3>
<p>No, but good question, my friend. It does, however, have many other levels of awesomeness. <em>The Baby Dance</em> is a beautifully, written piece about an L.A. couple who want to have children but can’t. Out of their desperation, they arrange to buy an unborn child from a dirt-poor Southern couple. The play also has so much to say about families, poverty and disparity between the classes.</p>
<p>Plus, being a good Southerner, I was particularly drawn to the poor couple. Initially, the audience thinks ‘Oh, I know who they are. They’re poor dumb, Southerners,” but as the play progresses, they realize they are far from that characterization. It’s just a beautifully written piece that really touches audiences and deserves to be produced again.</p>
<h3>What you'll get by donating to <em>The Baby Dance</em> or, a.k.a., good Karma goes a long way.</h3>
<p><em>The Baby Dance</em> will have a six-week run from March 1<sup>st</sup> to April 14th on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. The fundraising goal is $9,500 that would cover all production costs from theater rental to rehearsal space and from director and designer fees to publicity. Every dollar donated would be spent on the production and every dollar dollar is so appreciated! Please check out the perks that are listed for you!</p>
<p>Also, please feel free to share this with folks you know who love good theater, love giving away moolah or just love helpin a gal out. Seriously, please feel free :)</p></div>","What's up with the baby?""

<div>Why are we asking?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are asking for money because we just won a spot at the global finals of ""Destination Imagination"", (you can look it up at <a href=""http://www.globalfinals.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.globalfinals.org</a>) but we go to a public school in downtown Toronto, and the finals are in Tennessee.

We are asking for money because we just won a spot at the global finals of ""Destination Imagination"", (you can look it up at http://www.globalfinals.org) but we go to a public school in downtown Toronto, and the finals are in Tennessee. Most of the schools going to finals are private and have access to funds that we don't have. Luckily  an anonymous donor has payed for most of our costs, but we still need a bit more. 
Please, we really want to compete and this would be an amazing experience for us.

guys! Thanks for visiting out page! Our names are Alex Madda and Madeline
Sharton, and we have both written one-woman shows that have been accepted to
the United Solo Theatre Festival at Theatre Row in New York City in Fall 2014.
We are so excited to be showcasing our respective shows at United Solo on 42nd
Street in the next few months! Alex's show <i>Prom Queen by Default</i> debuted
in January 2014, and Madeline's <i>Power Play </i>in May 2013. We are
both graduates from the University of Michigan Department of Theatre &amp;
Drama, and after our successful trial runs at UofM, we are so excited to be
making our Off-Broadway debuts in our original one-woman shows!</b></p>

and times of Alex Madda and her kooky college and high school career, seen
through the magic of song and beginners’ dance. Audiences will sit on the train

insecurities, and the search for the most convenient post-college entry-level
job.</p><div>

<p>Hi everyone!
What's going on? I’m Chase Smith and for the past 5 years I've been the Student
Pastor and Worship Leader at Trinity Church in Salisbury, NC. God has blessed
the time my wife and I have served there and is now starting us out on a new
adventure!</p>
<p>In March, I
received an invitation to attend a nationwide talent showcase in Orlando, FL
through the Christian talent agency AMTC – Actors Models and Talents for
Christ. AMTC is a non-profit, 501©(3) Christian ministry that’s been around for
over 30 years.</p>
<p>This week long
event in December will put me in front of hundreds of Hollywood agents and
record label executives. They’ve launched thousands of careers and this is
an INCREDIBLE opportunity to impact the world and further the Kingdom of God.
But I need your help. I am trying to raise money to help pay for my trip. I
need to raise $6,645 to cover my expenses, registration, professional training
intensive weekends (professional talent training sessions with voice and acting
coaches, and a professional photo shoot) round trip plane tickets, showcase
auditions, and hotel reservations. </p>
<p>I would like to
model this support process after what Paul had to say in Philippians 4:10-19.
In these verses, Paul is thanking the saints in Philippi for their aid while he
was traveling to Macedonia and Thessalonica. Verse 17 says, “Not that I am
looking for a gift, but I am looking for what may be credited to your account.”</p>
<p>Do not look at
this as simply a gift, but yet an opportunity to invest in a ministry of God’s
work. Let's be a part of God’s plan together! This decision you are going to
make in one that you will be rewarded for in heaven. I don't want you to miss
out!</p><br/><br/><p></p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>How did you come up with $6,645?</h3><p>Here is my campaign broken down in detail:</p><p><br/></p><p>

</h3>“In Colour” is a dance show exploring the possible personalities of red, yellow, and blue. In this stage production brought to life with an original score, the dancers tell the story of these contrasting shades. Works of visual art will be specially created by a local artist (Jude Dixon) for the event and sold in the lobby, creating a truly unified artistic experience. Performers include head choreographer/producer Rebecca Karpus, Amanda Gillies, and Megan Wainman, alongside the music of Lindsay Warnock. Performed at the Evergreen Cultural Centre in Coquitlam Friday August 29th at 8:00pm, “In Colour” will be a curious, compelling and colourful piece of art. Tickets are $15 and can be purchased at <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/in-colour-tickets-10863401727"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/in-colour-tickets-10863401727</a><div>
<br/><p><b> Did you read somewhere that ""In Colour"" would be performed at a different venue than what is stated above?</b> Recently our venue has changed to the Evergreen Cultural Centre in Coquitlam. Same time, same date, but different venue. Our apologies. </p>
<p>I'm Rebecca Karpus, the producer, creator, and head choreographer of summer 2014’s “In Colour”. I grew up on the West Coast and began dancing at a young age, much like two of my good friends, Amanda Gillies and Megan Wainman. Truth be told, the three of us grew up together in the same dance schools, summer programs, competitions, and companies. In fact, Amanda and I are first cousins. These three ladies are the cast of “In Colour”.</p>
<br/>  All of us are all extremely passionate about dance, leading us to careers in the field including the School of Alberta Ballet (Megan), Coastal City Ballet (Amanda), and Ryerson University, BFA: Dance (myself). However, dancing professionally is a very hard thing to do between frequently relocating one’s life on the drop of a hat, countless auditions, and chronic injuries. In the midst of a chaotic career as a dancer, it can be easy to lose sight of what one has right in front of them- good friends with good ideas. Therefore, once the three of us finally ended up in the same city at the same time, I grabbed the chance to pool our talent, our strengths, and our love for dance, to create something that we can call our own. After innumerable shows as a dancer in a company or in a school, we now have our opportunity to dance in our own entity that we call “In Colour”. This production is 100% for the passion of choreography, dance, and artistic vision. Ever since I was 14, “Create my own dance show” was on my lifelong bucket list. So here I am today, choreographing “In Colour” with these two remarkable ladies, and wanting to share our final product with you.<br/><p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>  We are hoping to raise $550 for this production. This money would go directly to costumes, the rental dance floor, props and small set pieces, the venue fee, promotional materials (posters, programs, etc.), and paying those involved in the show (primarily the performers and the composer).<br/><br/>  Be excited because we are offering some unique perks! If you contribute $50 (Package A), you will receive two complimentary tickets and a poster signed by the cast and the composer. If you contribute $100 (Package B), you will receive two complimentary tickets plus a free hour and a half dance class for you and/or a loved one, taught by one or more of the cast members. We are distributing ten Package A’s, and two Package B’s.<br/><p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>  Support from you would impact so many young and diverse artists. Between three dancers, a visual artist, a composer, a graphic designer, a videographer, a production manager/lighting designer, and many more, we are a versatile crew of youthful and passionate artists. Offering us the finances to create this multifaceted piece would allow this artistic community to develop not only for our benefit, but also for our growing audience base.<br/><br/>  Your contribution would be greatly valued because it would show us that we are capable of creating work without the direct support of a large company/institution. Knowing that you support independent dance projects gives us the confidence to continue working within this structure, which we so enjoy. Your support impacts every artist involved in the piece, showing us that small productions are more than possible, creating a growing appreciation for the arts. We would deeply appreciate your contribution to help make our dreams become a reality—for the joy of dance, old friendships, and art.<br/><p></p> <p> </p>
<p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>  Not in the financial position to contribute but still would like to help out? Thank you! You can help us by spreading the word on “In Colour”. Tell your friends and family about it and use social media (Facebook, Twitter, and so forth) to publicize the event. Having a full house would be the most incredible experience for us, so the more who know about it, the better! Make sure to pass along the date, location, and time, as well as the ticket information. As well, we always require volunteers. If you are free on the performance night and would like to give us a hand, give us a shout! More importantly though, please attend “In Colour”, if you can. The biggest gift is an interested audience, eager to enjoy original dance and music.<br/><br/><h3>About Me<br/>
</h3>Rebecca Karpus is a dancer, dance instructor, choreographer, and graduate student at Simon Fraser University. She received her training at several Canadian dance institutions including Arts Umbrella, Pacific Dance Arts, and L’Ecole superieure de ballet du Quebec. After graduating from high school (through half day programs that allowed her more time to train) she attended the BFA: Dance Performance program at Ryerson University in Toronto. After three years of the program, Rebecca decided to complete her degree as a Bachelor of Performing Arts at Capilano University. Rebecca has taught at numerous lower mainland studios including The danceLAB, the Pro Arte Centre, and Adagio Rhythmic Academy. In September she will be starting her MA in Comparative Media Arts, specializing in dance history. Rebecca aspires to become a dance scholar/historian while continuing to teach, choreograph, and produce.  <br/><br/>

<p>""I have measured out my life with coffee spoons."" <i>-</i>T.S. Eliot<i>, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</i></p>
<p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>CoffeeSpoons Theatre Project is a collective of passionate individuals who seek to put on free theatre that is accessible and inviting to anyone and everyone. The brainchild and obsession of Shanti Gonzales, raised in Dedham MA and theatre student at McGill University in Montréal, the Project returns for its second summer. </p>
<p>There are those who see theatre as stale words, a stiff-backed chair, and a stuffy windowless room--we here at CoffeeSpoons hope to change that. We strive to breathe youthful and inspired life into the theatre, bringing comedic one-acts into a casual café setting. With CoffeeSpoons, ""a night at the theatre"" involves food, friends, drinks, and laughter. </p>
<p>Our first production, selections from David Ives's <i>All in the Timing</i>, premièred in August 2013 at Paradise Café in Dedham. We were just a bunch of kids who loved the theatre enough to try and make something out of nothing. We were amazed to find our exhaustion and exhilaration rewarded by packed houses both nights. </p>
<p>This year, CoffeeSpoons is again stirring up something exciting. We will be back at Paradise Café August 20-23, 2014 with three of Shel Silverstein's comedic one-acts from the collection <i>An Adult Evening with Shel Silverstein</i>. (Yup, he wrote plays too!) We also have many other surprises brewing here at CoffeeSpoons, but we need your help.</p>
<p>CoffeeSpoons is hoping to be bigger and bolder than ever this summer. Last year, we scraped by on Shanti's barista paycheck, with our costs eventually offset by generous audience donations. However, CoffeeSpoons's growth requires more. Please donate to our cause and help us continue to stir up an informal theatre experience like never before. </p>
<p><b>Where is the money going?</b></p>
<p>Your donations will help us pay for all the things that make our show possible: from performance rights to props to costumes to manpower to publicity and much more. Every penny counts! Even if we don't reach our goal we will still be able to use these funds to make our Project bigger and bolder than ever before. If we do reach/surpass our goal, a portion of the funds will be reinvested in the Project to ensure that we keep coming back to serve our community. </p>

<p>The Last Five Years by Jason Robert Brown is an emotionally moving story of two young New Yorkers who fall in and out of love over the course of 5 years.  The twist? Their story is told twice: Jamie, the man, tells his story chronologically however Cathy, the woman, tells her story in reverse chronological order.  The two only meet once during the wedding in the middle of the story.  The result is a bittersweet juxtaposition of love and loss, beautifully told through Jason Robert Brown’s music and lyrics.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What Is The Plan?</h3>
<p>The venue for our production will be the Stack Theatre at the Cork School of Music, with four performance dates from July 24<sup>th</sup> to July 27<sup>th</sup>.  The artistic team, including Tom Doyle as Musical Director, has been assembled.  All we need now is the means to bring our vision to life.  That’s where you come in.</p>

<h3>How Can You Help?</h3>
<p>Scruffy Duck Productions has hundreds of shows worth of experience; however, we need your help to make this production a reality.  Our team has already raised 50% of our production costs through company investment.  We hope to raise the remaining  €1000 through your generosity and support.  Your investment will go towards venue rental, show rights, costumes, set, music, and generally making our production as wonderful as possible.  We hope you will consider supporting the arts in Cork and bring our production to life.</p>

<p>My name is Kalin Mitov and I am the director of this event.</p>
<p>I would like to invite you to participate in a unique fundraising opportunity. In partnership with Boston Dance Alliance ( non-profit 501 c 3) and North American Same-Sex Partner Dance Association we are organizing the 2014 North American Same-Sex Ballroom Dance Championship. </p>
<p>Тhe Championship is not only a ballroom dance competition, but also a public declaration of the need for equality at all levels of our lives. It supports the diversity and acceptance of the youth and adult LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>The 2014 North American Same Sex Ballroom Dance Championship is a one-day competitive event highlighting the grace and skills of the ballroom dance contestants, and also includes social ballroom dancing and professional dance performances. It  features  disciplines like Argentine Tango, Salsa, Hustle, Country Western Polka, Two Step and West Coast Swing as well as the traditional Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot, Cha-cha Rumba, Jive  and more…(full list can be found on the website)</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">This event will benefit the general population- 18 years old and above; man, woman and transgender. It is open to everybody supporting the LGBTQ community. One of the main goals is to introduce ballroom dancing as a safe environment and an alternative pro-social event for the young LGBTQ. Such an event teaches them about partnership, understanding, tolerance, and responsibility not only on the dance floor but in life.</span><br/></p>
<p>We are expecting 200 competitors from Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver Canada, New York, Connecticut, Rode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Philadelphia, Florida, Maryland, Washington DC, California and many other states. The venue can host 500 spectators and most of them will be from Greater Boston and New England,  along with friends and supporters of the competitive couples.</p>

The Official are: Adjudicator’s panel with a Chairman and 8 well known NASSPDA approved judges; Scrutinizing team of 2; Master of Ceremony; Audio and video technician with a DJ; Registration desk personnel and On Deck Captain. These functions are performed either by volunteers or trained personnel who accept less then their market value to help make us a success. The North America Same Sex Partner Dance Association will supervise the event with Benjamin Soenckson as  Chairman, and Barbara Zoloth (President of NASSPDA).

<p>The primary costs are associated with the venue including associated lighting and audio visual equipment. But there is also a need to make people aware of the event, to attract attendees and competitors, and the advertising necessary to reach those audiences is quite costly.</p>
<p>Our revenue has not allowed us to compensate our judges at  market rates and we have not been able to reward the winners financially, as other competitions of this type do.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Hoopdrum is our performing arts company specializing in hoop
dance and percussion, based in Carrboro, NC.<span style="""">  </span>If you live in the Triangle, you may have caught Julia’s
whirling trance spinning to Scott's drum beats.<span style=""""></span><span style="""">  </span>Through our work, we strive to inspire and nurture our expansive, collaborative community.<span style="""">  </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""""></span>Hoop dance, music and other flow &amp; circus arts share a
common challenge of acquiring adequate space for advancement and sharing of
skills.<span style="""">  </span>After five years of working independently and five years performing together, we have taken a leap of faith to open a spacious &amp; innovative
studio for practice, teaching, performance and community events.<span style="""">  </span>With 25’ ceilings and 1,000 sq ft dance
space, The Flowjo will beautifully meet the need of any movement artist.<span style="""">  </span><span style=""""> </span>This music &amp; movement sanctuary, one of the first primarily-hoop studios in the world, will
open in February of 2011.  <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times;""></span><p class=""MsoNormal"">
</p>
<h2 class=""MsoNormal"">The Impact</h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The
Flowjo will have an emphasis on hoop dance, but will also host regular aerial dance classes, as well as an array of circus,
acrobatic, dance and flow arts workshops and camps for all ages.<span style="""">  </span>For locals, this studio will offer
a unique, fun, healthy, challenging curriculum unavailable on a regular basis for individuals 4 – adult.<span style="""">  <br/></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br/><span style=""""></span><span style=""""></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We believe The Flowjo will enhance the community by catering to different movement and learning styles. There will
be opportunities for traditional instruction available, as well as abundant opportunity for self- directed,
meditative and communal practice space.   Julia aspires to start a Youth Circus, co-create monthly performance
events, community outreach programs and provide scholarships to summer camps
and classes.  You can help make these visions become a reality.   <br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The good news:<span style=""""> 
</span>The Flowjo will open.<span style=""""></span><span style="""">  </span>However, there are a lot of projects left to complete.  Without help, some projects may be delayed, decreasing income streams that could be necessary to sustain the space.<span style=""""></span><span style=""""></span>  Due to a 
hefty overhead (downtown rent, utilities and insurance), additional business loans may prevent us from meeting our expenses, especially in the beginning.  We would prefer to support more progressive outreach programs with our income rather than meet high interest loans or credit payments.<span style="""">   We</span> are eager to continue devoting our sweat equity,
capital and wedding gifts (thank you!) to the beautification and success of The Flowjo.<span style="""">  </span>If we can avoid getting deep in personal debt, we will be able to more effectively operate &amp; maintain this space for our community near &amp; far.<br/></p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>
<h2 class=""MsoNormal"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Flowjo project would like to raise <span style=""font-style: italic;"">at least</span> $8008 to
re-create this warehouse shell into a respectable, inspiring sanctuary.<span style="""">  </span>The flooring is purchased, but a subfloor is necessary to
protect dancing bodies from the concrete slab base.<span style=""""> 
</span>The landlord installed a sprinkler system, bathrooms, emergency exit and
water fountains to bring the space up to code, but there’s much more work ahead.<span style="""">  </span>We have invested
$8000 and countless hours thus far for the commercial lease, rent, aerials rigs, PA equipment,
permits, sign, flooring, tools, website and management software.<span style=""""> 
</span>We are prepared to invest another $6000 and unlimited hours to the launch and success of this project.<span style="""">  </span>Unfortunately, that won’t quite cover
what is left to purchase and will leave us with little cushion for unforeseeable costs in the first months.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Here's some of what we need:<span style="""">  </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sprung floor system (and labor<span style=""font-family: Wingdings;""><span style=""""></span></span>)</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Lumber for a small stage to house and protect instruments <br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Gymnastics mats<span style=""""> 
</span>(4) </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Crash pad for aerial (1) </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Acoustic insulation materials (wood, fiber, fabric, labor) </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Paint (graffiti outside…while we appreciate the art, we would like to start
fresh:) <br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Low VOC paint for indoors (want to make it as green as
possible)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Theater curtain fabric to provide privacy, energy &amp; sound insulation <br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Mirrors &amp; installation<br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Materials to build two long benches w/ cubbies underneath &amp; labor<br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Water filtration or dispensing system for public drinking (water fountains
meet code… barely)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Insurance</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">LED lighting <br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Rugs for stretch/lounge space</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Yoga mats</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Blankets</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Desk &amp; office supplies</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""""> </span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">All this will cost well over $11,000 but we've tried to make our goal here as manageable as possible. <span style=""""></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The more refined The Flowjo is upfront, the more likely that
costs of running the facility will be met and that all of the teachers using
the space could feel sustained as well.  FYI, any contributions made will be available immediately for us to use in up-fitting this space.<br/></p>
<br/><h2 class=""MsoNormal"">What you get!</h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Aside from endless gratitude and dancing prayers, The Perks include educational offerings for the complete beginner to those focusing on hoop dance professionally.  Please peruse the complete Perks packages to the right.  <br/></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times;"">Please keep in mind that if you do not live in the
Triangle area, or hoop &amp; drum classes just aren’t for you, we
pledge to provide the instruction perks you would receive to someone who could
not otherwise afford these opportunities.<span style=""""> 
</span>The Flowjo is located in a low income area where many would benefit from financial assistance for these programs.  Passing on your Perk would provide a great scholarship package!  If you choose to pay your benefit forward, we would gladly document who receives the instruction and send out videos from the student exhibitions.</span><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Custom hoops and stickers can be mailed around the globe.<br/><span style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times;""></span></p><p>Hoop Convergence information can be found at <a href=""http://www.hoopconvergence.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.hoopconvergence.org</a>. </p><p>Class descriptions will be available this week on <a href=""http://www.TheFlowjo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.TheFlowjo.com</a>.<br/></p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><br/><h2 class=""MsoNormal"">Other Ways You Can Help</h2>

<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p></div>","Our Story 
Hoopdrum is our performing arts company specializing in hoop
dance and percussion, based in Carrboro, NC.  If you live in the Triangle, you may have caught Julia’s
whirling trance spinning to Scott's drum beats.  Through our work, we strive to inspire and nurture our expansive, collaborative community.  
 
Hoop dance, music and other flow & circus arts share a
common challenge of acquiring adequate space for advancement and sharing of
skills.  After five years of working independently and five years performing together, we have taken a leap of faith to open a spacious & innovative
studio for practice, teaching, performance and community events.  With 25’ ceilings and 1,000 sq ft dance
space, The Flowjo will beautifully meet the need of any movement artist.   This music & movement sanctuary, one of the first primarily-hoop studios in the world, will
open in February of 2011.  

The Impact
 
The
Flowjo will have an emphasis on hoop dance, but will also host regular aerial dance classes, as well as an array of circus,
acrobatic, dance and flow arts workshops and camps for all ages.  For locals, this studio will offer
a unique, fun, healthy, challenging curriculum unavailable on a regular basis for individuals 4 – adult.  
We believe The Flowjo will enhance the community by catering to different movement and learning styles. There will
be opportunities for traditional instruction available, as well as abundant opportunity for self- directed,
meditative and communal practice space.   Julia aspires to start a Youth Circus, co-create monthly performance
events, community outreach programs and provide scholarships to summer camps
and classes.  You can help make these visions become a reality.   
 The good news: 
The Flowjo will open.  However, there are a lot of projects left to complete.  Without help, some projects may be delayed, decreasing income streams that could be necessary to sustain the space.  Due to a 
hefty overhead (downtown rent, utilities and insurance), additional business loans may prevent us from meeting our expenses, especially in the beginning.  We would prefer to support more progressive outreach programs with our income rather than meet high interest loans or credit payments.   We are eager to continue devoting our sweat equity,
capital and wedding gifts (thank you!) to the beautification and success of The Flowjo.  If we can avoid getting deep in personal debt, we will be able to more effectively operate & maintain this space for our community near & far.

What We Need & What You Get
 
The Flowjo project would like to raise at least $8008 to
re-create this warehouse shell into a respectable, inspiring sanctuary.  The flooring is purchased, but a subfloor is necessary to
protect dancing bodies from the concrete slab base. 
The landlord installed a sprinkler system, bathrooms, emergency exit and
water fountains to bring the space up to code, but there’s much more work ahead.  We have invested
$8000 and countless hours thus far for the commercial lease, rent, aerials rigs, PA equipment,
permits, sign, flooring, tools, website and management software. 
We are prepared to invest another $6000 and unlimited hours to the launch and success of this project.  Unfortunately, that won’t quite cover
what is left to purchase and will leave us with little cushion for unforeseeable costs in the first months.Here's some of what we need:  
 
Sprung floor system (and labor)Lumber for a small stage to house and protect instruments 
Gymnastics mats 
(4) 
Crash pad for aerial (1) 
Acoustic insulation materials (wood, fiber, fabric, labor) 
Paint (graffiti outside…while we appreciate the art, we would like to start
fresh:) 
Low VOC paint for indoors (want to make it as green as
possible)
Theater curtain fabric to provide privacy, energy & sound insulation 
Mirrors & installation
Materials to build two long benches w/ cubbies underneath & labor
Water filtration or dispensing system for public drinking (water fountains
meet code… barely)
Insurance
LED lighting 
Rugs for stretch/lounge space
Yoga mats
Blankets
Desk & office supplies
 All this will cost well over $11,000 but we've tried to make our goal here as manageable as possible. The more refined The Flowjo is upfront, the more likely that
costs of running the facility will be met and that all of the teachers using
the space could feel sustained as well.  FYI, any contributions made will be available immediately for us to use in up-fitting this space.
What you get!
Aside from endless gratitude and dancing prayers, The Perks include educational offerings for the complete beginner to those focusing on hoop dance professionally.  Please peruse the complete Perks packages to the right.  Please keep in mind that if you do not live in the
Triangle area, or hoop & drum classes just aren’t for you, we
pledge to provide the instruction perks you would receive to someone who could
not otherwise afford these opportunities. 
The Flowjo is located in a low income area where many would benefit from financial assistance for these programs.  Passing on your Perk would provide a great scholarship package!  If you choose to pay your benefit forward, we would gladly document who receives the instruction and send out videos from the student exhibitions.Custom hoops and stickers can be mailed around the globe.Hoop Convergence information can be found at www.hoopconvergence.org. Class descriptions will be available this week on www.TheFlowjo.com.Other Ways You Can Help
Come out to The Flowjo.  Treat your bodymind to a class or attend a jam.  Host your own event or birthday party in the space.  Tell a friend.  Come help out during a beautification
day.  Do you have a skill to
share…do tell!  Share the website www.theflowjo.com and project with
friends.  “Like” hoopdrum on
facebook.  Do you have some
materials sitting around in your barn that would be helpful, sweet!  Re-used materials are preferable!  Send a prayer for collaborative success.  Follow your bliss!  Thank you so much for your time & consideration.Sincerely,Julia, Scott and the entire Flowjo Family",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We, <strong>Anne Fizzard</strong> and <strong>Virginia Roncetti</strong>, are expat Canadians, and members of the Drama Desk-nominated, Innovative Theatre Award-winning <strong>WorkShop Theater Company</strong>, located in the heart of Manhattan. We have a feast of fine plays in store for New York City theatre audiences in January 2013, with a very special reading series.</p>
<h2><strong>UNKNOWN COUNTRY '13: Three Plays from Canada</strong></h2>
<p>You may think cold, snow and ice when you think of Canada, but did you know that, from west to east, <strong>Canada is a hotbed of brilliant and provocative playwrights</strong>? They are, many of them, completely unknown in the U.S., just as much about Canada is unknown to the average American.  This makes no sense for, after all, we speak the same language, and our cultures overlap considerably.</p>
<p>Therefore, the<strong> WorkShop Theater Company</strong>, in association with the <strong>Playwrights Guild of Canada</strong>, plan to knock your socks off from January 24 to 26, 2013 with readings of three Canadian plays of universal appeal, with the series <strong>UNKNOWN COUNTRY: Three Plays from Canada.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>LEAVE OF ABSENCE by Lucia Frangione - January 24, 2013<br/></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Leave of Absence</strong>, by British Columbia playwright Lucia Frangione, tackles issues of sexual identity in teens, bullying, spirituality and today's Catholic church.  Smart, compassionate, funny and sad, this is a play for adults. These are characters who are living out loud. Leave of Absence has won the Amnesty International ACTivist theatre competition.</p>
<h3>OIL AND WATER by Robert Chafe - January 25, 2013</h3>
<p>By Newfoundlander  Robert Chafe, the lyrical <strong>Oil and Water</strong> tells the tale of Lanier Phillips, the only African-American survivor of the wreck of the U.S. Truxton, in 1942, off the shore of tiny St. Lawrence, Newfoundland. Lanier, a child of the Jim Crow South, had never heard a kind word from a white person. The St. Lawrence villagers who rescued and cared for him and the other survivors, had never seen a black person before.  His St. Lawrence experience turns Lanier from an angry young man into a leader in the U.S.civil rights struggle, while remaining forever connected to Newfoundland. Robert's play Afterimage won Canada's 2010 Governor-General's Award for Drama.</p>
<h3>AFTER JERUSALEM by Aaron Bushkowsky - January 26, 2013</h3>
<p>Aaron is another British Columbia playwright, and with <strong>After Jerusalem</strong>, he defies expectations of what a play set in Jerusalem might be about. A down-on-her-luck school teacher travels to Israel to find love, by making herself up to be a famous actress. At a security checkpoint, she meets an Israeli soldier who is a wannabe script-writer with many tall tales to tell. Quirky, extremely funny, and yet very serious, it is clear why <strong>After Jerusalem</strong> was nominated for the prestigious Carol Bolt Award for playwriting, and for a Jesse Richardson Award (Vancouver) for best new script.</p>
<p><strong>These readings will be FREE to the public. The WorkShop has generously provided the venue. The Playwrights Guild of Canada has put many resources at our disposal.</strong></p>
<h3>However, we are turning to you to help us cover these and other expenses:</h3>
<ul>
<li>stipends for the directors and actors</li>
<li>purchases of scripts</li>
<li>rights</li>
<li>printing costs</li>
<li>stationery and supplies (ink cartridges, paper, envelopes)</li>
<li>photocopying</li>
<li>postage</li>
<li>a modest reception to follow the final reading on the 26th of January</li>
</ul>
<p>If we fall short of our target, there will be smaller stipends for the actors and directors, who work so hard, for just a stipend, not a salary. It would also mean  fewer rehearsals, which is undesireable because we want very polished readings. There would be no closing night reception. We are optimistic, though, that with your help, we will reach our target, and make this event very special.</p>
<p>We should point out that the current federal government in Canada ended any funding for the promotion of Canadian artists abroad several years ago. Therefore it is left up to the little guys, a handful of ex-Pat Canadians, to sing the praises in NYC of Canadian playwrights.</p>
<h3><strong>Your Gift  Will Accomplish Much. We KNOW This.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>We know this, because we have seen it work before. We also produced UNKNOWN COUNTRY I and II in 2005 and 2006, respectively. These series' led to packed houses and standing ovations. Most valuable for the playwrights, as a result of the New York readings, their scripts found their way to people who might produce the plays.<br/></strong></p>
<p>Along with the general public, it is important that theatre professionals see these readings, so we make sure we invite these VIPs: artistic directors and literary managers of New York and tri-state theatre companies, as well as producers and directors. When they cannot attend, they frequently ask for copies of the scripts. So, the scripts end up in the best hands. We and the playwrights have created important contacts doing this work. If one of these professionals likes a script, the hope is that it will end up being produced, or that more of the playwrights' scripts will be requested, and one of those scripts will be produced. <strong>It's a matter of painstakingly sowing seeds in an ongoing way.</strong></p>
<p>Lucia, Robert and Aaron are so excited. Ask most Canadian playwrights, no matter how celebrated and award-winning in Canada, if you can do a New York reading of his or her play, and the answer is always a resounding ""yes, please.""</p>
<p>We know that theatre is important to you, and therefore that bringing to light  great plays which are undeservedly under the radar, that hearing new voices is important to you. You will be able to say you saw these first, before their productions Off-Broadway and in regional theatres around the U.S.</p>
Everyone is a winner with this project.
<p><strong>NO DONATION IS TOO SMALL! It doesn't have to be any of the amounts listed with the perks either. Donations under $10 are gratefully received.</strong></p>
<p>If you cannot make a donation, we hope you will <strong>make some noise about our project, and use IndieGoGo's sharing tools to do so.</strong> Thank you so much for reading about UNKNOWN COUNTRY, and for your consideration!</p>

<h3>Gilding the Lily (phase one: taking root)</h3>
<p>I’m currently writing a play about Lillie Langtry, the Gilded Age actress and celebrity who was panned by critics for her portrayal of Rosalind in Shakespeare’s <em>As You Like It</em>.</p>
<p>This is a play about her life, loves and art—about the crafting of a fabulous and mysterious persona. Could Lillie be Lillie the Professional Beauty, the notorious mistress, the brand… and still be an actress who touched people’s hearts? </p>
<p> It’s a story about love, and the things that keep us from it; about art, and the things that keep us from achieving it; about how hard it is to reveal our true selves. So far, like the beauty herself, the story is funny and sad. With your help we’ll find out how it ends (OK, I know how it ends; you’ll just have to see)! The title is “Gilding the Lily,” and it should appeal to romantics, Shakespeare-lovers, aesthetes, and people who just like celebrity gossip. </p>
<p>It’s a play I’m going to perform myself, so for Lillie to take root in me means working deeply both as a writer and an actor. The creation of Lillie was a life-long project for Mrs. Langtry. My creation of Lillie won’t take that long, with your help, but it will involve a transformation of self: from myself to the fictional Lillie I am gilding. The final creation will glitter, and it will not be small. Here are the next steps:</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>So here’s what I need to continue “Gilding the Lily”:</h3>
<p>$1500 to finish researching and writing the script (I need a little more time without a part time job; being an stage actor is already a full time job that doesn’t pay very well.  I have interested producers, but I don’t have a commission for the writing of the script.)</p>
<p>$1200 for Lillie’s specific dialect work this spring with expert voice and dialect teacher Louis Colaianni (<a href=""http://www.louiscolaianni.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.louiscolaianni.com</a>)</p>
<p>$1440 for six months of voice work with Andrea Haring (Linklater voice work is not merely about the production of sound; it is an approach to acting which allows us to work from the deepest, truest part of ourselves.  This work is an essential part of my exploration of Lillie.  <a href=""http://www.thelinklatercenter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thelinklatercenter.com</a>)</p>
<p>$800 for workshop sessions in NYC - director honorariums and space rental (several playwrights and directors are generously donating their time to the development of the script, but this is simply not possible for some of the artists that I need to work with)</p>
<p>$250 for travel and housing for workshop(s) at Shakespeare &amp; Company (Lillie’s thoughts are full of Shakespeare’s stories and language, so I will return to the home of my own Shakespearean training to work with artists who have generously offered to critique the script.)</p>
<p>$622 Indiegogo fees and credit card processing fees</p>
<p>$5,812  Total Goal</p>
<p>This amount covers most but not all of the costs for this phase of the project.  For example it does not include any writing, resources or research used until now or any local transportation costs.  Any amount raised over this goal will be gratefully reserved for the next phase of this project.</p>
<h3>About the Playwright / Performer</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is Susannah's first play she has written for production. As a dramaturg, literary assistant, and actor for plays in development she has worked at Trinity Rep, Alias Stage, New Dramatists, LaMama ETC, HERE, New Georges, and the NY International Fringe Festival. She directed and helped develop the first production of Hayley Finn’s one-woman show <em>Hysteria: Silence in Stills</em> at the NY Fringe Festival.   </p>
<p>As a performer she has acted for the past ten years in the one-woman Civil War drama, <em>The Color of War</em>, by Mary Guzzy, a co-production of Shakespeare &amp; Company and Ventfort Hall Association. Other classical and contemporary acting credits include: <em>The Winter's Tale</em>, <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, <em>Julius Caesar</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, <em>Coriolanus</em>, and seven plays in Greece and New York as a guest artist with the international theater company One Year Lease, including the title roles in three versions of the Phaedra myth.  She has also performed in a number of other brand new plays in New York. Contemporary roles in Boston include: Solange in Genet’s <em>The Maids</em>, two turns as the primary mind in Sarah Kane’s <em>4.48 Psychosis</em>, and Dot in <em>7 B***jobs</em> by Mac Wellman. In Providence, in the New Plays 2000 Festival, she originated the role of Eurydice in Sarah Ruhl's early play of the same name. Her first professional stage role was in a one-person play about teen dating violence which toured New England and the New York tri-state area. Bleeding to death every day before 1000 shocked teenagers, and then making them talk about it, was a trial by fire in solo performance.</p>
<p>As a teacher (this will become relevant in the Perks section—yes, there are perks!) Susannah has worked with actors of all ages in New York, Boston, Providence, the Berkshires, and Dublin. She has studied, acted, trained, taught, and directed at Shakespeare &amp; Company in Lenox, MA, throughout her professional career. She now teaches and coaches privately in New York City. Susannah graduated from Brown University with degrees in Ancient &amp; Medieval Culture and Theater and spent a year studying theatre, education, and Irish studies at the Samuel Beckett Centre for Drama &amp; Theatre Studies at Trinity College in Dublin. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute please post on facebook or tweet with your support, or send an email to people whom you think might be interested with your personal endorsement.</p>
<p>Or if you happen to know someone who would contribute an antique Victorian chaise lounge to the final production, let me know!</p>
<p>In these times not everybody has the luxury to contribute to artistic productions. I believe it is as important as anything we do.  </p>
<p>However, if you need to make tough decisions with your money I suggest the following: I contribute a small amount monthly to the education of girls in Afghanistan through Save the Children (<a href=""http://www.savethechildren.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.savethechildren.org</a>); my current favorite humanitarian project is called Zara Aina -- Share Life which sends New York theater artists to create stories with children in Madagascar (<a href=""http://www.zaraaina.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.zaraaina.org</a>); and of course there is the Red Cross.</p>
<h3>Fine Print</h3>
<p>All perks are fully transferrable.  For out of towners who cannot take advantage of all of these perks special arrangements can be made.</p>

She has studied, acted, trained, taught, and directed at Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, MA, throughout her professional career. She now teaches and coaches privately in New York City. Susannah graduated from Brown University with degrees in Ancient & Medieval Culture and Theater and spent a year studying theatre, education, and Irish studies at the Samuel Beckett Centre for Drama & Theatre Studies at Trinity College in Dublin. 


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute please post on facebook or tweet with your support, or send an email to people whom you think might be interested with your personal endorsement.
Or if you happen to know someone who would contribute an antique Victorian chaise lounge to the final production, let me know!
In these times not everybody has the luxury to contribute to artistic productions. I believe it is as important as anything we do.  
However, if you need to make tough decisions with your money I suggest the following: I contribute a small amount monthly to the education of girls in Afghanistan through Save the Children (www.savethechildren.org); my current favorite humanitarian project is called Zara Aina -- Share Life which sends New York theater artists to create stories with children in Madagascar (www.zaraaina.org); and of course there is the Red Cross.
Fine Print
All perks are fully transferrable.  For out of towners who cannot take advantage of all of these perks special arrangements can be made.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Prison Bridges Summary</h3>
<p>As an actor, director and Registered Drama Therapist, I have taught drama programs,  directed Shakespeare plays for Marin Shakespeare Company, and facilitated original theatre programs inside San Quentin State Prison and other facilitites for the past 10 years.  During my time bringing drama to incarcerated men, I have witnessed again and again how theatre serves as a powerful tool for both individual and social transformation.  At an individual level, theatre helps incarcerated men build self-expression, self-esteem, and aides them in cultivating their inner ""witness"" - their ability to stand back and reflect on themselves, their actions and their life choices.  At a social level, theatre helps raise awareness of pertinent themes and issues facing not only those who are incarcerated, but also for youth at risk and others impacted by a society in which poverty, greed, abuse and neglect continue to perpetuate the cycle of violence.  </p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you will be supporting a project that helps incarcerated men make a difference in the world rather than be a ""burden"" to society. Thanks to a $2000 CA$H Grant from Theatre Bay Area, men have already begun writing stories of transformation, in which they will share a moment in their lives that fundamentally changed how they think, perceive and act in the world.  The men will perform their stories for other prisoners at San Quentin on August 24th, 2012, thus helping to raise consciousness in the prison population. With this ""Prison Bridges"" project, we will create a ""bridge"" from within the prison to the larger community in two ways: 1) Men's stories will be performed by actors outside the prison in the ""Prison Bridges Tour.""  During this tour, each of the pieces the men write will be shared at six different youth and community centers, followed by a discussion about peace-building and violence prevention that will be facilitated by myself and by one or more ex-prisoners who have transformed their lives. 2) A documentary is currently being made which explores the growth and challenges the men face as they write and perform their individual pieces.  This documentary, ""Prison Bridges: The Film"" will be used as a social and educational tool made available to schools, community centers, rehabilitation centers as a way to provoke discussion and reflection about how to cultivate positive choices and healthy ways of being in the world.  </p>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>$7000 TOTAL</p>
<p>Breakdown:</p>
<p>$1600 for four months of drama classes and coaching to help the men expand and revise their theatre pieces</p>
<p>$1800 payable to three actors for touring show to six venues</p>
<p>$600 to assistant facilitator for leading discussion after each of the six performances</p>

<h3>UPDATE: We now have 9, that's right NINE full scholarship students! We are going to be adding a full class of new scholarships in the next few weeks!<br/>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Sky-Marie has had a dream to use dance to better people's lives for well over a decade. At the age of 18 she felt that God gave her a vision that dance could impact both the dancer and the audience at a very deep, heart level, that it could even transcend barriers like language and cultural differences and social status, that it could be used as a tool to bring healing and unity where brokenness and discord exist. So, she began experimenting with the art as a medium for social and personal growth. She went to the University of Oklahoma and double majored in dance and social anthropology, worked really hard, graduated with honors, made a lot of exciting progress, and... then life happened. With the years came children and responsibilities and ""real life"" and eventually her dream seemed entirely too distant, too difficult, too impossible to pursue. So, as many of us do with our dreams, she 
basically shelved it... <br/></p>
<p>Suddenly one day, the impossible became possible! At the end of December this year we were making our family plans and goals for the upcoming year when a new organization, Early Spring Arts Conservatory, just ""happened."" This was not planned, it really just came together in a matter of days. Sky-Marie was simply looking for space to start dancing again on her own, or maybe with a few friends, small steps towards reclaiming her original vision. Those small steps turned into a 3,500 square foot dance space with 3 dance studios and 2 classrooms! The space is large enough to house the dance company she's dreamed of directing, as well as offer dance classes for students in the community, and serve as a space to create visual art. Also within a matter of days, all the right people to help run such a wonderful place also came into line. Just like that.<br/></p>
<p>Our goal is to create a conservatory that will provide truly excellent classes that identify and nurture a student's unique gifting and talent. It's Sky-Marie's desire that no student be turned away if they have the passion to learn, regardless of income, ability, or physical limitation. We want to create really quality classes for students of all ages, special inter-disciplinary classes geared towards the homeschool community, classes for adults, classes for individuals with special needs, and advanced classes that will feed into a professional dance company. We want to offer scholarships for students who can't afford tuition. We want to impact the community with thought-provoking, cutting-edge performances. This will not be a ""competition"" studio, or a glamor studio that fosters a competitive mentality but a place where students are trained to serve and bless others through their talents. In addition to dance we are offering classes in voice, acting, musical theatre and the visual arts.<br/></p>
<p>We will be opening the conservatory on February first. We are putting the puzzle pieces together to make the Conservatory a 501(c)3 non-profit foundation. This will enable us to focus on the student rather than the ""bottom line"". We hope to offer many scholarships and work/study programs. We also will use the conservatory to reach out to the community at large through performances in the many area social gatherings. We will also be home to an independent Irish Dance company.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Donations to our campaign will free us up to focus on the art and the artist. We currently have funding to cover expenses such as rent and utilities in the space. Our current resources will be able to provide immediate full scholarships for 3 very deserving, serious dance students who have approached us for help in funding. We want to offer more scholarships to more students. In particular, there are many very deserving homeschooled students who would like to enroll, and some students with special needs. We need funding to pay the great teachers who want to teach these students. The students are ready. The teachers are ready. The space is *almost* ready. But we need your help!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently we need at least $4000. This money will go towards the purchase of a new PA system for each studio (while they have beautiful floors and mirrors we currently have no sound in the studios). Paint to paint the lobby, the halls, the classrooms and the studios. <br/></p>

Pia was a first year playwright of The Fire This Time Festival, and in 2011 her play, THE FLOWER THIEF, recieved a full length reading as part of TFTT. Horse Trade and The Fire This Time Festival proudly present the first full length production of TFTT, Pia Wilson's THE FLOWER THIEF. HT Artistic Director Heidi Grumelot is directing the play during its 9-performance run August 2nd-19th. The space: The Red Room.  Full circle. 
The Fire This Time is excited to mount its first full length production. In order to do this we need to raise funds to pay our collaborating artists for all of their hard work - this is why we need your help!

<p>Irse hacia el norte (Going Northbound) is a theater investigation project about immigration. Three legal travelers from different countries of origin will share a route with immigrants without documentation. There will be a profound exchange with the people and the real migrant experience.</p>
<p>We will start our journey from the west of Guatemala, traveling through Mexico and the US. Stopping at migrant shelters, spending time with migrants and giving theater workshops. As the play “Irse” is being performed it will also be transforming itself with every travel experience. At the end of our journey, we will share this artistic investigation based on the real experience with the audience of New Orleans. After this the play will be toured through Guatemala and in the future we plan to go to the Netherlands.</p>
<p><strong>Questions<br/></strong></p>
<p><em>I am here. But I am not allowed to be here. I am nothing. I have no social security number. I am unwanted. I have no identity. Yet I walk. Yet I work. Who am I?</em></p>
<p>In San Diego it might be easy to ignore illegal immigration, yet every San Diego resident depends on immigrant workers. New Orleans was reconstructed by mostly Latin-American immigrant workers after Katrina. Inhabitants of Acuyacán, Oaxaca, Mexico might be bothered by the neverending flow of immigrants, yet it is their own compatriots and Central Americans that suffer the consequences of the economical malaise that effects them all, crossing through their town.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Mexican and Central American migrants cross illegally to the United States annually. Not being able to feed their children or pay for rent, living in communities that are deteriorated by gang violence drives them to risk losing limbs, being robbed and raped and even drowning or dying in the desert. Families are torn apart.</p>
<p>Is it worth the risk everything to get to the other side? Is it worth it to let your children be smuggled over the border in the trunk of a car?</p>
<p> Whose fault is it? Is it the drug cartels, the failing Mexican and Central American governments, or the U.S. government or is it the people that shouldn’t even go anywhere illegally?</p>
<p>Is it absurd that a little book decides where we can and cannot be, and that Americans can touch American soil without a visa, whilst Guatemalans can’t? Or is it good and necessary for states to protect their borders?</p>
<p>What is a state anyway? And what is a nationality? Is it purely bureaucratic, or also related to deep emotions and a feeling of belonging? What happens when a person moves away from a place where he belongs to a place where nobody will give him that feeling of belonging?</p>
<p><em>The theater groups Artzénico, Armadillo and Goat in the Road Productions try to find answers to those questions and presenting them in their play “Irse” along the way to the final destination; the New Orleans Fringe Festival.</em></p>
<p><strong>Purpose<br/></strong></p>
<p>We are determined to share the real life migrant experience with non-migrants in communities that are affected by the migration issue. And thus bring locals and migrants, that are physically in the same spot, together through theater.</p>
<p>We also want to connect with the migrants along their way. Offering hope and perspective through theater and passing on their story to worldwide audiences to raise awareness and contribute to the migration dialogue. We share the belief that theater brings content and humanity together; we try to reunite the global issue with human emotion.</p>
<p>The play “Irse” will share the findings of the investigation through live internet communication, that contrasts with real walls that protect borders. Through personal stories and experiences from artists and migrants. And through scenes that make the crossing of a desert or river, the anxiety of being caught and the pain of not being able to see your family because you don’t have the right papers tangible. </p>
<p><strong>Participating groups</strong></p>
<p>The initiative is started by <em>Artzénico</em>, from Quetzaltenango (<a href=""http://www.artzenico.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.artzenico.org</a>).

<p><strong>Sustainability</strong><br/> The participants of “Irse hacia el Norte” propose to make their journey a practice of new models of artistic sustainability.

THE LISTENERS

FEBRUARY 4 - 14 at The Brick

Part of The Brick's first Resident Artist Season.

When two drifters arrive at Sistine’s door, she offers them mismatched coffee cups and something called breakfast. Outside the dogs are barking. Probably dogs. The drifters are now lodgers. They meet the family. There’s a house and people live in it. Vegetables in the garden. Board games. History. Stories. Rituals. Songs. No, not songs. We don’t sing songs here. We’ve lived this way for centuries. Or decades. Anyway, a long time. We know how to survive.

Nothing is coming to get us. Nothing makes a sound. Because if there were a sound, we would have heard it.

Starring Robert Honeywell, Jay Leibowitz*, Sarah K. Lippmann*, Moira Stone* and Stephanie Willing.

This is the beginning of the next chapter for Jester Educational Theater as I work to make a difference in the lives of kids around the world. Ultimately, I will take performers and colleagues to share these cultural-theatrical adventures. To get this Grand Scheme started, Kevin goes to Puerto Rico!The Back Story My passion is doing drama with kids. As a veteran public school teacher, I found I was getting enough kid contact, but not enough musical theater, so a few years ago I started Jester Educational Theater and have since been happily directing outstanding young performers and putting them on stages throughout the Pacific Northwest.

<p><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></p>
<p>Un homme apprend qu'il va mourir. Refusant d'attendre la fin à l'horizontale, il décide de partir, debout, à sa rencontre. Il laisse tout derrière et s’exile dans une terre qui ressemble au début ou à la fin des temps, où les glaciers chevauchent les volcans. Dans un camping, une femme propose de lui prêter main-forte dans son projet. À bord du même sac de couchage, ils prennent la route vers l'ultime destination.</p>
<p><strong>MISSION</strong></p>
<p>Je suis hypocondriaque. Depuis la tendre enfance, j'ai dû me diagnostiquer des dizaines de cancers. Je me souviens que très jeune, lorsque j'ai appris que l'on pouvait tomber malade, et même mourir, je me suis senti profondément trahi. Pourquoi goûter au plaisir d'être en vie, si l'on doit éventuellement le perdre ? Pourquoi jouir d'un corps en santé s'il doit éventuellement vieillir, souffrir et tomber malade ? J'étais révolté. En vieillissant, j'ai non seulement réalisé que l'hypocondrie est un phénomène répandu, mais qu'en plus, celui-ci semble s'exacerber depuis quelques années avec le développement de la technologie. À mes yeux, il est indéniable que la surabondance d'information via internet et les médias sociaux favorise le développement de l'anxiété et de la paranoïa dans la population en général.</p>
<p>C'est ce constat qui m'a poussé à vouloir parler de l'hypocondrie. Non seulement parce que j'en souffre, mais parce que le phénomène semble prendre de plus en plus d'ampleur. À l'exception notable du Malade imaginaire de Molière, il me semble que c'est un sujet qui reste assez peu exploré théâtralement, malgré qu'il semble toucher de plus en plus de gens. Pas seulement l'hypocondrie, mais l'anxiété en général, ou de façon plus globale, la peur. Cette peur qui envahit de plus en plus nos vies paradoxalement hyper connectées, mais aussi séparées de la réalité. Peur de l'autre. Peur de perdre. Peur de manquer quelque chose, de manquer de quelque chose. Peur de rester ou de partir. Peur de mourir. Peur de vivre. Peur de s'engager dans la vie.</p>
<p><strong>« LES HÉBERTISTES » - MANDAT ET HISTORIQUE</strong></p>
<p>Composé de Mary-Lee Picknell et de moi-même, Nicola-Frank Vachon, Les hébertistes est un collectif d'artistes de la région de Québec réuni pour la première fois. Cette collaboration est issue de l'intention de poursuivre ma réflexion et mon travail d'écriture théâtrale entamés au sein du Soucide collectif, une compagnie de création collective de Québec fondée en 2005 avec Catherine Dorion et Virginie Leclerc. Les deux spectacles créés par cette compagnie (Quand le sage pointe la lune, le fou regarde le doigt et Kukipik Doikipu), écrits collectivement via l'improvisation, avaient rencontré un accueil très chaleureux. Il s'agissait dans les deux cas d'un théâtre clownesque lapidaire et éclaté s'attaquant aux travers d'une société de plus en plus déconnectée et déshumanisée. Fort de cette expérience, je veux cette fois-ci poursuivre ma réflexion et mon exploration des thèmes qui me tiennent à cœur, mais d'une toute autre manière. C'est encore une fois un duo féminin/masculin. Les dialogues sont directs et francs. Le réalisme et la poésie s'entremêlent allègrement. L'apocalypse plane, mais avec humour. Mais cette fois-ci, c'est du théâtre d'auteur, fruit d'une réflexion plus personnelle et d'un travail plus rigoureux autour de la structure et de la langue.</p>

Directed by seasoned Irish theatre and screen director, Jessie Kirby, and starring a fresh, young cast of Irish young people from just 16 years old, ""BRB"" received empassioned responses from audiences and critics alike at its debut at the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival, hitting nerves and stirring memories of what it really is like to be a young person trying to decide what you will make of your life. </p>

<h4><b>“TO LIVE, DARLING:” WORKSHOP ET TRAILER</b></h4>
<p>""To Live, Darling"" tells the story of comédienne Réjane, from humble to haute, using text, movement, music and the plays that made her famous during the Belle Époque.

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">All funds donated to The Réjane Project’s “To Live, Darling” through this campaign will fund our September rehearsals, presentation and trailer shoot in Los Angeles.

<p>Huge things have already been generously donated. Our co-producer, The Bootleg Theater, is providing rehearsal, performance and shooting space.

<p><b>THE REJANE PROJECT - C'EST IMPORTANT!</b></p>
<p><b>The Réjane Project</b> was born when Ilana Turner sat in her friend’s living room staring at a Toulouse-Lautrec drawing and a Boldini painting of the French actress Gabrielle Réjane. Réjane, it turned out, was her friend's grandmother. So began five years of Réjane Project research and the resulting play ""To Live, Darling.""</p>
<p>“To Live, Darling” incorporates original text, text from the plays that made Réjane famous in her time, and original music by Réjane’s great-great granddaughter Adrien Reju. European Director Christopher Sivertsen’s staging is developing from his lauded physical theatre style. “To Live, Darling” celebrates a woman who lived before her time both on–stage and off–, and whose reality frequently mirrored the (sometimes equally) groundbreaking characters she played on stage. </p>
<p>Although Réjane’s story unfolded over a hundred years ago, many of this plays‘ themes are still familiar, embattled and entirely applicable today. As a working mother whose insatiable quest for artistic growth fed herself, and the artistic and sociopolitical worlds around her, Réjane set a precedent for the world we know today. As Tina Fey said, “The life of a working parent is constantly saying 'This is impossible,' and then you keep doing it.” Réjane did it 125 years ago, and as she did, her work and life evolved into something we would recognize as modern today.</p>
<p>Said Rico Gagliano of the Dinner Party Download, ""I saw scenes from 'To Live, Darling' at a showcase of new work, and was struck by its humor, intelligence and style -- kind of Howard Hawkes meets Moulin Rouge. Can't wait to see a full production that gets to play with the piece's ingenious backstage/frontstage structure.""</p>

</p><p>THE PROJECT:</p>
<p>To present a staged, choreographed, lit and costumed
workshop production of <i>Siren’s Den, </i>a
new rock musical, in April 2016 in NYC. 
The show will be performed in the East Village at Under St. Mark’s, an
exclusive 40 seat venue with an underground rock club vibe.  Audience feedback will help to further develop
the piece for future festivals and larger productions.</p>
<p>THE SHOW:</p>
<p><i>Siren’s Den</i> is a
full length rock musical with book, music and lyrics by Rori Nogee (Star of
Off-Broadway’s acclaimed <i>Showgirls, the
Musical</i>! and writer of <i>Down This
Road).</i>   <i>Siren’s
Den </i>is a cautionary tale about the emptiness of fame, the
blindness of love, and the healing powers of writing through the darkest times.  The 23 original songs in the score are in the
vein of 90’s rock meets <i>Spring Awakening</i>
and <i>Rent, </i>with haunting melodies and story-driving lyrics.  The cast is comprised of 12 powerhouse triple
threat performers.</p><p>MULTIMEDIA:</p><p>Check out sneak peeks of the songs on Soundcloud!</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/sirens-den-musical"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/sirens-den-musical</a></span></p><p>""Siren's Den"" is featured in the blog, Call Me Adam!  Read the article here:</p><p><a href=""http://www.callmeadam.com/interviews/2016/2/18/call-redialed-rori-nogee-sirens-den.html#.Vsag2lKJnzK"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.callmeadam.com/interviews/2016/2/18/call-redialed-rori-nogee-sirens-den.html#.Vsag2lKJnzK</a></p>
<p>THE GOAL:</p>
<p>We hope that the presentation of this musical will be an
invaluable experience to all involved. 
The writer will see and hear her work on its feet and gage the reactions
of its first live audience; the audience will see a world premiere of a piece
in development and give constructive feedback to further improve the show; the
actors will have an opportunity to perform professionally on a NY stage and create
a new work from the ground up.  </p>
<p>THE PLOT:</p>
<p><i>Siren’s Den</i> is a
dark, modern twist on the myth of the ancient Greek sirens who lured sailors to
their deaths with their songs.  Here,
the turbulent sea is the music industry, and the siren is Skylar Cole, a seductive
indie rock singer in NYC. </p>
<p>Skylar’s biggest fan is Remy Morgan, a young, aspiring
singer who finds that her songwriting is fueled by her time spent with
Skylar.  Although Remy and Skylar form an
immediate bond, their attempts at connection are thwarted by Skylar’s hungry
fans, the Vultures, her possessive personal assistant, her suspicious
boyfriend, and her own sordid past.</p>
<p>Soon, Remy finds herself drawn into a world of drugs,
lust and empty promises, where  some
idols don’t deserve pedestals and some dreams come with dire consequences.  </p>
<p>Will Remy find success? 
Or will she fall prey to Skylar’s siren song forever?</p>
<p>WHERE THE MONEY GOES:</p>
<p>All of the money raised will go to funding the workshop
production.  Expenses include:</p>
<p>-Paying the 12 actors </p>
<p>-Paying the creative team</p>
<p>-Paying the musicians who help make arrangements for the
backing vocal tracks</p>
<p>-Paying for the transcription of sheet music</p>
<p>-Paying for the use of the performance space in the East

<p>-Paying for 2 weeks of rehearsal space, which includes large
dance studios to choreograph the explosive dance numbers</p>
<p>-Paying for audition space to cast the talented actors</p>
<p>-Paying for a piano accompanist for the singing auditions</p>
<p>-Paying for the printing of scripts for the entire company</p>
<p>-Paying for the printing of advertising postcards</p>

This production is an opportunity for members of our organization to learn and grow as fight performers, and gives veteran members a chance to keep themselves sharp while bringing astonishing, brutal entertainment to thousands of fans. We are using this campaign to help support our performers and crew, as well as provide extra ways to connect with fans!
 

There is no greater thing than standing victorious in the arena.
The DC Stunt Coalition (DCSC) has brought on by Red Serpents, LLC. to perform the official live action gladiator fights for the only official U.S. Spartacus-themed fan convention, Spartacon.
 For the last few months, DCSC has been in production of their next astonishing gladiator fight show. It has been a challenging road, requiring all of us to sacrifice time, money, and give up all things cake-like in order to become the Champions you'll be seeing on August 13th and 14th at the Waldorf Arena.
 

 
We need your help to show appreciation to this marvelous collection of incredibly talented stunt performers and action actors as they give blood, sweat, and tears upon the sands for your entertainment. We've already performed incredibly well-received and successful shows at MAGFest, AwesomeCon, and Otakon. Spartacon is our next stop on the road to glory! This campaign is being produced in an effort to support our cast, give the audience a chance to interact with us in some very unique and awesome ways, all to insure our excitement and inspiration when producing future shows.
 
If you can offer us your patronage, not only will we reward you with special tribute items, but we'll also shout out your name in the arena, in front of thousands of fans and even the original cast of the hit Starz television series, Spartacus.
 By giving us your support this time around, you're insuring not only the success of this performance, but helping to fund future performances from the DC Stunt Coalition by showing that there is in fact an audience for these kind of bad-ass, non-stop action spectaculars for all fandoms and genres.
Help Our Ludus! Become a patron of our gladiators, and join us in glory upon the sands!
The DC Stunt Coalition (DCSC) is aiming to raise just $1,000 to go towards paying our production crew and the cast a fair reimbursement for their hard work and long hours spent putting this show together. Every performer has purchased at least one personal training weapon (a Cold Steel training gladius valued at $22), as well as costume stunt shoes ($26 a pair), and paid 3 months of dues towards DC Stunt Coalition in order to afford training space and time ($60 per person). We want to do our best to reimburse our gladiators for these training costs.  
Anything we can profit on will also go towards the DC Stunt Coalition coffers - the publicity from this campaign, as well as your continued support and patronage, will help us to make bigger, better shows in the future. Not just for Spartacon, but for MAGFest, Otakon, AwesomeCon, and more. We'd love to perform at all of these events, but without a source of crowd funds, we can't afford to do all of them! Help us take our show on the road. Funds from this campaign will also go towards producing OFFICIAL DC Stunt Coalition Gladiator T-shirts, tank tops, and photo cards (to be signed at SPARTACON), so that we can better promote our brand at the event, and allow for a more interactive connection with our fan base. We want to make you guys a part of the action! Your donations will allow us to spend time at the event meeting-and-greeting with you, the fans, by providing us with better accouterments to our Ludus Suite.

 
Even if we can't reach our entire goal, we'll be splitting what we raise between our production crew, as well as putting it towards providing the above mentioned perks to the fans. More than anything, we want YOU, the audience, to be a part of this show, whether that means wearing our colors with our bad ass, Spartacus: Blood and Sand inspired T-shirt, or by taking home a signed photo post card featuring our own gladiators in their incredible costumes, as created by Motley Maker Designs. Our costume designer, Rachel, has already put in over 100 hours of unpaid time to create 15 unique, genuine leather-and-rivet Gladiator costumes - including tributes to Spartacus, Crixus, and the Shadow of Death himself, Theokolese, and even original characters to introduce to the sands this year!

<div>Since 2008, Brittany Whitmoyer has been creating dance professionally and sharing it with the world. 2008 was the year she began <i>bnw:dance</i>, a contemporary company that has been called ""<i>a solid pickup troupe that's serious about concept, craft and execution</i>."" (<b>Time Out Chicago</b>). Since then, bnw:dance has been seen in NYC, Richmond, VA, Chicago, Washington DC, Philadelphia, and London. </div>
<div>In 2012 Whitmoyer put a pause on <i>bnw:dance </i>to focus on receiving her MFA in Dance, which she completed in 2014. </div>
<div>Back in choreography action and in a new city, Whitmoyer is proud and honored to be selected as a Dance Canvas choreographer for the 2014-2015 season. This opportunity will allow her and her dancers to push further into the exploratory and work with new concepts of mixing both film and dance in a collaborative setting. </div>
<div>
<i><b>site.</b></i> is Whitmoyer's newest work and will be premiered during the Dance Canvas season, at Rialto Center for the Arts, January 23-24. The process is based on the generation of ""site specific choreography."" Though this is a performance for the stage, the choreography will be conceptualized from different areas all over the city of Atlanta. These pinpoints will be filmed, and ultimately projected behind the dancers throughout the performance. Each movement and every intention in their steps will come from a park, a street corner, or even a sign, from different neighborhoods throughout Atlanta.  </div>
<div>Our ultimate hope is for the audience to find a newfound love for their community and surroundings, the way site dance often assists with, though the power of movement. </div>

Since 2008, Brittany Whitmoyer has been creating dance professionally and sharing it with the world. 2008 was the year she began bnw:dance, a contemporary company that has been called ""a solid pickup troupe that's serious about concept, craft and execution."" (Time Out Chicago). Since then, bnw:dance has been seen in NYC, Richmond, VA, Chicago, Washington DC, Philadelphia, and London. 
In 2012 Whitmoyer put a pause on bnw:dance to focus on receiving her MFA in Dance, which she completed in 2014. 
Back in choreography action and in a new city, Whitmoyer is proud and honored to be selected as a Dance Canvas choreographer for the 2014-2015 season. This opportunity will allow her and her dancers to push further into the exploratory and work with new concepts of mixing both film and dance in a collaborative setting. 

site. is Whitmoyer's newest work and will be premiered during the Dance Canvas season, at Rialto Center for the Arts, January 23-24. The process is based on the generation of ""site specific choreography."" Though this is a performance for the stage, the choreography will be conceptualized from different areas all over the city of Atlanta. These pinpoints will be filmed, and ultimately projected behind the dancers throughout the performance. Each movement and every intention in their steps will come from a park, a street corner, or even a sign, from different neighborhoods throughout Atlanta.  
Our ultimate hope is for the audience to find a newfound love for their community and surroundings, the way site dance often assists with, though the power of movement.

Water Street, in Milwaukee, WI on Sept. 13th, 14th and 15th, a salute to the campiness of the 1960's beach movie genre and The King himself.</h3>
<h3>Such great acts as Gravity Plays Favorites, Tomahawk Tassels, Pouty Petals, Vince V Vice, Molotov Maybelle, the Hale O Malo hula dancers, Gypsy Geoff, Francesca Alfresca, Sir Pinkerton, and physical comedian Micheal Guthrie have committed to this show. I am still in talks with even more great talent, and hope to bring you the best show possible.</h3>
<h3>Hi, my name is Alice Wilson-Stuart, a local producer from Milwaukee. I've recently started my own production company, Rockabilly Girl Productions, and just completed my first successful show/event under that banner (Horror-O-Rama.) The Blue Hawaii Spectacular is near and dear to my heart, as I was struck by inspiration, when on my honeymoon, I saw the ""Viva Elvis"" Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas. I thought of all the great performers I know locally, and across the country, and really wanted to build a fantastic show for Milwaukee. I've always wanted to start a rockabilly weekender, and while this 3 day event will have aspects of that, it also combines my first true love, theatre.</h3>
<h3>
<br/>Here's a quick rundown of the weekend:</h3>
<h3>Fri. Sept. 13th &amp; Sat. Sept. 14th: 7:30P - Blue Hawaii Spectacular Variety Show at Next Act Theatre</h3>
<h3>Sat. Sept. 14th: 2-6P - Party at Next Act Theatre with live music, food, vendors, car show and Miss Blue Hawaii Pin Up Contest! FREE, No admission fee for this part of the event!</h3>
<h3>Sun. Sept. 15th: 12noon-2P - Pig Party at Smoke Shack, our fabulous sponsor! FREE, No admission fee for this part of the event!</h3>
<h3>Sun. Sept. 15th: 2P - Blue Hawaii ALL Elvis Impersonator Contest/Show aka Mr. Blue Hawaii</h3>
<h3>These Indiegogo funds are needed for box office &amp; theatre staff, travel and accomodations for national acts, entertainment for our Saturday shindig, as well as promotional and marketing materials and airtime.  If the goal is reached, The Exotics, an amazing local surf band, will be able to be hired as ""house band"" for the variety show, which would be awesome! I am hoping to make the ""Spectacular"" an annual event, with a different theme each year.</h3>
<h3>If you're on the fence about donating, I hope the ""perks"" being offered will move you to contribute, from an Indiegogo exclusive designed tee shirt to coffee mugs to bowling shirts, and even tickets.  If you cannot contribute, I sure would appreciate it if you could pass on the word to your friends, or anyone you may know who you think would enjoy this rockin' good time. Indiegogo makes it easy with their sharing tools!<br/>Thank you for reading this, and I hope to see you Sept. 13, 14 &amp; 15th at Next Act Theatre. And if you see my husband in a grass skirt, thank him for me for all his support.</h3></div>","The BLUE HAWAII SPECTACULAR will be a rockabilly, fun and sun, weekend event & variety show featuring some of the best and most unique acrobatic, vaudeville and burlesque acts from all over the US at Next Act Theatre, 255 S.

My name is Diana Westphal and together with my dear colleague Federica Rangel, we are bringing a play about peaceful resistance against nazi Germany to life in New York.</p><p>“Sophie Scholl- The Final Days”, written by Fred Breinersdorfer and Betty Hensel, follows the siblings Hans and Sophie Scholl, who form a resistance group named The White Rose in 1943. Together with a group of college friends, they secretly print and distribute anti-nazi flyers that call for a peaceful overthrow of Hitler. They are apprehended and we follow them through their days of interrogation and imprisonment, all the way to their final trial.</p><p><strong>Why this story and why in New York?</strong></p><p>Sophie and Hans grew up in southern Germany, in the city of Ulm, two blocks away from where I grew up. The courage the siblings and all members of the White Rose found within themselves, made them my heroes ever since I was a kid. Now, as a young theater artist living in New York, I want to build a bridge from Ulm all the way to the United States, by sharing one of Germany's most inspirational stories from her darkest time in history. I want to not only commemorate the White Rose’s almost inexplicably brave resistance, but also pose the question that Sophie has made me ask myself again and again: what would I have done in her place? What am I doing today?</p><p>By contributing to this campaign, you can help us strengthen transatlantic cultural exchange, understand how resistance can look like, and allow us to reevaluate what freedom of speech, religious freedom, and democracy mean for us. Furthermore, this play is a powerful study about privilege, and the impact we can have when we hold it. This production examines how Sophie and her friends fought against a  power structure that systemically would have benefited them. Their story feels as potent as ever, given the current political and cultural climate and the global conversation around privilege today. </p><p>We, the production team Federica and Diana, are very excited to make our dream come true and produce this world premiere of the English version of ""Sophie Scholl- The Final Days.“ The two of us became friends and collaborators during our conservatory training at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting in New York City. As graduates of '18, we are grateful to now find ourselves with the time, resources, energy and the support of our school, to be able to produce this play which is so relevant and personal to each of us. </p><p><strong>What difference will your contribution make?</strong></p><ol>
<li>You will enable two young artists to offer new and international work to the New York audience.</li>
<li>You will allow the audience to experience a story about non-violent political resistance and to be inspired by the courage and moral strength of the White Rose.</li>
<li>You will be among our vital first contributors, enabling us to begin our journey with this play. We will be documenting this production through video and photos, which will then allow us to apply for larger artist grants next year. </li>
<li>We have hopes to traveling to England and other countries. To make that happen, it's vital to document this very first production. That way our play can grow and be presented in other countries.

With one to three participants embodying different dancers at the same time, the participants’ movement around the space creates a new performance of the piece in and of itself which can be observed from the outside visitor.If you're unable to donate, please spread the word to others who might be interested in attending or supporting!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What Is Girly Girl?</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Lily Chrones and I use they/them pronouns. I am the Co-Founder/Artistic Director of The Euphoria Theatre Project, a new company that aims to highlight the LGBTQIA+ experience by putting intersectionality at the forefront of everything we do. I am also the creator of my one person show, Girly Girl!</p>
<p>The show is a mixed media performance which I first conceived as a film for my senior capstone in 2020. Unfortunately due to COVID-19 I wasn't able to perform Girly Girl on the stage and had to completely reimagine it to be shared remotely.</p>
<p>My collaborators and I are thrilled that we get an opportunity to finally bring Girly Girl to life on the fringe stage, but we need your help!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get!</h3>
<p>In order to bring Girly Girl to the fringe stage, we need your support! With your generous donations we will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay our creative team for all of the hard work they are doing.</li>
<li>Cover our venue and travel costs.</li>
<li>Cover our costume, wig, prop and scenery expenses.</li>
<li>Cover marketing and advertising fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>We crunched the numbers and found that the lowest amount we can feasibly ask for is <strong>$4,500</strong> to bring you the absolute best! Any donation at all would be greatly appreciated. The following <strong>donation tiers</strong> receive special appreciation:</p>
<ul>
<li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As you may know, there is so much theatre that centers around queer and transgender tragedy and I strive to create work that highlights queer and transgender joy and resistance. Through all of the art that I create I seek to abolish the binary and create new ways of storytelling that encompass and highlight fluid identities, ideally sparking critical conversations that lead to actionable change. </p>
<p>Girly girl is a story about perseverance, joy, innocence, loss, love, passion, denial, acceptance, confusion, and clarity. I want anyone to be able to watch this show and say “Wow I do that!” Or “I know someone like that!” My goal is not only for people to learn what being non-binary is, but to discover that we are more than our gender identity. We are complex, unique individuals who exist next door even if you don’t know we do, and come in all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Just like gender cannot be assumed, life cannot be planned and Girly Girl highlights what happens when a child influenced by social media plans their life before even knowing who they are. More than anything Girly Girl is meant to tell my story, so maybe I can inspire people to think differently about the gender roles and expectations we place on children, or to simply think about us non-binary folk at all.</p>
<p>By supporting Girly Girl you are helping uplift marginalized voices by bringing this queer coming-of-age story to the stage. </p>

Hello! My name is Lily Chrones and I use they/them pronouns. I am the Co-Founder/Artistic Director of The Euphoria Theatre Project, a new company that aims to highlight the LGBTQIA+ experience by putting intersectionality at the forefront of everything we do. I am also the creator of my one person show, Girly Girl!
The show is a mixed media performance which I first conceived as a film for my senior capstone in 2020. Unfortunately due to COVID-19 I wasn't able to perform Girly Girl on the stage and had to completely reimagine it to be shared remotely.
My collaborators and I are thrilled that we get an opportunity to finally bring Girly Girl to life on the fringe stage, but we need your help!
 

What We Need & What You Get!
In order to bring Girly Girl to the fringe stage, we need your support! With your generous donations we will be able to:

Pay our creative team for all of the hard work they are doing.
Cover our venue and travel costs.
Cover our costume, wig, prop and scenery expenses.
Cover marketing and advertising fees.

We crunched the numbers and found that the lowest amount we can feasibly ask for is $4,500 to bring you the absolute best! Any donation at all would be greatly appreciated. The following donation tiers receive special appreciation:


$15 - You get your name in our virtual program!

$25 - You get your name in our virtual program plus super cute package of lilypops (lollipops) designed by me!

$50 - You get all of that plus an exclusive link to the filmed performance.

$75 - You get all of that plus a signed Girly Girl poster by me!

$100+ You get all of that plus you get to be an executive producer for Girly Girl.

It's also my goal for <i>New Jersey Stage</i>.  About 7 years ago I ran a print publication called <i>Upstage Magazine</i> that covered the arts throughout Central New Jersey.  That publication covered the arts in ways the mainstream media couldn't afford to.  In the years that have passed, more and more newspapers and magazines have cut their staffs with those covering the arts among the first to go.  I believe in the arts, and believe the arts deserves and relies upon media coverage.  I'm plunging back into covering the arts full-time again and hope that some of the artists, theatre companies, and performing arts centers that will benefit from that coverage help contribute to this campaign.  We're all in this together.<br/></p><p>This time around, I'm cutting the cord from print.  Despite being a long-time print guy, I believe it's time to go digital.  I'm excited at the possibilities of including audio, video, and interactive features inside a magazine. I look forward to working with social media to have articles and complete issues travel around the world and reach more people than any print publication ever could.  And I'm excited to give arts organizations and artists their opportunity to shine again.<br/></p><p>Digital publishing also allows me to keep my costs down, which means I'm able to offer great advertising opportunities for extremely low costs.  Ad prices will start at just $25 for two weeks advertising online or an 1/8 page ad in the digital magazine.  <br/></p><p>That's why I'm saying that we're all in this together.  By helping me launch this new digital magazine and website, you're helping artists and art organizations throughout the state.  Whether you are an artist or you enjoy the arts (going to a show, a concert, a poetry reading, etc.), you'll benefit from <i>New Jersey Stage</i>.<br/></p><br/><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/539957/files/20140428103913-SampleIssue.jpg?1398706753"" src="""" style=""width: 234.608px; height: 281px;""/>  <a href=""http://winetimemedia.com/UpstageHighlights.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://winetimemedia.com/Upstage/UpstageHighlights.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here</a> for info on the old magazine...<br/></p>Why We're Doing This Campaign and <br/><h3>Where The Money Will Go<br/>
</h3><p>I know digital magazines are something new and not everyone will understand why we're abandoning print, but I believe digital publishing isn't the future, it's the present.  Digital is the perfect complement to social media and is a great way to showcase the arts (from backstage interviews to music videos and photo galleries).  Unfortunately, going digital has its own challenges.  The main challenge is simply letting people know we exist.</p><p>When I published <i>Upstage Magazine</i>, I had dozens of those boxes on busy street corners where people could pick up an issue.  That was incredible exposure 24 hours a day -- sort of like a little billboard in a downtown area.  I can accomplish the same thing with online marketing.  In fact, I believe I can build an audience in even less time with a digital magazine than a print one if enough marketing is done. So, <b>marketing</b> is where the majority of campaign money will go.</p><p><b>Content</b> is the second place.  As a writer, I believe in getting paid for my work and I want to pay writers as well.  Contributions to this campaign will help me build a nice staff of freelance writers to keep the magazine content at a very high level.  The better the content, the more readers we'll have.</p><p>The third area is with the <b>various costs</b> associated with digital publishing itself.  These include special subscriptions to software, web hosting, credit card transaction subscriptions, and design costs.  These costs may a fraction of what print publishing costs are, but they add up as well.<br/></p><br/><h3>The Long Story<br/>
</h3><p></p>We have plenty of great incentives to offer fans of the arts from tickets to upcoming plays and concerts to autographed books and CDs to <i>New Jersey Stage</i> t-shirts.  There are special advertising packages for arts organizations and businesses as well. And if you're interested in hearing the whole story, please read on...<br/><br/>New Jersey and the arts go together… they really do.  If there’s one thing New Jersey should be proud of it is the artists and dreamers who grow up and live throughout the state.  We also have an impressive list of events taking place every week from small clubs and theaters to performing arts centers and basketball arenas, the problem is keeping up with it all.  And it’s a growing problem…<br/><br/>Newspapers and magazines throughout the country are cutting staff in order to reduce expenses, and media within New Jersey is following suit as well.  Unfortunately, coverage for the arts is usually among the first places cut.  Two decades ago, newspapers regularly covered community theatre productions.  Today, community theaters are simply ignored and theatre fans should consider themselves lucky if they find coverage of the State’s many Equity companies in the mainstream media.  Coverage for theatre (and really all of the arts) is generally found among bloggers who once were paid reporters, but are now reporting simply as a hobby.  <br/><br/>If professional theatre in a region near Broadway is difficult for the media to cover, what chance do you think dance companies or poetry readings or even rock and roll clubs featuring largely unknown, up-and-coming artists have for coverage? There are some media outlets that still have writers covering these beats on occasion, but far less often than before. The arts just isn’t profitable enough for the mainstream media to cover.  Their pages cost too much to print to give coverage to venues and artists who don’t advertise with them.<br/><br/>This is why there is a need for <i>New Jersey Stage</i>.  I’m an old-school publisher who believes it is time to cut the cord with print.  For roughly five years, I ran a print newspaper called <i>Upstage Magazine</i> that covered the arts throughout Central New Jersey.  We covered art, music, film, theatre, comedy, dance, poetry, literature and more.  Many times, we provided the first coverage these artists ever received.  In some cases, the only coverage.  This was because we cared about the arts more than we cared about covering something that would guarantee an ad sale.  In the end, this approach was vindicated with three Asbury Park Music Awards for Top Music Journalist and one for Top Music Publication, becoming the only publication other than <i>The Aquarian</i> to ever receive that award.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/539984/files/20140428105052-UpstageHighlights.jpg?1398707452"" src="""" style=""""/></p>I still love the way a print magazine looks, but I believe the traditional business model doesn’t work anymore.  I’ll miss the smell of fresh ink when I pick up the papers, but won’t miss breaking my back delivering the issues.  After my time with <i>Upstage</i>, I went on to cover the automotive industry but the arts organizations kept sending me their press releases and asking for coverage of their shows and events.  So I started a website called NewJerseyStage.com and published their releases as a hobby.  Every now and then when I had time I would add some features or artist interviews.  Six years later, I noticed that the website was beginning to attract a very strong number of visitors — tens of thousands each month.  I decided it was worth it to return to the arts and give it another shot.  I’m essentially bringing back <i>Upstage</i> as a purely digital magazine.  And, I believe its time to go digital.<br/><br/>Digital magazines have many advantages over print.  For one thing, they are a lot less expensive to produce; they’re far better for the environment, without physical copies to recycle or that get thrown away; they offer the use of audio, video, animation, and photo galleries; and, perhaps most importantly, they are the perfect complement to social media.<br/><br/>Just imagine someone reading an article they like in a digital magazine.  With the click of a button, they can simply email a link or the actual magazine to a friend.  They can post the link on social media sites like Facebook or Twitter and help spread the word to thousands instantly.  Articles can literally circle the globe — within a few minutes, more people could read that article and get copies of the magazine than you could ever print! <br/><br/>One prominent entertainment writer from a major newspaper in the state recently told me, “It has always struck me that what New Jersey really needs is a good, all-purpose arts web site, with active social media engagement.”  <br/><br/>That’s exactly what I’m trying to do with <i>New Jersey Stage</i>.  My goal is to create a monthly digital magazine and daily website that promotes the arts and utilizes social media in ways the mainstream media simply doesn’t understand.  The website currently adds articles and news every day to go along with the largest arts event calendar in the state.  Both the website and magazine have been designed with tablets and mobile phones in mind.  Users can easily add events to their phone or computer calendar, email event listings and articles to friends, and read everything for free.  That last part is something you may have noticed is changing within the mainstream media.  More and more newspapers are allowing people to only read a few articles for free each month, hoping to force people into subscriptions.  That’s the old school mentality and it is what is killing the industry.  It also winds up hurting arts organizations who now have less readers than before.<br/><br/>Anybody that has ever worked in publishing has always known that the future was online and digital.  Unfortunately, too many people in the industry continue to fight that inevitability.  If you are a fan of the arts — if you enjoy going to live events or are an artist yourself — please make a contribution to this campaign.  <i>New Jersey Stage</i> has a plan to help promote the arts and thrive in the new media era.  The website and magazine will offer advertising at rates that arts organizations can afford and provide the coverage they need.  Every contribution is greatly appreciated and will help us successfully launch a new digital magazine that can change the way arts is covered in New Jersey.

This has since become a dream of mine to follow in their footsteps. This is where you come. I seeking to raise $10,000 to cover the following expenses:
Theatre fees - A Monkey needs places to perform.
Director fee - A Monkey needs direction.

Travel expenses - A Monkey has got to travel.
Food - A Monkey has got to eat.
Accommodations - A Monkey has to sleep.
Promotion - A Monkey has to talk about his Monkey self.
Thus far I have raised $3000 in donations. This includes a frequent flyer ticket, help with  setting up a blog, consultation on promoting my show, poster design, help in launching this Indie Go Go campaign, and a couple of nights stay on a sofa in San Francisco. I am also applying for a traveling grant which could net me $2500.Other Ways You Can Help A MonkeyIf you are short on funds but would still like to help here are ways you can:
Frequent flyer miles
Accommodations
Buying tickets to see my show
Telling your friends to see my show
Food
Me & My Monkey thank you for taking the time to look at my campaign. I will see you in Canada!--Bradley Spann",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>""Brooklyn Boy"" can continue to inspire audiences with your help! </p>
<p>Inspired by the life true stories of Steven Prescod, ""Brooklyn Boy"" is a riveting, and emotionally impactful, one man show that tells a coming of age redemption story, as he journey's from young boy to manhood.</p>
<p>But Steven is just one of many young people, who have an important, and inspiring, story to share. Through supporting his performance, and workshops with young people through The CityKids Foundation, our goal is to inspire other young people across the country. Through cutting edge arts and leadership training, CityKids can allow other Brooklyn boys, Bronx boys, Queens girls… young people all across the city, the country, the world, to have an opportunity to turn personal growth into opportunities for social change through the arts.</p>
<p>Steven was presented the opportunity to avoid prison by taking part in an alternative to prison program that placed him at The CityKids Foundation, a nonprofit youth organization with an arts component that introduced him to the world of acting. This is where Steven met his mentor Artistic Director Moises Roberto Belizario who took Steven under his tutelage and developed his stories into a gripping 90 minutes tale of love, family, the streets, gang violence and self-acceptance. </p>
<p>The CityKids Foundation is very proud to support ""Brooklyn Boy"", and to kick of it's 30 year celebration continuing the work of supporting young people in recognizing the power of their voice.</p>
<p>Your support will help fund the continued development, opportunities to workshop his performance with audiences, and production costs for Brooklyn Boy in order to get his amazing work to a larger audience, and a portion of your contribution will help The CityKids Foundation to continue to help the voices of young people be heard.</p>
<p>CityKids' plan is to stipend, and begin developing youth trainers in January, to hit schools in all 5 boroughs and beyond - empowering these schools with a safe space model and arts/leadership workshops by February 1st. We're continuing the work CityKids' has done for the past three decades, empowering young people to inspire each other to positively impact their lives, their communities, and the world. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Alice Kaderlan of The Seattle Times writes, </span><br/></p>

<p><em>""Ashani Dances Is On The Rise ... Harrison, with three very different works. Together, they showcased an artist of diverse talents with sophisticated musical tastes and an understanding of how to use a bare stage to full effect. Appearing at the Broadway Performance Hall, Harrison relied on lighting, rather than expensive sets, to enhance the mood and energy of his ballets. The costumes were simple but effective ..."" </em><br/><a href=""http://seattletimes.com/html/thearts/2023801915_ashanireviewxml.html?syndication=rss"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://seattletimes.com/html/thearts/2023801915_ashanireviewxml.html?syndication=rss</a></p>
<p>Gabrielle Nomura of Seattle Dances writes,<br/>""The result is a company [Ashani Dances] on par with Seattle’s elite in contemporary dance: Spectrum Dance Theater and Whim W’him,Harrison’s international experience and classical background presents a refreshing niche in Seattle’s contemporary dance market; his technical, virtuosic dancers are appealing to both dance aficionados, as well as the general public."" <br/><a href=""http://seattledances.com/2014/06/harrison-helps-dancers-soar-at-ashani/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://seattledances.com/2014/06/harrison-helps-dancers-soar-at-ashani/</a></p>
<p>Ciara McCormack of Seattle Dances writes:<br/><em>""Harrison’s The Leaves Have Fallen ... lifts and transitions were seamless, a constant connection between the dancers carrying them from one set to the next ... the structure of the piece rose to the surface, highlighting the identities of the characters and reflecting the development of their dialogue. The work’s vocabulary and the magnetic ebb and flow of the dancers’ spatial relationship implied an intimate relationship, which can easily be construed as a depiction of romantic struggle and loss. Harrison stressed in the talk that his mentorship of a younger dancer and the experience of sending him off to a new opportunity inspired the piece. At its heart, Leaves is a tough conversation between two people who love and respect each other, who rely on each other, yet have separate paths to follow."" </em><br/><a href=""http://seattledances.com/2014/05/veteran-dancers-take-seattle-dance-project-home/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://seattledances.com/2014/05/veteran-dancers-take-seattle-dance-project-home/</a></p>
<p>Dean Speer of  Critical Dance Forum writes, </p>
<p>""Not only did Harrison show off what the dancers can do, the dancers showed off his truly excellent dances."" </p>

<p></p>
<p>Michael Upchurch of the Seattle Times writes,</p>
<p>""Last weekend I described Ashani Dances as ""a promising new local dance company."" Scratch that. This troupe is exceptionally accomplished, and their showcase of three new works by artistic director Iyun Ashani Harrison is a knockout. Most of the dancers have an affiliation with Cornish College of the Arts where Harrison teaches (some are graduates, some still students). All have strong, agile ballet skills which are given an intoxicating Afro-Caribbean twist in ""Artifact,"" a joyous, sassy, intricate homage to what Harrison calls ""the beautiful traditional dances of my childhood in Jamaica."" Local composer-percussionist Ben Morrow penned the dance-propulsive score. Sean Rosado and Sam Picart are reasons alone to catch this while you can.""</p>

The Impact
We would like to share some of the positive feedback about ASHANI DANCES' concerts in Seattle prior to relocating to Baltimore.
Alice Kaderlan of The Seattle Times writes, 

""Ashani Dances Is On The Rise ... Harrison, with three very different works. Together, they showcased an artist of diverse talents with sophisticated musical tastes and an understanding of how to use a bare stage to full effect. Appearing at the Broadway Performance Hall, Harrison relied on lighting, rather than expensive sets, to enhance the mood and energy of his ballets. The costumes were simple but effective ..."" http://seattletimes.com/html/thearts/2023801915_ashanireviewxml.html?syndication=rss
Gabrielle Nomura of Seattle Dances writes,""The result is a company [Ashani Dances] on par with Seattle’s elite in contemporary dance: Spectrum Dance Theater and Whim W’him,Harrison’s international experience and classical background presents a refreshing niche in Seattle’s contemporary dance market; his technical, virtuosic dancers are appealing to both dance aficionados, as well as the general public."" http://seattledances.com/2014/06/harrison-helps-dancers-soar-at-ashani/
Ciara McCormack of Seattle Dances writes:""Harrison’s The Leaves Have Fallen ... lifts and transitions were seamless, a constant connection between the dancers carrying them from one set to the next ... the structure of the piece rose to the surface, highlighting the identities of the characters and reflecting the development of their dialogue. The work’s vocabulary and the magnetic ebb and flow of the dancers’ spatial relationship implied an intimate relationship, which can easily be construed as a depiction of romantic struggle and loss. Harrison stressed in the talk that his mentorship of a younger dancer and the experience of sending him off to a new opportunity inspired the piece. At its heart, Leaves is a tough conversation between two people who love and respect each other, who rely on each other, yet have separate paths to follow."" http://seattledances.com/2014/05/veteran-dancers-take-seattle-dance-project-home/
Dean Speer of  Critical Dance Forum writes, 
""Not only did Harrison show off what the dancers can do, the dancers showed off his truly excellent dances."" 
http://www.ballet-dance.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=37023

Michael Upchurch of the Seattle Times writes,
""Last weekend I described Ashani Dances as ""a promising new local dance company."" Scratch that. This troupe is exceptionally accomplished, and their showcase of three new works by artistic director Iyun Ashani Harrison is a knockout. Most of the dancers have an affiliation with Cornish College of the Arts where Harrison teaches (some are graduates, some still students). All have strong, agile ballet skills which are given an intoxicating Afro-Caribbean twist in ""Artifact,"" a joyous, sassy, intricate homage to what Harrison calls ""the beautiful traditional dances of my childhood in Jamaica."" Local composer-percussionist Ben Morrow penned the dance-propulsive score. Sean Rosado and Sam Picart are reasons alone to catch this while you can.""

<h3>OUT</h3>
<p>OUT is the story of Glen, a 17-year-old who comes out of the closet in Montreal in 1977 at the height of the disco era. Although not yet out to his parents, he learns how to survive in the discos, joins a Gay Youth Group, has awkward romantic entanglements, and then he and his best friends end up at the Gay Pride March in New York City, where their lives are changed forever. There are about twenty-five characters in <i>OUT</i> and they are all played, simultaneously, by Dora Award-nominated actor Greg Campbell. They include Mary Poppins, some of the characters from <i>The Boys In the Band</i>, infamous homophobe Anita Bryant, and one of the Village People!</p>
<p>This show takes place in the early days of gay liberation, and is a hilarious and moving celebration of what it meant to be out in a world that completely shunned LGBTQ people. It is a great way for younger queer people to learn the history of their community, and a visceral reminder for older folks of what it was like when just showing up at a Gay Pride March was an act of courage. It was also the era of hedonism, disco music and fashion, and the beginnings of pride!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Journey</h3>
<p>I wrote OUT because I grew up in the gay discotheques of Montreal, and it was a joyful, golden time that I wanted to commemorate. </p>
<p>It was produced at the Fringe Festival in 2016, and received great reviews. Then the show was picked up by the Best of the Fringe, and was mentioned in the <i>NOW</i> Fringe Wrap-Up as one of four “Best New Plays” of the Fringe. Due to this success, I wanted to remount the play and knew the ideal venue for it was Buddies In Bad Times. They welcomed us as a guest company in their season and I’m thrilled to be presenting the show in the longest-running LGBTQ theatre in North America. This year is Buddies’ 40th anniversary: the theatre began in 1979, and our play is set in 1977, so it couldn’t be produced in a better place or time.</p>

<p>Adam Barrett - Projections Designer</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Expenses</h3>
<p>We got partial funding, from the Canada Council, but are still far short of the total we need to put on this show. I am producing this show mostly by myself. I am looking for ways to finance the show, while assisting with the social media campaign, rehearsing the play, and all the while working my day job. If we don’t reach our target, we will put whatever donations we get to good use in getting the show on stage.</p>
<p>We need money to pay the six artists and designers a union wage for the four weeks of rehearsal and performance. This is our biggest cost, around $12,000. The rental of the theatre costs about $3300. Rehearsal spaces will cost at least $750, and advertising and social media will be about $1000.</p>
<p>Any donation you can give will be of great benefit to the production of this show, and everyone involved in it. If everyone put in $5, we would reach our goal in no time! Plus check out the perks with each amount!</p>

<p> - Extend artistic offerings to non-profit organizations devoted to assisting caregivers, persons with disabilities and their families</p>
<p>  - Provide accessible, affordable theater to a wide audience in the DC community (under $20)</p>
<p>- Be able to fully compensate all  the artists/designers/directors working on this project and purchase needed materials.</p>
<p>Past production partnerships demonstrate Convergence Theatre's commitment to community engagement and social justice. Partners such as Domestic Violence Resource Project and Stop Modern Slavery DC were just two organizations that joined with Convergence to activate theater outside the performance.  For <i>This is All Just Temporary</i>, Convergence continues to extend performance into practice, making it possible for everyone to be an active force for change by providing activities and resources. We are excited to be joining forces with the following organizations through our production: </p>
<p>The Arc of the District of Columbia</p>
<p>The Arc of Northern Virginia</p>
<p>Breaching the Fourth Wall</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Hello, welcome, and thank you for visiting our fundraising campaign!  </h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong>About Kelsey Bergstrom Young (Director/Choreographer)</strong></u></h3>
<p>The arts have been the very air I have breathed since birth.  The daughter of a musician and a poet, educated in arts magnet schools, I took to the embodied performing arts by age ten.  I was performing professionally in the theatre by age 11, and by high school was choreographing and directing while singing, dancing, and acting my heart out.  I have a BA in Theatre Arts and Literature from New York's Sarah Lawrence College, and am a short six months (and this project!) away from earning my MFA in Dance:  Creative Practice.  Between my two degrees I took a hiatus from performing, and devoted myself entirely to a prodigiously successful career in the culinary arts.  Art has been my life!</p>
<p>This broad exposure in the realm of expression, and the interdisciplinary nature of my own artistic identity, places me in a unique position to create innovative processes as well as products.</p>
<h3><u>Our Project</u></h3>
<p>I am working with a cast of seven brilliant performers, creating a new process of art-making that walks the line between acting, dance, and personal transformation.  This work will be presented in two performances, a short excerpt at Napa's Lincoln Theatre on January 27, 2017, and in its 30-minute entirety at the first MFA in Dance Festival at Saint Mary's College, on June 17 and 18, 2017.  But this work reaches far beyond these two performances.</p>
<p>This is the work that my entire life has been leading me to do-- yes, making original work to perform and share, but this work is really exploring the potential that artistic process has to heal and transform both he who enacts it, and he who bears witness.  This work takes the disciplines of art, dance, and somatic therapies, traditional dance and acting techniques, creative writing, and improvisation to forge a new path in art-making, and we hope, to reach our audience in new and meaningful ways.  </p>
<p>Your support will provide the means to take our work from the studio and place it on the stage, as well as extend the reach of this creative process to include designers in lighting, costume, sound, and set, as well as the composition of original music.  Most importantly, your support will reimburse our incredible performers for their 10 month devotion to this project and process.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<u>Even if we do not reach our fundraising goal</u>,</h3>
<p>every penny that we do raise will be instrumental in actualizing this project.  </p>
<p>Here's a clear break-down of how the stated $8,000. fundraising goal will be used!</p>
<p>- Costume design and construction</p>
<p>- Lighting design</p>
<p>-Original musical composition</p>
<p>-Set design</p>
<p>-Expense reimbursement for cast of seven</p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p>The successful completion of this project will accomplish so much more than earning me my MFA-- although that is no small thing!  It acts as a major stepping stone on my road to actualizing my purpose in this world, which is to bring more art to more people, to shine light in the dark-- but most importantly, to empower people that by engaging in the creative process, they have the power to shine that light themselves.</p>
</div><div><h3><u>Other ways to help!</u></h3></div><div> </div><p>If you are not in a position to pledge financial support, it would be instrumental to our success if you share this campaign with anybody who you think might wish to help!  </p></div>","Hello, welcome, and thank you for visiting our fundraising campaign!

Your support will provide the means to take our work from the studio and place it on the stage, as well as extend the reach of this creative process to include designers in lighting, costume, sound, and set, as well as the composition of original music.  Most importantly, your support will reimburse our incredible performers for their 10 month devotion to this project and process.


Even if we do not reach our fundraising goal,
every penny that we do raise will be instrumental in actualizing this project.  
Here's a clear break-down of how the stated $8,000. fundraising goal will be used!
- Costume design and construction
- Lighting design
-Original musical composition
-Set design
-Expense reimbursement for cast of seven

The Impact
The successful completion of this project will accomplish so much more than earning me my MFA-- although that is no small thing!  It acts as a major stepping stone on my road to actualizing my purpose in this world, which is to bring more art to more people, to shine light in the dark-- but most importantly, to empower people that by engaging in the creative process, they have the power to shine that light themselves.
Other ways to help! If you are not in a position to pledge financial support, it would be instrumental to our success if you share this campaign with anybody who you think might wish to help!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p></p></div>","Please scroll down for more information about BICT Fest 2016 What is BICT Fest? 
The Bangkok International Children’s Theatre Festival 2016 (BICT Fest) is Thailand’s first international performing arts festival for young people. Our goal is to cultivate creativity, connect cultures, and inspire children through professional theatre works from all over the world. BICT Fest will also provide a platform for intercultural exchanges for artists and audiences and creative learning programs for young people and their families.
Taking place in the heart of Bangkok at Bangkok Art and Culture Centre (BACC) from June 21–July 3, 2016, BICT Fest aims to become a biannual family event of high-quality performing arts experience. The organizers are Arts on Location and Democrazy Theatre Studio in partnership with BACC and The Japan Foundation, Bangkok. 

Why now? 
Thailand’s unstable economy and volatile politics make it more important now than ever that children in this country can participate in experiential learning outside the classroom. Space for freedom of expression is essential to human development, including to the growth of young minds, their character, and beliefs. We believe that theatre provides this space where learning can trigger the imagination and help children grow into curious and creative individuals with an understanding of themselves and empathy for others. As audience members, children are engaged physically, mentally, and emotionally as they experience lives and stories different from their own.

“At BICT Fest, children will be encouraged to grow up inspired by the diversity of life’s experiences and to see the world from different perspectives through theatre.”

</p><p>Hi! I’m Lauren, a New York-based writer and actor. My one-woman show: “Lauren White
Wants You!” has been selected to be a part of the 2014 United Solo Festival.
This is the first time I’ll be performing my own work in New York, which is

original inspiration for the show came when I was studying abroad and started
speaking with people that were very vocal about politics but didn’t vote. I was
interested in the seeming disconnect between belief and action. I found that
the overwhelming response from people who had chosen not to vote was that they
felt their one vote could never make any kind of real difference in the world. Therefore,
I wanted to create a show that would demonstrate the immediate effect that a
person’s actions could have on a community and other people’s lives.</span></p>
<p><b>Why

</p><h2><b>THE BACKSTORY</b></h2>
<p>Simply put, this
production stems from a place of love and the need to create theatre. It
was born out of a group of artists known as The Fishbowl Collective. In
December of 2012, Muhlenberg College alumni founded this Collective, a group
that serves as a resource for current and future alumni to network and develop
new work. In one year we have grown to over 400 members. This past fall, we

An understudy rehearsal for the Broadway premiere of Kafka's undiscovered masterpiece. One afternoon to get it right. There's just one problem - nothing goes right.See how the existentialism of Franz Kafka and the intangibility of theatre collide in Theresa Rebeck's hilarious comedy, The Understudy.
The show must go on...right?WELCOMEGreetings Friends,
Family, Colleagues, and Indiegogo Browsers,
Welcome to our
campaign. We are raising funds for a production of Theresa Rebeck’s The Understudy. This three-person comedy
is going up at The Secret Theatre in Long Island City, Queens from
May 28 through June 1. Follow us on Twitter, and visit our website here!
You can help make this
show happen!
THE BACKSTORY
Simply put, this
production stems from a place of love and the need to create theatre. It
was born out of a group of artists known as The Fishbowl Collective. In
December of 2012, Muhlenberg College alumni founded this Collective, a group
that serves as a resource for current and future alumni to network and develop
new work. In one year we have grown to over 400 members. This past fall, we
presented our second InstaConcert, a night of first drafts. Participants
rehearsed four to six hours and then performed their work. A few of us put up a scene from The
Understudy. It was only five minutes long, but we could not get enough of
it. Ultimately we decided to put up a production of our own and create our own opportunities. We couldn’t be more excited to share it with you in May.THE FOLKS INVOLVED

<p><i>Asylos </i>is a theater company that creates devised, multi-media immersive performance by a wonderfully wacky and compelling ensemble that likes to take their audience members on scenic detours to share a quirky anecdote or ask a few questions, with offerings of fruit, pies and perhaps even a boozy beverage.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439312090/andducm7nyeueuunuhmj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Asylos </i>is committed to creating non-traditional theater experiences that challenge the rules and confines of viewing theater, thus engaging an audience in an altogether unique and wondrous journey. </p><p>Company members include: Teresa Braun, Elisa Marti, Amanda Rothman, Virginia Rupert and Yael Shavitt. </p>
<p>The seeds of <i>Asylos </i>were planted back in June of 2012 when artistic director G.J. Dowding embarked on his first directorial journey with his original work, <i>Quizzically Quimsical. </i>The magical chemistry that was born of that show has kept a core group of artists working together on highly movement based material steeped in poetry and prose. From original work, to the words of Bob Dylan, to now Sylvia Plath, <i>Asylos </i>is bursting out beyond the wings of a theater.</p>
<p>Immersive theater is a very exciting venture right now. We are looking to continue to stretch the limits of immersive theater and to further expand upon what is possible. It is such an exciting and challenging experience!</p>
<p>Which brings us to our campaign! </p>
<p>The minimum funding we need is $4,000. Here is where it goes:</p>
<p>-We will be able to pursue becoming a registered non-profit organization. This requires hiring a lawyer and paying some cold hard cash. As a registered non-profit we will be able to confidently pursue grants and fellowship opportunities that could continue to expand our company and its involvement with local NYC artists and the surrounding community.                                                                                                                    <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">-We will be able to set up a business bank account that will help to further us as a serious and committed company.                                                                                                  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">-We will be able to set up methods of  compensation for our wonderfully invested and talented company members.                                                                                                   -As a company, we will be able to have funding for rehearsal space for our work.                                                                                                                                                               -MARKETING: It will allow us to fully fund the means to maintain our website, our company email account, purchase business cards, create a company logo.                                                                                                                -We will also have the opportunity to enter our current production, <i>Out Of The Ash,</i> with some seed money.</span></p>

</div>","Asylos is a theater company that creates devised, multi-media immersive performance by a wonderfully wacky and compelling ensemble that likes to take their audience members on scenic detours to share a quirky anecdote or ask a few questions, with offerings of fruit, pies and perhaps even a boozy beverage.


Asylos is committed to creating non-traditional theater experiences that challenge the rules and confines of viewing theater, thus engaging an audience in an altogether unique and wondrous journey. Company members include: Teresa Braun, Elisa Marti, Amanda Rothman, Virginia Rupert and Yael Shavitt. 
The seeds of Asylos were planted back in June of 2012 when artistic director G.J. Dowding embarked on his first directorial journey with his original work, Quizzically Quimsical. The magical chemistry that was born of that show has kept a core group of artists working together on highly movement based material steeped in poetry and prose. From original work, to the words of Bob Dylan, to now Sylvia Plath, Asylos is bursting out beyond the wings of a theater.
Immersive theater is a very exciting venture right now. We are looking to continue to stretch the limits of immersive theater and to further expand upon what is possible. It is such an exciting and challenging experience!
Which brings us to our campaign! 
The minimum funding we need is $4,000. Here is where it goes:
-We will be able to pursue becoming a registered non-profit organization. This requires hiring a lawyer and paying some cold hard cash. As a registered non-profit we will be able to confidently pursue grants and fellowship opportunities that could continue to expand our company and its involvement with local NYC artists and the surrounding community.                                                                                                                    -We will be able to set up a business bank account that will help to further us as a serious and committed company.                                                                                                  -We will be able to set up methods of  compensation for our wonderfully invested and talented company members.                                                                                                   -As a company, we will be able to have funding for rehearsal space for our work.                                                                                                                                                               -MARKETING: It will allow us to fully fund the means to maintain our website, our company email account, purchase business cards, create a company logo.                                                                                                                -We will also have the opportunity to enter our current production, Out Of The Ash, with some seed money.
Out Of The Ash is an immersive, multi-media show that will perform at Glasshouse ArtLifeLab (glasshouseproject.org) in Brooklyn this coming fall (September 24-26 and October 1-3). The show is set to text by Sylvia Plath with a script by artistic director, G.J. Dowding.

This show has been in rehearsal since for over 6 months now. The level of commitment and passion the company has brought to the process has been astounding. Out Of The Ash recently performed a work-in-progress at the HOT! Festival at Dixon Place. It was during that process that Asylos was invited to build an immersive experience at Glasshouse ArtLifeLab. 
The seed money we hope to fundraise for this coming production will pay for the following:
-Lighting Designer                                                                                                                                -Sound Designer                                                                                                                                    -Video Designer                                                                                                                                     -Performers (Our 5 company members and 2 additional 'house guests')                        -Costume and set pieces                                                                                                                    -Food and drink that will be consumed by the performed and offered up to the audience throughout the show.                                                                                                                  -MARKETING: Creating postcards, flyers and posters to help spread the word about the show.

<div>Hello! We are Fracture Theatre Co.

<div>The show originally premiered Off-Broadway at the American Theatre of Actors in 2001, it transferred to Broadway later that year.

With that in mind, we see this as the perfect time to revive <i>Urinetown</i>. Keeping the show's wit and humor intact, we want to not just explore these issues but make a statement for meaningful change.

""A solid and engaging immersive murder mystery from a young company with clear potential.""All Edinburgh Theatre

""A tentative audience morphed into vocal, argumentative interrogators and a set of fantastic actors managed to stay utterly in character, even when the detective limelight was not shone on them.""FOUR STARSThree Weeks
""What’s particularly impressive is the considerable dexterity required from the actors to make this kind of immersive theatre work. The cast have to negotiate the environs of a small pub and verbally cajole audience members in the right direction. In this case it really comes off. Interjections and interventions arrive just in time, moving the plot forwards and providing the audience with prompts that lead them to discover certain objects and bring them closer to the truth.""FOUR STARSA Younger Theatre


Who is on board?With a huge amount of other shows at this years festival, we are confident that Eden Gate will stand out and above the rest as we are able to already boast a brilliant list of innovative creatives that are involved with the show's creation. With many years of experience in theatre the team are ready to take on the show!Director: Leonie Rae Gasson (Buzzcut Festival, New Works Festival, Supporting Wall, Misshapen Theatre)Dramaturg: Melanie Phillips (Greenwich and Docklands Festival, LIFT, Summerhall, Lyric Hammersmith, Barbican Centre, National Theatre)Designer: David Doyle (NSFD Emerging Artist, NSDF Commendation for Lighting Design, Dublin Fringe Festival, C Nova)Producer: Harriet Bolwell (Gate Theatre, Cottiers Theatre, The Tramway, SWG3, Theatre Basel)

If you want to help us in our campaign to help fund Eden Gate we can't thank you enough. It's because of people like you that we are able to keep pushing the boundaries of theatre and questioning it as an art form in order to create new and exciting work for audiences everywhere. 
But we can't do this on our own. If you've become a supporter then please, do whatever you can to help publicise this campaign and share this Indiegogo page via the Indiegogo sharing tools. Tell your friends, your family, your neighbours, the cashier in the supermarket, the train attendant, your hairdresser, the person next to you at the hairdressers. Who ever you can tell!

The Pulp Stage is a non-profit theatre company based out of Portland, Oregon. For over six years, we have been providing intimate, live storytelling for fans of science fiction, fantasy and suspense.
Running on countless hours of volunteer time, we are building a dream: to provide communities with scripts that are
1) accessible to performers.
2) irresistible to audiences.
 
ABOUT YOUR DONATION

Now, let's stay transparent. Anyone can throw an e-book onto Amazon for $0...

</h3> <p></p>The Long Tides is a new devised physical theater piece that explores themes around time, with inspiration from Ted Talks, corporate seminars, and advances in physics. The piece is told through the lens of intrepid call center worker Joann Merriweather. Tasked with leading her co-workers in a time management seminar, Joann must look at how she spends her own time, and how her minutes add up. Weaving together clown, movement, audience participation and narrative, The Long Tides is at turns both comic character sketch and poignant audit of how we spend our minutes--and what happens in the moments that stand out.<br/><br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Who You're Supporting</h3>
<b>Nicole Quenelle</b> (that's me!) is an interdisciplinary, independent theater artist focused on physical approaches to writing, devising, character, and ensemble building for original theater and film projects. Currently based in Philadelphia, she spent 10 years performing with regional theater companies in her hometown of 
Durham, North Carolina before training in Lecoq-based physical theater 
in Florence, Italy. She was a company member of  Durham, NC’s Little 
Green Pig for seven years, with which she performed and collaborated on 
many original works and adaptations--originating with the Bard, Beckett,
 Dostoyevsky, Goethe, and others--and transforming them into reimagined 
works by the company in traditional theater spaces and site-specific 
locations. The Long Tides is her first full-length self-produced work since completing a graduate level physical theater program in Italy. More info: nicolequenelle.com<br/><br/>I'm also lucky to be working with some talented designers on <i>The Long Tides:<br/></i><b>Michael Lambui - Lighting Designer<br/>Brad Pouliot - Sound Designer<br/></b>Brad and Michael are both recent graduates of University of the Arts here in Philly. We are working in a studio space that has <i>no light or sound infrastructure</i>, so their work on The Long Tides will be a highly creative pursuit to help me rig creative, beautiful, and affordable lighting and sound design to augment this piece. I am thrilled to have them on this project, and hope that their work with this piece will help them continue to build their already impressive design portfolios. <br/><br/>I'm also very excited to be working with a writing consultant and a few outside eyes -- artists whose work I respect enormously. I'm confident they will help me realize a strong vision for this piece and I'm humbled and grateful to be working with them. Those discussions are still in the works, but I hope to shout out their names very soon! <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; The Impact Of Your Contribution<br/>
</h3> <p></p>Development of The Long Tides to date has been supported by a gratis residency 
at Drop Forge &amp; Tool in Hudson, NY and generous contribution of 
rehearsal space from FringeArts in Philadelphia. But aside from this support, I have been working on a shoestring, first-time-self-producing artist's budget.<b> <br/><br/><i>I'm now in the final, most rigorous, and most important stage of the development--the final two months before the show premiers in the Philadelphia Fringe Festival--and monetary support is more important than ever. Your contribution will help me pay for:</i><br/></b><ul>
<li>Fringe Festival registration fees</li>
<li>Liability insurance</li>
<li>Artist fees <i>(this is perhaps the most important thing on this list -- it's very important to me that I'm able to pay the artists I'm working with for their time and talent, and secondarily reimburse myself for my own expenses)</i><br/>
</li>
<li>Printing of publicity materials</li>
<li>Set, costume and prop materials</li>
<li>Lighting and sound equipment</li>
<li>Photography and videography</li>
<li>Processing fees for this crowdfunding campaign<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<br/>Risks &amp; Challenges<br/>
</h3>There's an enormous amount of work that goes into self-producing beyond the creative part of what you end up seeing. If you're a regular arts patron, chances are, this is not news to you. But the point is, the more I can raise toward my financial goal, the more I can focus on the creative part of making this piece, which is so critical to realizing a strong creative vision of what I offer. I am enormously grateful for any contribution you can make that will help me meet this goal.  <br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>
<br/>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>We're also looking for volunteers to get involved with the production. I could use a hand with:<br/><ul>
<li>Distribution of show postcards and other publicity materials<br/>
</li>
<li>Box office volunteers (taking tickets before shows)</li>
<li>Finding/making props and set pieces</li>
</ul>

Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can't help out with a monetary donation, you can still help spread the word about our company and our upcoming production of ""The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee!""  Like us on Facebook and follow us on Instagram and make sure to share our campaign with #ATC25in25.
We look forward to continuing to provide summer musical theater for Philadelphia in the coming years and can't wait for what's next to come for Avenue Theater.Thanks!Kelly, Anna, Wesley, Chloe & Danielle

<h3>Season 13 Will Be Better Than Ever</h3>
<p><i>The Other Place</i> by Sharr White is a sharp-tongued, fast-paced, witty, powerhouse of a drama — one perfectly suited for Chimera Productions’ 13th season. Juliana is an accomplished scientist on the precipice of a revolutionary discovery that could help thousands of people and make her very wealthy. She is also contemplating divorce, trying to connect with her estranged daughter Laurel (who ran off with Juliana’s doctoral assistant), and desperate to make it through this last big pitch to her restless investors. It might all work out if she can just manage to focus on the next slide.</p>
<p>Directed by Drew Griffiths &amp; Jeffrey Alan Davis</p>

<p><strong>About Chimera Productions</strong></p>
<p>Chimera Productions was founded by a group of artists who produce plays solely for their artistic merit. Why Chimera Productions? A Chimera is an imaginary monster comprised of incongruous parts; an illusion or fabrication of the mind; something that is fantastically visionary, improbable or the product of an unchecked imagination.</p>
<p>The company’s goal is to only produce work that is interesting, enlightening, and not often seen; to explore the power of theater, and the bond between artist and live audience. The Other Place is our 13th consecutive production at the Arts Council of Princeton.</p>

<h2>What's In It For You</h2>
<p>YOU GET THE BEST SEATS IN THE HOUSE!<br/>Almost every perk comes with PREFERRED SEATING for one of the three performances.</p>

<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>Who are we?</p>
<p>Trina is a girl who serves at a pub and studies psychology and mentors women in prison and writes rap songs for her best friends and is genuinely funny and likes driving in her car.</p>
<p>Sam is a girl who serves at a pub and sees her psychologist regularly and teaches her friends to swim and reads a lot and blushes often, sometimes just because someone is looking at her.</p>
<p>We’re running this campaign because we really want to Fringe together, and not just as servers at the bar all the Fringers frequent. We have a story we're really excited to tell and we want to tell it this summer as a Fringe show.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where you come in:</h3>
<p>We need some funds to help us put a great show together and to help cover the cost of taking our show on the road to Winnipeg. It would be much more financially manageable if we were just doing the show in Edmonton, where we live, but we really want to do the show in Manitoba too, as that's where Sam hails from. Taking the necessary time off work, travel expenses, and venue and equipment rentals are all going to add up.</p>
<h3>Perks:</h3>
<p>If you do fund us, we’ve got a multitude of fun, creative, substantial perks to offer you in return. Any little bit helps (really!) and we’ll show our appreciation by sending you things like t-shirts, poems and stories, portraits, tickets to the show, and cookies! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why we think our show is important:</h3>
<p>We like to talk about mental health whenever possible in an effort to destigmatize the ways in which we all suffer, and to make it easier for people to leap over that barrier and seek help if/when they need it. Using the Fringe as a platform to talk about mental health isn’t new but we do think our show is a valuable contribution to the overall conversation. We believe mental health care should be much more accessible than it is, and our show is our own small way of offering up some legitimate help while still being a good time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The current challenge:</h3>
<p>We applied for both the Edmonton and Winnipeg Fringes, and sadly we didn’t win either of the lotteries, which means we now have more work to do! In both cities we have to find and book venues, hire technicians to help us out, and rent equipment to pull it all off.</p>
<p>This is exactly what we were crossing our fingers against, but it’s cool, we can do it! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Vampires don't play by the rules. Pan-sexual &amp; alternative, vampires push boundaries and literally take a bite out of life. As such, our three concerts for Mythos will challenge expectations of attraction and desire. At each performance the lead roles of Mythos will be cast to explore different manifestations of love, lust and power: Traditional, Alternative and LGBTQ+.</p>
<p>Thu, Aug 2nd @ 6:00 p.m. - Traditional casting</p>
<p>Fri, Aug 3rd @ 7:00 p.m. - Alternative casting (talk-back following concert)</p>
<p>Sat, Aug  4th @ 3:00 p.m. - LGBTQ+ casting (talk-back following concert)</p>
</div>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Heather Jopling (Librettist) and David Velarde (Composer) collaborated to create Mythos: The Crimson Chorus - an original vampire rock opera.</p>
<p>Heather got the theatre bug when she was 11 years old. She debuted in The Sound of Music at Kingston Elementary School, having worked her way from Ensemble Nun to Major Nun, Understudy to Brigitta, Brigitta and then finally Louisa (while still retaining Brigitta's big scene with Maria). Through her subsequent decades, Heather has written and directed plays, founded a Shakespeare company, created diversity-friendly children's books, written deliciously trashy romance novels and been a surrogate mother for gay fathers.</p>
<p>When David was 5 years old, he already knew all the songs of Sound Of Music, West Side Story and Seven Brides For Seven Brothers by heart. By the 8th grade, David had become an orphan in Oliver. Having graduated from Carnegie Mellon University's Classical Voice program, David has gone on to perform lead roles for Broadway and European tours and also on TV. David’s musical, Autumn Moon, ran Off-Broadway in 2006. Mythos: The Crimson Chorus is David’s third musical theatre composition. </p>

Who we are
Heather Jopling (Librettist) and David Velarde (Composer) collaborated to create Mythos: The Crimson Chorus - an original vampire rock opera.
Heather got the theatre bug when she was 11 years old. She debuted in The Sound of Music at Kingston Elementary School, having worked her way from Ensemble Nun to Major Nun, Understudy to Brigitta, Brigitta and then finally Louisa (while still retaining Brigitta's big scene with Maria). Through her subsequent decades, Heather has written and directed plays, founded a Shakespeare company, created diversity-friendly children's books, written deliciously trashy romance novels and been a surrogate mother for gay fathers.
When David was 5 years old, he already knew all the songs of Sound Of Music, West Side Story and Seven Brides For Seven Brothers by heart. By the 8th grade, David had become an orphan in Oliver. Having graduated from Carnegie Mellon University's Classical Voice program, David has gone on to perform lead roles for Broadway and European tours and also on TV. David’s musical, Autumn Moon, ran Off-Broadway in 2006. Mythos: The Crimson Chorus is David’s third musical theatre composition.

<h3>Founding Members:</h3>
<p>Bella Poynton (Artistic Director and Resident Playwright), Ariel Francoeur (Producing Artistic Director and Resident Director) and Melina Neves (Literary Manager and Resident Actor) met at the University of Iowa, and decided that their mutual passion for science fiction, feminist thought, and amazing theatre was too great to ignore! The company was formed in 2014. Since then we have produced over 50 short science fiction plays with feminist themes.</p>

<p>Since their inception, The Navigators have produced:</p>

<h3>Why We Need A Mid-Season Boost</h3>
<p>This season has been fantastic--our best yet! We've produced our first full scale production, and the Third Annual Lift-Off Series of New Science Fiction Plays. This spring, we are partnering with the Long Island City Artists (LIC-A) at the Plaxall Gallery in LIC to bring you three brand new commissioned one-act sci-fi plays, which will be presented in the same space as brand new commissioned Sci-fi visual art. But towards the end of the season, things can get tough. This small boost will help pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costumes for the Three Commissioned One Acts</li>
<li>Prop accessories for the Three Commissioned One Acts</li>
<li>Projection Design</li>
<li>Audition and rehearsal space.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to assure all of our collaborators, partners, and fans that our Commissioned One Acts as well as the 4th Annual Lift-Off Festival will go on as planned with or without this boost--we do not plan on stopping!  However, this small amount of aid will help us a great deal, and allow us to give the upcoming One-Acts the resources and attention they deserve. </p>
