So money is tight in my family. My parents a currently divorced and my dad doesn’t pitch in that much money for my siblings and me. And my mom is at a job where she doesn’t make that much money to support all of us all the time. My dad pays her each month a small amount for child support but that is over in a few months when my younger sister turns 18.</p>
<p>My campaign is currently to raise money so I can go buy a gaming desktop for my brother. He love playing video games and wants to study game editing in college. But since money is tight in my family he hasn’t been able to get one. He has been my role model since I was a little boy since my parents got divorced. That is why I have decided to start collecting money so I can buy him one. I feel that this is my way of thanking him for all he has done to help raise me with our mom.<br/><br/>Contributing anything to my campaign will mean a lot to not only to me but also to my brother. And anyone who does contribute will receive a personal thank you from the two of us.</p>
<p>As of right now I need £2000 to buy him a gaming desktop. I have been putting whatever money I have gotten in the 6 months into this fund for him. I didn’t ask a lot for Christmas and my birthday was a few weeks ago and the money I received from relatives has been put into this. If in the time I have set for this campaign that I don’t receive the £2000 I will use whatever money I have collected to buy a different gaming desktop that I can afford to buy him. And if my goal is reached in this time and more is made I will give whatever amount is to my brother.</p>
<p>Having this campaign goal realized will mean that my brother will be able to start his path onward towards a career in the gaming community. He is limited to what he can do because right now he is using our old family laptop from 2006. It is slow and is just an over all poor laptop.</p>
<p>If you read this and know you cant contribute to my campaign that’s okay. But if you know anyone that is able to, let him or her know of my campaign. Every penny will be appreciated.</p></div>","Hi my names Chris. I am a first year college my local community college. I am one of three kids that are currently in school.

</div>
<div>
<h3>A Quick Intro</h3>
<p>We have been working on the development of eOur World, a Society Simulation Game. However where we lack is in funding and the development can't go further.</p>
<p>Our game website that you can check out is <a href=""http://eourworld.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Social Strategy Game"">www.eourworld.com</a>.</p>
<p>We have been fleshing out the idea of this game for a long time.</p>
<p>That is why we have decided to start this project to fund the development for the eOurWorld, and we need your help!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What is eOurWorld?</h3>
<p>In short, it is a Society Simulation Game playable in browser with a game story that starts in the near future of earth, roughly in the 2100 year. Based on the evolution of the game story the action of the game take place in our times. Below you can read the story and find out why.</p>
<p>In a distant future humanity evolved so much that was able to transfer human consciousness and knowledge into robotic bodies. The differences between humans and human robots were too big. Not long after that the war started. Both sides used mass destruction weapons. All died in this war. A scientist created in secret a virtual world identical with the destroyed one. The consciousness of all who died in the war was transferred in the virtual world machine. No one remembers who they were in the past. The new world became OUR WORLD. <br/>Will you make the same mistakes?</p>
<p>Our World is a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) playable in your browser. The game will involve players working together to decide the future of the world they live in. Some will be businessmen, others military and political leaders. They will work together, and use social strategy to decide the fate of Our World.</p>
</div>

<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>Hiring developers is not cheap. There are many costs associated, including getting concept artists, illustrators and more.</p>
<p>We need to raise $20,000 so we can hire better developers. Being able to get good developers, illustrators, stock photos and more within that budget we'll definitely finish a great game.</p>
<p>Check out the video above for more details, and the perks to the right to see what you'll get in return for helping us out.</p>
<h3>What Happens If We Surpass Our Goal?</h3>
<p>I would love to produce more ingame features and modules, and I would also like to produce a lot more concept and art.</p>
<p>If we do more than $20,000, we will use the excess money to do just that. On average every $1000 - $2000 above our goal will allow us to make and integrate another feature or game module (although it might be more as most of the costs will have already been covered).</p>

<p><strong>Lamentations of the Flame Princess presents Broodmother Sky Fortress by Jeff Rients, illustrated by Stuart Robertson</strong></p>
<p>You know what your crapsack campaign world needs? Giants made out of sharks and elephants, lurking in a haunted house in the clouds, ready to jump out of cyclopean shadows and murder your PCs right in their stupid faces.</p>
<p><strong>About the Author</strong><br/> Jeff Rients received the 1981 Basic D&amp;D box for his eighth birthday and he's never been quite right since. A regular contributor to Fight On! magazine, a fixture at his local nerd conventions and a general purpose weirdo, Jeff is perhaps best known for his long running blog, the imaginatively titled Jeff's Gameblog, where his greatest contributions to the hobby may be rules for getting your PC into trouble while drunk or his theory that all RPGs are Retro, Stupid and/or Pretentious.</p>
<p><strong>About the Artist</strong><br/> Stuart Robertson is a game designer and illustrator who has been a fan of weird sci-fi, comic books, monster movies, westerns, roleplaying games and miniatures since the early 1980s. He is the creator of the Weird West RPG and posts artwork at <a href=""http://stuartrobertson.deviantart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://stuartrobertson.deviantart.com</a></p>
<p><strong>About LotFP</strong><br/> LotFP is the publisher of Weird Fantasy Role-Playing, a horror-fantasy tabletop RPG. It is a second-generation retro-clone, which means that adventures compatible with LotFP are also compatible with over a dozen different games. A free no-art PDF version of the LotFP rulebook is available <a href=""http://www.lotfp.com/RPG/uploads/downloads/GrindhouseRulesMagicFree.zip"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.

<p><strong>About the Campaigns</strong></p>
<p>The ""Extras"" aka ""What I Would Do With This"" sheets are each a single A5 sheet written by James Edward Raggi IV advising how he would change an adventure to give it a different sort of twist or fit into his own campaign.</p>
<p>There are risks for choosing bundle options - if the project you chose the bundle options on does not fund, you'd end up with nothing. If fewer than expected adventures fund, you're paying more than you would have by contributing to each adventure individually. Be aware of how you are contributing and what cost/benefit ratio you're willing to risk.</p>
<p>The perks above the single adventure levels are leaps of faith representing a desire to help get things funded and a hope of a better deal - but this is crowdfunding, we cannot guarantee results.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Pembrooktonshire Gardening Society?</strong></p>
<p>That's the LotFP Fan and Discount club. It costs 10€ to join (+23% VAT for EU orders), and you get a 1€ discount on all print products in the LotFP store forever. Sometimes other benefits too, like saving $50 on an exclusive hardcover set in these campaigns. Details on joining the Society <a href=""http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=40&amp;product_id=71"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Where Does the Money Go?</strong></p>
<p>Two-thirds of the money goes to the talent working on the project: The writer, artist, graphic designer, editor. The rest goes towards printing and shipping (and IndieGoGo's fees). The exact figure varies depending on how many of which perks are chosen, but LotFP will not begin making money on these projects until they hit $7000. LotFP's profits will (hopefully) come after the adventures are released and you all start raving about how cool the adventures are so the non-hardcore supporters go for them.</p>
<p><strong>Other Notes</strong></p>
<p><strong>July 10 Update</strong>:<br/> (see the July 10 entry in the Updates tab for more info on these points)<br/> All funded adventures will include a PDF supplement with conversions to the ""OGL 3.PF"" rules system.<br/> A new funding level has been added: The 3.PF Faithful, with all these conversion notes and stats included in their own booklet<br/> New perks and information for The Faithful and Collecting Faithful levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you go in for The Faithful level or above, and that adventure is the only one that funds, you will receive a 100€ coupon for the LotFP store. If only that and one other funds, you will receive a 50€ coupon.</li>
<li>An exclusive 64 page adventure by James Edward Raggi IV. This adventure will never again be printed in this format (only an abridged 32 or 48 page version in the future), only those pledging at the Faithful or Collecting Faithful levels on funded adventures will receive it. There will be no PDF version of this adventure. This adventure does not count against the ones mentioned in the previous bullet point. It will be included in your Collecting Faithful package but will not be a hardcover inside the slipcase.</li>
<li>A booklet with all of the ""How I Would Fit This Into My Campaign"" sheets, with cover art by Zak S (Vornheim, Playing D&amp;D With Porn Stars, etc), will be included with these perks (will not be made as a hardcover for the slipcase).</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Grab Bags, you may choose which adventures you want.<br/> A new perk: ""Retail Support"" has been added<br/> Three random Collector-level contributors on funded projects will get to have a character of their choice drawn by Jez Gordon in a situation from a funded adventure of their choice, with this art appearing in the Extras booklet.<br/> <strong>(end July 10 Update)</strong></p>
<p>It is our intention to go to press in late November/early December. However, with a potential 19 authors and 18 artists involved, someone is likely to be late so the adventures may not ship out until the new year.</p>
<p>Some of the adventures in these campaigns will be for ages 18+ because of (im)mature content, so be aware of that before contributing to any adventures or multi-adventure perks. If you want to double-check whether any individual adventure will be an 18+ affair, leave a note in the comments and we'll get back to you shortly.</p>
<p>Adventure titles are all subject to change although I'll roast the authors' bits if they turn in something ridiculously different than their supplied description.</p>
<p>All prices include first class shipping from Finland, or a tracked parcel if your stuff comes out to over 1kg.</p>
<p>Each adventure is scheduled to be an A5 sized 32 page book and would retail for 10€-13€ ($13.00-$16.00 depending on exchange rates) not including taxes or shipping. The $20 single copy purchase price is the best approximation of the price including first class shipping worldwide but the real amount may or may not match that. Some adventures, depending on the adventure structures, may be more than 32 pages.</p>
<p>Each funded adventure will have a full print run done for distribution.</p>
<p>The author of a funded adventure will get 10% of all money raised above the $7000 mark, and the artist will get 5% of all money raised above that amount, in addition to their agreed-on fees. Additional profits go into the LotFP war chest.</p></div>","IndieGoGo does not allow modification to your pledge and charges you upon pledging.

About the Author Jeff Rients received the 1981 Basic D&D box for his eighth birthday and he's never been quite right since. A regular contributor to Fight On! magazine, a fixture at his local nerd conventions and a general purpose weirdo, Jeff is perhaps best known for his long running blog, the imaginatively titled Jeff's Gameblog, where his greatest contributions to the hobby may be rules for getting your PC into trouble while drunk or his theory that all RPGs are Retro, Stupid and/or Pretentious.
About the Artist Stuart Robertson is a game designer and illustrator who has been a fan of weird sci-fi, comic books, monster movies, westerns, roleplaying games and miniatures since the early 1980s. He is the creator of the Weird West RPG and posts artwork at http://stuartrobertson.deviantart.com
About LotFP LotFP is the publisher of Weird Fantasy Role-Playing, a horror-fantasy tabletop RPG. It is a second-generation retro-clone, which means that adventures compatible with LotFP are also compatible with over a dozen different games. A free no-art PDF version of the LotFP rulebook is available here. For more info hit the LotFP home page or LotFP blog.
This is one of a number of concurrent campaigns underway to get adventures by top talent published for LotFP. The full list:

For more information about this series of campaigns, to discuss contribution strategies, ask questions, or to simply comment about this madness, go to the message board for this campaign series here.
About the Campaigns
The ""Extras"" aka ""What I Would Do With This"" sheets are each a single A5 sheet written by James Edward Raggi IV advising how he would change an adventure to give it a different sort of twist or fit into his own campaign.
There are risks for choosing bundle options - if the project you chose the bundle options on does not fund, you'd end up with nothing. If fewer than expected adventures fund, you're paying more than you would have by contributing to each adventure individually. Be aware of how you are contributing and what cost/benefit ratio you're willing to risk.
The perks above the single adventure levels are leaps of faith representing a desire to help get things funded and a hope of a better deal - but this is crowdfunding, we cannot guarantee results.
What is the Pembrooktonshire Gardening Society?
That's the LotFP Fan and Discount club. It costs 10€ to join (+23% VAT for EU orders), and you get a 1€ discount on all print products in the LotFP store forever. Sometimes other benefits too, like saving $50 on an exclusive hardcover set in these campaigns. Details on joining the Society here.
Where Does the Money Go?
Two-thirds of the money goes to the talent working on the project: The writer, artist, graphic designer, editor. The rest goes towards printing and shipping (and IndieGoGo's fees). The exact figure varies depending on how many of which perks are chosen, but LotFP will not begin making money on these projects until they hit $7000. LotFP's profits will (hopefully) come after the adventures are released and you all start raving about how cool the adventures are so the non-hardcore supporters go for them.
Other Notes
July 10 Update: (see the July 10 entry in the Updates tab for more info on these points) All funded adventures will include a PDF supplement with conversions to the ""OGL 3.PF"" rules system. A new funding level has been added: The 3.PF Faithful, with all these conversion notes and stats included in their own booklet New perks and information for The Faithful and Collecting Faithful levels:

If you go in for The Faithful level or above, and that adventure is the only one that funds, you will receive a 100€ coupon for the LotFP store. If only that and one other funds, you will receive a 50€ coupon.
An exclusive 64 page adventure by James Edward Raggi IV. This adventure will never again be printed in this format (only an abridged 32 or 48 page version in the future), only those pledging at the Faithful or Collecting Faithful levels on funded adventures will receive it. There will be no PDF version of this adventure. This adventure does not count against the ones mentioned in the previous bullet point. It will be included in your Collecting Faithful package but will not be a hardcover inside the slipcase.
A booklet with all of the ""How I Would Fit This Into My Campaign"" sheets, with cover art by Zak S (Vornheim, Playing D&D With Porn Stars, etc), will be included with these perks (will not be made as a hardcover for the slipcase).

For the Grab Bags, you may choose which adventures you want. A new perk: ""Retail Support"" has been added Three random Collector-level contributors on funded projects will get to have a character of their choice drawn by Jez Gordon in a situation from a funded adventure of their choice, with this art appearing in the Extras booklet. (end July 10 Update)
It is our intention to go to press in late November/early December. However, with a potential 19 authors and 18 artists involved, someone is likely to be late so the adventures may not ship out until the new year.
Some of the adventures in these campaigns will be for ages 18+ because of (im)mature content, so be aware of that before contributing to any adventures or multi-adventure perks. If you want to double-check whether any individual adventure will be an 18+ affair, leave a note in the comments and we'll get back to you shortly.
Adventure titles are all subject to change although I'll roast the authors' bits if they turn in something ridiculously different than their supplied description.
All prices include first class shipping from Finland, or a tracked parcel if your stuff comes out to over 1kg.
Each adventure is scheduled to be an A5 sized 32 page book and would retail for 10€-13€ ($13.00-$16.00 depending on exchange rates) not including taxes or shipping. The $20 single copy purchase price is the best approximation of the price including first class shipping worldwide but the real amount may or may not match that. Some adventures, depending on the adventure structures, may be more than 32 pages.
Each funded adventure will have a full print run done for distribution.
The author of a funded adventure will get 10% of all money raised above the $7000 mark, and the artist will get 5% of all money raised above that amount, in addition to their agreed-on fees. Additional profits go into the LotFP war chest.",0.0,0,"9 Campaigns

<h3>About the game</h3>
<p>We've come up with a fabulous new twist on a classic game.</p>
<p>Remember Connect Four?  Of course you do.  However, we've made a few changes to take this game into the mobile age and make it into a turn-based game with friends that you can play on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.</p>
<p><strong>Play four games at the same time, against the same opponent.</strong></p>
<p>Not just one game - four of the blighters!</p>
<p><strong>Starting positions are generated randomly.</strong></p>
<p>Games throw you straight into the action!  Stop wasting time on no-decision moves.</p>
<p><strong>On each turn, you must play in a different column on each game board!</strong></p>
<p>A whole new strategy is required.  This rule will blow your mind!</p>
<p><strong>The first player to get four-in-a-row twice wins.</strong></p>
<p>Avoid long, drawn-out endgames.</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.foursiesgame.com/images/logo-539x234.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<h3>Why these new rules?</h3>
<p>We've played a few turn-based Connect Four games, and they're super dull.  Depending on how fast your opponent reacts, you can spend hours or days waiting for a game to get to an interesting stage.  Then, all too frequently you spend the last twenty turns responding to forced moves, with no real decision to make.  All you can do is block a line so you don't lose.</p>
<p>By picking a random starting position, we remove the tedium of the opening stages.</p>
<p>By making you play in four different columns, we make sure there's a strategic decision to be made on every turn.</p>
<p>By requiring only two lines to win, games are typically decided in 10-15 turns.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Connect Four has been beaten.  There's a perfect strategy that means a skillful player can force a win or draw, depending on which column play begins in.  These variations remove this possibility.</p>
<p>A brand new strategy is required!</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.foursiesgame.com/images/screenshots.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>About the project</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>As well as the sweet setup you saw in the video, we already have a fully working prototype app for iPhone and iPad.  We've playtested it and settled on these rules.</p>
<p>We're close to completing this project.  We just need a final push.</p>
<p>The first batch of graphics has been completed, and they look stunning!  However, there's a second batch needed - extra sparkle and polish we've come up with since the original brief.  We really want to get this into the game, although it wasn't in the game's budget.</p>
<p>We also need to commission new sound effects that suit the style of the game.  We'd underestimated this at first.  To complement the gorgeous artwork, we want some top quality, on-theme sound effects as well as some appropriate background music.</p>
<p>Money contributed will go towards these extra costs to help make sure we don't have to cut any corners in order to launch the game.  Anything beyond this will boost our marketing campaign to help us reach as wide an audience as possible.</p>
<h3>What about the perks?</h3>
<p>Everyone who contributes will get their name in the credits.  Your name in the next big video game! How cool is that?</p>
<p>We're also giving you the opportunity to put your own designs on the game pieces.  Developers - pledge a little more and we'll put your logo on a piece and include some text about your app and a link to download it.</p>
<p>We'll also give you extra in-game coins.  We don't quite know how the game's economy will work yet but your contribution will get you at least four times as many coins as you'd have got if you'd waited to spend the same amount in the game.</p>
<p>If you just can't wait to play it, pledge a little more and get premium beta access.  No waiting, no arguing with us that yes, absolutely, you'll give us feedback after you play the game.  You'll just get early access along with our qualified beta team.  (Of course, we'd still like your feedback!)</p>
<p>Want to meet the team?  Want to meet our <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/lightwoodcats"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">lovely cats</a>?  Look out for special limited quantity perks that we'll be adding soon.  We could be taking you out for dinner, or you could be coming round to try to beat us at Rock Band or show off your Kinect dancing skills.  A fun, if somewhat geeky, time is promised!</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.foursiesgame.com/images/kitties.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What about Android / Windows / other platforms?</h3>
<p>Maybe.  Watch this space for exciting stretch goals if we make the first target :)</p>
<h3>How else can I help?</h3>

On each turn, you must play in a different column on each game board!
A whole new strategy is required.  This rule will blow your mind!
The first player to get four-in-a-row twice wins.
Avoid long, drawn-out endgames.
 
Why these new rules?
We've played a few turn-based Connect Four games, and they're super dull.  Depending on how fast your opponent reacts, you can spend hours or days waiting for a game to get to an interesting stage.  Then, all too frequently you spend the last twenty turns responding to forced moves, with no real decision to make.  All you can do is block a line so you don't lose.
By picking a random starting position, we remove the tedium of the opening stages.
By making you play in four different columns, we make sure there's a strategic decision to be made on every turn.
By requiring only two lines to win, games are typically decided in 10-15 turns.
Furthermore, Connect Four has been beaten.  There's a perfect strategy that means a skillful player can force a win or draw, depending on which column play begins in.  These variations remove this possibility.
A brand new strategy is required!

About the project


As well as the sweet setup you saw in the video, we already have a fully working prototype app for iPhone and iPad.  We've playtested it and settled on these rules.
We're close to completing this project.  We just need a final push.
The first batch of graphics has been completed, and they look stunning!  However, there's a second batch needed - extra sparkle and polish we've come up with since the original brief.  We really want to get this into the game, although it wasn't in the game's budget.
We also need to commission new sound effects that suit the style of the game.  We'd underestimated this at first.  To complement the gorgeous artwork, we want some top quality, on-theme sound effects as well as some appropriate background music.
Money contributed will go towards these extra costs to help make sure we don't have to cut any corners in order to launch the game.  Anything beyond this will boost our marketing campaign to help us reach as wide an audience as possible.
What about the perks?
Everyone who contributes will get their name in the credits.  Your name in the next big video game! How cool is that?
We're also giving you the opportunity to put your own designs on the game pieces.  Developers - pledge a little more and we'll put your logo on a piece and include some text about your app and a link to download it.
We'll also give you extra in-game coins.  We don't quite know how the game's economy will work yet but your contribution will get you at least four times as many coins as you'd have got if you'd waited to spend the same amount in the game.
If you just can't wait to play it, pledge a little more and get premium beta access.  No waiting, no arguing with us that yes, absolutely, you'll give us feedback after you play the game.  You'll just get early access along with our qualified beta team.  (Of course, we'd still like your feedback!)
Want to meet the team?  Want to meet our lovely cats?  Look out for special limited quantity perks that we'll be adding soon.  We could be taking you out for dinner, or you could be coming round to try to beat us at Rock Band or show off your Kinect dancing skills.  A fun, if somewhat geeky, time is promised!

What about Android / Windows / other platforms?
Maybe.  Watch this space for exciting stretch goals if we make the first target :)
How else can I help?



If you can't pledge money, you can still help!  Please consider doing one of the following:

<h2>The Story</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p align=""Left"">The game is set in a world called Hyperborea, which in the early part of its history endured a savage period of unbridled warfare that nearly razed the continent.</p>
<p align=""Left"">There is a reason this state of war existed, a prime mover as it were, a force that promulgated hatred, fear and hostility. We don't find out what it is until much later in the game at the climax, but this force once threatened to destroy all relationships between living creatures in the distant past.</p>
<p align=""Left""><img alt=""Rockwyrm"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476610/pictures/original/20121005224927-rockwyrmframe.png?1349502566"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Beware the Rockwyrm!""/>The guardian of the world of Hyperborea, a minor divinity known as the White Owl and also the Winged Exemplar, knew that he had to do something to counteract the unceasing carnage before there was nothing left worth defending. He came up with a solution ... he approached the Goddess of the Moon and asked her to sacrifice the Moon Clock, also called the ""Metronome Mysterium,"" the clock that kept time for the various lunar phases. This clock would juxtapose the balance of chaos and entropy in Hyperborea with a generous measure of order, law and harmony.</p>
<p align=""Left"">After the goddess of the moon showed the White Owl how to wind the clock, he returned to the land below with it and concealed it deep within the earth, far from the eyes of mortals. Almost as soon as the clock began to keep time, the bloody wars of succession began to recede and were replaced by a loose set of peaceful alliances and territorial restrictions amongst the many races that inhabited the land. Even the martial Naga, the snake people, retreated to a distant tower across the waters and initiated no further wars on the mainland.</p>
<p align=""Left""><img alt=""Black Lich"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476616/pictures/original/20121005225303-lichframe.png?1349502782"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Superpimp of the Cenotaph!""/>The White Owl knew that he had not solved the basic problem, merely thwarted it with a sort of cosmic counterweight. He knew that if the Clock of Fate ever wound down, the wars and violence would return. Being a wise old bird but absentminded, he decided to write the secret of the Clock's location on nine stone tablets and then scatter these tablets throughout the land so that no unworthy spirit would ever find them but he could recover them when he needed them again.</p>
<p align=""Left"">The problem that developed is that the Winged Exemplar was even more absentminded than he realized - after a thousand years, he forgot where he put the tablets. Kind of like putting a string on your finger - then forgetting to look at the finger!</p>
<p align=""Left"">When we begin the game, the Clock of Fate is winding down, the harrowing shadow of war hangs over the continent and the many races have cut off contact with one another or begun engaging in skirmishes over territory and resources. There are cutthroats abroad, sinister conspiracies afoot and bizarre religious cults gaining in numbers.</p>
<p align=""Left""><img alt=""Cave Shroom"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476619/pictures/original/20121005225711-shroomframe.png?1349503030"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Hold your breath!""/>The only hope for Hyperborea of course, is for us to find the nine tablets, discover the secret hiding place of the Metronome Mysterium and wind it once again. The problem is that we are not the only ones seeking the tablets. We are competing with thieves, assassins, spies and well-intentioned busybodies who are also looking for the tablets. If they get the tablets first, we may have to fight everybody and their brother to get them back.<img alt=""Pirates"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476625/pictures/original/20121005230223-pirateframe.png?1349503343"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Scurvy Dog of the Sea!""/></p>
<p align=""Left"">Along the way we'll discover an enormous number of subplots, lessons in Hyperborean history, the underground kingdom of Samhain, demons from another plane of reality, alien bounty hunters, Shelach the Spider Queen and her one-eyed master the Psychopomp, The Ghost City of Gideon, the Soul-Eater Grendel, The Tower of Bahomet and probably have to kill several discount local gods to succeed, as well as a wide array of mythical beasts native to the continent.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What was the original design philosophy behind the game?</h3>
</div>
<h3><em>""CORE PRINCIPLES""</em></h3>
<div>We wrote these down in January 1995 and have referred back to them constantly as the bible in creating the Grimoire universe ...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<img alt=""Bitey Fish Jr."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/477902/pictures/full/20121006211452-fishframe.png?1349583305"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;"" title=""Watch out for bitey fish!""/>The point of this game is to have fun inside a huge, sprawling fantasy adventure that is so immersive it serves as a completely shameless escape from the real world that lasts a long, long time. It should not try to be an action game, an FPS shooter, a puzzle game or a hidden object game. It should stick to being a turn-based 1st person fantasy roleplaying game. Nothing should be calculated for its appeal, rather the acid test is does it make the game more fun and more interesting. Everything else must go.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The game must never look like it was under adult supervision at any point. <img alt=""Knight Hit"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/477903/pictures/full/20121006211523-knightframe.png?1349583330"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 2px;""/>The world of Grimoire will contain many incongruous elements from different aspects of sci-fi, fantasy and even horror. The purpose of this fantasy is to be fantastic in Grimoire. Nothing should be judged worthwhile because of what people say or whether it conforms to any genre. The only requirement is for this world to be true to itself and to the vision of it's author. Whether or not anybody finds it appealing will be determined by the reaction to the game when it is released.</div>
<div>
<p align=""Left"">There must never be anything that can be done at any time during gameplay or anything that can occur that can mess up game logic so badly that the game cannot be completed.</p>
<p align=""Left"">Do not construct linear frames of reference that assume the player has proceeded along one narrow path of events before they arrive at a given cell or generate a particular event. Avoid constructing rails that the player has to follow to advance in the game.</p>
<p align=""Left""><img alt=""The Hood!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476629/pictures/original/20121005230452-hoodframe.png?1349503491"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Bowman for backup!""/>Never enforce solutions of any one puzzle in a predefined way. All puzzles and challenges should have at least one alternative way of being solved. The obstacles to further progression that have only one solution should be in the minority.</p>
<p align=""Left"">The scenario must permit almost any avenue of exploration to be chosen at any time. No challenge should frustrate the player to where they feel obliged to give up. It should be easy to return to any area or puzzle whenever the player desires.</p>
<p align=""Left"">Moral or reasonable behaviour should be encouraged according to the same incentives present in real life but no penalties should ever apply for immoral or destructive behaviour. Each and any style of play should be open and unfettered, restricted only by the natural hazards the player creates for themselves.</p>
<p align=""Left"">A large part of the gameplay and scenario is to be reserved purely for discovery and delight. It should be possible to play the game many times without finding some of the very best treasures, encounters and areas.<img alt=""Wraith"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476632/pictures/original/20121005230727-wraithframe.png?1349503647"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""You can't touch this!""/></p>
<p align=""Left"">The items are to be protected by a lock that forbids their sale if they are critical. An optional configuration should notify the player if they attempt to drop a critical item. Likewise, an item once used for it's intended purpose in a critical regard to completion of the game, if it does not vanish, should then become marked as uncritical and be available to sell for profit or discard at will.</p>
<p align=""Left"">Non-Player opposition characters should not gain access to critical areas and items until the player has opened these routes by exploring those venues. This will keep tensions riding high and make advantages either way seem very marginal. Non-Player characters should not behave in any fashion that indicates that they have any more information than the player about locations, items and solutions to puzzles. The Non-Player AI should operate within the same limitations as the players themselves.</p>
<p align=""Left"">Maps must always be designed with spaces in mind, not merely collections of corridors or tunnels interrupted by rooms. This is the first principle of all good architecture. Think of the way the various spaces relate to each other and what common factors make them all part of the same place.</p>
</div>
<div>
<img alt=""Null Space Demon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/476636/pictures/original/20121005230937-nullframe.png?1349503777"" src="""" style="""" title=""From another world!""/><br/> </div>
<p><strong><big><big>If you're wondering why we claim Grimoire is one of the greatest classic style fantasy roleplaying games ever created, look at this comparison with other classic RPGs and decide for yourself if Grimoire really is the largest, richest, most detailed and complex computer roleplaying game ever made.</big></big></strong></p>

Review Of Grimoire Gameplay On YouTube
Update #1 : Sooper Seekret Teknologee Review
Having self-funded the entire development of the game over the past 17 years out of our own pockets we are now turning to crowdfunding to put the final polish on the game before delivering it to fans worldwide who have been waiting on the game for more than a decade. A pledge to the game will secure you a one-of-a-kind collector's edition of the resulting masterpiece and a guarantee that the completed product will be artistically perfect. Only pledges will get DRM-free copies of Grimoire once it is completed.
Grimoire is a turn-based, 3D, first person perspective roleplaying adventure in 1024x768 256 Color graphics. The 3D step-based engine is pixel perfect and smooth scrolling with zero distortion handcrafted images.

The emphasis in the game is on the story, exploration, discovery, character advancement, puzzle solving, strategic phased combat, treasure hunting, inventory management and interaction with the non-player characters encountered during play.

The Story


The game is set in a world called Hyperborea, which in the early part of its history endured a savage period of unbridled warfare that nearly razed the continent.
There is a reason this state of war existed, a prime mover as it were, a force that promulgated hatred, fear and hostility. We don't find out what it is until much later in the game at the climax, but this force once threatened to destroy all relationships between living creatures in the distant past.
The guardian of the world of Hyperborea, a minor divinity known as the White Owl and also the Winged Exemplar, knew that he had to do something to counteract the unceasing carnage before there was nothing left worth defending. He came up with a solution ... he approached the Goddess of the Moon and asked her to sacrifice the Moon Clock, also called the ""Metronome Mysterium,"" the clock that kept time for the various lunar phases. This clock would juxtapose the balance of chaos and entropy in Hyperborea with a generous measure of order, law and harmony.
After the goddess of the moon showed the White Owl how to wind the clock, he returned to the land below with it and concealed it deep within the earth, far from the eyes of mortals. Almost as soon as the clock began to keep time, the bloody wars of succession began to recede and were replaced by a loose set of peaceful alliances and territorial restrictions amongst the many races that inhabited the land. Even the martial Naga, the snake people, retreated to a distant tower across the waters and initiated no further wars on the mainland.
The White Owl knew that he had not solved the basic problem, merely thwarted it with a sort of cosmic counterweight. He knew that if the Clock of Fate ever wound down, the wars and violence would return. Being a wise old bird but absentminded, he decided to write the secret of the Clock's location on nine stone tablets and then scatter these tablets throughout the land so that no unworthy spirit would ever find them but he could recover them when he needed them again.
The problem that developed is that the Winged Exemplar was even more absentminded than he realized - after a thousand years, he forgot where he put the tablets. Kind of like putting a string on your finger - then forgetting to look at the finger!
When we begin the game, the Clock of Fate is winding down, the harrowing shadow of war hangs over the continent and the many races have cut off contact with one another or begun engaging in skirmishes over territory and resources. There are cutthroats abroad, sinister conspiracies afoot and bizarre religious cults gaining in numbers.
The only hope for Hyperborea of course, is for us to find the nine tablets, discover the secret hiding place of the Metronome Mysterium and wind it once again. The problem is that we are not the only ones seeking the tablets. We are competing with thieves, assassins, spies and well-intentioned busybodies who are also looking for the tablets. If they get the tablets first, we may have to fight everybody and their brother to get them back.
Along the way we'll discover an enormous number of subplots, lessons in Hyperborean history, the underground kingdom of Samhain, demons from another plane of reality, alien bounty hunters, Shelach the Spider Queen and her one-eyed master the Psychopomp, The Ghost City of Gideon, the Soul-Eater Grendel, The Tower of Bahomet and probably have to kill several discount local gods to succeed, as well as a wide array of mythical beasts native to the continent.

 

What was the original design philosophy behind the game?

""CORE PRINCIPLES""
We wrote these down in January 1995 and have referred back to them constantly as the bible in creating the Grimoire universe ...
 

The point of this game is to have fun inside a huge, sprawling fantasy adventure that is so immersive it serves as a completely shameless escape from the real world that lasts a long, long time. It should not try to be an action game, an FPS shooter, a puzzle game or a hidden object game. It should stick to being a turn-based 1st person fantasy roleplaying game. Nothing should be calculated for its appeal, rather the acid test is does it make the game more fun and more interesting. Everything else must go.
 
The game must never look like it was under adult supervision at any point. The world of Grimoire will contain many incongruous elements from different aspects of sci-fi, fantasy and even horror. The purpose of this fantasy is to be fantastic in Grimoire. Nothing should be judged worthwhile because of what people say or whether it conforms to any genre. The only requirement is for this world to be true to itself and to the vision of it's author. Whether or not anybody finds it appealing will be determined by the reaction to the game when it is released.

There must never be anything that can be done at any time during gameplay or anything that can occur that can mess up game logic so badly that the game cannot be completed.
Do not construct linear frames of reference that assume the player has proceeded along one narrow path of events before they arrive at a given cell or generate a particular event. Avoid constructing rails that the player has to follow to advance in the game.
Never enforce solutions of any one puzzle in a predefined way. All puzzles and challenges should have at least one alternative way of being solved. The obstacles to further progression that have only one solution should be in the minority.
The scenario must permit almost any avenue of exploration to be chosen at any time. No challenge should frustrate the player to where they feel obliged to give up. It should be easy to return to any area or puzzle whenever the player desires.
Moral or reasonable behaviour should be encouraged according to the same incentives present in real life but no penalties should ever apply for immoral or destructive behaviour. Each and any style of play should be open and unfettered, restricted only by the natural hazards the player creates for themselves.
A large part of the gameplay and scenario is to be reserved purely for discovery and delight. It should be possible to play the game many times without finding some of the very best treasures, encounters and areas.
The items are to be protected by a lock that forbids their sale if they are critical. An optional configuration should notify the player if they attempt to drop a critical item. Likewise, an item once used for it's intended purpose in a critical regard to completion of the game, if it does not vanish, should then become marked as uncritical and be available to sell for profit or discard at will.
Non-Player opposition characters should not gain access to critical areas and items until the player has opened these routes by exploring those venues. This will keep tensions riding high and make advantages either way seem very marginal. Non-Player characters should not behave in any fashion that indicates that they have any more information than the player about locations, items and solutions to puzzles. The Non-Player AI should operate within the same limitations as the players themselves.
Maps must always be designed with spaces in mind, not merely collections of corridors or tunnels interrupted by rooms. This is the first principle of all good architecture. Think of the way the various spaces relate to each other and what common factors make them all part of the same place.


 
If you're wondering why we claim Grimoire is one of the greatest classic style fantasy roleplaying games ever created, look at this comparison with other classic RPGs and decide for yourself if Grimoire really is the largest, richest, most detailed and complex computer roleplaying game ever made.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Space Bullet was founded by developers who have worked at large game studios and decided it was time to strike out on their own and bring the world truly unique game experiences. We've been working on Signal Ops full time for over a year, but Signal Ops has been a dream of ours for longer than that! Check out our team profiles if you are interested in learning more about the people behind the game.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Signal Ops draws inspiration from classic games such as Commandos, Syndicate, and Deus Ex. We like to call it a multi-perspective shooter. While playing you are able to simultaneously see what your entire squad of agents see. You work for a secretive government agency and lead your field agents from the relative safety of the control room on various espionage missions. Stealing secrets, sabotage, assassination, and all that sort of thing!</p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt=""Screenshot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.space-bullet.com/content/indiegogo/signalops01.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is no corridor shooter. The levels are open and you are free to tackle the objectives in the manner you see fit. The basics of Signal Ops gameplay are:</p>
<ul>
<li>coordinate your agents</li>
<li>manage the radios to keep in contact with them</li>
<li>try not to cause too much of a ruckus or else things will get very difficult</li>
<li>complete your objectives that can be tackled in various ways</li>
<li>shoot your way out of tight jams when necessary</li>
</ul>
<p><img align=""none"" alt=""Screenshot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.space-bullet.com/content/indiegogo/signalops04.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Did we mention that you can play with a friend? Signal Ops supports both local and online cooperative play through the full campaign.</p>Signal Ops will be available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.<br/><p>You can find high res 1080p screenshots on <a href=""http://space-bullet.com/games.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">our website</a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting Signal Ops, you will not only be helping a great new game reach the level of quality it deserves, but you will also be supporting our ability to continue making great games while remaining independent in future. Are you a gamer who laments the fact that no one makes the type of PC games you used to love? Help us fill that void!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3>
<p>Let us break it down for you. Signal Ops has more than a year of work put into it already, and we are deadly determined to finish it. This game will happen funding or not, but without your support we can't afford to put in the extra polish it deserves and make it a truly awesome product.</p>
<p>The funds we raise will be put towards hiring extra help:</p>
<ul>
<li>level artist to ensure all levels are crafted with love<br/>
</li>
<li>vocal talent to bring the characters to life</li>
<li>musician to create a unique dynamic layered soundtrack that reacts to the game<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will enable us to finish a quality product while having a few pennies left to eat some potatoes and milk*.</p>
<p>Any extra funds raised will be used to develop engaging competitive multi-player modes.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We have some wonderful prizes lined up for you folks! Step into our office.</p>
<p>If you donate at least $5 you will have your name immortalized in the credits of the game and have access to a high resolution wallpaper.</p>
<p>At the $10 level, we'll give you all that and a beautiful downloadable digital art book full of concept art from the game.</p>
<p>You thirst for more? For $30 you will get the above rewards and a copy of the game when it is released.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">(all of the levels after $30 include all of the $5, $10, and $30 level rewards)</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>At $50 there are two choices available:<br/></p>
<p>- An extra copy of the game so you and a friend can play together. How sweet.</p>
<p>OR<br/></p>
<p>- Access to the Signal Ops closed beta before the final game is released and also early access to mod tools.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you give $100 you will get a printed copy of the art book. This will look great with your other books. Actually you might want to brush some of the other books aside. We will be making a limited run based on the number of donations. This is a mock-up of what it may look like:<br/></p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt=""Art Book"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.space-bullet.com/content/indiegogo/concept_book.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>At $250, you will receive a 6-inch figure of a character from the game.

But we have a dream of breaking free of our grey corporate cages – bananas be damned! </p><p>It started with weekly tabletop role playing gaming sessions, complete with our 20-siders and plenty of Cheetos and Mountain Dew. We had an idea of creating our own science fiction RPG – and then, we grew up. Over the years, the world of Second Coming was fleshed out with a full ""history"" and the list of universal rules. Once the basic rules and story line were in place – the weekly gaming sessions started back up. It was like old times, except with the addition of babies in playpens, and toddlers running amok amongst the rolls of dice and bouts of laughter. </p><p>Well now we’ve grown up a little bit more. And Second Coming has evolved from a list of rules and damage formulas to a fully realized and published RPG book.  And with your help, we can bring the game that brought us months-long tabletop campaigns to a new reality as a video game for the masses.<br/><br/><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/497614/files/20140409215201-6.JPG?1397105521"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>Snapped before proving that yes - damage occurs when you crash into ships.</p><p><strong>What is Second Coming – The Annakazi Invasion?<br/></strong><br/>The Annakazi Invasion is the first PC game release based on the capital ship and fleet battles that take place in the Second Coming RPG universe timeline. The game will have both online and offline capabilities. A single-player mode will provide a rich storyline that thrusts you into the action of the Annakazi Invasion, battling for the survival of humanity.  The multi-player pits you against your friends in the “historic” capital ship battles of the Annakazi Invasion timeline. Multi-player mode is as versatile as your team mates. Play as a team to locate, strategically subdue, infiltrate and capture the enemy ship’s command bridge – or utilize the “bury ‘em in bodies” tactic to war and try to annihilate the enemy. <br/><br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/497533/files/20140409205706-1.JPG?1397102226"" src="""" style=""width: 475.33px; height: 240px;""/></p><p></p><p><strong>The Player's Role (Single Player)</strong><br/> The player will go through a minimum of 3 campaigns, each with multiple levels/maps. Each campaign, the player will play at least 1 'historical' figure's life, and in most cases, death, during the Annakazi Invasion. The campaigns are comprised of at least 2 battles as well as a connecting story arc. </p><p><strong>Multiplayer</strong><br/> In multiplayer mode, you will have many, if not all, of the maps in the Single Player version. You will also be able to select which Capital Ships to pit against each other. </p><p><strong>The Maps</strong><br/> Each map has several stellar bodies to help or hinder your team's progress. For example, shields and radar on fighters will be reduced/inactive in a dust cloud. Asteroids will help hide your ships from detection. </p><p> Some maps are going to give Humans Areas of Protection. Titan ships are too massive for the scale we are using, so as a balance to the Annakazi, some maps will include one of the Titan ships in the Human fleet. These will give the fleet extra cover and a slight reload of its complement. If the Annakazi can occupy this area unchallenged by humans, the Titan ship will withdraw. </p><p><strong>The Gameplay</strong><br/> In the Single Player mode, you will play through 'Historic' battles in the Annakazi Invasion. It is in first person point of view,and the action is FPS. You will play different characters throughout the game so your role will vary as you progress.  You will be able to go through the interior of the capital ship, get into a gunner bay, or hop into a fighter and fight the enemy.

So – it’s like this: We’re a small group of friends/gamers that work for prominent (Fortune 500) IT companies as their codemonkeys. But we have a dream of breaking free of our grey corporate cages – bananas be damned! It started with weekly tabletop role playing gaming sessions, complete with our 20-siders and plenty of Cheetos and Mountain Dew. We had an idea of creating our own science fiction RPG – and then, we grew up. Over the years, the world of Second Coming was fleshed out with a full ""history"" and the list of universal rules. Once the basic rules and story line were in place – the weekly gaming sessions started back up. It was like old times, except with the addition of babies in playpens, and toddlers running amok amongst the rolls of dice and bouts of laughter. Well now we’ve grown up a little bit more. And Second Coming has evolved from a list of rules and damage formulas to a fully realized and published RPG book.  And with your help, we can bring the game that brought us months-long tabletop campaigns to a new reality as a video game for the masses.Snapped before proving that yes - damage occurs when you crash into ships.What is Second Coming – The Annakazi Invasion?The Annakazi Invasion is the first PC game release based on the capital ship and fleet battles that take place in the Second Coming RPG universe timeline. The game will have both online and offline capabilities. A single-player mode will provide a rich storyline that thrusts you into the action of the Annakazi Invasion, battling for the survival of humanity.  The multi-player pits you against your friends in the “historic” capital ship battles of the Annakazi Invasion timeline. Multi-player mode is as versatile as your team mates. Play as a team to locate, strategically subdue, infiltrate and capture the enemy ship’s command bridge – or utilize the “bury ‘em in bodies” tactic to war and try to annihilate the enemy. The Player's Role (Single Player) The player will go through a minimum of 3 campaigns, each with multiple levels/maps. Each campaign, the player will play at least 1 'historical' figure's life, and in most cases, death, during the Annakazi Invasion. The campaigns are comprised of at least 2 battles as well as a connecting story arc. Multiplayer In multiplayer mode, you will have many, if not all, of the maps in the Single Player version. You will also be able to select which Capital Ships to pit against each other. The Maps Each map has several stellar bodies to help or hinder your team's progress. For example, shields and radar on fighters will be reduced/inactive in a dust cloud. Asteroids will help hide your ships from detection.  Some maps are going to give Humans Areas of Protection. Titan ships are too massive for the scale we are using, so as a balance to the Annakazi, some maps will include one of the Titan ships in the Human fleet. These will give the fleet extra cover and a slight reload of its complement. If the Annakazi can occupy this area unchallenged by humans, the Titan ship will withdraw. The Gameplay In the Single Player mode, you will play through 'Historic' battles in the Annakazi Invasion. It is in first person point of view,and the action is FPS. You will play different characters throughout the game so your role will vary as you progress.  You will be able to go through the interior of the capital ship, get into a gunner bay, or hop into a fighter and fight the enemy. Some missions will have you as a marine boarding the alien ship, while others will have you shooting down fighters and incoming missiles from a gunner bay on the side of a cruiser.   In the Multiplayer, you will have classes based off of the characters in the single player mode. Each capital ship will have a complement of crew, marines and ships to send into battle. You will fight, die and respawn as long as your ship's complement holds up. If you burn through all of your fighters, you have to fall back to the Cruiser. The initial feel of the Multiplayer mode will kind of be like hide and seek. Each ships' radar range is relatively small in comparison to the map. But your Team's cruiser links to all radars of its smaller ships. So you send your smaller ships out to find the enemy, and this expands the team's radar range. You will inevitably run into either the enemy cruiser, or a fleet of fighters from the opposing team. The round ends when one team either destroys the other team's cruiser, or they board and capture it.Ship damage If a cruiser takes too much damage, several things start to happen. Systems in the ship can start malfunctioning or can be completely destroyed. Amongst these, engines, gunner bays, shields, artificial gravity, and O2 supply can be knocked offline. If damage occurs near an external wall of the ship, it can cause a hull breach. This will suck anyone in the general vicinity of the breach out in open space. And then back into respawn.The Mechanics The game is being built on the Unity Engine v4. We need to obtain the licensing for Unity Pro and the Mecanim animation suite.

<p><strong>Lamentations of the Flame Princess presents Towers Two by Dave Brockie</strong></p>
<p>For centuries the province of Gar has been governed by the famously wealthy Family Hune. The mighty “Towers Two” have stood as a symbol of stability and prosperity over a world increasing slipping into chaos. But ever since the difficult birth of the identical twin brothers Rondrel and Zal, a shadow has fallen over the family and the land they had ruled for centuries. The brothers quarreled over the power they had inherited from their father, squandering their wealth, and sending the line into decay. The nearby village of Ham, once happy to call Towers Two and the Family Hune their protectors now live in fear of the fortress and it inhabitantsâ€•a fear born from the outrageous rumors that surround this ancient family and provide ample gossip for the taverns. But how much truth is there to the tales of strange lights that can be seen over the castle, people disappearing from their homes, and bizarre creatures haunting the fringes of the settlements? Just what the hell is happening up there? A group of local merchants wants to know, and are willing to pay to get the answers…</p>

<p><strong>About the Campaigns</strong></p>
<p>The ""Extras"" aka ""What I Would Do With This"" sheets are each a single A5 sheet written by James Edward Raggi IV advising how he would change an adventure to give it a different sort of twist or fit into his own campaign.</p>
<p>There are risks for choosing bundle options - if the project you chose the bundle options on does not fund, you'd end up with nothing. If fewer than expected adventures fund, you're paying more than you would have by contributing to each adventure individually. Be aware of how you are contributing and what cost/benefit ratio you're willing to risk.</p>
<p>The perks above the single adventure levels are leaps of faith representing a desire to help get things funded and a hope of a better deal - but this is crowdfunding, we cannot guarantee results.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Pembrooktonshire Gardening Society?</strong></p>
<p>That's the LotFP Fan and Discount club. It costs 10€ to join (+23% VAT for EU orders), and you get a 1€ discount on all print products in the LotFP store forever. Sometimes other benefits too, like saving $50 on an exclusive hardcover set in these campaigns. Details on joining the Society <a href=""http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=40&amp;product_id=71"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Where Does the Money Go?</strong></p>
<p>Two-thirds of the money goes to the talent working on the project: The writer, artist, graphic designer, editor. The rest goes towards printing and shipping (and IndieGoGo's fees). The exact figure varies depending on how many of which perks are chosen, but LotFP will not begin making money on these projects until they hit $7000. LotFP's profits will (hopefully) come after the adventures are released and you all start raving about how cool the adventures are so the non-hardcore supporters go for them.</p>
<p><strong>Other Notes</strong></p>
<p><strong>July 10 Update</strong>:<br/> (see the July 10 entry in the Updates tab for more info on these points)<br/> All funded adventures will include a PDF supplement with conversions to the ""OGL 3.PF"" rules system.<br/> A new funding level has been added: The 3.PF Faithful, with all these conversion notes and stats included in their own booklet<br/> New perks and information for The Faithful and Collecting Faithful levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you go in for The Faithful level or above, and that adventure is the only one that funds, you will receive a 100€ coupon for the LotFP store. If only that and one other funds, you will receive a 50€ coupon.</li>
<li>An exclusive 64 page adventure by James Edward Raggi IV. This adventure will never again be printed in this format (only an abridged 32 or 48 page version in the future), only those pledging at the Faithful or Collecting Faithful levels on funded adventures will receive it. There will be no PDF version of this adventure. This adventure does not count against the ones mentioned in the previous bullet point. It will be included in your Collecting Faithful package but will not be a hardcover inside the slipcase.</li>
<li>A booklet with all of the ""How I Would Fit This Into My Campaign"" sheets, with cover art by Zak S (Vornheim, Playing D&amp;D With Porn Stars, etc), will be included with these perks (will not be made as a hardcover for the slipcase).</li>
</ul><p>For the Grab Bags, you may choose which adventures you want.<br/> A new perk: ""Retail Support"" has been added<br/> Three random Collector-level contributors on funded projects will get to have a character of their choice drawn by Jez Gordon in a situation from a funded adventure of their choice, with this art appearing in the Extras booklet.<br/><strong>(end July 10 Update)</strong></p>
<p>It is our intention to go to press in late November/early December. However, with a potential 19 authors and 18 artists involved, someone is likely to be late so the adventures may not ship out until the new year.</p>
<p>Some of the adventures in these campaigns will be for ages 18+ because of (im)mature content, so be aware of that before contributing to any adventures or multi-adventure perks. If you want to double-check whether any individual adventure will be an 18+ affair, leave a note in the comments and we'll get back to you shortly.</p>
<p>Adventure titles are all subject to change although I'll roast the authors' bits if they turn in something ridiculously different than their supplied description.</p>
<p>All prices include first class shipping from Finland, or a tracked parcel if your stuff comes out to over 1kg.</p>
<p>Each adventure is scheduled to be an A5 sized 32 page book and would retail for 10€-13€ ($13.00-$16.00 depending on exchange rates) not including taxes or shipping. The $20 single copy purchase price is the best approximation of the price including first class shipping worldwide but the real amount may or may not match that. Some adventures, depending on the adventure structures, may be more than 32 pages.</p>
<p>Each funded adventure will have a full print run done for distribution.</p>
<p>The author of a funded adventure will get 10% of all money raised above the $7000 mark, and the artist will get 5% of all money raised above that amount, in addition to their agreed-on fees. Additional profits go into the LotFP war chest.</p></div>","IndieGoGo does not allow modification to your pledge and charges you upon pledging. Refunds are only given on projects which do not fund; there is no ""oh I changed my mind"" mechanism on this site and the campaign organizers (LotFP in this case) have no control or access to such things.

The brothers quarreled over the power they had inherited from their father, squandering their wealth, and sending the line into decay. The nearby village of Ham, once happy to call Towers Two and the Family Hune their protectors now live in fear of the fortress and it inhabitantsâ€•a fear born from the outrageous rumors that surround this ancient family and provide ample gossip for the taverns. But how much truth is there to the tales of strange lights that can be seen over the castle, people disappearing from their homes, and bizarre creatures haunting the fringes of the settlements? Just what the hell is happening up there? A group of local merchants wants to know, and are willing to pay to get the answers…
About the Author Towers Two is the first professional RPG credit from Dave Brockie, the man better known to the world as Oderus Urungus, lead singer of the legendary shock-metal band GWAR. In addition to playing GWAR’s pig-nosed singer for over 25 years, Brockie is an avid artist and writer whose first novel, the blood-soaked Whargoul, can be found here...
About LotFP LotFP is the publisher of Weird Fantasy Role-Playing, a horror-fantasy tabletop RPG. It is a second-generation retro-clone, which means that adventures compatible with LotFP are also compatible with over a dozen different games.

For more information about this series of campaigns, to discuss contribution strategies, ask questions, or to simply comment about this madness, go to the message board for this campaign series here.
About the Campaigns
The ""Extras"" aka ""What I Would Do With This"" sheets are each a single A5 sheet written by James Edward Raggi IV advising how he would change an adventure to give it a different sort of twist or fit into his own campaign.
There are risks for choosing bundle options - if the project you chose the bundle options on does not fund, you'd end up with nothing. If fewer than expected adventures fund, you're paying more than you would have by contributing to each adventure individually. Be aware of how you are contributing and what cost/benefit ratio you're willing to risk.
The perks above the single adventure levels are leaps of faith representing a desire to help get things funded and a hope of a better deal - but this is crowdfunding, we cannot guarantee results.
What is the Pembrooktonshire Gardening Society?
That's the LotFP Fan and Discount club. It costs 10€ to join (+23% VAT for EU orders), and you get a 1€ discount on all print products in the LotFP store forever. Sometimes other benefits too, like saving $50 on an exclusive hardcover set in these campaigns. Details on joining the Society here.
Where Does the Money Go?
Two-thirds of the money goes to the talent working on the project: The writer, artist, graphic designer, editor. The rest goes towards printing and shipping (and IndieGoGo's fees). The exact figure varies depending on how many of which perks are chosen, but LotFP will not begin making money on these projects until they hit $7000. LotFP's profits will (hopefully) come after the adventures are released and you all start raving about how cool the adventures are so the non-hardcore supporters go for them.
Other Notes
July 10 Update: (see the July 10 entry in the Updates tab for more info on these points) All funded adventures will include a PDF supplement with conversions to the ""OGL 3.PF"" rules system. A new funding level has been added: The 3.PF Faithful, with all these conversion notes and stats included in their own booklet New perks and information for The Faithful and Collecting Faithful levels:

If you go in for The Faithful level or above, and that adventure is the only one that funds, you will receive a 100€ coupon for the LotFP store. If only that and one other funds, you will receive a 50€ coupon.
An exclusive 64 page adventure by James Edward Raggi IV. This adventure will never again be printed in this format (only an abridged 32 or 48 page version in the future), only those pledging at the Faithful or Collecting Faithful levels on funded adventures will receive it. There will be no PDF version of this adventure. This adventure does not count against the ones mentioned in the previous bullet point. It will be included in your Collecting Faithful package but will not be a hardcover inside the slipcase.
A booklet with all of the ""How I Would Fit This Into My Campaign"" sheets, with cover art by Zak S (Vornheim, Playing D&D With Porn Stars, etc), will be included with these perks (will not be made as a hardcover for the slipcase).
For the Grab Bags, you may choose which adventures you want. A new perk: ""Retail Support"" has been added Three random Collector-level contributors on funded projects will get to have a character of their choice drawn by Jez Gordon in a situation from a funded adventure of their choice, with this art appearing in the Extras booklet.(end July 10 Update)
It is our intention to go to press in late November/early December. However, with a potential 19 authors and 18 artists involved, someone is likely to be late so the adventures may not ship out until the new year.
Some of the adventures in these campaigns will be for ages 18+ because of (im)mature content, so be aware of that before contributing to any adventures or multi-adventure perks. If you want to double-check whether any individual adventure will be an 18+ affair, leave a note in the comments and we'll get back to you shortly.
Adventure titles are all subject to change although I'll roast the authors' bits if they turn in something ridiculously different than their supplied description.
All prices include first class shipping from Finland, or a tracked parcel if your stuff comes out to over 1kg.
Each adventure is scheduled to be an A5 sized 32 page book and would retail for 10€-13€ ($13.00-$16.00 depending on exchange rates) not including taxes or shipping. The $20 single copy purchase price is the best approximation of the price including first class shipping worldwide but the real amount may or may not match that. Some adventures, depending on the adventure structures, may be more than 32 pages.
Each funded adventure will have a full print run done for distribution.
The author of a funded adventure will get 10% of all money raised above the $7000 mark, and the artist will get 5% of all money raised above that amount, in addition to their agreed-on fees. Additional profits go into the LotFP war chest.",0.0,0,"9 Campaigns

What is Indomita?




A wild horse simulation game that gives you a chance to play as the characters. It's an attempt at a merger between the worlds of SIM horse games and play by post RPGs.
For the last fifteen years, I've been involved on and off with both communities, more so the RPG side of things. For several years I had been rping in a small, private community and sought to just create us a simple way to generate new foals. One page turned into two pages and before you know it, the first incarnation of Indomita was born. Since then, things have changed significantly and have (hopefully!) gotten even better.




What do we need?



I have been coding the game entirely by myself which has helped move things along however, I have no artistic ability to speak of. The game in its current state is relatively playable with the exception of the very limited amount of art that has been added. The game isn't incredibly heavy on art but it could definitely use some sprucing up and I'd like to get a jump on that before opening things up.
We also have recently suffered some weather related issues that took out the server the game was running on. Thankfully nothing was lost and everything was safely moved over but to be as efficient as we'd like things are going to have to be replaced. 
So funds will cover:

Server upgrades that we've made to ensure that things run smoothly.
Item art for the ever growing list of items characters can encounter and craft in the game.
NPC art for the specific and also generic creatures that can be encountered in battle or otherwise.

Here's a little preview of the horse art we already have for the game. It's in the process of being added in to go with character genetics. Thanks to the wonderful Esnym for this and the banner art!





What can you expect to see in the game?



Our list of features is always growing but at the time of this posting the following game features are live:

<p>It's a business simulator &amp; strategy video game <b>(for Windows, Mac + Linux)</b> about setting up your own start-up; this game aims to entertain and inform players about the real world of business in a fun way.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A
business simulator is a unique subject that is not seen often in
video games. Plus it's also unique in that it will inform about how 
the real world of business works, therefore it will be a great
oportunity to learn about the subject to actual beginning
entrepeneurs and curious people, while they are having fun playing
it.</span><br/></p>
<p>Also
since knowledge is power, it will be a great way to give more power
to people so that they can have more freedom to add value to society
in a positive way.</p>

<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>Why crowdfunding?:<br/>
</h2>
<p>I need to raise money to get together a team of programmers to work full time to complete a playable alpha version in about 5 months, for that I need to raise 20,000USD. The team that will work on the intial months will be 3 experienced programmers working on it including me. This game will be DRM-free for PC, Mac, Linux , Android and iOS mobile devices (Possibly OUYA too). Once this playable version has been released, we will use community feedback and metrics to mold the game to reach it's greatest potential, and we will continue to develop it with a target of having a final version of the game in a maximum of 2 years.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<h2><b>Why make a business simulator?:</b></h2>
<p>To
spread knowledge about how to create and lead a succesful business.
This game will try to educate and inform people in order to give them
the confidence to start-up their own real-world company, and trough
it affect their society in a positive way, while reaping the personal
benefits a succesful business might bring. It is meant to inspire and
be fun too!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/119335/files/20131007175158-other3.png?1381193518"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<h2><b>How will we do it?:</b></h2>
<p>I
have been doing research on how to start a business for a couple of
years and I also have experience trying to setup my businesses as a
graphic designer, illustrator, coach, and also as a indie game
developer. Altought my research and experience has helped a lot into
the fundamental design of this game, this is not enough to make this
game a great and really useful informative medium, this is why I need
to hire business consultants. 
</p>
<p>We
need the money to get the help of business consultants in order to
make the game as informative and educational as possible about how
the real world of businesses works. If we get help from business
experts we will be able to make a game that will serve as an
introduction for any person who wants to understand how to create and
maintain a succesful business. Getting professional business input at
the start of this proyect is very important. We need their help from
the very beginning of the project in order to set the foundations of
the game and give it the right direction, if we hire them later we
may have to modify big portions of the game that do not contribute to
it's educational purposes, and that would cost us time and money,
meaning you won't be able to play it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We
also need the money to pay our programmers in order to create a
playable proof of concept, a pre alpha version in 5 months, with only
the most important parts of the game, and be able to realease it as
soon as possible before 5 months, so we can  develop it with the
input and feedback from it's players. That way we can change and
mould the game according to the feedback of our community of players.
This model is called Alphafunding, and is a model that was succesfuly
applied by many other games including Minecraft and Prison Architect.</p>
<p>We
will also need to invest in a web page that will serve as our own
crowdfunding site, and from where we will be able to keep accepting
pledges, colaborations, and donations, in exchange for rewards,
including the playable pre alpha version of the game. This is a very
important part of this proyect, since this ongoing crowdfunding model
will allow us to keep developing the game beyond the initial 5
months. This model was done succesfully by games like Star Citizen
and Prison Architect too.</p>
<p>We
also need to hire a better artist and graphic designer, a musician
and sound designer.</p>
<p>We
also need the money to set up a legal entity in order to receive the
funds.</p>
<p></p>

<h2><b>Who will do this?:</b></h2>
<p>I
am Christian Ibarra, you may know me from flash games such as “Zombie
Home Run” (<a href=""http://bit.ly/18Z9GOt"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://bit.ly/18Z9GOt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here to play Zombie Home Run</a>) and “TwitchPack” (<a href=""http://bit.ly/19LFUhd"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://bit.ly/19LFUhd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here to play Twitchpack</a>), and also an old
downloadable game called “Happier than you”. I'm a programmer,
graphic designer, illustrator (<a href=""http://christian223.deviantart.com/gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://christian223.deviantart.com/gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Click here to access Christian Ibarra's Art Gallery</a>), game designer and coach. </p>
<p>I have almost
20 years of experience developing games as a hobby, programming,
designing and making the art for them myself. Now my dream is to form
a group of talented developers to be able to create video games that
are not only fun and innovative, but also have a positive impact on
society.</p>
<p><b>The
team I want to put together are:</b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Pablo
Fuente Salas</b>, a very experienced programmer with more than 21 years
of profesional experience, he worked for many companies including
video game companies.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Kevin
Seligman</b>, has worked on various game projects, for various companies,
his roles included beign a lead programer.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Karla Circe Consolacion</b>, a great artist that can add personality and charm to the game. (</span><a href=""http://aircrackle.carbonmade.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"" target=""_blank"">Click here to access her Art Portfolio</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">) </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>A great Musician </b>soon to be announced!.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We will also get the help of various <b>business consultants</b>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Sarah Burrough</b>, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Pre-campaign advisor - I’ve also stolen the services of Nelly Cootalot’s
Campaign Manager Sarah. Continuing her world domination strategies
she has helped sort the tiers and has been on-hand with the set-up on
this crowd funder.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>

<br/><p></p>
<h2><b>When will we do this?:</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Once
the
              target amount is raised we will complete
              a playable alpha
              version in about 5 months. Then using our own web-site we
              can
              maintain an ongoing crowdfunding campaign while we use the
              pre-alpha
              version of this game to get input from the community of
              players, until we
              develop the final version of the game. We plan to reach
              the final
              version of the game in a maximum of 2 years.
      </p>
<p>So,
                when people help us reach our target goal of 20,000usd  they are actually helping us to
                      complete a playable demo to start an ongoing crowdfunding campaign
                          through our own web site like many other
      projects did, like Star citizen, The Pit, Prison Architect, and others. And of course they will also
                          get all future updates of the
                            game until reaching the final
                              version,
              plus all the rewards they have bought.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>Stretch
Goals:</b></h2>
<p>All stretch goals includes better and more music and art made by our hired artists, plus more hours with our business experts to secure a great educative game.<br/></p>
<p>20,000usd

<p>Q: Will backers get their rewards if we don't reach our goal?.</p>
<p>A: Yes!, they will get their rewards. Have in mind that for some rewards, we will only be able to complete them after we get far enough into development, so if we don't get enough money, we might take longer than expected to develop and deliver that reward. For example, you won't be able to see your name in the game until we reach that phase in the development where we are creating characters, and that will take us a couple of months, and each month costs us money.</p>

What is ""Venture Tales"":
It's a business simulator & strategy video game (for Windows, Mac + Linux) about setting up your own start-up; this game aims to entertain and inform players about the real world of business in a fun way.

A
business simulator is a unique subject that is not seen often in
video games. Plus it's also unique in that it will inform about how 
the real world of business works, therefore it will be a great
oportunity to learn about the subject to actual beginning
entrepeneurs and curious people, while they are having fun playing
it.
Also
since knowledge is power, it will be a great way to give more power
to people so that they can have more freedom to add value to society
in a positive way.







Why crowdfunding?:

I need to raise money to get together a team of programmers to work full time to complete a playable alpha version in about 5 months, for that I need to raise 20,000USD. The team that will work on the intial months will be 3 experienced programmers working on it including me. This game will be DRM-free for PC, Mac, Linux , Android and iOS mobile devices (Possibly OUYA too). Once this playable version has been released, we will use community feedback and metrics to mold the game to reach it's greatest potential, and we will continue to develop it with a target of having a final version of the game in a maximum of 2 years.

Details on the game:

Here
is more info on the subjects the game will tackle, each part would be
a detailed mechanic which will have an effect on the overall
simulation of the in-game-world.


You'll
	be playing a game of life, where you have your own in-game
	character, living with his family, you need to manage your time, and
	organize your life, your stress levels, your education, and your
	effectiveness in your business with the help of your in-game
	schedule and calendar.


You'll
	be able to take care of your relationships with your family,
	friends, co-workers, society, etc. If you spend too much time at
	work, you won't have time for family life.


You
	can choose how to live your private life, where and how to spend
	your money.


You
	can contact people, consultants, services, distributors, marketing,
	partners, negotiate and makes deals with them to work together.


Manage
	and make contracts with services, other people, employees, etc.


Keep
	track and work on legal and law matters.


Evaluate
	and choose employees, and assign them to whatever job you choose in
	your company. Create the company hierarchy.





Organize,
	control, and manage employees. 


Create
	and manage all the inner workings of your business from the inside
	out using an innovative visual representation that shows all the
	processes and activities in your business at the same time. 
	


You
	will be able to analize maps that shows different data of the
	context of where you live and relating to how your businesses
	influence society.


Control
	of spending, finances, earnings, flow of money, etc.


Manage
	different variables of your business, money, times of processes,
	quality of production or service, client satisfaction, etc.


Study
	of the market to obtain and maintain clients and other purposes. 


Get
	financing, create business plans, get help from incubators,
	accelerators, investors, get loans from banks or other mediums,
	etc. 


Research
	and development of business ideas and products. 


Buy
	and sell of real state using a world and city map. 


Manage
	transport times. 


React
	to events and news that affect the world and
	your business.





Why make a business simulator?:
To
spread knowledge about how to create and lead a succesful business.
This game will try to educate and inform people in order to give them
the confidence to start-up their own real-world company, and trough
it affect their society in a positive way, while reaping the personal
benefits a succesful business might bring. It is meant to inspire and
be fun too!



How will we do it?:
I
have been doing research on how to start a business for a couple of
years and I also have experience trying to setup my businesses as a
graphic designer, illustrator, coach, and also as a indie game
developer. Altought my research and experience has helped a lot into
the fundamental design of this game, this is not enough to make this
game a great and really useful informative medium, this is why I need
to hire business consultants. 

We
need the money to get the help of business consultants in order to
make the game as informative and educational as possible about how
the real world of businesses works. If we get help from business
experts we will be able to make a game that will serve as an
introduction for any person who wants to understand how to create and
maintain a succesful business. Getting professional business input at
the start of this proyect is very important. We need their help from
the very beginning of the project in order to set the foundations of
the game and give it the right direction, if we hire them later we
may have to modify big portions of the game that do not contribute to
it's educational purposes, and that would cost us time and money,
meaning you won't be able to play it as soon as possible.
We
also need the money to pay our programmers in order to create a
playable proof of concept, a pre alpha version in 5 months, with only
the most important parts of the game, and be able to realease it as
soon as possible before 5 months, so we can  develop it with the
input and feedback from it's players. That way we can change and
mould the game according to the feedback of our community of players.
This model is called Alphafunding, and is a model that was succesfuly
applied by many other games including Minecraft and Prison Architect.
We
will also need to invest in a web page that will serve as our own
crowdfunding site, and from where we will be able to keep accepting
pledges, colaborations, and donations, in exchange for rewards,
including the playable pre alpha version of the game. This is a very
important part of this proyect, since this ongoing crowdfunding model
will allow us to keep developing the game beyond the initial 5
months. This model was done succesfully by games like Star Citizen
and Prison Architect too.
We
also need to hire a better artist and graphic designer, a musician
and sound designer.
We
also need the money to set up a legal entity in order to receive the
funds.



Who will do this?:
I
am Christian Ibarra, you may know me from flash games such as “Zombie
Home Run” (Click here to play Zombie Home Run) and “TwitchPack” (Click here to play Twitchpack), and also an old
downloadable game called “Happier than you”. I'm a programmer,
graphic designer, illustrator (Click here to access Christian Ibarra's Art Gallery), game designer and coach. 
I have almost
20 years of experience developing games as a hobby, programming,
designing and making the art for them myself. Now my dream is to form
a group of talented developers to be able to create video games that
are not only fun and innovative, but also have a positive impact on
society.
The
team I want to put together are:
Pablo
Fuente Salas, a very experienced programmer with more than 21 years
of profesional experience, he worked for many companies including
video game companies.
Kevin
Seligman, has worked on various game projects, for various companies,
his roles included beign a lead programer.
Karla Circe Consolacion, a great artist that can add personality and charm to the game. (Click here to access her Art Portfolio) 
A great Musician soon to be announced!.
We will also get the help of various business consultants.
Sarah Burrough, Pre-campaign advisor - I’ve also stolen the services of Nelly Cootalot’s
Campaign Manager Sarah. Continuing her world domination strategies
she has helped sort the tiers and has been on-hand with the set-up on
this crowd funder.

Art from our artist:



When will we do this?:

Once
the
              target amount is raised we will complete
              a playable alpha
              version in about 5 months. Then using our own web-site we
              can
              maintain an ongoing crowdfunding campaign while we use the
              pre-alpha
              version of this game to get input from the community of
              players, until we
              develop the final version of the game. We plan to reach
              the final
              version of the game in a maximum of 2 years.
      
So,
                when people help us reach our target goal of 20,000usd  they are actually helping us to
                      complete a playable demo to start an ongoing crowdfunding campaign
                          through our own web site like many other
      projects did, like Star citizen, The Pit, Prison Architect, and others. And of course they will also
                          get all future updates of the
                            game until reaching the final
                              version,
              plus all the rewards they have bought.




Stretch
Goals:
All stretch goals includes better and more music and art made by our hired artists, plus more hours with our business experts to secure a great educative game.

Risks:
If our initial crowdfunding campaign does not generate enough revenue in order to continue development after our first financing money runs out, we will do a second crowdfunding campaign in order to be able to complete its development.
If we don't achieve our crowd-funding goals, I will seek for other funding options in government, business organizations, educational organizations, and others. If that doesn't work, I will raise money by my own after a few of years of work in other areas.
But this last resort option will delay the development of the game several years.

<p>The SwitchCharge was born out of our love for the Nintendo Switch™. We play it everywhere, at home, at work, on the train and heck even in the bath! It’s an incredible console with equally great games.</p>
<p>Yet there’s a constant worry when using a Switch on the go and trying to play the games we love. If you’re taking a long flight, have a sizeable commute or simply want to explore Breath of the Wild for more than a couple hours at a time, then battery life is a worry. There’s also no getting around it, the kickstand for the Switch sucks and we’re not only ones to have these problems…</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516290311/pbz4kqtoecezan1wxaeg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Trusted Reviews</strong>: ""<i>you can’t play in ‘tabletop’ mode with the kickstand and charge at the same time. Bizarre.""</i></p>
<p><strong>TechRadar:</strong> ""<i>The Switch draws so much power that at best they (portable phone battery packs) prevented the battery from dropping during play, rather than actively recharging it.""</i></p>
<p><strong>Engadget:</strong> ""<i>As you'd expect, battery life is the Switch's biggest portable problem""</i></p>
<p><strong>CNET:</strong> ""<i>Thing is, the Switch's kickstand isn't great. It's easy to tip. I've only been playing around with a Switch for a couple of days, and I've easily knocked it over a dozen times already.""</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Therefore using our experience with bringing technology products to market we decided to create our own case. This case was designed with feedback from hundreds of Nintendo fans and we believe it is the best accessory available for the Nintendo Switch™.</p>

<p><strong>Battery</strong></p>
<p>The 10,000mAh battery gives you up to 12 hours of additional battery life (when playing more intensive games) so you can play on the go without the need for bringing extra wires and a large, bulky battery pack (many of which don’t even work!). </p>
<p>With our technology, the SwitchCharge’s battery has been specifically designed to push out a high output allowing you to play and charge the Switch at the same time. </p>

<p><strong>Play and Charge</strong></p>
<p>The SwitchCharge is the first battery accessory designed specifically for the Nintendo Switch™. It allows you to charge and play on the go with no wires or bulky battery packs required. Many other battery packs on the market are not designed for the power hungry Switch and so can't charge fast enough whilst you're playing.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile Phone Charging!</strong></p>
<p>With the included USB-A port you can charge any device whilst also charging your Nintendo Switch. Now no need to carry around an extra battery power bank for your mobile phone.</p>

<p><strong>Improved Kickstand</strong></p>
<p>The SwitchCharge has an improved kickstand which offers greater stability and can be deployed at multiple angles to change the way you play. In fact, because we’ve moved the charging port to the right-hand side of the case, the SwitchCharge is one of the only ways to charge while playing in tabletop mode.</p>

<p><strong>Quick Lock/Unlock</strong></p>
<p><br/>With its two-part design, you can quickly lock and unlock the Switch into the case by simply pulling the top section up and sliding the switch out of its dock. To re-attach place the Switch into the USB C bottom dock, then click the top section down to firmly lock in place.</p>

<p><strong>LED Battery Indicator</strong></p>
<p>A LED battery indicator on the side of the SwitchCharge lets you easily know how much charge you have remaining. When it flashes RED you know it's nearly run out.</p>

<p><strong>Slim Design</strong></p>
<p>The SwitchCharge is built with durable ABS plastic, which is able to withstand most drops and scratches. We have kept a thin form factor and allowed easy access to all the required ports.</p>
<p>It's perfect to take with you on the go and easily fits in most pockets.</p>

<p><strong>Heat regulation</strong></p>
<p>The SwitchCharge has also been built to combat the problems of overheating and potential warping of the device. We have included a small gap between the Switch and the SwitchCharge to allow for airflow to cool down both devices. The dock system makes sure the Switch remains in place securely.</p>

<p>InDemand Design, the inventors of SwitchCharge, is a new design/engineering agency bringing together designers and engineers from multiple technology backgrounds. The team, currently 7 strong, share one main thing in common: their love of the Nintendo Switch. With your support, we can speed up our manufacturing schedule and bring the accessory that everyone needs to market. The agency has been built to be agile and adapt to trends quickly, from our experience we have found traditional agencies to be too slow to market.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have already developed prototypes and we're now looking to enter mass production. However, we need support from the Indiegogo community to make the SwitchCharge a reality. Once we reach our goal of $80,000, we'll be able to ship to our backers in under 3 months time. The initial investment will go both into tooling and the components required. </span></p>

We play it everywhere, at home, at work, on the train and heck even in the bath! It’s an incredible console with equally great games.
Yet there’s a constant worry when using a Switch on the go and trying to play the games we love. If you’re taking a long flight, have a sizeable commute or simply want to explore Breath of the Wild for more than a couple hours at a time, then battery life is a worry. There’s also no getting around it, the kickstand for the Switch sucks and we’re not only ones to have these problems…

Trusted Reviews: ""you can’t play in ‘tabletop’ mode with the kickstand and charge at the same time. Bizarre.""
TechRadar: ""The Switch draws so much power that at best they (portable phone battery packs) prevented the battery from dropping during play, rather than actively recharging it.""
Engadget: ""As you'd expect, battery life is the Switch's biggest portable problem""
CNET: ""Thing is, the Switch's kickstand isn't great. It's easy to tip. I've only been playing around with a Switch for a couple of days, and I've easily knocked it over a dozen times already.""
 
Therefore using our experience with bringing technology products to market we decided to create our own case. This case was designed with feedback from hundreds of Nintendo fans and we believe it is the best accessory available for the Nintendo Switch™.
Introducing the SwitchCharge:
 

The SwitchCharge is the world’s first multifunctional battery case designed for the Nintendo Switch™. It incorporates a high capacity 10,000mAh battery, mobile phone charging, an improved kickstand, 2 game card slots and also added protection for your Switch.
All of this is packed into a case which is not only thin and light but also, allows you to take the Nintendo Switch™ anywhere without the worry of running out of battery.

 

SwitchCharge aims to rid the need to bring with you multiple accessories. Instead SwitchCharge is designed to be ultra portable, thin and lightweight. The added battery life not only gives you the ability to play wherever you are on the go but also add's protection to your Nintendo Switch™.


 

Battery
The 10,000mAh battery gives you up to 12 hours of additional battery life (when playing more intensive games) so you can play on the go without the need for bringing extra wires and a large, bulky battery pack (many of which don’t even work!). 
With our technology, the SwitchCharge’s battery has been specifically designed to push out a high output allowing you to play and charge the Switch at the same time. 
Battery Life Tests:

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: 10hrs 40mins 

Mario Kart 8: 10 hrs 45 mins

1-2-Switch: 12hrs 55mins

Fast RMX: 13hrs 20mins 

Snipperclips: 13hrs 30mins

Shovel Knight: 14hrs 15mins  


 

  
 
Play and Charge
The SwitchCharge is the first battery accessory designed specifically for the Nintendo Switch™. It allows you to charge and play on the go with no wires or bulky battery packs required. Many other battery packs on the market are not designed for the power hungry Switch and so can't charge fast enough whilst you're playing.

Mobile Phone Charging!
With the included USB-A port you can charge any device whilst also charging your Nintendo Switch. Now no need to carry around an extra battery power bank for your mobile phone.


Improved Kickstand
The SwitchCharge has an improved kickstand which offers greater stability and can be deployed at multiple angles to change the way you play. In fact, because we’ve moved the charging port to the right-hand side of the case, the SwitchCharge is one of the only ways to charge while playing in tabletop mode.
 

 
 
2 Game Card Slots
No need for extra carrying cases, the SwitchCharge not only protects the Nintendo Switch™ but also has slots for 2 extra game cards to bring along with you on the go.
 

 ​
 
Quick Lock/Unlock
With its two-part design, you can quickly lock and unlock the Switch into the case by simply pulling the top section up and sliding the switch out of its dock. To re-attach place the Switch into the USB C bottom dock, then click the top section down to firmly lock in place.

 
LED Battery Indicator
A LED battery indicator on the side of the SwitchCharge lets you easily know how much charge you have remaining. When it flashes RED you know it's nearly run out.

 
Slim Design
The SwitchCharge is built with durable ABS plastic, which is able to withstand most drops and scratches. We have kept a thin form factor and allowed easy access to all the required ports.
It's perfect to take with you on the go and easily fits in most pockets.

 
Heat regulation
The SwitchCharge has also been built to combat the problems of overheating and potential warping of the device. We have included a small gap between the Switch and the SwitchCharge to allow for airflow to cool down both devices. The dock system makes sure the Switch remains in place securely.

 
The SwitchCharge is perfect to play in the following ways:
 
1. On the go in handheld mode

 
2. Charge while playing on table top mode

 

Width: 158mm
Height: 118mm
Depth: 26mm
Weight: 390g
Game Card Slots: 2
Internal Battery Type: Lithium-ion battery
Battery capacity: 10,000mAh
Power output: 5V/2.4A
Ports: USB-C + USB-A
Battery Life: Up to 12 hours additional battery in real world usage.
Charging Time: Approx 3 hours.
 

 

 

To lock the Switch in place take the following steps:

Unclick and slide the top section upwards 2/3cm. It will remain attached to the case
Slide the Switch into the case making sure it locks into the USB C plug in the base
Slide the top section downwards until you hear a click


Easy access to all ports on the top of the Switch due to the large cut-outs.

The secure the game cards into place simply slide the game card into a free slot until it reaches the bottom. To remove use your finger to push the exposed back of the card upwards to free the game card.

InDemand Design, the inventors of SwitchCharge, is a new design/engineering agency bringing together designers and engineers from multiple technology backgrounds. The team, currently 7 strong, share one main thing in common: their love of the Nintendo Switch. With your support, we can speed up our manufacturing schedule and bring the accessory that everyone needs to market. The agency has been built to be agile and adapt to trends quickly, from our experience we have found traditional agencies to be too slow to market.
We have already developed prototypes and we're now looking to enter mass production. However, we need support from the Indiegogo community to make the SwitchCharge a reality. Once we reach our goal of $80,000, we'll be able to ship to our backers in under 3 months time. The initial investment will go both into tooling and the components required. 


We are currently in the middle of our product development stage. We are creating the very best product based upon all the feedback we have received. We are on track and are making good progress. 

 




As with all crowdfunded projects, bringing SwitchCharge to life will be a thorough and complex task as we turn our prototypes into production. There are factors such as sourcing parts and shipping logistics that can cause possible delays. 
We’re committed to making SwitchCharge a success and will ensure we keep you up-to-date throughout this journey. Thank you for your support!

My name is Charles Bodner (<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pub/charles-bodner/56/336/b60"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LinkedIn</a>) and I am the founder of NXTLVL Gaming Center. I am a graduate of Temple University's Fox School of Business where I double majored in Management Information Systems and Marketing. </p>
<p>I came up with the idea for NXTLVL after noticing <b>3 distinct needs</b> in our society:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>The <b>need for college scholarships</b> to support students in reducing the cost for college and easing their debt burden.</li>
<li>The need for gamers of all backgrounds to come together and share their passion for gaming in a <b>safe, fun, and afforable environment</b>.</li>
<li>The need for <b>free technology oriented classes</b> to supplement socioeconomic factors that may make it difficult for some to learn needed skills in today's technology driven market.</li>
</ol>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>What is NXTLVL Gaming Center?</b></span></p>
<p>NXTLVL Gaming Center is a <b>non-profit</b> cyber cafe where 100% of the proceeds go towards creating college scholarships for technology related studies. We strive to give gamers a safe place to come play their favorite games all while helping others get to the NXTLVL of their education!</p>
<b>So how will NXTLVL accomplish this?</b></span><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Gaming for a cause: When you play, you give! </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Unlike traditional non-profits, NXTLVL has a business model to support it's efforts. We earn revenue by running a gaming center (or cyber cafe if you will) where visitors will pay a small hourly rate to play. Other revenue streams include optional memberships (with perks), food sales, game trade-ins, direct donations, and grants. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The goal is to have a variety of game consoles, PCs, and games to encourage gamers from all walks of life and interests to share their passion together while supporting their local community. We will also host regular events and tournaments based off the needs/wants of our customers where they will compete for great prizes, either purchased by us or donated from gaming developers and manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We will also host free to the public technology and computer related classes to help those who may not have the resources to learn them otherwise. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>The facts and the impact!</b></span></p>
<p>Let's look at some of the facts about today's college education.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> the average salary for someone who doesn't graduate from college makes almost half of what a person with an associates degree will make.</li>
<li>On average, a 2 year degree will earn an individual close to the national average of $41,000 a year.</li>
<li>A four year college graduate earns on average $55,000 a year and a master's degree earns $65,000+ a year on average.</li>
<li> Average student debt is $29,000 with the total student debt outstanding at over $1 Trillion! </li>
<li>35% of all student loans are in delinquency because of their inability to pay for numerous reasons including: poor job market, majors that aren't in demand, and stagnant salaries. (just to name a few)</li>
<li>The most wanted/valuable majors today are in the technology and science field: #1 Biomedical Engineering (median pay $97k), #3 Computer Science (median pay $97k), #4 Software Engineering (median pay $87k), #8 Management Information Systems (median pay $88k). (again just to name a few)</li>
</ul>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">After looking at some of these facts we see the need to help students to get into these technology oriented fields. NXTLVL wants to help to achieve this, but in a way that we find fun! <b>Gaming isn't a subculture anymore</b> like it was when most of us were young, it is mainstream and the demand for a unique gaming experience is there! Here's a little snippet from ""Video Games, The Movie"" explaining just how popular games are in today's culture.  </span>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>The Nitty Gritty!</b></span></p>
<p>Our goal here is to raise $80,000 which should be an easy task considering how many dedicated gamers we have out there! Now this sounds like alot of money (and it is) but once the startup costs are taken care of, we are left with minimal operational costs. Here is the breakdown of the startup cost:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>30 Samsung LEDTV's @ $500 each</li>
<li>30 Lounge Chairs @$250 each</li>
<li>15 XBox 360 @$200 each</li>
<li>15 Playstation 3 @$200 each</li>
<li>10 Refurb Nintendo Wii @$80 each</li>
<li>Bulk Game Library Budget @$5,000</li>
<li>1 Year 3,500 square foot Building Lease @$42,000</li>
<li>(Currently reaching out to PC manufacturers for 20 donated gaming PC's) not included in the $80k startup cost. </li>
</ul>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">In terms of projected revenue, we are looking at a conservative year 3 estimate of $175,000 from rental revenue <b>alone</b>. (this is with the assumption we will be operating at an average of 25% capacity year round)</span><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><br/></b></span></p>

</div></div>","A little story... Hello everyone! My name is Charles Bodner (LinkedIn) and I am the founder of NXTLVL Gaming Center. I am a graduate of Temple University's Fox School of Business where I double majored in Management Information Systems and Marketing. 
I came up with the idea for NXTLVL after noticing 3 distinct needs in our society:


The need for college scholarships to support students in reducing the cost for college and easing their debt burden.
The need for gamers of all backgrounds to come together and share their passion for gaming in a safe, fun, and afforable environment.
The need for free technology oriented classes to supplement socioeconomic factors that may make it difficult for some to learn needed skills in today's technology driven market.

What is NXTLVL Gaming Center?
NXTLVL Gaming Center is a non-profit cyber cafe where 100% of the proceeds go towards creating college scholarships for technology related studies. We strive to give gamers a safe place to come play their favorite games all while helping others get to the NXTLVL of their education!
So how will NXTLVL accomplish this?Gaming for a cause: When you play, you give! 
Unlike traditional non-profits, NXTLVL has a business model to support it's efforts. We earn revenue by running a gaming center (or cyber cafe if you will) where visitors will pay a small hourly rate to play. Other revenue streams include optional memberships (with perks), food sales, game trade-ins, direct donations, and grants. 
The goal is to have a variety of game consoles, PCs, and games to encourage gamers from all walks of life and interests to share their passion together while supporting their local community. We will also host regular events and tournaments based off the needs/wants of our customers where they will compete for great prizes, either purchased by us or donated from gaming developers and manufacturers.
We will also host free to the public technology and computer related classes to help those who may not have the resources to learn them otherwise. 
The facts and the impact!
Let's look at some of the facts about today's college education.


According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the average salary for someone who doesn't graduate from college makes almost half of what a person with an associates degree will make.
On average, a 2 year degree will earn an individual close to the national average of $41,000 a year.
A four year college graduate earns on average $55,000 a year and a master's degree earns $65,000+ a year on average.
 Average student debt is $29,000 with the total student debt outstanding at over $1 Trillion! 
35% of all student loans are in delinquency because of their inability to pay for numerous reasons including: poor job market, majors that aren't in demand, and stagnant salaries. (just to name a few)
The most wanted/valuable majors today are in the technology and science field: #1 Biomedical Engineering (median pay $97k), #3 Computer Science (median pay $97k), #4 Software Engineering (median pay $87k), #8 Management Information Systems (median pay $88k). (again just to name a few)

After looking at some of these facts we see the need to help students to get into these technology oriented fields. NXTLVL wants to help to achieve this, but in a way that we find fun! Gaming isn't a subculture anymore like it was when most of us were young, it is mainstream and the demand for a unique gaming experience is there! Here's a little snippet from ""Video Games, The Movie"" explaining just how popular games are in today's culture.  


The Nitty Gritty!
Our goal here is to raise $80,000 which should be an easy task considering how many dedicated gamers we have out there! Now this sounds like alot of money (and it is) but once the startup costs are taken care of, we are left with minimal operational costs. Here is the breakdown of the startup cost:


30 Samsung LEDTV's @ $500 each
30 Lounge Chairs @$250 each
15 XBox 360 @$200 each
15 Playstation 3 @$200 each
10 Refurb Nintendo Wii @$80 each
Bulk Game Library Budget @$5,000
1 Year 3,500 square foot Building Lease @$42,000
(Currently reaching out to PC manufacturers for 20 donated gaming PC's) not included in the $80k startup cost. 

In terms of projected revenue, we are looking at a conservative year 3 estimate of $175,000 from rental revenue alone. (this is with the assumption we will be operating at an average of 25% capacity year round)
We can only do this with your support!

<p><strong>Welcome to the Indiegogo funding page for Stone Rage.</strong> We have reached a point where the alpha phase of Stone Rage is in sight. It has been a long road and it is thanks to the support and ideas from fans like you that we have continued to push forward and make our dream for Stone Rage a reality. We will begin alpha play-testing and bug fixing very soon which will be a huge milestone for the project. Now, while we are getting closer to the alpha phase we need one more push to get us even further. There is still plenty left to accomplish and with the money we make here we will be able to step up our production and get our game into the player’s hands sooner. We truly appreciate your support and thank you all endlessly for your contributions that we receive here. Together we can bring Stone Rage to the foreground of the gaming world and make it the exciting, bone crushing, multiplayer experience it was always meant to be.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Information on the game:</strong> <br/>• Game Title: </strong>Stone Rage<strong> <br/>• Platform: </strong>PC<strong> <br/>• Genre: </strong>Action and adventure<strong> <br/>• Theme: </strong>Rural Survival<strong> <br/>• Camera View: </strong>Third Person<strong> <br/>• Engine: </strong>Unreal Engine 4<strong><br/>• Price: </strong>Free-To-Play<strong><br/>• Public Beta Release Date: </strong>TBD <strong><br/>• Company: </strong>LLC (GmbH) Registered<strong> <br/>• Project Started: </strong>January 2011</p>
<p><strong>Stone Rage™ </strong>is a Free-To-Play online third person multiplayer action game set within the Pleistocene and Eocene eras, featuring prehistoric tribalism, prehistoric landscapes and prehistoric animals. Players will take control of a single character of either a human class, neanderthal tribe or animal genus and wreak havoc in either survival, team objective or deathmatch game types. As players win games and progress through achievements, options in weapon layout, upgrades and personalized character customization will be unlock, giving a large array of choices to those who do not wish to completely conform to a single archetype.</p>
<p>Every character has a set of unique traits and abilities, as well as unlockables to modify their effects and tactical usage, ensuring that no two games will play the same, and no one player is by default more or less dangerous than another. Situation and opportunity play as much a part in winning a game as how well players use their character skills and environment to their advantage. Since tribal skirmishes and hunts take place across a wide stretch of land, players will encounter sprawling forests with prowling smilodon, vast plains with marching mammoth herds and gastornis scavenging the remains left behind by the prey of dire wolves!</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Animal classes: </strong>One of the most boasted qualities about Stone Rage is its animal classes. Stone Rage offers a wide array of animals with different tactics, and abilities that will keep players gaming for days. We have put strenuous effort into picking out the best classes possible to keep players entertained. Our classes include the <strong>Entelodont</strong> for stealth, the <strong>Woolly Rhinocerous</strong> for defense, the <strong>Gastornis</strong> as a scout class, a <strong>Cave Bear</strong> for warrior class, <strong>Saber Tooth Tiger</strong> for the hunter class, and finally the <strong>Mammoth</strong> as the heavy. We also provide support animals for each animal class, which are playable as well.</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Human/Neanderthal classes: </strong>Stone Rage contains two different groups: the Humans and the Neanderthals. Each group has its own set of six different playable classes. There’s the <strong>warrior</strong>, the <strong>guard</strong>, the <strong>archer</strong>, the <strong>hunter</strong>, the <strong>shaman</strong>, and the <strong>ubermensch</strong>. Each class performs an important role on the battlefield and will be vital in ensuring victory for either the Humans or the Neanderthals.</p>

<p>We're confident in our product, and we know that if you play it, there's a good chance you'll enjoy it enough to tell your friends. Inviting them to play though Facebook will earn you chips, and will help us bring more people into the game. More people means a whole lot more fun!</p>

They were gigantic, interstellar, intelligent and hostile to all other life. It soon became clear that humankind stood no chance against the Colossals. The colonies fell one after another, and by the start of 2260s there was only the Earth left. There weren't many options left, and a desperate plan was chosen as a last attempt to turn the tide of the war.  All effort was focused on the creation of one portal, that led to a dwarf galaxy called Pegasus. The plan was to expand to this distant galaxy, in the hope of finding something to change the situation back home, be it a new technology or a new weapon. And if no such a miracle would be found, at least it would take the Colossals a hundred years more to reach the Pegasus galaxy, making it a temporary refuge.  Three main fleets were sent to the Pegasus galaxy: The Zeus Link fleet by the European Union, named after the portal itself, the 1st Expeditionary Fleet from the United States, and Al-Musta’mara fleet from the Daras Combine.There was no time for careful reconnaissance or preparations; the Colossals were only fifteen years away from the Earth. The first units entered the portal on Sunday 25th of August 2262, with fifteen years of time to find a way to save the Earth.  The Pegasus Expedition is a combination of an epic sci-fi story and a solid foundation of a space grand strategy game. We aspire to provide you with an unique strategy game experience, bringing together the best from both worlds. Our beautiful, ethereal soundtrack will accompany you on your journey as your mission transitions from exploration to governance, conquest, and eventually a fight for survival.Building on the legacy of the grand strategy genre, The Pegasus Expedition adds a strong narrative side to the classic 4X-gameplay which involves managing your diplomatic ties, armies, economy and scientific development.   The Pegasus Galaxy has been blooming with intelligent life for a long time. It has its own civilizations, with their own problems and conflicts. The fragile balance reached over time has now been irreversibly shaken by the forceful appearance of a new species - Humans.  GAMEPLAY  A Story Driven 4X-gameThe Pegasus Expedition is a story driven grand strategy game which focuses on combining an epic sci-fi narrative with a solid 4X foundation to create a very unique narrative strategy game experience. Your decisions and actions shape the galaxy around you, with every alliance and crisis you suffer or cause leaving their mark.  The CouncilAs the Director of Zeus Link fleet, you control all aspects of the Zeus Link, making all of your critical decisions with your council; the group of your closest subordinates and advisors. They will inform you of the new developments in the galaxy, and do their part in solving the numerous crises and incidents you will have to resolve, one way or another.  Economy You will start out with only your seasoned but thin expeditionary fleet, and you will need to develop a functioning economy and fast to keep the Expedition going. After all, you will be supplied from home for only so long.     Diplomacy in a Torn Galaxy The Pegasus Galaxy is full of independent factions, with their own grudges, rivalries and fragile alliances, so you’ll need to navigate this diplomatic landscape with care in order to succeed. That will involve both making dynamic deals and treaties in the diplomacy system, as well as making tough choices in dialogue. After all, you are a suspicious and despised newcomer in this galaxy, with limited time and huge expectations to accomplish.   Manage your Fleets and OfficersTo survive in this new and often hostile galaxy, it’s extremely important to keep your forces improving and your leaders trained. You will have to work with limited human resources, and choosing the right person for the right job can often make the difference. Assign admirals, governors and special forces operatives to help you to victory.  Stellar WarfareWar never really changes, and the Pegasus galaxy has a lot of it to offer. Choose your strategies and plan your battles well, as in the Pegasus Expedition’s unique combat, careful planning is everything. Espionage and the well thought out movement of your forces will be crucial in war, in order to have your fleets at the right place at the right time.  TechnologyIn the future, there’s an even shinier future ahead. There are great discoveries to be made, and many things, great and less great, that you can do using those discoveries. To have a chance against your foes, you'll need to be one step ahead of them in technology too, and not just in strategy.  Fight Against the Ever Worsening OddsYour starting situation is not an easy one... And it’s only going to get worse. The longer the expedition continues, the higher the stakes, with new threats, enemies, backstabbers and heroic resistance movements.

<p>Hello! My name is Matt Goles and I'm an indie game developer with over 10 years of experience in the industry.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Hello, I am Victor Maillé, also known as Nimbus, and I am the team captain of dnj.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are a team that is competing in the new fps by Nadeo/Ubisoft called Shootmania. It's a fast paced shooter that's a mix between quake and counter-strike.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are gamers that train everyday to make it in the e-sports scene and sadly we didn't qualify in the last tournament to get a trip to IPL5. From friends of the community or the 100 000$ prize pool, we really want to do the trip to vegas.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>IPL 5(from november 29th till december the 3rd)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Some notable achievements from myself in this game(some with the same roster):</div>
<div>
<br/><em><strong>Semi-finals IPL PAX qualifiers</strong></em><br/>[media]<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFDvt7noLB4&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=UUN27SmaYg2RUtnjDoOsS8hQ%5B/media%5D"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFDvt7noLB4&amp;...</a> (skip to 6:20 for me)<br/><em><strong>Semi-finals NASC OPEN #1</strong></em><br/>[media]<a href=""http://www.twitch.tv/nasclive/b/333128515%5B/media%5D"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">http://www.twitch.tv/nasclive/b/333128515[/media]</a><br/><a class=""bbc_url"" href=""http://challonge.com/nasc_open_1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""External link"">http://challonge.com/nasc_open_1</a><br/><em><strong>finals NASC OPEN #2</strong></em> <a class=""bbc_url"" href=""http://challonge.com/nasc_open_2"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""External link"">http://challonge.com/nasc_open_2</a><br/><strong><em>IPL QUAL #3 round of 16</em></strong>(now complexity)<br/>[media]<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9prSu7C5-xs&amp;list=UUN27SmaYg2RUtnjDoOsS8hQ&amp;index=19&amp;feature=plcp%5B/media%5D"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9prSu7C5-xs&amp;...</a><br/><strong><em>IPL QUAL #2 round of 32</em></strong>(had 2 new substitutes again for that tournament) <a class=""bbc_url"" href=""http://challonge.com/ipl5smna2"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""External link"">http://challonge.com/ipl5smna2</a><br/><strong><em>IPL QUAL #1 round of 32</em></strong>(had 2 substitutes for that tournament) <a class=""bbc_url"" href=""http://challonge.com/ipl5smna1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""External link"">http://challonge.com/ipl5smna1</a><br/><strong><em>IGL SHOOTMANIA CUP #3</em></strong> <a class=""bbc_url"" href=""http://thek1ng.free.fr/?page=equipes&amp;section=resultats&amp;id=342"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""External link"">http://thek1ng.free....esultats&amp;id=342</a>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
What we need is 500$.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now the whole trip is going to cost us about 1700$ but we can afford a big part of that. The 500$ is to help nimbus get from canada to Las Vegas(since his flight alone is 540$).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What do you get for donating? Well you get of course the eternal gratitude of us 3 for helping gamers reach their dreams. You can also select from the many perks where you can get from a simple thank you, nimbus doing crazy break dance moves while wearing a horse mask at IPL 5(video included) or some lessons.</div>
<strong>Why should we help you guys?</strong><br/><ul>
<li>    Organizer of a weekly shootmania tournament called NASC</li>
<li>    One of the most helpful/respecting team in the shootmania community. We pride ourselves in trying to play professionally while helping others and not leaving them with degrading comments.</li>
<li>    We have been there on different teams since very early in the beta(the start for me personally) and we have worked hard for an event that we finally didn't qualify for(since we were a newly assembled team and had a lack of experience with this roster)</li>
<li>    We are trying to grow the shootmania community and IPL 5 could help us get a better leverage to better help this game become a success.</li>
<li>    We are considered a very good team even if we are a newly made one. Top teams comes to us for scrims and we do well in them. We will prove our worth with a chance like this.</li>
<li>    You get some perks if you help us</li>
</ul>
<div class=""_mce_tagged_br"">
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Shootmania has a lot of potential to step into the future of e-sports. With major tournaments like IPL and ESWC already, while only in the beta, shows promise. Big teams like fnatic, millenium, epsilon, infused, sk gaming, just to name a few, are already competing in this game.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You will help us grow the North-American shootmania community by adding another team to the ones competing at the IPL. We are already really involved in the community(maker of the NASC weekly tournament, tutorials. many threads and more) and would have the leverage to continue in the future to influence this e-sport.</div>
<div>

Hello, I am Victor Maillé, also known as Nimbus, and I am the team captain of dnj.
 
We are a team that is competing in the new fps by Nadeo/Ubisoft called Shootmania. It's a fast paced shooter that's a mix between quake and counter-strike.
 
We are gamers that train everyday to make it in the e-sports scene and sadly we didn't qualify in the last tournament to get a trip to IPL5. From friends of the community or the 100 000$ prize pool, we really want to do the trip to vegas.
 
IPL 5(from november 29th till december the 3rd)
 
Some notable achievements from myself in this game(some with the same roster):

Semi-finals IPL PAX qualifiers[media]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFDvt7noLB4&... (skip to 6:20 for me)Semi-finals NASC OPEN #1[media]http://www.twitch.tv/nasclive/b/333128515[/media]http://challonge.com/nasc_open_1finals NASC OPEN #2 http://challonge.com/nasc_open_2IPL QUAL #3 round of 16(now complexity)[media]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9prSu7C5-xs&...IPL QUAL #2 round of 32(had 2 new substitutes again for that tournament) http://challonge.com/ipl5smna2IPL QUAL #1 round of 32(had 2 substitutes for that tournament) http://challonge.com/ipl5smna1IGL SHOOTMANIA CUP #3 http://thek1ng.free....esultats&id=342


What We Need & What You Get
What we need is 500$.
 
Now the whole trip is going to cost us about 1700$ but we can afford a big part of that. The 500$ is to help nimbus get from canada to Las Vegas(since his flight alone is 540$).
 
What do you get for donating? Well you get of course the eternal gratitude of us 3 for helping gamers reach their dreams. You can also select from the many perks where you can get from a simple thank you, nimbus doing crazy break dance moves while wearing a horse mask at IPL 5(video included) or some lessons.
Why should we help you guys?
    Organizer of a weekly shootmania tournament called NASC
    One of the most helpful/respecting team in the shootmania community. We pride ourselves in trying to play professionally while helping others and not leaving them with degrading comments.
    We have been there on different teams since very early in the beta(the start for me personally) and we have worked hard for an event that we finally didn't qualify for(since we were a newly assembled team and had a lack of experience with this roster)
    We are trying to grow the shootmania community and IPL 5 could help us get a better leverage to better help this game become a success.
    We are considered a very good team even if we are a newly made one. Top teams comes to us for scrims and we do well in them. We will prove our worth with a chance like this.
    You get some perks if you help us


The Impact
Shootmania has a lot of potential to step into the future of e-sports. With major tournaments like IPL and ESWC already, while only in the beta, shows promise. Big teams like fnatic, millenium, epsilon, infused, sk gaming, just to name a few, are already competing in this game.
 
You will help us grow the North-American shootmania community by adding another team to the ones competing at the IPL. We are already really involved in the community(maker of the NASC weekly tournament, tutorials. many threads and more) and would have the leverage to continue in the future to influence this e-sport.

Some prizes you can earn are like: electronics, candy, and much more!<br/><br/>
You start out with three boxes and you tap on the screen to stop the blocks moving. You want to stack them up in a vertical line all the way to the top as far as you can go. If you miss stacking the blocks one on top of the other, than you lose a block each time. If you keep going farther up, then it gets faster and harder.

<h3>What is Dire Gazebo?</h3>
<p><strong>There are plenty of tools that allow players and GMs to view a map or talk in real time, over the internet but far fewer tools to allow players and GMs to store and share their character sheets online. I intend to create a fantastic tool that can be used either on its own or in conjunction with other apps to create a fantastic experience both online and at the gaming table. </strong></p>
<p>I have been playing tabletop RPGs for several years and using interactive character sheet PDFs for a while but I have always felt that they did not contain all the information I need. For this reason I started working on a web based character sheet which I dubbed the dire gazebo character forge.</p>
<p>Since then I have expanded my plans to include a suite of GM's tools including initiative/combat tracking, random encounter &amp; treasure generation and NPC &amp; monster stats for easy inclusion in encounters.</p>
<p>This will also include the ability for DMs to silently view players' character sheets in order to add experience, roll save/skill checks and make any other changes as needed without needing to take the sheet off the player or keep an updated list of common rolls.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I aim to make all of this available for free to players and DMs with the potential for premium features and bonus content to be available for a small cost in order to cover server fees but to do this, I need your help!</p>
<h3>Dire gazebo is flexible!</h3>
<p>For many players and GMs, flexibility is the most important thing. It is this idea of flexibility and the aim to create a fantastic online tool, which is useful even for those of us that don't use maps, that this project is based on.</p>
<p>I aim for the system to include large amounts of OGL content inbuilt into the system but it will also be possible for users to create spells, items, effects and pretty much anything else through a simple interface that will allow stats, skills etc. to be affected as needed. </p>
<p>This will be the exact same system as I will be using to input the OGL content. I aim for it to make anything within the mechanics of the pathfinder system possible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I need to complete the site</h3>
<p>A large amount of the functionality is already complete but it just needs a push to get finished. I have chosen to use flexible funding because any amount of money will allow me to spend time working on the project but the more I get, the more time I can afford to spend on this. I believe $1000 should be enough for me to complete the project in a reasonable amount of time as I will be able to afford to dedicate myself to it fully.</p>
<p>More funding may allow extensions such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS/Android tablet apps? - These would aim to support offline use of character sheets among any other potential perks of the touchscreen environment.</li>
<li>Support for systems other than Pathfinder?</li>
<li>Integration with a separate 'virtual tabletop' to create a truly complete experience for those that want it?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If I fail to reach the full amount I will still work on the site, it may just take longer to complete and a first launch may be missing a few features.</p>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am a computer science undergraduate. I have been doing web development in various forms for over 5 years and android development for the past year. I have been playing various tabletop RPGs for most of my life, off and on and firmly believe that the inclusion of technology, whether that is laptops, tablets or something else at the gaming table is a powerful thing. </p>

<li>Spread the word to your gaming group, facebook friends, twitter follower and anyone else you can.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I am Joshua Jones and one of the main developers of the Ragnarok Rising TCG.  I have been playing TCGs/CCGs since about the time Beta came out for Magic: The Gathering and have been hooked since.  For years, friends and I have talked about adjusting various home rules and cards to M:tg, but I have always wanted to make my own.  When a friend of mine, DA Roberts, wrote an amazing zombie story, I felt like this was my chance to make something amazing and fresh.</p>
<p>I have spent the last several months working with another friend and DA, specing out new cards, rules, mechanics, etc for this game.  Right now, I am about to enter the Beta testing phases so we can tweak out the final rules.  This is where you good people come in.  Your money will help me get beta decks and final print decks up and going to be presented to an already interested publisher.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am asking for the minimum $500 because I know that will get me where I need to be to get these decks printed as well as the software I need to finalize the cards.</li>
<li>As far as my rewards for your hard earned money being donated to me, I will be offering finalized decks, printing by us and there for will be limited editions.  I will also offer the ability to help create a card based on you or an idea you have, copies of the books, and have the honor of being written in as a character in the next book!  How awesome is that!</li>
<li>If in the case I am not able to reach my goal, any funds will still go towards printing and rewards will still be given.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>Hello everyone, my name is Enkeli, I am an independent designer, I enjoy making mods for games especially Age Of Empires, but unfortunately my work consumes me to be able to do a job for the whole community that people have wanted for years and That's why I turn to this.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484603816/jhp1ctht4bxngomgg4yy.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My idea is based on the original game Age of Empires II HD on Steam, create a Total Conversion Mod, where each civilization is completely different from each other, that each civilization has its own different units and buildings. Already enough to see European soldiers with the Aztecs and Japanese, to see variety, that is beautifully aesthetic, but mainly that the gameplay is intact.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484603872/gimqdquwyiqcndp7sfx5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>  I use programs like Micro Poser to create the units, with everything I learned from civilizations forums and use 3ds max for buildings, I have all licensed and I plan to use my knowledge in the area of design to make many players dream come true Of Age of Empires</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484603930/uys99fawl7vnp5xb4rwj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> Currently in six months of work I have completed the civilizations of Spain, England, France and the Aztecs and soon I will have finished the Celts, but time consumes me and I do not want to leave this work forgotten.</p>
<p>That is why I ask for your support, both from the community of Age Of Empires who support me to create this for you. I will stop my work as an independent designer for a month and dedicate myself full time to do this work if we manage to reach the goal, but even if we surpass it I will also dedicate myself to making the civilizations of the new expansions, I ask for their support so that I can Leave aside some time for my work and do this for you, and enjoy it, make this dream come true that many have had for years and that I can make reality before the summer of this year.</p>

</div></div>","Hello everyone, my name is Enkeli, I am an independent designer, I enjoy making mods for games especially Age Of Empires, but unfortunately my work consumes me to be able to do a job for the whole community that people have wanted for years and That's why I turn to this.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
My idea is based on the original game Age of Empires II HD on Steam, create a Total Conversion Mod, where each civilization is completely different from each other, that each civilization has its own different units and buildings. Already enough to see European soldiers with the Aztecs and Japanese, to see variety, that is beautifully aesthetic, but mainly that the gameplay is intact.

  I use programs like Micro Poser to create the units, with everything I learned from civilizations forums and use 3ds max for buildings, I have all licensed and I plan to use my knowledge in the area of design to make many players dream come true Of Age of Empires

 Currently in six months of work I have completed the civilizations of Spain, England, France and the Aztecs and soon I will have finished the Celts, but time consumes me and I do not want to leave this work forgotten.
That is why I ask for your support, both from the community of Age Of Empires who support me to create this for you. I will stop my work as an independent designer for a month and dedicate myself full time to do this work if we manage to reach the goal, but even if we surpass it I will also dedicate myself to making the civilizations of the new expansions, I ask for their support so that I can Leave aside some time for my work and do this for you, and enjoy it, make this dream come true that many have had for years and that I can make reality before the summer of this year.

 My work is of a quality different from what you see in many forums and you can try it since a Beta version is already available on Steam but I will list a list of changes:
* New land * New Gaia created 100% by me 
* New, more beautiful and realistic textures 
* Remastering the original campaigns, making the same more difficult 
* New, more beautiful icons * Each unit will be different 
* Provisions for artillery 
* Fully compatible with multiplayer
* Fully compatible with all languages 
* And many more things that will revive that passion for this game.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why did we start this campaign?</b><br/>
</h3>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>This campaign helps us make our dream come true. While Stellar Stars isn't our first game, our dream is to create an awesome gameplay experience for you. Our passion is in crafting games and we want to express this through Stellar Stars. </p>
<p>Stellar Stars has a lot of emphasis on gameplay mechanics which makes it a much bigger game than it seems to be. And making a game of this scale requires a lot of money and working part-time on it simply doesn't cut it.</p>
<p>We are fully committed and have always been puttin in everything that we have into creating Stellar Stars. However, we do not want to just ask for money. We want you to be a part of this journey. We want your voice and opinion in Stellar Stars. </p>
<p>We want your entire journey with us to be as transparent as possible. And that's why we often have <b><a href=""http://twitch.tv/WhiteSponge"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">live game development streams on TwitchTV</a></b>!</p>
<p>And as part of being open and transparent, here is a chart that breakdowns how the funds will be distributed:</p>
<p><br/></p>

<br/><p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Why $5000?</b></h3>
<p>$5000 is the bare minimum we need to survive for the coming months. Once we are able to finish Stellar Stars and release it ourselves, everything should be alright!</p>
<p>We will also be showing Stellar Stars at as many game conferences and exhibitions as we can. With your support and contribution, hopefully we will reach our goal - releasing a finished Stellar Stars to you!</p>

<b></b><p><b>How often will updates come by?</b><br/></p>
<p>We actually release new game patches twice every week! So we will also be showing everything that we have created when that happens. Stay tuned and feel free to ask us anything in the comments!<br/></p>
<p><b>What about PS3/4, XBox 360/One and Wii U?</b><br/></p>
<p>We'll try our best to release Stellar Stars to as many platforms as possible. But for the moment, we're focused on Windows, Mac and Linux only. We'll update you if this changes.<br/></p>
<p><b>Will the game be translated to other languages?</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes! In fact, in addition to being released in English, Stellar Stars will be translated to Japanese and Mandarin/Chinese. Localization to other languages are not excluded too.</p>

<p>Creating a game as an independent team of game developers comes with its own risks. Possible risks such as not having enough money and not being prepared for unexpected events can happen. </p>
<p>However, we have actually spend a lot of time preparing and making sure that we spend the money and development time as how we have planned it. David comes from an IT background and has many years of experience in managing projects so he knows how to handle a small team.</p>

Quotes:
""Looking awesome for such an early alpha!"" - Indie


""What’s cool is that these spells can only be used if you collect them in the map or after defeating a neutral enemy, the latter being one of the most enjoyable moments in MOBA games."" - Haogamers



""I have only played briefly during Gamestart but I have to say I was impressed for the most part"" - AGamingNation



""Controls felt responsively tight for the most part, and like any good roguelite promises a learning curve that demands skill to progress. The music’s pretty sweet, too"" - GameAxis

""Looks good! I like games that have this clean look. We don’t have enough Japanese indie games on steam. I will definitely buy, since I play a lot of platformers!” - Zeebrax

“Stellar Stars is an indie platformer which i really did like and i hope you like it” - TechnoGamer


We are fully committed to bring you the full experience of Stellar Stars. With that in mind,
Our campaign is set to Fixed Funding. In other words, this is exactly the same as Kickstarter.

If we do not get funded, you will get your money back.


                    
Meet David. He is a game developer with dreams of creating games which everyone can enjoy. 
His plans are foiled when one day, a mysterious portal brings him into the game world that he created.


Now the only way to return to his world is to search for the Star of Records, a legendary existence said to house the memories of everything in the world.


As you fight your way across other players, minions and bosses, you may come to understand why a game developer is stuck in his game in the first place.



Marry two popular genres, take the best out of them and give birth to a game that sets new definitions for them. That is what Stellar Stars is about. And it just works. 
You get the fun and excitement from battling opponent players in a competitive, fast-paced arena in your quest to reach the top leagues. 
The procedurally generated nature of Rogue-lites makes each match a new experience and requires you to quickly think on your feet on how best to maneuver the stages and defeat the other players.


Cooked with passion, these are the game mechanics that make Stellar Stars special:

Fast-Paced Competitive Arena & Procedurally Generated Stages

The combat in Stellar Stars is fast-paced and is constantly changing depending on the world and the minions of it.
You are empowered with:

Basic Wave Attack for high speed ranged attack


Spells for more damage and additional effects


Special Skills that are unique to each of the playable characters

Trophies And League Ranking Ladder
Grab trophies by winning matches! Start from bronze and climb your way up to the top leagues. Become the top 10 in the world if you can!


Learning Character Growths

The essence of Stellar Stars is improving your character in direct and interactive ways through character growths when you level up: increasing your sprinting speed, improving your jumping height and more.

Character growths comes in many forms. From Runner's Feet, which increases your running speed, to Sinker, which accelerates your falling down from reaching the highest point after jumping, they can change how you play Stellar Stars every time.
  +    =  

Unlock-able Characters

When you play Stellar Stars for the first time, you start with the first playable character - Beat.

Armed with equal amounts of health and mana, Beat is your beginner-friendly and the most balanced character in Stellar Stars.  Beat's special skill, the 5-hit combo, releases a furry of attacks on the nearest opponent!
In addition to Beat, you can play as the other characters once you have completed the requirements to unlock them!

Depending on the unlock-able character, you could either defeat a boss or collect enough stars to unlock them!

Crazily Challenging Bosses
What? There are bosses too? Stellar Stars comes packaged with a story mode where you get the chance to challenge crazy bosses. Besides having a huge amount of health, bosses in Stellar Stars comes packaged with an arsenal of varied attacks. From creating earthquakes to breathing out ice, they are not to be reckoned with.

In addition to having multiple attack patterns, bosses in Stellar Stars have the ability to spawn minions!

And what's to stop a boss from teleporting to right above you?



The soundtrack is composed by the extremely talented Bibiki. He is also the music composer for Retro Pixels Castle. Check out the Stellar Stars main theme track that he have composed on Soundcloud:










WhiteSponge is a small team of fun-loving game crafters. We believe that it's important that you really enjoy the experience of playing the games we make.
We are a young game studio and we can get quite crazy about things we care about. If we see something in a game that we are not satisfied with, rest assured that we are the ones who will tear it down and reconstruct it from scratch. 
We believe that anything is possible as long as we are open to learning and be transparent to new experiences. So we are constantly trying out new things to create better gameplay experiences for you.

Why did we start this campaign?


This campaign helps us make our dream come true. While Stellar Stars isn't our first game, our dream is to create an awesome gameplay experience for you. Our passion is in crafting games and we want to express this through Stellar Stars. 
Stellar Stars has a lot of emphasis on gameplay mechanics which makes it a much bigger game than it seems to be. And making a game of this scale requires a lot of money and working part-time on it simply doesn't cut it.
We are fully committed and have always been puttin in everything that we have into creating Stellar Stars. However, we do not want to just ask for money. We want you to be a part of this journey. We want your voice and opinion in Stellar Stars. 
We want your entire journey with us to be as transparent as possible. And that's why we often have live game development streams on TwitchTV!
And as part of being open and transparent, here is a chart that breakdowns how the funds will be distributed:





Why $5000?
$5000 is the bare minimum we need to survive for the coming months. Once we are able to finish Stellar Stars and release it ourselves, everything should be alright!
We will also be showing Stellar Stars at as many game conferences and exhibitions as we can. With your support and contribution, hopefully we will reach our goal - releasing a finished Stellar Stars to you!




How often will updates come by?
We actually release new game patches twice every week! So we will also be showing everything that we have created when that happens. Stay tuned and feel free to ask us anything in the comments!
What about PS3/4, XBox 360/One and Wii U?
We'll try our best to release Stellar Stars to as many platforms as possible. But for the moment, we're focused on Windows, Mac and Linux only. We'll update you if this changes.
Will the game be translated to other languages?

Yes! In fact, in addition to being released in English, Stellar Stars will be translated to Japanese and Mandarin/Chinese. Localization to other languages are not excluded too.


Creating a game as an independent team of game developers comes with its own risks. Possible risks such as not having enough money and not being prepared for unexpected events can happen. 
However, we have actually spend a lot of time preparing and making sure that we spend the money and development time as how we have planned it. David comes from an IT background and has many years of experience in managing projects so he knows how to handle a small team.


Want to interact with us directly and see how the game is being made? Or just want to ask us anything about Stellar Stars? Watch our TwitchTV channel when we go live multiple times every week! Our regular live streaming schedule is as follows:
Monday: 10pm to 12pm EST
Tuesday: 10pm to 12pm EST
Wednesday: Tentatively
Thursday: 10pm to 12pm EST
Friday: Tentatively
Saturday: Tentatively
Sunday: 10pm to 12pm EST





If you like what you are seeing, and you want to help make Stellar Stars a reality, spread the word by telling your friends, your family and the world! Without you, we would not be here today. We are grateful for your support and we want you to be part of this journey!
So let's create Stellar Stars together!",64.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Mike Hibbert and I'm the lead developer and project manager for La Vida an open source game much like The Sims which will be available for free under the GPL3 open source licence. Thats free for everyone to download and play!</p>
<p>La Vida lets you control the life of your 'Dude' or 'Dudette', having them interact with the world you create and the community of Dudes you control.</p>
<p>The La Vida project has been a labour of love for me but as time has gone by I've been unable to continue developing because of my day job getting in the way.</p>
<p>To develop La Vida to playable state would take me a year of fulltime development and a bunch of freelance 3d artists to create content for the game itself.</p>
<p>Without funding this very much requested project can't progress. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To develop the game to a fully playable and enjoyable experience that can be played on Windows, Mac &amp; Linux, (possibly even mobile if I can fit it in!) I will need the proposed funding to cover my living costs for 12 months and the costs of paying some freelancers to make 3d models/animations, music and artwork</p>
<p>Users will be able to download a full playable game with free content and open source artwork, models and music so they can even hack the game into something new if they want to!</p>
<p>Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sandbox - build you home any way you want!</li>
<li>Editable Terrain - landscape all you want!</li>
<li>Expanable activities - new activities can be included as they are developed</li>
<li>Import you Dude into you friends game!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>La Vida is a a very much requested game that users on Windows, Mac and Linux would love to enjoy, checkout the unbuntu forums thread which has been going for 4 years now!</p>

<h3>The way forward...</h3>
<p>Well theres lots to be done ... all we need is the time to do it!</p>
<p>Whats in the plan:</p>
<p>Take the existing code and convert it to use a more well supported graphics platform in the initial months.</p>
<p>Once thats complete there is support for interaction with household objects so that activities can be performed.</p>
<p>Work needs to be done later to provide feedback to the player about events, their status in the game and loads more!</p>

<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>Once plugged in, Mineblock looks for a network to connect to. If your network is password-protected Mineblock creates its own temporary network which can be accessed by phone or laptop, allowing you to log Mineblock in to your network. Once restarted, Mineblock connects to your network and provides a Minecraft gaming environment. Crafters will be able to log into the game by typing in Mineblock’s IP address into their laptops.</p>
<h5>Do you see the value in having children play Minecraft?<br/>

<p>Minecraft can allow for ""Open to LAN"" games but they are dependant on a single gaming console to exist.

<p>During this campaign we aim to reach our first 100 orders of Mineblock at a wholesale price.

I'd like to thank my good friend, Afshin Mehin of Woke Design and Jason Miller, a former student from Emily Carr University of Art + Design, where I teach. Along with the folks at MakerLabs, they were incredibly helpful in supporting my endeavours through the prototyping of Mineblock.
Additionally, a big shout out goes out to my old time friend Anthony Baird for his video editing mastery and Carlos Flores for helping shoot the video.
Thanks for your help",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our main reasons why we need your support:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3> We need to acquire two Unity 3D Pro Licenses + Team License which adds up to $3500 (in order to deliver the best ingame effects and functionalities available).</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>We need other licenses as well, for the tools we are using to develop (3D modeling, animation, image manipulation, optimization tools). Play fair! No piracy!</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>We still need to get some 3D assets, plugins and sound effects. Also we need another programmer and to pay for the concept art.</h3>

<li>
<h3>PROMOTION! That is the key to success. We want the world to know and live this new game experience.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>  </p>
<h2>
<strong>What happens if we get over-funded?</strong> </h2>
<ul>
<li>We will buy licenses to develop for iOS, Android and if possible a Wii License.</li>
<li>We also have 6 more projects in the queue, so any extra cash will go directly to our next project.</li>
<li>We will be able to hire a service Unity Studios offers, which is to optimize the game (this means: the game will be suitable for older machines, but still look good enough).</li>
<li>We are in Costa Rica, and even though we have talent, it is hard to get support here. We want to support indie developers in our country as well.</li>
<li>I mentioned promo, right?

		Notre objectif principal est d'amasser 12 000€. Grâce à vos contributions, nous serons capable de vous fournir une version pro de Gambrinus pour début 2014.
		Our main goal is to raise € 12,000. With your contributions, we will be able to provide you with a pro version of Gambrinus in early 2014.
	

		Pourquoi un tel financement ? Le coût de production du jeu, les illustrations, le livret de règles, le packaging et les frais d'envois. Tout ceci n'est pas gratuit... 
		N'étant pas une maison d'édition j'essaye de faire connaitre mon jeu et surtout le partager avec vous. Avec vos contributions ce projet aboutira avec vous !
		Why such funding? The cost of production of the game, artwork, rulebook, packaging and postage costs. All this is not free ... 
		Not being a publishing house I try to know my game and especially to share it with you. With your contributions this project will result with you!

		Une fois notre objectif de financement principal atteint, tous les contributeurs qui ont pré-commandé Gambrinus auront la possibilité de recevoir une version imprimable prêt à jouer.
		Note: Cette version PDF prête à jouer du jeu n'inclut pas le design final.
		Une fois que vous avez fait votre contribution (d'un montant minimum de 5€), vous pouvez si vous le souhaitez, nous envoyer un courriel à gambrinusboardgame@gmail.com et demander vos fichiers.
		Once our main funding goal has been reached, all contributors who have pre-ordered Gambrinus will have the option to receive a Print and Play version of the game.
		Note : The PnP PDF version of the game does not include the final artwork.
		Once you've made your contribution (a minimum of €5), you can email us at gambrinusboardgame@gmail.com and request your files.

Guess what?  It's <strong><font style=""color: #5dc8af;"">memee</font></strong>!
<br/><br/>
We're a group of players -- often called The Novad(s) -- from the <a href=""http://revplay.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RevPlay</a> radical game collective.  We're trying to bring a new game into the world.  It's a social game based on asking revolutionary questions like
<br/><br/>- How would you describe the experience of eating chocolate to someone with no taste buds?<br/>
- In the 2012 U.S. presidential election, would you rather vote for <a href=""http://www.nobodyforpresident.org/index2012.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nobody</a>...or Everybody?<br/>- If we need more radicals to make revolution, how do you make radical babies?<br/><br/>
Occupy Wall Street has taught us that every revolution begins with a question and some people who are ready to play something new.  Now we want to spread the <strong><font style=""color: #5dc8af;"">memee</font></strong> meme we all found through
OWS all around the US!  It's going to be a bit like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travels_with_Charley:_In_Search_of_America"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Travels with Charley</a>; instead of bringing a dog, we've got our hypoallergenic game to help us learn about the making of another American revolution.
<br/><br/>
We'll be documenting the journey and the evolution of this game with <a href=""http://travelswithmemee.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a fancy little blog</a> featuring things like imagination maps (exploring the new mental cartography), audio recordings of our <strong><font style=""color: #5dc8af;"">memee</font></strong> sessions, which we'll be sharing over the internet, and a ""Book o' Wisdom"" for preserving all the knowledge that we collect.  
<br/><br/>
By the end, we'll have a biography of <strong><font style=""color: #5dc8af;"">memee</font></strong>, from its beginning and its initial evolution, that will also be a story and a portrait of the people we meet.  We'll release the book in a number of 10-20 page chapters in both the physical and digital formats.
<br/><br/>
We believe that play can be a form of art.  Play can actually create a new culture.  And <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE1DuBesGYM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">play may be the future of Civilization</a>. So please help us <strong><font style=""color: #5dc8af;"">memee</font></strong> with you.  Let's all play together!

Kevin came to Liberty Plaza in September, a few days into the occupation, with the same questions everyone had. Who are these people? What do they want? As he walked past the people holding signs around the perimeter, the questions continued, ""How is this different?"", ""Where are the leaders?"". Looking around at the clusters of people sitting in neat circles, communicating patiently with words and hand-signals, he saw what seemed like some answers. It turned out to be more questions!!! ""What do I have to say?"", ""Is there something I could do?"". From that point, he spent every day in the park- asking questions, answering other people's questions with more questions (e.g. Stranger: ""What are your demands!?"" Kevin: ""Oooooh!! What are YOUR demands!?""). To Kevin, the most striking thing about Occupy Wall Street was never the answers being given but rather the mystery of the response. The ideas expressed in the park are hardly new or controversial; what WAS new and controversial was the nature by which the park drew people in. By playing a game of questions and challenges-- by seeing a dangling conversational thread as invitation to pull instead of mend, the intellectual straightjackets could be unraveled instead of reinforced. Kevin feels that this is the most important tool the Occupy Movement has created: empowering people not by merely sharing one's own knowledge or opinion, but by offering space and time for reflection, creation, curiosity, and support. Kevin feels this idea is consistent with the revolutionary heritage of Jesus, Ghandi, Kierkegaard, and Gutierrez, and it is in the spirit of those counter-intuitive methods he wants to rediscover America.<br/><br/><strong>EXPENSES:</strong><br/><br/>

Absolutely!Herbert's Quest is a small passion project of mine, that takes place in a medieval setting. It's a satire of both crowd funding and RPG's. It contains a lot of black humor and is guaranteed** to make you laugh! ** Laughter is not guaranteed in countries where unavailable..As you go around the medieval village, you'll be helping a group of adventurers in their crowd funding effort. You'll go on a quest to help our townsfolk, in a mysterious dungeon, meet plenty of interesting characters, and go on an epic journey to fund your adventures!
How did it all begin?


In December 2014 there was a sale on unity medieval assets, and I wanted to see if it is possible to use only these assets to make an awesome game just with these them, and do it in a very short time.
This is the sale as it appeared on the asset store.

https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/sale

The relevant assets from this sale that are usable in  an adventure game total to  $377.5.

I launched the campaign and bought this character. Soon after, David Melanson contributed $500 and chose the name ""Herbert The Hero"" for him, and thus Herbert's Quest was born.






Initially, I made a prototype just a few hours:
Click here to play Medieval Madness Asset Adventure Game Prototype #6



Which was based on an even earlier prototype:



I got our main character walking around talking to NPC's  shortly after launching the campaign.




The assets available are really great. This inspired me to have Herbert look for magical items in the dungeon we got:




Using only the assets available I am attempting to write this existing character 3D model into a strong independent female character based on this model. It's a real challenge. She is based on a friend of mine Infy Snow, who is a talented musician.



Herbert will meet Dr. Infy Snow, the alchemist as he goes around the dungeon looking for magical items after his conversation with Astrid, Pollo Diablo, the village's sorceress and a big supporter of crowd funded adventures like Herbert's.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail: <strong>Ok.</strong></p>
<ul><li>Explain how much funding you need and where it's going.

In fact, ABC7 News found out, it's a pastime that's become so universal some think it could even bring about world peace."" - ABC7 News""There are places in the world where hatred hangs in the air, like floating motes. It is breathed in and it is breathed out. It is borne aloft by suspicion and distrust of the other... Justin Hefter has been working to establish empathy between people since his days as a student at Stanford, where he organized a social group designed to increase understanding between Muslim and Jewish students."" - Polygon""For conflicts where “othering” and alienation is the norm, an experience that establishes a fellow player as a human being and potential partner could lay the foundation for further peacebuilding action."" - PeaceTech Lab

Our mission is to use cooperative games as a way to create connections, empathy and friendships for people around the world. Bandura Games was founded by an American, Israeli and Palestinian team. We’ve since grown to over 10 people. We are 40% women. We are Jewish, Muslim and Christian. We are black, white and brown. We are gay and straight. We are the change we want to see in the world.Fun should have no borders, so join us in our campaign to have #FunWithoutBorders!





People in Different Countries Around The World Can Play RunZoo Together

Most social networks and games allow people to play and connect with people they already know. Our games connect people with players from around the world. 
For every $5 that you donate, we can reach 1 more person and create 1 new connection through our game!


The more that we raise, the more friendships we can help create for people around the world!
By pairing people who would never otherwise interact, we are allowing our players to create diverse friend networks.
Because our games are cooperative, meaning that players play on the same team, they start to develop trust with one another. Players quickly learn that they are able to cooperate and develop relationships with people from countries and cultures that they have never experienced before.



In our game RunZoo, you play an animal who is escaping the zoo, and running to a tropical paradise where the animal kingdom lives in peace and harmony. In order to make it without being caught, you need to partner with your other animal friends (real players from around the world). You and your partner have to work together in order to be more successful and you are encouraged to share resources, complete joint missions, and save each other's lives.

Only after you successfully partner with someone do you then get to learn who they are, where they are playing from, and what you both have in common. You have the opportunity to add that person as a friend in our game and receive +100 extra coins for doing so!RunZoo let's players learn about what they have in common with one another so they are more likely to want to play together again and develop friendships. 


Players work together and save each other's lives in the game. 
The cooperative nature of our game increases the likelihood that players will develop the trust that can form the basis of a friendship.

<p>Cats are always interested in new options yet short of endurance. Searching for new toys is then agonizing, so we start to ponder the possibility of a toy with a lasting charm. And, the idea of creating this fun and play-on toy sparked. Working with a group of cat lovers, WANT-i came to life! With all the indispensable elements cats long for, we finally make a toy with at least 6 playing ways, so your precious cats can always find the grass green.</p>

<div>When
brainstorming a name for our novel concoction, we decided to make it easy and
simple, just to keep the essences. No knickknacks. No hazards. We just <span><b>WANT</b> to provide her Majesty the most <b>i</b>nteresting, <b>i</b>nnovative,
and <b>i</b>rresistible toy. Then, here goes <b>WANT-i.</b></span><br/>

<p>Embellished with fresh light green, the white console is pleasing to
the eye. WANT-i will become an adorable addition to your house.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444026218/ntqy60feiqojvfcegtdc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We came up with this wonderful idea and then let the French designer
deal with its outlook. If you look closer from the top, you can find a cat’s
eye, or a scratch of the cat. As a toy, WANT-i starts the fun from the
appearance.</p>

We believe little things make a big difference, so WANT-i not only provides the
fun to your cats but also makes the owners appreciate it. The remote control of
WANT-i replaces the traditional, boring design with a cute look of the cat paw,
so using it will be like having a contact with your cats.<br/>
<br/>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444208668/wz2onghudvc3bxjwmpcr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>
<p>With multiple play modes, WANT-i has equipped with high playfulness
for our cats. Yet, we still feel there should be some more gadgets to better
our device. Then, we add a randomization feature to the play modes, so the cats
can never guess what comes next and thus create even more fun!</p>

Not only that, WANT-i offers extra interactivity between the owner and the pet. The
owners can choose to play simply with their cats with the included cat teaser
or the laser pointer. Or, they can use the remote to control the console from a
distance.<br/>

pets.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: left; color: #51AF5B;"">When will I receive the order?</h3>
<p>With all our efforts, we aim to deliver WANT-i to all our backers in February, 2016.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left; color: #51AF5B;"">How’s WANT-i charged?</h3>
<p>The console is charged by only 3 AA batteries, and the remote control requires 2 AAA batteries.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left; color: #51AF5B;"">How long do the batteries last?</h3>
<p>Both the console and the remote control require the use of batteries. Normally, it takes about one week to change the batteries for the console, and a month for the remote. The real situation is up to the usage and conditions.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left; color: #51AF5B;"">Where is the device produced?</h3>
<p>WANT-i is manufactured in Taiwan.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left; color: #51AF5B;"">How do I replace the teaser in the future?</h3>
<p>As long as the stick of the new teaser is thinner than 5mm, it should be compatible with the console of WANT-i.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left; color: #51AF5B;"">When is the best time to use WANT-i?</h3>
<p>Well, anytime! Nevertheless, according to the research, cats dine around the dawn and the dusk, and these are the times they hype with the hungers to chase. Therefore, we advise you to utilize WANT-i around these times.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left; color: #51AF5B;"">Will the machine automatically shut down?</h3>
<p>Yes, we equip WANT-i with the wise auto shutdown feature. If the device has been started for ten minutes, the spinning function will be off to prevent the battery exhaustion.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left; color: #51AF5B;"">Is the device working quietly?</h3>
<p>We’ve strived to eliminate the noise of our cat toy, so the console would only contain some sounds caused by the electric motor. Besides the motor sound, there might be a chance that you encounter louder squeaking sounds if your pets block the movement of the device. This is due to the safety mechanism we specifically design to protect your pets from snapping by the machine, so don't worry about it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444208765/qj2qbrhrbx6ji0y95dcv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With our goal of providing the safety and pleasure in mind, we’ve strived for almost two years, and we’re more than glad to announce the molding has coming to the perfection.
</p>
<p>We look forward to introducing WANT-i to all the cat lovers. Though working with an experienced maker and having tested our design for a long period of time grant us confidence in our production plan, we will never sacrifice your satisfaction in the mass production.</p>
<p>We will try our best to deliver the perfected product to you in January, 2016. Nevertheless, should there be any unanticipated issues, please be a bit patient with us.</p>
<p>We will update any latest information about the production, so you won’t miss it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444208779/xkx3oss32afcitztl2zh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We care about not only our own cats but also the cats around us. In Taiwan, there are more than 120,000 stray cats, and the amount is increased by 20% every year. This has caused concerns regarding the environment and the cats caring.</p>
<p>Presently, it is advised to utilize the Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) program to humanely and effectively control the number of stray animals and thus sustain the quality of the environment and the pets caring.</p>
<p>Not only that, TNR can reduce about 50% of the government budget using on animal control.WANT-i wants to be part of it. With every WANT-i sold, we will donate 1% of the sale to Stray Cats TNR Association, Taiwan, which has been promoting the TNR programs around Taiwan and has helped at least 15,000 stray cats.

Cats are always interested in new options yet short of endurance. Searching for new toys is then agonizing, so we start to ponder the possibility of a toy with a lasting charm. And, the idea of creating this fun and play-on toy sparked. Working with a group of cat lovers, WANT-i came to life! With all the indispensable elements cats long for, we finally make a toy with at least 6 playing ways, so your precious cats can always find the grass green.




When
brainstorming a name for our novel concoction, we decided to make it easy and
simple, just to keep the essences. No knickknacks. No hazards. We just WANT to provide her Majesty the most interesting, innovative,
and irresistible toy. Then, here goes WANT-i.





Embellished with fresh light green, the white console is pleasing to
the eye. WANT-i will become an adorable addition to your house.

We came up with this wonderful idea and then let the French designer
deal with its outlook. If you look closer from the top, you can find a cat’s
eye, or a scratch of the cat. As a toy, WANT-i starts the fun from the
appearance.

We believe little things make a big difference, so WANT-i not only provides the
fun to your cats but also makes the owners appreciate it. The remote control of
WANT-i replaces the traditional, boring design with a cute look of the cat paw,
so using it will be like having a contact with your cats.



With multiple play modes, WANT-i has equipped with high playfulness
for our cats. Yet, we still feel there should be some more gadgets to better
our device. Then, we add a randomization feature to the play modes, so the cats
can never guess what comes next and thus create even more fun!

Not only that, WANT-i offers extra interactivity between the owner and the pet. The
owners can choose to play simply with their cats with the included cat teaser
or the laser pointer. Or, they can use the remote to control the console from a
distance.


To multiply the fun, here we suggest some methods for you and your
pets.

Spinning : 
With the agile movement of the bait spinning on the fishing stick, your cats can
fully enjoy the hunt.




Slithering : 
Take
the stick off the console and rock it on the floor, and you can have a recreational
and intimate moment with your pets.





Wiggling : 
Let
the console wiggle the teaser for you, and the cats have the ample fun!





Batting : 
WANT-i
comes with a specially designed bat and ball. Set up the batting mode, and the
moving ball will catch your cats’ eyes!





Ball tracking : 

Even without using the bat, the track in the console will allow the ball to roll
freely, and you can see your cats’ cute little paws patting the ball.








Laser chasing : 
Mixing
the laser with the multiple play modes of WANT-i provides sufficient exercise
and ample fun for your cats, and, of course, you, the owner.














When will I receive the order?
With all our efforts, we aim to deliver WANT-i to all our backers in February, 2016.
How’s WANT-i charged?
The console is charged by only 3 AA batteries, and the remote control requires 2 AAA batteries.
How long do the batteries last?
Both the console and the remote control require the use of batteries. Normally, it takes about one week to change the batteries for the console, and a month for the remote. The real situation is up to the usage and conditions.
Where is the device produced?
WANT-i is manufactured in Taiwan.
How do I replace the teaser in the future?
As long as the stick of the new teaser is thinner than 5mm, it should be compatible with the console of WANT-i.
When is the best time to use WANT-i?
Well, anytime! Nevertheless, according to the research, cats dine around the dawn and the dusk, and these are the times they hype with the hungers to chase. Therefore, we advise you to utilize WANT-i around these times.
Will the machine automatically shut down?
Yes, we equip WANT-i with the wise auto shutdown feature. If the device has been started for ten minutes, the spinning function will be off to prevent the battery exhaustion.
Is the device working quietly?
We’ve strived to eliminate the noise of our cat toy, so the console would only contain some sounds caused by the electric motor. Besides the motor sound, there might be a chance that you encounter louder squeaking sounds if your pets block the movement of the device. This is due to the safety mechanism we specifically design to protect your pets from snapping by the machine, so don't worry about it.

With our goal of providing the safety and pleasure in mind, we’ve strived for almost two years, and we’re more than glad to announce the molding has coming to the perfection.

We look forward to introducing WANT-i to all the cat lovers. Though working with an experienced maker and having tested our design for a long period of time grant us confidence in our production plan, we will never sacrifice your satisfaction in the mass production.
We will try our best to deliver the perfected product to you in January, 2016. Nevertheless, should there be any unanticipated issues, please be a bit patient with us.
We will update any latest information about the production, so you won’t miss it.

We care about not only our own cats but also the cats around us. In Taiwan, there are more than 120,000 stray cats, and the amount is increased by 20% every year. This has caused concerns regarding the environment and the cats caring.
Presently, it is advised to utilize the Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) program to humanely and effectively control the number of stray animals and thus sustain the quality of the environment and the pets caring.
Not only that, TNR can reduce about 50% of the government budget using on animal control.WANT-i wants to be part of it. With every WANT-i sold, we will donate 1% of the sale to Stray Cats TNR Association, Taiwan, which has been promoting the TNR programs around Taiwan and has helped at least 15,000 stray cats.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Here ThomasSquall, the programmer, I'm a 21 years old guy and I'm the founder of BadaSquall Videogames. Our team is composed by a programmer (me), 3 drawers and a music director and we are expanding our members. We are creating a Pokémon game (code written from zero and not a hack) with new characters and a new graphic. We develop for Microsoft (Pc and X-box 360). After this project we are supposed to create new games totally created by us.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My team need funds to buy licences of software that we are using, like photoshop, visual studio and others. After this we will be able to publish our works. The funds are for the team itself and not for the actual project so they are usefull for the future too.</p>

Dodatne kartice kladionice i veta od igrača zahtijevaju i <strong>dobro taktiziranje</strong>, a raznolikost zastupljenih područja općeg znanja onemogućuje igrače jake u samo jednom području da se „prošeću“ do cilja. S obzirom na brojnost kategorija i vrsta prepreka za igrače, pravila su ustvari <strong>jednostavna i pristupačna</strong> pa nije potreban dugotrajan proces upoznavanja mehanike igre.

Nakon brojnih kvizova na području Hrvatske odlučili smo koncept pretočiti u opipljiv proizvod – društvenu igru na ploči koju bismo i sami željeli zaigrati na board game večerima s društvom.Koncept igre u potpunosti smo razvili, dizajn je u finišu, no slijedi financijski najzahtjevniji korak: troškovi tiska za inicijalnu ediciju premašuju naš skroman budžet i tu nam je potrebna vaša pomoć kako bismo igru porinuli u svijet. Ovom kampanjom dobivate priliku uključiti se u realizaciju projekta jer svojom donacijom odnosno predbilježbom za igru nama pomažete pokriti visoke početne troškove tiska (pravog tiska, ne simboličnog printanja iz videa :)), dok sebi po promotivnoj cijeni poklanjate brojne zabavne večeri u društvu originalne igre znanja na ploči, ali i pravo na samohvalu kako ste na vrijeme prepoznali i podržali pravi projekt.  Što je KOZa društvena igraviše od 2.500 pitanja10 kategorija2–16 igrača (2–4 pojedinca ili 2–4 ekipe)dob: 17–117Temeljena na svježem i originalnom konceptu, KOZa društvena igra razlikuje se od popularnih igara sličnog tipa koje ste možda odigrali.Raznovrsnost izazova koje KOZa predstavlja igračima na putu do cilja osigurava dinamičnu i uzbudljivu igru od početka do kraja. Adrenalin i osjećaj anticipacije svakako podiže i mogućnost profitiranja od suparničkih grešaka – što izravno (prilikom da se odgovori na netočno odgovoreno pitanje suparnika), što putem posebnih kartica. Dodatne kartice kladionice i veta od igrača zahtijevaju i dobro taktiziranje, a raznolikost zastupljenih područja općeg znanja onemogućuje igrače jake u samo jednom području da se „prošeću“ do cilja. S obzirom na brojnost kategorija i vrsta prepreka za igrače, pravila su ustvari jednostavna i pristupačna pa nije potreban dugotrajan proces upoznavanja mehanike igre. Isto tako, igrač ili ekipa koji prvi počnu igrati nisu ni u kakvoj prednosti nad suparnicima, što je vrlo važno za pravednost natjecanja.O detaljnim pravilima igre informirajte se u Pravilima te pratite naše objave u kojima ćemo vas pobliže upoznavati s karakteristikama igre.

It’s more than just an entertainment expo; it has an agenda that covers the educational needs and economic development of the industry that now helps different regions of Mexico as well.</p><p>We work all year to create these opportunities (some of us volunteering for free, and some of us pro-bono). And once a year, we have our annual event that consists of 5 sub-events:</p><ul>
<li>Business meeting</li>
<li>Symposium (Conferences and workshops)</li>
<li>Startup Weekend (Hackathon)</li>
<li>Expo</li>
<li>Videogames music concert with a symphony orchestra</li>
</ul><p>This year we have our annual event on Nov 4-6, 2016, in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, at the Convention Center of the Centro Estatal de las Artes. And we certainly need your support. This is an event that is partly funded by the Federal Government, but only enough to cover 50% of the cost. And with the current exchange rate of the dollar vs the peso, this only make things a little harder for us to cover everything.</p><p>Before moving on to the details of the event, I would like to tell you a story, it’s a little long, but it’s totally worth to stick to the end, so you could appreciate why we do this, why every year we work to create opportunities for students, and Mexican development companies, why we put so much passion, heart and soul into this initiative.</p><p>I'm often asked what one of the most relevant stories of Gamacon is. There are two really good stories, but for now, I will stick with only one, which I believe has had the most impact on me personally. The first Gamacon expo was created in March 2008, and for the gala closing event, we did a very famous videogames music concert the first time in Mexico that we will call SFVMC (some famous videogames music concert). So many things went wrong, my team and I weren't ready for a 1000 people expo, and the complicated music concert that was SFVMC.</p><p>Financially, I lost a lot of money. My two passions together in one event: Music and Videogames. I didn’t want to know anything about them; I didn’t want to know anything about Gamacon. But for the people that attended, they were really impressed with the expo, and thanks to the support of the SFVMC production team, the concert was mind blowing for them. They didn’t know everything that went wrong.</p><p>At the end of the concert one of the co-creator of SFVMC wanted to talk to me, and asked me why so many things went wrong. I humbly said that we were only a group of friends that wanted to make a great videogames expo, and ended up lacking the experience to deliver what we needed, that we failed. Strangely he replied that he didn’t see it that way, that he believed we did a great job. He continued saying that every show he goes to, the staff is more than 50 people, and we were only 7 for the expo and the concert. He said: “How did you guys do it? It’s incredible. Yes, many things were wrong, but you have a great team.” ”I would have never thought of doing a show in Mexicali, since it’s not a huge metropolis”. And I asked, then why did you come? He replied that the way I spoke to him about what we wanted to achieved, how we wanted to create the opportunities that we didn’t have when we were younger to create videogames as a living, how we wanted Mexico to be an important pillar in the videogames industry, the passion with which I described every detail of the project, made him believed that one day Gamacon would be one of the most important videogames expo in Mexico, and that he wanted to be part of the beginning of it. He finished by saying: “The videogames industry couldn’t be in better hands than yours.” At that precise moment, I loved music and videogames again. And I said to myself that my team and I would learn from our mistakes and continue with Gamacon!</p><p>Fast forward to 2016, Gamacon today is an initiative that is supported by the Mexican Federal Government, an initiative that has been adopted by the Baja California State Government, the IT cluster, the private sector and the state Universities. It’s an initiative that welcomes nearly 4500 people, development studios from different parts of the world and Mexican development studios from different states of Mexico, that helps hundreds of Universities students following their dream of making videogames. We have achieved so much and created many opportunities in the past years, but we’re just getting started and we need your support to create and achieve more!!!</p><p>Linked to the Baja California IT Cluster, the Secretariat of Economy, ProMexico, ProSoft, the Mexican Association of Information Technologies Industry, the Convention and Tourism Committee, educational institutes, and the private sector, we converge all the activities related to video games and unified all efforts, planning and coordinating them to reach a common goal. The common goal is to prepare the talent and generate business opportunities for all Mexican development studios, helping to nurture and foster the growth of companies in this industry, making Mexico an important pillar of this industry in the world.</p><p>This year will be the 7th edition of GAMACON (we skipped 2012 &amp; 2013), every year getting bigger and more important for this industry, and it’s currently called the most important event north of Mexico.</p><p>Now let’s talk more details about each of our sub-events:</p><p><strong>BUSINESS MEETING – MEET THE INDUSTRY</strong></p><p>At business roundtables, meet with game developers and artist from Mexico and other parts of the world, educational institutes, regional committees, and the government institutions in charge of the economic development of the State.</p><p>This is one of most important events of Gamacon. Here we get together with the Mexican Government, Universities, Mexican development studios and foreign studios and discuss about the different projects and business opportunities that we can create, as well of some business-to-business meeting between the participants.</p><p><strong>SYMPOSIUM - INDUSTRY INSIGHTS</strong></p><p>Conferences and workshops targeted at University students and current developers alike put them on the path to success.</p><p>Gamacon provides the opportunity for the audience to hear professionals’ experiences, learning about trends and identify opportunities within this industry.</p><p>We are expecting about 900 students this year to take advantages of the different conferences and workshops that we’re preparing for them.</p><p>Here’s a list of our confirmed speakers:</p><p> </p><p>Alex Gonzalez – Entrepreneur/Author</p><p>“Entrepreneurship: Follow your dreams”</p><p> </p><p>Roy Wooley – Visual effects expert</p><p>“From a though to reality, the creative process”</p><p> </p><p>Richie Bisso – CTO Hyperkinetics Studios</p><p>“The creativity behind decision making”</p><p> </p><p>Luis Fernando Martinez – Mexico country manager Razer USA Ltd</p><p>“From a Startup to a solid and self-sustainable company”</p><p> </p><p>Kiyoshi Tsuru – ESA Mexico representative TMI Law</p><p>“The videogames industry in Mexico as a business”</p><p> </p><p>Gabriel Reyes – CEO iDigital</p><p>“What goes with creating an idea?”</p><p> </p><p>Rob GilesRitter &amp; Jessie Cano – CEO &amp; Studio Manager Haiku Studio</p><p>“The creative process to produce an indie videogame”</p><p> </p><p>Harish Rao – Executive producer Monster VR</p><p>“VR/AR creative process in indie development”</p><p> </p><p>Luis Daniel Ramirez – Voice Actor LolaMx</p><p>“Localization services: a sustainable business in Mexico”</p><p> </p><p>Yoshitomo Moriwaki – CCO Hyperkinetic Studios</p><p>“The different ways you can be a game designer in the video games industry”</p><p> </p><p>More to come….but we need your support!</p><p> </p><p><strong>EXPO - IT’S ALL ON DISPLAY</strong></p><p>On the expo floor, the industry meets the consumer!</p><p>Universities and studios promote their programs, demos and services.</p><p>Additional activities feature cosplay, videogame tournaments, art galleries, wrestling matches, live music, meet &amp; greet with special guests from the film and videogames industry, and more!</p><p>Special guests invited:</p><p>Gerard K Marino – Music composer for the God of War series</p><p>Shota Nakama – Music arranger for Final Fantasy.

It’s an initiative that welcomes nearly 4500 people, development studios from different parts of the world and Mexican development studios from different states of Mexico, that helps hundreds of Universities students following their dream of making videogames. We have achieved so much and created many opportunities in the past years, but we’re just getting started and we need your support to create and achieve more!!!Linked to the Baja California IT Cluster, the Secretariat of Economy, ProMexico, ProSoft, the Mexican Association of Information Technologies Industry, the Convention and Tourism Committee, educational institutes, and the private sector, we converge all the activities related to video games and unified all efforts, planning and coordinating them to reach a common goal. The common goal is to prepare the talent and generate business opportunities for all Mexican development studios, helping to nurture and foster the growth of companies in this industry, making Mexico an important pillar of this industry in the world.This year will be the 7th edition of GAMACON (we skipped 2012 & 2013), every year getting bigger and more important for this industry, and it’s currently called the most important event north of Mexico.Now let’s talk more details about each of our sub-events:BUSINESS MEETING – MEET THE INDUSTRYAt business roundtables, meet with game developers and artist from Mexico and other parts of the world, educational institutes, regional committees, and the government institutions in charge of the economic development of the State.This is one of most important events of Gamacon.

They are the entertainment industry that generates the most revenue worldwide, and we’re missing out.Considering our geographic advantage of Baja California over the rest of Mexico, by being neighbors to the State of California, where most of the leading development studios are based in the US, it’s absurd not to promote and boost this millionaire industry in this State. Under this convenience, several US companies are willing to participate with us by giving conferences and workshops to prepare the talent we need.Business meeting benefits:
New technologies for universities and local and regional studios already established.
New business opportunities
Potential investors.
International promotion of Baja California development studios.
Access to companies (national and international) that will potentially get involved in the different State Chambers.
Business networking with other companies from Mexico, and other parts of the world.
Acquire data as to how Baja California is seen and compared to other parts of Mexico within the industry.
Symposium benefits:
Training in new technologies.
Improve the academic programs of the Universities and the talent of the students.
International acknowledgement of our talent incubation program in this industry.
Opportunities for internships and workshops with visiting companies.
State wide labor resource development in this industry.
Job opportunities for development studios and aspirant candidates.
Expo benefits:
Improve tourism in Mexicali.
Improve business for hotels and restaurants.
Promote commerce for local businesses and companies.
International promotion of the City of Mexicali as a host of important, innovative and attractive events.
Promotion of culture and art.

<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p>It’s a card game where you match symbols on a card in your
hand with symbols on a placed card on the table (or chair or rock or lawn or
friends back or space shuttle or wherever you’re playing). The more symbols
from your card that you can match with the symbols on the placed card, the more
points you score.</p>
<p>The first person to score 21 wins.</p>
<p>Each card is made up of 1 to 3 symbols (square, triangle or
circle).</p>

cards were placed. It’s just plain simple symbol matching. It’s easy!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445896301/wqaieaauyegvizdrsw4l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Ok, explain to me in detail how it works.</b></p>
<p>The game has different variations of play depending on how
difficult you want to make it.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the basic play which is the easiest way of
playing it.</p>
<p>A game consists of a deck of 39 playing cards (standard game) with 1, 2 or 3 symbols on it. The symbols are a combination of Triangles, Circles and Squares.</p>
<p><b>The Setup</b><br/></p>
<p>To begin with, select a person who will deal the first round. This can be the youngest, the oldest, the tallest, the shortest, the one with most hair, the one with no hair or whatever you decide.<br/></p>
<p>The dealer deals each player is 5 cards.</p>
<p>The rest of The Deck is placed face down between the players
and the top card is turned over and placed next to the deck. This is called
“The Pile”. The cards in The Pile are always face up.</p>
<p><b>The Game</b><br/></p>
<p>The player to the left of the dealer starts by selecting a
card from his hand, where as many symbols as possible match the top card in The Pile. For each
symbol the player can match, he or she will score one point.</p>
<p>So if you match 1 symbol, you score one point, if you match
two symbols you score 2 points and so on.</p>
<p>The selected card is placed face up on The Pile and the
player pulls a new card from The Deck.</p>
<p>If a player is unable to place a card, they pull a card from
the Deck and if they still can’t place a card, the turn goes to the next player.</p>
<p>A player who has more than 5 cards on his hand should not
draw a new card from The Deck when they place a card on The Pile during their turn.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Here's an example:</b></p>
<p>The top card on The Pile has a triangle and two squares on it.</p>
<p>You look at the cards in your hand and see that you have a card with two squares and a circle on it. You can match the two squares on your card with the two squares on the top card of The Pile so you play that card. You score two points and take a new card from The Deck and it's the next players turn.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445897041/p6zmr1h6fa5zi5kfpnqe.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 354.121px; height: 246px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The next player has a card with  circle, a triangle and a square on it.<br/>He plays that card and scores 2 points as he can match one circle and one square with the card.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446404147/ynkb9szckidfqzfashfh.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 359.629px; height: 250px;""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b>Variations of Play:</b></p>
<p><b>Medium difficulty</b></p>
<p>A more difficult game would be if each player is dealt only 3 cards. The same rules apply as in the easier game, first player to reach 21 points win. However it's now more difficult to get a card with a matching symbol.</p>
<p><b>Hard difficulty</b></p>
<p>To make things even harder, deal only 2 cards to each player. Again the same rules apply, first to 21 points win.</p>
<p><b>Sudden Death Game</b></p>
<p>This is perhaps the quickest game and will appeal to some players looking for a quick fun game during a break. Each player is dealt 2 cards. There is no score limit in this game. However if you are unable to play a card from your hand, you're not allowed to take another card from The Deck. Instead it's the next players turn. <br/></p>
<p>If that player is able to play a card, then you've lost. However if the next player is unable to play, the turn goes to the following player. <br/></p>
<p>If all players are unable to play a card, the game ends and the person who has scored the most wins the game.<br/></p>
<p><b>The Star Cards</b></p>
<p>Each deck also contains 3 star cards. one 1 star card,  one 2 stars card, and  one 3 stars card.</p>
<p>Players decide before starting the game whether or not they wish to play with the star cards.</p>
<p>These cards have special rules when played. A star card can be played at any time and does obviously not match any symbols in The Pile. The player who plays a Star Card, will automatically score the same amount of points as there are stars on the card.</p>
<p>The next player however, has to play a card with equal amount of symbols. So if a card with 2 stars is played, the next player has to play a card with only two symbols on it.</p>
<p>They also score no points for playing that card.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How far have we got?</b></p>
<p>Well all the card graphics is made (although we may change the colour brightness once we recieve the first test print). Tuck box graphics is all designed too.</p>
<p>We're currently vetting two different printers to see what quality and quantity they can produce. The game RRP etc. is calculated on the prices quoted from the two printers.</p>
<p>Both printers are well established and respected with a large customer base.</p>
<p><b>What will the money be used for?</b></p>
<p>Printing decks of cards! No seriously, that's what we will do for the money if we meet the target. Even if we only get 50 sponsors on here, we will still get 50 decks printed and send them out to you. We'd probably make a huge loss on that but such is life and that's why we're doing flexible funding for this.</p>
<p><b>What if you go over and above your funding?</b></p>
<p>We will print more decks! The funding we're asking for will allow us to print 500 decks and also includes the allowance for shipping world wide.</p>
<p>However, if we go well over an beyond our targets, we will bring forward our plans on a mobile version of the game.</p>
<p><b>Wait, what? A mobile version?</b></p>
<p>Yes, that's right. We have plans on making a mobile version of the game with 1 on 1 multiplayer game-play. The difference with the mobile version of the game is that it includes colour mode play which means you get extra points for matching a blue square with a blue square but only one point for matching a blue square with a non-blue square. <br/></p>
<p>There's a whole bunch of opportunities for mobile games and we'd love to begin development on it as soon as possible. However that cost money and we've decided to take baby steps with this by developing the card game first to see if there's any interest in this.<br/></p>
</div><b>Are there any risks involved?</b><br/><br/>There are always risks. It may turn out to be the biggest flop every and only one of you support us in the end. If we can't get 50 backers, then the money goes back to you. There's no point in us holding on to it. It will mean we lose money on this by paying it all back to you but that's our own fault then.<br/><br/><b>If I back you, will I get the game for Christmas?</b><br/><br/>We would love to say yes to this, but reality is that you won't get it. The end date for this project is end of November and then we need to wait 15 working days for the money raised to reach us. Then it all has to go to print so, realistically you're looking at a mid-January delivery of the first packs.<br/><br/><b>How can you help?</b><br/><br/>Back us and spread the word! Please! Even if you can't back us or don't want to back us, please spread the word about this project.<br/>The more backers we get, the bigger the chance is that we can get this project off the table and in to the printers room.<br/></div>","What is it?

We’ll start with the basic play which is the easiest way of

A game consists of a deck of 39 playing cards (standard game) with 1, 2 or 3 symbols on it. The symbols are a combination of Triangles, Circles and Squares.

symbol the player can match, he or she will score one point.
So if you match 1 symbol, you score one point, if you match
two symbols you score 2 points and so on.
The selected card is placed face up on The Pile and the
player pulls a new card from The Deck.
If a player is unable to place a card, they pull a card from
the Deck and if they still can’t place a card, the turn goes to the next player.
A player who has more than 5 cards on his hand should not
draw a new card from The Deck when they place a card on The Pile during their turn.

Here's an example:
The top card on The Pile has a triangle and two squares on it.
You look at the cards in your hand and see that you have a card with two squares and a circle on it. You can match the two squares on your card with the two squares on the top card of The Pile so you play that card. You score two points and take a new card from The Deck and it's the next players turn.



The next player has a card with  circle, a triangle and a square on it.He plays that card and scores 2 points as he can match one circle and one square with the card.



Variations of Play:
Medium difficulty
A more difficult game would be if each player is dealt only 3 cards. The same rules apply as in the easier game, first player to reach 21 points win. However it's now more difficult to get a card with a matching symbol.
Hard difficulty
To make things even harder, deal only 2 cards to each player. Again the same rules apply, first to 21 points win.
Sudden Death Game
This is perhaps the quickest game and will appeal to some players looking for a quick fun game during a break. Each player is dealt 2 cards. There is no score limit in this game. However if you are unable to play a card from your hand, you're not allowed to take another card from The Deck. Instead it's the next players turn. 
If that player is able to play a card, then you've lost. However if the next player is unable to play, the turn goes to the following player. 
If all players are unable to play a card, the game ends and the person who has scored the most wins the game.
The Star Cards
Each deck also contains 3 star cards. one 1 star card,  one 2 stars card, and  one 3 stars card.
Players decide before starting the game whether or not they wish to play with the star cards.
These cards have special rules when played. A star card can be played at any time and does obviously not match any symbols in The Pile. The player who plays a Star Card, will automatically score the same amount of points as there are stars on the card.
The next player however, has to play a card with equal amount of symbols. So if a card with 2 stars is played, the next player has to play a card with only two symbols on it.
They also score no points for playing that card.

How far have we got?
Well all the card graphics is made (although we may change the colour brightness once we recieve the first test print). Tuck box graphics is all designed too.
We're currently vetting two different printers to see what quality and quantity they can produce. The game RRP etc. is calculated on the prices quoted from the two printers.
Both printers are well established and respected with a large customer base.
What will the money be used for?
Printing decks of cards! No seriously, that's what we will do for the money if we meet the target. Even if we only get 50 sponsors on here, we will still get 50 decks printed and send them out to you. We'd probably make a huge loss on that but such is life and that's why we're doing flexible funding for this.
What if you go over and above your funding?
We will print more decks! The funding we're asking for will allow us to print 500 decks and also includes the allowance for shipping world wide.
However, if we go well over an beyond our targets, we will bring forward our plans on a mobile version of the game.
Wait, what? A mobile version?
Yes, that's right. We have plans on making a mobile version of the game with 1 on 1 multiplayer game-play. The difference with the mobile version of the game is that it includes colour mode play which means you get extra points for matching a blue square with a blue square but only one point for matching a blue square with a non-blue square. 
There's a whole bunch of opportunities for mobile games and we'd love to begin development on it as soon as possible. However that cost money and we've decided to take baby steps with this by developing the card game first to see if there's any interest in this.
Are there any risks involved?There are always risks. It may turn out to be the biggest flop every and only one of you support us in the end. If we can't get 50 backers, then the money goes back to you. There's no point in us holding on to it. It will mean we lose money on this by paying it all back to you but that's our own fault then.If I back you, will I get the game for Christmas?We would love to say yes to this, but reality is that you won't get it. The end date for this project is end of November and then we need to wait 15 working days for the money raised to reach us. Then it all has to go to print so, realistically you're looking at a mid-January delivery of the first packs.How can you help?Back us and spread the word! Please! Even if you can't back us or don't want to back us, please spread the word about this project.The more backers we get, the bigger the chance is that we can get this project off the table and in to the printers room.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The english version of this text can you read below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wir sind Axel und Trang und sind beide Studenten aus Deutschland. Außerdem ist in unserem Team noch ein begabter, junger Manga Zeichner Patrick. Eines Abends kam uns eine Idee. Wir wollten ein Kartenspiel für Mädchen machen! (natürlich können es auch Jungs oder Erwachsene spielen)</p>
<p> Das Produkt unseres Vorhabens nennt sich <strong>FAMY</strong>.</p>
<p> Zunächst: <em>was ist <strong>FAMY</strong> überhaupt?</em></p>
<p> Wie schon erwähnt ist es ein Kartenspiel. Die Karten können im Laden gekauft und somit gesammelt werden. Ein Päckchen beinhaltet 6 Karten.</p>
<p>Thematisch handelt es sich dabei um Feen, die bestimmte Kräfte haben.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Und so sehen die ersten Entwürfe der Sammelkarten aus:</p>
<p><img alt=""card design"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s1.directupload.net/images/130323/s8nvj2td.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""card design""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Warum sollte man Famy spielen?</em></strong></p>
<p><em> </em><strong>Im Zeichen der Gleichstellung</strong>-  <strong>FAMY</strong> soll eine Alternative zu den auf dem  Markt bereits erhältlichen Sammelkartenspielen wie Pokemon oder Yu-Gi-Oh darstellen. Wir sind selbst mit diesen Karten aufgewachsen. Dabei ist uns oft aufgefallen, dass kein Äquivalent für Mädchen auf dem Markt existiert.</p>
<p><strong>Friedlich, aber nicht schwach</strong>- Die Feen haben bestimmte Kräfte. Einerseits können sie sich wehren mit ihren Attacken, andererseits stellen Feen auch friedliche Wesen dar. Kinder können sich oft nicht gegen bestimmte Sachen wehren oder fühlen sich nicht Ernst genommen. Wir wollen ihnen mit den Feen ein wenig Mut schenken.  Denn nur weil man Kind ist, heißt es nicht, dass man sich nicht wehren und eine eigene Stärke beweisen kann. FAMY will hierbei zu einer positiven Ermutigung dienen. </p>
<p> <strong>Was heißt hier „typisch Mädchen“?</strong> – <strong>FAMY</strong> stellt außerdem verschiedene Berufe dar. Fußballerinnen, Pilotinnen, Detektivinnen und viele weitere finden einen Platz in der Reihe der FAMY- Feen. Somit könnte es auch zu einer Förderung der Interessenerweiterung in einem frühen Stadium beitragen. Wir wollen einen kleinen Schritt zur Aufbrechung des sozialtypischen Konsens, was mädchen- oder jungenhaft ist, wagen. Helft uns!</p>
<p> <strong>Strategie lernen</strong>- Neben den verschiedenen Darstellungen von Identitäten und Rollen im gesellschaftlichen Leben, lernt man hier in der spielerischen Interaktion die Fähigkeit zum strategischen Denken. Die Attacken der Feen haben jeweils einen Zahlenwert, der beim „ Gegner“ subtrahiert wird. Der Gegner kann dies ebenfalls tun. Somit lernt man, welche Attacke oder mit welcher Fee der nächsten Schritt im Spiel bestimmt wird. Auch wird hier vorrausschauendes Denken und empathisches Bewusstsein geschult. </p>
<p> <strong>Kreavität fördern</strong> – Da es 100 verschiedene Feen mit unterschiedlichen Charakteren und Berufen gibt und so eine relativ große Bandbreite an Erfahrungen und Variabilität gezeigt wird, kann dies zusätzlich die Kreativität der Kinder fördern. Sie werden erkennen, dass es nicht nur Dinge gibt, die sie aus dem Alltag bei sich zu Hause oder Schule kennen, sondern eine Welt mit Magie und gleichzeitig realen Bezügen. Dies könnte ein Beitrag sein, um den Horizont zu erweitern und die Motivation Eigenes und Neues zu schaffen.</p>
<p>Spaß!- Gerne erinnern wir uns daran, wie wir mit anderen durch diverse Spielkarten das Sammel- und Tauschfieber in uns entdeckten. In den Schulpausen oder zu Hause haben wir damit unsere Zeit verbracht und Freude daran gehabt. Das möchten wir nun auch an die Kinder weitergeben. Neben Computerspielen und Fernseheinflüssen, wollen wir mit <strong>FAMY</strong> wieder etwas Greifbares schaffen.</p>
<p><strong><em>Warum brauchen wir eure Unterstützung?</em></strong></p>
<p> Wir sind beide Studenten, die etwas Eigenes schaffen wollen. Unsere Leidenschaft sind Sammelkarten und das Fieber und die Freude, die damit ausgelöst werden. Aber zwei Menschen können so ein großes Projekt nicht ganz alleine stemmen. Dabei kommt ihr ins Spiel!</p>
<p>Um ein eigenes neues Produkt auf dieser Welt zu etablieren benötigt es an Know How. Bürokratie und Markensicherung sind wichtige Stellen auf diesem Weg dahin.</p>
<p>Auch kann es sehr nützlich sein, eine große Masse an Menschen und hier vor allem Kinder zu erreichen. Helft uns, dass FAMY einen Platz in der Welt erhält! </p>

<p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>
<p>We are Axel and Trang and we are students from Germany. And we want to create a new card game, which can be collected.<br/>A mount of fairies fill the magic world of <strong>FAMY</strong>!</p>
<p>Girls and boys ( and adults) are invited to play the new game!</p>
<p><br/><strong>First things first: What is Famy?</strong></p>
<p>It is a game of cards which can be bought in selected stores. The cards are available in booster packs which contain 6 <strong>FAMY</strong> cards each which need to be collected by the player.</p>
<p>The cards depict different fairies and their specific powers</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is a first version of how the cards are going to look like:</p>
<p><img alt=""card design"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s1.directupload.net/images/130323/s8nvj2td.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""card design""/></p>
<p><strong>Why should you play FAMY?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of equality- FAMY shall offer an alternative to already available card games like Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh. <br/>We grew up with these games ourselves and had to realize that there was nothing similar on the market that covers preferably girls` likes and dislikes.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Amicable, but not weak</strong>- All <strong>FAMY</strong> fairies have certain powers. They can protect themselves by using different attacks, but they are amicable and peaceful creatures by nature. Children/ Kids can feel helpless in certain situations and often have the impression that they are not being taken seriously. With our fairies we want to enhance their self-confidence.<br/>Being a child does not mean that you cannot be brave and stand up for yourself. <strong>FAMY</strong> wants to positively influence this part of growing up.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What do you mean by ""That`s so girly""?</strong></p>
<p><strong>FAMY</strong> depicts a variety of professions. Our fairies are for example soccer players, pilots and investigators. We want to contribute to the development of different interests in a young person neglecting stereotypes of what is considered to be typically ""boyish"" or ""girly"". Please help us with that!</p>
<p><br/><strong>Discover strategy</strong>- Next to learning about different roles and identities in social life, the player can also discover her or his ability to act and think strategically through playful interaction. Each attack of a fairy<br/>is measured as a certain number which has to be subtracted from the ""opponents`"" fairy card. The opponent in return can do the same. This teaches the players how they can influence the outcome of the game with a certain attack or fairy.<br/>FAMY helps that way to train creative and empathetic thinking.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Support creativity</strong>- The <strong>FAMY</strong> world contains 100 fairies with different characters and professions. The thus resulting scope of variety and experiences will promote creativity in childrens` development. They will discover a world of magic with realistic tendencies next to their daily routine at home and in school. This could contribute to widen their horizon and motivate them to create new things of their own.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Fun!</strong>- We like to look back at our own childhood where we discovered our own passion for collecting and trading cards with others.<br/>We filled lunch breaks at school or free time at home with it and loved it. Now, we like to hand that over to our kids. Next to computer games and TV we want to offer with FAMY something ""touchable"" again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why do we need your support?</strong></p>
<p>We are both students who want to create something on our own. Our passion are card games you can collect and the fun and ""fiever"" that is ignited by them. But two people by themselves cannot bring a project as big as this one to life on their own.<br/>This is where you come into play.</p>
<p>It takes the right ""know how"" to establish a new product in this market. Burocracy and branding are important steps to take<br/>to get there.</p>
<p>It is also important to reach a large amount of people, especially kids, to awaken their interest. Please help <strong>FAMY</strong> to get its place in this world.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p><strong>As much as 30 minutes per day is wasted by millions of commuters stuck in traffic due to infrastructure. WhatUpBridge solves this problem by providing proactive alerts and tracking information for the movable infrastructure that may affect your commute. There is currently no major effort to gather or disseminate this data and our vision for WhatUpBridge is to be the data source for the status of critical infrastructure in the US and abroad.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The lack of insight into the status of our infrastructure causes easily avoidable traffic congestion. This problem costs commuters in wasted gas which leads to excessive emissions, employers in lost productivity, and municipalities in lower quality of life for residents. In Miami alone, there is an average of 16,000 commuters per bridge affected every day by busy drawbridges. There are 21 bridges in Miami, New York has an average of 20,000 commuters per bridge with 25 bridges, and Chicago has 43 bridges. That result is over 1.3 million displaced commuters, 650k hours of additional traffic, and millions of dollars in wasted gas and lost business.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What we do, Who we are</strong></p>
<p>We are a company based in Florida that spawn from Hackday Miami in 2011. We won the competition and sponsor prize with our solution which was featured in The Miami Herald. Miami has an issue with the many draw bridges and commuters in our city. As we are a city of waterways and boaters, each day hours of peoples time are wasted waiting for drawbridges to close and allow people to continue on to their destination.</p>
<p>Our solution is simple. Provide the commuter with a notification of a Draw bridges status based on their schedule and selected bridge. If a bridge that you have a schedule for changes status during your set day and time. We will send you a PUSH notification, Text message and/or email to notify you.</p>
<p>We collect the data on the status of bridges via two methods.</p>
<p>1) We are applying for permits to install the sensors we have developed to communicate with our servers, notifying us as to the status of the bridge.</p>
<p>2) We provide a means of feedback thru the mobile application which allows us to collect crowd sourced information as to the status of the bridge.</p>
<p>With these two sources combined we are able to send quality notifications to users.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What makes us unique</strong></p>
<p>We have been approved by the various entities that oversee our bridge and tunnel infrastructure. The US Coast guard, Florida Drawbridge, The Miami Downtown Development Authority, The Miami River commission and the residents of Miami are all behind us to implement our solution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>What we need and what you get</strong><br/><br/>We need $20K to bring WhatUpBridge Mobile to initial release.

<p>Simply put, I’m asking for $1,650 to bring a character from initial concept right though to the point where he can be put into production as a collector’s miniature. What follows is a rundown of the character, the line who I am and where we are as of 16-Nov-2012.</p>
<p><img alt=""Cambric Goayin"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i642.photobucket.com/albums/uu145/Pyre-Studios/Haar/1101-2_zps33619189.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"" title=""Final Miniature""/></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Who is Cambric?</strong></p>
<p>Our first miniature and the focus of this campaign is Cambric Goayin. He is an itinerant Jurist, an adventuring but practical scholar of the law. Since achieving his confirmation over 10 years ago he has travelled the Archipelago by both land and sea lending his expertise to all those in need regardless of station. He inspects the punishment logs of both ships and settlements he visits to ensure that the Maritime laws that govern the island nations are not applied harshly or indeed to lightly.</p>
<p>As an experienced traveller he has learned the hard way what he require on his journeys and carries everything on his person so as not to be a burden to his companions. A scholar more than a warrior he wears no armour but does carry a number of weapons including his large executioners blade. The sword, as much as a symbol of his office as his red coat, has a weight that moves along the blade with each swing lending each stroke fearsome power</p>
<p>The concept of the itinerant jurist is strongly based on the roaming Brehon judges of Irish history specifically between the 7th century when the orals laws of Ireland where written down for first time…</p>
<p><strong>What is the Haar Miniature Line?</strong></p>
<p>The Haar miniature line will contain heroes, villains, beasts and monsters from our Kharybdis Archipelago setting.  The theme of this world is Woodpunk i.e. Steampunk without the steam. It is a setting recovering from a significant war with many opportunities for those souls brave enough to seize them.  We have 36 concepts currently detailed in three series of 12 and artwork for the first series is already underway. Obviously this will take a number of years to get through just those we have planned at this stage.</p>
<p>All of the miniatures within the Haar line will be limited run with a number between 200 and 700 which will depend on the miniature and their associated costs. Once they are gone they are well… gone. I should emphasize that the final product is not just “a nice miniature” we’re aiming for a type of character pack including the miniature, base, concept art, setting cards, details about the characters back story etc… there will be a lot crammed into each one. We’re also currently looking into the legality of including pre-filled digital character sheets for popular RPGs, <em>though this is currently outside the scope of the campaign.</em></p>
<p>The target markets for this line are global thanks to eCommerce. The miniatures themselves will be Heroic 28 to 30mm in scale and as such gamers will be able to use them in most games whether they are RPGs, board games or wargames.  I should also say that I am developing a board game within the same setting and players with any of the Haar miniatures can use them in the game, though they do not need to have them to enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Cambric Colour WIP"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i642.photobucket.com/albums/uu145/Pyre-Studios/Haar/800-cambricWIP.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Colour WIP""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
<p>I’m Darren Barber a long time gamer based in Edinburgh Scotland. For the past 3 years I have been operating Pyre Studios, as a sole trader, a small online retail venture and painting service. I have made the difficult decision to shut down the retail part of the company and transition into the manufacture of my own products. Prior to this I spent 19 years as a project manager within the IT and telecoms sector for some well known multinationals.  </p>
<p>In terms of experience in the manufacture of miniatures and associated products I have none, zip …  nil. I do have close contacts with the manufactures whose products I stocked and they have been very generous with their advice and counsel. While this is a big step for me I feel that it is an informed one. I have already received feedback and constructive criticism on the ideas for this project and I really feel that it’s a go-er.</p>
<h3><strong>How the money will be spent</strong></h3>
<p>Below is a brief breakdown of where the funds will go. Effectively I’m looking to get to a position where the first miniature can be cast. I have a great imagination but no artistic flair (something that constantly frustrates me!) so I have to use far more talented contractors to realize my ideas. In order the money will be spent on;</p>
<ol>
<li>$550: Concepts, art and packaging design</li>
<li>$700: Master miniature sculpt</li>
<li>$100: Resin master print (2)</li>
<li>$300: Mould creation (est)</li>
</ol><p>Points 1 and 2 are hard costs i.e. I have been quoted, accepted and committed to them. Point 3 is for 2 master prints of the sculpt  and this is really a form of risk mitigation as things never go smoothly and my previous experience in retail gave me an insight into how often things get lost or damaged in the post. Point 4 is an estimate for the casting costs based on advice from other manufacturers and early quotes from casters</p>
<h3><img alt=""Cambric Colour Concept"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i642.photobucket.com/albums/uu145/Pyre-Studios/Haar/800-cambric.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Final Colour Concept""/></h3>
<h3><strong>Current Status</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned I have 36 character descriptions accompanied by my own rather “unique” stick figure art. rather than rest on my laurels I have done the following;</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I have commissioned the character concept for Cambric together with character sketches for the ten characters and 2 monsters in  the first Haar series. The ludicrously talented <a href=""http://carloscara.deviantart.com/gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Carlos Cara</a> has done a phenomenal job in capturing the core of each character from sketch to final concept. As these are character studies they do not represent the final pose of the miniatures.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><a href=""http://cargocollective.com/yetiz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Olivier Nkweti</a>, the sculptor for Cambric has done a fantastic job of bringing the miniatures character to life and completed the sculpt on the 14th of December. Olivier is grossly tallented and has previously worked for Rakham, Upperdeck, Privateerpress, Wryd, Infinity, CMON and Dark-Age to name just a few...</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I have approached several other sculptors at the time of writing this to establish a schedule and wow, are they ever busy people? Two further sculptors have expressed an interest and given a rough schedule of when they are available. More details as they are confirmed</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The process of identifying a casting company continues…</p>
<p>While all of this is ongoing I have been continuing to flesh out the setting, its cultures and history, I hope to begin commissioning pieces of setting art early in 2013.</p>

<h3><strong>What will you do if you exceed your funding target?</strong></h3>
<p>Well firstly let’s not jinx it! Secondly while this campaign will be specifically used for Cambric he is just the first in an ongoing line of miniatures. Any additional funds, after potential stretch goals, will be fed directly into that progamme.</p>
<p>The Kharybdis Archipelago setting lends itself to all forms of gaming so developing the context for the Haar line in conjunction with the miniatures seems like the right thing to do.</p>

<h3><strong>What will you do if you do not meet your funding target?</strong></h3>
<p>Honestly? All of the above but over a much longer timescale. I am committed to this range of products and its setting.</p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goals: </strong></h3>
<p>There are 12 miniatures sketched out for Haar Series 1. Being more realistic perhaps I've outlined the first three stretch goals beyond the funding for Cambric. Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves...</p>
<p><img alt=""Sicilaine Stretch Goal"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i642.photobucket.com/albums/uu145/Pyre-Studios/Haar/Stretch-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>$3000:</strong> Haar 1-2: Sicilaine:The next character, Sicilaine: Lady of Waves and Rain, member of the 9 Mother Council, will be included in with the $15 &amp; $22 perks. New sketches and concept art will be commissioned alongside the sculpt. A separate painted perk will be added for her ladyship: <br/><em>Estimated delivery February/March 2013</em></p>
<p><img alt=""Tenril Stretch Goal"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i642.photobucket.com/albums/uu145/Pyre-Studios/Haar/Stretch-2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>$4500:</strong> Haar 1-3: Tenril Mornen: The third character, Tenril Mornen: Seeker of the Aeryil and hero of Daur Fast. Tenril will be included in with the $15 &amp; $22 perks. New sketches and concept art will be commissioned alongside the sculpt. A separate painted perk will be added for this world weary warrior.<br/><em>Estimated delivery February/March 2013</em></p>
<p><img alt=""Steampunk Stretch Goal"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i642.photobucket.com/albums/uu145/Pyre-Studios/Haar/Stretch-3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>$5500: Genre Pack #1: Steampunk. This pack of 12 accessories with a steam punk feel will be added to the $22 &amp; £40 perks. Comprising of ranged and melee weapons and odd looking pieces of equipment this pack will allow you to bring any of the Haar miniatures, or any others for that matter, into your steampunk themed games.<br/><em>Estimated delivery March 2013</em></p>
<p>we have other Genre Packs in the works such as high fantasy and arcane-tech or magi-tech. Each will comprise of two sets of between 6 and 8 unique pieces.</p>

<h3><strong>Risks</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The campaign does not meet its goals</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Yeah this is a genuine concern given a) the time of year and b) the economic climate. It is a relatively small amount of funding required for the first miniature and there is a proven market for such product. That said though I think a weather eye will need to be kept on the campaign to pilot it to success.</p>
<p><strong>Increase in costs</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">At this stage the true cost for a caster has yet to be pinned down but I have used an average of market prices given to me by several other manufacturers and included a 20% contingency. As soon as I pin down the cost I will update the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Unexpected delays due to use of contractors</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Yes, certainly a risk given the nature of the beast. A strong communication plan and regular updates should help with this one. Any changes to delivery dates will be posted on the campaign as soon as they are confirmed.</p></div>","What are you asking for? What is it you are doing?
Simply put, I’m asking for $1,650 to bring a character from initial concept right though to the point where he can be put into production as a collector’s miniature. What follows is a rundown of the character, the line who I am and where we are as of 16-Nov-2012.

As an experienced traveller he has learned the hard way what he require on his journeys and carries everything on his person so as not to be a burden to his companions. A scholar more than a warrior he wears no armour but does carry a number of weapons including his large executioners blade. The sword, as much as a symbol of his office as his red coat, has a weight that moves along the blade with each swing lending each stroke fearsome power
The concept of the itinerant jurist is strongly based on the roaming Brehon judges of Irish history specifically between the 7th century when the orals laws of Ireland where written down for first time…
What is the Haar Miniature Line?
The Haar miniature line will contain heroes, villains, beasts and monsters from our Kharybdis Archipelago setting.  The theme of this world is Woodpunk i.e. Steampunk without the steam. It is a setting recovering from a significant war with many opportunities for those souls brave enough to seize them.  We have 36 concepts currently detailed in three series of 12 and artwork for the first series is already underway. Obviously this will take a number of years to get through just those we have planned at this stage.
All of the miniatures within the Haar line will be limited run with a number between 200 and 700 which will depend on the miniature and their associated costs. Once they are gone they are well… gone. I should emphasize that the final product is not just “a nice miniature” we’re aiming for a type of character pack including the miniature, base, concept art, setting cards, details about the characters back story etc… there will be a lot crammed into each one. We’re also currently looking into the legality of including pre-filled digital character sheets for popular RPGs, though this is currently outside the scope of the campaign.
The target markets for this line are global thanks to eCommerce. The miniatures themselves will be Heroic 28 to 30mm in scale and as such gamers will be able to use them in most games whether they are RPGs, board games or wargames.  I should also say that I am developing a board game within the same setting and players with any of the Haar miniatures can use them in the game, though they do not need to have them to enjoy it.

Who are you?
I’m Darren Barber a long time gamer based in Edinburgh Scotland. For the past 3 years I have been operating Pyre Studios, as a sole trader, a small online retail venture and painting service. I have made the difficult decision to shut down the retail part of the company and transition into the manufacture of my own products. Prior to this I spent 19 years as a project manager within the IT and telecoms sector for some well known multinationals.  
In terms of experience in the manufacture of miniatures and associated products I have none, zip …  nil. I do have close contacts with the manufactures whose products I stocked and they have been very generous with their advice and counsel. While this is a big step for me I feel that it is an informed one. I have already received feedback and constructive criticism on the ideas for this project and I really feel that it’s a go-er.
How the money will be spent
Below is a brief breakdown of where the funds will go. Effectively I’m looking to get to a position where the first miniature can be cast. I have a great imagination but no artistic flair (something that constantly frustrates me!) so I have to use far more talented contractors to realize my ideas. In order the money will be spent on;

$550: Concepts, art and packaging design
$700: Master miniature sculpt
$100: Resin master print (2)
$300: Mould creation (est)
Points 1 and 2 are hard costs i.e. I have been quoted, accepted and committed to them. Point 3 is for 2 master prints of the sculpt  and this is really a form of risk mitigation as things never go smoothly and my previous experience in retail gave me an insight into how often things get lost or damaged in the post. Point 4 is an estimate for the casting costs based on advice from other manufacturers and early quotes from casters

Current Status
As mentioned I have 36 character descriptions accompanied by my own rather “unique” stick figure art. rather than rest on my laurels I have done the following;
I have commissioned the character concept for Cambric together with character sketches for the ten characters and 2 monsters in  the first Haar series. The ludicrously talented Carlos Cara has done a phenomenal job in capturing the core of each character from sketch to final concept. As these are character studies they do not represent the final pose of the miniatures.
Olivier Nkweti, the sculptor for Cambric has done a fantastic job of bringing the miniatures character to life and completed the sculpt on the 14th of December. Olivier is grossly tallented and has previously worked for Rakham, Upperdeck, Privateerpress, Wryd, Infinity, CMON and Dark-Age to name just a few...
I have approached several other sculptors at the time of writing this to establish a schedule and wow, are they ever busy people? Two further sculptors have expressed an interest and given a rough schedule of when they are available. More details as they are confirmed
The process of identifying a casting company continues…
While all of this is ongoing I have been continuing to flesh out the setting, its cultures and history, I hope to begin commissioning pieces of setting art early in 2013.

What will you do if you exceed your funding target?
Well firstly let’s not jinx it! Secondly while this campaign will be specifically used for Cambric he is just the first in an ongoing line of miniatures. Any additional funds, after potential stretch goals, will be fed directly into that progamme.
The Kharybdis Archipelago setting lends itself to all forms of gaming so developing the context for the Haar line in conjunction with the miniatures seems like the right thing to do.


What will you do if you do not meet your funding target?
Honestly? All of the above but over a much longer timescale. I am committed to this range of products and its setting.
Stretch Goals: 
There are 12 miniatures sketched out for Haar Series 1. Being more realistic perhaps I've outlined the first three stretch goals beyond the funding for Cambric. Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves...

$3000: Haar 1-2: Sicilaine:The next character, Sicilaine: Lady of Waves and Rain, member of the 9 Mother Council, will be included in with the $15 & $22 perks. New sketches and concept art will be commissioned alongside the sculpt. A separate painted perk will be added for her ladyship: Estimated delivery February/March 2013

$4500: Haar 1-3: Tenril Mornen: The third character, Tenril Mornen: Seeker of the Aeryil and hero of Daur Fast. Tenril will be included in with the $15 & $22 perks. New sketches and concept art will be commissioned alongside the sculpt. A separate painted perk will be added for this world weary warrior.Estimated delivery February/March 2013

$5500: Genre Pack #1: Steampunk. This pack of 12 accessories with a steam punk feel will be added to the $22 & £40 perks. Comprising of ranged and melee weapons and odd looking pieces of equipment this pack will allow you to bring any of the Haar miniatures, or any others for that matter, into your steampunk themed games.Estimated delivery March 2013
we have other Genre Packs in the works such as high fantasy and arcane-tech or magi-tech. Each will comprise of two sets of between 6 and 8 unique pieces.

Risks
The campaign does not meet its goals
Yeah this is a genuine concern given a) the time of year and b) the economic climate. It is a relatively small amount of funding required for the first miniature and there is a proven market for such product. That said though I think a weather eye will need to be kept on the campaign to pilot it to success.
Increase in costs
At this stage the true cost for a caster has yet to be pinned down but I have used an average of market prices given to me by several other manufacturers and included a 20% contingency. As soon as I pin down the cost I will update the campaign.
Unexpected delays due to use of contractors
Yes, certainly a risk given the nature of the beast. A strong communication plan and regular updates should help with this one. Any changes to delivery dates will be posted on the campaign as soon as they are confirmed.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>1. What materiel it used to craft?  </strong></p>
<p>1.Only with 3Dsimo you can use different types of material as ABS (known as a material for LEGO bricks), PLA nature friendly material on the basis of starch, PVA which is soluble in water and last but not the least nylon. Material used is a 1.75mm this fiber.You can choose proper temperature and material speed, so you have more options what kind of material to use.</p>
<p><strong>2. What comes in Full Commercial Package?</strong></p>
<p>2. 3Dsimo full set includes 3Dsimo amazing pen, docking station, 30 meters of a printing material ABS also as PLA and a power supply unit. We are finalizing few more amazing extensions now. First two of them you will see in one week time!</p>
<p><strong>3.Where do we get that material once we ran out.</strong></p>
<p>3.We are going to offer you all mentioned types of material in all color options 20m each. If you have another needs, just let us know.</p>
<p><strong>4.Is it toxic, safe for kids to craft? I mean will it be hot while using or washable when used on skin,cloths?</strong></p>
<p>4.Materials as ABS,PLA,PVA or Nylon are not dangerous and toxic. You can find these materials in LEGO, foodstuffs or textile. The material is hot for a very limited time, we cannot recommend you to apply it on your body, but for example application on textile, glass or even paper is fine.</p>
<p><strong>5. Battery life of this device, can we have more information about it how it works actually?</strong></p>
<p>5.Our device doesn't have a battery as of now, we use a power supply unit. In the gallerz you can find a video previewing all the parametrs you can setup. 3Dsimo is based on the principle of FDM technology thus extruding plastic string through the hot end. You can choose a temperature which differs at each kind. It is only up to you how thick layer of the material you will decide to use, look at the LEGO brick from ABS. Once again thank you for your questions. Hope you to support our project.</p>

Then you have half won. You just need to make it real. This can be happened by using 3Dsimo which simply and fast enables you to draw 3D objects. And you don´t even need technical training. 3Dsimo has no limitations only user´s imagination and skillfulness. We have prepared for you set of models from various materials. 3Dsimo as a first on the world provides to user the possibility to choose print options on a digital display. The adjustability of temperature and speed of materials throughput now offer amazing opportunities for your creativity. We can handle various materials as ABS, PLA,PET,HIPS,FLEX black, PVA (water-soluble material), nylon at different temperatures in order to achieve fast filling or even print in the air. Other options include backlight, turn on preheating or memory for storing settings. These parameters are used to determine the appropriate method of drawing.Do not be limited by the choice of materials, for example choose between golden, silver, wooden or flexible PLA. Over time, new materials will be increasing due to the growing trend of 3D printing. Our 3Dsimo is fully prepared for this due to configurability of all parameters and thermal feedback for determining the exact temperature.How it works?3Dsimo is so simple to use as a pencil. Everyone who have ever draw with pencil will not have a problem to use 3Dsimo. After plugging it in you set the desired speed and temperature according to the material (these data will be appended together with 3Dsimo and new materials will be updated). 3Dsimo is based on the principle of FDM technology thus extruding plastic material through the hot end. If you want to print into the air or create infill of any object you can do it easily and quickly. There is no problem just make your choice. After a while of use you will find that with 3Dsimo you can create fantastic objects.3Dsimo has many utilization:
Repairing of plastic devices
Bonding and assembling models of 3D printers
Repair abortive print (due to repair you don’t need to enter new several hours lasting print)
Creating jewelry
To implement your ideas
Simply for the joy of modeling

battling it out against one another. 
Those who can’t inch past the crowds for optimal viewing will be amazed
by the detail they can see on the massive LED wall!  Yeah!  It’s ok.  You can read it again.  Massive LED wall!  It will be epic!  </p>
<p>We will also be hosting our version

Gaems.  Are you the best Halo player on the globe?  Got the skills to
prove it?  Players worldwide will be fighting their way to the top to win
over $10,000 in cash and prizes.  Cash and prizes will be awarded each day and the grand champion will be taking home at least $5,000 in cash! Why do we
say “at least”?  Each Halo 4 FFA pass purchased online will add $5 to the prize

About Game
The game is going to be a turn based strategy/board game where players(or AI) take turn re-drawing districts of a city to benefit their political party.
It features game modes with flexible and customizable gameplay parameters such as city size, number of districts, balance, population size and density.
There will also be a campaign with diverse scenarios.
Target platform is going to be Windows, Mac and Linux. 
Mobile/Tablet release is also a possibility, but not guaranteed.

The Impact
When the map maker has more power over the outcome of the election more than the voter, that means the system is unfair and this game is here to demonstrate that while providing meaningful and challenging gameplay.
Point of the game is to raise awareness of a vary real problem and start a conversation while also being a fun board/puzzle game.

Why I Need Funding  While game's framework is done, funding is needed for personal expenses while  working full-time on finishing the project. 
Depending on the funds raised i hope to hire an artist to help me with art asset production. Graphics and overall presentation of the game will depend on the funding.


    Risks & Challenges 

 Can you actually make the game?

The framework of the game has already been made, so there is not much risk of game not coming out if funded. And by framework i mean most of the game logic, game modes and interface layout. The game uses vary scalable semi-procedural level generation.


Can i play a demo?

Of course follow >>THIS LINK<< to a web demo introducing basic gameplay


Where will you publish it?

Right now im keeping an open mind and haven't decided definitely, but it's probably going to be self-published via web site or trough Steam.

Price?
Exact number is not decided yet, but it will be vary affordable.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there, I'm Conor Lazarou, computer science student and soon-to-be game developer with your help. I've been dreaming about making games since I got my first video game on my fifth birthday (Pokemon Red, in case you were wondering). Now that my nineteenth birthday is just around the corner, I realized I can actually start making games! There's nothing in my way!</p>
<p>Nothing in my way, that is, except software costs. I went online because I've been recommended to use GameMaker. Unfortunately, the modules I need for it cost $500. I don't have that kind of money, I'm a student!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So that's where you come in. I need $500 to buy my game design software so I can get to work at learning and churning out indie games. Anything over and above that $500 will go towards the games themselves, likely in buying music or other media rights.</p>
<p>My first game I've got planned is called Pip pip, a light-hearted puzzle game for tablet and smartphones.</p>
<p>Edit: Here's a rendition of what the game will look like:</p>
<p><img alt=""Mock-up of Pip pip"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s21.postimg.org/e4367fls7/Concept_2.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""pip pip rendition""/></p>
<p>After that, I'm thinking of making a more serious tactics/RPG game in the same genre as Nintendo's Fire Emblem games.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Any contribution you make would mean the world to me, and brings me a step closer to being able to call myself a game developer without my parents laughing at me and telling me to get a real job.</p>
<p>As for the perks, I've got a couple lined up.</p>
<p>For $10, you'll get a free copy of Pip pip once it's finished.</p>
<p>For $20, you and a friend, lover, mother, or cat get a free copy of Pip pip once it's finished.</p>
<p>For $50, you get two copies of Pip pip and your name in the special thanks section in the Pip pip credits</p>
<p>For $100, you get two copies of Pip pip, two copies of my tactics/RPG game upon its release, and your name in the special thanks section in both games</p>
<p>And for $500, if you're that generous, you get 5 copies of each game, and your name (or company name) in the credits in every commercial game I make EVER!</p>
<p>Keep in mind, though, that this is my first dip into game design and that I have no idea when the games will be finished. Christmas 2013 is a ballpark estimate for Pip pip, and Christmas 2014 for the tactics game.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you'd like to see me succeed but don't have the funds to contribute, you can still help out by</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing this campaign on your social media site of choice</li>
<li>Write a letter to your rich aunt Patty with the URL enclosed</li>
<li>Print off this page, tape it to a brick, and throw it through your local oil tycoon's window</li>

Hey there, I'm Conor Lazarou, computer science student and soon-to-be game developer with your help. I've been dreaming about making games since I got my first video game on my fifth birthday (Pokemon Red, in case you were wondering). Now that my nineteenth birthday is just around the corner, I realized I can actually start making games! There's nothing in my way!
Nothing in my way, that is, except software costs. I went online because I've been recommended to use GameMaker. Unfortunately, the modules I need for it cost $500. I don't have that kind of money, I'm a student!
What We Need & What You Get
So that's where you come in. I need $500 to buy my game design software so I can get to work at learning and churning out indie games. Anything over and above that $500 will go towards the games themselves, likely in buying music or other media rights.
My first game I've got planned is called Pip pip, a light-hearted puzzle game for tablet and smartphones.
Edit: Here's a rendition of what the game will look like:

After that, I'm thinking of making a more serious tactics/RPG game in the same genre as Nintendo's Fire Emblem games.


The Impact
Any contribution you make would mean the world to me, and brings me a step closer to being able to call myself a game developer without my parents laughing at me and telling me to get a real job.
As for the perks, I've got a couple lined up.
For $10, you'll get a free copy of Pip pip once it's finished.
For $20, you and a friend, lover, mother, or cat get a free copy of Pip pip once it's finished.
For $50, you get two copies of Pip pip and your name in the special thanks section in the Pip pip credits
For $100, you get two copies of Pip pip, two copies of my tactics/RPG game upon its release, and your name in the special thanks section in both games
And for $500, if you're that generous, you get 5 copies of each game, and your name (or company name) in the credits in every commercial game I make EVER!
Keep in mind, though, that this is my first dip into game design and that I have no idea when the games will be finished. Christmas 2013 is a ballpark estimate for Pip pip, and Christmas 2014 for the tactics game.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Story so far:</h3>
<p>The plane of Uurlathun is home to four deities. They created and rule over it from their thrones atop the spire, preferring to keep to themselves and allowing those below to flourish or fumble of their own accord. Allegiants serve their chosen deity, providing offerings and communing with them regularly. Peace has known the plane for decades since the banishment of Nephaestus to the continent of Alerion. But when the shadows loom over the mainland and those same deities go to war, the very fabric of reality will be torn asunder.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Who I am:</strong></h3>
<p>Greetings IndieGogo! I am Alex, a 23 year old Software Engineer. I've always been fascinated by video games, from the perspective of a player and a creator. I have been hard at work for the last year and a half learning and refining my game development skills. I've spent 6 months laying the groundwork for this project. As a solo developer I will be making the art, music and code myself, outsourcing only when absolutely necessary. I plan on tackling this project myself both as a way to cut my expenses, but also to get my hands on every aspect of the process so that I can move on to more ambitious projects in the future. If you'd like to contact me directly, or send more text than IndieGogo allows via the ""Ask a question"" button, please send me an email at: <u><strong><font color=""blue"">alexiworret@gmail.com</font></strong></u>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What the project is:</strong></h3>
<p>Greenfather's Gift is a 2d pixel art action-stealth game with a deep, recursive storyline and an emphasis on player choice and consequences. The game will be developed in Unity, though I will be making all assets from scratch so you won't have to worry about this being an asset flip. The story will shed light on some of Uurlathun's mysteries as well as hint at some for future projects. This game will focus on the interaction between The Aspect of the Sun (Ambra Sol) and The Aspect of the Earth (The Greenfather), with some meddling from the other deities as well. I will give out enough information to keep the setting and gameplay coherent, but not enough to answer all the questions the player might have. Some answers will need to be searched for in the world or deciphered from cryptic responses the deities themselves give to the player. The gameplay loop will focus heavily on avoidance rather than combat, though the option will always be available. Choices made in gameplay (aggression, avoidance, etc...) will gradually change how other characters see you and even how you see yourself (though the changes made are a secret for now). There will be branching narrative paths with dialogue options, some of which will be hidden, locked behind certain prerequisite actions. I plan to have background music specific to each major character as well as musical cues when they speak. For example the Greenfather would have a woodwind background song and deep string section sounds for his voice.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why the project is:</strong></h3>
<p>I see this project as the first step on our journey to create a vast interwoven narrative that spans multiple games and styles. The world I've created is large and rife with potential. I can think of no less than 4 completely unique gameplay styles that would fit perfectly and still maintain a connected narrative, ranging from a clicker style game to a fullblown RPG. That's before I receive any ideas from the community. I would love to completely flesh out all aspects of this universe. More than anything, I want to create a community that enjoys and heavily impacts the content created. Backing this project or joining the community will not only facilitate it's completion, but also pave the road for the journey ahead.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Where the project is: </strong></h3>
<p>The world of Uurlathun was designed to be as much a character as the NPCs and player themselves. The fictitious universe the game is set in is one I have been working on for over four years. It features extensive world building lore and many over-arching plot twists and threads that I believe most people will not see coming. Creatures and plants, along with the races that inhabit the world, are simultaneously familiar and yet foreign. That being said, many of those elements are above the scope of this individual entry in what I hope to be a large series.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How/When the project is:</strong></h3>
<p>So far I've been steadily implementing features and working on the art and music for the game. Currently I would say it is between 10-15% complete. Estimating total time for completion based on the first six months and the fact that things should speed up gradually as I grow more familiar with the systems I'm creating, I am confident that I can deliver a finished product within 1.5-2 years. A good portion of the background systems have been at minimum first passed, with some being very near to completion.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cutscene system (Needs improvement, but basic functionality is there and expandable)</li>
<li>Day/Night and miscellaneous lighting (first pass)</li>
<li>Passive/Wildlife creature AI (first pass)</li>
<li>Skill unlock system</li>
<li>Grimoire system (Needs art update and more features but mostly done)</li>
<li>Main menu -- The main menu will be part of the game itself, not just boxes you can click. I've completed a rough draft with placeholder art currently, but the logic and flow is good.</li>
<li>General Player movement (in a good spot right now, but might update as game matures)</li>
<li>Player ""morality"" system (First Pass) -- I wish to keep the actual stat a secret as it has story implications</li>
<li>Hud-less gameplay -- I plan to provide the player with information via character interactions rather than a HUD. For example, the player character's eyes will glow red in shadow so you can keep track and easily determine if you are hidden, while they will glow blue if you are within range to initiate an attack.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why I need your support:</h3>
<p>I have been refining and building this world for 4+ years, and am only now in a position where I can truly invest myself into its creation full time. My expenses and external commitments are minimal right now, as I quit my IT job about a year ago after saving up to pursue this project. This is the time for me to go all in, but I can't do it alone. With your help I believe that we can create a universe that people will revisit for years to come.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Incentives:</strong></h3>
<p>Once I am ready to release the game I plan on selling it for between 10-15 dollars depending on how many additional features I can add during the development timeframe. I realize that investing in a new developer is a risk, as such all backers at or above the $5 tier will receive at least one copy of the game.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Support?</h3>
<p>I believe that I can create a one of a kind story and that it will lead into many more down the line. I created the world of Uurlathun to be expandable as well as moldable, modular in a way. However, I can't possibly create all the stories that this world can offer alone. Together I believe we can make a universe that people will want to keep re-visiting over and over. You won't just be supporting this single game, you'll be joining a community that will create an unforgettable universe.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Full disclosure:</h3>
<p>I have a Bachelors in Software Engineering, and some professional programming experience. While I don't have professional game development experience, I've known that this was my calling for as long as I can remember and have been slowly learning and engaging with the medium for over a decade. I know what makes a good game and I'm determined to have mine make the cut. I won't say that learning Unity for the first time was easy, but I'm at a position now where I am confident and excited to see where I can take this project. I've run into my fair share of hurdles, but there hasn't been a single problem I was unable to solve.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Complications:</h3>
<p>Time is the largest hurdle as a solo developer. However, I am committed to delivering a finished, high quality product within the 2 year time frame. While I would prefer to work alone for the entire project, if something is taking too long for me to do on my own I am open to working with external artists and programmers.</p>

<p>Can't afford to back the project or don't feel comfortable doing so? No worries! I don't currently use social media, but you can contact me via my campaign email if you have questions or concerns. Also, please spread the word about this project if it interests you or you think it might interest a friend or family member. Word of mouth is incredibly powerful and even a small remark in passing can make a difference. Feel free to directly link people to the campaign if you'd like. That's all from me for now, thank you for your time!</p>

Time is the largest hurdle as a solo developer. However, I am committed to delivering a finished, high quality product within the 2 year time frame. While I would prefer to work alone for the entire project, if something is taking too long for me to do on my own I am open to working with external artists and programmers.
 

Non-monetary Contributions:
 
Can't afford to back the project or don't feel comfortable doing so? No worries! I don't currently use social media, but you can contact me via my campaign email if you have questions or concerns. Also, please spread the word about this project if it interests you or you think it might interest a friend or family member. Word of mouth is incredibly powerful and even a small remark in passing can make a difference. Feel free to directly link people to the campaign if you'd like. That's all from me for now, thank you for your time!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Varkalai: The Cradle Of Fate is not only the first chapter of an adventure that will undoubtedly captivate you from beginning to end, it also represents Dekreed's first major project, an initiative aimed at reliving the golden age of video games, combining the spirit of yesterday with the technologies of tomorrow.</p>
<p>We have worked very hard to get to this point and, to confess, we are filled with the excitement of finally being able to present our advances to you, those crazy ideas that little by little went from paper to movement, becoming a whole symphony of captivating characters and pulsating worlds.</p>
<p>Varkalai's story arc combines the most controversial aspects of modern science and pseudoscience, tackling such interesting topics as parallel universes, chaos and entropy, big bang theory, big crunch and big freeze, Einstein-Rosen holes and ooparts, in addition to hundreds of winks in homage to great works of science fiction, such as Carl Sagan's Contact.</p>
<p>We want to thank you in advance if you decide to support us to reach the goal, but we will also understand if it escapes your possibilities. We have no doubt that, if you really like what we are doing, you will find a way to boost us.</p>

<p>After the end, and before creation, there is a period and a special plane of existence in which the rules that will govern the universe are written.<br/><br/>Seen from the outside, just a spark in the dark. From within, the ultimate expression of a troubled mind. The roar of a hypergiant machinery that with great agility and maximum experience, tears the membranes of time, mixing past with future until obtaining its quintessence.<br/><br/>This primal form will rest for eons in the middle of nowhere, until the chaotic flow of so many memories turns into thought, and this, in turn, into full and absolute intellect.<br/><br/>Once aware of its own existence, its violent awakening will start the new expansion, releasing in it the 12 Foundations. The immaterial will become tangible and time will pass once more.<br/><br/>This is how the first universe was born, this is how the others was born, this is how all these must be born and reborn forever, or else the stars would lose their heat and end up fading into eternal darkness.<br/><br/>This recurring process is known as Magna Sileo. The missing piece in the puzzle of creation, then, only the witnesses of time before time know of its existence and understand its infinite complexity.</p>
<p><strong>It will be in the middle of this process that the greatest conflict will take place.</strong></p>
<p>Astramos was the first and only conscious being to be created during the spontaneous expansion of the first universe, the one who, after having been subjected to the most absolute solitude for eons, ended up deciphering the relationship between the Habbaén and the Ghaiath (material and immaterial planes), thus allowing him to change state at will.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621798764/ypqemzvio4yad3w46kly.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Possessor of an ancestral intellect, Astramos sees himself as the empirical perfection of consciousness, an absolute being that is unparalleled, the rightful owner of time and space, so he is not willing to share any universe with other sentient beings, considering them crude copies, inferior, redundant and unworthy of existing.</p>
<p>To satisfy his desire for a Pure Existence, Astramos created Baloram, an empty and insensitive being, whose sole purpose is to exterminate all sentient beings beyond his creator. This, in turn, served as the basis for consolidating the fiercest and most implacable army, the Nkiross.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621798849/bscfczchknzvfw7qwin3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Despite Baloram's efforts, the spread of sentient beings increased exponentially with each expansion, so Astramos made the decision to not allow the development of another Magna Sileo. This action implies the death of the universe and, in fact, the very disappearance of Astramos, but also represents his opportunity to experience the only event that has remained beyond his understanding.</p>

<p>Varkalai is an action / adventure, open world, single player, third person video game whose deep narrative and dynamic gameplay guarantee a highly immersive interactive experience.</p>
<p>The player assumes the role of Korioss, a child created by the Conscious Star Aldeghan and heir to all his knowledge, so that he finds a way to stop Astramos in his quest for the irreversible extinction of the universes.</p>
<p>Korioss is just a child, but he must gather all his courage and determination to defend and restore hope to The Chosen, those who were trapped in the vestiges of time and whose experiences will serve as the seed to shape the new universe.</p>
<p>To fulfill his purpose, Korioss must find Varkalai, a legendary warrior from the Second Cycle, who was imprisoned of his own free will because he was unable to control his infinite anger and thirst for destruction.</p>

<p>Korioss makes use of his Chakram, which is impregnated with Varkalai's soul, being able to invoke it at will during the battle as a special ability, however, its excessive use can lead to Varkalai revealing himself and attacking Korioss or any of his companions.</p>

</div></div>","Varkalai: The Cradle Of Fate is not only the first chapter of an adventure that will undoubtedly captivate you from beginning to end, it also represents Dekreed's first major project, an initiative aimed at reliving the golden age of video games, combining the spirit of yesterday with the technologies of tomorrow.
We have worked very hard to get to this point and, to confess, we are filled with the excitement of finally being able to present our advances to you, those crazy ideas that little by little went from paper to movement, becoming a whole symphony of captivating characters and pulsating worlds.
Varkalai's story arc combines the most controversial aspects of modern science and pseudoscience, tackling such interesting topics as parallel universes, chaos and entropy, big bang theory, big crunch and big freeze, Einstein-Rosen holes and ooparts, in addition to hundreds of winks in homage to great works of science fiction, such as Carl Sagan's Contact.
We want to thank you in advance if you decide to support us to reach the goal, but we will also understand if it escapes your possibilities. We have no doubt that, if you really like what we are doing, you will find a way to boost us.
Let's start then, we have a great story to tell and you have a great story to live!
 

After the end, and before creation, there is a period and a special plane of existence in which the rules that will govern the universe are written.Seen from the outside, just a spark in the dark. From within, the ultimate expression of a troubled mind. The roar of a hypergiant machinery that with great agility and maximum experience, tears the membranes of time, mixing past with future until obtaining its quintessence.This primal form will rest for eons in the middle of nowhere, until the chaotic flow of so many memories turns into thought, and this, in turn, into full and absolute intellect.Once aware of its own existence, its violent awakening will start the new expansion, releasing in it the 12 Foundations. The immaterial will become tangible and time will pass once more.This is how the first universe was born, this is how the others was born, this is how all these must be born and reborn forever, or else the stars would lose their heat and end up fading into eternal darkness.This recurring process is known as Magna Sileo. The missing piece in the puzzle of creation, then, only the witnesses of time before time know of its existence and understand its infinite complexity.
It will be in the middle of this process that the greatest conflict will take place.
Astramos was the first and only conscious being to be created during the spontaneous expansion of the first universe, the one who, after having been subjected to the most absolute solitude for eons, ended up deciphering the relationship between the Habbaén and the Ghaiath (material and immaterial planes), thus allowing him to change state at will.

Possessor of an ancestral intellect, Astramos sees himself as the empirical perfection of consciousness, an absolute being that is unparalleled, the rightful owner of time and space, so he is not willing to share any universe with other sentient beings, considering them crude copies, inferior, redundant and unworthy of existing.
To satisfy his desire for a Pure Existence, Astramos created Baloram, an empty and insensitive being, whose sole purpose is to exterminate all sentient beings beyond his creator. This, in turn, served as the basis for consolidating the fiercest and most implacable army, the Nkiross.

Despite Baloram's efforts, the spread of sentient beings increased exponentially with each expansion, so Astramos made the decision to not allow the development of another Magna Sileo. This action implies the death of the universe and, in fact, the very disappearance of Astramos, but also represents his opportunity to experience the only event that has remained beyond his understanding.
 

Varkalai is an action / adventure, open world, single player, third person video game whose deep narrative and dynamic gameplay guarantee a highly immersive interactive experience.
The player assumes the role of Korioss, a child created by the Conscious Star Aldeghan and heir to all his knowledge, so that he finds a way to stop Astramos in his quest for the irreversible extinction of the universes.
Korioss is just a child, but he must gather all his courage and determination to defend and restore hope to The Chosen, those who were trapped in the vestiges of time and whose experiences will serve as the seed to shape the new universe.
To fulfill his purpose, Korioss must find Varkalai, a legendary warrior from the Second Cycle, who was imprisoned of his own free will because he was unable to control his infinite anger and thirst for destruction.

The work is divided into 3 chapters; The Cradle Of Fate, Wrath Of The Forsaken, and The Overtime Addendum, each being an independent video game.
 

Korioss makes use of his Chakram, which is impregnated with Varkalai's soul, being able to invoke it at will during the battle as a special ability, however, its excessive use can lead to Varkalai revealing himself and attacking Korioss or any of his companions.

Having been appointed Cleric of House Aparctias (The North Tower) by Aldeghan, he is regularly accompanied by his friends; Gashin of House Notos, Zeghay of House Apeliotes and Nassae of House Zephyrus; South, East and West Towers respectively.
Both Korioss and his companions have a set of abilities and skills, according to the House they represent:
 

House Aparctias studies the mysteries of the mind. Korioss is capable of manipulating his environment just by thinking about it. He can influence his Chakram and possess friendly units.
 

House Notos studies the mysteries of life. Gashin is capable of manipulating the natural resources around him. He can also manipulate both friendly and enemy beasts.
 

House Apeliotes studies the mysteries of death. Zeghay is capable of inflicting great pain on his enemies. He can also accelerate the deterioration of various elements of his environment at will.
 

House Zephyrus studies the mysteries of energy. Nassae is capable of absorbing, manipulating, and transmuting any form of energy in the universe. He can also unleash devastating AoE attacks.
 
To progress in the adventure, the player must give instructions to his companions or possess them directly, both for combat, and to overcome the obstacles that he finds in his way.

The game consists of finding and destroying the Arjadi Garhejath (Obelisks of Torment) located by the army of Astramos in each of the 12 Limits. Powerful and heavily guarded artifacts, intended to distort the memory of The Chosen, sentient beings, whose memories and experiences will serve as a point of reference for the creation of the new universe.
As long as the Arjadi are standing, the Magna Sileo cannot be completed.
Following the destruction of an Arjadi and the extermination of the invading forces in a Limit, Korioss can create and deploy various defense systems to prevent its recapture.
Some Limits can be liberated by brute force, others should be captured by infiltration and sabotage.
The 12 Limits are majestic habitats located at the center of each of the edges of the universe in Magna Sileo. They are manifestations caused by the massive fusion of memories and experiences of The Chosen, who remain in these until the moment of the new expansion.
 
The development of the first chapter of Varkalai, “The Cradle Of Fate” began to take place in March 2020 and has been progressing at a good pace despite the difficulties inherent to the time in which we live. Currently the game engine, along with its gameplay, are completed, leaving only the artistic work that will complement the narrative arc.

<p style="""">With the rule engine we've built, the system can be increased or decreased in complexity, allowing us to build three different versions of the game, all using the same core rules. This means that young kids, ages 4-7 can play the game (with parental assistance and supervision) and learn to recognize numbers, do basic math, and begin to establish and hone critical thinking and imaginative problem solving skills. We call this the 'Grow With Me RPG' system.</p>

<p style="""">For kids ages 7-13, we add in another layer of logistics, giving them more attributes, more bonuses, and more granular control over their character's progression and advancement. But we still keep the game quick and easy by not bogging them down with the minutia of character generation, tracking experience, leveling up, etc. Character progression is tracked more like a video game with advancement handled by upgrading equipment.</p>
<p style="""">For older kids and adults alike, the full version of the game is a robust and feature-rich system that allows for full character development, more bonuses, skill progression and acquisition, and more. </p>

<p style="""">The Kalijor RPG is built on its own, built from the ground up, game engine that allows groups to play with or without dice, depending upon the style of play you and your group prefer. If you choose to play without dice, then the skill ranking system allows the group to decide success or failure of actions and combat, and if you choose to play with dice, then the game will support you with a robust and comprehensive system that will meet your needs.</p>
<p style="""">Combat rolls are made on 2D10, which serves to normalize results and increase the relevance and importance of skills and attributes. A side benefit of this is to make critical success and failure a much more rare occurrence (1 in 56 odds). </p>
<p style="""">The skill ranking system allows for both contested skill rolls and rolls against target difficulties based upon the complexity of the task and situation.</p>

At its core, the setting is science fiction, about a thousand years in humanity’s future. In the span between today and the setting of the books, corporations have taken over the governance of the human race, using a nuclear conflict on Earth as the final and clinching proof that traditional governments were not up to the task at hand.</p>
<p style=""font: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px currentColor; vertical-align: baseline;"">Since they took over, Humanity has spread out across the solar system and both Genetic Engineering and Cybernetic technology have become commonplace. There are mining and fabrication operations spread across the planets and their moons and everyone has what they need to survive.

<p style=""font: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px currentColor; vertical-align: baseline;"">Beneath the shiny veneer of Conglomerate rule, there is a thriving, hidden world where the Dissidents and their undocumented settlements refine raw materials, fabricate goods and smuggle things in and out of Conglomerate facilities, all without official sanction, but still at the behest of the Conglomerate themselves. Of course, since these Dissidents are are not citizens, they cannot be officially allowed to transport cargo, or enter Conglomerate territory, which means that they are subject to open harrassment from Conglomerate forces, up to and including the forfeiture of cargo, and even their vessels and equipment.</p>
<p style=""font: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 0px; border: 0px currentColor; vertical-align: baseline;"">That said, one of the things the Conglomerate does provide, is recreation. And one of those forms of recreation is a massively multi-player online game called Kalijor. This is a fully-immersive high fantasy themed virtual reality game that people log into and inhabit avatars, sort of like in the Matrix films. This game allows people to become someone else for a while to get away from things and have some adventures, all from the safety of their own homes.</p>

<h2><strong>Challenges this project may face:</strong></h2>
<p>At this point our worst enemy is time. Play-testing is proceeding well and feedback continues to be excellent so we are on track to release the games at GenCon Indy 2013.</p>
<p>The schedule has been padded a bit to allow for complications and the possibility of the unforeseeable is always there. Best efforts have been made to make sure that these issues do not impact the production timetable and we have a dedicated team of people that all know the plan and have access to everything.</p>
<p>All four artists have committed themselves to the project, the bulk of the writing is done (except for introductions, prefaces, and some other little, non-mechanical blurbs), and we are just working on making as many refinements as we can via play-testing before publication.</p>
<p>In short, the game, in all of its iterations, is all but finished. All we need is art, some layout, and a few little touch-ups.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Wasnt this program just over on one of those other crowdfunding sites asking for more money? What gives?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes it was. The initial ask on that other site was for $8,000 which included everything I am asking for here except copies for GenCon and art for the Kalijor: Kids RPG. As an alternative to the whole amount asked for there, I've scaled things back a bit and will fund the art for the Kalijor: Kids RPG book and what copies I can afford out of the business' existing funds. This route means potentially fewer copies at launch, but with your help the amount and quality of the art will still be where we want it to be. Also, the funding model on this site means that I can get the artists to work right away, which helps the project stay on track for its August release at GenCon 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> In what way are you, Paul, qualified to write and publish a Role Playing Game?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Good question. I've been playing RPGs and writing stories most of my life (for the better part of 35 years). I've played many systems and am usually the GM/DM/Story Teller, so I have a fondness for learning the mechanics of the game and a pretty intimate knowledge of which parts work, and which part's don't.</p>
<p>As with anyone who has written a new RPG, I took the mechanics that I liked from dozens of systems, worked very hard at streamlining the new engine, and have solicited as many and varied opinions from long-time gamers as I can. I have engaged numerous groups to play-test the system and have been very rigorous about taking their feedback, making changes and getting new updates out.</p>
<p>The game has been in testing for years, and in its current state for almost 24 months with most changes being primarily tweaks to small pieces of the system. We still have a couple minor things to tweak, but that is almost entirely playing with verbiage and adding some skills to beef up character diversity.</p>
<p>Mechanically, I feel the book and the game engine are in very good shape and ready for prime time. That said, I have been publishing books since 2007 and I now feel that my understanding of the process, mechanics, and industry is at last up to the task of getting this game to market.</p>
<p>It isn't a walk in the park, to be sure, but I have made a lot of contacts, and built up an incredible support structure around my operation to make sure that important tasks/details do not get dropped. The turn-around time on publishing new books is months shorter than when I began, and the quality of published material has increased exponentially. I have four amazing artists willing to chip in on the project and the Grow With Me system is needed in the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> So, you've written a new RPG. Is it one shot and done? Or is there more support planned?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> So glad you asked! This is by no means a one-shot deal. I have plans to write dozens of sourcebooks to add to and enrich the world of the Kalijor RPG. In fact, I already have a dozen of them in various stages of completion. Two of them are nearly finished and require only a little more work, and some art, to get them to you!</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Okay, so you're planning sourcebooks. What will they look like?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> In the beginning, each sourcebook will center on a major population center in the future, or in Kalijor, and provide some details of the surrounding area(s). At present, the plan is to release one book for the future, then one for Kalijor, then repeat the cycle until all of the major cities/locations are covered. After that, we'll see what happens, but there are plenty of places to detail before that is a thought we'll need to entertain.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Will there be multiple versions of each sourcebook? One for each age range main book (Kalijor RPG, Kalijor: Kids RPG)?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> At present, the plan is to publish only one version of each sourcebook. The beauty of the Kalijor RPG engine is that the mechanics are easily adjustable to accommodate each version of the game. Rather than publishing multiple versions of the book, we'll include a brief blurb at the front of each to explain how to make adjustments to play with each version of the rules. In most cases, this means simply disregarding certain logistics.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What will happen to any additional funds contributed beyond the primary goal?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Additional funds will result in more art in the books, and more copies on hand at GenCon 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What happens if the funding goal isn't reached?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We will fund the books through alternate revenue streams. The books will still get published, and we'll still be at GenCon, but there will be much less art in them (and I'll have to slow down the timetable on sourcebook production because more of the profits from sales will have to go toward paying down the debt incurred to finish publication).</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How many copies will be at GenCon?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The $3,000 goal allows for the payment of the artists for a basic amount of interior art, the cover art, the cost of publication and copyrighting. Without additional funding the number of copies at GenCon will be limited to what I can afford using any additional contributions beyond the $3,000 goal, plus whatever I can afford to chip in from the business' existing budget.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When you say more money means more art and more copies, what does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> After the initial goal is met, every additional $100 means 1-3 interior images (depending upon size), and 1-2 additional copies. There is, however, a maximum art threshold and, while we aren't sure where that is just yet, once we reach it, all additional funds will go toward copies, then the first sourcebook once we feel we have enough copies to handle initial sales demand.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Have you accounted for Indigogo fees and rewards/shipping costs in your calculations?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! The $3,000 funding goal includes our actual minimum needs plus another 10%. The extra is to account for the Indigogo fees, and a little bit more to cover rewards and shipping. We aren't passing all of the costs on to you, my generous supporters, but we are asking you to assist us with them.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Doesn't Indigogo charge 4% if you successfully fund? Wht's with the 10% you mention above?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> You are correct. The math was done a t 10% to allow for the possability that we don't get fully funded and end up paying the higher 9% Indigogo fee. When we ~do~ get fully funded, that extra percentage goes right back into art and copies.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What's up with the terrible lip-syncing going on in your video?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This is merely illustrative of why I have chosen to be a writer, rather than a videographer. In truth, I have no idea what caused that issue. It just rendered that way when I pushed the button...</p>

The Kalijor Role Playing Game project is intended to not only bring the world of Kalijor home to your gaming table, but to help you introduce the concept of pen and paper role playing games to the next generation of gamers.
With the rule engine we've built, the system can be increased or decreased in complexity, allowing us to build three different versions of the game, all using the same core rules. This means that young kids, ages 4-7 can play the game (with parental assistance and supervision) and learn to recognize numbers, do basic math, and begin to establish and hone critical thinking and imaginative problem solving skills. We call this the 'Grow With Me RPG' system.

Genetic engineering is commonplace in the future.
For kids ages 7-13, we add in another layer of logistics, giving them more attributes, more bonuses, and more granular control over their character's progression and advancement. But we still keep the game quick and easy by not bogging them down with the minutia of character generation, tracking experience, leveling up, etc. Character progression is tracked more like a video game with advancement handled by upgrading equipment.
For older kids and adults alike, the full version of the game is a robust and feature-rich system that allows for full character development, more bonuses, skill progression and acquisition, and more. 

The Rathalon portal chamber in the virtual world of Kalijor.

The Kalijor RPG is built on its own, built from the ground up, game engine that allows groups to play with or without dice, depending upon the style of play you and your group prefer. If you choose to play without dice, then the skill ranking system allows the group to decide success or failure of actions and combat, and if you choose to play with dice, then the game will support you with a robust and comprehensive system that will meet your needs.
Combat rolls are made on 2D10, which serves to normalize results and increase the relevance and importance of skills and attributes. A side benefit of this is to make critical success and failure a much more rare occurrence (1 in 56 odds). 
The skill ranking system allows for both contested skill rolls and rolls against target difficulties based upon the complexity of the task and situation.

 About the world of Kalijor
The human race has moved out among the planets to escape a devastated Earth. Massive corporations control every aspect of life. While nobody who is willing to play by the rules will go hungry, or without a home, there are those who strive to take back their independence from the corporate Conglomerate. Their battles to determine the fate of the human race take place in the real world, in cyber-space, and in the virtual world of Kalijor, a massively multiplayer online RPG that has become a hub of commerce and communication for a humanity spread out across the stars.
 
More details:


The world of Kalijor is sort of three worlds in one, and the game system reflects that, and captures it very well. At its core, the setting is science fiction, about a thousand years in humanity’s future. In the span between today and the setting of the books, corporations have taken over the governance of the human race, using a nuclear conflict on Earth as the final and clinching proof that traditional governments were not up to the task at hand.
Since they took over, Humanity has spread out across the solar system and both Genetic Engineering and Cybernetic technology have become commonplace. There are mining and fabrication operations spread across the planets and their moons and everyone has what they need to survive. Jobs, food, education, even entertainment, all provided by the Conglomerate, which is comprised of the heads of the five largest corporations in the solar system.
Of course, not everyone is happy with this corporate dictatorship and there those who live on the fringe, outside society and off the grid. These people are called Dissidents and have become legal non-entities in the eyes of the Conglomerate. But, everything has a price, and sometimes it just makes good business sense to insure the viability of a competitor...
Beneath the shiny veneer of Conglomerate rule, there is a thriving, hidden world where the Dissidents and their undocumented settlements refine raw materials, fabricate goods and smuggle things in and out of Conglomerate facilities, all without official sanction, but still at the behest of the Conglomerate themselves. Of course, since these Dissidents are are not citizens, they cannot be officially allowed to transport cargo, or enter Conglomerate territory, which means that they are subject to open harrassment from Conglomerate forces, up to and including the forfeiture of cargo, and even their vessels and equipment.

We still have a couple minor things to tweak, but that is almost entirely playing with verbiage and adding some skills to beef up character diversity.
Mechanically, I feel the book and the game engine are in very good shape and ready for prime time. That said, I have been publishing books since 2007 and I now feel that my understanding of the process, mechanics, and industry is at last up to the task of getting this game to market.
It isn't a walk in the park, to be sure, but I have made a lot of contacts, and built up an incredible support structure around my operation to make sure that important tasks/details do not get dropped. The turn-around time on publishing new books is months shorter than when I began, and the quality of published material has increased exponentially. I have four amazing artists willing to chip in on the project and the Grow With Me system is needed in the industry.
Q: So, you've written a new RPG. Is it one shot and done? Or is there more support planned?
A: So glad you asked! This is by no means a one-shot deal. I have plans to write dozens of sourcebooks to add to and enrich the world of the Kalijor RPG. In fact, I already have a dozen of them in various stages of completion. Two of them are nearly finished and require only a little more work, and some art, to get them to you!
Q: Okay, so you're planning sourcebooks. What will they look like?
A: In the beginning, each sourcebook will center on a major population center in the future, or in Kalijor, and provide some details of the surrounding area(s). At present, the plan is to release one book for the future, then one for Kalijor, then repeat the cycle until all of the major cities/locations are covered. After that, we'll see what happens, but there are plenty of places to detail before that is a thought we'll need to entertain.
Q: Will there be multiple versions of each sourcebook? One for each age range main book (Kalijor RPG, Kalijor: Kids RPG)?
A: At present, the plan is to publish only one version of each sourcebook. The beauty of the Kalijor RPG engine is that the mechanics are easily adjustable to accommodate each version of the game. Rather than publishing multiple versions of the book, we'll include a brief blurb at the front of each to explain how to make adjustments to play with each version of the rules. In most cases, this means simply disregarding certain logistics.
Q: What will happen to any additional funds contributed beyond the primary goal?
A: Additional funds will result in more art in the books, and more copies on hand at GenCon 2013.
Q: What happens if the funding goal isn't reached?
A: We will fund the books through alternate revenue streams. The books will still get published, and we'll still be at GenCon, but there will be much less art in them (and I'll have to slow down the timetable on sourcebook production because more of the profits from sales will have to go toward paying down the debt incurred to finish publication).
Q: How many copies will be at GenCon?
A: The $3,000 goal allows for the payment of the artists for a basic amount of interior art, the cover art, the cost of publication and copyrighting. Without additional funding the number of copies at GenCon will be limited to what I can afford using any additional contributions beyond the $3,000 goal, plus whatever I can afford to chip in from the business' existing budget.
Q: When you say more money means more art and more copies, what does that mean?
A: After the initial goal is met, every additional $100 means 1-3 interior images (depending upon size), and 1-2 additional copies. There is, however, a maximum art threshold and, while we aren't sure where that is just yet, once we reach it, all additional funds will go toward copies, then the first sourcebook once we feel we have enough copies to handle initial sales demand.
Q: Have you accounted for Indigogo fees and rewards/shipping costs in your calculations?
A: Yes! The $3,000 funding goal includes our actual minimum needs plus another 10%. The extra is to account for the Indigogo fees, and a little bit more to cover rewards and shipping. We aren't passing all of the costs on to you, my generous supporters, but we are asking you to assist us with them.
Q: Doesn't Indigogo charge 4% if you successfully fund? Wht's with the 10% you mention above?
A: You are correct. The math was done a t 10% to allow for the possability that we don't get fully funded and end up paying the higher 9% Indigogo fee. When we ~do~ get fully funded, that extra percentage goes right back into art and copies.
Q: What's up with the terrible lip-syncing going on in your video?
A: This is merely illustrative of why I have chosen to be a writer, rather than a videographer. In truth, I have no idea what caused that issue. It just rendered that way when I pushed the button...",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Meiko Miniatures is a small company producing miniatures for Fantasy

players with a wide variety of miniatures to help them complete their teams. To
achieve this we always work with the most talented sculptors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">You can see here our previous 5 Meiko Indiegogo campaigns:

<p></p>
<p><b>Why crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Meiko <span>Miniatures new project is the <b>Ultimate Kaos Team</b>. The Kaos Team
will include the following Players: 4 Kaos Warriors, 8 Beastmen with no Mutation, 4 Mutated Beastmen (Two
Heads, Extra Arm, Claws and Big Hand), 3 Minotaurs (standard, mutated and Star
Player) and 4 Kaos Demons (War, Mutation, Rotten and Pleasure), that you may
use if you wish as alternative Beastmen. The campaign will also include 3 new Star
Players (Leader, Chainsaw and Tentacle) that can play with the Kaos Team, three
Mutation Sprues (one for miniatures of standard size, a second one for
miniatures with “Strength 4” size and a third one for Big Guys) and several
more items: two Kaos Pitches (Puzzle-like Hard Pitch and Rollable Plastic
Gaming Pitch), Kaos and </span><span>Mutated
Football,</span> racial Range
Ruler, a Kaos Cheerleader, a Kaos Flipping Coin, a Demon Apotehcary, a Set of 2
Kaos Dice, 1d6 Injury Dice and a Jumbo 1d8 Serious Injury Dice.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The sculpting of most of these miniatures has already
been made. But we need your help to speed up the casting process. That way, we
will be able to release the Meiko Kaos Team much sooner than what was initially
planned. Using Indiegogo as a platform to rise funds helps us a lot since we
can finance new miniatures and other interesting items, obtain feedback from
our customers and it gives us confidence to keep working on. In exchange
you will get some cool rewards.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All the miniatures will be casted in metal. The master
moulds will be made by Miniaturas Alemany, the mouldmaker of other successful
Fantasy Football Indiegogo campaigns like the Willy Goblin Team and the Willy
Amazon Team. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The sculptor of all the miniatures of this team is Franarcilla</b>, the skilled
sculptor of many other Meiko teams like the Kaos Dwarf, Undead, Necromantic,
Ogre, Goblin, Rotter, Orc and Wood Elf Teams, just to mention some of them.
Franarcilla is one of Meiko Miniatures flagship sculptors. His dark sculpting
style specially fits with all the chaotic races, and his Kaos minis will fit
with the image we all have in mind when we think about this team. Currently,
Franarcilla is considered by many Fantasy Football fans as one of the best and
most talented Fantasy Football sculptors worldwide. </p>

If you are
a real Kaos Coach… pick up your Level! It’s now or never.
Important: all the backers of this campaign that pledged
for any Team before October 30th (30/10/15) will be able to exchange
the Team if they wish. Please contact us at meikominiatures@gmail.com
and let us know which Level you pledged for and the which Level you wish.About us
Meiko Miniatures is a small company producing miniatures for Fantasy
Football. We offer alternative designs to the ones existing and we provide the
players with a wide variety of miniatures to help them complete their teams. To
achieve this we always work with the most talented sculptors.
You can see here our previous 5 Meiko Indiegogo campaigns:
Lizardmen, Kaos Dwarves, Ratmen, Undead / Necromantic and Kaos Pact. All the packages of these five campaigns
were shipped just 3 months after the end of each campaign, accomplishing
the estimated shipping dates stated on the campaign descriptions:

https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-s-undead-necromantic-fantasy-football-team
https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kaos-pact-fantasy-football-team-meiko-miniatures#/story

Why crowdfunding?
The Meiko Miniatures new project is the Ultimate Kaos Team. The Kaos Team
will include the following Players: 4 Kaos Warriors, 8 Beastmen with no Mutation, 4 Mutated Beastmen (Two
Heads, Extra Arm, Claws and Big Hand), 3 Minotaurs (standard, mutated and Star
Player) and 4 Kaos Demons (War, Mutation, Rotten and Pleasure), that you may
use if you wish as alternative Beastmen. The campaign will also include 3 new Star
Players (Leader, Chainsaw and Tentacle) that can play with the Kaos Team, three
Mutation Sprues (one for miniatures of standard size, a second one for
miniatures with “Strength 4” size and a third one for Big Guys) and several
more items: two Kaos Pitches (Puzzle-like Hard Pitch and Rollable Plastic
Gaming Pitch), Kaos and Mutated
Football, racial Range
Ruler, a Kaos Cheerleader, a Kaos Flipping Coin, a Demon Apotehcary, a Set of 2
Kaos Dice, 1d6 Injury Dice and a Jumbo 1d8 Serious Injury Dice.
The sculpting of most of these miniatures has already
been made. But we need your help to speed up the casting process. That way, we
will be able to release the Meiko Kaos Team much sooner than what was initially
planned. Using Indiegogo as a platform to rise funds helps us a lot since we
can finance new miniatures and other interesting items, obtain feedback from
our customers and it gives us confidence to keep working on. In exchange
you will get some cool rewards.
All the miniatures will be casted in metal. The master
moulds will be made by Miniaturas Alemany, the mouldmaker of other successful
Fantasy Football Indiegogo campaigns like the Willy Goblin Team and the Willy
Amazon Team. 
The sculptor of all the miniatures of this team is Franarcilla, the skilled
sculptor of many other Meiko teams like the Kaos Dwarf, Undead, Necromantic,
Ogre, Goblin, Rotter, Orc and Wood Elf Teams, just to mention some of them.
Franarcilla is one of Meiko Miniatures flagship sculptors. His dark sculpting
style specially fits with all the chaotic races, and his Kaos minis will fit
with the image we all have in mind when we think about this team. Currently,
Franarcilla is considered by many Fantasy Football fans as one of the best and
most talented Fantasy Football sculptors worldwide.

It is actually very simple. Imagine you point a smartphone or tablet pc camera at an object and see not only the object itself, but also all information about it on the screen of your device. You can also add some real-time effects that change the look of that object beyond recognition. For example, you point the camera of the smartphone on the ruins of the ancient castle, and the screen at once displays when the castle was built, who lived there, what happened to it, etc. And then, with the aid of an App these ruins are magically transformed into a new building, taking you several centuries back and giving you the possibility of getting insight into the Middle Ages. This is exactly what we call augmented reality, and ARbot and ARtank give us access to it.</p><p>Or you come into a fitting-room, choose the image of the suit you like, and on the screen of the device you see how the suit fits you without actually having to try it on. Seriously cool, isn’t it?!</p><p>Nowadays, augmented reality penetrates actively into daily life, and our ambitious project is a good example. Soon everyone will be able to buy the ARbot robot and take part in tank battles. The reality is explained by the material character of the robot, and its movements in the real environment.  The virtual world is shown by the real manipulations on the mobile device.</p><p>For the last few years the line between reality and the virtual world has become more and more blurred. This fact is supported by the phenomena of augmented reality – modern technology used by millions of people.  </p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Great For The Kids in Your Life</b></p><p></p><p><i></i></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1417096/files/20150426172351-____2015-04-23___18.35.26.png?1430094231"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Fully Interactive </b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1417100/files/20150426172530-____2015-04-22___23.11.52.png?1430094330"" src="""" style=""width: 626.663522012579px; height: 349px;""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Live Objects  Appear Normal</b> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1417102/files/20150426172600-____2015-04-22___23.09.31.png?1430094360"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 630.659025787966px; height: 355px; background-color: initial;""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Create Your Own Tank Battles and Battlefields</b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1409721/files/20150423122946-____2015-04-22___23.30.49.png?1429817386"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></b></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p>The ARbot robot is high-quality entertainment for grown-ups and children that combines reality with a virtual world.

The battery charge usually lasts between 1.5-3 hours.</p><p>This robot is a great present for children and adults! Anyone can create real tank battles at home, at the office or at special playing grounds. ARbot can also be transformed into a racing car that can go up to 1.2 meters per second, which means you can have Formula 1 racing at home, or in the office during the break-time. </p><p>The play will last till the end of the robot’s battery.

ARbot robot and ARtank app are designed to work together for robot regulation. How does it work in practice? First, you need to buy the robot, and download the App to your smartphone or tablet pc.

  With the help of ARbot
and special ARtank App you can plunge into augmented reality, making real tank
battles in your office, at home, or anywhere you want!  Augmented realityWhat exactly is augmented reality? It is actually very simple. Imagine you point a smartphone or tablet pc camera at an object and see not only the object itself, but also all information about it on the screen of your device. You can also add some real-time effects that change the look of that object beyond recognition. For example, you point the camera of the smartphone on the ruins of the ancient castle, and the screen at once displays when the castle was built, who lived there, what happened to it, etc. And then, with the aid of an App these ruins are magically transformed into a new building, taking you several centuries back and giving you the possibility of getting insight into the Middle Ages. This is exactly what we call augmented reality, and ARbot and ARtank give us access to it.Or you come into a fitting-room, choose the image of the suit you like, and on the screen of the device you see how the suit fits you without actually having to try it on. Seriously cool, isn’t it?!Nowadays, augmented reality penetrates actively into daily life, and our ambitious project is a good example. Soon everyone will be able to buy the ARbot robot and take part in tank battles. The reality is explained by the material character of the robot, and its movements in the real environment.  The virtual world is shown by the real manipulations on the mobile device.For the last few years the line between reality and the virtual world has become more and more blurred. This fact is supported by the phenomena of augmented reality – modern technology used by millions of people.  Great For The Kids in Your LifeFully Interactive Live Objects  Appear Normal Create Your Own Tank Battles and BattlefieldsThe ARbot robot is high-quality entertainment for grown-ups and children that combines reality with a virtual world. It has a spherical form (13 cm in diameter and 350 grams of weight) and moves via rotation of its two hemispheres that operate together with a shifted center of gravity to help it surmount different obstacles.The robot is remotely controlled, charged with either a micro USB device or inductive wireless charge (carbon version). The battery charge usually lasts between 1.5-3 hours.This robot is a great present for children and adults! Anyone can create real tank battles at home, at the office or at special playing grounds. ARbot can also be transformed into a racing car that can go up to 1.2 meters per second, which means you can have Formula 1 racing at home, or in the office during the break-time. The play will last till the end of the robot’s battery. The set also includes a special cube that functions as a tank regulation base.Sound unreal? This is possible thanks to augmented reality! ARbot robot and ARtank app are designed to work together for robot regulation. How does it work in practice? First, you need to buy the robot, and download the App to your smartphone or tablet pc. Then you simply point your camera on the robot and see a real tank on the screen that can shoot and be equipped with different armament, features,  etc. The tank moves in a real world, for example, on the floor of the sitting-room between the objects of the interior.Great Perks Just For YouWhite, Green, Purple, Pink, Yellow, Black - CHOOSE YOUR OWN COLOR!     White, Green, Purple, Pink, Yellow, Black - CHOOSE YOUR OWN COLOR!    White, Green, Purple, Pink, Yellow, Black - CHOOSE YOUR OWN COLOR!     White, Green, Purple, Pink, Yellow, Black - CHOOSE YOUR OWN COLOR!_____________________________________________________________________________INTRODUCING THE SUPER STRONG & ULTRA MODERN CARBON EDITION TECH SPEC (STANDARD ARBOT)Rotating like a real tank (using hemisphere)                                          Battery life in active mode up to 3 hours                                               Adaptive Tank positioning system                                                Average speed 40-50 cm/second                                                 2 gears - forward and  backward                                                          Easy calibration mode                                                            Bluetooth connector                                                            Micro USB charger                                                               Diameter - 13 cm

tank battles because of the popularity of one online-game. Now these battles

Our Plan

Our plan is to sell as many RollOut box games as possible and then create the mobile version of RollOut to share it with everyone worldwide.
If we reach our primary goal:
Primary Goal $6000 we build the RollOut single player, single server playing against AI players
RollOut Prototype

Secondary Goal $15,000 we build the RollOut multiplayer online.
For both mobile game options we are going to need funding for the game developer to create a mobile framework complete from front-end(UI/UX design and mockups) to back-end(player information, player accounts and banking).   The rest of the funds would go towards the to the hosting App store accounts, marketing , creating ads for the game, sharing ads with similar games, supporting cost the website and the art work costs.

<h1 style=""direction: rtl;""><span>لماذا الوصول المبكر (Early Access)؟</span></h1>
<p></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""><span>لعبتنا هي لعبة جماعية على الإنترنت. الوصول المبكر مهم جدا للألعاب الجماعية حتى نتأكد من أن تجربة اللاعبين ستكون ممتعة. وأيضا لنحل جميع المشاكل الممكنة قبل الإصدار الفعلي للعبة. وهذا أيضا سيساعدنا على أخذ آرائكم في تحسين اللعبة ومحتواها. كل هذا لن يحصل إلا بآراء اللاعبين ومقترحاتهم!</span></p>
<h1 style=""direction: rtl;""><span><br/></span></h1>
<h1 style=""direction: rtl;""><span>الأخطار والتحديات</span></h1>
<p></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""><span>لعبتنا مرت بعدة مراحل تطوير وما زالت قيد التطوير. لذلك الأخطار في اللعبة ذاتها قليلة. نعتقد أن أكبر خطر هو عدم وصولنا للمبلغ المطلوب في هذه الحملة حيث أن اللعبة في هذه الحالة لن تكون بالشكل المطلوب الذي نريده.</span></p>
<div style=""direction: rtl;""><br/></div>
<p style=""direction: rtl;"">الخطر الآخر هو عدم قبول لعبتنا على Greenlight في ستيم. في هذه الحالة سنبحث عن منصات أخرى لنشر لعبتنا. ولكن، نحن واثقون من قدرتنا (بمساعدتكم) من تعدينا لGreenlight.</p>
<div style=""direction: rtl;""><br/></div>
<p style=""direction: rtl;"">لذلك كما لاحظتكم أيها الداعمون، نحن نعتمد عليكم كثيرا وعلى دعمكم. هذا ما يمكنكم فعله لتقليل المخاطر على المشروع:</p>

<p style=""direction: rtl;""><span></span></p>
<p>سيتم أخذ المنصات الأخرى بالحسبان مثل لنكس أو البلايستيشن أو الإكسبوكس ، لكنهم الآن ليسوا الأولوية. نريد أن نهتم باللعبة أولا.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""><span><br/></span></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""><b><span>هل هناك نسخة CD/DVD/BLURAY نستطيع شراءها؟</span></b></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""><span>لا. مع حجم فريقنا الحالي، نريد توجيه كل جهودنا في تحسين اللعبة وليس في أمور أخرى قد تضر تطوير اللعبة.</span></p>
<div style=""direction: rtl;""><br/></div>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""><b><span>هل ستكون هناك أهداف إضافية عندما تصلون إلى هدفكم الأساسي؟</span></b></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""><span>نعم. عندما نقترب من إنهاء الهدف الأساسي، سيتم إعلان الأهداف الإضافية.</span></p>
<div style=""direction: rtl;""><br/></div>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""><b><span>أليس 12 ألف دولار مبلغا قليلا لللعبة التي تنوون عملها؟ </span></b></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""><span>سؤال جميل! هل تعمل في مجال الألعاب؟ هذا صحيح. تقديراتنا الأساسية لتطوير اللعبة بشكل كامل هي أكثر من المبلغ الذي نحتاجه. لكن باختصار، هذا ما حدث: إذا كان هناك عدد كاف من الناس متحمسين للعبتنا وأوصلونا إلى هدفنا المبدئي، فنحن كمطورين سنضع نقودنا أيضا معهم. في الحقيقة، لقد وضعنا نقودنا في اللعبة قبلكم، فقد تحملنا تكاليف التطوير من مدخراتنا وعملنا على اللعبة من غير رواتب خلال الفترة الماضية. لذلك، لا. هذه ليست حالة نتمنى فيها أن يتم دعمنا 100 ضعف ما كنا نتوقعه. قمنا بدراسة هذا الرقم بشكل دقيق وهذا ما توصلنا إليه. إذا وصلنا إلى هدفنا، سنتمكن من إيصال اللعبة بالشكل الذي نريده.</span></p>
<div style=""direction: rtl;""><br/></div>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""><b><span>أليس 12 ألف دولار مبلغا مبالغ فيه لللعبة التي تنوون عملها؟</span></b></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""><span>لحظة، صحيح أن لعبتنا ثنائية الأبعاد. لكن هذا لا يعني أنها ليست مشروع كامل بجميع العوامل. فنحن نحتاج مطورين ورسامين ومصممين ومحركين وموسيقاريين. ولقد تكفلنا شخصيا ببعض التكاليف، لكن لدينا حد.</span></p>
<div style=""direction: rtl;""><p><span>باختصار، نتفهم السؤال، لكن صدق أو لا تصدق، هذا أقل مبلغ  من الممكن نطلبه منكم لعمل اللعبة.</span></p></div>

<p style=""direction: rtl;""><b><span>دعمت المشروع! أم الفلة! متى توصلني اللعبة على ستيم؟</span></b></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""><span>جميل! نحتاج اللعبة يصير لها greenlit! لذلك أول حاجة تسويها انك تدعم اللعبة على ستيم وتقول لكل أصحابك يدعموها. وبإذن الله سيتم تجاوز هذه المرحلة.</span></p>
<div style=""direction: rtl;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">عند قبول اللعبة على steam سنأخذ بعض الوقت للعمل على إضافة الأكواد الخاصة بستيم في لعبتنا، ومن ثم سنطلق اللعبة مباشرة على ستيم كوصول مبكر (early access). في هذه الأثناء ادعم المشروع بنشر اللعبة عند الجميع!</span></div>
<div style=""direction: rtl;""><br/></div>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""><b><span>حسنا، ولكن متى ستصدر اللعبة بشكل نهائي على ستيم؟</span></b></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""></p>
<p style=""direction: rtl;""><span>سنضع اللعبة كوصول مبكر. عندها سيشارك اللاعبين في تحسين وتطوير اللعبة. ولن تصدر اللعبة بشكل كامل حتى نكون متأكدين من أنها جاهزة، ثم سننشر تاريخ الإصدار.</span></p>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">What is SOS: Shout Of Survival?</span><br/>
</h1>
<p>A multi-player SHOUTING (not shooting) game where 2 monsters hunt down 2 humans that are trying to reunite.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460599553/HowItWorksPhotoFinal_ggshxi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>SOS: Shout Of Survival is being developed for the PC and MAC with gamepad support (of course!), and will be made available through Steam. Other platforms, like Linux, are considered but are not a high priority.</p>
<p>In the darkness with minimum vision, Humans shout out to each other. They will know their corresponding location by hearing and following the sound direction.</p>
<p>However! The monsters will also hear them and will run to the humans before they reunite as they can also hear them.</p>
<p>The Monsters have a constant scary sound ongoing, so humans will be able to hear monsters incoming and will be able to also assess the direction from their scary sound.</p>
<p>The Monsters have a special ability where they can HIDE their voice for few seconds, AND THIS IS WHERE IT IS FUN for the monsters. As soon as they think they are approaching a human, they can hide their sound and close in to the humans to give them the scare (and death) or their lives!</p>

<h1>Where did this project come from?</h1>
<p>SOS: Shout of Survival is based on our critically acclaimed game jam winner (Reunion). Even YouTubers like Markiplier played our original game and had positive feedback.  After observing the positive vibe that Reunion generated, it was clear that a game about hearing works very well.  As a result, we decided to take it to the next step.</p>

<h1>Why Early Access</h1>
<p>SOS: Shout Of Survival is primarily a multiplayer game with online play. Early Access is especially important for games with a strong multiplayer component, to ensure a robust online experience, but also to balance and tweak the gameplay. The only way to achieve this is by getting feedback from lots of players.</p>
<h1>Risks and Challenges</h1>
<p>The game has already gone through lots of development cycles and is already in production, so risks within the game itself should be minimum and close to none. However, our highest concern is not getting funded to continue development on the game. We want to present the game in the way we really want it to be.</p>
<br/><p>Another risk in not getting Greenlit. In that case, we will be checking other distribution solutions. However, we trust that, with your help, we should be able to get Greenlit.</p>
<br/><p>So, as you may have noticed dear supporters, It relies heavily on the support we get from you! Here is what you can do to minimize the risk:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>PICK A PERK</p></li>
<li><p>SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS</p></li>
<li><p>SUPPORT US IN GREENLIGHT</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks &lt;3</p>

<br/><br/><h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><b>Will you/ can you/ make a version for Linux?</b></p>
<p>With our current small team setup, we are not very familiar with Linux operating system and promising a version for Linux without us being able to properly test the game on the system is not something we want. However, when we are going full throttle, we will highly check that option.</p>
<br/><p><b>Is there any way to get some kind of physical copy of the game itself?</b></p>
<p>Not currently, no. With our team size, we would like to be able to focus more on the game itself rather than anything that is not game related. Adding more things that require logistics might only harm the game in the end and we would love to commit to the game itself.</p>
<br/><p><b>Will there be stretch goals later?</b></p>
<p>Yes, once we meet our target goal, stretch goals will be immediately announced.</p>
<br/><p><b>Isn’t $12k a little cheap for the game you are promising?</b></p>
<p>Good question! Let us guess—you’ve worked in the game industry? :) Yes, it’s true—our internal estimates for the full production cost of this game are greater than our initial goal, especially once you take out the fees and reward costs. But that’s OK!</p>
<p>To put it simply, if enough fans are excited about this game to hit our initial goal, then we, the developers of this game, are willing to put up more of our own money as well, right along there with you. We actually already did. We have been developing this game without salaries and we’ve been handling the costs so far from our personal savings.</p>
<p>So, no, this is not a case where the initial goal is set irresponsibly low, risking everything in the hopes that the Indiegogo campaign will pay off over expectations and get us where we secretly, actually need to be financially. We do understand that concern, though, and kept it in mind when carefully setting our initial funding goal. More money over the initial goal would be wonderful—don’t get us wrong! :). But we have run the numbers and we are fully confident that, should we hit our initial goal and nothing more, we can make a great game that fulfills the promise of this project, both for our backers and for anyone else who plays the game.</p>
<br/><p><b>Isn’t $12k a little expensive for the game you are promising?</b></p>
<p>Seriously, despite the fact that it’s a 2D game, SOS is a full-scale production where the game is undertaken by professional developers, artists, designers, animators and musicians. We as indie developers already handled some costs, but we reach our limit.</p>
<p>In short, we can understand the question, but believe it or not, this is actually a very cheap minimum bar to set for this team and this project, especially after fees and reward costs are taken out. We set it as low as we could to make it happen, because we really, REALLY want to make sure it happens!</p>
<br/><p><b>I backed the project! Woohoo! ...When will I get my game on steam?</b></p>
<p>First of all, we need to get greenlit. We will need the support of all our fans for this! After being greenlit, we will incorporate Steam API for the multiplayer to work. This should take some time, however, we will be putting the game on Steam as early access as soon as integrating the steam API is done. Meanwhile, please share the excitement with your friends and invite them to support us too, we’d really appreciate it!</p>
<br/><p><b>Alright! But when will it be finally released?</b></p>
<p>Ok so here is our plan. After putting the game as early access, we will be hearing from our fans a lot as we improve the game and add features based on feedback. Once we believe the game reached a level where it can be released, a release date will be announced. However, you are always welcome to buy the game from the early access period. This way you don’t have to wait at all!</p>
<br/><p><b>What if you don’t get Greenlit?</b></p>
<p>Well, that would be unfortunate. In that case, we would be looking for other platforms to release the game on or we can even release it ourselves.</p>
<br/><p><b>Will you give me any revenue for my sound or my character design?</b></p>
<p>No, sadly. Even though we would collaborate with you to produce those contents in the game, we are still doing most of the work. Even though we initially start with your idea, we would still need to make sure it fits the game and its mechanics.</p>

الأهداف الإضافية


ما هي SOS: Shout of Survival؟هي لعبة نداء جماعية على الإنترنت (اونلاين). بشريان يناديان بعضهما ليلتقيان، ووحشان يحاولان اصطيادهما قبل أن يلتقي البشريان.في الظلام الدامس وبرؤية محدودة، يحاول البشريان أن يجدا بعضهما. كل ما عليهم فعله هو أن ينادوا على بعضهما. عندما يفعلان ذلك، سيسمعان صوت الشخص الآخر ويعرفان اتجاه الصوت. وعندها يستطيع البشري ملاحقة اتجاه الصوت.لاحظ أن الوحوش أيضا يستطيعون سماع صوت النداء وسيتبعون ذلك الصوت لاصطياد أي من البشر.الوحش لديه صوت مخيف وهذا الصوت يعمل دائما. لذلك يستطيع البشر سماع هذا الصوت عندما يقترب الوحش. وهذا سيساعد البشر على تفادي أماكن الوحوش من اتجاه أصواتهم.ولكن، لدى الوحوش خاصية إخفاء هذا الصوت مؤقتا لبضع ثوان. وهذا هو الجزء الممتع للوحوش، حيث أنهم يستطيعون إخفاء صوتهم بمجرد الاقتراب من البشر. وهذا سيساعدهم على مباغتة البشري و الهجوم عليهم وإفزاعهم!SOS: Shout of Survival حاليا يتم تطويرها لأجهزة الPC والMAC مع دعم ليد التحكم وسيتم إصدار اللعبة على ستيم. وسيتم أخذ المنصات الأخرى بالحسبان مثل لنكس أو البلايستيشن أو الإكسبوكس ، لكنهم الآن ليسوا الأولوية. نريد أن نهتم باللعبة أولا.نود أيضا التنبيه أن هذا المشروع هو Fixed Funding Project. وهذا يعني أنه لن نحصل على المبلغ حتى نصل للهدف. وإن لم نصل للهدف، فلن نأخذ شيئا. لذلك، دعمكم لنا مهم جدا.

جرب النسخة التجريبية على GameJolt



النسخة التجريبية موجودة على موقع GameJolt! http://gamejolt.com/games/sos-shout-of-survival-demo/143676


هذه النسخة تعتبر جزء صغير مما ستكون عليه اللعبة عند إطلاقها بشكلها الكامل.
هناك الكثير من الخصائص في اللعبة الكاملة والتي لم نضفها في النسخة التجريبية هذه.‎




من أين أتى هذا المشروع؟

هذه اللعبة مبنية على لعبتنا الشهيرة الفائزة بالمركز الأول في زنقة الألعاب المعروفة باسم: ""اللقاء"". بعد نشر اللقاء، اتضح لنا أن لعبةً تعتمد على الاستماع كانت فكرة جيدة. حتى أن بعض اللاعبين على يوتيوب مثل ماركبلاير لعب اللعبة وكان لديه انطباع إيجابي عن اللعبة. فقررنا أخذ الخطوة القادمة.


مزايا اللعبة

1. أسلوب لعب مميز معتمد على الاستماع. من الأفضل لك أن تستخدم سماعات الرأس!

لماذا الوصول المبكر (Early Access)؟

لعبتنا هي لعبة جماعية على الإنترنت. الوصول المبكر مهم جدا للألعاب الجماعية حتى نتأكد من أن تجربة اللاعبين ستكون ممتعة. وأيضا لنحل جميع المشاكل الممكنة قبل الإصدار الفعلي للعبة. وهذا أيضا سيساعدنا على أخذ آرائكم في تحسين اللعبة ومحتواها. كل هذا لن يحصل إلا بآراء اللاعبين ومقترحاتهم!

الأخطار والتحديات

لعبتنا مرت بعدة مراحل تطوير وما زالت قيد التطوير. لذلك الأخطار في اللعبة ذاتها قليلة. نعتقد أن أكبر خطر هو عدم وصولنا للمبلغ المطلوب في هذه الحملة حيث أن اللعبة في هذه الحالة لن تكون بالشكل المطلوب الذي نريده.

الخطر الآخر هو عدم قبول لعبتنا على Greenlight في ستيم. في هذه الحالة سنبحث عن منصات أخرى لنشر لعبتنا. ولكن، نحن واثقون من قدرتنا (بمساعدتكم) من تعدينا لGreenlight.

لذلك كما لاحظتكم أيها الداعمون، نحن نعتمد عليكم كثيرا وعلى دعمكم. هذا ما يمكنكم فعله لتقليل المخاطر على المشروع:
1. اختر واحدة من المكافآت واشتر اللعبة2. شارك اللعبة مع أصدقائك3. ادعمنا في ستيم جرين لايتشكرا!

أسئلة وأجوبة
هل ستعملون على نسخة لنكس أو بلايستيشن؟


سيتم أخذ المنصات الأخرى بالحسبان مثل لنكس أو البلايستيشن أو الإكسبوكس ، لكنهم الآن ليسوا الأولوية. نريد أن نهتم باللعبة أولا.


هل هناك نسخة CD/DVD/BLURAY نستطيع شراءها؟

لا. مع حجم فريقنا الحالي، نريد توجيه كل جهودنا في تحسين اللعبة وليس في أمور أخرى قد تضر تطوير اللعبة.

هل ستكون هناك أهداف إضافية عندما تصلون إلى هدفكم الأساسي؟

نعم. عندما نقترب من إنهاء الهدف الأساسي، سيتم إعلان الأهداف الإضافية.

أليس 12 ألف دولار مبلغا قليلا لللعبة التي تنوون عملها؟ 

سؤال جميل! هل تعمل في مجال الألعاب؟ هذا صحيح. تقديراتنا الأساسية لتطوير اللعبة بشكل كامل هي أكثر من المبلغ الذي نحتاجه. لكن باختصار، هذا ما حدث: إذا كان هناك عدد كاف من الناس متحمسين للعبتنا وأوصلونا إلى هدفنا المبدئي، فنحن كمطورين سنضع نقودنا أيضا معهم. في الحقيقة، لقد وضعنا نقودنا في اللعبة قبلكم، فقد تحملنا تكاليف التطوير من مدخراتنا وعملنا على اللعبة من غير رواتب خلال الفترة الماضية. لذلك، لا. هذه ليست حالة نتمنى فيها أن يتم دعمنا 100 ضعف ما كنا نتوقعه. قمنا بدراسة هذا الرقم بشكل دقيق وهذا ما توصلنا إليه. إذا وصلنا إلى هدفنا، سنتمكن من إيصال اللعبة بالشكل الذي نريده.

أليس 12 ألف دولار مبلغا مبالغ فيه لللعبة التي تنوون عملها؟

لحظة، صحيح أن لعبتنا ثنائية الأبعاد. لكن هذا لا يعني أنها ليست مشروع كامل بجميع العوامل. فنحن نحتاج مطورين ورسامين ومصممين ومحركين وموسيقاريين. ولقد تكفلنا شخصيا ببعض التكاليف، لكن لدينا حد.
باختصار، نتفهم السؤال، لكن صدق أو لا تصدق، هذا أقل مبلغ  من الممكن نطلبه منكم لعمل اللعبة.

دعمت المشروع! أم الفلة! متى توصلني اللعبة على ستيم؟

جميل! نحتاج اللعبة يصير لها greenlit! لذلك أول حاجة تسويها انك تدعم اللعبة على ستيم وتقول لكل أصحابك يدعموها. وبإذن الله سيتم تجاوز هذه المرحلة.
عند قبول اللعبة على steam سنأخذ بعض الوقت للعمل على إضافة الأكواد الخاصة بستيم في لعبتنا، ومن ثم سنطلق اللعبة مباشرة على ستيم كوصول مبكر (early access). في هذه الأثناء ادعم المشروع بنشر اللعبة عند الجميع!

حسنا، ولكن متى ستصدر اللعبة بشكل نهائي على ستيم؟

سنضع اللعبة كوصول مبكر. عندها سيشارك اللاعبين في تحسين وتطوير اللعبة. ولن تصدر اللعبة بشكل كامل حتى نكون متأكدين من أنها جاهزة، ثم سننشر تاريخ الإصدار.

ماذا لو لم تستطيعوا تجاوز Greenlight؟

للأسف، عندها سنضطر للبحث عن خيارات أخرى أو حتى نشرها بأنفسنا.

What is SOS: Shout Of Survival?

A multi-player SHOUTING (not shooting) game where 2 monsters hunt down 2 humans that are trying to reunite.

SOS: Shout Of Survival is being developed for the PC and MAC with gamepad support (of course!), and will be made available through Steam. Other platforms, like Linux, are considered but are not a high priority.
In the darkness with minimum vision, Humans shout out to each other. They will know their corresponding location by hearing and following the sound direction.
However! The monsters will also hear them and will run to the humans before they reunite as they can also hear them.
The Monsters have a constant scary sound ongoing, so humans will be able to hear monsters incoming and will be able to also assess the direction from their scary sound.
The Monsters have a special ability where they can HIDE their voice for few seconds, AND THIS IS WHERE IT IS FUN for the monsters. As soon as they think they are approaching a human, they can hide their sound and close in to the humans to give them the scare (and death) or their lives!
We’d like to note that this project is a Fixed Funding project. Which means that we either reach our goal and take it all or fail and leave empty handed. So we really need your support to make this happen.

We would also love your support in getting the game greenlit on Steam, please go there and support our game to be greenlit!

The demo is live and ready! You can have a shot on our small version of the game go ahead to GAMEJOLT and play SOS: Shout of Survival though this link: http://gamejolt.com/games/sos-shout-of-survival...
PLEASE NOTE: that the demo is only a representation of a part of what the final version could look like. There are many features that are not included in this demo such as more levels, customization options, playing with friends, animations, music and much much more.
Where did this project come from?
SOS: Shout of Survival is based on our critically acclaimed game jam winner (Reunion). Even YouTubers like Markiplier played our original game and had positive feedback.  After observing the positive vibe that Reunion generated, it was clear that a game about hearing works very well.  As a result, we decided to take it to the next step.


SOS: Shout Of Survival Features

Unique gameplay that focuses on sound. Better use your headphones!
Different playstyles as a human and a monster. Being the hunter is always different than being hunted!
Easy to learn gameplay. Learn the controls and start playing right away!
Online Multiplayer: Play with random people from all over the world.
Play with friends: Or you can play with your friends by inviting them to your matches.
9 fun levels and more with updates.

What more?We also plan to add finishing moves for the monsters when they catch humans, which should be fun of course! Here are some ideas of what we plan to do:

Why Early Access
SOS: Shout Of Survival is primarily a multiplayer game with online play. Early Access is especially important for games with a strong multiplayer component, to ensure a robust online experience, but also to balance and tweak the gameplay. The only way to achieve this is by getting feedback from lots of players.
Risks and Challenges
The game has already gone through lots of development cycles and is already in production, so risks within the game itself should be minimum and close to none. However, our highest concern is not getting funded to continue development on the game. We want to present the game in the way we really want it to be.
Another risk in not getting Greenlit. In that case, we will be checking other distribution solutions. However, we trust that, with your help, we should be able to get Greenlit.
So, as you may have noticed dear supporters, It relies heavily on the support we get from you! Here is what you can do to minimize the risk:

FAQ
Will you/ can you/ make a version for Linux?
With our current small team setup, we are not very familiar with Linux operating system and promising a version for Linux without us being able to properly test the game on the system is not something we want. However, when we are going full throttle, we will highly check that option.
Is there any way to get some kind of physical copy of the game itself?
Not currently, no. With our team size, we would like to be able to focus more on the game itself rather than anything that is not game related. Adding more things that require logistics might only harm the game in the end and we would love to commit to the game itself.
Will there be stretch goals later?
Yes, once we meet our target goal, stretch goals will be immediately announced.
Isn’t $12k a little cheap for the game you are promising?
Good question! Let us guess—you’ve worked in the game industry? :) Yes, it’s true—our internal estimates for the full production cost of this game are greater than our initial goal, especially once you take out the fees and reward costs. But that’s OK!
To put it simply, if enough fans are excited about this game to hit our initial goal, then we, the developers of this game, are willing to put up more of our own money as well, right along there with you. We actually already did. We have been developing this game without salaries and we’ve been handling the costs so far from our personal savings.
So, no, this is not a case where the initial goal is set irresponsibly low, risking everything in the hopes that the Indiegogo campaign will pay off over expectations and get us where we secretly, actually need to be financially. We do understand that concern, though, and kept it in mind when carefully setting our initial funding goal. More money over the initial goal would be wonderful—don’t get us wrong! :). But we have run the numbers and we are fully confident that, should we hit our initial goal and nothing more, we can make a great game that fulfills the promise of this project, both for our backers and for anyone else who plays the game.
Isn’t $12k a little expensive for the game you are promising?
Seriously, despite the fact that it’s a 2D game, SOS is a full-scale production where the game is undertaken by professional developers, artists, designers, animators and musicians. We as indie developers already handled some costs, but we reach our limit.
In short, we can understand the question, but believe it or not, this is actually a very cheap minimum bar to set for this team and this project, especially after fees and reward costs are taken out. We set it as low as we could to make it happen, because we really, REALLY want to make sure it happens!
I backed the project! Woohoo! ...When will I get my game on steam?
First of all, we need to get greenlit. We will need the support of all our fans for this! After being greenlit, we will incorporate Steam API for the multiplayer to work. This should take some time, however, we will be putting the game on Steam as early access as soon as integrating the steam API is done. Meanwhile, please share the excitement with your friends and invite them to support us too, we’d really appreciate it!
Alright! But when will it be finally released?
Ok so here is our plan. After putting the game as early access, we will be hearing from our fans a lot as we improve the game and add features based on feedback. Once we believe the game reached a level where it can be released, a release date will be announced. However, you are always welcome to buy the game from the early access period. This way you don’t have to wait at all!
What if you don’t get Greenlit?
Well, that would be unfortunate. In that case, we would be looking for other platforms to release the game on or we can even release it ourselves.
Will you give me any revenue for my sound or my character design?
No, sadly. Even though we would collaborate with you to produce those contents in the game, we are still doing most of the work. Even though we initially start with your idea, we would still need to make sure it fits the game and its mechanics.

Nowhere

Key to
Nowhere is a game about decisions. What to sacrifice? Hope, trust, mercy,  ambition, the truth? Set in a sci-fi enviroment, your decisions will involve landind a ship while keeping the crew alive, surviving as shipwrecks after a crash landing on the ocean, giving a statement before the law about your mission, and many other situations to handle.

Platforms
and Technology

Key to
Nowhere is a lowpoly art point’n’click adventure being developed
with Gdevelop and our plans include a version for PC, Mac, Linux, and
also mobile versions for iOS and Android.We work with opensource software, so, all tools used and game engine are opensource software.The game art is made with lowpoly 3D, with minimalist colors and objects.

Origins

Key to
Nowhere started as a studying game for a game design course, but as we started to play around with possible ideas for further puzzles and plot development, the game concept matured into a serious script. We then designed and programmed the first chapter of the game as a demonstration and an introduction to the game we are developing.You can check the demo minigame here:http://rizomatico.org/games/keytonowhereFull
Game

The full
game is divided into seven chapters, through which Drisden and the surviving crew mambers of the spaceship need to manage, bargain, persuade, and even fight to survive.
Chapter
one: Give us a chance: Drisden is awaken
from hibernation to land the spaceship on which he travels. Having lost its route after suffering magnetic interference and hull damage, the spaceship is about to crash into a planet's atmosphere.  Navigation Droid R-Type explains the protagonist that he has 24hrs to set the coordinates and land the ship while managing oxigen supply for crew members; fire control in supply room, and energy cells charge.  We've created this chapter in such a way that the player experiences the same feelings as the main character, who is lost, dizzy, confused, and still responsible for saving your crew's lives as well as your own.Screenshot: Key to knowhere, chapter 1.The camera angle is a way to bring a confinement feeling.

This chapter is avaiable as a demo minigame: You can play it at GAMEJOLT, here is the Link:http://gamejolt.com/games/other/key-to-nowhere/59974/

From GameJolt you can follow the gameplays, rate and comment. Now we have more than 12.8k plays, and we are rated 4 jolts out of 5.



Game Review by Brett Ultimus at Youtube, played from GameJolt.





Chapter
two: This cruel, cold world: After the crash, the surviving crew members are shipwrecked on the ocean. You need to manage the scarce food and water rations, medicine, protection against the enviroment, signals and communications, and also everybody's moods.


Here is the first test layout:


For this second chapter, we've decided to work with isometric layout.


Chapter
three: Justice, the blind - After being rescued Drisden has to give a statement before court, about the accident. By the talks of lawyers and prosecutors, there is much about your mission that he never knew about. Be witty and try to collect key information about the spaceship fiasco.


Chapter
four: a new mission -  The outcome of the trial seems favorable to all, and Drisden, promoted, is sent on another mission. Right after leaving the planet's atmosphere, Drisden's crew goes rogue on him. Hidden in the supply room, he has to re-take control of the ship. 


Chapter
five: dark side of the moon - Arriving on the moon, Drisden changes his planned route and discovers a classified facility that might be enslaving moon people. Set up a rebbelion in the factory while preserving workers' lives. 


Chapter
six: behind bars - After liberating a slave factory on the moon, Drisden is arrested and put in a penitential vessel. All are aware of Drisden's revolutionary capacities, so he receives a rough and careful treatment in jail. Survive the penal vessel.


Chapter
seven: in a cozy, neat room: A high officer visits Drisden in prison and makes him an offer he can not decline. Drisden goes back to Earth and is put in a private room with all the military and political authorities responsible for his space program. Negotiate or rebel? Make demands or clarify misdeeds? Stand for your rights or make new alliances?

<p></p></div>","*REFERRAL PROGRAM begins on March 23, 2014 until the end of this campaign on April 12, 2014.

We have created the Alice Of Wonderland Trading Card Game with easy and simple game rules for all age levels to be able to play. We know there are a lot of other trading card games out there, but we wanted to come up with a game that everyone will recognize, and also be easy to play right out of the box. We believe our Alice Of Wonderland Trading Card Game will do just that!Our game consists of characters based on a Steampunk Wonderland world, and also includes other fairy tale characters in the public domain that have been re-imagined. The trading card game for this project consists of 2 kingdom ""core"" decks, The Kingdom of Hearts, and The Kingdom of Roses. The project is set up with stretch goals to create these 2 decks.We are a graphic design firm consisting of 2 art and design studios, Sketch2Draw and FotogSyn, based out of Hampton Roads, Virginia, and together we have formed Alice Of Wonderland Entertainment. Our background consists of illustration, comic books, game design, commercial graphic design, event planning, branding, and entertainment production.Sketch2Draw is responsible for a lot of the cool art you see in the cards, and is constantly busy creating new artwork for the game. Sketch2Draw has been designing character concepts in the comic book and fantasy genre for over 20 years, and has now just teamed up with FotogSyn to create this new trading card game. Sketh2Draw also creates video tutorials on Youtube, and operates sketch2draw.com.FotogSyn is a graphic design studio (also helping in a lot of the cool art you'll be seeing in Alice of Wonderland). They deal in exclusive prints in a very limited quantity. Their focus is more on the quality and collectibility of items and merchandise, instead of just over saturating the market. FotogSyn has a background in the comic book illustration, character design, story creation, graphics, inking, marketing and product placement, and offers time-released limited edition prints available at comic book conventions and through their website, fotogsyn.com. We need your support to fund and make this game a reality. The funding for this trading card game will help with distribution and production of the game. The more it gets funded, the more things we will be able to produce!
The minimum funding goal of $500 will enable us to print the Kingdom of Hearts core deck without a custom tuck box. The decks will have cello-wrap in lieu of a tuck box, unless we reach the first stretch goal.
The first stretch goal of $1000 will allow us to create custom tuck boxes for the Kingdom of Hearts core decks. The Kingdom of Roses core decks will be released when we reach the second stretch goal of $2000. 
We will release exclusive rarity cards only at Wizard World St. Louis in April. More exclusive limited edition cards will be released at future Wizard World Comic Cons during the year.
We are offering limited 11x17 prints along with certain tier levels, each print is signed, numbered, stamped, with certificate of authenticity. 
Extra goodies may be created if we exceed our funding goals, which may include game mats and game coins. New stretch goals will be added as we exceed more funding during the campaign.

Please note that international shipping is added for shipping to other countries and will be adjusted at the end of the campaign.$1000 - Custom Tuck Box added for the Kingdom of Hearts Core Decks.At this stretch goal, we will be able to create the custom tuck boxes for the Kingdom of Hearts core decks.$2000 - Kingdom of Roses Core Deck Released (with Custom Tuck Box)At this stretch goal, we will be able to print the Kingdom of Roses core decks, with custom tuck boxes.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Rafm's Call of Cthulhu Indiegogo is a project to replace the models in the line and get you the game models you want now!</p>
<p>The RAFM Call of Cthulhu Miniatures line is award winning and iconic within the gaming industry. The line has existed since 1985 and still makes up an important part of our company sales. It is clear that rabid Call of Cthulhu fans want these miniatures to support their gaming. And why not? They're awesome miniatures at a terrific price!  Why wouldn't you like them?</p>
<p>However, we need to reconceive this line to appeal to a new era of gamers. As it turns out, miniatures are also really expensive to produce.  The sculpting and mold costs are enormous.  In order to reimagine this line, we can take our time by producing several new models over the next several years, or we can get support from the fans of Cthulhu mania and launch a bunch of new ones as soon as possible.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, we could possibly replace 8 figures in the Call of Cthulhu line. With this fundraising project we can remanufacture the entire line in one year's time: new character models, and new monsters, all at once.</p>
<p>We just need your support to make this campaign a success!</p>
<div class=""activity-content"">
<p><strong>Indiegogo and Flexible Funding</strong></p>
<p>Indiegogo was chosen as the funding vehicle for this project because we are a Canadian company and we do not currently qualify for funding on Kickstarter. You must be a citizen of the USA in order to qualify for that site. This is well documented on the internet. See our updates on our RAFM.com forums if you have a question about this.Some people have posted that we should use a proxy. This is both dangerous and has possible deep tax implications. We discussed this option and decided that we were a corporation in Canada and we would use the Indiegogo site.</p>
<p>Flexible funding was chosen to allow Paypal transactions as well as credit cards. This means that the funds you s</p>
<p>upport us with by using either your paypal account or your credit card will be withdrawn immediately from your account. It also means that we must supply you with the product whether we meet our minimum funded goal of $8000 or not. Therefore, anyone supporting this project will recieve the initial miniatures release proposed and then any stretch goals that are met depending upon their funding choice.The choice to use flexible funding has allowed us to get to work right away on these miniatures and add new sculptures and new artwork to the project in a timely manner, so thankyou to all that have already funded us.</p>
<p>Charges are applied when you decide to fund the project.<br/> This is copied directly from the IndieGoGo terms page. <a href=""http://support.indiegogo.com/entries/20566503-Fixed-vs-Flexible-Funding"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://support.indiegogo.com/entries/20566503-F...</a></p>
Please make sure you understand the terms before contributing. At this point we are committed to making 11 new Player characters, 4 new monsters and the Disk of R'lyeh for the line because we have received contributions.</div>
<p> <strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We realize that for a role playing game set in this genre you need models of characters and monsters that your players can interact with that won't cause those characters to go instantly insane or get immediately stomped. At this point five new investigator models and three new monsters will be completed regardless of whether or not our initial funding goal is met. Therefore, we have a number of opportunities available for our supporters.  </p>
<p>You can support our Player Character Miniatures and receive a number of new character miniatures based on the number of people who jump on board.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>You can support our Monsters Miniatures and receive a number of new monster miniatures based on the number of people who want to get new monsters for their collection.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>You can go all in for both deals, cost $100 and get new player characters and new monster miniatures based on the number of people that support us.</p>
<p>And the good news is that as the number of supporters rise, you will get more miniatures!</p>
<p>That's it, so support us now and go get your friends involved because it will mean more miniatures for you!</p>
<p> <strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>At the $9,000 USD mark new miniatures will be added to the program and continue being added as the campaign continues. By the $100,000 or approximately 1000 investors it is our plan to have 63 new models on their way to you for your initial investment of $100 USD. By the time we hit 2,000 investors most of the line should be remodeled. You can also select our add-on choices like the Cthulhu box set, Byatis and Dhole box set and the Miskatonic University Expedition sets which we will add throughout the program.</p>
<p>All miniatures are white metal and come unpainted. The scale is 32mm which is the industry accepted gaming standard. Some assembly may be required. Of course there will be variation from miniature to miniature depending on posing and sculpter. Also the monsters will be larger in size standing up to 100mm in some cases. These are high quality, hand sculpted metal miniatures worthy of any tabletop.</p>
<p>So here is your opportunity to support us in this great Call of Cthulhu adventure.</p>

<p> <strong>Who we Are</strong></p>
<p>This great project actually started decades ago and there is a talented team driven by a shared dream behind it. Our story begins over 37 years ago, when RAFM Company Inc, began producing rules and then miniatures for the gaming industry in 1979. RAFM Call of Cthulhu miniatures has probably been our most successful line. Envisioned and sculpted by Bob Murch for the Call of Cthulhu RPG by Chaosium Inc. the figures have transcended the industry and been reissued by many companies. None compare with the lasting tradition of the line. </p>
<p>This company, reborn in 1999 as Silver Fox Productions Inc., producing RAFM Miniatures, has a proven track record. Our miniatures have sold to thousands of people worldwide, and have received many awards  from the game industry. Other award winning lines include Siege Equipement, and WWII Vehicles. Our new lines include USX Modern Day Heroes, and the upcoming Airship Pirates Miniatures. The company has existed for several decades and will be around to support your gaming needs for years to come. All miniatures are produced for Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu Role-playing Game and continue to be an official licensed product for the Call of Cthulhu Role-playing Game TM.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Shipping and Handling Internationally so High?</strong></p>
<p>Eighty five white metal miniatures are very heavy for shipping purposes.

<p>For our European backers! After consulting with several logistics companies, we are happy to announce that we will be able to help you save money on import taxes.

MASTER DEAL IS BACK!
It seemed that most of our customers wanted the Master Deal so we brought it back. Please add shipping to your pledge. If you want to upgrade with +$10 extra you can get a copy of the Common Piece of the Disk of R'yleh.
 

 
Here is a graphic for the basic deals (Monster Minion, Investigator Extraordinaire and Mythos Mastermind) and all the stretch goals that these Perks entail.

Update! Get a Deal!
We opened the $12,000 Stretch Goal and the $20,000 Stretch Goal now giving you eleven Investigators and four Monsters in your Monster Minion, Investigator Extraordinaire or Mythos Mastermind Perks. So get your friends to buy.
Opening these stretch goals means the value of the miniatures to $4.54 per investigator and $11 per monster. Plus you have access to all the Stretch Goals still to be opened. Those miniatures will retail for $6 and $16 or more each. The price gets even better if you take advantage of the Investigator Deal and Monster Deal or if more stretch goals open. You can also take the Flying Polyp Add On or the Insanity Add On to get more miniatures.
If you want both the Investigator Deal and the Monster Deal please pledge twice. Thanks and let's get this program over the $20,000 mark.
 

***All Miniatures are unpainted 32mm white metal***


If you take a Monster Deal or an Investigator Deal than you will get $40 retail worth of product from the existing line for only $10 more. This is the way to get that bang for your buck. With the Investigator Deal your price per miniature would drop to $3.13 per miniature, and one of those is the 120mm tall Nyarlathotep miniature. Wow! So invite your friends and buy now. How about including a Flying Polyp Add-on or and Insanity Add-on, then you get even more product at deep discount.


Short Summary
Rafm's Call of Cthulhu Indiegogo is a project to replace the models in the line and get you the game models you want now!
The RAFM Call of Cthulhu Miniatures line is award winning and iconic within the gaming industry. The line has existed since 1985 and still makes up an important part of our company sales. It is clear that rabid Call of Cthulhu fans want these miniatures to support their gaming. And why not? They're awesome miniatures at a terrific price!  Why wouldn't you like them?
However, we need to reconceive this line to appeal to a new era of gamers. As it turns out, miniatures are also really expensive to produce.  The sculpting and mold costs are enormous.  In order to reimagine this line, we can take our time by producing several new models over the next several years, or we can get support from the fans of Cthulhu mania and launch a bunch of new ones as soon as possible.
By the end of the year, we could possibly replace 8 figures in the Call of Cthulhu line. With this fundraising project we can remanufacture the entire line in one year's time: new character models, and new monsters, all at once.
We just need your support to make this campaign a success!

Indiegogo and Flexible Funding
Indiegogo was chosen as the funding vehicle for this project because we are a Canadian company and we do not currently qualify for funding on Kickstarter. You must be a citizen of the USA in order to qualify for that site. This is well documented on the internet. See our updates on our RAFM.com forums if you have a question about this.Some people have posted that we should use a proxy. This is both dangerous and has possible deep tax implications. We discussed this option and decided that we were a corporation in Canada and we would use the Indiegogo site.
Flexible funding was chosen to allow Paypal transactions as well as credit cards. This means that the funds you s
upport us with by using either your paypal account or your credit card will be withdrawn immediately from your account. It also means that we must supply you with the product whether we meet our minimum funded goal of $8000 or not. Therefore, anyone supporting this project will recieve the initial miniatures release proposed and then any stretch goals that are met depending upon their funding choice.The choice to use flexible funding has allowed us to get to work right away on these miniatures and add new sculptures and new artwork to the project in a timely manner, so thankyou to all that have already funded us.
Charges are applied when you decide to fund the project. This is copied directly from the IndieGoGo terms page. http://support.indiegogo.com/entries/20566503-F...
Please make sure you understand the terms before contributing. At this point we are committed to making 11 new Player characters, 4 new monsters and the Disk of R'lyeh for the line because we have received contributions.
 What We Need & What You Get


We realize that for a role playing game set in this genre you need models of characters and monsters that your players can interact with that won't cause those characters to go instantly insane or get immediately stomped. At this point five new investigator models and three new monsters will be completed regardless of whether or not our initial funding goal is met. Therefore, we have a number of opportunities available for our supporters.  
You can support our Player Character Miniatures and receive a number of new character miniatures based on the number of people who jump on board.
Or
You can support our Monsters Miniatures and receive a number of new monster miniatures based on the number of people who want to get new monsters for their collection.
OR
You can go all in for both deals, cost $100 and get new player characters and new monster miniatures based on the number of people that support us.
And the good news is that as the number of supporters rise, you will get more miniatures!
That's it, so support us now and go get your friends involved because it will mean more miniatures for you!
 The Impact


At the $9,000 USD mark new miniatures will be added to the program and continue being added as the campaign continues. By the $100,000 or approximately 1000 investors it is our plan to have 63 new models on their way to you for your initial investment of $100 USD. By the time we hit 2,000 investors most of the line should be remodeled. You can also select our add-on choices like the Cthulhu box set, Byatis and Dhole box set and the Miskatonic University Expedition sets which we will add throughout the program.
All miniatures are white metal and come unpainted. The scale is 32mm which is the industry accepted gaming standard. Some assembly may be required. Of course there will be variation from miniature to miniature depending on posing and sculpter. Also the monsters will be larger in size standing up to 100mm in some cases. These are high quality, hand sculpted metal miniatures worthy of any tabletop.
So here is your opportunity to support us in this great Call of Cthulhu adventure.
 
 **All Miniatures are unpainted white metal 32mm scale miniatures.

R'yleh Disk Shards are only available to sponsers through our Indiegogo Program. Add $10, $15 or $25 to the perk of your choice to get these limited edition miniature disk shards.

 Who we Are
This great project actually started decades ago and there is a talented team driven by a shared dream behind it. Our story begins over 37 years ago, when RAFM Company Inc, began producing rules and then miniatures for the gaming industry in 1979. RAFM Call of Cthulhu miniatures has probably been our most successful line. Envisioned and sculpted by Bob Murch for the Call of Cthulhu RPG by Chaosium Inc. the figures have transcended the industry and been reissued by many companies. None compare with the lasting tradition of the line. 
This company, reborn in 1999 as Silver Fox Productions Inc., producing RAFM Miniatures, has a proven track record. Our miniatures have sold to thousands of people worldwide, and have received many awards  from the game industry. Other award winning lines include Siege Equipement, and WWII Vehicles. Our new lines include USX Modern Day Heroes, and the upcoming Airship Pirates Miniatures. The company has existed for several decades and will be around to support your gaming needs for years to come. All miniatures are produced for Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu Role-playing Game and continue to be an official licensed product for the Call of Cthulhu Role-playing Game TM.
Why is Shipping and Handling Internationally so High?
Eighty five white metal miniatures are very heavy for shipping purposes. They will mass about 2 Kilograms, we've checked international shipping and it costs over $25 to $30 to ship to Europe and abroad, not adding for shipping materials. This is hard to do. We are doing everything we can to get these products to Call of CthulhuTM players from around the world. We are grateful for your understanding.

<br/>Forgotten is a horror game influenced heavily by the likes of Amnesia, Silent Hill, and Dark Souls. We're talking about a game that you will personally attach yourself to: you will be proud of how you play, of the progress you've made. You will be terrified when something stands in your way. You will be in awe at what you see and what you experience. You'll wake up, play this game, and then go to sleep with it in your dreams... or nightmares. <br/><br/>Forgotten applies advanced psychology to every moment in the game to make sure it has an incredible emotional impact on you. You'll appreciate it as a game, as an experience, and as a piece of art.<br/><br/>Sounds like the kind of game you'd like to play, right?<br/><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Long Version<br/>
</h3> <p>I'm 19 years old and have been interested in videogames for as long as I've been able to play them. From Zombies Ate My Neighbors on the SNES all the way up to my current favorite: Dark Souls II. My favorite kind of game is and always has been the kind that uses psychology and an incredible presentation to make the experience emotional, personal, and unforgettable. <br/><br/>About a year ago, I started on Forgotten, a game in the vain of those I love. I took a little bit of Amnesia, a bit of Dark Souls, a bit of Journey, a whole lot of Silent Hill, and miniscules amounts from pretty much every game and game designer that I've ever loved. I wrote down a design document that's since been revised some thousands of times and eventually made the first playable version of this game and put it on GameJolt. I did this as sort of a hobby thing. <br/><br/>When my game reached well over 10,000 plays and I started drowning in positive comments and reviews for it, I started developing it more seriously. I now work with a few freelance artists on Forgotten for at least a couple hours each day. I truly think this game has the potential to be big: to reach hundreds of thousands of people, and to be loved  by just as many.</p>
<p>I love Forgotten, but it can NOT be the way I envision it without some help.</p>
<p>If you can contribute even $1 to help us with the issues listed below, your contribution could make all the difference in the quality of Forgotten.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3> <p>Let me be clear: Forgotten is not a solo endeavor. I work with some very, very talented freelance artists who sacrifice their time and their sweat to create professional quality assets for Forgotten. The game would seriously not even be where it's at now without them. Here's two big issues related to this:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Even with the current team, we're not able to finish a game like Forgotten in a timely manner. We need more artists, and artists are NOT free. Plus, I'm sure you'd agree that the current team deserves compensation for their hard work, wouldn't you?<br/>
</li> <li>Software: Dynamic shadows, photo-realistic lighting, great performance on even low-end machines, and living, breathing enemies that will make you jump and squirm all sound nice, don't they? The tools to do all of this aren't free. In fact, the licenses are expensive and they simply will NOT happen without your contribution.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think about it, a total goal of $5000 is extremely reasonable. We aren't asking you to buy us computers (I use a $300 laptop and I can personally assure you it is MORE than fast enough to handle almost everything you throw at it) and we aren't asking you to  pay or marketing or anything unrelated to the production of this game. In fact, your contribution will pay for nothing more than our software licenses and resources. --and trust me, it will make ALL the difference.<br/></p>Forgotten WILL be released regardless of funding. Here's what different levels of funding will do for Forgotten:<br/><br/>- $1500: If we can get at least $1500 in contributions, Forgotten will be able to feature enhanced graphics effects, like dynamic shadows, focal blur, and photo-realistic lighting.<br/>- $2500: If we can get $2500 in contributions, Forgotten will feature SIGNIFICANTLY higher quality textures, voice-acting, and models.<br/>- $5000: If we can reach $5000 in contributions, Forgotten will have even better production values, a much higher attention to detail, and will be finished as much as half a year sooner.<br/>- $6000+: For every $1000 over the main goal, we can add in more and more levels to the game. The base game will be released with six levels, and the extra levels will be added via updates for free.<br/><br/>Of course, I don't expect you to help fund a project that doesn't directly benefit you. That just doesn't make sense. That's why contributing to Forgotten DOES benefit you. <br/><ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What You Get<br/>
</h3>If 1/4th of everyone who's enjoyed my demo contributed even $1 right now, I would reach my $5000 goal in one minute. But I understand it's hard to give money to something in which you don't get some kind of tangible reward for, so to help entice you, here are the perks we've prepared:<br/><b><br/></b><ul><li>
<b>$1 Doing What You Can:</b> You don't have to contribute a lot to help make this game a reality. In fact, if just 1/4th of the people who played Forgotten contributed only $1, I would have everything I needed to finish it up and make it great.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>$10 Early Purchaser:</b> Contributing $10 or more means that once the game is released, you'll receive a digital copy of it! What makes this really great is that you'll also be helping make the game a reality, <i>and </i>you'll be getting a $10 discount off of it's total retail price, which will be $20!</li>
<li>
<b>$20 Forgotten Enabler</b>: In contributing $20 or more, you've gone above and beyond the call of duty. On top of getting this game when it comes out, you're going to get a spot in the credits. Cool, huh?</li>
<li>
<b> $50 Alpha Tester:</b> If you really love Forgotten and you want to get to play this game before it's done, this is the perk for you. You'll get access to the game while it's in-development, a full copy of it once it's out, and your name in the credits!</li>
<li>
<b> $100 A Part of the Team:</b> This tier gives you not one, but two extra perks: On top of all the cool stuff above, you also get to be a part of the discussion boards where me and the freelance artists working on Forgotten plan things out.

<h2><strong>UPDATE!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Twisted Feary Tales will now be coming to selected Android Tablet devices in early 2013 shortly after it's iOS release. More info on the Android release in the coming weeks!</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Who We Are"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.theplayer.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/WhoWeAre.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>Hi there, I'm Paddy Murphy, Lead designer at Time Machine Games.</p>
<p>I'm an award winning Irish games developer, who previously co-founded Open Emotion Studios and had a hand in creating Mad Blocker, Ninjamurai &amp; Revoltin' Youth. I have set up Time Machine Games alongisde some of the most talented folks I've met in Irish Game Development circles and we're currently working away quite hard on our first title, Twiisted Feary Tales - RED.</p>
<p>The last/first time I set up a company I had the luxury of having savings to put into it at the beginning. I was able to get some equipment, some software and keep a roof over the team's head for about 2 months. In that time, we completed our first game Mad Blocker which would go on to receive over 3 million plays worldwide and spawn a PSP/PS3 sequel.</p>
<p>This time around things are a little different and to be able to create this beautiful and compelling game in the best possible way, we are looking to you, to give us a hand.</p>
<p>If you help us bring Twisted Feary Tales to fruition we believe we can craft one of the most beautiful, compelling puzzlers that the iPad has seen to date and set in place a platform to constantly deliver creative &amp; fun new expansions on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p><img alt=""RED Screenshot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A3kItcZCIAEFmhI.jpg:large"" src="""" style="""" title=""Twisted Feary Tales Screen 1""/></p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.theplayer.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/What-isTFT.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>Well, it's not like Limbo (watch the video) ... Although aesthetically it definitely borrows from that title. The game itself is an ongoing title which will deliver modern day retellings of classic fairy tales.</p>
<p>In traditional fairy tales the endings were not quite as pleasant as they have been portrayed by media such as Disney. We want to return these stories to their dark roots and look back to the very first versions to extract the core themes and messages which will shine through in our game.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, Twisted Feary Tales plays like a cross between Lemmings, Ghost Trick and Abes Oddysee. You must manipulate the environment to protect Red from enemies, the big bad wolf and various traps. There will be times where you will end up in a ""finger twister"" desperately scrambling to figure out what is the optimal hand shape to complete a section and gain that coveted 3 star rating.</p>
<p>Twisted Feary Tales is a long term commitment to us and we want to continue developing content for the game, for as long as players are interested.</p>

We have a bunch of equipment, software and licenses to purchase to complete the game. We can plug away on development as things are but by the end of our dev cycle we will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPads for testing during the development (Minimum of 3 needed, 6 would be ideal)</li>
<li>We need a full license for Unity Pro &amp; iOS which will set us back about $3,000</li>
<li>We will need an Apple developer license which is a paltry $99, but still worth noting.</li>
<li>We will need to keep the roof over our heads for the next 2/3 months to complete development of this title as well as pay the staff involved enough to keep them on this project full time.</li>

</div></div>","Click Magazine: ""Paddy himself has previously spearheaded work on highly feted titles like Mad Blocker and Ninjamurai at Open Emotion Studios and looks set to make a big splash with his new endeavour.""
UPDATE!
Twisted Feary Tales will now be coming to selected Android Tablet devices in early 2013 shortly after it's iOS release. More info on the Android release in the coming weeks!
Hi there, I'm Paddy Murphy, Lead designer at Time Machine Games.
I'm an award winning Irish games developer, who previously co-founded Open Emotion Studios and had a hand in creating Mad Blocker, Ninjamurai & Revoltin' Youth. I have set up Time Machine Games alongisde some of the most talented folks I've met in Irish Game Development circles and we're currently working away quite hard on our first title, Twiisted Feary Tales - RED.
The last/first time I set up a company I had the luxury of having savings to put into it at the beginning. I was able to get some equipment, some software and keep a roof over the team's head for about 2 months. In that time, we completed our first game Mad Blocker which would go on to receive over 3 million plays worldwide and spawn a PSP/PS3 sequel.
This time around things are a little different and to be able to create this beautiful and compelling game in the best possible way, we are looking to you, to give us a hand.
If you help us bring Twisted Feary Tales to fruition we believe we can craft one of the most beautiful, compelling puzzlers that the iPad has seen to date and set in place a platform to constantly deliver creative & fun new expansions on a quarterly basis.

 
Well, it's not like Limbo (watch the video) ... Although aesthetically it definitely borrows from that title. The game itself is an ongoing title which will deliver modern day retellings of classic fairy tales.
In traditional fairy tales the endings were not quite as pleasant as they have been portrayed by media such as Disney. We want to return these stories to their dark roots and look back to the very first versions to extract the core themes and messages which will shine through in our game.
In terms of gameplay, Twisted Feary Tales plays like a cross between Lemmings, Ghost Trick and Abes Oddysee. You must manipulate the environment to protect Red from enemies, the big bad wolf and various traps. There will be times where you will end up in a ""finger twister"" desperately scrambling to figure out what is the optimal hand shape to complete a section and gain that coveted 3 star rating.
Twisted Feary Tales is a long term commitment to us and we want to continue developing content for the game, for as long as players are interested.



 
So, why do we need $20,000 dollars. We have a bunch of equipment, software and licenses to purchase to complete the game. We can plug away on development as things are but by the end of our dev cycle we will need:

iPads for testing during the development (Minimum of 3 needed, 6 would be ideal)
We need a full license for Unity Pro & iOS which will set us back about $3,000
We will need an Apple developer license which is a paltry $99, but still worth noting.
We will need to keep the roof over our heads for the next 2/3 months to complete development of this title as well as pay the staff involved enough to keep them on this project full time.

 


 
We feel that there is a niche for games that exploit Apples Multi-Touch input and that Twisted Feary Tales could be the game that brings this to the fore. Help us make this game and you could be part of changing the way game design is considered on multi-touch devices. Forever.

Between everyone involved we have created over a dozen successful games across PC, iOS, PS3/PSP and Xbox Indie Games. We know we can deliver on our promise of making a kick-ass puzzler which gives a new lease of life to your iPad.


 
Even if you can't directly contribute, you'd be doing us an amazing service even by sharing, tweeting or generally talking about our campaign!
Thanks for your time and stay tuned for more updates as the game develops, such as stretch goals, more platforms and loads of other exciting bits of news!!!
We hope you join us on this journey and thank you for taking the time to check Twisted Feary Tales out.
All the best,

governments and their greedy policies. But by the time it reached its 
peak, any kind of order had already been swept away from the face of the
 earth. Then, a series of cannibal wars exploded and changed the rules 
of evolution forever, turning the biggest part of humanity to hordes of 
hungry zombies.<br/> But even the zombies were proven harmless against a new 
race of proud warriors emerged from all that chaos. Raised in a small 
archipelago from the ashes of civilization, they rose and created a 
brotherhood of road knights, based on the ancient feudal law but riding 
huge hot rods instead of war horses and fighting with deadly 
machine-guns instead of swords and axes. Thousands of miles of abandoned
 highways are now their kingdom, and zombies are on the brink of 
extinction, to the point that their cut-off ears are valuable and used 
as common currency.<br/> But trouble didn’t finish there. All across this 
world of fast cars and frantic action, dark, fanatic cults began to 
grow, hidden in the abandoned residential areas,recruiting soldiers 
from the starving population and giving them weapons and vehicles to 
create a lethal army of desperados. <br/>Being someone here, where life is 
worth less than a zombie ear, will depend on your guts, on the killings 
you manage to mark on the butt of your gun and on your skill at the 
wheel.<br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/612866/files/20140529145222-pruebasRender_28.jpg?1401400342"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/612877/files/20140529145442-pruebasPueblo_10.jpg?1401400482"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><p style=""background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 15px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/612502/files/20140529122722-features.png?1401391642"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>-Battle vehicles mmrpg.<br/><br/>-8 types of battle vehicles with 3 different classes per type.<br/><br/>-5 game modes.<br/><br/>-Balanced game system, giving priority to skills over levels.<br/><br/>-Play from your browser, no installation, no long downloads.<br/><br/>-New political system.<br/><br/>-Hundreds of weapons and items.<br/><br/>-Extensive customization of your vehicle.<br/><br/>-Continuous terrain maps.</b><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/612878/files/20140529145507-pruebasRender_15.jpg?1401400507"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><p style=""background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 15px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/612503/files/20140529122729-theGame.png?1401391649"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

At the moment, we haven´t made any delivered commitments and we don´t want to fail in our promises.The results aren´t satisfying and, without money we can´t accomplish the objetives within a reasonable time.We've spent a lot of time and effort on this campaign, the objective was to cover accommodation costs and basic overheads and fully dedicate our time to the project development. But, without funds... we need to spend our time on more effective tasks.The project goes ahead, but the pace of development is uncertain. I press, we need to eat!If you are interested in the game, you can follow its developmental at http://www.damnbarbie.com, also you can contact us at damnvix@damnbarbie.com or perales@damnbarbie.com.Anyway, we will here until the end of campaign and any economic contribution will be a great help to us.

governments and their greedy policies. But by the time it reached its 
peak, any kind of order had already been swept away from the face of the
 earth. Then, a series of cannibal wars exploded and changed the rules 
of evolution forever, turning the biggest part of humanity to hordes of 
hungry zombies. But even the zombies were proven harmless against a new 
race of proud warriors emerged from all that chaos. Raised in a small 
archipelago from the ashes of civilization, they rose and created a 
brotherhood of road knights, based on the ancient feudal law but riding 
huge hot rods instead of war horses and fighting with deadly 
machine-guns instead of swords and axes. Thousands of miles of abandoned
 highways are now their kingdom, and zombies are on the brink of 
extinction, to the point that their cut-off ears are valuable and used 
as common currency. But trouble didn’t finish there. All across this 
world of fast cars and frantic action, dark, fanatic cults began to 
grow, hidden in the abandoned residential areas,recruiting soldiers 
from the starving population and giving them weapons and vehicles to 
create a lethal army of desperados. Being someone here, where life is 
worth less than a zombie ear, will depend on your guts, on the killings 
you manage to mark on the butt of your gun and on your skill at the 
wheel.-Battle vehicles mmrpg.-8 types of battle vehicles with 3 different classes per type.-5 game modes.-Balanced game system, giving priority to skills over levels.-Play from your browser, no installation, no long downloads.-New political system.-Hundreds of weapons and items.-Extensive customization of your vehicle.-Continuous terrain maps.
Damn cars! is a massive multiplayer online RPG. Set in a dystopian future  world full of zombies. This game is
based in the real-time races and battles
Take your place in a car with a super charged engine and weapons everywhere, face races, battles and achieve your
goals. Driving to Glory!The game has 5 game modes, all in real-time
multiplayer:
Races: classic races, you can shoot, spin,
explode, pinch ... and run as fast as you can to victory.
Arena: clashes, where the only thing matters is to survive and destroy all your contenders, including ""capturing the flag"",
team battles and many other excuses to destroy your enemies.
Conquer: invade or defend fortified territories
for the glory of your tribe ... or just for money.
Pillage: break into ""The Instances""and try to
loot and survive to tell the tale.
Instance: the perfect combination between a
classic RPG dungeon and car-battle game. Take on these challenges
together with your friends.Damn Cars! has huge scenarios full of game play
elements, automatic weapons, switches, different kinds of doors,ramps, bonuses ... besides objects and weapons to collect and trade. Adjust the difficulty of the scenes in relation to the level of the contents. The priority is the ability rather than the level.
Originally we had eight different vehicles
and three classes for each. The cars are different from each other with
their own weapons and skills.
-""Yellow jacket"": Super fast car specialized in
infiltration.
-""Trashhopper"": The king of cross country, always
looking for you in the
sight  of  his mortar.
-""Saber"": Fast, easy driving and extreme fire-power, ""Battle Gran Turismo"".
-""Tarasca"": A battering ram fed on fuel and human
bones.
-""Mule"": Repairs specialist of the Armageddon.
-""Salamander"": This modern and technological car will make the others think you're a wizard.-""Boar"":a piece of mobile artillery designed to hunt humans.-""Kamazu"": Big, strong and armored , tanks would be perfect if they were not so slow.As a multiplayer game, Damn Cars! apart from the classic options like create tribe and trade with them, you can choose to survive on your own as a mercenary or join any of the different sects
of the game, they will give you power in exchange for your services
and pay them bills.

We are a development team of two guys with  programming experience and we decided to create a game with new ideas and technologies.Our first project, Damn Cars! (we hope the
first of many) we decided to choose the  WEBGL/GSGL
instead of the conventional engine  just because it's  easy
accessibility and integration of the different platforms for all our
users.
We want this project to be the first of a long
list of tool games and libraries created for it.
Right now we're dedicating our time completely to the project and need your support to:-Amplification and contracting new servers.-Renewing equipment in order to accelerate  the design process and  3D rendering process.-Software licenses.-Accommodation and cost for the team.-Fees and taxes.The end of August we're launching a mini/demo version of Damn Cars! In which you can try out for your self part of the characteristics of this project .Stay alert for updates.

<br/><h4>The studio
</h4>
<p>We are a group of highly-skilled IT programmers, graphic designers 
and architects able to lead teams in big companies and provide best 
solutions to every project - but that's during office hours. At home we 
are a bunch of hardcore gamers playing almost everything that reacts to 
mouse, keyboard or pads. 
Now, united under Space Boat Studios we would like to present you <b>Out of reach</b>
 - the project that we are completely devoted to since the beginning of 
2014 and which has the potential to provide everything that other 
similar productions can't!</p>

<h4>The game<br/>
</h4>
<p>As gamers like you, we want to pay once and enjoy a game for as long as possible. That's why every idea we come up with is set to prolong the experience and avoid monotony. Here are the main points that describe our project best: <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/822619/files/20140830082316-mmo_header.png?1409412196"" src="""" style=""""/></p>No AI or storyline can replace competing or cooperating with other real-life players so we want to create a constantly changing, varied environment available for dozens of gamers playing together in the same place at the same time.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/824056/files/20140831035347-OutOfReach_multiplayer.jpg?1409482427"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>As we establish connection between players through our servers, we put our main emphasis to protect them against cheaters and abusers that already ruined several of really promising titles. As we keep full control of the game and constantly upgrade the code, you can be sure to start your journey at the same point as others and have the same chances to rule the islands as all survivors! <br/> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/822605/files/20140830080755-openworld_sandbox_header.png?1409411275"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Freedom of choices and lack of obstacles is what makes MMO-games great. In <b>Out of reach</b> you begin the journey as a castaway on one of the archipelago's island with worn-out shorts and sand in mouth - the rest is up to you. Apart from surviving in the wild you will need to explore the land of plains, deserts, caves and rainforests looking for food, shelter and fire. Decide whether to stay, build a home and make nature your servant or try to escape by boat to other, more friendly islands with different weather and environmental conditions. </p>

<p><b>Items and windows</b></p>
<p>One of several functions that we wanted to include from the very beginning was a nice and neat-looking, intuitive character interface, which would be just cool to use. Variety of items of different size and usage, real-life view of characters wearing every sort of armour, player statistics determined by gear - these are the things that we love to see in games since the first RPGs and these are the things that are already implemented in <b>Out of reach</b>.  <br/></p>

<ol></ol>
<p><b>Crafting, Upgrading, Salvaging in different workshops</b></p>Another big part of the character customisation and search for builds that suit players needs best are crafting and upgrading facilities. Basically every part of equipment must be firstly crafted to be then upgraded in different ways in order to improve its stats. To do so, players will have to find or build a proper workshop, which could be used only with the right ingredients and resources. All these actions make the road to obtain the best gear really bumpy but very satisfying at the end.  <br/><br/><p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/822751/files/20140830095045-achievements_header.png?1409417445"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If that's not enough, we currently make efforts to develop an achievement system to make gameplay even more rewarding and diverse. It's going to be fully based on the actions undertaken by the player. How good of a lumberjack, miner, hunter or assassin you are, depends only on the amount of personal devotion you commit to the task. Developing a character in specific areas allows players to use new skills - both active like 'charge' (that can completely change the style of fighting) and passive like 'trapper' which greatly improves the way one moves in the wild. <br/></p>

Having gathered necessary resources such as wood, stone or flax you become able to build in just a few clicks a small shelter with bonfire for the night or a great, multi-storey stronghold along with defensive structures, a variety of workshops and separate rooms for your group. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/823151/files/20140830132848-outofreach_build.gif?1409430528"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/823443/files/20140830164441-building.jpg?1409442281"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Trying to put up with wild animals in changing environment, constantly 
looking for supplies and a better place to stay overnight is already 
hard. Doing so with other castaways in the neighbourhood is even harder.
 Making bad decisions and enemies can result in being hunted down even 
behind thick walls. <br/>A five-level stronghold with bay windows, watch 
towers and double gates are great against scavengers and barbarians but 
what about war machines? <br/><br/><p></p>

<br/>In <b>Out of reach</b> we give you an opportunity to construct 
fully-interactive and upgradable siege engines such as trebuchets, 
ballistae, battering rams or siege towers! Every single part of such

properly, drawn and fired. <br/>Being combined with melee and range

<h3>Development stage</h3>
<p>While typing these words, we are already doing some serious load tests on our home-based servers. Friends who agreed to be our testers are checking how every feature of the game works, homepage and changelog are being constantly updated and our team devotes yet another evening and weekend to make <b>Out of reach</b> alive. <br/></p>
<p>A proper name of our currently developed built is probably ""Pre-Alpha"", but since we've all seen dozens of ""early-access-pre-alpha"" games on Steam that never made it even to ""pre-beta"" we are far from naming our project that way. We treat our potential players seriously. That is why we came out with <b>Out of Reach</b>, when we were sure that our game is at such stage that it won't be a waste of time for the players to read this text. We have the same approach towards <b>Out of Reach</b> public release. It will happen once we are sure that our product is of a good quality and ensures a great gameplay for hundreds of hours.<br/></p>
<p>What you see in the first trailer and pitch video of this page is our Internal Release 1. Scenes are taken from real in-game footage and every feature of the game works exactly as shown above. Nevertheless, there's still a lot to do till our first Steam release and sadly in most cases that means spending money. Although the passion for <b>Out of reach</b> raises in us with every day, that's not enough to cover costs of new necessary software licences, work stations, servers and company's monthly payments.  Here is where you can step in, dear readers. If you feel like we do - that this game can provide a lot of fun for many days and months and you don't want to wait for it till the next summer, you are more than welcome to help us buy new computers, hire several great artists and pay grocery bills for those of us who can't afford quitting so called ""normal jobs"" to work full-time on <b>Out of reach</b>. <br/></p>

<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>Here is how we would like to distribute the money that we get thanks to your generous contribution. As you can see, the costs of renting the servers and purchasing  most important assets are the biggest chunks of the cake. In our situation, the complete network infrastructure capable of handling first players must be ready and tested before the release of the game. That's why the most of our initial goal money is going to be spent on solid equipment that won't let you (and us!) down. <br/></p>
<p>Prices of machines, licences and ""pro versions"" combined with their taxes are fixed and unchangeable, so the only place to look for savings is our office and remuneration. That's why we agreed to keep it at 15% which will be enough to speed up our production considerably and still keep financial assets to support the most important matter - game servers for everyone who contribute to our campaign.  </p>

<br/><p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>At current stage of development we've already overcome many obstacles on our road that give us power and optimism to face any other challenge. We've built a stable foundation for a multiplayer game that is ready to take it to the next level. <br/></p>
<h4>Quality assurance</h4>
<p>What we see now in the team is such a huge overload of ideas on how to extend <b>Out of Reach</b> that chasing after half of them would possibly absorb us too much to save any time for a quality assurance.  <br/></p>
<p>We know about it very well from our own experience and we've already started to take steps to mitigate this risk by establishing priorities for new features and grouping them into ""Internal Releases"". <br/></p>
<p>Before each ""Internal Release"" we focus 100% on the quality assurance until both our team and friends who test <b>Out of Reach</b> are convinced that we reached the goal. That's the time we start working on a new group of features and that's the way we maintain a decent pace and method of the project.

<h3>Other ways of helping<br/>
</h3>
<p>Although every licence, program and toll costs money nowadays, they don't guarantee success by themselves. Spreading a good word about our project would be, besides contributing on Indiegogo, the best way to help us achieve our goal of making a big game to play for months!  A small yet great community that we have now, already encouraged us to push <b>Out of Reach</b> forward to the points we've never thought of before. We can only imagine what your feedback, comments or sharing could do. <br/>If you like the idea of the game we presented, please visit our <a href=""http://oorgame.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Website</a> to tell us about it, share our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/oorgame"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> page with your friends or vote for us on Steam Greenlight! </p>

<h2>
FAQ</h2>
<br/><p><b>1. What distinguishes Out of Reach from other survival projects?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In Out of Reach, you will develop your equipment step by step by the evolution from the stone age, through the bronze age and so on until medieval (at this moment we are beginning works on the bronze age, but as you could see in the trailer we already have some advanced siege weapons).</li>
<li>Players that will be on a higher progress level will move to other islands chasing for resources required for further development. This will increase new players chances to survive (we have also ideas how to discourage players from returning to the first island - we will describe this feature when we start working on it).</li>
<li>Fight for the fortresses with siege weapons and burning them to the ground.</li>
<li>We are focused on the close combat. We do not plan to add guns.</li>
</ul>
<br/><p><b>2. When do you plan to release it and what about Early – access?</b></p>We work hard every night and weekend to make Out of Reach a great product to play for months. What we can say now is that it will come when it’s ready. To push it forward, we can only encourage you guys to contribute to our Indiegogo campaign – lack of funds for buying most necessary equipment and impossibility for some of us to quit so called “normal jobs” is currently our only obstacle.<br/>Like most of you, we are also not satisfied with Early – access games nowadays and we probably wouldn’t decide to do that with ours.<br/>We will do the release when it’s fully stable and playable with all the features and assets we are announcing. Then we will start to push it to the next levels by uploading great add-ons.<br/><br/><p><b>3. Can I join the team and be a part of the testers?</b></p>If you would like to help us test the game before it’s released you can join a group of testers after contributing to our Indiegogo campaign. We are preparing almost 1 hundred places for those who want to settle the archipelago first and point out what they want us to change.<br/>Letting every one of you test the not finished game would make us just one of “those” producers with infamous early – access editions.<br/><br/><p><b>4. Why Indiegogo?</b></p>The policy of making our first game great from the beginning forces us to ask generous contributors for help with purchasing most necessary assets and servers because of the limited funds we can gather on our own. But, since that’s the only disadvantage of being an indie producer we are sure our cooperation with community will turn into a great product!<br/><br/><p><b>5. Will we have the option to host our own server or pay a third party to host it?</b></p>We want to ensure our players the most favourable conditions. That's why we decided that the game will be available only on the dedicated servers that will be rented and maintained by us.<br/>Due to such an approach, we will be able to deeply analyse if and how players try to cheat. This is a first step for an implementation of improvements preventing from such activities.<br/><br/><p><b>6. What are you currently working on?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Trees optimisation - it will significantly improve fps taking into account their amount.</li>
<li>Extending the list of items from the stone age</li>
<li>Bronze age</li>
<li>Workshops (one for upgrading leather armors and another related to the bronze age)</li>
<li>Swimming (It doesn't sound like great feature but it is a step forward to add a water transport)</li>
<li>Burning of captured buildings (almost ready what is presented in the trailer)</li>
</ul>
<br/><p><b>7. How many gamers can play in each room on the Out of Reach server?</b></p>We did bandwidth and server cost estimations for 100 players in each room on the server. At this moment, this is the most probable number of players.<br/>We will increase the maximum number of players when we find out it's possible.<br/><br/><p><b>8. Is it full loot pvp, partial loot, or no loot?</b></p>Currently, we have implemented full loot pvp model. Due to the gameplay economical issues, the only one change that we consider is introduction of slight probability for each of equipped item that it will be damaged/destroyed with a character's death.<br/><br/><p><b>9. What game engine do you use?</b></p>We currently run on Unity 3D 4.5 and make ourselves ready for Unity 5 Pro which is already in functional Beta. Once it’s released, we will switch to it.<br/><br/><p><b>10. Other languages?</b></p>Yes, we definitively plan to do the translation to other most popular languages on Steam. Nonetheless when you get to know how to play Out of Reach you won’t have to read too much ;)<br/><h3></h3>
</div></div>","Hello and welcome to our campaign during which we raise funds to finish a game that has every feature necessary to fulfil dreams of a great open world, first-person perspective survival! 
They wrote about us








The studio

We are a group of highly-skilled IT programmers, graphic designers 
and architects able to lead teams in big companies and provide best 
solutions to every project - but that's during office hours. At home we 
are a bunch of hardcore gamers playing almost everything that reacts to 
mouse, keyboard or pads. 
Now, united under Space Boat Studios we would like to present you Out of reach
 - the project that we are completely devoted to since the beginning of 
2014 and which has the potential to provide everything that other 
similar productions can't!



The game

As gamers like you, we want to pay once and enjoy a game for as long as possible. That's why every idea we come up with is set to prolong the experience and avoid monotony. Here are the main points that describe our project best: 


No AI or storyline can replace competing or cooperating with other real-life players so we want to create a constantly changing, varied environment available for dozens of gamers playing together in the same place at the same time.
As we establish connection between players through our servers, we put our main emphasis to protect them against cheaters and abusers that already ruined several of really promising titles. As we keep full control of the game and constantly upgrade the code, you can be sure to start your journey at the same point as others and have the same chances to rule the islands as all survivors!  
Freedom of choices and lack of obstacles is what makes MMO-games great. In Out of reach you begin the journey as a castaway on one of the archipelago's island with worn-out shorts and sand in mouth - the rest is up to you. Apart from surviving in the wild you will need to explore the land of plains, deserts, caves and rainforests looking for food, shelter and fire. Decide whether to stay, build a home and make nature your servant or try to escape by boat to other, more friendly islands with different weather and environmental conditions. 




Items and windows
One of several functions that we wanted to include from the very beginning was a nice and neat-looking, intuitive character interface, which would be just cool to use. Variety of items of different size and usage, real-life view of characters wearing every sort of armour, player statistics determined by gear - these are the things that we love to see in games since the first RPGs and these are the things that are already implemented in Out of reach.  





Crafting, Upgrading, Salvaging in different workshopsAnother big part of the character customisation and search for builds that suit players needs best are crafting and upgrading facilities. Basically every part of equipment must be firstly crafted to be then upgraded in different ways in order to improve its stats. To do so, players will have to find or build a proper workshop, which could be used only with the right ingredients and resources. All these actions make the road to obtain the best gear really bumpy but very satisfying at the end.  

If that's not enough, we currently make efforts to develop an achievement system to make gameplay even more rewarding and diverse. It's going to be fully based on the actions undertaken by the player. How good of a lumberjack, miner, hunter or assassin you are, depends only on the amount of personal devotion you commit to the task. Developing a character in specific areas allows players to use new skills - both active like 'charge' (that can completely change the style of fighting) and passive like 'trapper' which greatly improves the way one moves in the wild. 





One of the most advanced features of Out of reach is our intuitive and easy to learn building system. Having gathered necessary resources such as wood, stone or flax you become able to build in just a few clicks a small shelter with bonfire for the night or a great, multi-storey stronghold along with defensive structures, a variety of workshops and separate rooms for your group. 

Trying to put up with wild animals in changing environment, constantly 
looking for supplies and a better place to stay overnight is already 
hard. Doing so with other castaways in the neighbourhood is even harder.
 Making bad decisions and enemies can result in being hunted down even 
behind thick walls. A five-level stronghold with bay windows, watch 
towers and double gates are great against scavengers and barbarians but 
what about war machines? 

In Out of reach we give you an opportunity to construct 
fully-interactive and upgradable siege engines such as trebuchets, 
ballistae, battering rams or siege towers! Every single part of such 
constructions must be firstly put together in a war zone, loaded, aimed 
properly, drawn and fired. Being combined with melee and range 
weapons, the ability to build structures with both defensive and 
offensive features makes every single battle a challenge and an 
event to remember!

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I think the biggest risk of getting a game off the ground is not finishing it in time and using funds too quickly. One of the things I learned in my internship and from working on game projects in school was scheduling. Creating milestones is essential when working with investors and employees. I am a well organized individual with experience in leading teams in game design. I believe with gant charts, time sheets and milestones I will be able to keep everyone on track to get this project done in a year's time. </p>
<p>This is my first major game. This is a risk for you as an investor. I understand that I'm not EA, Ubisoft, or Rockstar. I've never released a game on the market before. To be quite honest I feel like creating this funding project is like making a contract with all of you that I will deliver everything I have promised, which is kind of daunting! But I have worked on games in the past with my fellow students at UCF and my games designs have always been in the top 5. I know that I have what it takes to be a great designer in the industry, all I need is for someone to believe in me and my ideas. I am asking you to take a chance, a risk, on me. </p>

If we go above the $1000 dollar goal I will make it my life's mission to complete the best quality game in the shortest amount of time to give you the most bang for your buck. I will be able to have ALL the features that I have dreamed of for this game and make it available through steam or some other 1st party platform. With your help you can make the dreams of recent graduates a reality. 
  The Impact With your contribution, no matter how small, you are helping young people make their first mark in the world. You are allowing me to start a business that will hopefully branch off into a fully fledged indie studio. 

  Risks & Challenges I think the biggest risk of getting a game off the ground is not finishing it in time and using funds too quickly. One of the things I learned in my internship and from working on game projects in school was scheduling. Creating milestones is essential when working with investors and employees. I am a well organized individual with experience in leading teams in game design. I believe with gant charts, time sheets and milestones I will be able to keep everyone on track to get this project done in a year's time. 
This is my first major game. This is a risk for you as an investor. I understand that I'm not EA, Ubisoft, or Rockstar. I've never released a game on the market before. To be quite honest I feel like creating this funding project is like making a contract with all of you that I will deliver everything I have promised, which is kind of daunting! But I have worked on games in the past with my fellow students at UCF and my games designs have always been in the top 5. I know that I have what it takes to be a great designer in the industry, all I need is for someone to believe in me and my ideas. I am asking you to take a chance, a risk, on me. 

  Other Ways You Can Help If you are strapped for cash, but think my idea is a pretty good one then you can still help! The word of mouth is immensely valuable! Please share on Facebook, Twitter, Imgur(my personal favorite), reddit, tumblr, anything you think would make a difference, even 9gag ;).",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
