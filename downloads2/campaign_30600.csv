<h4>This is Vincent Smith and you may recognize me from college football at Michigan.  After graduating, some of my team mates and I wanted to something meaningful with our education and opportunities from football.  So we created #EATING as a way to give back.</h4>
<h4>#EATING is our informatics project that uses technology to connect communities from resources. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our first major project is creating local gardening programs for our cities in Florida where we are from and cities in Michigan where we ended up.</span>
</h4>
<div><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><h4>#EATING gardens are excellent sources of nutritious foods for communities that lack access to fresh vegetables. Our goal is to grow food, feed people, and sell produce at local famers markets. Installing community gardens in urban areas provides job training, nutritious food, activities for youth, and opportunities for sustainable economic growth.</h4>

<h4>
</h4><h4>We decided to start with community gardens because we were so inspired by the great gardening projects that are in Detroit and also by the Farmers Market in Ann Arbor.  Football gave us the chance to start something great and that is what we are doing with #EATING.</h4>
<h4>We started in Pahokee, Florida and are expanding with Denard into his hometown of Deerfield Beach, Florida.  We are also expanding into Michigan.</h4>
<h4>You can help us by sharing our story with a friend, wearing one of our shirts, donating, or volunteering your time.  If you look below you can see some of our shirts and more information about what we are doing. When you support our teams think about supporting our local communities too. <br/>

<p></p></div>","This is Vincent Smith and you may recognize me from college football at Michigan.  After graduating, some of my team mates and I wanted to something meaningful with our education and opportunities from football.  So we created #EATING as a way to give back.
#EATING is our informatics project that uses technology to connect communities from resources. Our first major project is creating local gardening programs for our cities in Florida where we are from and cities in Michigan where we ended up.

#EATING gardens are excellent sources of nutritious foods for communities that lack access to fresh vegetables. Our goal is to grow food, feed people, and sell produce at local famers markets. Installing community gardens in urban areas provides job training, nutritious food, activities for youth, and opportunities for sustainable economic growth.




We decided to start with community gardens because we were so inspired by the great gardening projects that are in Detroit and also by the Farmers Market in Ann Arbor.  Football gave us the chance to start something great and that is what we are doing with #EATING.
We started in Pahokee, Florida and are expanding with Denard into his hometown of Deerfield Beach, Florida.  We are also expanding into Michigan.
You can help us by sharing our story with a friend, wearing one of our shirts, donating, or volunteering your time.  If you look below you can see some of our shirts and more information about what we are doing. When you support our teams think about supporting our local communities too. 






OUR #EATING SHIRTS:

#EATING shirts are made with USA cotton and printed with eco-friendly water based inks. They wash up soft and likely will become one of your favorite shirts. 






MORE ABOUT OUR GARDENS:


Our #EATING project was possible in the first place because of the support of Michigan fans and Alumni and readers of reddit and football blogs like Maize and Goblue and Mgoblog.  
We started #EATING because we knew that we could make important positive changes and set a good example for the youth from our neighborhoods.  We also know from football that we need to use teamwork to be successful.  We were lucky to partner with Urban Greenworks of Miami, Florida.UGW runs select food security and gardening programs through out South East Florida. Roger Horne, MPH (also a Michigan Alumni) is mentoring us through the process of creating a community garden and training program.  We are learning how to build ties with farmers markets so that our gardens can be profitable and self-sustainable in the long runPahokee was once the ""Winter Vegetable Capital of the World"" and now there is a lack of local industry.  Presently, unemployment is greater than 30%.  There is an opportunity to rebuild the local economy through agriculture and farming.


FUNDING GOALS:Our minimum goal is $15,000 for funding for Pahokee, fl.+$15,000 -  #EATING Pahokee, Florida Basic FundingGoals include outreach and nutrition classes.+$30,000 - #EATING expansion into Denard's hometown of Deerfield Beach, Florida.+$45,000 - #EATING programing for Deerfield Beach, FloridaGoals include creating ties with regional farmers market and selling produce. Integration of elementary school and nutrition classes.  Integration of youth after-school activities. THANK YOU FOR READING   - TEAM EATING

<p><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>Life coaching?  What’s that? What will you do?</strong></p>
<p>You may be wondering, ""What is the difference between a coach and a
therapist?"" A therapist is able to take a
reflective look back on life to answer deep questions, but a coach partners with an individual to provide resources needed. While I think therapy is very important, I am more interested in meeting people
where they are at now, identifying gaps and connecting them with the resources
to be where they want to be.  I love life coaching because it is evidence
based practice using the best available knowledge available today! Theory and skills are integrated to a
holistic approach.  </p><p>Myers Briggs typology test is a personality test founded on over 80 years of scientific research conducted around the globe.  The simple, but accurate, questions shed light onto 16 different personality typologies.  MBTI assessment analyses how people gain their energy, how they process information, conduct decision making, and therefore act out lifestyle.  Personal information uncovered is useful in career planning, stress management, conflict management, leadership and team development. </p>
<p>My long term goal is to complete the life coach certification program,
Invite Change.  It is a yearlong program
out of Kirkland Washington. Upon
completion and mentoring, I will receive a certification from the International
Coaching Federation; which is the governing board for all coaching.  </p>
<p>A first practical step in this direction is to take the MBTI
certification course, which will apply credits towards the Invite
Change program. With this certification I will be able to administer and
consult others to a deeper discovering of their identity.  Specifically, there are three areas where I
am interested in offering this knowledge; personal, professional or spiritual development. I envision working within educational settings, doing one on one consulting, and partnering with nonprofit agencies working towards social justice.</p>
<p>My goal is to become financially sustainable through coaching and consulting. I am partnering my lifelong
love of learning with a holistic approach to helping others. Through
self-employment I will be able to spend more time with Ayden and actively
participate in his life now.  I will also
be equipped, and freed up to serve and love others in my city. I care deeply
about education, empowerment, freedom for the brokenhearted, family, love and
my God.  </p>
<p>I am now actively involved with Soma Tacoma, where I’ve been making
amazing connections and practical ways to serve and love others. I am getting connected to Network Tacoma, and
the work they do to assist people transitioning from homelessness.  The hope and services they offer are amazing!  Dope Church is also another organization in
Tacoma that is in the beginning stages of development and ministry.  The leaders have amazing aspirations of
rescuing and loving those trapped in forms of human trafficking. I’m hopeful
for the possibilities to work alongside these organizations. </p>
<p>I am excited and a little nervous about this journey, but I know deep
down that it is one I am supposed to take. 
I am most excited about the ability to give back to my community and to
celebrate the unique ways in which we are all formed and created. This knowledge is important in our
understanding of how to live our lives in response.  </p><p>I can’t wait to spend more time with Ayden

the first school in Mexico to be recognized by Khan Academy International

a leader in online learning for other schools in its region
an exciting place for kids to learn from the world's best teachers.
We want to share our success with Spanish speaking kids everywhere. The Impact
The
future is digital. Everybody knows it. Children without computer skills will
have no chance in the coming world economy. BBC News reported on May 20, 2014 that Mexico ranked 34th of 34 countries in math education. BBC NewsKids who live in poor countries
with low education budgets, like Mexico and most countries in Central and South
America, suffer the greatest risk of being left behind. These children face a
yawning digital divide between poverty and prosperity. Help build a bridge to
get them to the other side.

<p>As you may not already know, I am started a course in September to become a certified Pilates teacher.  I reached my initial goal last summer for the deposit, but I am continuing to pay for the course as I make it through each level.  I had to defer for a little while and have rejoined a larger and more cohesive group.  I will have my test at the end of this year, but I'm well on my way and already teaching clients to fulfill my apprenticeship hours, observing classes, and doing my own self practice!</p>
<p>As I had noted with this initial campaign - I’d love to share my love of exercise and newly found love of Pilates with others!  I am able to reopen this campaign to continue funding, so I figured...Why not!?</p>

As I had noted with this initial campaign - I’d love to share my love of exercise and newly found love of Pilates with others!  I am able to reopen this campaign to continue funding, so I figured...Why not!?
The program that I am taking combines classical Pilates with a modern holistic approach to movement-science using visualization and touch, including anatomical education and insights.  Classical Pilates is much more universal than other new-fangled strains which means that I will be able to use it anywhere.
Bottom line: I want to learn and I want to work with people in a positive, fun way!   What I Need & What You Get Break it down nah: 
The certification program is $4,675.  This includes all Workshops, Anatomy Courses, Studio Access, Certification Manual, Anatomy Books and Study Guide, and then the final exam fee. I will learn more about myself and the mind/body connection, which I have already begun by taking Pilates classes.  I would love to continue this path and then share my knowledge with others.
 The deposit for the program is $1,500 (GOAL MET!)  After that I will make payments prior to beginning each of the 5 levels of the program, which will be an additional $3,000, divided up.  The final exam fee is $175.  The total is $4,675.If I manage to raise even MORE than that, the money would go to continuing a journey in the fitness field (additional certification, personal training, workshops, etc.)

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are three undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA fortunate enough to have our work selected for the 10th Annual Hawaii International Conference on the Arts and Humanities. The conference runs from January 10th-13th in Waikiki and we can't wait, but we're worried about the costs. Pittsburgh is a long way away from Hawaii and flights and hotels are expensive-- in total, over $2000 a person. Carnegie Mellon is being generous where they can, but so far it isn't enough, so we're looking for other ways to raise money. Any little bit helps! And please, spread the word.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We all cried at the end of the King's Speech when King George VI made his powerful speech to help the people of England.  When I saw that movie, I said to myself. ""They nailed it.""  That is an accurate assesment of what it is like to stutter.  I am very fortunate to have overcome my stutter, but many more people out there haven't.  That's where we come in.</p>
<p>I've made it my mission to give back.  What truly motivates me is to help others make their dreams come true.  I'm so thrilled to be able to do something that I love.  With your help, I am going to be able to change lives.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am creating a project called : 30 Days to Fluency.  I want to help people who stutter achieve fluent speech.</p>
<p>I am a person who stutters who achieved fluency.  It took a long way to get there and it led me down lots of interesting paths in life so far.</p>
<p>I need funds raised here to help me achieve my dreams.</p>
<p>I will be writing my personal history of stuttering and what it took for me to achieve lasting fluency.</p>
<p>In addition to the book, I will be creating an audiobook with interviews of people who have helped me along the way.</p>
<p>I will also be creating a website to be used as a resource for people who stutter. Here they will be able to share their experiences with people who stutter.  </p>
<p>If I do not reach my inital goal of $4,000 then I will donate the proceeds to the NSA foundation to help them raise awarness and to help people who stutter find coaching and success in their lives.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate financially and I know many people can't (times are hard), then the next time you see a person who stutters or have a friend who stutters, have patience and let them finish their sentences.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>I’ve worked in finance and on Wall Street for years and I learned that when it comes to holding on to cash most people were idiots. All too often ‘a fool and his money are soon parted’ was all too prophetic. Usually it didn’t matter how smart they were in other areas, when it came to managing their money, they were lost. Here’s a perfect example, I had a client who was a doctor. He was a brilliant surgeon, and a really smart guy but he wondered why he was losing money every year. He showed me his portfolio that he thought was really well managed. He had 7 different accounts at 7 different brokers in an attempt to diversify and spread his investments around. I showed him that all 7 accounts were actually invested in the same 2 mutual funds and all he was doing was paying 7 times the account fees.</p>
<p>I don’t blame most people for not knowing how to best manage their money. Investing is tough. Unless you have an MBA, it’s hard to understand what a quarterly earnings statement is, or analyst estimates, management composition, and all the other things that go into understanding how investments and the stock market work and more importantly how to make it work for you. The last thing you want to do with your money is lose it, and investing in the stock market is terrifying water for the uneducated to tread.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the people who need an investment education the most are generally the ones who can’t afford it. They can’t afford to pay expensive brokers or go back to school, and so they tend to underperform the people who can. That’s not right.</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>I knew there had to be a better way to teach people how to invest. I figured any solution had to include 3 things.  First, it had to be completely risk free. If people thought they would lose money, they wouldn’t take risks at all. Second, I needed to relate investment principles to something everyone already understands so they could focus on the core principles not financial jibber jabber. While there are lots of available virtual stock market games all they do is let you play with fake money, they don’t teach you how to invest using something you already understand. And third, it had to be fun. Investment concepts take a while to sink in so if it was fun, people would come back over and over and over again, and those concepts would start to solidify.</p>
<p>So I created Sport Stocks. Sport Stocks is a free fantasy stock market that teaches people how to invest in the stock market using something almost everyone understands and at least has seen … sports teams. Sport Stocks uses professional and college sports like stocks in the stock market.</p>
<h3>Here’s how it works:</h3>
<p>You sign up for a free account. It is completely free, no money is exchanged at all and we don’t ask for a credit card. You get $100,000 of fantasy Sport Stocks cash to invest in your favorite teams. So instead of buying shares of Microsoft and Boeing in the real world, you buy fantasy shares in the Yankees and Lakers. The stocks trade in real time, every day, just like the real stock market. To encourage you to come back often and really let the concepts sink in we offer incentives in the form of prizes that we award monthly, quarterly, and annually to the top portfolios.</p>
<p>I love this method because almost everything that happens in the real world happens on Sport Stocks. We provide tons of information showing how what you do  on Sport Stocks would work in the real world. As you play the game you learn to take control of your financial future, learning how to manage a portfolio. The game is designed to be accessible to adults and kids, leading to a whole new generation of more financially knowledgeable, prepared, and proactive people.</p>
<h2>What We've Done So Far, and Why We Need Your Help!</h2>
<p>I knew you wouldn’t want to contribute to just a concept, so my team and I built a basic version of the game and put it online to reach as many people as we could as easily as possible. You can see it at <a href=""http://www.SportStocks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.SportStocks.com</a>. The foundation has been laid but there is so much more we need to do to get this out to the people who need it most. We decided to come to Indiegogo so we could run this project in a way that would benefit the users, not just the way that would make the most for investors. Your contribution would go towards expanding the game and the educational tools. For example, we want to produce really interactive and entertaining videos so that our users can better understand the concepts we’re trying to teach. Finally, we want to tour high schools and universities, working with kids and teachers on how we can best implement Sport Stocks into the curriculum to teach kids earlier, rather than later, and set them up for future financial success. </p>
<p>I’ve invested everything I have to get a basic platform out there. I need your help to finish developing the project to its full potential and into the hands of those who need it most. <em>To thank you for your contributions I’ve put together some fantastic rewards, so take a look and see how you can <strong>help us improve America!</strong></em></p>
<h2>Our Rewards!</h2>
<p><strong><em>Thanks so much for your generous contribution!</em> </strong>We know the poor economy has made is very tough to contribute to a campaign like this, and we want you to know we really appreciate it. On top of knowing you've done something great for the future of America, we've come up with some fantastic rewards for you. <strong>Indiegogo limits our space to tell you about each reward, so know that each higher donation also get ALL OF THE LOWER REWARDS AS WELL!</strong> So, if you donate $250, not only do you get the Sponsored League reward, but you also get the Sport Stocks Cash, <strong>PLUS</strong> the shirt <strong>PLUS</strong> the hat <strong>PLUS</strong> the public thank you, etc.</p></div>","Most people don’t have a clue what they are doing with their money.

Unfortunately, the people who need an investment education the most are generally the ones who can’t afford it. They can’t afford to pay expensive brokers or go back to school, and so they tend to underperform the people who can. That’s not right.
The Solution
I knew there had to be a better way to teach people how to invest. I figured any solution had to include 3 things.  First, it had to be completely risk free. If people thought they would lose money, they wouldn’t take risks at all. Second, I needed to relate investment principles to something everyone already understands so they could focus on the core principles not financial jibber jabber. While there are lots of available virtual stock market games all they do is let you play with fake money, they don’t teach you how to invest using something you already understand. And third, it had to be fun. Investment concepts take a while to sink in so if it was fun, people would come back over and over and over again, and those concepts would start to solidify.
So I created Sport Stocks. Sport Stocks is a free fantasy stock market that teaches people how to invest in the stock market using something almost everyone understands and at least has seen … sports teams. Sport Stocks uses professional and college sports like stocks in the stock market.
Here’s how it works:
You sign up for a free account. It is completely free, no money is exchanged at all and we don’t ask for a credit card. You get $100,000 of fantasy Sport Stocks cash to invest in your favorite teams. So instead of buying shares of Microsoft and Boeing in the real world, you buy fantasy shares in the Yankees and Lakers. The stocks trade in real time, every day, just like the real stock market. To encourage you to come back often and really let the concepts sink in we offer incentives in the form of prizes that we award monthly, quarterly, and annually to the top portfolios.
I love this method because almost everything that happens in the real world happens on Sport Stocks. We provide tons of information showing how what you do  on Sport Stocks would work in the real world. As you play the game you learn to take control of your financial future, learning how to manage a portfolio. The game is designed to be accessible to adults and kids, leading to a whole new generation of more financially knowledgeable, prepared, and proactive people.
What We've Done So Far, and Why We Need Your Help!
I knew you wouldn’t want to contribute to just a concept, so my team and I built a basic version of the game and put it online to reach as many people as we could as easily as possible. You can see it at www.SportStocks.com. The foundation has been laid but there is so much more we need to do to get this out to the people who need it most. We decided to come to Indiegogo so we could run this project in a way that would benefit the users, not just the way that would make the most for investors. Your contribution would go towards expanding the game and the educational tools. For example, we want to produce really interactive and entertaining videos so that our users can better understand the concepts we’re trying to teach. Finally, we want to tour high schools and universities, working with kids and teachers on how we can best implement Sport Stocks into the curriculum to teach kids earlier, rather than later, and set them up for future financial success. 
I’ve invested everything I have to get a basic platform out there. I need your help to finish developing the project to its full potential and into the hands of those who need it most. To thank you for your contributions I’ve put together some fantastic rewards, so take a look and see how you can help us improve America!
Our Rewards!
Thanks so much for your generous contribution! We know the poor economy has made is very tough to contribute to a campaign like this, and we want you to know we really appreciate it. On top of knowing you've done something great for the future of America, we've come up with some fantastic rewards for you. Indiegogo limits our space to tell you about each reward, so know that each higher donation also get ALL OF THE LOWER REWARDS AS WELL! So, if you donate $250, not only do you get the Sponsored League reward, but you also get the Sport Stocks Cash, PLUS the shirt PLUS the hat PLUS the public thank you, etc.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Ciao a tutti!  My name is Lizzie and I am currently a sophomore at Edmonds Community College in the Business program.  Since starting college in 2011, I have held a nearly full-time job and a 3.7 GPA, which includes making the Dean’s List four consecutive quarters, including summer quarter.</p>
<p>Vince Lombardi once said:  “The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary.”  My hard work and drive has brought me to an amazing opportunity this spring.  Next month I will be studying abroad in Florence, Italy for the duration of my spring term.  Alongside a dozen other Washington State Community College students, I will be taking a full course-load of Italian Life and Culture, Creative Writing, and Classic Italian Literature.  This opportunity means the world to me as I haven’t had the typical college experience; in Italy I will live in apartment-style housing with two to three roommates.  Also, I have never traveled outside of the United States, besides Canada, so this is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  Unfortunately with this kind of experience comes high cost.  My parents are helping as much as they can, and I save as much as possible, but even community college tuition is rising!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I’ve created this campaign to help pay for my home institution costs, in part.  Even though I'm studying abroad through AIFS, I still have to pay my spring quarter tuition directly to Edmonds Community College.  Spring quarter’s tuition is $1,300 and I am hoping to raise half.  Thus far, I have paid for the program fees and my airfare.  In consideration of your donation to my campaign, I have some great perks lined up.</p>
<p>Perks include a thank you email, a postcard, an email with a photo of me at a historical location in Florence, and an original writing piece, depending on your level of contribution.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By studying abroad I hope to gain more appreciation and knowledge about the world that otherwise can’t be experienced through textbooks or internet research.  I have never been outside of the United States, with the exception of Canada, so this would be a huge step for me culturally and intellectually.  I want to learn how others live day-to-day life and expand my world view.  I feel with study abroad, it will allow me to have a less-biased perspective toward other cultures and people.  I anticipate that I will also learn more about myself through this experience.  I expect that by immersing myself into another culture, my beliefs and values will strengthen, or even change, due to my experiences in Florence.    </p>

<h3>Why should I invest in my community?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Karen Chan, the founder of HART Project. I'm a registered nurse and artist who has a connection to working with vulnerable inner city kids--ie. ones from the Downtown Eastside in Vancouver, Canada. To paint a picture, the kids we work/play with live in a community where we have to pick up used syringes / condoms before they can do so. Could these kids be given opportunities and positive mentors so they can have a stronger start? <br/></p>

<ul><li><b>      Building Community / Empowering Kids to be healthy through ART</b></li></ul>
<ul><li>

</li></ul>
<p><b>Our goal is to register as a non-profit organization (NPO) in Canada &amp; continue to mentor vulnerable kids to be empowered by the arts to lead healthy lives.</b><br/></p>
<p>Registering as a NPO allow us to sustain growth, change and have a broader effect. We can apply for larger grants to run our pilot projects on a bigger scale-- from our test sites in Vancouver to across Canada. We like to think big!<br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there! I'm Daniel, an iOS and Web developer. I started coding aged around 8, and it has been the most empowering skill that I have ever learnt. I am personally almost fully self taught, although a few people have been a great help along the way.</p>
<p>I would love to put together a short 14 week course, to get people started in iOS development, and I could just put together a series of generic tutorial videos on YouTube, however, I don't feel that this offers a good way of <em>teaching</em> people to actually code their own projects.</p>
<p>What I'm proposing is a 1 - 2 hour video each week, explaining how to use 1 or 2 core librarys or system features, such as CoreAnimation, CoreGraphics, the Acceleromter and GPS. At the end of which, I will set a challenge to be completed that week, with a reasonably open scope, to create something using what you know so far.</p>
<p>Obviously, some people on the course will be complete beginners, so the first weeks course will feature the basics: Creating a new project, using storyboards, variables, methods and other language features, and I will provide my skype, phone and e-mail details to people on the course, to offer them help as needed.</p>
<p>If the project goes well, I hope to offer a limited number of scholarship places, to allow those who cannot afford to enter the course, or for younger people who do not have their own bank accounts. As well as to publically release the videos after the course has finished.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>To make the project happen to a high standard, I have some expenses to pay:</p>
<ul>
<li>A high quality microphone, I will be purchasing a Blue Snowball or Blue Yeti, depending on the success of the project, as they offer great sound quality, without being really expensive.</li>
<li>Vimeo Pro, I will be purchasing a year of vimeo pro, to offer high definition video content, without advertising or upload limits (as each video will probably be around 2 - 3 hours long)</li>
<li>Web based storage, I will also provide a downloadable version of each video in H.264 1080p, this takes up a lot of space and bandwidth.</li>
<li>iOS Provisioning profiles, I will set up as many users as possible with iOS provisioning profiles so they can test their applications on device. This will require me to take out a second iOS developer membership.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will allow many people to learn what is a truly fundamental skill in a modern world - programming, and open up access to high quality tutorials for iOS (as there are alot of development courses for the web and android, but not many for iOS)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute financially, sharing this project with your friends and family using the indiegogo share tools would be absolutely amazing, to help the project come alive.</p>

<h3>* Kallaloo Alternative Learning Experience</h3>
<p>The KALE* Project is a non-profit REM initiative, based in Maine and St. Croix, U.S.V.I., focused on enriching high school students educational experience through agricultural and cultural summer camp.  With a focus on food security and the health, as well as economic benefits, of growing and eating local foods, The KALE Project will empower students by working on leadership and team building skills. <br/><br/>The project needs this funding for 8 scholarships, or $13,200, for Caribbean youth, who will interact with their counterparts in Maine.  We also need airfare for each student, a few inexpensive digital cameras, a video camera, camping gear for special trips (tents and new sleeping bags), and the ability to begin funding local initiatives in the Caribbean.  Scholarships will be given to students from economically challenged families under the guidelines of the U.S.V.I. Department of Agriculture. </p>
<p>KALE began as a dream of Bonnie Davis, to foster interest in agriculture, food security and sustainability for Caribbean Youth.  As a freelance writer in Maine, she learned about the exciting local food movement.  Growing up on a family farm in New Jersey and moving to St. Croix, U.S.V.I. a pre teen, she knows the importance of fresh, local foods as well as the need for art and cultural exchange. </p>
<p>With the support of local youth programs, farmers, farmers' markets, local artists, and the Maine, U.S.V.I. and U.S. Departments of Agriculture as well as the Maine University Extension service, teens will learn the importance of farming, local food initiatives and cultural experiences. Island teens will pair with Maine teens to exchange ideas and learn about each other's culture.  In the future, Maine teens will also have the opportunity to visit the Caribbean for a true exchange program.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<p>The kick-off project will be a summer program for a limited (6-8) number of teenagers from the U.S.V.I. to come to for a 6-week summer program focused on agriculture, art and culture. </p>
<p>The program will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why farming is so important – no farms, no food</li>
<li>Why healthy food is a right, not a privilege</li>
<li>The importance of local foods</li>
<li>Leadership &amp; teamwork skills</li>
<li>Different farming practices, soil, composting, etc., through the Master Gardeners from the University of Maine Extension Service</li>
<li>How to store various foods – freeze, dry, can</li>
<li>Customer service &amp; marketing</li>
<li>Computer, math, writing skills &amp; their importance in agriculture</li>
<li>Involvement with the Mid-Maine International Film Festival</li>
<li>Art, theater, crafts &amp; meeting people of other cultures</li>
<li>African &amp; Native American Drumming</li>
<li>Creating free educational videos &amp; documentaries for Caribbean youth in developing nations, such as Haiti &amp; Jamaica</li>
<li>Field trips to local farms, farmer’s markets, museums, historical interests, Boston, and other surrounding areas</li>
<li>Camping, canoeing/kayaking, swimming, hiking in Maine</li>
</ul>
<p>Future projects will include support for agricultural projects such as school and community gardens.  KALE* plans to award grants and micro loans to assist island agricultural, educational and food related endeavors for people who would not otherwise be able to do so.</p>
<p>While KALE* is a non-profit, there is a sliding scale depending on economic need ($1,650.00 to $2,550.00) for the 6-week program, including room and board, traveling during the program, admissions, etc.  Students need roundtrip airfare and spending money.  Full scholarships are available for qualifying students.<br/><br/>KALE, since it is the first program year, also needs cameras, video equipment and camping gear.<br/><br/>Contributors will receive perks as well as the joy of having helped youth in Maine, the U.S. Virgin Islands and developing Caribbean nations.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>As the world economy struggles, the need for food security and independence grows.  KALE* hopes to help teens get excited about growing food by hands on experience.  Bonnie Davis has worked on the United Nations Millennium Campaign since 2005.  Through planning conferences on global poverty, she met Jan Schrock, the daughter of Dan West who founded Heifer International.  The KALE* Project asks participants to pass on their teachings to others as part of their involvement, much as Heifer asks participants to pass on the gift of a goat, heifer, etc. Jan Schrock lives in Maine.  She is a mentor to this project and plans to give a presentation during their program.</p>
<p>Not only will contributions assist programming for summer camp, but they will also help students create learning videos for teens in the developing Caribbean nations such as Haiti and Jamaica.  Kids teaching kids is an awesome way to learn.  KALE also hopes through culture and agriculture, the Caribbean islands will focus on trading with each other to help stabilize their economies.</p>

<p><span class=""notranlsate"">ACLA (a.k.a. ArtsCorpsLA) is a public art and land collective that focuses on transforming unused urban land into dynamic art parks with localized, community-directed programing. La Tierra de la Culebra was the first of these parks, established over 20 years ago by artist Tricia Ward and 35 youth volunteers in the neighborhood of Highland Park. While we continue our work with the visual arts, dance, landscape design, and academia as an example of community-directed public space, we are also engaged in the creation of our fifth art park, the Spiraling Orchard. </span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">Many of the young people who built our parks and learned these skills in our program come back and work with the next generation. </span>The majority of our staff, volunteers and board members are people who grew up in ACLA.</p>

<p><span class=""notranlsate"">The County of Los Angeles has offered to reward our efforts with a grant of $19,000.

ACLA (a.k.a. ArtsCorpsLA) is a public art and land collective that focuses on transforming unused urban land into dynamic art parks with localized, community-directed programing. La Tierra de la Culebra was the first of these parks, established over 20 years ago by artist Tricia Ward and 35 youth volunteers in the neighborhood of Highland Park. While we continue our work with the visual arts, dance, landscape design, and academia as an example of community-directed public space, we are also engaged in the creation of our fifth art park, the Spiraling Orchard. 
Many of the young people who built our parks and learned these skills in our program come back and work with the next generation. The majority of our staff, volunteers and board members are people who grew up in ACLA.
What We Need & What You Get 
The County of Los Angeles has offered to reward our efforts with a grant of $19,000. Our task is to raise a matching amount so that we can expand music and arts programming, create permaculture demonstration gardens, and further develop on-site internships for local youth. 
Donate now and claim one of the truly unique perks on the right side of this page. Over a span of twenty years we’ve been able to create a lot of amazing art and we would like to share some of it with you.
 

Tricia Ward-designed Spiraling Culebra screen prints.
  
Intriguing, hand poured, one-of-a-kind 4x4 iron and aluminum tiles that will beautifully accent any tile patio or staircase.

Have your name--or someone else's--engraved on a brick in our new ""John Maroney Pavilion"" at Spiraling Orchard Art Park.
These are gifts you’ll be proud to display simply because of their beauty, but through your support of ACLA you can be extra proud that your aesthetic taste will result in the continuation of teaching youth life skills through the arts. 
The Impact 
Our program works with young people to 
• Support their ability to think critically about themselves and the world around them 
• Develop leadership and life skills 
• Create greater autonomy and independence in their passage to adulthood 
• Increase locally focused civic engagement by community members of all ages 
• Create cleaner, healthier local environments 
We do this through 
• The visual arts 
• Music and performance 
• Project management 
Other Ways You Can Help 
Please spread the word about us to your family and friends who support art as a way of teaching young people valuable life skills.

<p>Aiming to promote conversations and discussions amongst young people of Vietnam, in the summer of 2008, a group of students in Hanoi and students studying overseas initiated the Vietnam Youth Forum project.</p>
<p>From its first days, the Vietnam Youth Forum has provided an off-campus, non-traditional classroom experience for young people. It has enabled them to discuss, share, learn, connect and generate fresh ideas and microscopic solutions for various issues of Vietnam. Activities and events are organized for and by young people aged between 16 and 22. Furthermore, the Forum offers workshop training to develop the skills of its participants so that they can carry out meaningful changes in their communities through their independent projects.</p>
<p>The Vietnam Youth Forum 2013 is the sixth annual forum of the VYF project which will take place this summer in Hanoi.  </p>
<p><strong>Our Goal</strong></p>
<p>The mission of the Vietnam Youth Forum includes</p>
<p>●   Provide the Vietnamese youth with background knowledge of social issues, raise their awareness of global environment and encourage them to learn and contribute to their communities</p>
<p>●   Create a link between guest speakers (usually experts and pioneers in different fields) and Vietnamese youth to assist the exchange and discussion of outstanding issues of the year.</p>
<p>●   Develop and enhance essential skills of leadership, organization, presentation, communication, and team-work.</p>
<p>●   Establish an environment where young people can express their ideas and opinions, as well as propose initiatives and solutions to current social problems</p>
<p>●   Encourage and nourish youth motivation and inspiration to carry out new projects directly benefiting the community</p>
<p>●   Forge a network of future leaders with a firm commitment to their communities</p>
<p>●   Promote VYF values, thus strengthening the link between VYF and Vietnamse youth</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Highlights of the program:</h2>
<p>- VYF is one of the first forums for youth and organized totally by youth, allowing young Vietnamese people to express their views and learn about issues of local, national, and global importance.</p>
<p>- VYF's candidates are all young Vietnamese people who are living in Vietnam or studying abroad. They are proactive and curious youth, who are interested in social issues and want to create changes in their communities.</p>
<p>- The content of the forum covers many fields and revolves around the Forum's main theme each year in order to provide an effective and focused approach to specific topics.</p>
<p>- VYF activities are organized with the consultancy of notable advisors and guest speakers such as: Mr. Duong Trung Quoc - Historian and Member of the National Assembly, Ms. Pham Chi Lan - Senior Economist, Mr. Tran Viet Duc - General Partner of IDG Ventures Vietnam, Dr. Nguyen Huu Ninh - Environmentalist...,</p>
<p>- The ultimate purpose of the forum is not only to discuss and share experiences, but also to inspire and enforce the post-Forum community projects. This is the purpose of the <strong>Inspiration for Action Day</strong>, which offers participants methods to a deeper understanding of personal preferences, tendencies, weaknesses and strengths.</p>

<h2><strong>                                LOTUS ELEMENT</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>17 years ago all of my blood vessels in a major organ collasped, nearly killed me. Because I was relatively young at the time, this experience inspired me to encourage youth to make smarter choices that can lead to healthier lifestyles. Today I am devoted to broadening children's knowledge of alternative health options that are geared towards helping them eat better and be more physically active. Ultimately, my goal is to help designate an alternative health youth coach in every home.</p>
<h3><strong>What is Lotus Element?</strong></h3>
<p>Lotus Element is a place where youth can converge to enhance both mentally and physically in the area of alternative health, with the goal of living a healthier lifestyle. By facilitating the 9 Pillars of Scientific Consciousness (Imagination, Contemplation, Meditation, Experimentation, Visualization, Observation, Concentration, Discrimination and Adoration) and providing alternative health education, research, energy exercises, going green experiments, currency respect, and mental health wellness strategies, Lotus Element will foster an equal opportunity for youth to fall in love with discovering the importance of pursuing a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<h3><strong>Why I Am Doing This?</strong></h3>
<p>My plight to instill healthy values into children stems from concerns I have with the lack of resources available to people who yearn for healthier lifestyles. After conducting extensive research, it has become clear to me that this slow economy restricts one's access to resources such as private schooling, summer vacations, supplements, books, organic foods, and post secondary education.</p>
<p>In light of this, I targeted a community that has little or no exposure to the alternative health knowledge that I have gained. Door to door I went asking mothers if they would allow me to teach their children “healthy habits” in my home. Eventually I met a woman named Sharon. I shared with Sharon my passion for healthy choices as well as ideas I am mulling that could lead to having a designated alternative health youth coach in every home. Sharon stated that she wanted something better for her children, an opportunity for them to do well in life.</p>
<p>I successfully convinced Sharon to allow me to teach her children “healthy habits,” which was a small labor of love compared to Sharon's loving courage to change the health, mindset and future of her children.</p>
<h3><strong>Your Impact</strong></h3>
<p>You could potentially help thousands of families that want something better for their children. Your generous donation will undoubtely help create a wealth of new opportunity for children to achieve healthy eating and lifestyle behaviors. As I looked in my rear view mirror at the glow on the faces of Sharon's children, watching the energy of their pointing fingers and their thinking caps shifting into high gear, I marveled at their exuberance and genuine desire to learn more about healthy eating. Your donation will change lifestyles as well as the lifestyles of countless other children, forever.</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>Lotus Element needs Smart Boards, program and project funding. As we facilitate our Currency Respect program to our children it is important to us to formulate a strategy that shows our children that thinking outside of the box is a financially freeing exercise that can prevent debt and poverty while simultaneously strenghtening the economy.  </p>

My ultimate goal is to become a music producer, and to write, record, and produce music for artists in the industry today. </p><p><br/></p><p>This coming Spring semester, I will be blessed with the opportunity to study abroad at the University of East London. The school was started in 1892, and hosts 28,000 students from 120 countries. This diversity in culture will allow me to be exposed to many different people and styles of music, and will help me grow as an artist. The school also just opened a new campus, University Square Stratford, which is home to 3 new state of the art performance studios and over £750,000 in brand new music recording equipment. </p><p><br/></p><p>Studying at UEL will provide me with access to high quality facilities to work and to hone my craft in. The school is situated in the music hub of the world, London, England, and that in itself will immerse me in a massively influential music community. Having this opportunity at this point in time in my development as an artist and music producer is crucial, and I will definitely gain insights and knowledge at UEL that I could not obtain at any other institution. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</span></p><p>Attending the school of course requires me to travel a long distance.

Music is my passion. I love to write and create songs that people can enjoy and relate to. At Columbia College Chicago, I am studying Audio Design and Production where I am learning how to turn acoustic and electronic sound into a professional quality recording. My ultimate goal is to become a music producer, and to write, record, and produce music for artists in the industry today. This coming Spring semester, I will be blessed with the opportunity to study abroad at the University of East London. The school was started in 1892, and hosts 28,000 students from 120 countries. This diversity in culture will allow me to be exposed to many different people and styles of music, and will help me grow as an artist. The school also just opened a new campus, University Square Stratford, which is home to 3 new state of the art performance studios and over £750,000 in brand new music recording equipment. Studying at UEL will provide me with access to high quality facilities to work and to hone my craft in. The school is situated in the music hub of the world, London, England, and that in itself will immerse me in a massively influential music community. Having this opportunity at this point in time in my development as an artist and music producer is crucial, and I will definitely gain insights and knowledge at UEL that I could not obtain at any other institution. What I Need & What You GetAttending the school of course requires me to travel a long distance. This is not a normal expense, and will require me to obtain a passport, visa, and round trip plane ticket. For this campaign, I am looking to offset the financial burden that those expenses will put on me, but I would like to provide my sponsors with unique services in return. My goal is to raise $2,000 to cover the costs of all the necessary expenses that this trip calls for. Any sponsorship amount will greatly help me in this experience!$5You will receive a personal ""thank you"" shout out on Facebook for your generous donation!$10I will be keeping a blog while I spend my semester abroad, and at this level you will receive the link to my blog so that you can keep up on my travels and experiences!$20During my stay in London, I will send you a postcard to update you on my experience abroad!*Note: If you choose this level you will receive the postcard, AND the link to my blog.$50At the sponsor level, you can choose any song that you like for me to perform a cover of on guitar or piano, and I will send you a video while I'm in London!*Note: At this level you will receive the cover video, AND the postcard, AND the link to my blog. $100Upon my return, I will cook you and your family a proper, authentic English meal! *Note: At this level you will receive the meal, AND the postcard AND link to my blog.$200For this sponsorship level, you can choose any topic, idea, person, place, thing, etc for me to write, record and fully produce a song about. I will put to use the knowledge and techniques that I have gained while attending Columbia, and I will create and engineer a high quality recording for your enjoyment. *Note: At this level you will receive the written and recorded song, AND a postcard, AND the link to my blog. (You do not have to choose any of those amounts if you do not wish to; any amount would be greatly appreciated!)The ImpactAs you know, music plays a very important role in many people's lives. It helps us manage stress, get through tough days, remember special moments, and brings happiness and joy into our lives. I would be very grateful for anyone's contribution to help me have this once in a lifetime experience, which will in turn play a huge role in my development as a songwriter and engineer and will allow me to bring more music to the world. Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you are not able to sponsor me and make a contribution, you can still help me out by sharing this campaign on your Facebook wall or Twitter feed! Everyone is in touch with a wide range of people, and I would benefit greatly from your social reach. Thank you so much for your time and consideration!-Daly O'BrienHere is a link to my SoundCloud where you can listen to songs that I have already written:https://soundcloud.com/dalyobrien",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Other cool stuff
Boomerangs, fresh cookies, tea with a working artist, and in-home music performances. Whether you want to get RAWKED, learn the secrets of boomerangs, connect with a real working artist, or have a private concert at your house - Secret Knowledge has you covered. 
  
All knowledge is secret, until you share it. 
I started Secret Knowledge to help Portland's working class artists & musicians gain the business, technical, and marketing skills they need to succeed; and to offer arts-engagement events for people who want culture to involve them. 
It's a two-pronged approach:

Help artists succeed. Give them the skills they need to make it here. 
Help creative audiences be more involved in culture. Give them access to real artistic insight & creative mentorship.

We're already rolling on this. 
Secret Knowledge started offering workshops for working class artists in February 2014. So far this year we've offered 12 workshops. With your support we'll be able to expand our workshops, produce videos, and start bringing concerts and arts events to creative audiences in 2015.
The power of regular folks, like you and me. 
The funds we raise through this Indiegogo campaign will allow Secret Knowledge to pay for staff, promote events, and to start producing instructional videos of our workshops - that means working artists in other places will start to benefit from the educational programing we're developing in Portland. 
We have a plan, and it involves you. 


Secret Knowledge has a detailed business plan, which you can download here. 
The plan is to start small, build our brand, and grow our audience. Then launch an annual Secret Knowledge conference. Turns out that's a sustainable model for the services we're providing. The best part is, we're gonna help a lot of people along the way. 
It all starts with this campaign. With your contribution to our kick-off. 
Invite your friends and family to join you in supporting Secret Knowledge. You could easily double or triple the impact of your contribution by doing this.",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

We are raising money to hold a two week bootcamp over the holidays for 25 female high school graduates (matric) to learn basic Javascript programming skills, gain exposure to the 
IT industry and mentors working in the field. They will use these skills to tackle local challenges and build a real site or app for a simulated client and pitch their solution.Girls
 who show the most promise will be invited to join codeX, a full-time 
apprenticeship program designed to train agile developers for South 
Africa and the continent. 
In
the program, they
will learn to build real sites and apps for real clients.
The
 program shows girls that IT is for women, that coding is fun, that it 
can be used for business and social impact and that it can be a great 
career path.
This Indiegogo campaign is a joint effort between codeX, Africa's developer apprenticehip program,  and Innovate South Africa, a NGO that provides a platform to ignite creative thinking, to nurture invention and encourage entrepreneurship among young people. Innovate SA's program, Code4CT, trains girls to code. We are joining forces because we need more girls in tech!





WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOWWe are trying to raise $7500 or R75000 to run a two-week bootcamp
program for 25 girls in January 2015. It covers our costs for trainers, equipment,
transport costs for the girls, and fees of this campaign. 
FOR THE FUTURE


It
doesn’t stop there…the next step is to raise funds for the girls who make it
through and get accepted to codex. All funds raised above that will go
scholarships for the top girls in the program to the full year-long codeX program
in 2015 (which costs $10,000 per coder).




THE IMPACT 
Innovate South African ran the Code4CT program earlier this year with 24 girls.  Here's what they said about the program:





By joining forces, Innovate South Africa's Code 4 CT program and CodeX are:

- Creating a pipeline to develop young female talent in the tech industry in South Africa and across the continent.
- Offering young women from disadvantaged backgrounds an opportunity to 
learn practical skills that are easily transferable to a job.
- Fostering a network of young women who will be leaders in tech in Africa.
- Supporting educational and employment opportunities in a country faced with more than 20% unemployment for young people.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

I graduated in June, 2014 with an average of 85%. I took the past year off to work and save for school as well as to find out what I wanted to do for post-secondary education and ultimately my career path. I've always liked the idea of helping people and making a difference, I started looking into social work, particularly a career as a parole officer as I have a big interest in law. I thought it was the best combination of social and law work, something that I could make a difference doing. I've been accepted into UNBSJ for the fall 2015 term and I've applied for scholarships and asked many local businesses if they offer any. I have yet to hear back from some, so I am turning to the internet, to you. I need $30,000 for my entire 4 year degree. That doesn't cover living expenses or the numerous textbooks or even the full amount of tuition costs but it is the rough amount that I will have to pay in order to get the education I need for the job I want.

With your help, and the generous support of the Ella Lyman Cabot Trust, we ran a pilot program of Campesino School from May to August 2014 with nine young people and a great team of sustainable agriculture technicians, students with humanities degrees from the city, and the people of the community of Los Naranjos! For four three-week sessions, these kids, most of whom had never left the mountains where they were born, crossed the country to the Agro-Ecological Center in Los Naranjos. During the sessions, they studied the theory and practice of sustainable agriculture in the mornings, took popular-education style  classes in the afternoons about history, social-political studies, and music, and spent the weekends visiting other sustainable agriculture centers and experiences here in El Salvador.</p><p><br/>Campesino School is an idea that was born out of the frustration over the lack of opportunities that Salvadoran young people face today. In rural areas like Morazán, where our students live, today’s teenagers and young adults have anywhere between a third and ninth grade education. Some have been able to access scholarships to complete high school or even university, with great personal, familial, and communal sacrifice. When they graduate, however, the few job opportunities that exist keep them in the cities, far from their communities. It means that young people are leaving rural Morazán en masse in search of jobs or any kind of future, and many communities are losing their up-and-coming generation. It also means that the farming practices that their families have used for generations to grow corn and beans are being lost, not only because of the influence of transnational agricultural corporations like Monsanto who came in after the war to introduce their products to the impoverished repopulated communities, but also because nobody can stick around to learn them. The land is exhausted, the water table is low, the gangs are circling, and the promise of $7 an hour washing dishes on the night shift in New Jersey is appealing.</p><p><br/>Last year, we were able to host the pilot year of Campesino School, described above, and we are ready to tweak the program to make it better and more effective. The most important change we need to make is to move the program out to Morazán. The long distance that the students had to travel to get to FUNDAHMER’s Agro-Ecological Center in Los Naranjos had a couple detrimental effects on the program. First, the distance made it difficult for us to help the students implement the techniques they learned at Campesino School back in Morazán because they were away from home for so long during the growing season. Second, for young women who were interested in participating in the School, the distance was prohibitive because their parents didn’t want them traveling so far. Finally, the goals of the Agro-Ecological Center and the kind of coastal climate, soil, and environmental challenges that they face are very different from the kind of family-oriented subsistence agriculture that the students do in Morazán. We want to move Campesino School out to Morazán and give the courses in monthly workshop format so that students can implement the techniques at home during the course, so that more women can participate, and so that what they learn at School applies directly to the climate, soil, and environmental challenges of their municipality.</p><p><br/>Our other goal is to use a bit of land available to us out in Morazán to build a demonstration parcel. For those of you who know the area, it’s right below the Padre Octavio Ortiz chapel in Agua Blanca, by the bus stop. It’s a central location in the region where FUNDAHMER does its work in the communities, and by having Campesino School there and by maintaining the land as a demonstration parcel using sustainable agriculture techniques, we hope to show-not-tell the positive effects of a long-term commitment to sustainable agriculture practices, both in terms of environmental recuperation and agricultural productivity. We eventually want it to be self-sustainable, producing enough marketable specialty crops (probably starting with cacao) to maintain a small staff and materials, but for now, we will need to rely largely on personal donations, collaboration with Salvadoran institutions, and international development funding.</p><p><br/>We are working on long-term financial support, but for now, we need to get started, and we need your help, once again. We want to invite students back to School in March 2016, and we’ve got a lot to do before then. This fundraising campaign will help support some goals we have for the second half of 2015, including:<br/></p><ul>

Veterans make up the largest % of the homeless population right here on our Houston streets.   In 2014 (Sept-Dec), Mission Possible served 76 veterans of which 53 are currently employed and 16 are furthering their education.     Risks & Challenges  The sooner the veterans can make the transition with all the proper tools, the less risk they face of becoming a statistic. Yet, not every veteran we serve will make the transition. Some will go through a couple jobs before landing in their career. Some will have to deal with PTSD issues before they are truly ready to make this transition. Career Gear Houston will stand beside those veterans and see them through, with your help.     Other Ways You Can Help

<p>The Chinese Exclusion Act was a federal law that prevented entry of Chinese to the U.S. and excluded legal Chinese immigrants from obtaining U.S. citizenship.

<p><span>We met while studying physics at UCLA. But neither of us entered school thinking we'd be scientists. Rachel arrived, trombone strapped to her back, set on a career in music. Elizabeth signed up to study English, hoping to side gig at the student newspaper. Curious about physics, we both enrolled in the same one-unit seminar on ""The Arrow of Time"" as freshmen.</span></p>
<p>A couple years and one backpacking trip to the Alps later, we found ourselves burning the midnight oil together in a particle physics lab. Now, we're both headed toward careers in science: Elizabeth applied to graduate school in engineering last fall; she’s still figuring out where she’s going to go. Rachel is researching materials science and solar energy at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and applying for her PhD next year. </p>
<p>On our trip, we hope to show the students that scientists aren’t all old white guys with calculators growing out of their beards, who spend 24/7 in underground labs and have been tinkering with circuits since preschool. We hope to demonstrate how creative science can be and how much it already impacts their day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>Seriously though,<b> diversity and engagement are two of the most pressing issues in science education</b>. We don’t think we can solve these problems (at least not yet!) but we hope this trip will spark conversations, inspire a few kids to become scientists, and create lasting resources for educators to use in their classrooms.</p>

<p>Biking across the country, we have three goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Teach classes</b> at 10 middle schools about physics, engineering and renewable energy. To do this, we need <b>the Sol Cycle</b> and a variety of lesson plans.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We are in the process of prototyping the Sol Cycle, a toy-sized bicycle that runs off a solar-powered motor. This is where the bulk of the campaign funds will go. Manufacturing and shipping are expensive -- per unit, about $60 to print and $10 more for the solar panel and motor -- and there will be additional costs for delivery and shipping to us on the road. We printed our first draft at the Sacramento Public Library, and are now working with <a href=""http://invent.citris-uc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CITRIS Invention Lab</a> at UC Berkeley. Membership there is a little costly, but their resources and expertise will help us turn the Sol Cycle from dream to reality.</p>
<p></p>

<br/>
</li>
<li><p>To design the lesson plans, we are talking with teachers and working with <a href=""http://www.crscience.org/volunteers/aboutbasis"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BASIS</a>, a science role model volunteering program run by Community Resources for Science in Berkeley, to ensure our plans for the Sol Cycle align with <a href=""http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Next Generation Science Standards</a> and are feasible and implementable. And before we leave, we will be teaching lessons in Berkeley middle school classrooms to get feedback.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Interview teachers</b> at each stop about their experiences and challenges, and celebrate their work in the classroom.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How did they get started? What kinds of lesson plans do kids find most engaging? Does the community they live in affect the way they teach certain subjects?</p></li>
<li><p>As of the beginning of this campaign, we have already interviewed three educators and have already been deeply inspired by their grit, ingenuity and love for their students. We can't wait to share them with you.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Curate these stories and lesson plans</b> in an online collection, freely available on our website <a href=""http://www.cycleforscience.org./"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cycleforscience.org</a> for anyone to use.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On our blog we'll be sharing video interviews and highlights from our trip, as well as other inspiring science education projects from across the globe.</p></li>
<li><p>Plus, we are going to release the digital files for the Sol Cycle, so anyone with access to a 3D printer can make their own.</p></li>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This campaign hinges around a three-month long bike trip. Many things could go wrong: we could get injured and have to stop or shorten our trip. We might have to start later than anticipated to wait out the snow melt. We will be training for the next two months to ensure we're in good shape for the road.</p>
<p>While all the educators we are in touch with so far (two in Sacramento, one in Idaho, two in New York) are excited about having us stop in their classrooms or at their summer programs, it's always possible other teachers will be less enthusiastic about our proposal and there's a small chance we wouldn't be able to find 10 classrooms to stop in.

<p>We are in the midst of prototyping the Sol Cycle. We are confident we can get it running and manufactured by the time we embark on our trip, but printing errors and shipping delays could potentially postpone the trip or classroom visits. To avoid this, we will carefully review and test as many iterations of our prototype as we can. Additionally, they are toys -- they will likely be dropped and flung around, and run the risk of breaking. We will be bringing spare kits with us in case this happens.

Hi, welcome!

 
Thanks so much for dropping by. We're Elizabeth and Rachel, and this spring and summer we're bicycling from San Francisco to New York City. 
As we pedal east, we plan to teach hands-on lessons at middle schools and summer programs using the Sol Cycle, a miniature, 3D-printable, solar-powered bicycle we are in the process of designing. We’ll also be profiling science educators about innovation in the classroom and curating science lesson plans to create a repository of accessible, engaging activities for parents, kids and teachers alike.Cycle for Science begins April 17 -- and we need your help.


Cycle for Science is endorsed by:



The North America Association for Environmental Education! Go check out their amazing work to bring the world to the classroom, and the classroom out into the world, at www.naaee.net.

Who are we, anyways?
 



We met while studying physics at UCLA. But neither of us entered school thinking we'd be scientists. Rachel arrived, trombone strapped to her back, set on a career in music. Elizabeth signed up to study English, hoping to side gig at the student newspaper. Curious about physics, we both enrolled in the same one-unit seminar on ""The Arrow of Time"" as freshmen.
A couple years and one backpacking trip to the Alps later, we found ourselves burning the midnight oil together in a particle physics lab. Now, we're both headed toward careers in science: Elizabeth applied to graduate school in engineering last fall; she’s still figuring out where she’s going to go. Rachel is researching materials science and solar energy at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and applying for her PhD next year. 
On our trip, we hope to show the students that scientists aren’t all old white guys with calculators growing out of their beards, who spend 24/7 in underground labs and have been tinkering with circuits since preschool. We hope to demonstrate how creative science can be and how much it already impacts their day-to-day lives.
Seriously though, diversity and engagement are two of the most pressing issues in science education. We don’t think we can solve these problems (at least not yet!) but we hope this trip will spark conversations, inspire a few kids to become scientists, and create lasting resources for educators to use in their classrooms.

Here's our plan
Biking across the country, we have three goals:


Teach classes at 10 middle schools about physics, engineering and renewable energy. To do this, we need the Sol Cycle and a variety of lesson plans.


We are in the process of prototyping the Sol Cycle, a toy-sized bicycle that runs off a solar-powered motor. This is where the bulk of the campaign funds will go. Manufacturing and shipping are expensive -- per unit, about $60 to print and $10 more for the solar panel and motor -- and there will be additional costs for delivery and shipping to us on the road. We printed our first draft at the Sacramento Public Library, and are now working with CITRIS Invention Lab at UC Berkeley. Membership there is a little costly, but their resources and expertise will help us turn the Sol Cycle from dream to reality.




To design the lesson plans, we are talking with teachers and working with BASIS, a science role model volunteering program run by Community Resources for Science in Berkeley, to ensure our plans for the Sol Cycle align with Next Generation Science Standards and are feasible and implementable. And before we leave, we will be teaching lessons in Berkeley middle school classrooms to get feedback.



Interview teachers at each stop about their experiences and challenges, and celebrate their work in the classroom.

How did they get started? What kinds of lesson plans do kids find most engaging? Does the community they live in affect the way they teach certain subjects?
As of the beginning of this campaign, we have already interviewed three educators and have already been deeply inspired by their grit, ingenuity and love for their students. We can't wait to share them with you.



Curate these stories and lesson plans in an online collection, freely available on our website www.cycleforscience.org for anyone to use.

On our blog we'll be sharing video interviews and highlights from our trip, as well as other inspiring science education projects from across the globe.
Plus, we are going to release the digital files for the Sol Cycle, so anyone with access to a 3D printer can make their own.





The Impact

We have spent the last year saving up for this trip. We have the bikes, the bags, the lights, the seats. So, basically, we need your help funding what's important: the Sol Cycle, the lesson plans, the teacher's stories, the good stuff.
Plus, female role models have been shown to play a part in the retention of women in science. By funding our project, you're helping put female scientists in the classroom and showing your support for a more equal, diverse and innovative STEM workforce.

We chose to model and 3D-print the Sol Cycles to help highlight the educational potential of emerging printing technology. Designing functioning models requires careful engineering, applying skills like trigonometry to conceptualize, create and test ideas. At the same time, it also has almost unlimited possibilities: from fossils to musical instruments, students can make almost anything they imagine.

Rachel Woods-Robinson

Rachel is a scientist. At work (which she bicycles to every day, zooooom!) she synthesizes and studies new transparent conducting materials to use for solar energy conversion. In addition to her current love affair, solar energy, she's researched geothermal energy and the Moon (turns out it gets down to -250ºC in some parts, that's some ~brrrrrie~ if you're itching for a cheesy pun).
She's dedicated to spreading science beyond the lab through community outreach. In college she founded Ecochella, a now-annual concert with sound powered entirely by bicycles connected to speakers, in order to educate students about fun renewable energy solutions. She built her own bicycle generator to use at the first Ecochella, and helped initiate an engineering competition (now a staple of Ecochella!) so that student teams design their own generators for the concert.
Teaching ExperienceWe both have experience teaching and understand how incredibly difficult it is to teach good science while meeting state and federal standards. In high school Rachel taught music and trombone lessons, and since then has applied these skills to science to tutor high school and college students and teach renewable energy and lab classes in Bay Area classrooms through the Community Resources for Science. Elizabeth has organized statistics and data journalism workshops, tutored physics and math to elementary and high school students, was a counselor at a science and arts camp, and served an A.V.I.D. mentor her senior year in high school.

And we're both proudly nerdy about physics and incredibly passionate about the need to ensure every kid knows he or she can become a scientist.

<h3>My journey</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Aimee-Josiane! I'm from Rwanda and I grew up in the heart of Africa. When I was 10 years old, my parents, siblings and I came to the United States and ended up staying here as refugees because of the war and genocide in Rwanda. Being a refugee pushed me into activism and I have since been involved in work to lift up queer and trans people of color, to stop violence against Black women and girls, and work to end domestic and international militarism. </p>
<p>I believe that oppression sucks, and that is takes away so much from us including our internal permissions to be our most authentic selves. But authenticity is key to self-determination and liberation. So as I struggle and wait for justice in the world, I find incredible peace in the process of seeking the things that will allow me control of my life (self-determination) as well as the strength to liberate the parts of me that have been erased by oppression. This process can and IS transforming me and people that I know, and now with the guidance and support of my family I would like to share this gift with as many people as possible. I want to be a coach for personal and collective transformational change!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Why coaching?</strong></h3>
<p>Coaching for me comes down to helping. I believe in abundant support, encouragement and self-recognition. As an internationally certified coach, I will be able to help individuals, romantic partners and organizations transform the ways they operate by honoring their gifts and learning how to get unstuck in the most difficult situations. I also hope to radicalize this practice by making it more accessible to people who are most impacted by racist, economic, and gendered state-violence.</p>

<div>Hello, my name is Claire Moore. I am 19 years old and passionately wanna do some good in this world. Why not do what you can do? Who's to say you're not making an impact or changing the world? The suffering of one person is not any less valid than 1 million's. One persons joy in one moment matters too.  I have come to India to volunteer with an organization and I was placed in an incredible girls orphanage. I have been here 1 month and I'm staying 4 more. I have fallen in love with these girls and this place has become my home. I have contacted past volunteers who are also passionate about this place and we are going to try to raise some funds for this place. A little here goes a very long way! You can't imagine what 5 dollars will do. Obviously there is a lot of need so the more the better but every dollar here truly counts. Don't shy away because you only have a small amount to give, it will be used with care and will be spent well and it will be appreciated. I have written more detailed about this place on my blog and in particularly in one post..if you would like to learn more about the 87 girls here and this place please go to the link and read, I promise you won't be sorry you did. </div>
<div><a href=""http://beauty-in-the-chaos.blogspot.in/2015/02/somethings-to-discuss.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://beauty-in-the-chaos.blogspot.in/2015/02/somethings-to-discuss.html</a></div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></div>
<div>There are many needs here and every month it changes. This place gets most of their things and funding from donors but a lot of that isn't money so they make use of what they get. Every month I'm here I'm hoping to do a little bit. I'm using about 50 US dollars (3000 rupees) of my own money each month I'm here (the other day this bought a mirror and about 30 panties and 20 bras) but for a girl on a tight budget that's quite a lot but I still want to do more! Something I recently talked to the director, Annie, about was a garden. I've done some gardening in the past and I mentioned this. Annie thought this was a great. We have some green space here but that haven't been able to do much with it, so my first project with the money is to make a garden. Any money beyond what would be spent on the garden would go for new school uniforms, which is something they need, and then after that school tuitions. As the garden grows you'll be able to see pictures and I'll try to keep up the updates on my end. </div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">The Impact</span></div>
</div><div>
<ul>So let's talk more about this garden shall we? This is great for a few reasons: 1) It's longterm 2) they often get rice and such donated but less often veggies, so Annie has to trade for them, how great would it be if they could also get these veggies from their garden?! 3) Hello helping the environment! (trust me, in India it's very needed) 4) How about spreading beauty? 5) Most importantly I hope to help teach a few of the girls, and they can carry it on to other girls, and this is a valuable tool you can carry on in life, if they have a family having a garden could truly help their future lives. Now let's talk about school. Private schooling here to them isn't cheap but Annie wants her girls to get a good education. Right now though Annie is only able to select some girls once they get older to send to private school and the rest go to government school, and even then it's difficult to get together the money for the private schooling. Not only this but after high school she makes sure her girls get the chance to go to university and training and can even stay here during this time, but this also can be pricey. So your funding would be going towards a place I feel very passionate about helping and very useful things; a garden which would allow an education of this for these girls to carry with them into womanhood and help when they have a family and would be an asset to this orphanages needs and then if more is raised it would be used towards the invaluable wealth of a girls education.

<ul><br/></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>So obviously I can only promote this so much. There is no way to guarantee that I will raise all the funds to make an incredible garden and there is no way to guarantee it will always last and be properly taken care of but I think the more stable and sturdy I am able to make it with the funds the better it will be and the longer it will last. Such as I will be able to buy more shovels and equipment, I will be able to buy more seeds and the proper ones, I will be able to help solve soil problems. The biggest issue will probably be the animals so I'd really like to spend some good money on fencing and chicken wire for that. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Whether you can donate 5 dollars or 50 dollars do it! And make some noise whether you can or not! Get the word out there about this place and what were doing! Send your positive thoughts and prayers and keep this place in your mind. So lets get the word out there and try to educate some girls and hand in hand change the world:)</p>

I have been auditioning for schools since late 2013 and this is indeed the prize that I have been fighting for.I cannot express in words how much I appreciate the support of those who have brought me this far. Please join us - make a pledge to support my quest. I've been working hard over several days to prepare some really great experiences as perks, too! Your help will not go unrewarded, and it certainly will not go unappreciated.  Yours sincerely,Umar---About Umar

to express oneself effortlessly
to express oneself accurately
to express oneself effectively

Our Mission

To foster greater fluency among adult English language learners. How? By building a cutting-edge, state-of-the art website that allows ESL students to converse orally with both native and non-native English speakers.  

An Educator's Perspective
      
Why We Need the Website
Many adult English language learners plateau (level off) before acquiring enough fluency to successfully manage academic coursework. 
Nine Students' Perspectives
(The students interviewed below are all intermediate English language learners. They were not told what or what not to say.)



How We Acquire Fluent English

By listening to others (preferably native speakers).
By speaking the language yourself.
By interacting with others who are speaking the language.
By embracing the language learning experience.

What the Website Will Provide

Online conversation practice with native and non-native English speakers
Discussion of interesting topics that are presented right on the website.
Discussion of thought-provoking films that are watched on the website.
Discussion of engaging video lessons that are watched on the website.

What We Need 
Website Design and Development:  $ 8500 - 4000 = $4500                          ($4000+ already contributed by the founder)

Hosting- Virtual Private Server (VPS):  $ 200 per month
Stock Footage, Photography, Video Portfolio:  $600 per year

What You Get
Be an Honorary Founder!

For a pledge of $ 40, you'll receive a full-year's membership in the ""Conversations in English"" family. You'll have access to all the topics, videos, and lessons...and you'll be able to participate in the online discussions at any time. What's more, you'll be acknowledged as an Honorary Founder of the website in the ""About Us"" page of the website!


The Impact


Your contribution will:



Make it possible for adult English as a Second Language (ESL)  learners to practice conversing in English anytime and anywhere.  

Help bridge the cultural divide--if only to a small degree.
Combat the cultural illiteracy of both native and non-native English speakers.
Open doors of opportunity for many who are stifled by poor language skills.

  Other Ways You Can Help Some of you may not be able to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Get the word out to anyone, and particularly to those who speak English as a second language. Share the need via social media and other share tools.",1.0,2,"1 Campaign

I founded a charity (UK registration 1136035) that works in Zimbabwe called Tariro, which means hope. We have about 80 children (most of whom are orphans) who we care for: getting them into school, making sure they're well fed and clothed, and ultimately, giving them a future. </p>
<p>Most of the children we work with are victims of HIV/AIDS; their parents have died, leaving them sometimes abandoned, sometimes with old grandparents, and always, deeply traumatised. Without Tariro, they would have no hope, no future - to survive they would turn to crime or the sex industry, abused, and desperate. Tariro doesn't just give these children help; it saves their lives.</p>
<p>The children we support live in four centres around Zimbabwe. We work with 80, but there are thousands beyond that need help. We keep finding more children who need looking after and must build a new home to take them in. </p>

</div><div> <p>We need £5,000 as soon as possible so we can build some new, small cottages, each with a house mother, to give new children a family home environment. <br/></p>
<p>The £5,000 would complete the first of these cottages, in Zimbabwe's Eastern Highlands. If we can raise more than £5,000, we can build further cottages, supporting even more children.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Tariro has been running for six years and in that time we have seen our children grow up strong, healthy, and able to support themselves in Zimbabwe's hard economic and political environment.

<p>We have developed real expertise in knowing what particular support these children need, and want to be able to deliver it to more children across the country.  </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We are a very small charity based in northern England.

<h3>About Smart Me Educational Products...</h3>
<p>Smart Me™ originated by inspiration after the birth of my youngest daughter, who was born with Down syndrome.  Putting my law career on hold to be available for her (and my other children) full-time, the educator in me surfaced and the desire to provide her with focused educational tools for early learning inspired the creation of the original Smart Me™ educational workbooks and <strong>DVDs – <i>Colors and Shapes, Letters and Sounds, </i>and <i>Ready to Read!</i></strong>.  These Pre-K and Kindergarten level workbooks and DVDs were designed to provide her with focused visual and auditory learning as well as memory and fine motor development.  They worked!  At age three, my daughter could identify every primary color and basic shape, and could identify and sound out almost all letters of the alphabet.  By age four, she knew all letters and their sounds.  Her Exceptional Early Learning Program (EELP) teachers were astonished at her level of ability.</p>
<p>Realizing that Smart Me™ was a gift, not just to my daughter, but to ALL children, Smart Me™ Educational Products began reaching children in daycare settings, through sales to parents, grandparents, and even teachers, at flea markets, and through word-of-mouth.  I have heard and continue to hear great reports that Smart Me™ preschool products was/is instrumental in successfully preparing children for kindergarten.  And, Smart Me™ kindergarten products are of the BEST available in reinforcing skills taught in kindergarten in preparation for first grade.</p>
<p>In 2011, Smart Me™ Educational Products expanded its product line of Math and Reading/Language Arts workbooks from preschool up to 5<sup>th</sup> grade.  Smart Me™ was excited to make a difference in learning for children in pre-k through 5<sup>th</sup> grade by helping them build and master strong foundational skills in earlier grades for success in middle grades and beyond.  Smart Me™ Educational Products continued to provide its great educational resources to parents for their children through word-of-mouth, afterschool tutoring (Joint Base Andrews, MD), and sales at military Exchange store kiosks.</p>
<p>Smart Me™ Educational Products believes in its products and in its mission, which is… “To make a difference in education by helping children build strong, foundational early learning skills in math and reading.”  With extra practice at home, children are more likely to gain improved understanding of skills <i>and</i> improved grades…  Encouraging continued learning in math and reading, especially over the summer, is critical to a child’s mastery of current and future concepts and skills. </p>
<p>So, now… today… settled after a long military journey and looking forward to a bright, successful future, Smart Me™ Educational Products is rebranded, is reviving and revising vintage products, and is creating amazing NEW products!!!  Smart Me™ is RELAUNCHING in 2020 into online sales and into retail space to bring its exceptional products to children everywhere in a BIG way! </p>

Do you buy that? But now, it is no longer so.        The mobile apps are available via Apple app store and Google Play. You can enjoy various contents such like missions, timer and games through a mobile app that works with JUNECUBE.   However, you need to know about this.In fact, JUNECUBE does not necessarily require a mobile app. Because the processor of JUNECUBE has an intelligent solution algorithm.  So JUNECUBE can tell you the solution on its own without having to sync with the app. This is a big difference from other Smart Cubes.  Light emitting from JUNECUBE can make it easier for the user to solve the cube. This is very direct and most effective.So we can call JUNECUBE as the ""Smart Cube"" or the ""Easiest Cube"" 



 

 
PLUS
JUNECUBE is also a Smart Mood light, so it can be awesome interior item in your place.
The brightness of the mood light can be controlled by the mobile app. 


  Remember light-emitting sequence and rotate the layers of the cube just like that! 

 
    One day in the spring of 2018, my son, June, came up to me and said,     ""I watched YouTube videos and read books to solve the Cube, but it's still too hard.""     ""How nice would it be to have light coming out of the cube and giving directions?"" I shouted, ""That's a good idea."" This was the beginning of the development of JUNECUBE.  So I started searching for prior patents and papers all over the world.  And I was able to collect and analyze the patents related to the cube.   PCBWhen developing the PCB, we have disassembled the cube which is commonly sold in the market and applied the PCB prototype into the cube.   Working prototypeIt was very hard to make the size of a cube like an existing cube.However, if the size of the cube is bigger than the existing cube due to electronic components, users will feel uncomfortable.We've been trying to make sure that all electronic components are integrated into the core of a limited-sized cube. So after repeated 3D printing and revised the drawings, we were finally able to make the current cube product.  JUNECUBE is about the almost same size as the existing cube. 
 
 
 
Amazing Magnetic Cube

All blocks in the JUNECUBE contain magnets.This adjusts to the correct angle when the user rotates the cube.Also, it is made of good material and solid design.You can feel it as soon as you try to twist it. 
Completed mass production system

 
 
  We don't want children to give up the challenge after all because the cube is so difficult.We want every child to master the cube and enjoy the challenge. JUNECUBE can do so. And ultimately, we believe that children will have an ability to solve the any cube quickly without any JUNECUBE's instruction. JUNECUBE's role is just in there.

<h2><u>What's a Manga Library?  Why Should I Care?</u></h2>
<p>The Carolina Manga Library is a non-profit organization that sets up free libraries at conventions for all attendees to enjoy. They bring over 5000 manga, American graphic novels, webcomics, and novels for fans to enjoy. By setting up a quiet place for people to relax at conventions, the Library seeks to promote literacy through the medium that they love.</p>
<p>The Library was founded in 2013, debuting at Nashicon in Columbia, South Carolina. Since then, the Library has been guests at conventions all over the eastern United States and their collection becomes larger with every passing month, having expanded to all forms of graphic novels. </p>
<p>This group travels all around the US to set up these libraries to provide free access to graphic novels to underprivileged areas and to foster a life-long love of reading.  They set up at schools, hospitals, conventions, public libraries, and shelters.</p>

<h2><u>What's Going On?</u></h2>
<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 virus pandemic, more and more large gatherings are being forbidden by various cities in the United States.  This has unfortunately shown that many large scale events like conventions are now being closed down for 2020.</p>
<p>Our largest spring event was scheduled to take place March 19-21 in Lancaster, PA.  That event has now been cancelled with less than a week to go.  </p>
<p>This event was supposed to be our largest spring fundraising event.  We usually raise about 20% of our annual budget at this show.  Without that show happening, we will not be able to pay our bills in March, April, or early May.  Our next event isn't scheduled until mid-May.  </p>

<h2><u>How Can You Help?</u></h2>
<p>After the massive success of our Trailer GoFundMe in 2019, we did not want to do another GoFundMe where our supporters didn't receive anything other than thanks for their generosity.  </p>
<p>Most of the other vendors/artists who were supposed to attend these cancelled shows have the ability to have online sales to try to generate lost revenue.  As a nonprofit, we do not have that luxury.  Instead, we've decided to utilize Indiegogo so that our supporters can have a tangible piece of our gratitude.</p>
<p>We need to raise $2000 to pay our bills for the months of March, April, and May.  This does not include any salaries, this is strictly to keep the vehicles, storage units, and liability insurance paid for.  Anything raised over the initial $2000 will be put away in case any other conventions cancel on us.</p>

<p>If we make it to this goal, our Head Librarian will start a Twitch account and start streaming her two panels ""Great Graphic Novels You Should Be Reading"" and ""What the %#@&amp; Did I Just Read?!"" on a weekly basis.  These will also be released via Youtube.  </p>

<h2><u>Stretch Goal 2: $4000: Making it to August</u></h2>
<p>Since Indiegogo won't let us end the campaign early, we will have a second stretch goal of $4000.  If we reach that goal, all donors above the $25 tier will receive a Manga Library Pop Socket!   Funds raised to this level will enable us to stay in business to August 2020 in the event of more event cancellations.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","What's a Manga Library?  Why Should I Care?
The Carolina Manga Library is a non-profit organization that sets up free libraries at conventions for all attendees to enjoy. They bring over 5000 manga, American graphic novels, webcomics, and novels for fans to enjoy. By setting up a quiet place for people to relax at conventions, the Library seeks to promote literacy through the medium that they love.
The Library was founded in 2013, debuting at Nashicon in Columbia, South Carolina. Since then, the Library has been guests at conventions all over the eastern United States and their collection becomes larger with every passing month, having expanded to all forms of graphic novels. 
This group travels all around the US to set up these libraries to provide free access to graphic novels to underprivileged areas and to foster a life-long love of reading.  They set up at schools, hospitals, conventions, public libraries, and shelters.

In the wake of the COVID-19 virus pandemic, more and more large gatherings are being forbidden by various cities in the United States.  This has unfortunately shown that many large scale events like conventions are now being closed down for 2020.

I feel that the least I can do is give someone else the same second chance that I had, and to give back!   </p><p>    As mentioned above, my story starts in New Jersey. When I was eighteen years old I decided to see a doctor about my chronic migraines. Unknown to me, this doctor ran a pill mill (a doctor's office that freely writes prescriptions for heavy narcotics, in order to get a ""kick back"" from the pharmaceutical companies) and wrote me a prescription for a very powerful, opiate based, painkiller. Before I knew it, I was completely dependent and addicted. After a year or so, the doctor I was seeing began to get nervous after several of his patients were hospitalised, and without pryer notice, refused to see me. Being addicted,young, and not knowing who or where to turn, I began to purchase the prescription illegally of the street. I continued this for about two years. Right around that time, the U.S congress decided to pass a bill limiting the amount of opiate based painkillers that doctors could write prescriptions for. This made them very hard and very expensive to buy on the streets. Like most people addicted to opiates, I was terrified of becoming terribly ill from the withdrawal that is experienced when one stops taking opiates. The only solution my addiction could comprehend, was to use a more powerful, addictive, and cheaper opiate, heroin. It didn't take long for my heroin use to spin out of control. One night, nearly six months ago, I decided that enough was enough and for the next few weeks I relentlessly called drug detox programs in my area. When I finally found a detox program that had room for me, I was very optimistic about my sobriety, but knew that it would be hard for me to stay drug free where it would be so easy for me to relapse. As fate would have it, my mom was visiting from Singapore around the same time I was getting out of detox, so I made the decision to go back to Singapore with her and start over. I know all to well that most people don't have the options that I had, and I am extremely grateful for that. I can't think of a better way to give back to the world then to help the unfortunate people of the world in anyway that I can. I began researching NGO's all around the world, but primarily in Africa. After much research, I contacted a organisation called, GVI. They offer many different programs that one can join. I am most interested in working with the children in the orphanages, teaching them how to speak, read and write in english. Eventually I would like to look into Doctors Without Boarders and other programs through organisations like the Red Cross and the United Nations. Unfortunately, the cost on this program is nearly 5,000USD. When I started my life over, I left everything behind and because of this, I do not have nearly $5,000. I am asking that anyone who ever wanted to help the children of Africa, but cannot either do to scheduling conflicts or other responsibilities, to help me take this adventure and give back to the world for the unbelievable second chance I've been given. </p></div>","My name is Mariah, I am originally from New Jersey, USA.

<h3><b><b>Brief Summary</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We (Sierra and Laura) are community-minded yoga enthusiasts working towards our Ph.Ds in Applied Developmental Psychology at the University of New Orleans. We believe children of all race, gender, and socioeconomic status deserve equal educational opportunities. Because of this, we have teamed up with a local charter elementary school that serves primarily low income and minority students. They are one of the first in the community to implement yoga into their curriculum.  With the help of their yoga instructor, Chelsea (a 200-hour Registered Yoga Teacher), we are working to empirically assess the benefits of a school-based mindful yoga practice, which have been previously linked to academic success. </p>

<h3><b>The Impact: Education and Compassion</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>How do schools create and maintain an environment conducive to learning?</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Public schools are closing due to failing academic performance and graduation rates and charter schools are assuming the role of public education in the city. <b>This opens the door to possibility.</b>
</li>
<li>One way in which schools are attempting to change the learning climate of their classrooms is by incorporating a mindful yoga practice as a required part of the curriculum. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Through yoga, children are learning:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">How to control their own thoughts, behaviors, and emotions</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">How to control their breathing</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To build physical strength and stability</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Compassion</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>As evidenced by</b>:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Learning to calm down and problem solve instead of reacting aggressively</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Reducing anxiety </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Focusing and sustaining attention on the present task</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Learning how breathing impacts how they handle athletic events, stressful situations, or dangerous environments</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Showing empathy for peers</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Why is this Important?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I<b>t is crucial to empirically study the potential impact school programs are having on students.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a lack of research investigating the association between yoga and children’s adjustment.</li>
<li>The burden of implementing programs that are not empirically valid fall on our students, parents, and teachers.</li>
<ul>
<li>We need to know with confidence how a program is beneficial for children before we have mass implementation. If this trend of bringing yoga to children in schools continues, as it seems to be doing, we need to know how it is impacting youth.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>Why is this the Cause?</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p><b>The discrepancy of access to a good education is alarming.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a disgrace that as a society we do not yet live in a system with equal opportunity for a good education. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>I challenge you to find one social issue where education and compassion will not help solve the problem.  </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Through the empirical evaluation of yoga in schools we can speak with confidence about the potential benefits and bring this awareness to the educational community. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>We hope to use the results from this study to advocate for the further implementation of yoga classes in schools. </b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b><b>What we are Asking for and Why? </b></b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>We are asking you to help us show our gratitude to parents, teachers, and students in the form of financial compensation for their time.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>We need parents, teachers, and students to take time out of their busy lives to be in our study.</li>
<li>All funds raised will be put into an account for classroom teachers to use for school supplies that benefit the children in their class.</li>
<li><i> 100% of proceeds will go to benefit the participants.
</i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Your generosity will help offset the financial burden families and teachers face by ensuring that school supplies make it into the classrooms.</b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The overwhelming majority of children who attend this elementary school are below poverty line and some are homeless. </li>
<li><b>Donating $50 will cover the cost of school supplies for one child.  </b></li>
</ul>
<li>The money you donate will help ensure that people receive compensation that will not be contingent on grant funding.</li>
</ul>
<p>To show our appreciation, we will keep you informed about the progress of the study by emailing you a newsletter with information we have acquired from the study (at your request). </p>

<h3><b><b><b>Skeptical about Yoga in the Classroom?</b></b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>This is why we need to do this study! </b>Recently, engagement in contemplative practice-based interventions has broadened from research with adult populations to school-aged youth. Research thus far suggests that involvement in repeated contemplative practices (e.g., yoga, thai chi, meditation) is related to various neurological, physiological, social, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral benefits in school-aged children, all of which are thought to underlie academic success.</p>
<p>The extant research with youth suggest that involvement in contemplative practices has been associated with higher levels of mindfulness, emotion regulation, attention, executive function, aggression, anxiety, depression, somatisation, and academic achievement. In order to explain the mechanism through which contemplative practices can provide positive benefits, the Mind and Life Education Research Network developed a model linking contemplative practices with their influence on neural substrates, psychological functions, and behavior. </p>
<p>In this model, contemplative practices are proposed to directly alter psychological functions (i.e., emotion regulation, attention regulation, executive function, self-representation, empathy, and perspective taking), which in turn alter neural substrates, eventually modifying brain structures. </p>
<p>After several contemplative practices, subsequent alterations in neural activity and psychological functions are expected to change behaviors. <b>Importantly, each physiological function linked with contemplative practice is essential to academic success.</b></p>

One way in which schools are attempting to change the learning climate of their classrooms is by incorporating a mindful yoga practice as a required part of the curriculum. 



Through yoga, children are learning:



How to control their own thoughts, behaviors, and emotions


How to control their breathing


To build physical strength and stability


Compassion




As evidenced by:



Learning to calm down and problem solve instead of reacting aggressively


Reducing anxiety 


Focusing and sustaining attention on the present task


Learning how breathing impacts how they handle athletic events, stressful situations, or dangerous environments

Showing empathy for peers


Why is this Important?


It is crucial to empirically study the potential impact school programs are having on students.

There is a lack of research investigating the association between yoga and children’s adjustment.
The burden of implementing programs that are not empirically valid fall on our students, parents, and teachers.

We need to know with confidence how a program is beneficial for children before we have mass implementation. If this trend of bringing yoga to children in schools continues, as it seems to be doing, we need to know how it is impacting youth.






Why is this the Cause?


The discrepancy of access to a good education is alarming.

It is a disgrace that as a society we do not yet live in a system with equal opportunity for a good education. 

I challenge you to find one social issue where education and compassion will not help solve the problem.  

Through the empirical evaluation of yoga in schools we can speak with confidence about the potential benefits and bring this awareness to the educational community. 

We hope to use the results from this study to advocate for the further implementation of yoga classes in schools. 




What we are Asking for and Why? 


We are asking you to help us show our gratitude to parents, teachers, and students in the form of financial compensation for their time.

We need parents, teachers, and students to take time out of their busy lives to be in our study.
All funds raised will be put into an account for classroom teachers to use for school supplies that benefit the children in their class.
 100% of proceeds will go to benefit the participants.


Your generosity will help offset the financial burden families and teachers face by ensuring that school supplies make it into the classrooms.


The overwhelming majority of children who attend this elementary school are below poverty line and some are homeless. 
Donating $50 will cover the cost of school supplies for one child.  

The money you donate will help ensure that people receive compensation that will not be contingent on grant funding.

To show our appreciation, we will keep you informed about the progress of the study by emailing you a newsletter with information we have acquired from the study (at your request).

Skeptical about Yoga in the Classroom?

This is why we need to do this study! Recently, engagement in contemplative practice-based interventions has broadened from research with adult populations to school-aged youth. Research thus far suggests that involvement in repeated contemplative practices (e.g., yoga, thai chi, meditation) is related to various neurological, physiological, social, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral benefits in school-aged children, all of which are thought to underlie academic success.
The extant research with youth suggest that involvement in contemplative practices has been associated with higher levels of mindfulness, emotion regulation, attention, executive function, aggression, anxiety, depression, somatisation, and academic achievement. In order to explain the mechanism through which contemplative practices can provide positive benefits, the Mind and Life Education Research Network developed a model linking contemplative practices with their influence on neural substrates, psychological functions, and behavior. 
In this model, contemplative practices are proposed to directly alter psychological functions (i.e., emotion regulation, attention regulation, executive function, self-representation, empathy, and perspective taking), which in turn alter neural substrates, eventually modifying brain structures. 
After several contemplative practices, subsequent alterations in neural activity and psychological functions are expected to change behaviors. Importantly, each physiological function linked with contemplative practice is essential to academic success.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I'm a student at Circle in the Square Theatre School about to start my final year. I'm essentially asking as much as the tuition is costing simply because what we have is almost all going to have to go to rent and living costs and that in NYC alone can leave one bankrupt. I hate to come and stick my electronic cap in hand to you all but this is just where we are. Any help would be spectacular, it's been a long road and I'd like to make a good end of it. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3>
<div>I'm asking for $17,000 because this is what they at circle are asking for, this is wonderfully quite smaller of an amount for tuition than other schools so at least that's helpful. I have a single mom putting two kids through college, having lost my father right before my senior year of high-school, as well as living costs being what they were and circumstances being what they are, it's almost financially impossible to do this final year.  </div>
<div>Thanks to Indiegogo's ""we won't keep it just because you didn't make it"" policy, if we don't make our goal, we'll still use whatever we make to go to a payment plan for Circle. </div>
<div>If you make the generous choice to donate to my cause, I can't necessarily give you a perk or something based on how much you donate, you'll have my immense gratitude and have invested in hopefully a successful actor's future and I'll remember you helped if that happens. </div>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Circle in the Square Theatre School has given the world of entertainment almost 50 years worth of wonderful alumni actors, such as Kevin Bacon, Idina Menzel and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman, to name a few. Being a student in it's halls has been a humbling joy and a privilege.  This past year has been utterly life changing and at the end of it, they asked me to continue my journey and finish out the school's program. In the final year for this program, we look more into classical works, further honing a foundation for all sorts of potential works before performing in front of agents and casting directors at the end of the year, hopefully gaining representation and a good chance at working after school, if not being successful as soon as possible after school. </div>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>Being an actor in New York obviously has it's obstacles, being one of thousands of people all looking to ""make it big"" in the big city. Having a certificate of completion of one of New York's finest acting schools certainly can help possibly bypass a good amount of grief that may come with the occupation. Having learnt a great deal thus far from some of the greatest teachers and professionals the world of theatre has to offer, the continued progress can better help get a leg up on some of the competition. </div>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<div>Hi! I'm Ms. Sweeney and the photo above is my AP Statistics class at KIPP DuBois Collegiate Academy in West Philadelphia. This is the first year we are offering AP Statistics at our school. AP, or Advanced Placement, courses allow students to take an AP exam at the end of the year. Students who do well on the exam can receive college credit. Unfortunately, the current budget in the District of Philadelphia has not allowed us to purchase AP text books. We are raising money to purchase a class set of textbooks to help us prepare for the AP exam in May! </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <ul>
<li>The Practice of Statistics by Starnes, Tabor, Yates, and Moore</li>
<li>13 copies at $142.99 each</li>
<li>You will receive a KIPP DuBois Collegiate Academy lanyard for every donation of $50 or more! </li> <li>Any additional funding will be used to purchase supplementary resources for AP Exam Preparation.</li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal, we will still purchase as many textbooks as possible with the funding we do receive. </li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>

<div>
<p>80% of black graduates whose SAT scores
suggest they should have taken an AP course never did. (Source: Insider Higher Ed)</p>

<p>Only 17% of AP test takers are coming from low-income communities. (Source: Education Week)</p>
<p>These discouraging facts are a result of a lack of school funding in black and low-income communities.

This means offering college level courses in order to prepare them.</p>
<p>However, it is essential that students have a textbook to work from. Each night, readings and exercises are assigned as homework, and making copies from the few texts we do have has become a messy and unreliable task.

En parallèle de cette dernière, certains hommes continuent de vivre selon des préceptes ancestraux. C'est le cas des Tau't Batu. Leur mode de vie suit le rythme des saisons. Vivant au milieu de la nature, ils semblent évoluer en harmonie avec elle. Est-ce vrai ? En partageant le quotidien des Tau't Batu, j'aimerais m'imprégner de leur façon de vivre et de penser. Ces dernières se transmettent de générations en générations à  travers l'éducation. Pour moi, ce terme recouvre, la transmission des savoirs ainsi que la manière d'élever un enfant.

I like to do rock climbing and I'm training myself to dance. As a student in psychomotricity, I'm learning the biological, psychological and social developement of a human person as well as his troubles.<br/>I like to understand the others. It gives me the willingness to discover the world. To read the words on a face, to hear stories of strangers, to learn from another culture, to walk on unknown ways, to dare, to create, to grow up are my main goals. <br/>Last summer, I made a first solo trip. With the help of the association Zellidja, I went to Greece to discover citizens initiatives. This experience gave me so much satisfaction that I would like to try again. <br/>This year, I would like to achieve a dream by discovering the childhood in the Tau't Batu community in the Philippines. <br/></strike></p><p><strike><br/></strike></p><ul><li><strike>My project</strike></li></ul><p><strike>                            - Dreams provide strenghth and eargerness to dare-</strike></p><p><strike>As far asI can remember, I've been fascinated by people living in forest. This osmosis between man and environment interests me very much. How can we live with it, without destroying it ? This personal interrogation is finding an echo in the actual society. In parallel from this last one, some people sucessfully maintain a traditional way of life. This is the case of the Tau't Batu. Their way of life follows the rhythm of seasons. Living in the middle of the nature, they seems to evolve in harmony with it. Is it the reality ? <br/>By sharing the everyday life of the Tau't Batu, I would like to apprehend their way of living and thinking. The latter are transmitted from generation to generation by the education. For me, this term is speaking about the way to transmit knowledge and the way to raise a child. <br/>That's why, I decided to make a project about childhood in Tau't Batu tribes.</strike></p><p><strike>In fact, even if nobody chooses where to be born, our environment makes us who we are.</strike></p><p><strike>Childhood carries a particular magic: the emergence and construction of a new human. Due to his frailty, the child needs attention and careness. This last one depends on the place you live in. How are living the children from the rocks ?

Cette expérience m'a beaucoup enrichie et m'a donné l'envie de réitérer.Cette année, je souhaite réaliser un rêve en partant découvrir l'enfance chez les Tau't Batu aux Philippines.Mon projet                     -Les rêves existent pour nous donner la force et le désir d'oser-Les peuples de la forêt me fascinent depuis toujours. Cette osmose entre l'homme et son environnement m'intéresse. Comment peut-on vivre avec elle, sans la détruire ? Cette interrogation personnelle trouve écho dans la société actuelle. En parallèle de cette dernière, certains hommes continuent de vivre selon des préceptes ancestraux. C'est le cas des Tau't Batu. Leur mode de vie suit le rythme des saisons. Vivant au milieu de la nature, ils semblent évoluer en harmonie avec elle. Est-ce vrai ? En partageant le quotidien des Tau't Batu, j'aimerais m'imprégner de leur façon de vivre et de penser. Ces dernières se transmettent de générations en générations à  travers l'éducation. Pour moi, ce terme recouvre, la transmission des savoirs ainsi que la manière d'élever un enfant. C'est pourquoi, j'ai choisi de monter un projet sur l'enfance chez les Tau't Batu.En effet, si personne ne choisit où il naît, cela fait pourtant de nous qui l'on est. L'enfance porte une magie particulière, celle de l'émergence et de la construction d'un nouvel être humain. Fragile, le petit d'homme nécessite de l'attention et des soins.Ces derniers varient en fonction du milieu dans lequel il évolue.Comment grandissent les enfants des rochers ?   Quel place occupe les enfants au sein de la communauté ? Comment apprennent-ils à vivre dans la forêt ? Par quels biais se transmet le mode de vie et de pensée des Tau't Batu ? Dans quel mesure l'environnement influence-t-il l'enfance ?...De cette recherche, je souhaite créer et publier (sur internet notamment), un reportage liant photos et écrits. Il comprendra mon journal de route, mon carnet d'étude et le compte-rendu de mon budget. Cet ouvrage sera aussi imprimé en quelques exemplaires.Ce projet me tient vraiment à cœur car il est personnel et fait le lien entre tout ce que j'aime : mes études, la nature, l'écriture, la photo, mon envie de découvrir l'Autre, divers modes de vies et cultures.Je veux m'y investir pleinement grâce à vous. Vous pouvez m'aider à réaliser mon rêve !Concrètement ça donne quoi ?...Pour rencontrer les Tau't Batu, je souhaite entreprendre un voyage de 2 mois afin de me rendre dans les hautes terres de la province de Rizal au sud de l'île Palawan.Pour ce faire, je pars de Paris. Direction : Manille.A Manille, je reprends l'avion pour Puerto Princesa. Ce vol dure environ 1 heure. A partir de Puerto Princesa, je prends un bus jusqu'à Ransang. Je passe la nuit dans cette ville avant de continuer vers les terres des Tau' Batu accompagnée d'un guide.Ce voyage s'effectue sur plusieurs jours. La bas, je souhaite vivre au sein de la tribu pendant environ 1 mois et demi. Cependant, il me semble nécessaire de ne pas être un poids pour la communauté mais aussi de minimiser mon impact d'un point de vue écologique et culturel. Pour revenir, je recommence le même périple dans le sens inverse.Pour mener à bien ce voyage, je recherche des contacts (associations, anthropologues, photographes, amis d'amis...) ayant déjà été sur les lieux ou y habitant. Je suis sur plusieurs pistes.Comment m'aider et comment puis-je vous le rendre ?Vous pouvez participer en m'aidant  financièrement pour que ce rêve advienne.A quoi va servir le financement ? L'argent récolté par vos dons sera une aide précieuse dans l'aboutissement de ce projet. Par ailleurs, une bourse de l'association Zellidja et de l'Université Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC) le complétera.Crownfunding : 600 euros Bourse Zellidja : 700 euros Bourse de l'UPMC : 500 eurosApport personnel : 350 eurosTOTAL : 2150 eurosMon budget prévisionnel billets d'avions (A/R) : 689 eurosdéplacement sur place : 200 euroshébergement et nourriture : 500 eurosfrais d'impression : 200 eurosdivers : 150 eurosvisa + taxes d'aéroport : 161 eurosfrais médicaux : 250 eurosTOTAL : 2150 eurosJ'ai réservé un billet d'avion Paris/Manille pour 689 euros.Sur place, je vais être amenée à me déplacer en bus et en avion. Après plusieurs discussions avec des gens partis là-bas, un budget de 200 euros convient.Je compte un budget de 500 euros pour la restauration et l'hébergement. Ce dernier est difficile à prévoir car il dépend du temps que je passe chez les Tau't Batu et des contre-parties qu'ils peuvent me demander.RESTAURATION : Selon le Routard, le coût de la restauration bon marché varie de 1.5 à 5 euros par repas. Somme à laquelle, il faut rajouter l'eau en bouteille, car boire l'eau du robinet est fortement déconseillé.HEBERGEMENT : Selon le Routard, les nuits bon marché vont de 6 à 10 euros.500 euros correspondent environ à 10nuits et 80 repas.A mon retour, je vais publier mon rendu sur internet mais je vais aussi l'imprimer en plusieurs exemplaires.Les frais médicaux comprennent le traitement anti-paludisme et les vaccins nécessaires pour un voyage aux Philippines.Si je ne parviens 
pas à récolter autant d'argent que souhaité, eh bien : je le chercherai 
ailleurs (babysiting, intérim, brocante...)Et en échange ? Pour un euro ou plus, vous recevrez un grand merci.Pour cinq euros ou plus, votre nom sera inscrit dans les remerciements de mon reportage.Pour dix euros ou plus, vous recevrez une photo imprimé de mon voyage.Pour trente euros ou plus, vous recevrez une carte postale des philippines.Pour cinquante euros ou plus, vous serez invité à l'expo photo.Pour cent euros, vous recevrez un petit souvenir en provenance des philippines. D'autres façons d'aiderIl n'y a pas que l'argent qui compte. Soutenir quelqu'un c'est plus que ça. Alors, participez à ce projet en le partageant, en en parlant autour de vous, en me faisant bénéficier de contacts et d'informations que vous pouvez avoir. Merci à tous pour le soutien et le partage. Et rappelez-vous : ""La vie est un long champ à cultiver. Voyager, c'est y
 semer la diversité de la Terre. Voyager, c'est l'embellir des couleurs 
du monde."" (L. Lesven)About my projectWho am I ?My name's Lucie THOMAS and I'm 19. I like to do rock climbing and I'm training myself to dance. As a student in psychomotricity, I'm learning the biological, psychological and social developement of a human person as well as his troubles.I like to understand the others. It gives me the willingness to discover the world. To read the words on a face, to hear stories of strangers, to learn from another culture, to walk on unknown ways, to dare, to create, to grow up are my main goals. Last summer, I made a first solo trip. With the help of the association Zellidja, I went to Greece to discover citizens initiatives. This experience gave me so much satisfaction that I would like to try again. This year, I would like to achieve a dream by discovering the childhood in the Tau't Batu community in the Philippines. My project                            - Dreams provide strenghth and eargerness to dare-As far asI can remember, I've been fascinated by people living in forest. This osmosis between man and environment interests me very much. How can we live with it, without destroying it ? This personal interrogation is finding an echo in the actual society. In parallel from this last one, some people sucessfully maintain a traditional way of life. This is the case of the Tau't Batu. Their way of life follows the rhythm of seasons. Living in the middle of the nature, they seems to evolve in harmony with it. Is it the reality ? By sharing the everyday life of the Tau't Batu, I would like to apprehend their way of living and thinking. The latter are transmitted from generation to generation by the education. For me, this term is speaking about the way to transmit knowledge and the way to raise a child. That's why, I decided to make a project about childhood in Tau't Batu tribes.In fact, even if nobody chooses where to be born, our environment makes us who we are.Childhood carries a particular magic: the emergence and construction of a new human. Due to his frailty, the child needs attention and careness. This last one depends on the place you live in. How are living the children from the rocks ? Which place do they occupy in the community ? How do they learn to live in the forest? How is transmitted  the mode of life and thought of the Tau't Batu ?To what extent the environment do they influence? ... From this research, I would like to create and edit (on the Internet in particular) a reportage mixing writing and photography. It will include my road diary, my reportage and my budget. I will also print some copies.I'm thrilled about this project because it's personal and it is linked with all the things that I like : my studies, nature, people, writing, other ways of living and cultures. I want to dedicate myself to this project thanks to you. You can help me to fulfill my dream ! And concretely ? To meet the Tau't Batu, I want to make a trip of 2 months to go in the uplands of Rizal in the south of Palawan.To do it, I leave Paris. Direction : Manila.Over there, I take another plane to Puerto Princesa. This flight takes approximately one hour. From Puerto Princesa, I take a bus to Ransang. Then, I pass the night in the town before to continue to the Tau't Batu lands with a guide.This trip last some days.Over there, I would like to live in the community during approximately one month and a half. However, it seems necessary not to be a burden to the community but also to minimize my impact ecologically and culturally.To come back, I'll make the same trip in the other way. To realise my project, I'm looking for contacts in Manila, Puerto Princesa, and Ransang ( associations, anthropologist, photographs, friend of friends...). I'm following several tracks.How can you help me and how can I give it back to you ? You can help me financially to make this dream happen. What will the funding be used ? The money raised from donations will be a valuable aid in the completion of this project. In addition, a scholarship from my university and another one from the association Zellidja will complete it. Crownfunding : 600 eurosZellidja : 700 eurosUniversity scholarship : 500 eurosPersonnal money : 350 eurosTOTAL : 2150 eurosMy previsional budgetAirline tickets : 689 eurosMovements in Philippines : 200 eurosAccomodation and food : 500 eurosPrinting costs : 200 eurosOther : 150 eurosVisa + Airport taxes : 161 eurosMedical costs (anti-palu + vaccines) : 250 eurosTOTAL : 2150 eurosIf I do not achieve to receive enough money that i wish... I will find another way  like babysitting, work in interim...What will you receive in exchange ? For 1 euro or more, you will receive a big ""Thank you""For 5 euros or more, your name will be write in the thanks of my reportage. For 10 euros or more, you will receive a photo printed of my trip.For 30 euros or more, you will receive a postcard from Philippines.For 50 euros or more, you will be prompted at the photo's exhibition.For 100 euros or more, you will receive a memory from the Philippines.Other way to help ? Money is not the only thing which count. To support somebody is more than that. So, you can participate to this project by sharing, talking around you, and, giving me informations and contacts that you could have. Thanks to all of you for support and sharing",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Realms of Inquiry is an experience based private school that's been around since 1972. Part of our curriculum is international trips, and every year our students go somewhere out of country. Our goal is to give our students experience and education they will need for real life. During these trips we volunteer our time and money to help causes in need. This could be anything from orphans to sea turtles, and generally helping with community building.</p>

<b>New Project: Children with Disabilities</b><br/><p>Working with children with disabilities in San Juan de la Concepcion, La Mariposa is starting a new project as of December 2013 working with Los Pipitos in San Juan de la Concepcion. Los Pipitos is a national organisation that works with families and children with disabilities around the country. Alongside local staff and volunteers we will provide a 6 week program of activities for children with disabilities, including music, crafts, games, and sports.<br/><br/>A few years ago the special education school run by Los Pipitos in San Juan de la Concepcion was robbed of everything. Prior to last week they only had chairs, one table and a chalkboard. There are at least 15 children with disabilities in San Juan de la Concepcion, however only two have been going to school, as the school has no resources. Some children are integrated into public schools, while others stay home.<br/><br/>Thanks to the generosity of students at La Mariposa we donated books, pens, paper, Legos, lacing materials, variety of games, soccer ball, and more! We hope that after this program during the vacation ends, that more children will attend school, and La Mariposa can continue to offer this as a volunteer placement.<br/><br/>The needs for children with disability in this area are huge. We hope this is the first of many projects in the area for children with disabilities. Volunteers are needed between Jan 6th and 20th 2014 for the second half of our program. Volunteers alongside the local teacher and volunteers, will help play with the children, organise a variety of games and activities that are appropriate to the children's developmental level. No experience necessary, but special education teachers, OT's, PT 's, speech therapists very welcome. Intermediate Spanish helpful.</p>

We have planted and preserved a variety of flora for hummingbirds and butterflies. We reforested the land with trees to increase the local bird population, which includes Nicaragua's national bird the guardabarranco. These efforts to reestablish the natural vegetation have also created a habitat for iguanas, lizards, boas, squirrels, agoutis, and coatis. We also have a frog pond which is home to a variety of species (including a non-poisonous tree frog) that help keep the mosquito population down, as well as provide a chorus in the evenings.<br/><a href=""http://www.mariposaspanishschool.com/photos/p-rare-frog.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></a><br/>In addition to fostering an environment of diverse flora and fauna, we also rescue and rehabilitate animals. We have a total of five aviaries for our parrots, parakeets, toucans and other birds. All of our birds kept in enclosures have been rescued, and when possible we release them back into the wild. We have also received rescued animals from the community, including four capuchin monkeys, and others which we could not support on our land - for example, once we released a female anteater and her baby into Chocoyero Nature Reserve. Roaming around the property we have seven dogs and five cats, almost all of which have come to us as rescued animals and we have rehabilitated them. Out on the ridges around Volcán Masaya we have a herd of 13 horses, now in semi-retirement, giving rides to our guests on Sundays and by special request. It may surprise many to know that this project is very costly - food, medicine and enclosure maintenance is one of our largest expenditures at La Mariposa! <br/><br/>Panama is the poorest part of La Concha. The fumes from the Masaya Volcano pass directly overhead, so almost nothing grows there. The Panama primary school services about 200 of the 700 children in the community, although the majority of the children cannot attend school because they have to spend their days helping their families to collect the daily supply of water. With donations from past students, we have built a retaining wall, latrines and a small library. La Mariposa has taken responsibility for regular building maintenance, repainting, and furniture repair/replacement. The guests at the hotel have also donated books, clothing and school supplies. We pay a part time teacher to work with small groups of students in the library, some of whom would be considered to have learning difficulties if they had the resources to be diagnosed. We also used to truck water up to the school for meal preparation, until two generous guests funded the purchase of oxen to do the trip everyday. We hope with the growth of our organic farm that in the future we can provide vegetables to supplement the meals with much-needed vitamins.<br/><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Ruben Darío Primary School</b><br/></p>
<p>Ruben Dario Primary School services more than 200 students from La Concha's barrios Los Encuentros and Los Mercados. Our intention at Ruben Dario has been to replicate the successful library/teaching project that we have at Panama School. La Mariposa and its guests have contributed funds to complete the construction of the library, and supply both the school and library with books, furniture and other school supplies. We received a generous donation that allowed us to undertake a project to build a retention wall to prevent and repair erosion damage. We are paying our teacher full-time now because he is splitting his time between mornings at Panama and afternoons at Ruben Dario. Kids from the morning classes also come in the afternoons to enjoy books from the library in the school's Rincon de Leer (Reading Corner). The library has a lending program so that students can enjoy reading in their spare time at home.</p>
<br/><p>Previously, Paulette initiated a program in the local secondary school educating the students on conservation and protection of the environment. La Mariposa paid a professor to teach a class and organize an Ecological Brigade up until the teacher accepted a position in the local Ministry of the Environment. We still work closely with the Ministry on reforestation projects when feasible. On the Mariposa grounds, we maintain a small plant nursery from which we donate saplings and ornamental plants to our various projects. We plant our trees and other natural flora in schools and public space in and around La Concha. In November 2010 we undertook a project planting 20 or so already large trees around the sports field in San Juan to provide shade.</p>
<a href=""http://www.mariposaspanishschool.com/photos/p-literacy-project.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></a><br/>Although La Mariposa believes that learning English is not essential to local development, we understand that individuals in the community and our staff are often keen to expand their language capabilities. We offer volunteer work for certified English teachers to service the secondary schools in the municipality of la Concha. We also offer hotel guests or volunteers without certification the opportunity to teach English informally through conversation classes to local secondary school students or our staff. Many of our staff would like to learn English in order to communicate more effectively with our guests, which is especially helpful for those people coming to La Mariposa with little or no Spanish background.<p></p>

<b>The Eco-Tourism project</b><br/><p>In October 2010, Paulette attended a meeting hosted by INTUR (the agency responsible for tourism in Nicaragua) at the town hall about promoting tourism in La Concha. From this meeting came the idea that La Mariposa should try to shape the direction of tourism in the community, marketing La Concha as an eco-tourism destination. La Mariposa is committed to working with businesses and touristic places in the community in order to achieve this goal. La Mariposa has already collaborated with El Nisperal Nature Reserve and Coffee Farm offering tours as a means to generate community based tourism in the rural barrio of Palo Solo, La Concha. With future plans to create a field study center for groups seeking a more educational based program, La Mariposa hopes to pursue other community based tourism initiatives in the La Concha.</p>

<b>Daycare Centre at Santiago</b><br/><p>The building used in the afternoons for the Reading Corner in Santiago is now being used as a daycare project in the mornings. With the help of foreign development aid, the daycare is a collaborative effort between the department of Masaya and the local town hall. The goal of the project is to provide free childcare to low income families in the neighborhood. La Mariposa became involved in the project because the initial investment was not sufficient to finish the construction of a kitchen to provide a meal in the mornings to children attending the program. We have since been involved in connecting guests to the project in order to secure much needed donations, such as children's toys, books and school supplies. Currently, we are paying half of the teachers' salaries due to a cut in funding, and we will continue to support the project however we can in future.</p>

He dedicates weekends to working with soccer leagues since he knows the importance sports can play in lives of children and youth, especially in keeping kids out of trouble. La Mariposa is helping Marlin with funding for this league, as well as two new leagues in the municipality. The donations we receive are used to provide prizes and equipment for Marlin's leagues and also enable us to host daylong tournaments for different segments of the municipality. We would like to continue developing sports projects to benefit more children and youth in the community. Finally, with the help of the local town hall we have built a fence to prevent balls from getting destroyed by passing traffic.</p>

Out on the ridges around Volcán Masaya we have a herd of 13 horses, now in semi-retirement, giving rides to our guests on Sundays and by special request. It may surprise many to know that this project is very costly - food, medicine and enclosure maintenance is one of our largest expenditures at La Mariposa! Panama is the poorest part of La Concha. The fumes from the Masaya Volcano pass directly overhead, so almost nothing grows there. The Panama primary school services about 200 of the 700 children in the community, although the majority of the children cannot attend school because they have to spend their days helping their families to collect the daily supply of water. With donations from past students, we have built a retaining wall, latrines and a small library. La Mariposa has taken responsibility for regular building maintenance, repainting, and furniture repair/replacement. The guests at the hotel have also donated books, clothing and school supplies. We pay a part time teacher to work with small groups of students in the library, some of whom would be considered to have learning difficulties if they had the resources to be diagnosed. We also used to truck water up to the school for meal preparation, until two generous guests funded the purchase of oxen to do the trip everyday. We hope with the growth of our organic farm that in the future we can provide vegetables to supplement the meals with much-needed vitamins.
Ruben Darío Primary School
Ruben Dario Primary School services more than 200 students from La Concha's barrios Los Encuentros and Los Mercados. Our intention at Ruben Dario has been to replicate the successful library/teaching project that we have at Panama School. La Mariposa and its guests have contributed funds to complete the construction of the library, and supply both the school and library with books, furniture and other school supplies. We received a generous donation that allowed us to undertake a project to build a retention wall to prevent and repair erosion damage. We are paying our teacher full-time now because he is splitting his time between mornings at Panama and afternoons at Ruben Dario. Kids from the morning classes also come in the afternoons to enjoy books from the library in the school's Rincon de Leer (Reading Corner). The library has a lending program so that students can enjoy reading in their spare time at home.
Previously, Paulette initiated a program in the local secondary school educating the students on conservation and protection of the environment. La Mariposa paid a professor to teach a class and organize an Ecological Brigade up until the teacher accepted a position in the local Ministry of the Environment. We still work closely with the Ministry on reforestation projects when feasible. On the Mariposa grounds, we maintain a small plant nursery from which we donate saplings and ornamental plants to our various projects. We plant our trees and other natural flora in schools and public space in and around La Concha. In November 2010 we undertook a project planting 20 or so already large trees around the sports field in San Juan to provide shade.
Although La Mariposa believes that learning English is not essential to local development, we understand that individuals in the community and our staff are often keen to expand their language capabilities. We offer volunteer work for certified English teachers to service the secondary schools in the municipality of la Concha. We also offer hotel guests or volunteers without certification the opportunity to teach English informally through conversation classes to local secondary school students or our staff. Many of our staff would like to learn English in order to communicate more effectively with our guests, which is especially helpful for those people coming to La Mariposa with little or no Spanish background.

The Eco-Tourism projectIn October 2010, Paulette attended a meeting hosted by INTUR (the agency responsible for tourism in Nicaragua) at the town hall about promoting tourism in La Concha. From this meeting came the idea that La Mariposa should try to shape the direction of tourism in the community, marketing La Concha as an eco-tourism destination. La Mariposa is committed to working with businesses and touristic places in the community in order to achieve this goal. La Mariposa has already collaborated with El Nisperal Nature Reserve and Coffee Farm offering tours as a means to generate community based tourism in the rural barrio of Palo Solo, La Concha. With future plans to create a field study center for groups seeking a more educational based program, La Mariposa hopes to pursue other community based tourism initiatives in the La Concha.


Daycare Centre at SantiagoThe building used in the afternoons for the Reading Corner in Santiago is now being used as a daycare project in the mornings. With the help of foreign development aid, the daycare is a collaborative effort between the department of Masaya and the local town hall. The goal of the project is to provide free childcare to low income families in the neighborhood. La Mariposa became involved in the project because the initial investment was not sufficient to finish the construction of a kitchen to provide a meal in the mornings to children attending the program. We have since been involved in connecting guests to the project in order to secure much needed donations, such as children's toys, books and school supplies. Currently, we are paying half of the teachers' salaries due to a cut in funding, and we will continue to support the project however we can in future.


Youth Sports Project Los Zapatos Rotos Corazón De Campeón (Broken Shoes, Hearts of Champions) is a soccer league created by Marlin, one of our Spanish teachers at La Mariposa. He dedicates weekends to working with soccer leagues since he knows the importance sports can play in lives of children and youth, especially in keeping kids out of trouble. La Mariposa is helping Marlin with funding for this league, as well as two new leagues in the municipality. The donations we receive are used to provide prizes and equipment for Marlin's leagues and also enable us to host daylong tournaments for different segments of the municipality. We would like to continue developing sports projects to benefit more children and youth in the community. Finally, with the help of the local town hall we have built a fence to prevent balls from getting destroyed by passing traffic.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>
<p>Awful headlines, all of them! How do they relate to each other?</p>
<p>Our daughter, Rachel Ann Carr, was only 26 when a man drove his high performance vehicle into her car at 110 mph. There were no skid marks; his car’s black box confirmed the speed at impact. Rachel’s engine was propelled more than 200 feet through the air. Thus you see the motor and the battery sitting in front of her car. The man is charged with felony homicide and other crimes.</p>
<p>Rachel was beautiful, compassionate and full of life. Her two-<br/>fold goal was to bring happiness to someone every day, and to make someone smile. Rachel had been sexually abused at age 6 by a family friend and she knew the pain that little children sometimes endure. She believed that kids should always be safe and should never have to deal with hunger, abuse or ugliness. At Camp at Rachel’s Ranch we can make hundreds of disadvantaged children smile each day for Rachel!<img alt=""This logo for the Camp at Rachel's Ranch highlights the kids we're trying to help plus some buttons, which Rachel collected."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/449112/pictures/original/20120918174113-Camp_at_RR_logo_revised.jpg?1348015313"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Logo for Camp at Rachel's Ranch""/></p>
<p>Rachel’s dream was to build a wonderful camp where poor children could attend for free and experience the activities enjoyed by other the children. She described to us a camp where “<em>kids can just be kids</em>.” Our family members can best endure the grief of losing our youngest child and little sister by building the camp Rachel dreamed of.</p>
<p>One last thing about Rachel- she collected inspirational quotes. You’ll see that many of the perks offered here include various quote gifts made from quotes Rachel collected. Some are inspirational, some are funny.  We also sell them at <a href=""http://www.campatrachelsranch.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.CampAtRachelsRanch.org</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>Let’s Talk About the Camp<img alt=""Map of Camp"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/446403/pictures/original/20120917113657-Cartoon_map_of_CRR.jpg?1347907021"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Map of Camp""/></strong></p>
<p>Through contributions from generous people like you, and a lot of hard work, we will build Rachel's dream camp to look somewhat like this map. It will include four bunk houses, mess hall, gathering room, crafts and computer center, baseball field, soccer field, sand volleyball pit, a basketball court, swimming pool, archery course, lakeside sports facilities and more.</p>
<p>Larry and I have a personal commitment to the success of the Camp at Rachel’s Ranch. We have closed our business and are dedicating all our time to building and running the Camp. I have 12 years’ experience as a camp director, and Larry has been a builder and geologist. Rachel’s siblings, her friends, and volunteers are eager to help.</p>
<p><strong>What Children Will Attend?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Headline: PressTV US Child Poverty Rate Soars to 32%<img alt=""Poor Children"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/441713/pictures/cubepeep/20120914111519-poor_girl.jpg?1347646589"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Poor Children""/></strong></p>
<p>Now nearly 1 in 3 children in the US are living in poverty! Our campers will be chosen from these poor children who are recommended by ministers, schools, and government agencies.  These will be children whose families are living in poverty and are unable to pay for a camp experience. In fact, many camps cost as much as these families earn in <em>an entire year!</em></p>
<p>Rachel wanted <strong>ALL campers to attend Camp at Rachel's Ranch at no cost.</strong> This means one of our winter activities will be finding ways to fund scholarships for the children to attend each year. We have lined up a steady source of qualified and compassionate camp counselors and instructors to help us care for our campers.</p>
<p>We can run the camp and change these children’s lives, <em>but we can't build it <strong>WITHOUT YOU! </strong>Will you please help?</em></p>

<p>We need funds. Plain and simple.</p>
<p>Our plan is to build the camp over a period of years, beginning as soon as we have the funds to do so. We’ve accomplished the preliminary issues with establishing the business. With this funding we can begin building the camp itself right away so we can open in June, 2013!<img alt=""This is a lake on the property."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/449134/pictures/original/20120918175057-lake2.jpg?1348015861"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Possible Property for Camp at Rachel's Ranch""/></p>
<p>We currently have our eye on a 37-acre property that includes a small house that can be the office, a swimming pool, two lakes, and a 2-story barn that can be converted to bunk rooms. The kitchen is sufficient to feed the children until we can build a mess hall.  This will get us started and be ready for our first year of camp!<img alt=""This is a pasture area at a potential property for the Camp at Rachel's Ranch that could be developed into our sports fields."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/449143/pictures/original/20120918175650-la171cc43-m11m.jpg?1348016270"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Pasture for Sports Fields""/></p>
<p>All this can be done if we raise $400,000. If we find enough generous people – like you! - to push us over that amount, all funds will be used to improve the property, adding more sports and activity areas shown on the map, and providing transportation and scholarships for campers. We'll start small, likely with 40 campers each session (about 160 the first summer), and build to several hundred campers per session as funds allow.</p>

Rachel’s engine was propelled more than 200 feet through the air. Thus you see the motor and the battery sitting in front of her car. The man is charged with felony homicide and other crimes.
Rachel was beautiful, compassionate and full of life. Her two-fold goal was to bring happiness to someone every day, and to make someone smile. Rachel had been sexually abused at age 6 by a family friend and she knew the pain that little children sometimes endure. She believed that kids should always be safe and should never have to deal with hunger, abuse or ugliness. At Camp at Rachel’s Ranch we can make hundreds of disadvantaged children smile each day for Rachel!
Rachel’s dream was to build a wonderful camp where poor children could attend for free and experience the activities enjoyed by other the children. She described to us a camp where “kids can just be kids.” Our family members can best endure the grief of losing our youngest child and little sister by building the camp Rachel dreamed of.
One last thing about Rachel- she collected inspirational quotes. You’ll see that many of the perks offered here include various quote gifts made from quotes Rachel collected. Some are inspirational, some are funny.  We also sell them at www.CampAtRachelsRanch.org.  
Let’s Talk About the Camp
Through contributions from generous people like you, and a lot of hard work, we will build Rachel's dream camp to look somewhat like this map. It will include four bunk houses, mess hall, gathering room, crafts and computer center, baseball field, soccer field, sand volleyball pit, a basketball court, swimming pool, archery course, lakeside sports facilities and more.
Larry and I have a personal commitment to the success of the Camp at Rachel’s Ranch. We have closed our business and are dedicating all our time to building and running the Camp. I have 12 years’ experience as a camp director, and Larry has been a builder and geologist. Rachel’s siblings, her friends, and volunteers are eager to help.
What Children Will Attend?
Headline: PressTV US Child Poverty Rate Soars to 32%
Now nearly 1 in 3 children in the US are living in poverty! Our campers will be chosen from these poor children who are recommended by ministers, schools, and government agencies.  These will be children whose families are living in poverty and are unable to pay for a camp experience. In fact, many camps cost as much as these families earn in an entire year!
Rachel wanted ALL campers to attend Camp at Rachel's Ranch at no cost. This means one of our winter activities will be finding ways to fund scholarships for the children to attend each year. We have lined up a steady source of qualified and compassionate camp counselors and instructors to help us care for our campers.
We can run the camp and change these children’s lives, but we can't build it WITHOUT YOU! Will you please help?
What We Need
We need funds. Plain and simple.
Our plan is to build the camp over a period of years, beginning as soon as we have the funds to do so. We’ve accomplished the preliminary issues with establishing the business. With this funding we can begin building the camp itself right away so we can open in June, 2013!
We currently have our eye on a 37-acre property that includes a small house that can be the office, a swimming pool, two lakes, and a 2-story barn that can be converted to bunk rooms. The kitchen is sufficient to feed the children until we can build a mess hall.  This will get us started and be ready for our first year of camp!
All this can be done if we raise $400,000. If we find enough generous people – like you! - to push us over that amount, all funds will be used to improve the property, adding more sports and activity areas shown on the map, and providing transportation and scholarships for campers. We'll start small, likely with 40 campers each session (about 160 the first summer), and build to several hundred campers per session as funds allow.
Won’t you please help us help the children?
We Can’t Thank You Enough - Here comes the fun!
We truly want to thank you for your donation, whether time or money. We think our perks will remind you of Rachel and her camp. You'll see the perks on the right-hand side of the page. They range from personal thank yous, to a set of Rachel's quote cards, to an autographed copy of ""Rachel's Little Quote Book - Messages She Left Us,"" to a week for your family at the Camp at Rachel’s Ranch! Woo-Hoo!
Some of the Perks: When you make a contribution, you will receive a gift from the Camp. Some include Rachel's favorite quotes while others say, ""I built the Camp at Rachel's Ranch."" One even includes a week for you and your family at the Camp when campers are not in attendance.
The Impact YOU Can Make
You can be assured with your donation that you will be personally responsible for:

young lives being strengthened

self-esteem increased
self-sufficiency learned
spirits renewed
friendships developed, and
hope increased
in the campers who attend. 
Can you imagine a young person gaining the self-confidence to know he can accomplish anything if he works hard enough and then becomes the first child in his family to attend college? And all this because of life lessons he learned at the Camp at Rachel’s Ranch that  you helped build!
Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word! The best way to reach our goal is to ask as many people to help as we can. To do that, you can:

Regularly post the following link to your Facebook, Pinterest, Google Plus and Twitter accounts, asking your fans to contribute and share in Rachel's dream to help the children. Link: http://www.indiegogo.com/campatrachelsranch?a=1106390                         

Copy and send this link to everyone on your email list TODAY.  And again next week, and again the week after. Link: www.indiegogo.com/rachelsranch


Use the Indiegogo share tools here on the site. They'll help you share our message at the click of a button.
We want everyone to remember our beautiful daughter, Rachel, and make her goodness live forever by helping us build her dream.
501(c)3 Application Note
We have applied for our 501(c)3 approval, and we're waiting for the IRS to approve the application. Since we can't predict their timetable, we can't guarantee a tax deduction for your contribution until that approval is received.

Continue marching to label and eventually ban GMOs; continue supporting local farms and businesses; continue sharing ways to lead a simple, sustainable, and healthy life; continue connecting families through play, art, food, and nature; continue demonstrating how to vote with your dollar and your fork; and, continue connecting communities and families so that they are supported in making these big changes of transformation during this time of a growing consciousness awakening.</p>

<h3>GooTopia</h3>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We're trying something different. The world doesn't need another generic toddler book about shapes or numbers or letters or rhymes or comparisons...there are plenty out there to choose from.</p>
<p>What kids need is to develop character. There are books on the market with a character message, but no comprehensive set of books that introduces young learners to different aspects of character, and helps them to have fun doing it.</p>
<p>So we decided to build GooTopia, a place to tell intertwining character stories, because in the real world character values are all intertwined. We plan to develop 50 stories about individual Goo Guys &amp; Gals, each representing an important character value. We also plan to build more and more interactivity into our site <a href=""http://googuysandgals.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GooGuysAndGals.com</a>, where each Goo Guy or Gal has their own character profile.</p>

<p></p>
<p>GooTopia Graphic Readers are different in a number of other ways. <b>We intend for these books to grow with your child.</b> That starts with you. At the earliest ages, you'll sit down and read the stories and do the activities with them. That gets them interested in reading, and it helps them to pattern their brain for character thinking. They'll read the pictures and begin to format the left to right, top to bottom reading direction. They'll also be getting ready for school by searching for and identifying letters, shapes colors and numbers with you. They'll even be expanding their vocabulary, and their awareness of the variety of interests people can pursue in life. And they'll have lots of fun with the songs and the audio extras! All of these ""hooks"" (ways of learning) will reinforce the character message over time.</p>
<p>Then as your child grows older, they'll begin to explore the books and the site on their own. The graphic layout of the books will help them to understand the sentences and phrases in each frame. There are over 80 Dolch List words in each book, preparing them for fluent reading later. The profiles, activities and links on the Goo Guys And Gals site will  reinforce the character message while teaching them about new interests. Although the target age for these books is 3-7, we've had some younger toddlers and some older children up to 12 and over really enjoy Olympia On-Time.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Olympia On-Time</h3>
<p></p>This is our beta book, we printed 400 copies and are sharing them with local educators, kids groups and parents. We continue to gather feedback and will incorporate it into future stories. <b>This campaign is to try to  secure funding for a pilot study of cartoon format books and materials in (character) learning, using Olympia On-Time and some other cartoon tools. We intend to make these the best books they can be.</b><p></p>
<p>The Olympia story follows a formula that we will keep throughout the series. First the negative side of the character value is presented. The character realizes the problems it causes. Then the positive side of the character value is presented, along with the solutions it brings.</p>
<p>The size is roughly 6"" x 6"", making it perfect for for manipulation by little hands (another essential skill). All of the books will be brightly colored and come with a Goo Guide that explains how to get the most out of the book.</p>

<h3>Science Behind the Books</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We've read a lot of studies and we won't bore you with all the details, but these books are built on four over-arching premises:</p>
<p>•Vocabulary by the age of three plays a strong roll in future cognitive capacity (which is why we encourage you to start reading to you child as early as possible).</p>
<p>•Children who are prepared for school with certain skills before they start do better and go further in school. Our books incorporate exercises for a number of those skills (see below).</p>
<p>•There is a massive spurt of right brain dendritic branching from the ages of 4-7. We believe that the graphic format, with visual and situational cues, infused action and emotion, and idea summaries are the best way to reach their young minds in a lasting way.</p>
<p>•Character has been shown in tests to correlate more highly with success in school and achievement in life than IQ. Why not  get children started on character education as early as possible?</p>

This campaign is to try to show that traction. We have a Chicago based evaluation team that has been interested in conducting this study for over a year. We just need the funds to do it. This is a small but significant step on the way to a much larger GooTopia. If we receive funding, the pilot will be conducted in late winter and spring. All of your names will go into the final report on a backers page, and you'll receive a PDF version of the findings.</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>South Chicago, 2008. In the wake of the Great Recession, a group of college kids at The University of Chicago founded Moneythink as a way to empower disadvantaged youth to pursue their dreams. They served as peer-mentors in local inner-city classrooms, teaching financial literacy and entrepreneurship workshops.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, students were coming back to their Moneythink mentors with stories: one student had secured a scholarship with the help of her mentor, another had helped his mom keep the heat on in the winter using his new budgeting skills, and yet another launched a student store.</p>
<p>Within a few years, Moneythink programs had spread to 18 campus communities nationwide and had been recognized by President Obama at the White House--a grassroots movement by Gen Y for Gen Y was under way!</p>
<h3>No Obstacle Too Great</h3>
<p>Now, <strong>Moneythink is taking it to the next level</strong>. We're hiring a small, full-time staff, building out new curricula, and developing enhanced training methods. </p>
<p>To prove that we're serious, and to show that we believe <strong>no obstacle is too great to overcome</strong>, Moneythinkers Chirag Sagar, Sam Smith, and Ted Gonder are participating in the <strong>toughest athletic event on the planet</strong>: a 12 mile obstacle course designed by the British Special Forces to test all-around strength, stamina, mental grit, and camaraderie. </p>
<h3>The Mission</h3>
<p>Our mission in running this race is to inspire young people to believe in their dreams and motivate them to take control of their lives, defeat fear, and reach success.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are a group of Moneythinkers who constantly strive to become better individuals, face challenges, and empower others.</li>
<li>When we learned about Tough Mudder, the premier obstacle course in the world, we decided to train ourselves and do our best to motivate younger generations to do things that seemed impossible and out of reach.</li>
<li>For weeks, we have physically exhausted our bodies by alternating routines such as HIIT, TEMPO &amp; ENDURANCE.</li>
<li>We hope this event will motivate other Moneythinkers to contribute to our efforts of transforming lives and building a more sustainable community.</li>
<li>We want to continue empowering high schoolers across the country to make money &amp; manage money with the right knowledge and tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want financial empowerment for all. We are Moneythink!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>More than 2/3 of young adults in the US lack basic financial knowledge.</li>
<li>To make matters worse, financial education courses are required for graduation in only 13 states.</li>
<li>Urban youth are particularly at-risk because they lack access to proper financial services and exposure to financial knowledge via family and peers. Inadequate public education and twice-national-average unemployment rates exacerbate urban youth’s financial illiteracy, entrenching them in a vicious cycle of poverty.</li>
<li>This cycle of poverty denies urban youth adequate resources to become financially capable, income-generating adults.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You contributions will help us to expand our efforts as we make the leap to build a full-time operation and a sustainable model in the 2012-2013 school year. All of your funds go straight to operations on the ground, in the classroom; none of your funds pay for our flights or tickets to the race (we paid for those out-of-pocket). </p>

<li>$10 trains a mentor to volunteer and serve in a local classroom.</li>
<li>$25 provides mentorship and financial education for three students and equips them with invaluable knowledge to succeed.</li>
<li>$100 helps sustain our internal technology and communication infrastructure to keep volunteers updated and equipped to make an impact.</li>

government land grants that steal their homelands without compensation, help
the poorest find innovative solutions to pull themselves out of poverty,

</div></div>","Our Story
South East Asia has a long and noble history; sadly the last
century has been full of war after war after war. These wars have created deep
deficiencies in the educational system and the great majority of the people,
even today, don't have a high school education. The scars of war still run deep
and many people still suffer the effects of wars long gone by. Yet even with
deep scars and fresh wounds the people here are resilient and many choose to
help their fellow human. Yet the desire to help is not always enough. After 18
months in South East Asia I have met many optimistic and helpful people,
community based organizations and
Non-Governmental organizations that are doing fantastic jobs at
helping others. They free sex slaves, rehabilitate landmine victims, fight
government land grants that steal their homelands without compensation, help
the poorest find innovative solutions to pull themselves out of poverty,
educate the future generations and so much more.  There is heart, there is
determination but there is also a lack the knowledge on how to increase
their outreach and success.  
 
I have already started giving free trainings to these
altruistic souls. Trainings to help them get and keep the funds they need to
expand. Trainings to make sure that their finances and policies
stay transparent. Trainings to help them and the world see how much of a
difference they are creating in the lives of others.  
 
I will continue to do my training's in
a more mobile fashion, traveling myself to communities
that have organizations that are helping them but would like to have
my training's. There in the communities I will give my trainings.
 
There are 4 main subjects that include multiple trainings.
They are:
 
1.       Successful funding
2.       Organizational transparency
3.       Monitoring and Evaluation
4.       Research training's
 
The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) training is always in
high demand as most people haven’t had the chance for a formal education in
this field. There are three classes for this training. The first one is Field
data collection which helps them develop monitoring skills in how to
collect information about those they help. Like all classes this class has in
the field activities, in the past I have assigned projects to trainees for them
to develop research goals and then go to specific areas and collect the research.
This class is about 24-28 hours. The next class is on Evaluation. This class
teaches them how to get the collected data and use it in a way that they can
better understand it.  This class is about 16 hours. The final class is
management through data which helps trainees learn that they can make decisions
based on the data they collect.  For
example they learn that If the data is reliable and it says that program A
increased a family’s income by 50% while program B increased a family’s income
by 400%, then they can focus more on developing program B. This may seem
obvious; however without the data it is not obvious and even with the data
making big changes like that can sometimes be very difficult for an
organization that does not understand the underlying information. This class is
about 16 hours.
 
The Impact
One person with a good idea and a good heart can change a
lot. Yet if they can get to expand on their ideas, they can increase their
impact. If they learn how to measure their impact then they can show
others how well it works then others will follow their lead.  
My trainings don't develop the ideas, they develop the
individual and help them to find the help they need and to show their
successful ideas to others. The reason I do this for free is because I truly believe
that through providing these ""capacity trainings"" we
can assure that the best ideas and practices that come from
any person or group gets perpetuated and that the most amount of people
as possible are affected.
If these people do not get trained they will continue to do
good but the expansion of the good they do will be slower or might not happen
at all.
In a real life example, an small community based organization
with limited funding attended a M&E training (which was 100% free to
all participants) and later went on to share their results with large
international aid agencies. the agencies were so impressed by the information
and their program results that they agreed to fund the project for 5 years.

they have to take to come to where I host my training's.
 $500 to cover my other training costs. For
my training's I often do a lot of printing for hand outs and
activities. I also hand out DVD's that contain my presentation and activities
so that attendees can go over them later or train others in the
future.  I believe $500 would be enough for printing
and CD costs over the next 6 months.

 
Please remember I am not asking anything for
myself. I will give my trainings for free, but with your help I can
increase my impacts and truly help others who help those most in
need.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can fund the whole project yourself I still need
your help. I need help from experts to strengthen my trainings, I need
help from adventurers to help me give trainings (don't worry I can train you to
train), and I need volunteers who can help with media and fundraising.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

As a collective, we have been celebrating all that is beautiful and joy-filled about being in community. We have been on our individual paths of awareness, expansion and transformation and believe that at the heart of the Earth's changes, we must continue to stay true to our most authentic selves, speak honestly and boldly when our heart has something to say, and live harmoniously with the Earth, the animals, our neighbors, and all living things. Our Council has expanded to include other visionaries in the community. Together we are co-creating the vision and the model that will be repeatable in other parts of the world. It is our vision to create a similar educational center in British Columbia, Canada. There are many intentional eco villages in existence worldwide.

What We Need & What You Get
Stage One – Residential Educational Center
 
The Educational Facility, hosting the Academy of Alchemical Arts, will be built to support 200 people at any given time.

Hi,
I'm David Rust-Smith and I'm the creator of BiBz. Bibz is an international Xbox and PC game made by youth for youth. it blends education, art, and play to teach players about millennium development goals, geography, gender equality and more.
Kids from Ethiopia, Australia, and Canada have contributed to the game’s artwork, creating everything from level designs to character animations.
By getting youth involved in the creation of the game and having them work with peers across the world, we can help our future generation have a real sense of global community, and understanding.
Everyone involved in the project has volunteered their time from designers to developers. The game is in the final stages of being released, but I need $500 to properly launch it.
This money will go towards promoting the game to the media, as well as printing promotional material, and buying ad-space. I've setup lots of great rewards for sponsors, everything from getting your kids artwork in the game, to a custom version of the game branded just for you.
All proceeds from the sale of the game are going to be donated to Beyond the Orphanage, an organization that helps to support orphans in Ethiopia.

<p>Millions
of children worldwide won’t be going back to school this September, because
they simply don't have access to education - especially kids living on the
streets, in slums, in refugee camps and in areas of conflict. Education can be

desperate situations.</p><p></p>
<p>Money
raised will be spent by Comic Relief UK to help children from vulnerable and
disadvantaged backgrounds to go to school and receive a life-changing
education.</p>
<p><b>Examples
of how your donation could help:</b></p>
<p>£5
could pay for a literacy book for a young person in conflict-stricken Somalia,
helping them get the education they need.</p>
<p>£10
could buy a school uniform for a child living on the streets of Ghana, which
they need to go to school so they can get vital skills and work towards a
brighter future.</p>
<p>£60
could pay for a Zambian orphan to go to secondary school for a whole year,
offering them hope, safety and life-changing access to education.</p>
£300
could pay for a female mentor to work in a school for an entire year in a poor
area of Ghana to encourage girls to stay in school and help them get a better

<blockquote><p>Do you know anyone that needs to get out of their comfort zone? Kids need to network with their peers in a safe indoor environment.  And we want to give it to them!<br/></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>Not only do we want to bring <i>Zones Of Fun</i> to our youths, but we also want to provide a service to the community.  In our initial launch stage, <i>The Zone</i> will set-up an internet cafe.  Believe it or not, but there is still 29% of households without a computer or internet access outside of school/work.  Additionally, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 49% of minority households are without a computer or internet access. One of our initial <i>Zones</i> will be a designated area for computer and internet access for students to complete homework outside of school/library hours.  Moreover, with suicide being the second leading cause of death worldwide for 15-29 year olds, <i>The Zone</i> intends to launch a peer to peer interaction program.  These items would make a great addition to any community.</blockquote>

Not only do we want to bring Zones Of Fun to our youths, but we also want to provide a service to the community.  In our initial launch stage, The Zone will set-up an internet cafe.  Believe it or not, but there is still 29% of households without a computer or internet access outside of school/work.  Additionally, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 49% of minority households are without a computer or internet access. One of our initial Zones will be a designated area for computer and internet access for students to complete homework outside of school/library hours.  Moreover, with suicide being the second leading cause of death worldwide for 15-29 year olds, The Zone intends to launch a peer to peer interaction program.  These items would make a great addition to any community.
So please find it in your heart to help our launch, remember no donation is too small. 




Imagine


It's scorching hot out. Anything outdoors is unimaginable.  And everyone's going absolutely mental. Instead of locking yourself up in the house and hoping for the best, head down toThe Zone instead.
With themed laser tag, pinball machines, arcade video games, karaoke, internet cafe and driving simulators, there's more than enough to keep the ankle biters entertained during the day. Or choose a private session because admit it - you can't wait to spend quality time with the family running through our laser tag battlefield.
The Breakdown Of What We Need From You:

Your contribution will allow us to provide customers with a full featured Internet cafe, peer to peer counseling, interactive gaming, food court, and karaoke bar. An unique, upscale, and innovative environment is required to provide the customers with an atmosphere that will spawn socialization. Successful operation in year one will provide us with a customer base that will allow it to be self sufficient in year two and beyond.


10,000 sodas or cups of coffee - For 10,000 sacrifices of a $2 soda/coffee gets The Zone of the ground.  Donate your soda/coffee to help us and your nutrition.  Encourage your friends and family help us and their nutrition by skipping the soda/coffee with a donation.
The $20,000 goal will help us complete the launch of our internet cafe with volunteers while expanding into the final stages
Any funding over our goal will help us get closer to our final stage.
A goal of $200,000 will immediately fund, launch, and complete our upscale proposed plan with working capital for year one and two.
With the initial goal funded we can redesign the space, and purchase gaming equipment.  If we exceed our goal then we will begin the next stages of hiring additional staff, ordering additional equipment, and purchase grand opening supplies. At $90,000 we will launch the completed proposed version of The Zone to get the kids and family interacting immediately.  We believe this company will be a huge success as there is currently no facility similar within a 20+ mile radius.

Thank you for checking out what we're all about. <br/><br/><strong>What is A Gathering of Stitches?</strong><br/><br/>A Gathering of Stitches is a workshop, studio, and maker lab for fiber and textile artists, craftspeople and small businesses in Portland, Maine. Our mission is to share the modern and historical world of the needle arts through education, shared resources and equipment, small business development, and the creation of community. In simple terms, we're going to teach people to:<br/><br/>                  <strong>sew : knit : dye : quilt : embroider : crochet : screen print</strong><br/><br/>Instruction will be available at all levels. We'll also supply access to specialized equipment, and provide a creative space for businesses to grow, all for the Southern Maine and Northern New England community.<br/><br/> Crowdfunding is the perfect way to help us build this community enterprise. We have invested our own money, time and capital, but want to invite you to support the purchase of specialized equipment for this community enterprise.<br/><br/> While the rent for this space is reasonable, the cost of launching this business is formidable.  The money we raise through this campaign will help cover build-out of the space, administrative software and set up, office and studio furniture, and specialized, professional-grade equipment.<br/><br/><strong>What Will I Find There When It's Ready?</strong><br/><br/>A Gathering of Stitches will have sergers and knitting machines, irons, ironing boards, and dress forms as well as items that are hard for individual crafters to access, such as free motion quilting machines, screen printing equipment and a dyeing set-up.  In addition, we are building a large library of books on all aspects of fiber and textiles, which will be at hand for research and education.<br/><br/> This is your opportunity to help grow the world of fiber arts! For each piece of equipment you fund you will receive our eternal gratitude, a thank you on our donors page, the knowledge that others will be learning with the equipment, and, most importantly, the rights to name the piece!  Call it Sally, call it Stitch, name it after your favorite Aunt, your childhood pet, your mortal enemy. Consider it your patronage for the fiber arts in Northern New England.  It is your legacy and we encourage you to have fun with it! If you are unable to donate at this time, please share our story with your friends and family. Community is built by word of mouth, and your support means the world to us!<br/><br/><strong>Whose Project is This?</strong><br/><br/> A Gathering of Stitches is the brainchild of two women who love craft and the fiber arts: Samantha Hoyt Lindgren and Molly Bergman Quaid. Samantha is a partner in Rabelais, the specialized cookbook shop here in Maine. She is a life long knitter and sewist, having made her own clothes at various stages in her life from the teens to the present. She's had many careers, including as a photographer and photo editor for major publications such as People, Forbes, and Life; as a dancer, which she practiced from childhood into her mid-twenties, including a stint with the Bill T. Jones dance company in the 1980s; and as a baker and a graduate from the Institute of Culinary Education.  Her career has been a crazy patchwork, but it's led to the creation of a new home for the needle arts in Portland, Maine, and all these varied skills have prepared her for this business of sewing together a stitching community.<br/><br/> Molly is a native New Englander who grew up surrounded by handcrafts. Her grandmothers were dedicated knitters and seamstresses and her great-aunt loved to create hooked rugs. A teacher taught Molly to cast on in the first grade and began her lifelong love of knitting. Molly also spent many happy hours of her childhood on her Aunt’s Singer sewing machine.  Since then, she's held positions as a researcher, market analyst, and worked in politics, but has spent her spare time in art school, hosting a knitting circle, and seeking out yarn shops wherever she travels. She believes everyone can make beautiful things to wear and decorate their homes and is excited to be working with Samantha to create a space and build a community for fiber artists and crafters.<br/><br/><strong>Where Will A Gathering of Stitches Be?</strong><br/><br/> Molly and Samantha have found a fabulous location in the East Bayside area of Portland, Maine, an industrial area that’s already home to creative businesses such as Tandem Coffee Roasters, Bunker Brewing, Rising Tide Brewing, The Urban Farm Fermentory, Running With Scissors Artists Studios, Portland Power Yoga, and Zero Station. The 4400 square foot space will be dedicated to large scale equipment, instruction areas and artist studios. We think the cross pollination of ideas that happens when artists and students work together in the same space is limitless. <br/><br/><strong>Thanks!</strong> </p>
<div> We are so very excited to be working on this project and are thrilled with the responses we have gotten to it over the past few months. The community is urging us on and we are honored by their encouragement. We look forward to becoming a permanent part of this vibrant fiber and textile world for years to come.  Thank you for your support in making our vision a reality!</div>

<p>My name is Ahmad Saffi. On July 1, I made a decision to leave my job and fly to Nepal in order to volunteer teaching English. Upon my arrival at the school, I experienced a major culture shock in the education system. The school had holes in the walls, no lights and the students are left hungry and malnourished with minimal to no school meals. During my first few weeks, I still have not met all of my students as many are absent by necessity in order to work for their family.</p>
<p>The government has offereed free education, but these additional costs are still stunting these children's educational growth.</p>
<p>I ask that you help contribute to my cause if you share my dream in giving access to education to every child.</p>

<p>I have worked with marginalized schools in America, but the situation in this school is so dire that the need for help is imminent. These children all share the desire to become doctors, lawyers, nurses, engineers and every other dream they may have but their situation is prohibiting them from making those dreams a reality. Your contribution can change each of these children's lives.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>  My name is Emily Sanders, I live in Centennial, Colorado with my parents and younger sister. I'm nineteen years old. Last September I graduated from boarding school in Salt Lake City. Attending boarding school helped me become independent and explore my interests. </p>
<p>  I'm really passionate about women's rights and empowerment, I think that every girl should have the opportunity for an education. I want to be a leader in the fight to end the oppression of women and girls worldwide. I've been so inspired by movements like Half the Sky, The Girl Effect &amp; 10x10 Girl Rising. </p>
<p>  Now I have an unbelievable opportunity to serve and contribute to communities around the world with a program called Thinking Beyond Borders (TBB). I will be traveling to 6 different countries with a group of peers and mentors. We will live with host families, complete meaningful fieldwork with local experts and academic enrichment through classroom discussions and seminars with host NGO's. <br/><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Money Breakdown</h3>
<p>     <strong>   Program Tuition: $30,000    Fundraising Goal: $10,000  </strong>  </p>
<p> Thinking Beyond Borders has agreed that for every $1 I raise in this campaign, they will raise $2 towards my tuition. Your donations and this scholarship make participating in TBB possible! My goal is to raise $10,000. I will be working hard over the next few months to raise the additional money for airfare and travel expenses. </p>
<p> If for some reason I am unable to pay for my tuition, your contributions will go to the program scholarship fund and support the program and other globally minded individuals like myself. I believe in this program and the positive impact it has on its students and the world.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact &amp; Your Perks</h3>

</div></div>","Details
  My name is Emily Sanders, I live in Centennial, Colorado with my parents and younger sister. I'm nineteen years old. Last September I graduated from boarding school in Salt Lake City. Attending boarding school helped me become independent and explore my interests. 
  I'm really passionate about women's rights and empowerment, I think that every girl should have the opportunity for an education. I want to be a leader in the fight to end the oppression of women and girls worldwide. I've been so inspired by movements like Half the Sky, The Girl Effect & 10x10 Girl Rising. 
  Now I have an unbelievable opportunity to serve and contribute to communities around the world with a program called Thinking Beyond Borders (TBB). I will be traveling to 6 different countries with a group of peers and mentors. We will live with host families, complete meaningful fieldwork with local experts and academic enrichment through classroom discussions and seminars with host NGO's. 


The Money Breakdown
        Program Tuition: $30,000    Fundraising Goal: $10,000    
 Thinking Beyond Borders has agreed that for every $1 I raise in this campaign, they will raise $2 towards my tuition. Your donations and this scholarship make participating in TBB possible! My goal is to raise $10,000. I will be working hard over the next few months to raise the additional money for airfare and travel expenses. 
 If for some reason I am unable to pay for my tuition, your contributions will go to the program scholarship fund and support the program and other globally minded individuals like myself. I believe in this program and the positive impact it has on its students and the world.


The Impact & Your Perks
    Your contributions not only support me as a leader for social change but support the Thinking Beyond Borders program and communities around the world.
   The focus of service in 8 months with TBB is divided into four units. Each unit addressing a global issue: Natural Resources & the Environment, Sustainable Agriculture, Education & Economic Growth and Public Health & the AIDS Epidemic.
   You will recieve perks for your donations, I spent time making the perks special and personal. I want to share my experience with you. I think it's important to show you the impact of your contribution. I'm excited to offer these perks as a thank you for all your support. 
Thank you so much for watching my video, contributing to my campaign and investing in positive change in our world!

</h3>
<p>TECHNE is an arts education organization founded by musicians Bonnie Jones &amp; Suzanne Thorpe in 2010. We teach workshops combining sound, technology and musical improvisation. Through our programs we empower young women, increase their involvement in technology, and inspire them to engage in creative and innovative music practices.</p>

<p>Since the first Girls Rock n' Roll Camp was founded in Portland, OR in 2001, GIRLS ROCK CAMPS have sprung up all over the US and abroad including Sweden, Brazil, Canada, and France. All camps share the unifying goal of inspiring self-esteem and mutual support among diverse young girls through musical expression.</p>
<h3>More cities and more workshops</h3>
<p>This year we're continuing our partnership with several US-based Girls Rock Camps with an ambitious goal of <b>presenting workshops in 8 cities </b>including Philadelphia, PA, Baltimore, MD, Washington, DC, Charlottesville, VA, Nashville, TN, Charleston, SC, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans, LA! <br/></p><p>We are also adding a new twist: <b>a concert in each city</b>, featuring Bonnie &amp; Suzanne in duet, and fellow local female artists.

<p>TECHNE workshops show girls how to build exciting new instruments with DIY electronics, explore creative sound-making techniques, and collaborate together in a fun group improvisation. We also like to sneak in key audio and technology concepts, including an overview of the physics of sound, signal flow, and basic circuitry. Nerd girl alert!</p>
<p>After the workshop, the girls take home a unique, self-crafted instrument and, we hope, a new and fresh perspective on music making and self-expression.</p><p><img alt=""Techne Workshop"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://techneworkshops.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/camp2.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 580px; height: 200px;"" title=""Techne Workshop""/></p><h3></h3><h1><em>Here’s where you come in...</em></h1>

<p>Your support will enable TECHNE and Girls Rock camps to offer kick-ass workshops in electronic music to young women!</p>
<h3>The money situation</h3>

<p>TECHNE wants to bridge that gap. We want to embolden young women to take that soldering iron, computer mouse or circuit board in hand and feel empowered by their technology skills.

<p></p>
<p>The <i>Museum of Sacred, Magical and Medicinal Plants</i>, the only one of its kind, founded in 2011 as a non-for-profit institution, presents to a lay audience a systematic body of information on the ancient indigenous healing traditions of the Amazon and the high Andes of South America. These are based in the knowledge of the properties of over 8,000 plants, few of which have been fully analyzed and still less have become available to patients worldwide in a standardize form. Our mission is to recover and disseminate information on a rich herbal tradition which is being lost at a fast rate, before it is too late.</p><p>Our increased number of visitors from all over the world (we are on the way to Machu Picchu, the lost Inca city) 
has not yet been enough to generate the necessary income to become sustainable. 
Based in the rate of growth of visitors we
should be able to cover our operational costs by the end of 2014.  In the last years we have been receiving the generous support of individuals in Peru but this has come to an end. Now we confront a very difficult financial situation that will probably lead to the closing of the museum in the first semester of 2014. </p>
<p>Thus, we demand your help in order to deal with our financial crisis and to start a new &amp; improved museum in a different location as the present one is unsustainable due to the high rental costs it requires.</p><p>Also, through this campaign, we can provide all those

This is the first ""real"" check that Ashleigh has ever earned!!  Ashleigh's Premium Check totaled $24 and she is VERY proud of it! Ashleigh decided that instead of purchasing an iTunes Card or heading to Claire's, she<span class=""text_exposed_show""> wanted to do something BIGGER with her hard earned money. So, she asked to donate the $24 to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital to help kids battling illnesses. Ashleigh has had people express interest in helping her with her goal to help kids by stating that they would like to ""MATCH"" her $24 donation to help make a larger donation for St. Jude!!! Ashleigh will gather up all her donations and make one BIG donation to St. Jude at the St. Jude Country Radiothon to be held February 28-29, 2012! Our local radio station, US 92 will host the event and Ashleigh hopes to bring smiles to their faces with her donation.

Ashleigh Nelson is 9 years old. She is in Third Grade at Elkhorn Valley Elementary School. She is very active in various activities, including 4H. Ashleigh recently received her 4H Premium Check for her efforts of showing her prized kitty, Princess and showing various produce at our local fair. This is the first ""real"" check that Ashleigh has ever earned!!  Ashleigh's Premium Check totaled $24 and she is VERY proud of it! Ashleigh decided that instead of purchasing an iTunes Card or heading to Claire's, she wanted to do something BIGGER with her hard earned money. So, she asked to donate the $24 to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital to help kids battling illnesses. Ashleigh has had people express interest in helping her with her goal to help kids by stating that they would like to ""MATCH"" her $24 donation to help make a larger donation for St. Jude!!! Ashleigh will gather up all her donations and make one BIG donation to St. Jude at the St. Jude Country Radiothon to be held February 28-29, 2012! Our local radio station, US 92 will host the event and Ashleigh hopes to bring smiles to their faces with her donation. She would LOVE to inspire more kids to want to help the kids at St. Jude and Ashleigh would LOVE your support with her fundraiser!!!
