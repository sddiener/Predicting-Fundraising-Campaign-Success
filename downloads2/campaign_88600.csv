<p>Most people think that only high prices cars are stolen, but statistics show that is not true. It is true that high priced cars are very attractive to thieves, but the midrange and even low-range cars are easier to steal and there is a great demand of parts of such vehicles. Therefore, the mid-priced cars are also stolen because it is very profitable.</p>

<div><span style=""font-size: 30px;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 38px;""><b>FAQ</b></span></div> <p><b>Q: What are the differences between a conventional GPS and LocMyCar?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">A: The GPS technology use triangulation by satellite. This system is effective outdoor and when there are no obstacles such high-rise buildings. In LocMyCar, we have achieve what is called Total Location. This means that we do not have these previous limitations. We have added a number of technologies (Interior Locations, BLE, and GSM) and we use them to work together. In this way, LOCMYCAR can locate your car in any circumstance. In addition, LocMycar warns you via your Smartphone at the same time the theft is taking place.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Q: Why is it so important TOTAL GEOLOCATION?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">A: Remember that the first thing criminals will do is hide your vehicle to remove or change its identity. If your car has been hidden, the GPS will not be able to locate it. If you really want to recover your vehicle, you need something else. You need  LocMycar. TOTAL GEOLOCATION.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Q: What if there is no GSM coverage?</b></p>
<p>A: If your vehicle is in an area with no GSM coverage the system will not be able to communicate with you. As soon as signal the device recovers the coverage, the communication will be restored. Is there no option when coverage is lost?</p>
<p>No, not at all. First, it’s not unusual finding areas without GSM coverage. Furthermore, LocMycar shows you the path the thief has followed. It can give you an idea where your vehicle is. Remember that if your vehicle does not currently have GSM coverage, there is an alternative system, which emits a signal that can be received by your Smartphone and that can be detected from the exterior of the buildings. Your vehicle will continue emitting the signal until you find it. If you move near the zone where the tracking was lost, your Smartphone will warn you are close to your vehicle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Q: What countries can use LocMyCar?</b></p>
<p>A: LocMyCar practically works in all countries of the world. We have contracted with an international telephony platform that works with the major carriers to ensure service anywhere. At the bottom of the page, you will see countries with rates. If your country is not listed, contact us and we will tell you the fee for your country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Q. There really is no MONTHLY COST REALLY?</b></p>
<p>A: The monthly fee for all those who support us at the crowdfunding phase will never be charged. After that, new clients will pay a monthly fee plus the phone company rate. The absence of monthly charges is a promotion for those for all those who trust us in this LocMyCar's initial phase</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Q: If interior location is not a free service, how can LocMyCar not charge monthly fees?</b></p>
<p>A: Certainly, indoor location services represent a cost to us. However, our company already has licenses to provide this service to other customers and as a reward to all who support us in this project, we will assume that cost. Those who do not use this opportunity will have lost its great offer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Q: Is it easy to install?</b></p>
<p>A: It is very easy. We send instructions with the device. You can do it yourself or ask a professional. In any case, it will take less than 10 minutes. Remember that you can also run perfectly without installing. You only need to charge the battery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Q: DO ALL THE SYSTEMS USED FOR THE LOCATION THE SAME PRECISION? </b></p>
<p>A: Depending on the system used for location, different colors are used in the map.</p>
<p>The red flag is the most accurate. Generally have a margin of error of about 5 m.<br/>The green flag has a margin of error ranging from 15-40 m.<br/>The magenta flag has a variable margin shown in the chart itself.</p>
<p>When the system interprets that the vehicle has stopped, it shows a totally different flag</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Q: How can LocMyCar detects that the vehicle has been stolen?</b></p>
<p>A: When the vehicle moves, you receive a warning in your Smartphone. To receive such warning you must “arm” the system, otherwise you will not receive the notification. In both cases, the system will geo-track ALWAYS the vehicle, which you can see all time in your smartphone. When the vehicle is not on alarm, LocMyCar only uses GPS. Once the owner checks the robbery, he only must activate the alarm in his Smartphone and immediately 6 locating and 2 tracking systems will be activated</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Q: If my vehicle has been stolen, will I be able of finding it when they hide it in a private place?</b></p>
<p>A: LocMyCar is prepared for this case. The device emits a coded signal with the device identity that can detect if the vehicle is in a private building. The reception distance varies between 30-70 m. Looking at the map, you will know the area in which the vehicle has been hidden, but once you go near that area, you can determine with certainty where the vehicle is. No matter it is hidden in a private place. You can do it from outside the building without entering.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Q: What kind of smartphone do I need?</b></p>
<p>A: LocMyCar works with iOS 6 and Android version 4.3 or higher. Both cases require you to have Bluetooth 4.0.  Most of the current mobile phones meet these requirements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Q: Who gets notice of the theft?</b></p>
<p>A: It can notify the owner or more assigned persons. The owner has a code and just he can decide if the notice it´s sent to him or additional people.  It´s up to you.</p>

</div></div>","Video en EspañolVídeo em PortuguêsVidéo en Français  This has happened to thousands of people.  Perhaps too late for each, but you are have time.Shortly after the robbery, even before you may have realized it has taken place, your car will be disassembled to be sold for parts or with another identity hundreds kilometers away from you.
 

It is a complete Geolocation device. In LocMyCar we use all the available technologies and adapt them to locate your vehicle under any circumstances. You will be able to trace your vehicle even if it is hidden in a building or in a garage. Wherever your vehicle is located, only you, using your Smartphone (IOS or Android,) will know the exact location of your vehicle.

What kinds of technologies are used by LocMyCar to obtain an exact location?

The combination of all the available technologies makes your vehicle virtually impossible to be hidden. Remember GPS is not enough. 
LocMyCar reports to you immediately if your vehicle has been stolen.
The device can be places in your vehicle also it can be place without being permanently installed.
The installation requires 10 minutes to install the device. (Even less if is done by a professional). One of the advantages is that you will not have to worry about the battery because it lasts for several days and the application let you know when it needs to be charged. It is recommended to charge the device using the car charger (Android micro USB type) before the installation.

A lot. I will explain in further detail below.


What impact would this have on your family economy?
LocMyCar gives you the peace of mind that no one will be able to take away your car. Remember that for families, buying a car is a big financial investment (only superseded by the purchase of a home).Taking in to account that your car is almost all the time outside in the public or open spaces it is important to reconsider this option 
If you think closely, protecting your vehicle is inexpensive compared to the risk of the loss.

Most people think that only high prices cars are stolen, but statistics show that is not true. It is true that high priced cars are very attractive to thieves, but the midrange and even low-range cars are easier to steal and there is a great demand of parts of such vehicles. Therefore, the mid-priced cars are also stolen because it is very profitable.

Most stolen vehicles in USA are as follows in order of highest to lowest.(Honda Civic, Toyota Camry, Tollota Corolla, Chervrolet Silverado, Acura Integra, Cadillac Escalade, Ford F-350, Nissan Altima, Chevrolet Tahoe)
 
Honda Civic
 
 
                           Toyota Camry
 
Toyota Corolla
 
Chevrolet Silverado

 The most stolen vehicles in Europe are as follows (in order of highest to lowest.)
(Seat León, VW Golf, BMW Serie 3, Seat Ibiza, VW Pasat, Renault Mégane, Audi A4, Ford Escort, Ford Fiesta, Ford Focus).

 
Seat León
 
VW Golf
 
  Bmw serie 3
 
Seat Ibiza
Statistics show that the average age of stolen vehicle is between 3 and 6 year old. Approximately 71% of stolen vehicles never appear.  If you want to control the path of your vehicle when you take your kids or anyone else, you can do it very easily. You only have to watch your Smartphone and see on the spot the itinerary, speed, most recent location and the distance.

Today we have a fully operative prototype and the mobile application is also complete.
Everything is ready to start mass production.
 


 
 
We have been working on LocMyCar for over a year and we have come a long way. Now we need to be able to make a good quantity of devices and, in this way, make LocMyCar a reality. The further along we are, the cheaper it will be for everyone. We all are going to live calmer and we will make possible that the experience of having a car is more agreeable
 
So why should you support us?

Be the first one to get one.
You will feel more calm and confident in everything that has to do with your car.
Because you worked hard to get your car.
Because we are sure that LocMyCar will improve your life.



If you like our project, tell everyone. You can use the apps that are just under the initial video. Talk about us to others. Spread the word.
FAQ Q: What are the differences between a conventional GPS and LocMyCar?
A: The GPS technology use triangulation by satellite. This system is effective outdoor and when there are no obstacles such high-rise buildings. In LocMyCar, we have achieve what is called Total Location. This means that we do not have these previous limitations. We have added a number of technologies (Interior Locations, BLE, and GSM) and we use them to work together. In this way, LOCMYCAR can locate your car in any circumstance. In addition, LocMycar warns you via your Smartphone at the same time the theft is taking place.
 
Q: Why is it so important TOTAL GEOLOCATION?
A: Remember that the first thing criminals will do is hide your vehicle to remove or change its identity. If your car has been hidden, the GPS will not be able to locate it. If you really want to recover your vehicle, you need something else. You need  LocMycar. TOTAL GEOLOCATION.
 
Q: What if there is no GSM coverage?
A: If your vehicle is in an area with no GSM coverage the system will not be able to communicate with you. As soon as signal the device recovers the coverage, the communication will be restored. Is there no option when coverage is lost?
No, not at all. First, it’s not unusual finding areas without GSM coverage. Furthermore, LocMycar shows you the path the thief has followed. It can give you an idea where your vehicle is. Remember that if your vehicle does not currently have GSM coverage, there is an alternative system, which emits a signal that can be received by your Smartphone and that can be detected from the exterior of the buildings. Your vehicle will continue emitting the signal until you find it. If you move near the zone where the tracking was lost, your Smartphone will warn you are close to your vehicle.
 
Q: What countries can use LocMyCar?
A: LocMyCar practically works in all countries of the world. We have contracted with an international telephony platform that works with the major carriers to ensure service anywhere. At the bottom of the page, you will see countries with rates. If your country is not listed, contact us and we will tell you the fee for your country.
 
Q. There really is no MONTHLY COST REALLY?
A: The monthly fee for all those who support us at the crowdfunding phase will never be charged. After that, new clients will pay a monthly fee plus the phone company rate. The absence of monthly charges is a promotion for those for all those who trust us in this LocMyCar's initial phase
 
Q: If interior location is not a free service, how can LocMyCar not charge monthly fees?
A: Certainly, indoor location services represent a cost to us. However, our company already has licenses to provide this service to other customers and as a reward to all who support us in this project, we will assume that cost. Those who do not use this opportunity will have lost its great offer.
 
Q: Is it easy to install?
A: It is very easy. We send instructions with the device. You can do it yourself or ask a professional. In any case, it will take less than 10 minutes. Remember that you can also run perfectly without installing. You only need to charge the battery.
 
Q: DO ALL THE SYSTEMS USED FOR THE LOCATION THE SAME PRECISION? 
A: Depending on the system used for location, different colors are used in the map.
The red flag is the most accurate. Generally have a margin of error of about 5 m.The green flag has a margin of error ranging from 15-40 m.The magenta flag has a variable margin shown in the chart itself.
When the system interprets that the vehicle has stopped, it shows a totally different flag
 
Q: How can LocMyCar detects that the vehicle has been stolen?
A: When the vehicle moves, you receive a warning in your Smartphone. To receive such warning you must “arm” the system, otherwise you will not receive the notification. In both cases, the system will geo-track ALWAYS the vehicle, which you can see all time in your smartphone. When the vehicle is not on alarm, LocMyCar only uses GPS. Once the owner checks the robbery, he only must activate the alarm in his Smartphone and immediately 6 locating and 2 tracking systems will be activated
 
Q: If my vehicle has been stolen, will I be able of finding it when they hide it in a private place?
A: LocMyCar is prepared for this case. The device emits a coded signal with the device identity that can detect if the vehicle is in a private building. The reception distance varies between 30-70 m. Looking at the map, you will know the area in which the vehicle has been hidden, but once you go near that area, you can determine with certainty where the vehicle is. No matter it is hidden in a private place. You can do it from outside the building without entering.
 
Q: What kind of smartphone do I need?
A: LocMyCar works with iOS 6 and Android version 4.3 or higher. Both cases require you to have Bluetooth 4.0.  Most of the current mobile phones meet these requirements.
 
Q: Who gets notice of the theft?
A: It can notify the owner or more assigned persons. The owner has a code and just he can decide if the notice it´s sent to him or additional people.  It´s up to you.
 
Q: How does LocMyCar work when I want to know where I have parked?
A: Pressing the button to know where I´ve parked, the application will return a map showing the location of your car right at the time it was stopped.
 
Q: Can this be misused and can invade my privacy?
A: The system can only be installed by the vehicle owner. The application has a code and only vehicle owner would know where he is.
 
Q: If it is used as control parental may it increase the telephone rate?
A: No
 
Q: HOW IS THE TELEPHONE RATE HANDLED?
A: As stated above, we have obtained a good price, with a phone company that offer international coverage. The device has a pre-installed phone card that allows this correct functioning. The card is in fully operational at the moment of the delivery, but only it will start billing from the 1st of the following month of the delivery. The price will be $5, 50 per month (Duty free). To avoid bank charges, the billing will be quarterly. 
 
Q: Which countries have the telephone rate of € 5,50 per month?
USA, Europe, Mexico, Colombia and Ecuador. For other countries, please consult the rates.

<p>Hey fellow Chaturbate pervs and other internet people!<br/><br/>I'm <a href=""https://twitter.com/BoobiesTrap"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@BoobiesTrap</a>, a <a href=""https://chaturbate.com/affiliates/in/grq0/SlBHk/?track=indiegogo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chaturbate</a> user, occassional broadcaster, experienced moderator and, as it happens to be, a software engineer in real life.</p>
<br/><p>Those of you broadcasting, modding or otherwise familiar with chat apps &amp; bots on Chaturbate know the problem (everybody else: there is an explanation below ;-) ): finding bots that offer what you want and work together, remembering all the commands, and dealing with annoyances that come with somee of those bots.<br/><br/>In this project, I will develop a bot that bundles most commonly used features into on bot that offers customisation, intuitive and consistent commands, clean code and compatibility with as many other bots as possible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>Chaturbate's chat system lacks basic functionality. There is no 
access control, no fine grained moderation and while silencing 
individual users is working fine, unsilencing them again is an 
all-or-none operation.<br/>To make up for it, Chaturbate allows 
broadcasters to run small applications that enhanve the chat with 
additional features, such as control over graphics, sending 
notifications, censoring words or auto-moderation.</p>
<p>As nice as it sounds, a lot of bots are badly written and instable, hard to use due to cryptic commands and barely configurable. And combining multiple bots often leads to compatibility issues, inconsistent commands (was it !b or /b again?) and duplicated features.<br/>Sadly, this even applies to popular and widely used bots, such as <a href=""https://chaturbate.com/apps/app_details/ultra-bot/?slot=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ultrabot</a> (which offers great functionality but has some odd quirks to it and a lot of unused features), <a href=""https://chaturbate.com/apps/app_details/crazynote/?version=&amp;slot=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CrazyNote</a> (which offers everything anybody needs in regard to sending notices, but has hard to remember commands) or <a href=""https://chaturbate.com/apps/app_details/boobiestraps-censorship-bot/?version=&amp;slot=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my very own censorship bot </a>(which is very limited in what it does).<br/>In
 addition to that, spots for bots are limited to three, so more often 
than not broadcasters have to decide for one and against another bot to 
run.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>In theory, the solution to all this is pretty easy: what if there was one bot that includes all commonly used functionality, has clean code is easy on ressources making it run stable, is easy to extend to avoid ""patchwork code"" (which is what makes many existing bots unstable), offers intuitive and consistent commands that are easy to remember and is well documented and easy to learn?</p>
<p>Imagine you could:</p>
<span><i>/allow graphics #all<br/>/block graphics #grey<br/>/allow graphics nice_gray_guy<br/>/block all-caps #all<br/>/allow all-caps #moderators<br/>/set notice.color blue<br/>/set notice.weight bold<br/>/allow notice #moderators<br/>/notice Hey everybody!<br/>/silence #grey<br/>/unsilence that_one_grey_you_kinda_like<br/>/help<br/>/list permissions<br/>/list commands<br/>...</i><br/><br/></span>
<p>Yes, you got that right. with only very few commands, that also do exactly what they say, you could control everything. Giving or taking individual permissions to entire groups or individual users independently, changing all settings without restarting the bot, and so on.</p>
<p>Cool, right?</p>
<p>Sadly there is a reason such bot does not exist yet: creating it, and creating it in a way that not only the developer and some models but as many people as possible like how it works, is not an easy task.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The finances</h3>
<p>Designing and programming this piece of software unfortunately takes some time. Being a freelance programmer, investing time in this project means investing less time in other projects that get me money - and as a matter of fact, we all need to earn some cash every now and then.</p>
<p>At a rough estimate, planning what features to implement and how to make them work together will take 5 hours, developing interfaces for individual parts to be easily integrated into the bot will take 15 hours, programming those interfaces and all features another 15 hours, and smoothing all edges to make it easdy to work with for broadcasters another 5. For testing and bug fixing, it is common to estimate the one to two times the development time, so adds another 40 to 80 hours.<br/>The funding goal of $750 covers the time I need to invest to come up with clean and stable code.</p>
<p>If the funding goal is not reached, I will still work on this bot, potentially leaving out some features or spending less time focusing on performance (leaving the  bot more prone to crashes when Chaturbate servers are busy) or publishing only a basic version of the bot as a resource for other developers and using it to offer more efficient custom bots.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The challenge<br/>
</h3>
<p>Of course funding the development is only one challenge. <b>Your</b> challenge. Programming it isn't easy either - that is <b>my</b> challenge.</p>
<br/>
<p>I know the theory. I studied computer science in university for 6 years. I know how to design effective software, I know about efficient data storage, I know about elegant framework design.</p>

<p>I have the experience. I wrote over 15 different apps and bots for chaturbate so far, simple ones to feature packed custom creations for individual models. So far, none of my bots &amp; apps is, to my knolwedge, known to crash or function improperly. I count that as a big success.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>However</b> dedicating bots to individual tasks is a whole different story than including all kinds of functionality in one bot without any of the parts interfering with each other.<br/>
On one hand, each part should be isolated fomr each other, to keep the code clean and easy to maintain (in programming, this is called KISS - ""keep it simple, stupid!"", on the other hand repetition should be avoided to reduce the risk of bugs - if 5 parts do the same thing, good luck finding the buggy one!

This means core functionality must be seperate and accessible by individual parts of the bot.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><b>The objective of this project is to create a social network based on the MemeSpeak platform.  Messages can be immediately created and posted for Facebook users and WhatsAPP messaging. As the MemeSpeak system is used by speaking animation creators, a </b><i><b>shadow social network of related conversation</b></i><b> will be created automatically as users submit new faces for speaking animation and post them in messages and on other social networks or blogs.

The system supports multiple language text inputs and natural language audio outputs in English, French, Spanish, German, Polish, Portuguese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Vietnamese, Russian, Italian, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, Arabic and Czech. Think of it as WhatsAPP, but with video messaging longer than 10 seconds...in fact, potentially much longer because the video itself is not transmitted</p>

<br/><p>The system can support hundreds of thousands of concurrent mobile or PC video clients and/or creators. Viewers do not need to be members of MemeSpeak™ to view the conversations on social networks or blogs. Any mobile platform with an internet browser can use the MemeSpeak™ system.</p>
<p>Globally, the website will appear in multiple Unicode-supported languages. The system can be scaled and hosted on Cloud networks to support 100,000's of concurrent viewers.</p>
<p>The animations, created through text-to-speech on the MemeSpeak™ website, which has most of the features of YouTube, allow users to create the animations and connect them through dynamic ""learning"" playlists of textual (and emotional) memes (which are automatically hash tagged) – then, they are distributed freely among friends or members of any existing social networks Facebook, Twitter, etc – only the textual links to the animations are shared or transmitted. (In fact, any social network can utilize generic avatar episodes or the novel MemeSpeak™ playlist pages can be embedded.) The meme tags are also searchable, unlike most blog commentary, through Google, etc. and evolve through SEO.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The objective of this project is to create a social network based on the MemeSpeak platform.  Messages can be immediately created and posted for Facebook users and WhatsAPP messaging. As the MemeSpeak system is used by speaking animation creators, a shadow social network of related conversation will be created automatically as users submit new faces for speaking animation and post them in messages and on other social networks or blogs. The shadow network is in fact the CONVERSATION that links similar topics and subject words and presents them as CONVERSATIONS...or conversation playlists.

Background: MemeSpeak is a Cloud based conversational social network system that turns text messages into speaking faces. The link to avatar faces engaged in CONVERSATIONS can then be posted to social networks, blogs or sent in text messages (e.g. WhatsAPP) in place of text messaging or text blogging. The system supports multiple language text inputs and natural language audio outputs in English, French, Spanish, German, Polish, Portuguese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Vietnamese, Russian, Italian, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, Arabic and Czech. Think of it as WhatsAPP, but with video messaging longer than 10 seconds...in fact, potentially much longer because the video itself is not transmitted

The system can support hundreds of thousands of concurrent mobile or PC video clients and/or creators. Viewers do not need to be members of MemeSpeak™ to view the conversations on social networks or blogs. Any mobile platform with an internet browser can use the MemeSpeak™ system.
Globally, the website will appear in multiple Unicode-supported languages. The system can be scaled and hosted on Cloud networks to support 100,000's of concurrent viewers.
The animations, created through text-to-speech on the MemeSpeak™ website, which has most of the features of YouTube, allow users to create the animations and connect them through dynamic ""learning"" playlists of textual (and emotional) memes (which are automatically hash tagged) – then, they are distributed freely among friends or members of any existing social networks Facebook, Twitter, etc – only the textual links to the animations are shared or transmitted. (In fact, any social network can utilize generic avatar episodes or the novel MemeSpeak™ playlist pages can be embedded.) The meme tags are also searchable, unlike most blog commentary, through Google, etc. and evolve through SEO.
The MemeSpeak platform system is already available on cloud servers for PC and mobile users at www.memespeaker.com. IPhone and an Android APPS (""memespeaktheapp"" ) which interface to the cloud system are free and available on iTunes and Google Play. However, the APPS are not necessary for a mobile connection which can be handled through any mobile browser on any handset in all of the supported languages.http://www.memespeaker.com/FAQ.html

<p><b>Q:</b> What Chip does the Gidjit Beacon use?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Gidjit Beacons use a Nordic NRF51822 Chip</p>
<p><b>Q: </b>What happens when you have two (or more) Gidjit Beacons within a close range of each other? Will both of the panels which list the assigned Smart Devices and other Apps be displayed in the Gidjit App?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Yes, if your phone is within range of more than one Gidjit Beacon, the panels relating to those Beacons will be displayed (With the closest Beacon listed first). You can always adjust the broadcast range of one of the Beacons if you do not want them both displayed from that location. </p>
<p><b>Q: </b>Did your team develop the Gidjit Beacon?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> No, after testing numerous Beacons from various manufacturers, we were able to successfully alter a Beacon manufactured by Minew Tech. to work best with the Gidjit app. </p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Will other Beacons work with the Gidjit app?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Not at this time. The reason being is that we are trying to raise funds in order to cover the overhead associated with further developing the Gidjit app. HOWEVER, the UUID, Major, Minor, etc. of the Gidjit Beacons can be  changed if you wish to use with a different application.</p>

<p><strong><span>About Us</span></strong></p>
<span><span><p>Cyber Privacy Project (CPP)  protects privacy rights at risk in today's Internet, technology-driven, and social media world.  It upholds privacy rights as fundamental to our democratic society by realizing the potential of the privacy protections in the U.S. Constitution and laws.  CPP launched its crowdfunding on Constitution Day to remind us of the stakes we all have in defending the constitutional rights for protecting privacy.  Supporting CPP supports privacy.<br/></p>
<p>In upholding privacy as a fundamental constitutional right, CPP upholds privacy protections based in First Amendment rights of privacy and anonymity, Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and protecting liberty, and Ninth Amendment unenumerated rights.  CPP also advocates privacy principles in international human rights, state constitutions, and ethics codes. </p>
<p>CPP is notable among privacy advocates for its emphasis on how Technology can both undermine and support privacy.  Some technologies built into implementing privacy policies--like programming-in periodic purging of data--can protect personal information. In fact, privacy principles and advocacy can be considered a ""social technology"" that protects all of our rights.  In short, supporting CPP can improve the social technology of privacy protection. <br/></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Goals and Approaches</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>The Cyber Privacy Project seeks to advance privacy policy recommendations by serving as a source for the media and public debates.

</div></div>","About Us
Cyber Privacy Project (CPP)  protects privacy rights at risk in today's Internet, technology-driven, and social media world.  It upholds privacy rights as fundamental to our democratic society by realizing the potential of the privacy protections in the U.S. Constitution and laws.  CPP launched its crowdfunding on Constitution Day to remind us of the stakes we all have in defending the constitutional rights for protecting privacy.  Supporting CPP supports privacy.
In upholding privacy as a fundamental constitutional right, CPP upholds privacy protections based in First Amendment rights of privacy and anonymity, Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and protecting liberty, and Ninth Amendment unenumerated rights.  CPP also advocates privacy principles in international human rights, state constitutions, and ethics codes. 
CPP is notable among privacy advocates for its emphasis on how Technology can both undermine and support privacy.  Some technologies built into implementing privacy policies--like programming-in periodic purging of data--can protect personal information. In fact, privacy principles and advocacy can be considered a ""social technology"" that protects all of our rights.  In short, supporting CPP can improve the social technology of privacy protection.

CPP Amicus Brief in the Wisconsin Voter ID Case: Full Text

Why is CPP Using Crowd Funding?   



First, preserving privacy is important for everybody: Walking outside in a crowd used to be a chance for anonymity and privacy. Now with facial recognition surveillance technology, everyone's privacy can be compromised.
Second, privacy is pricey to protect.  Like preserving freedom, protecting privacy isn't free, and needs support to pursue actively.

Third, few foundations and funding organizations support privacy projects.

Fourth, CPP is  asked to submit amicus (""Friend of the Court"") briefs on significant constitutional issues that require multiple hours of research, analysis and writing. Because of their scope, fast timing, and court requirements, briefs are some of the hardest projects to fund on a timely basis.
Fifth, CPP helps educate interns about privacy issue, thus, helping to develop future privacy experts and advocates.

<p>Our SelfieBot is based on a small size arduino and
uses 2 powerful servos to hold a smartphone or a tablet. To receive signals
from the smartphone or tablet we use a bluetooth module. For a longer operation
time we added a battery with the capacity of 2 600mAh and now we are working at
a sleep function, which contains an IR sensor and will save energy when there
is nobody near by.</p>

<p>A lot of similar projects on kickstarter and indiegogo
did not take off or had some difficulties with that. Endurance have already
taken off, we just need some help and an additional lift to fly faster. We will
make this solution much cheaper than the similar solution of the current

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><b>1.  What operating systems and
devices does the SelfieBot support?</b></p>
<p><b>Currently</b>
SelfieBot supports only Android devices. But we are working on iOS and Windows
support. We plan to support them before the end of September 2015.</p>
<p><b>2.  What powers the SelfieBot? </b></p>
<p>It uses
Li-ion 2600mAh battery and can work up to 4 hoursand even charge your mobile
device. We are going to make models, which will use batteries with 5200mAh
capacity or bigger. The SelfieBot ispowered from AC power supply through a
compatible. The SelfieBot is equipped
now with a special controller to check the current, which will turn it off if
needed. It is built in the battery block.</p>
<p><b>3.  Does the SelfieBot cost 150 USD? What is a ""full commercial SelfieBot license,"" as advertised on your Indiegogo page?</b><br/></p>
<p>For our Indiegogo campaign we made
a special price of 150 USD. Later on the price will be around  200-250 USD.</p>
<p>We also offer a SelfieBot made
after a customer’s design, at the price of 500 USD.</p>
<p>Under the full commercial
SelfieBot  license we mean a nonexclusive
license we’ll give to a contributor who gives us 20,000 USD provided he/she
wants it.</p>
<p><b>4.  Does the SelfieBot come with
the white stand, as can be seen in </b><a href=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439371460/htchswjqdolmmscovcu7.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b><span>this photo</span></b></a><b>?</b></p>
<p>Actually, we are working at
several designs. The device will come with a black, white and even transparent
stands, + a hacker pack (without a stand).</p>
<p><b>5. How do you see the SelfieBot helping people with disabilities?</b></p>
<p>In fact, this model is a part of
another project of ours - telepresence robot. The SelfieBot will help them be
always in touch with their caregivers and dear ones and vice versa. When you
call the SelfieBot it connects you automatically with your interlocutor. He/she
does not need to do anything to answer your call. You can see and hear them at
once. It is convenient for a disabled person might not be always able to answer
your call himself/herself. With this device they will never feel alone.</p>
<p><b>6. On your Indiegogo page, it says: ""SelfieBot rotates your mobile
device on 2 axes tracking your movements."" What part of the bot, exactly,
rotates the mobile device? Can you send a video of this in action?</b></p>
<p>Here it is the link: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmr-Qeb4wgk"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmr-Qeb4wgk</span></a>.  The cradle (holder) rotates your mobile
device.</p>
<p><b>7. When will you start shipping the SelfieBot to customers? When will
the Indiegogo campaign end?</b></p>
<p>The Indiegogo campaign will end on
the 24 of September 2015 and we plan to start shipping our units to our backers
in October 2015.</p>
<p><b>8. How do you control the SelfieBot? (Remote control, buttons on the
device, or what?)</b></p>
<p>Either manually, using the
transparent buttons on the screen of another mobile device (tablet or
smartphone), or automatically, using the “follow me” function. We also plan to
make it possible to control the SelfieBot remotely using the accelerometer of your
mobile device. You will rotate your cell phone being far away from the
SelfieBot, and it will rotate in the direction you choose.</p>
<p><b>9. What do you mean by “transparent buttons on the screen of another
mobile device""?</b></p>
<p>Transparent buttons appear on the
screen of your device when you run Skype or Hangouts; using them you can rotate
the  SelfieBot.You can you see it here: <a href=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439631307/xepbchybiytufmafp3gs.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439631307/xepbchybiytufmafp3gs.jpg</span></a></p>
<p><b>10. What exactly does the ‘follow me” function do? Does it exist right
now?</b></p>
<p>The “follow me” function makes the
SelfieBot turn after the user if he/she moves around while using the device.
The function does exist.</p>
<p><b>11. Do you have to download the SelfieBot app to use the follow me/
facial recognition functions?</b></p>
<p>Yes, you have to download the
SelfieBot app to the device you mount on the SelfieBot. Otherwise how can the
SelfieBot automatically log the facial recognition, if you use FaceTime or
Skype? So you download the SelfieBot app, run it, and make a connection with
the SelfieBot via bluetooth protocol. Your mobile gadget sends signals to the
SelfieBot, in which direction to rotate. And no special apps are needed for the
devices of SelfieBot's interlocutors.</p>
<p><b>12. Is there a SelfieBot app currently available to users?</b></p>
<p>Yes.  You can find it here: <a href=""https://github.com/deadtr/Selfiebot"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://github.com/deadtr/Selfiebot</span></a></p>
<p><b>13. ill software be available  only on the Google play store, or
iOS/Microsoft as well?</b></p>
<p><b>Currently, our App is available for </b> Android only. Windows and iOS will be ready a
bit later.</p>
<p><b>14. Do users have to download a separate app on another device to
control the SelfieBot?</b></p>
<p>Not on another device but on the
one they use to contact the SelfieBot. So you mount one device on the SelfieBot
and another person calls you using his/her device. If your caller wants to
control your SelfieBot he/she needs to download our app; if he/she does not
want to control the SelfieBot and is happy with the “follow me” function he/she
will not need any additional apps.</p>
<p><b>15.  How long does the robot's
battery last without charging?</b></p>
<p>Several hours. We plan to increase
it up to 24.</p>
<p><b>16. What happens if two people (the caller and the receiver) have
downloaded the SelfieBot app to control the bot? What if they give conflicting
instructions?</b></p>
<p>A great point. You can select who
controls the SelfieBot. There is a select mode.</p>
<p><b>17. And, just to be clear, how many different ways are there to control
the mobile device? ""Control"" meaning switching on and off, rotating
the device, etc.</b></p>
<p>Two ways: manual and automatic.
You can control the SelfieBot from any other device: PC, smartphone or tablet. </p>
<p><b>18. Apart from rotating the cradle so that the smartphone can follow the
user around, does the SelfieBot have other functions?</b></p>
<p>Quite a lot.  </p>

<p><b>19.  Just to be clear, will the

<p>Yes, we hope it will be even
sooner.  </p>
<p><b>20.  How can you decide whether
you want the robot to be stationary (rooted), controlled by another device, or
move automatically?</b></p>
<p>It depends on what you do. If you
talk to someone in the kitchen then you’ll probably want the SelfieBot to move
after you (“follow me” function). If you talk to someone at a business meeting
then you’ll probably prefer to move it yourself (manual mode). </p>
<p><b>21.  How do you <u>switch</u>
between making the SelfieBot stationary, controlled, or on ""follow
me"" mode?</b></p>
<p>When you run a Selfiebot you run
an app on its local mobile device. When connected to the SelfieBot you can
choose the manual mode or the “follow me” function mode.</p>
<p><b>22. Can you  switch off the
""follow me"" function? </b></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><b>23. If so, how?</b></p>
<p>Just take it off from a checkbox.</p>
<p><b>24. Is there a password before you connect to a particular SelfieBot?
Can people hack into others' SelfieBots and control their directions?</b></p>
<p>You have your Mac address and your
personal SelfieBot name so if you use our server you know where to connect to.</p>
<p><b>25. Can people hack into others' SelfieBots and control their
directions?</b></p>
<p>We take security seriously, and
make sure that SeflieBot as secure as possible. but we do not think that it is
something people would like to hack. You have to hack someone’s smartphone first.</p>
<p><b>26.  Regarding the face tracking
function -- will the robot be programmed to recognize one user's face, or any?
Will it be able to move when anyone in the frame is moving around (e.g. babies,
people in your apartment when you are away, etc.)?</b></p>
<p>Once you started talking to
someone it remembers you and then will track you. Actually, you can change the
person to be followed if you wish ad hoc but more likely you will have to
re-start the “follow me” function.</p>
<p><b>27. Do you have to download the SelfieBot app to use the follow me/
facial recognition functions? Because if you're using FaceTime or Skype, how
can the SelfieBot automatically log the facial recognition?</b></p>
<p>Once the SelfieBot recognizes you
it will track your movements... even if someone else is in the frame, it will
still follow you. </p>
<p><b>28. Can the SelfieBot ""forget"" what you look like and stop
tracking you?</b></p>
<p>No, it cannot forget you during
the call and will track you till the end of the call even if somebody else is
nearby.</p>
<p><b>29. Once the SelfieBot's app (the app, not actual robot, right?)
recognizes your face, when will it forget your face? Only until the end of the
conversation, or forever? Only the app you are using will remember your face,
right? If a stranger downloads SelfieBot's app, will they know my face?</b></p>
<p>Nope. It is for local application
only.  No face recognition or face
database. After you stop the conversation and disconnect the “follow me”
function. The “follow me” function will be working for one session. Only until
the end of the conversation. </p>
<p><b>30. What happens in the ""follow me"" feature if there are
multiple people in the frame? Who does the facial recognition feature track?</b></p>
<p>It will follow the leader, the one
who is closer to the camera.</p>
<p><b>31. How big is the SelfieBot (measurements) and how heavy?</b></p>
<p>It’s about 7-8 inch high and 1.5-2
pounds weight.</p>
<p><b>32. Which parts of the SelfieBot are 3D-printed?</b></p>
<p>Everything what you see outside is
fully 3D-printed!</p>
<p><b>33. Is the SelfieBot app available on desktop and tablet?</b></p>
<p>Right now only the Android version
is available <a href=""https://github.com/deadtr/SelfieBot/releases"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://github.com/deadtr/SelfieBot/releases</span></a></p>
<p>but we hope to make an html web
page on our server to allow access to the SelfieBot, which is in Moscow.</p>
<p><b>34. I don't use an Android device so unfortunately cannot download
SelfieBot's app, unfortunately.</b></p>
<p>Surely, you use iPhone, do you? We
will make it for iOS in the middle of September.</p>
<p>Actually you can download our app
and connect to the SelfieBot remotely <a href=""https://github.com/deadtr/SelfieBot/releases"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://github.com/deadtr/SelfieBot/releases</span></a></p>
<p><b>35. You also mention that users use the app connect to particular
SelfieBots via bluetooth.</b></p>
<p>Exactly. To pair the SelfieBot
with your mobile gadget you have to use bluetooth connection since your WiFi
can be busy.</p>
<p><b>36. If I'm an interlocutor connecting to your SelfieBot remotely, how
far does the bluetooth work?</b></p>
<p>Normally,  if you are far away you connect using our
server. Bluetooth connection is used to pair a SelfieBot with a mobile device
(a cell phone or a tablet).</p>
<p><b>37. Would I be able to connect to a SelfieBot from any country<b>?</b></b></p>
<b>
</b><p>By all means. You may try it
anytime when I am in our office.</p>

Risks & Challenges




On AlphaCamp 2015


Loss of functionality. Other platforms may not support the transparent
interface designed for Android.
We plan to: 



Add an additional Bluetooth
module, compatible with the new standards of communication.


Make it possible to exchange
data via USB.


Make a more detailed study of
API.


Add  an accelerometer  control function.


Add the Face Recognition

Hurdles: 



What kind of servo is the best
for our SelfieBot? 


How long will the servos work
fail-safe and under what conditions? 


How long will the battery work
without recharging and what capacity is perfect for us?


What voltage range is the most
optimal for the correct work of SelfieBot?





Ways to clear them:



Testing different servos, we
will find the most perfect one (spell of service, max weight, voltage and min.
price) for the smart SelfieBot.


Testing servos in different
machines under various conditions.


Testing the SelfieBot operation
with batteries of different capacity.

Testing the SelfieBot endurance
under critical conditions (e.g. with a higher voltage battery.

More:


Crash tests of SelfieBot.


Search for the optimal
price-quality solution.








Our financial goal




We are raising 20,000 USD to make 100 units and ship them to all our
contributors. Endurance has about 10 people working full time and all of them
work without salary. We are proud of it. Indeed, they are very motivated and
focused. We need 20,000 USD to make beta shipments and  do some R&D.
We are inviting everyone interested in robotics to support the young
entrepreneur team. It is important for us to enter the market and get feedbacks
from our customers. 

Perks


5 USD
We put your name on our “thank
you list”.
25 USD
We make a personal card with
an engraved ""thank you"" message. Engraved with our Endurance L-Cheapo
diode laser. Something like this.
100 USD
We ship you a hacker pack
(microchips, servos and sketches to make your own SelfieBot on a 3D printer).




So you can make your own selfybot and even more!



150 USD
We ship you a SelfieBot





250 USD
We ship you a SelfieBot family
/ office pack (2 units). Save 16.6% on pre-order
500 USD
We can create and send you a SelfieBot
with a unique design.
20,000 USD

We give you a full commercial
SelfieBot license.




If we don't
reach entire goal



If we do not reach the entire goal we will still
continue with R&D and shipments. We’ve already raised 5K USD (off Indiegogo)
from angel investors. 
Meanwhile, as part of R&D
we plan to modify SelfieBot + do some tests:



Test various
solutions concerning energy consumption.


Do crash tests
and test it under critical conditions.


Search for a
better quality-price solution using different batteries and servos.


Acquire more
equipment to increase mass production (now it takes us 1 week to make 1
SelfieBot).


Improve the software stability.


Our SelfieBot is based on a small size arduino and
uses 2 powerful servos to hold a smartphone or a tablet. To receive signals
from the smartphone or tablet we use a bluetooth module. For a longer operation
time we added a battery with the capacity of 2 600mAh and now we are working at
a sleep function, which contains an IR sensor and will save energy when there
is nobody near by.


The Impact
The Endurance project is an
assembly of very smart engineer folks, mostly students from the top Russian
tech universities. 



SelfieBot Team


We want to bring civilian robots into our life to make
it easier. Making SelfieBot for a smartphone and tablets, we help make video
phone calls and selfie videos easier and provide you with a perfect dock for your
mobile device. Now you can turn your mobile gadget into a WiFi camera very
easily.

A lot of similar projects on kickstarter and indiegogo
did not take off or had some difficulties with that. Endurance have already
taken off, we just need some help and an additional lift to fly faster. We will
make this solution much cheaper than the similar solution of the current
competitors and we will create a perfect “follow me” function.
Confidence

Endurance is a very open
company. We neither keep it secret nor try to hide anything.
We make a youtube webcast
channel when our developers come and discuss problems (see it on YouTube)
You can email me as many
question as you want. Normally, I reply to everyone and have about 100 outgoing
messages a day.

FAQ
1.  What operating systems and
devices does the SelfieBot support?
Currently
SelfieBot supports only Android devices. But we are working on iOS and Windows
support. We plan to support them before the end of September 2015.
2.  What powers the SelfieBot? 
It uses
Li-ion 2600mAh battery and can work up to 4 hoursand even charge your mobile
device. We are going to make models, which will use batteries with 5200mAh
capacity or bigger. The SelfieBot ispowered from AC power supply through a
compatible. The SelfieBot is equipped
now with a special controller to check the current, which will turn it off if
needed. It is built in the battery block.
3.  Does the SelfieBot cost 150 USD? What is a ""full commercial SelfieBot license,"" as advertised on your Indiegogo page?
For our Indiegogo campaign we made
a special price of 150 USD. Later on the price will be around  200-250 USD.
We also offer a SelfieBot made
after a customer’s design, at the price of 500 USD.
Under the full commercial
SelfieBot  license we mean a nonexclusive
license we’ll give to a contributor who gives us 20,000 USD provided he/she
wants it.
4.  Does the SelfieBot come with
the white stand, as can be seen in this photo?
Actually, we are working at
several designs. The device will come with a black, white and even transparent
stands, + a hacker pack (without a stand).
5. How do you see the SelfieBot helping people with disabilities?
In fact, this model is a part of
another project of ours - telepresence robot. The SelfieBot will help them be
always in touch with their caregivers and dear ones and vice versa. When you
call the SelfieBot it connects you automatically with your interlocutor. He/she
does not need to do anything to answer your call. You can see and hear them at
once. It is convenient for a disabled person might not be always able to answer
your call himself/herself. With this device they will never feel alone.
6. On your Indiegogo page, it says: ""SelfieBot rotates your mobile
device on 2 axes tracking your movements."" What part of the bot, exactly,
rotates the mobile device? Can you send a video of this in action?
Here it is the link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmr-Qeb4wgk.  The cradle (holder) rotates your mobile
device.
7. When will you start shipping the SelfieBot to customers? When will
the Indiegogo campaign end?
The Indiegogo campaign will end on
the 24 of September 2015 and we plan to start shipping our units to our backers
in October 2015.
8. How do you control the SelfieBot? (Remote control, buttons on the
device, or what?)
Either manually, using the
transparent buttons on the screen of another mobile device (tablet or
smartphone), or automatically, using the “follow me” function. We also plan to
make it possible to control the SelfieBot remotely using the accelerometer of your
mobile device. You will rotate your cell phone being far away from the
SelfieBot, and it will rotate in the direction you choose.
9. What do you mean by “transparent buttons on the screen of another
mobile device""?
Transparent buttons appear on the
screen of your device when you run Skype or Hangouts; using them you can rotate
the  SelfieBot.You can you see it here: https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439631307/xepbchybiytufmafp3gs.jpg
10. What exactly does the ‘follow me” function do? Does it exist right
now?
The “follow me” function makes the
SelfieBot turn after the user if he/she moves around while using the device.
The function does exist.
11. Do you have to download the SelfieBot app to use the follow me/
facial recognition functions?
Yes, you have to download the
SelfieBot app to the device you mount on the SelfieBot. Otherwise how can the
SelfieBot automatically log the facial recognition, if you use FaceTime or
Skype? So you download the SelfieBot app, run it, and make a connection with
the SelfieBot via bluetooth protocol. Your mobile gadget sends signals to the
SelfieBot, in which direction to rotate. And no special apps are needed for the
devices of SelfieBot's interlocutors.
12. Is there a SelfieBot app currently available to users?
Yes.  You can find it here: https://github.com/deadtr/Selfiebot
13. ill software be available  only on the Google play store, or
iOS/Microsoft as well?
Currently, our App is available for  Android only. Windows and iOS will be ready a
bit later.
14. Do users have to download a separate app on another device to
control the SelfieBot?
Not on another device but on the
one they use to contact the SelfieBot. So you mount one device on the SelfieBot
and another person calls you using his/her device. If your caller wants to
control your SelfieBot he/she needs to download our app; if he/she does not
want to control the SelfieBot and is happy with the “follow me” function he/she
will not need any additional apps.
15.  How long does the robot's
battery last without charging?
Several hours. We plan to increase
it up to 24.
16. What happens if two people (the caller and the receiver) have
downloaded the SelfieBot app to control the bot? What if they give conflicting
instructions?
A great point. You can select who
controls the SelfieBot. There is a select mode.
17. And, just to be clear, how many different ways are there to control
the mobile device? ""Control"" meaning switching on and off, rotating
the device, etc.
Two ways: manual and automatic.
You can control the SelfieBot from any other device: PC, smartphone or tablet. 
18. Apart from rotating the cradle so that the smartphone can follow the
user around, does the SelfieBot have other functions?
Quite a lot.  



SelfieBot on/off;


infrared lighning on / off;


“follow me” function on/off.


Movement sensors on / off.


19.  Just to be clear, will the
iOS, Windows, web versions of the app all be completed by the time you start
shipping?
Yes, we hope it will be even
sooner.  
20.  How can you decide whether
you want the robot to be stationary (rooted), controlled by another device, or
move automatically?
It depends on what you do. If you
talk to someone in the kitchen then you’ll probably want the SelfieBot to move
after you (“follow me” function). If you talk to someone at a business meeting
then you’ll probably prefer to move it yourself (manual mode). 
21.  How do you switch
between making the SelfieBot stationary, controlled, or on ""follow
me"" mode?
When you run a Selfiebot you run
an app on its local mobile device. When connected to the SelfieBot you can
choose the manual mode or the “follow me” function mode.
22. Can you  switch off the
""follow me"" function? 
Yes.
23. If so, how?
Just take it off from a checkbox.
24. Is there a password before you connect to a particular SelfieBot?
Can people hack into others' SelfieBots and control their directions?
You have your Mac address and your
personal SelfieBot name so if you use our server you know where to connect to.
25. Can people hack into others' SelfieBots and control their
directions?
We take security seriously, and
make sure that SeflieBot as secure as possible. but we do not think that it is
something people would like to hack. You have to hack someone’s smartphone first.
26.  Regarding the face tracking
function -- will the robot be programmed to recognize one user's face, or any?
Will it be able to move when anyone in the frame is moving around (e.g. babies,
people in your apartment when you are away, etc.)?
Once you started talking to
someone it remembers you and then will track you. Actually, you can change the
person to be followed if you wish ad hoc but more likely you will have to
re-start the “follow me” function.
27. Do you have to download the SelfieBot app to use the follow me/
facial recognition functions? Because if you're using FaceTime or Skype, how
can the SelfieBot automatically log the facial recognition?
Once the SelfieBot recognizes you
it will track your movements... even if someone else is in the frame, it will
still follow you. 
28. Can the SelfieBot ""forget"" what you look like and stop
tracking you?
No, it cannot forget you during
the call and will track you till the end of the call even if somebody else is
nearby.
29. Once the SelfieBot's app (the app, not actual robot, right?)
recognizes your face, when will it forget your face? Only until the end of the
conversation, or forever? Only the app you are using will remember your face,
right? If a stranger downloads SelfieBot's app, will they know my face?
Nope. It is for local application
only.  No face recognition or face
database. After you stop the conversation and disconnect the “follow me”
function. The “follow me” function will be working for one session. Only until
the end of the conversation. 
30. What happens in the ""follow me"" feature if there are
multiple people in the frame? Who does the facial recognition feature track?
It will follow the leader, the one
who is closer to the camera.
31. How big is the SelfieBot (measurements) and how heavy?
It’s about 7-8 inch high and 1.5-2
pounds weight.
32. Which parts of the SelfieBot are 3D-printed?
Everything what you see outside is
fully 3D-printed!
33. Is the SelfieBot app available on desktop and tablet?
Right now only the Android version
is available https://github.com/deadtr/SelfieBot/releases
but we hope to make an html web
page on our server to allow access to the SelfieBot, which is in Moscow.
34. I don't use an Android device so unfortunately cannot download
SelfieBot's app, unfortunately.
Surely, you use iPhone, do you? We
will make it for iOS in the middle of September.
Actually you can download our app
and connect to the SelfieBot remotely https://github.com/deadtr/SelfieBot/releases
35. You also mention that users use the app connect to particular
SelfieBots via bluetooth.
Exactly. To pair the SelfieBot
with your mobile gadget you have to use bluetooth connection since your WiFi
can be busy.
36. If I'm an interlocutor connecting to your SelfieBot remotely, how
far does the bluetooth work?
Normally,  if you are far away you connect using our
server. Bluetooth connection is used to pair a SelfieBot with a mobile device
(a cell phone or a tablet).
37. Would I be able to connect to a SelfieBot from any country?

By all means. You may try it
anytime when I am in our office.

<h3>WHY LYNQ ?</h3>
<p><b>ARE YOU READY FOR THE USB-C REVOLUTION?</b> The latest and upcoming models of Apple's MacBook, and other PC' Laptops are getting thinner and manufacturers are moving away from the larger USB (Type A) connector to the smaller, USB (Type C) connector. This makes many of the existing devices we own unable to easily connect to the newer computers. Plus, these thinner laptops lack many of the extra ports we need like SD card readers, video output and more. LYNQ is design to ease the transition to the newer USB Type-C equipped computers and give you all the ports you need to connect with the devices you already own.<span><br/></span></p>
<p>Dollar for dollar, LYNQ offers more ports than the Apple AV Multi-port adapter designed for the MacBook 12"". Plus, early bird supporters can take advantage of LYNQ early bird pricing at only $75!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466009793/LYNQ_apple_compare_c34ast.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>HELP US MAKE LYNQ A REALITY</h3>
<p>We've been working hard to make LYNQ the best multi-port expansion hub. We believe that many customers of new MacBooks and similar PCs will be left without the support to connect to the devices they already own. We've spent the last few months engineering and testing all of LYNQ's components to ensure the product is stable, efficient and reliable. Now, we need to raise enough funds to cover final tooling, certification and minimum production. By supporting LYNQ, we can raise enough money to make LYNQ a reality and bring the ports back to your MacBook.</p>

CONNECT TO ALL THE DEVICES YOU ALREADY OWN AND MORE.


MEET THE PORTS

LYNQ gives you all the ports you need to connect to the devices you love.

 



CONNECT MORE

LYNQ gives you 3 extra powered USB ports that lets you connect printers, portable hard-drives, keyboard, MIDI instruments, thumb drives and more! Plus, you can charge your iPhone.






ACCESS MORE (SD/MicroSD)

LYNQ has a standard SD and a micro SD card reader built in. You can access high capacity (HC) and extra capacity XC cards up to 2 Terabyte.  You can also keep your high-capacity micro-SD card installed and turn LYNQ into portable USB-C backup drive for your laptop.





SEE MORE – ULTRA-HD 4K VIDEO

Get smooth, full screen HD (1080P) or Ultra-HD (2160P) with LYNQ. It mirrors or extends the video from your MacBook's USB C port to any large screen TV or  projector. It's the perfect way to share videos, presentations and more.


  


NETWORK MORE – ETHERNET
Connect to your work's secure wired network or administer network devices such as modems and routers with LYNQ's built-in Ethernet high-speed port. IT supports speeds from 10BaseT to 1000BaseT and is always there in case you ever need it.




CHARGE MORE
When connected to your MacBook, LYNQ can charge and sync your iPhone, iPad or Android devices.



CHARGE EVEN MORE

LYNQ doesn't get in the way of you charging your new MacBook. It's USB Type-C port also allows you to connect your wall charger to recharge your laptop. You can continue to use connected drives and peripherals without skipping a beat. 







WHY LYNQ ?
ARE YOU READY FOR THE USB-C REVOLUTION? The latest and upcoming models of Apple's MacBook, and other PC' Laptops are getting thinner and manufacturers are moving away from the larger USB (Type A) connector to the smaller, USB (Type C) connector. This makes many of the existing devices we own unable to easily connect to the newer computers. Plus, these thinner laptops lack many of the extra ports we need like SD card readers, video output and more. LYNQ is design to ease the transition to the newer USB Type-C equipped computers and give you all the ports you need to connect with the devices you already own.
Dollar for dollar, LYNQ offers more ports than the Apple AV Multi-port adapter designed for the MacBook 12"". Plus, early bird supporters can take advantage of LYNQ early bird pricing at only $75!






We've got most of the final engineering and testing on the way. With your support we can afford extra time and care to make LYNQ the best solution for bringing back the ports to your laptop.

<h3>A Short Overview:</h3>
<p>Most modern televisions, computers, and smartphones have screens with artificial blue light (ranging from 400-470nm) that gradually suppress melatonin and wear down eyes due to their intensity. The prolonged exposure to harsh blue light emitted from these LED screens causes health problems that can disrupt one’s daily life, such as eyestrain, headaches, dry eyes, blurred vision, migraines, and disturbed ability to sleep. In response, our team has designed a 0.3 mm thickness adhesive tempered glass screen protector with blue light UV filtering technology for phones, computers, tablets, televisions, and other devices. This screen protector protects from dust, dirt, and fingerprints as well as physical damage like scratches and cracks. It protects the eyes from excessive blue light exposure without distorting the colors on the screen. Unlike common alternatives, this screen protector will prove to be very beneficial to those doing color-sensitive work for extended periods of time, such as graphic design, drawing, and editing.</p>
<p>Maya Duff and Onastasia  Ebright are co-founders of Perfect Society, Lauren Langford is the research specialist, and JaBria Bishop is the general specialist. All four women are sophomores studying various fields at Duke University competing in the Duke Startup Challenge.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to continue making this product a reality, we need to raise $5,000 to participate in the next stage of our challenge- the Duke Startup Challenge Summer Program where we will be working full time in the startup with mentorship and gain experience in entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>This money, however, does not go towards the challenge, it only proves that our product is worth Duke's continued investment. Your contribution will help fund our ongoing research and go towards raw materials and resources needed to continue product development.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">While there are alternatives on the market, Perfect Society's tempered glass screen protectors are set apart because they do not alter the color of the screen, are simple to apply, and will provide protection for your device from hard drops, scratches, and liquids. We expect to keep the price reasonable, between $7.95 and $25.95, depending on the size of the screen.</span></p>

</h3>
<p>For a blue light filter, we have designed a tempered glass screen protector equipped with UV filtering technology that will absorb the artificial blue light and prevent it from penetrating too far into the retina. We intend to manufacture the screen covers with dimensions for the most popular device brands and products on the market, but we will also encourage consumers to customize dimensions for their other devices.</p>
<p>This screen cover will be affordable, durable, and effective. The benefits of better sleep, preserved eye health, and protected melatonin levels will make this product worth its cost.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge for our product is that not enough people are aware of the severity of this problem. Many people are aware of the potential of negative health issues when using electronic devices yet tend to overlook them. However, if they were alerted to the actual consequences of prolonged exposure to blue light, they would search for an easy solution, as the only other alternative would be trying to avoid spending more than two hours at a time on electronic devices with LED screens, which is nearly impossible in this day and age. Our solution will be to increase awareness through social media campaigns and advertisements starting in business and university communities.</p>

<h3>Iphone to Printer Cloud Device</h3>
<p>Print Pass founders started Print Pass after traveling the world and struggling to print out their flight boarding passes at each hotel. Hotel printers are the worst and not even one of them was easy to use. It took over 15 minutes to print one boarding pass. Another aspect they disliked is handing over their password to every computer, and not knowing what hotels are doing with that information. Another issue they faced is printing at the office. Every time they tried to print on a new floor or from a new device it seemed they had to contact technical support. So Print Pass was created, which allows for no hassle when printing from any device any where in the world.  </p>

Meet the ZUS Super Duty Cable, the world's first cable with a Lifetime Guarantee. Choose from 3 cable options when you back us: lightning, micro USB, or USB-C to USB. Check out below how people have stress-tested the ZUS Cable. What Our Backers Are Saying  

The ZUS Cable is aramid fiber reinforced for superior strength. 
What is aramid fiber? It's the stuff that bulletproof vests are made of. It's the stuff that allowed Curiosity to survive 65,000 pounds of force on its descent to Mars. With aramid fiber, the ZUS Cable can handle being crushed or tossed around.
 

In a third-party test conducted by German test lab, TÜV, the ZUS Cable bent over 15,000 times, that's 50% more than the more expensive brand Belkin.


 


With a unique 90-degree plug, the ZUS Super Duty Cable is adept at fitting in narrow spaces. It also pairs perfectly with the ZUS Smart Car Charger for on-the-road charging.

Due to popular demand, we're now offering a straight USB version of our ZUS lightning cable, which you can select on the survey that will be sent to you 10 days after your purchase date.

 
 


The tough nylon braiding material keeps the ZUS Cable inherently tangle-free. Each cable also comes with a complementary velcro tie to keep things further organized.

<h4><br/></h4><h3>
<b>Summary</b><br/>
</h3><p>There is no need to add anything to the horrific
images that reached all of us about the refugee crisis. Thousands upon thousands of people trying to escape
from war, which makes them risking their lives and the lives of their loved ones
seeking  to live in peace. </p>
<p>Theirs is an exasperating situation,
and when they finally reach a new destination, they have to start all over
again trying to get some food, a roof for shelter, and find a charger for their
cell phone so they can be somehow connected.<span>  </span></p>
<p>They desperately try to talk to their relatives, to  someone
they can tell they made it, that they reached firm ground and they are safe.
They also depend on their cell phones in order to access useful and often vital
information in real time, and to<span>  exchange
information and advice about how to go on, which road to take, how transportation
works, or simply just to find a place to rest.</span> As they say:<b> “A good pair of shoes, a sleeping bag and
a smartphone is just about all we need for this journey.” </b>This is why it<b>´</b>s vital for them to have full battery
charge during the whole day.
</p><p><b>With this
campaign I propose a solution to this problem.</b> This is one of the main
difficulties the refugees have face daily and which is almost vital for their
physical integrity, for after traveling hundreds of
kilometers on foot with their families, old people and children amongst them,
and the few belongings with in order to
make it safely to their destination.<span> 
</span></p>
<p>I call on you to
contribute with whatever you can so that we can <b>get a solar battery charger to for each refugee so that his/her mobile phone can be operational at
anytime.<span> (See in the gallery)</span></b></p>
<p>This way, they
will be able to use the GPS, find the right roads and maps, communicate with
their fellow countrymen while informing others what is going on during the
journey and most important, to be able to be in contact with their families in
foreign countries. </p>
<p>We don’t have
much time left , thousands and thousands of people arrive each day, if we want to help we must do it now!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3><b>How will we do
it?</b></h3>
<p>We will ship the
solar chargers straight to Greece, which as of today is the main arriving spot
for these refugees, to a distribution center. We will coordinate delivery
together with several NGO’s and
International agencies present there at the moment.</p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3><b>What do we need <br/></b></h3>
<p>The first <b>main
goal is to raise $100.000 </b>in order to deliver at least 6000 solar chargers. <br/></p>
<p>100% of the raised money will be destined to the purchase of the solar chargers directly to
the manufacturers, and it will cover the costs of shipping, importing, customs
duties and delivery to the several distribution points.<span>                                      *All
documents will be deposited with a Notary Public to guarantee the
transparency of this campaign.

           <br/></span></p><p>The more money
we raise the more chargers we will be able to deliver, and more people we will
help. There is no limit, the limit is just only what each one is willing and able to
contribute.</p>
<p>Unused funds
will be destined to charities involved in helping refugees.<span>  </span></p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3><b>How can you
help?</b></h3>
<p>By donating

Summary
There is no need to add anything to the horrific
images that reached all of us about the refugee crisis. Thousands upon thousands of people trying to escape
from war, which makes them risking their lives and the lives of their loved ones
seeking  to live in peace. 
Theirs is an exasperating situation,
and when they finally reach a new destination, they have to start all over
again trying to get some food, a roof for shelter, and find a charger for their
cell phone so they can be somehow connected.  
They desperately try to talk to their relatives, to  someone
they can tell they made it, that they reached firm ground and they are safe.
They also depend on their cell phones in order to access useful and often vital
information in real time, and to  exchange
information and advice about how to go on, which road to take, how transportation
works, or simply just to find a place to rest. As they say: “A good pair of shoes, a sleeping bag and
a smartphone is just about all we need for this journey.” This is why it´s vital for them to have full battery
charge during the whole day.
With this
campaign I propose a solution to this problem. This is one of the main
difficulties the refugees have face daily and which is almost vital for their
physical integrity, for after traveling hundreds of
kilometers on foot with their families, old people and children amongst them,
and the few belongings with in order to
make it safely to their destination. 

I call on you to
contribute with whatever you can so that we can get a solar battery charger to for each refugee so that his/her mobile phone can be operational at
anytime. (See in the gallery)
This way, they
will be able to use the GPS, find the right roads and maps, communicate with
their fellow countrymen while informing others what is going on during the
journey and most important, to be able to be in contact with their families in
foreign countries. 
We don’t have
much time left , thousands and thousands of people arrive each day, if we want to help we must do it now!

How will we do
it?
We will ship the
solar chargers straight to Greece, which as of today is the main arriving spot
for these refugees, to a distribution center. We will coordinate delivery
together with several NGO’s and
International agencies present there at the moment.
What do we need 
The first main
goal is to raise $100.000 in order to deliver at least 6000 solar chargers. 
100% of the raised money will be destined to the purchase of the solar chargers directly to
the manufacturers, and it will cover the costs of shipping, importing, customs
duties and delivery to the several distribution points.                                      *All
documents will be deposited with a Notary Public to guarantee the
transparency of this campaign.

           The more money
we raise the more chargers we will be able to deliver, and more people we will
help. There is no limit, the limit is just only what each one is willing and able to
contribute.
Unused funds
will be destined to charities involved in helping refugees.  
How can you
help?
By donating
money. But if you can not donate, you can also help us a lot!! Just spread the
word, let others know this charity campaign amongst your friends and family so
that we can reach a lot more people. You can also use the Indiegogo diffusion tools.  
My commitment 
To dedicate my time and effort so that we
together can help the refugees endure this situation they are going through and
make it less terrible with the use of technology.
Count on you!

<span>By trade I am a motion graphics/3D animator. In my spare time I am married man and father of five who likes to tinker with technology.

</div></div>","About Me:You can follow this project on Facebook at:https://www.facebook.com/bsides3.photoscan

By trade I am a motion graphics/3D animator. In my spare time I am married man and father of five who likes to tinker with technology. I spend many evenings learning new techniques and ways to incorporate them into my daily workflow. I have been tinkering with 3D scanning for over a year now, and think I have come up with a more affordable solution than what is available currently. The design will be cheaper than the pi3Dscan by half and the quality will be better. The setup will be portable and wireless.

Campaign Goals:



Design a more affordable photogrammetry rig based off of existing technology. Current high end rigs range in prices of well over $100,000.00, while consumer grade rigs range in prices around $10,000.00. My rig will be less than $5000 to create.

The goal is to create an initial rig with 36 cameras. If the amount raised is more than the original $1500 the extra money will be used for more cameras. 
The design will be able to be charged, making the rig portable and wireless unlike the current solutions in the market.
After the initial build, the rig will only take a couple minutes to set up and collapse down for storage.
The design is also scale-able to fit various needs.
Once the goal of $5000 is raised to fund the full 100 camera rig, I will launch a website with access to the 3D scans it generates.

Our founders have spent more than 90 years collectively as technology professionals.  We believe that consumers need to have access to technology that can protect their fundamental rights to privacy and the pursuit of a secure Internet experience.  We founded SafeJunction to develop and market products that protect the privileged data including private documents and files that are shared between you and your friends, relatives, and business associates.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Campaign Description:</b><br/></p><p>Our ""Document Privacy When You Want It"" campaign is launched to fund SafeShare-One, our first commercial privacy product - an app that can be easily installed on your computer or smart device that privatizes a file, photo, video, or other object of your choice.  It encrypts it and creates a digitally encrypted “pouch” that can be transmitted anywhere to whomever you wish, whatever location you choose, using whatever transfer means you select. </p><p>The SafeJunction Digital Identity Vault Platform (DIV) is a patented, secure cloud-based identity verification system that assures that access to these privatized “pouches” is secured from prying eyes so that that the identity of those with whom you have already trusted to share can be authenticated without any additional communication on your part.  In future upgrades you will also be able to select the conditions under which the protected DIV pouches can be opened - when, where, for how long, etc.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Importance to us:</b><br/></p><p>We believe that computer and Internet users of all ages have a right to privacy and deserve the means to secure their private digital objects - files, images, videos, messages - as long as the intentions are legal and don't violate any prevailing laws, regulations, or business policies. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>What contributors will help us achieve:</b><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p>If you believe that the Edward Snowden leaks or the Hillary Clinton email controversy are any measure of the importance of digital document privacy, then you already understand the importance of what we are building.  The most sensitive documents that Snowden stole could have been protected from his access if they had been protected using SafeShare technology, although they were located in network data folders where he had clearance to get them.  Attachments located in Hillary Clinton's emails could also have been privatized similarly so that they would be protected on her servers and inaccessible in the wild.  Your own personal health data - gathered by any digital medical device and transmitted using SafeShare technology- will be privatized so that only those healthcare providers you select will be able to view it.  The databases in the cloud where your personal or business data lives might be hacked in the future, but your identity and data will remain protected while being stored anywhere and transmitted by any available means today.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>What We Need:</b><br/></p><p>We already have a working Windows demo of the first personal version of our SafeShare product (SafeShare-One).  We will make available a copy of the SafeShare-One demo to anyone interested in contributing.

We are excited to be a part of this invigorating journey and we would like you to be a part of it as well. Please take a look at exclusive and personalized perks below. This is our way of thanking you for your generous support. With your support we want to build and launch pilot fleet of vehicles which will help us gather customer feedback, pivot as necessary and validate our value proposition. We are confident that with your support we transform the way we commute.
When you help us reach our goals, we thank you with exclusive and personalized perks shown below. When you help us exceed our goals, we will give you free ride. For every dollar that we receive in 
support we give you ONE P T mile (equal to 2 km) of free ride in any Power  Tukxi . You can share your PT miles with friends and family. You will also receive exclusive access to our App and priority services on our fleet. 

















We have identified critical risks and challenges that
we will come across with our product and service as we build our organization, validate our technology, gain customer traction and build an ecosystem around them. We have outlined our plan to mitigate the same. 
Cost: We understand that
our customer segment, perhaps more than any other segment, is cost sensitive.
We understand that we need to be constantly and consistently innovate in technology,
finance sourcing and strategy domains to optimize cost of our product and
services.
Customer Support: We believe
that we have one of the toughest customer segments to serve. Our segment not
only expects world class customer service but also expects it at a much lower
price point. We understand this unique challenge and we are ready to take this
on. We believe that delighting our
customer segment with Zappo’s style customer service is critical for our
success. 
Supply Chain: Building and
sustaining supply chain is going to be daunting task and our team is very
excited to be working on it. We understand that a lean and efficient supply
chain that lies at the heart of our venture and we are confident that we can
establish it. We will hire the right talent, work with right set of industry
experts and mentors, identify and develop strategic suppliers
Quality Assurance : Our team understands that a robust engineering validation is
going to be the key for delivering product performance and customer
satisfaction. With in-house expertise and more than two decades of combined
experience we are well positioned to take on and resolve any engineering issues
we may come across. Our engineering goal is to deliver reliable product
performance with minimum unscheduled maintenance. 
Regulatory Approvals and Safety Issues: Regulatory approvals are going to be pivotal in our start up
journey. Our team understands that such approvals are not easy to obtain, time
consuming and sometimes capital intensive. We are already working with industry
leading experts who can guide and throughout the process. We are in initial
stage of engaging state and central regulatory authorities for obtaining
necessary approvals for our product.

<p></p><h3>There’s Science and Gamification Involved</h3>
<p>You Are A CEO has created an online platform and mobile app
that is built on the findings of behavioral scientists. Achieving personal
goals requires motivation, small wins, and positive reinforcement. While
motivation to achieve can get you started toward your goals, it’s habit—the
unconscious behaviors of the brain—that ultimately enables you to succeed. On
top of the science, we use principles of gamification mechanics to enable
people to create their own achievement environments while keeping themselves in
a state of achievement flow—deep huh? :-)
</p>
<p>This platform has been developed as a positive gathering
place where members forge positive habits for achievement. Members can exchange
information and inspiration to triumph through personal breakthroughs and
motivation. Now we just need to make a few final adjustments and we can unveil
this thing to the world. Would you help us? Please :-) </p>

amazing results! Through a combination of self-funding and support from a small
group of individuals who believe in the product we’ve been able to make it this
far. But we need to take You Are A CEO to the next level for our official
launch—that’s where YOU come in!

First, What is You Are A CEO?
A product development company that
creates products and provides resources that educates, encourages, and inspires
people to live an achievement lifestyle. We have created a platform to help you
make achievement a habit so it ultimately becomes easier to lead a more
fulfilling life. Other social media sites like Facebook, Google+, or Instagram
are about connecting with other people to share general information. This
platform is designed to provide motivational tools and experiences and help you
reset your thinking to apply a positive attitude to achieve your personal
goals. In this environment, it’s okay to post about all your accomplishments! Our community wants inspiration and motivation
to achieve and continue achieving.

Mobile phone radiation and health

damaged by cellular phone frequencies.” Phone radiation warnings are published
in all user manuals by law in legal section, but many users do forget to keep the phone at a safe
distance from the head or do not know about the warning. 
The effect of mobile phone radiation on human health is a subject of interest and study worldwide, as a result of the enormous increase in mobile phone usage throughout the world. As of 2016, there were 7.4 billion subscriptions worldwide (but some have more than two, so 4,230 millions users in 2014 gives better picture with then about 97 phones per 100 citizens).[1] Mobile phones use electromagnetic radiation in the microwave range (450–2100 MHz). Other digital wireless systems, such as data communication networks, produce similar radiation.
In 2011, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified mobile phone radiation as Group 2B – possibly carcinogenic (not Group 2A – probably carcinogenic – nor the dangerous Group 1). That means that there ""could be some risk"" of carcinogenicity, so additional research into the long-term, heavy use of mobile phones needs to be conducted.

As an idea, project and startup #iHELP was finalist for 2013. Top Business Idea held by Finance newspaper and were chosen among 3444 companies worldwide for WAYRA UK start up accelerator (current Alumni). iHELP project was one of the 20 chosen companies for Johnson & Johnson INNOVATION: Digital Health Master class 2013. from all the world and this year we partnered with Diners Club International. 



#iHELP was presented in world known ArcticStartup blog with direct interview with our CEO and inventor, Andraž Ogorevc.


We want to #SaveLives and help globally with our working project and that's why we need your help. The funded amount from this campaign will go into:
Development and deployment of iOS iHELP app and Windows Phone app globally,

Application localization – professional translation of all our project segments to world languages (Spanish, French, Russian, Portuguese and so on…),
Making the greatest, the biggest and most secure defibrillator (#AED) location database from around the world for everyone to use,
Animation and additional help with #CPR procedure, #AED localization and overall awareness to Community First Responders, Rescuers and all around community, worldwide,
To arrange worldwide partnership for further project development and maintenance.



#iHELP enables people to call for help and organize mutual assistance in any case of emergency, for i.e. traffic accident, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), strokes and seizures, epileptic or diabetes attack, in home fire or flood etc. So far, #iHELP launched iHELP android application and Helth Card with which we aim to reduce the current high rate of mortality in all cases of emergency, increase the level of public awareness about ways of assistance to any victims and, also, to improve the level of socially responsible community.

We have knowledge and we know how to go global - we have been doing since 2012. and we can be proud of saving lives with our iHELP project. Since, we have developed:

SOS alarm platform for Ambulance, Police, Firefighters and Lost person association,

Fully functional ICE Android app in English, Slovenian, Bulgarian, German and Croatian language,

112 EMS system for alarming First Responders and professional Rescuers with SMS and smart phone notifications,

Most detailed AED location database for Slovenia, Croatia, Austria, New Zealand and UK,
Access to personal Health Records for users and rescuers and then some…


#iHELP is exceptional and original. Here's why:

#iHELP provides the biggest emergency care network in the World,

#iHELP reduces time of help by 6 times or more,

#iHELP effectively increases chances of survival in most urgent cases,

#iHELP creates a solution that allows a 70% probability of survival in case of Heart Attack and Sudden Cardiac Arrest,

#iHELP saves money to users (lower premiums for life & health insurance).


#iHELP smartphone app provides users a quick, easy, and massive sending of SOS alarm messages to family members, friends, professional rescuers, Emergency Medical Service (EMS - 112/911/999) and all users of iHELP mobile application within radius of a 500 meters, or more, from the casualty. The application provides instructions for first aid, overview of the nearest defibrillators (#AED), how far away are the emergency rooms, police and fire stations, how many users are in the immediate vicinity and how far away are the family members or friends.

of the phone while using a calculator on the rear side; keep the GPS map up on
one screen while accessing your music menu on the reverse; customize the rear

The Siam 7X is transporting users to a new
realm of technological possibilities and efficiency, and soon it will be hard
to remember how people functioned using only one side of their cell phone.
The front screen of the 4.7” Siam 7X
is a full HD screen, and the back is an E Ink display – similar to a Kindle,
but with expansive multitasking functionality, including Notifications,  News/Social Feeds,  Media Controls,  Calender, Weather, Widgets and customizable
wallpaper. The back screen is lockable for when not in use, and the E Ink
display is adjustable to users' needs, ensuring clarity no matter the lighting
indoors or bright sunshine outside. 
All Kickstarter level supporters receive a pair of BioSport smart earbuds by
SMS Audio. The BioSport buds feature professionally tuned 12 mm drivers to
deliver studio-mastered sound, are compatible with every major fitness app, and
are water resistant. Like the dual-screen cell phone, the BioSport earphones
expand the functioning of a standard accessory by incorporating heart
monitoring – eliminating the need to haul around multiple devices when working
out.
The Siam 7X is available just in
time for the holidays, and makes the perfect gift for everyone from casual
cellphone users to gadget geeks, who will be excited to know that Siam 7X is an
unlocked handset. The phone is compatible with all Android apps, and is
available on T-Mobile and AT&T cellular networks.
All Kickstarter supporter to
purchase the Siam 7X earn membership in the Owners' Club, which includes a
lifetime warranty, accidental coverage, free upgrade to the next model, and
invites to special events and promotions.
The Siam 7X dual-scree smart phone has been in development for more than two years, during which time we have devoted immeasurable attention to making sure the product is top-quality, both in terms of the physical device and the business plan to bring it to market. Like any physical product, it’s been important for us to unite all of the right points of interest, source the most reliable and cost-efficient materials, and secure the best assembling partners.We have devoted particular attention
to the back screen function, as this is charting new territory in mobile
technology. We’ve located and resolved issues that affected the functioning of
various applications for the back screen, and we’ve focused on making sure the
back screen communicates seamlessly with the rest of the device so as to
prevent “crossed wires” when using functions on the front or back screen – or
both at the same time. Our research and enhancements remain ongoing, therefore,
we will continuously send software updates to Siam 7X owners.",11.0,3,"1 Campaign

NFC support to achieve the best possible speeds delivering military 
grade encryption. Encryption pertains to the most effective way of 
achieving data security. In order to read encrypted files, you need to 
have access on secret password or key that will enable you to decrypt 
the file. Encryption helps in protecting your data by encrypting it. 
Device encryption is highly essential because this helps protecting your
 content from unwanted eyes and in case your device is lost, no one can 
manage to access your data.

NuCrypt is very simple and easy to use and can be set up in any computer with an exclusive built in tool or any NFC supported phone with our Smartphone application. First time connecting the USB device the default partition mounts where you can set your password. After the password confirmed, a password hash is generated from it. The second partition gets encrypted with the hash and connects to your desktop. The second partition is the place where you store all your secure data. After unmounting the device the files stay encrypted.

easy to use, light, compact and provides an ideal solution when commuting
and travelling. 
The Ease Cable Tidy, is currently only compatible with a type G electrical plug.  The type G plug is mainly used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Cyprus, Malta, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong.
We design
products that make your life easier without inconveniencing
someone else's.  Our products are practical, beautiful, easy to use and
respectful to people and our planet. 


Over two years ago I was gifted an ipad and was quickly
faced with the problem of keeping the charger safe when on the go. At the
beginning I was storing the charger in the original box but that wasn't
practical so I designed and made my own case.




My desire to keep inventing and sharing my creations has
led me to start my own company Ease Design Products Ltd. 





My mission is to run a
good business whilst promoting an ethical and sustainable future; and thus
leading by example. I want to ensure everyone involved in the design,
manufacturing and sales is being paid and treated fairly and that sustainable
energy is being used at all stages. 



For example I have paid the students who
helped with the CAD design £9 per hour although I was advised to pay them no
more than the minimum wage.  I have also chosen manufacturers based in the UK who use
sustainable energy and recycled plastic where possible.


About the Ease Cable Tidy

Ease Cable Tidy stores ipad and iphone cable chargers. It is
easy to use, light and compact and provides an ideal solution when commuting
and travelling. 

There is nothing more disappointing than discovering your
charger no longer works when you need it urgently. Save yourself the
frustration of running out of battery in the middle of an important
presentation or work meeting by storing your charger safely. Furthermore
storing it using Ease Cable Tidy not only keeps it from being damaged but also
protects your clothes, suitcase or bag from getting ripped by the three pin
plug.  
The Ease Cable Tidy has a funky design with a transparent lid
so you know at a glance whether or not you have packed your cable. It comes in four popular colours you can choose from! 


The perks offered are a variety of various combinations of
the 4 different colours (White, Pink, Green and Black) of the Ease Cable
 Tidy with some options to receive them with free p&p.

<h3><strong>The Digital Age</strong></h3>
<p>Modern day life is a chaotic mix of digital device after digital device. If we’re not using our phones whilst commuting on public transport then we’re using a laptop when we get to work, or a tablet in a business meeting, or a smart watch for notifications on the go - the list is endless. Today, we rely on digital devices to stay ‘in the know’ much like people just decades ago relied on newspapers and just a select few television channels for their information. Digital technologies may be ever-changing and developing but one thing remains an issue - battery life still isn’t good enough!</p>

<p>Mobile phones have integrated into our daily life so closely that we are constantly holding our phone at anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554367110/rdpkzaqnxdusguphhpm4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Did you know that the <strong>surface of a smart phone is contaminated with</strong> <strong>3.5 times more bacteria than the toilet seat</strong>? Plus, more than one-third of the mobile phone users have never cleaned their phone!</p>
<p>Why are our phones so dirty? One of the primary reasons is our own behaviour. The average person checks their mobile phone approximately once every 12 minutes, or 80 times per day. This means our hands are on our devices nonstop, and they are likely accompanying us on nearly every errand and activity, perhaps even when we visit the toilet.</p>
<p>While you might think of yourself as a particularly clean person, and a frequent hand -washer, your hands are actually one of your worst culprits. These appendages are in use constantly, touching everything from door handles to cash to sink taps. Along the way, your hands are capable of collecting enormous amounts of germs. From the fingertips to the elbow, you’ll find an average of 2 and 10 million bacteria. </p>
<p>A second reason that our phones are so dirty is the heat they produce. Warm environments are where bacteria thrive. Unfortunately, your phone has its own necessary heat-producing mechanisms, and you’re only adding to its warm environment by holding the device in your hands or storing it in your pockets. Those toasty atmospheres mean bacteria can grow and spread.</p>
<p>Your phone is a breeding ground for a wide variety of different organisms; one scientific study discovered roughly 7,000 types of bacteria in 51 smartphone samples. Before you panic, it’s important to note that many of these bacteria are actually naturally occurring, good-for-us bacteria. Much of what is found on our phones is also what is found in our hands and mouths. That same study revealed that 22% of bacterial families overlapped on fingers and phones. A doctor involved with the study said that mobile phones “carry our own personal biome,” which is one way of looking at things.</p>
<p>And you can’t trust other people to be clean either. Research shows that 95% of people don't wash their hands properly. If you're shaking hands with colleagues or touching something that anyone else has ever touched (basically, everything) there’s serious germ potential.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554343799/njrzp2lhe0ywzbsfz6bw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It’s those pathogenic bacteria and other germs you need to be mindful of. Here’s what might be lurking on your mobile:</p>
<p>E. coli</p>
<p>In one study, 16% of phones sampled were found to have E. coli present. This is a type of bacteria that can live in the intestines and be transferred via faecal matter. It causes ailments such as food poisoning, diarrhoea, or occasionally more serious illness.</p>
<p>Staphylococcus aureus</p>
<p>Another common bacteria found on mobile phones is Staphylococcus aureus. This bacteria can be harmful or not depending upon the strain, but certain kinds are responsible for staph infections---typically minor skin infections that can be treated with antibiotics. However, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, also known as MRSA, is a more serious type of staph bacteria that can cause potentially life-threatening infections. In the healthcare settings, where MRSA has been known to spread, it can lead to pneumonia, surgical site infections, or bloodstream infections. This has lead to a great deal of research regarding the role of mobile phones in a hospital or healthcare setting, with many facilities putting stricter phone-cleaning standards in place for their staff.</p>
<p>Influenza</p>
<p>Nobody wants to catch the flu, but this virus can find its way to you via a mobile device. Able to survive on surfaces for as long as 24 hours, is another phone fiend to be avoided. If you don’t want to be ill in bed for a week or more, best get that phone cleaned up regularly.</p>
<p>Clostridium difficile</p>
<p>This bacteria can cause unfortunate bouts of diarrhoea. Let’s just leave it at that.</p>
<p>Streptococcus</p>
<p>The source of strep throat, an illness more common in children, streptococcus bacteria can also cause scarlet fever, impetigo, toxic shock syndrome, or necrotising fasciitis (a flesh-eating disease).</p>

<h3>A water waste reduction system in the palm of your hand</h3>
<p>As we know the greatest legacy of our planet is water, an essential element in the life of all living beings.</p>
<p>It’s our responsibility as major users of this vital resource, do our part to ensure it, and a good way to start this is by reducing water waste</p>
<h3>So with this in mind we introduce: Nemo.</h3>
<p>Nemo is an easy installation water waste reduction system, it's ideal to monitor water flow of homes or residential and commercial buildings.</p>
<p>With nemo you'll have all water flow data to monitor, from several sources as you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>taps </li>
<li>showers</li>
<li>sprinklers</li>
<li>or other generic water flow. </li>
</ul>
<h3>What Nemo can do?</h3>
<p>Well, currently Nemo is a prototype and works installed along the water flow you want to measure.</p>
<p>Using sensors, Nemo capture the water flow data, then these data are transferred by Wi-Fi directly to the application installed on your device, which then processes the information and displays the result in the palm of your hand.</p>
<p>Also, if you want, this data can be sent to the Nemo server (needs an internet connection), that will make more accurate calculations, providing you reports for a variety of functions, ranging from a more accurate water waste reduction report, to a functionality to create economic goals to avoid more waste, saving your water and money.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/6wSTjfe3sg0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<h3>What you can do with Nemo?</h3>
<p>First of all, this is a way to reduce water waste and make a better planet, but besides it with nemo installed on your water flow system, you can easily:</p>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ensure that your water bill stay within budget</strong><br/>You can follow on your mobile device screen all water volume that was consumed until this moment.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Create a shared water system without break any walls to install</strong><br/>If you live in a condo, or somewhere with shared water system, you and your neighbours can install Nemo in each apartment to ensure a fair water bill division, paying what consumed</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ensure that no exists any leak in your water system</strong><br/>An unknown water leak can take several days to be found, and depending of size of this leak and the time that this issue was unresolved, a building structure can become corrupted.<br/><br/>As each Nemo piece has an ID, what make it easy to identify any unexpected event on your mobile device screen, if a catastrophic leak occurs, Nemo will alert you by App, email, WhatsApp and SMS text message indicating how much water was lost.​<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Measures water flow in real time conserve water</strong><br/>With your Nemo app installed in your device, you can measure your water consumed in real time for any source you want.</li>

</div></div>","A water waste reduction system in the palm of your hand
As we know the greatest legacy of our planet is water, an essential element in the life of all living beings.
It’s our responsibility as major users of this vital resource, do our part to ensure it, and a good way to start this is by reducing water waste
So with this in mind we introduce: Nemo.
Nemo is an easy installation water waste reduction system, it's ideal to monitor water flow of homes or residential and commercial buildings.
With nemo you'll have all water flow data to monitor, from several sources as you want:

taps 
showers
sprinklers
or other generic water flow. 

What Nemo can do?
Well, currently Nemo is a prototype and works installed along the water flow you want to measure.
Using sensors, Nemo capture the water flow data, then these data are transferred by Wi-Fi directly to the application installed on your device, which then processes the information and displays the result in the palm of your hand.
Also, if you want, this data can be sent to the Nemo server (needs an internet connection), that will make more accurate calculations, providing you reports for a variety of functions, ranging from a more accurate water waste reduction report, to a functionality to create economic goals to avoid more waste, saving your water and money.

What you can do with Nemo?
First of all, this is a way to reduce water waste and make a better planet, but besides it with nemo installed on your water flow system, you can easily:



Ensure that your water bill stay within budgetYou can follow on your mobile device screen all water volume that was consumed until this moment. 

Create a shared water system without break any walls to installIf you live in a condo, or somewhere with shared water system, you and your neighbours can install Nemo in each apartment to ensure a fair water bill division, paying what consumed



Ensure that no exists any leak in your water systemAn unknown water leak can take several days to be found, and depending of size of this leak and the time that this issue was unresolved, a building structure can become corrupted.As each Nemo piece has an ID, what make it easy to identify any unexpected event on your mobile device screen, if a catastrophic leak occurs, Nemo will alert you by App, email, WhatsApp and SMS text message indicating how much water was lost.​ 

Measures water flow in real time conserve waterWith your Nemo app installed in your device, you can measure your water consumed in real time for any source you want.

The safe-lock hook, a unique design to secure solid connection! Our factory partner is an MFi licensed manufacturer. So the Thunder-C Lightning plug is produced 100% following the MFi specification. We’d be delighted to explain more details which have never been disclosed.Besides the Lightning connector, our certified C48 includes a piece of PCB and an official IC with a unique SID, which together make you get rid of your worry about what you often see “not certified” on other iPhones.In order to enable a certified Lightning plug to resist up to 100N bending force, C48 needs to be entirely wrapped up by a tagger, and after it being laser welded, it takes a two-time molding process to strengthen and form the plug.Usually a 1M Lightning cable uses a 24AWG wire, but we advance the wire 3 grades to 21AWG, which enables Thunder-C Lightning cable to support 2.4A charge even when it is up to 1.5M long.There’s a 5.1 kΩ resistance inside the USB-A+USB-C Thunder-C plug, which restricts the output up to 1.5A current Max. so as to prevent any permanent damage from a greater current demand from the other end when it is plugged into the SmartPhone (or NB).In addition to Thunder-C Lightning cable, we have developed another 4-in-1 Thunder-C cable, including microUSB, USB-A, & two USB-C plugs, supporting all kinds of power sources and all kinds of portable devices other than iPhone.No matter how many portable devices you have, the Superpower Pack helps you get rid of all the crap always!You will be amazed by the further application of the 4-in-1 Thunder-C cable when it comes to emergency situation, you can even use the 4-in-1 cable to charge MacBook by an Android phone or a common phone charger.Support Fast Charge TechnologyBecause of the upgraded 21AWG wire, both of 4-in-1 Thunder-C & 2-in-1 Type-B Thunder-C cables they are all compatible with fast charge technology including Qualcomm QC 2.0/ 3.0 and Mediatek Pump Express. For your friends or family members who are not iPhone users.

It takes more than 3 years from Orobis Transform to Thunder-C. In fact, the current environment in Taiwan is not fertile for a startup company, particularly for a hardware one. Apart from this, because of the 4 specialized connectors, the development cost of Thunder-C is much higher than that of other cable products. Yet we persist and have accomplished the task.
Specialized connectors: These are the key components of Single Hand Switch hybrid plug, produced by four sets of specialized connector molds.Yes! The plastic cases of all of the Thunder-C samples you’ve seen are produced by these molds, they are not mockup samples!These molds reinforce the USB-C adaptors, keeping them strong and sturdy.Unlike the cheap product, the Type-C connector of Thunder-C is of high quality.Different from the Lightning plug able to resist up to 100N bending force specified by Apple, the Thunder-C plug, due to a different structure, can resist up to 85N bending force, which is based on the USB Association specification.Although the current extraction force of our USB-A plug has reached USB Association specification, but we found that many USB ports have become much looser than original state. Therefore, we decided to add the two windows back for our USB-A plug. This change will make our USB-A plug as tight as conventional USB-A plug, and this change is already under processing. So, the Thunder-C you'll get will be this new version.Not yet! We don’t know why Apple hasn’t started any application for the certification of the Lightning cable with a USB-C plug. This makes Thunder-C Lightning cable unable to be marked as an MFi product to sell in the retail market yet. In fact, this is exactly the reason why we’re here. Perhaps we have to wait for a few months. We need your support to help us get through the last winter. Even more, we believe that your support shown on Indiegogo might be another thrust for the MFi certification.Nonetheless, the Thunder-C Lightning cable you get is equal to an MFi certified cable. It’s endurable and high quality, and “not certified” shall never appear on your iPhone.Please share our story with your friends; each of your buzz will be a huge power to help speed up the birth of MFi marked Thunder-C!",39.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<p>After doing some extensive research into the prevention of credit card skimming, I now want to keep my self and others around me protected. </p>
<p>One of the most logical solutions would be to use some kind of RFID card scrambler like the one featured in the YouTube video. I found, (in my opinion) the best RFID card available here in Australia. It retails for $40 AUD. </p>
<p>I contacted the company that holds the Australia Patents and we negotiated a deal. One that would allow me to mass produce a batch of these cards which will carry the Australian Patents and Certified to Australian Standards.</p>
<p>The card will be branded ""Tutis CCS"". Tutis is latin for the word ""Protected"". ""Tutis CCS"" stands for ""Protected Credit Card Security.""</p>
<p>In order to help me achieve my goal, we need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We need to produce a batch of 10,000 cards to get it started. For every member that funds us $25 to contribute towards this cause, we will send you your very own ""Tutis CCS"" branded RFID card. If we are unable to reach our goal of $250,000 (which is 10,000 cards x $25), we will still proceed with the production of these RFID cards and every member that funded us $25 will still receive their very own ""Tutis CCS""branded RFID card.</p>
<p><strong>How does it protect my credit card?</strong></p>
<p>E-Field is an auto-response electronic field, which is triggered by the signals used to detect and steal information stored on credit and debit cards. E-Field creates a protective perimeter around cards the second they become vulnerable.<br/>Card details are stored on RFID chips, which can be breached, from a distance of up to 20mt, using an RFID scanner. E-Field is the technology that blocks the threatening signals dispersed by scanning devices.</p>
<p>Everyone should protect their cards and identities as once compromised it can have lifelong repercussions. Companies that provide employees with Corporate cards should also supply each one with a reputable RFID card to minimise risk and the huge burden of administration and recovery of funds and assisting stranded employees when cards are cancelled.</p>

<h4>The nightmare experience of a friend looking for a job:</h4>
<blockquote>Danny want to change jobs and did what we all do - search for jobs on the internet job sites.  He applied for a number and after a few weeks got the job he was looking for.  Celebration time.  Well, that was short lived; he kept getting emails of jobs available, 24x7 a day even from place he did register with.  Opt-out and unsubscribe had no impact at all to the pint he decided to change email address.  Is that familiar?</blockquote>
<blockquote> Over a beer he suggested, ""Wouldn't be great if I can get all these offers when I am looking for a job, and when I got a job it stops instantly and when I need a job again in 2 years, the offers start again.  It feels like my life has been taken over by recruiters and now I get marketing emails from companies I never even heard of.""</blockquote>
<p>That is exactly what Nativ protect, your privacy:  Select recruitment firms when you need a job and get all the offers you need, when you found the perfect job, deselect recruitment forms and offers stop immediately - YOU ARE IN CONTROL and manage your privacy.  Danny knows that his email and contact details have been sold to other marketing firms and it will never stop - so he had to change contact details.</p>

<h2>How will we use your money?</h2>
<p>The first $80,000 will give us enough money to complete the development and deployment of messaging and VOIP on iPhone and Android. The development of the basic messaging and integrated display of webpages is complete and in Alpha testing.  This will allow us to introduce paid accounts from brands and companies (in the pipeline) after which the Nativ project will be self-sustaining.</p>
<p>However, we have a much bigger vision for Nativ, and we need your help to hire and expand our team. Below are some of our stretch goals:</p>

<p>We will build these features even if the targets are not met, but without additional funding, it will take us much longer. Additional funding will also allow us to build a stronger service that is more resilient and protection against hackers and virus attacks. With your support, we can make internet privacy on the mobile a reality again and protect freedom around the world.</p>

<p>When we request you to download the Nativ App, your email address for registration will be matched with the email address you used to donate to our campaign. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Make sure your registration email address matches the email you use when you donate on Indiegogo.</span><br/></p>
<p>If you have any problems or questions, don't hesitate to contact us at support@nativcommunication.com.</p>
<p><b>Is Nativ Free?</b></p>
<p>Yes, Basic Nativ accounts will always be free for mobile users with additional packages for higher data users and in the future, virus protection.</p>
<p><b>Does using Nativ really mean no-one can read any of my IM's or see the sites I visited?</b></p>
<p>As a general principle, it is impossible to have 100% safety. Nativ does not keep any record of your IM's (you are the only one with a record until you erase it from your mobile) or internet history which can identify your mobile. </p>
<p><b>How is Nativ funded so far?</b></p>
<p>So far, we have had funds from two partners in Nativ who funded the initial development. </p>

<p>Yes, we have enabled PayPal donations. </p>

</div></div>","The world’s first mobile App that protect your mobile identity
on the internet while surfing or just chat to friends.  

   Total Privacy, Security, Control!

  WARNING: If you use WhatsApp your personal data is at RISK  
Your mobile is invisible to the world, no matter what webpages you visit - no more blocked webpages outside your country, Nativ takes care of it.





Nativ is an Instant Messaging service with a TWIST. It has been developed by a team of technical junkies and visionaries, brought together in Malta in the EU from the UK, South Africa, Australia and Sweden.  

Our goal is straight forward: we want to protect people's privacy while they communicate or visit the internet on their mobile devices, from the tracking and stalking which is currently the order of the day by social networks, search engines and marketing companies. 
The nightmare experience of a friend looking for a job:
Danny want to change jobs and did what we all do - search for jobs on the internet job sites.  He applied for a number and after a few weeks got the job he was looking for.  Celebration time.  Well, that was short lived; he kept getting emails of jobs available, 24x7 a day even from place he did register with.  Opt-out and unsubscribe had no impact at all to the pint he decided to change email address.  Is that familiar?
 Over a beer he suggested, ""Wouldn't be great if I can get all these offers when I am looking for a job, and when I got a job it stops instantly and when I need a job again in 2 years, the offers start again.  It feels like my life has been taken over by recruiters and now I get marketing emails from companies I never even heard of.""
That is exactly what Nativ protect, your privacy:  Select recruitment firms when you need a job and get all the offers you need, when you found the perfect job, deselect recruitment forms and offers stop immediately - YOU ARE IN CONTROL and manage your privacy.  Danny knows that his email and contact details have been sold to other marketing firms and it will never stop - so he had to change contact details.
Join forces with us and together we will make the difference.  


We all feel like this - they call it Big Data


THE CONTROL IS WITH YOU, WHO WILL SEE YOU OR WHERE YOU LEAVE YOUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINT.
We believe that privacy and security is a fundamental right which must be protected at all costs. Changes to the internet to accommodate IoT (Internet of Things), makes us more vulnerable than ever before to lose our privacy once and for all, and with that, our right to freedom.  
Nativ protects your identity and makes your mobile device invisible to the world and thus limits your digital footprint.  Your mobile number, email or mobile IP/Mac address is not published or made visible at anytime while you explore cyberspace.

BEING THE INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU WANT TO BE IS A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT TO ALL PEOPLE OF THE WORLD! 




The basic Nativ messaging/VOIP is free and ad-free, where you the user choose who you connect and engage with, at anytime.  Befriend your friends with a single click and chat as much as you like or exchange photos and have conversations, retaining your privacy at all times. Messages are encrypted and safe and for your eyes ONLY.  
Configuration of brands and companies you want to engage with, is made easy by simply ticking on and off.  In other words, when you do not select a company, they cannot send you any messages, offers or any other promotional material - YOU ARE IN TOTAL CONTROL. No more unsolicited emails or text messages as your data is never revealed (mobile number, email address etc).
The enhanced Nativ service for mobile phone anonymity when surfing the internet and accessing websites, is subscription based, starting from $1.99 per month and blocks pop-ups, spam links, your history and enables cross-country access.  No more frustration caused by blocked access to a website because you are not in that country - visit and watch what you want at anytime. 


Nativ in the news!

Privacy is Freedom



How will we use your money?
The first $80,000 will give us enough money to complete the development and deployment of messaging and VOIP on iPhone and Android. The development of the basic messaging and integrated display of webpages is complete and in Alpha testing.  This will allow us to introduce paid accounts from brands and companies (in the pipeline) after which the Nativ project will be self-sustaining.
However, we have a much bigger vision for Nativ, and we need your help to hire and expand our team. Below are some of our stretch goals:



We will build these features even if the targets are not met, but without additional funding, it will take us much longer. Additional funding will also allow us to build a stronger service that is more resilient and protection against hackers and virus attacks. With your support, we can make internet privacy on the mobile a reality again and protect freedom around the world.

We Would Like to Say THANK YOU!!!


PERKS:
We understand there is no ""one-fit-all"" service as each of us, as individuals, have different requirements.  Nativ have various packages and you will find one which fits your lifestyle.


FREE Service - Bronze: All Nativ services including identity protection and unblocked websites access with 200MB of data transfer free.
$1,99 pm - Silver: All Bronze services including identity protection and unblocked websites access with 5GB per month data transfer.
$3,99 pm - Gold: All Bronze services including identity protection and unblocked websites access with 75GB per month data transfer.
$5,99 pm - Platinum: All Bronze services including identity protection and unblocked websites access with UNLIMITED data transfer.

We value you contribution and your belief in privacy and spam free internet services and offer you the following:





REFERRALS:
Our contributors are key for us to be successful and tell people about us.  We like to show our appreciation for this by rewarding you with a FREE upgrade from the perk you chose for each referral as below.  Example: A Power User only need 3 referrals that take any package to upgrade free to a Believer package - that is huge.
We track referrals in Indiegogo from the sharing buttons on the top left of the campaign page. 



What does the Press say?
The debate and concerns about our privacy continues around the world and can't be ignored any longer. See the links below from a small sample.

I have questions, how can I reach your team?
For questions related to the Indiegogo campaign, feel free to email us at info@nativcommunication.com or connect with us here. 
How will perks be matched to my Nativ account?
When we request you to download the Nativ App, your email address for registration will be matched with the email address you used to donate to our campaign. 
Make sure your registration email address matches the email you use when you donate on Indiegogo.
If you have any problems or questions, don't hesitate to contact us at support@nativcommunication.com.
Is Nativ Free?
Yes, Basic Nativ accounts will always be free for mobile users with additional packages for higher data users and in the future, virus protection.
Does using Nativ really mean no-one can read any of my IM's or see the sites I visited?
As a general principle, it is impossible to have 100% safety. Nativ does not keep any record of your IM's (you are the only one with a record until you erase it from your mobile) or internet history which can identify your mobile. 
How is Nativ funded so far?
So far, we have had funds from two partners in Nativ who funded the initial development. 
Is it possible to donate via PayPal?
Yes, we have enabled PayPal donations. 
$80,000 seems like a very small amount for a major messaging service and internet protection, how much money do you actually need?
$80,000 is the minimum which we need to get over the start line. When we achieve this, Nativ becomes self-funding to an extent,  and we can then develop the extra services, although this may be  a slower process.  However, if we have $600,000 we would easily be able to accomplish all of the objectives listed above.  Any additional funds above that will bring a whole new world to play,  such as direct commerce from the same message stream with all the privacy and security.

How will I know when to claim my perk or register?
We will notify you via the email address you used to donate here on Indiegogo, when you can register and download your application with the links to be used.  To ensure we provide you with the requested perk, you will also receive a ""token"" to enter upon registration that will enable the service according to your perk.
Further to the above we will update the campaign page with all this information and status updates to ensure you are being kept informed at all times.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us on info@nativcommunication.com.
When can I expect to get my perk?
We are creating something which is very new and challenging in the new internet era where everything is connected.  There will be many challenges (both technical and political) so we cannot guarantee that perks can be delivered on time, despite our best efforts. The service will be made commercially available in stages from September 2015.  Perks dependent on free months, will only start counting once the full service of the perk is available.
For example:  If block access is available from September 2015, then your free months start from October 2015 (the month following the available service).  This ensures that you are not losing any of your perk times.  The Basic features can be used by all, the moment it is made available.
We promise timely and transparent communications if our delivery schedule changes for any reason. 
Other than contributing, how can I help?
You can spread the word about Nativ to your friends. Privacy and Security is most effective if everybody uses it, and the more people who use the service, the better for all.",19.0,1,"1 Campaign

<div><h3>Who We Are</h3></div>
<p>Hello, we’re Stacey &amp; Martha Miller and we came up with
The Protector Bears (Well, more like she did, I just brought the snacks). As
parents of five children, we have experienced a lot of sleepless nights. Most of
those coming from one (or two or three) of our kids being too scared to sleep
by themselves. Then one day, we had a brilliant idea (OK OK, she had a
brilliant idea), why not have a teddy bear go to a school to learn how to
protect children when they sleep? That’s when we founded Tough Teddy Academy™
and The Protector Bears™. </p>
<p>“A school for bears? Cool!” Yep and it’s only for bears who
want to protect children. No lazy bears here! Once a bear has completed their
training, they become official Protector Bears™. They will receive a Certificate
of Graduation, complete with their name and when they graduated! They also
receive a Safety Flashlight (Used to scare off monsters that are planning a
sneak attack) and a bracelet for your child that matches the Protector Bears
necklace, forever linking them together.</p>
<p>“OK, that sounds good, but does it work?” Yes, it really
does work! We have sold hundreds around our local area here, including to
friends and family and the feedback we constantly receive is how great the
bears are and how their child is no longer afraid to sleep by themselves! </p>
<p>“I’m sold, what do you need from me?” We need your financial
support as well as your help to spread the word about what we are doing. We
have huge plans for our bears but can’t do them without you so please, anything
you can do to help, we are truly grateful.</p><p><br/></p>
<div><h3>How we’ll use your money</h3></div>
<p>Once we reach the end of our funding time (and hopefully we
get fully funded by then), every single dollar will go to creating our unique
bears. Currently, we use a prototype stand in bear (They are graduates of Tough
Teddy Academy™ and can still kick monster butt!) and flashlight but we want to
use our own design. In order to do this, we need place large orders.  We have the design of the bears already
completed but the flashlight design we are leaving up to you (See Perks for
more info)!</p>
<p>Our most important goal is to create a truly magical bear
that helps your child overcome their fears. The more we raise the better our
chances of achieving that. </p>
<p>Sold yet? If not, maybe one of our perks will help motivate
you.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432874628/jir3g3w4wteqszkgaohd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>
<div><h3>Contributor Perks</h3></div>
<p>Let’s face it, perks work too which is why we have created
some awesome perk packages for you. Want to have us give you a shout out on
Facebook or Twitter? Done! How about getting your name posted on our Funders
page on our website? Bam, it’s yours! Or, how about one of our limited quantity
prototype bears? Don’t mention it, we’ve already set them to the side just for
you. </p>
<p>We have many more perks too! Just see the sidebar to the
right ---&gt;</p>
<p>Those perks not big enough for you? Well how about these
standalone perks.</p><p><br/></p>
<div><h3>Standalone Perks</h3></div>
<p>It’s time to roll out the big timers. These are standalone
perks which mean they do not include all the perks above it, only the shoutout and getting listed on our Funders page are included. Don’t worry though,
these perks are so ginormous they don’t need everything else to go with them.</p>
<p>Let’s start with getting your business listed on our Funders
page. Your business’s support means a lot and we want to show everyone who
visits our website just how much we appreciate it. Don’t have a business or
want something BIGGER? How about getting to name your very own Protector Bear™?
Or better yet, getting to name a brand new Protector Bear™ Agent that will be
sold worldwide? Oh yea, did we mention your name will also be on the tag
letting the world know you named that bear? There is a limit of 6 of these
perks though so grab them quick!</p>
<p>Want more? Wow, you guys are tough! How about getting the
very first Protector Bear™ Agent from our first run production series? The
Graduation Certificates will be marked as the first graduating class and will
have 000001 serial numbers (Indicating the very first bear of that line). We
only have 6 of these available as well (3 boys, 3 girls) so grab them before
they run out!</p>
<p>How about one more standalone perk. We have come up with a
few designs of our Safety Flashlight, which is used to scare away scary
monsters planning a sneak attack. However, what if YOU designed one for us?
Don’t worry, if you don’t know how to draw just let us know how you want it to
look and we’ll (Meaning me) sketch it up for you. When you give the OK, we’ll
get them made and your name will be on the tag letting everyone know you
designed this flashlight.</p><p><br/></p>
<div><h3>Other ways to help</h3></div>
<p>Can’t contribute financially but still want to help? Share
us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, MySpace, Text, Snail Mail, Messenger
Piegeons, Smoke Signals or whichever way you use to communicate. Please don’t
burn down any forests sending smoke signals.</p>
<p>Friends are great, aren’t they? Let them know how great they
are by asking them to contribute to us. I’m sure they will thank you with big
hugs and food.</p>
<p>Have a question for us? Visit our website to send us an
email.</p><p><br/></p>
<div><h3>Some Rules</h3></div>
<p>Here are some ground rules to get us started. First, names
must be appropriate. This includes your name as well as the name you give the
bear (If you buy that perk). Flashlight Designs must also be appropriate. No
adult type businesses will be listed on our website, this includes pornographic
and those promoting hate.</p><p></p></div>","tl;dr

Or better yet, getting to name a brand new Protector Bear™ Agent that will be
sold worldwide? Oh yea, did we mention your name will also be on the tag
letting the world know you named that bear? There is a limit of 6 of these
perks though so grab them quick!
Want more? Wow, you guys are tough! How about getting the
very first Protector Bear™ Agent from our first run production series? The
Graduation Certificates will be marked as the first graduating class and will
have 000001 serial numbers (Indicating the very first bear of that line). We
only have 6 of these available as well (3 boys, 3 girls) so grab them before
they run out!
How about one more standalone perk. We have come up with a
few designs of our Safety Flashlight, which is used to scare away scary
monsters planning a sneak attack. However, what if YOU designed one for us?
Don’t worry, if you don’t know how to draw just let us know how you want it to
look and we’ll (Meaning me) sketch it up for you. When you give the OK, we’ll
get them made and your name will be on the tag letting everyone know you
designed this flashlight.
Other ways to help
Can’t contribute financially but still want to help? Share
us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, MySpace, Text, Snail Mail, Messenger
Piegeons, Smoke Signals or whichever way you use to communicate. Please don’t

Some Rules
Here are some ground rules to get us started. First, names
must be appropriate. This includes your name as well as the name you give the
bear (If you buy that perk). Flashlight Designs must also be appropriate. No

We know how challenging it is for a blogger to create content and gain exposure.   The largest sites have access to both paid writers and volunteers. Most small to mid-sized bloggers do not.  
The solution for small to mid-sized publishers is to build a community of writers.  Though this isn't easy.  That's where JURNL comes in.
JURNL makes it simple and worthwhile for writers to join and create content. This aspect of JURNL is and will always be critical because with community small to mid sized bloggers are able to create plenty of content and elevate their publications to be on par with content being created by the world's most popular sites.
Most of all JURNL will always be about making it fun, simple and providing publishers with creative ways to create professional looking content that engages both your community and audience.      

   What's Required    We are seeking $25,000 to program the ""engine"" that creates JURNLs so that anyone that wants a JURNL can create one in minutes.
Over the last few months we have been installing JURNLs manually and with customer feedback improving them.  We are now excited to take the final step to launch and make JURNL available to the world.                                                    The Impact

The hurdle is taking the current JURNL code and developing the technology that with the click of a mouse creates a new instance of JURNL.  
 Our team of developers has been working on the project for 3 months. They are talented and an experienced, creative group of developers and designers that have launched multiple large applications.  
We have a clear outcome for releasing the first version of JURNL and believe that by keeping things simple and clean we will create one of the most fun, and user friendly ways to build an online publication and  community.

The publishing industry has large companies including Wordpress & Tumblr. There is a risk that JURNL is seen in the same light as them.  The PR and marketing challenge will be to ensure that JURNL is first and foremost seen as social platform that enables JURNLists to build a community equipped with the best tools to easily create content, invite new members to join and participate and share what's being created.Other Ways You Can HelpWe appreciate all shares of this project with friends who enjoy writing, photography and/or creating videos. Thank you for the time you took to read this.  We look forward to sharing JURNL with you.Please share JURNL using the Indiegogo share tools!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>When do you start shipping?<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Shipping will commence almost immediately after we receive your pledge.</span><br/></p>
<p>Can data be transferred through SNAP?<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">No. SNAP only supports charging for iPhone.</span></p>
<p>Will the magnetic forces of SNAP damage the internal components of iPhone?<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">No. The magnetic field is negligibly small and cannot harm any iPhone components.</span></p>
<p>How do I know if SNAP is connected and charging my iPhone?<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The screen of iPhone wakes up and shows a charging status icon when connection is made.</span></p>
<p>Will SNAP support Micro-USB or USB-C?<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Please note that SNAP in this campaign is specifically for iPhone. It is currently NOT compatible with Micro-USB and USB-C. However, if this campaign is successful, Micro-USB or USB-C-compatible SNAP is definitely a possibility!</span></p>
<p>Can SNAP connect either side facing up?<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Yes. SNAP allows you to connect either side facing up. Connect without thinking.</span></p>
<p>How firm will SNAP connect the Lightning cable to your iPhone?<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It is important to understand that SNAP connects by magnetic force and not by friction. SNAP and your mobile device will likely separate when dangling iPhone from the SNAP-connected Lightning cable or by a forceful movement.</span></p>
<p>Why did you make an adapter instead of a cable?<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If this campaign goes well, a fully integrated SNAP cable is definitely a possibility!</span></p>
<p>Will SNAP affect charging speeds?<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">SNAP does not enhance nor impede charging speeds. The exposed parts are nonconductive, so you also don’t have to worry about electric shocks.</span></p>
<p>What about Apple MFI certification?<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Apple MFI certification is one of the things we’re currently looking into.</span></p>
<p>How much is shipping?<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">International shipping is already included.</span></p>
<p>Is it difficult to remove SNAP Converter from iPhone's Lightning port?<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">There is a narrow gap between SNAP Converter and iPhone, just big enough for your fingernail. So it both fits snuggly and is still able to be remove with just your fingers.</span></p>
</div>
<h2><br/></h2><p></p><h2>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h2><p>Since mass production of SNAP is already in progress, we can hardly list many risks and challenges for this project. Unlike other projects, we are shipping rewards/perks right after this campaign. Delivery of your rewards/perks is 100% guaranteed. The funding from this project allows us to go ahead with production to meet the demand of our backers.  </p><br/><p></p></div>","INTRODUCING SNAPLet's make charging easier!

How do I know if SNAP is connected and charging my iPhone?The screen of iPhone wakes up and shows a charging status icon when connection is made.
Will SNAP support Micro-USB or USB-C?Please note that SNAP in this campaign is specifically for iPhone. It is currently NOT compatible with Micro-USB and USB-C. However, if this campaign is successful, Micro-USB or USB-C-compatible SNAP is definitely a possibility!
Can SNAP connect either side facing up?Yes. SNAP allows you to connect either side facing up. Connect without thinking.
How firm will SNAP connect the Lightning cable to your iPhone?It is important to understand that SNAP connects by magnetic force and not by friction. SNAP and your mobile device will likely separate when dangling iPhone from the SNAP-connected Lightning cable or by a forceful movement.
Why did you make an adapter instead of a cable?If this campaign goes well, a fully integrated SNAP cable is definitely a possibility!
Will SNAP affect charging speeds?SNAP does not enhance nor impede charging speeds. The exposed parts are nonconductive, so you also don’t have to worry about electric shocks.
What about Apple MFI certification?Apple MFI certification is one of the things we’re currently looking into.
How much is shipping?International shipping is already included.
Is it difficult to remove SNAP Converter from iPhone's Lightning port?There is a narrow gap between SNAP Converter and iPhone, just big enough for your fingernail. So it both fits snuggly and is still able to be remove with just your fingers.

RISKS AND CHALLENGESSince mass production of SNAP is already in progress, we can hardly list many risks and challenges for this project. Unlike other projects, we are shipping rewards/perks right after this campaign. Delivery of your rewards/perks is 100% guaranteed. The funding from this project allows us to go ahead with production to meet the demand of our backers.",11.0,1,"1 Campaign

It all starts with a Good Cause.... 

There are more and more electronic devices that require a Micro USB cable for charging and for data transfer. From Our Android phones to Bluetooth speakers to our power bank and to basically every consumer electronics  ……… Imagine how many times you need to plug in a Micro USB cable everyday. 

HD Camera, Mini Wireless Router, Remote control, Wireless mouse .... you name it.

The traditional Micro USB cable are pain in the butt right now because both the USB head and  the Micro USB head are designed to be asymmetric, and there is more than 50% chance that every time you use them, you will plug in the wrong direction. Look at this... 



We run into Frustration like this many times a day. 



What if we can design the Micro USB head to be symmetric so that everyone can plug in the cable without even have to look and check every single time. 

We started our Creative Journey in searching for such a design and finally found our current manufacturing partner who can help us to realize the unique concept with a patented technology. 
This is the first cable product presented by the SuperSenseGroup  @SuperSenseGroup. We are a Team of Electrical Engineer, Designer, Manufacturing Expert, and most importantly we are all Gadget Enthusiasts.
We are in the process to Create a lot more ""Sense"" to the Consumer Hardware Market. And We called the new designed cable ----

The SenseC Reversible Micro USB Cable

With Proper cooperation with Licensed Chinese manufacturer, and working days and nights on building  (""Intimate"" Personal Relationship) with manufacturer staff and agencies, we are able to finalize our design of a Micro USB cable that will take our concepts to the next level. We want to mass produce a Durable, Well-designed, Flip-free & Universal (Reversible) Micro USB cable that will cost no more than a fortune ! And We hope that by doing so, it will make the world a better place, well at least a more efficient place to be. 













1st thing on the Design List: 

REVERSIBLE Micro USB


 + REVERSIBLE USB

- Done!  We secured the Innovative Reversible Micro USB design, We also confirmed that we are able to add in the Reversible USB head. Now Absolutely ZERO hustle/ attention required in using the SenseC cable. Now it make a lot more Sense!  















2nd on the list:    Nylon-Braided 
- Done!Tangled-Free! No more messy annoying cable riddle. The Nylon-Braided SenseC add Extra strength to the cable core. The Internal copper wires will no longer be easily damaged when pulled by external force. 

              
                  



                 
                           



3rd on the list:  Gold Plated Heads + Aluminum Shell
- Done!Gold-Plated Heads & Aluminum Shell to prevent oxidation and to reinforce the cable ends from loosen-out


           













4th on the list:    CUSTOMIZED Length !!!!!!  
                   !!! NEED YOUR SUPPORT !!! 
We want everyone to have the exact length of the SenseC cable they need !!!!  This is kind of an Ambitious Goal, and that's why we need your support! In order to do so, we need to negotiate with our partnering manufacturer, we MUST provide a committed quantity before they will help manufacturing Customized Length Cable for us !!  Please help us to build on the order quantity !

Hi, friends!My name is John. Just like you I every day using mobile phone. As you know it is necessary to regularly recharge.Every day I use the flash memory, too – for my work information, photos, music records, videos etc. So I need the charger cable and flash memory. If they are two separate items, moreover it is not very convenient to use - cable can be long and unhandy, but separate flash memory could be sometimes even too small and therefore so easy to be lost. I tried to find a comfortable solution. I did not find anything suitable to buy.Then I and my friend and colleague Nick created an electronic circuit for our own cables and made prototypes – small, flexible and light charger cables with integrated flash memory, incredible easy to use! This cable at the same time can perform three functions combined in one – to charge your phone, to work with flash memory and to perform data synchronization. Instead of two separate devices you can carry with you only one.Especially handy is to listen recorded music and charge my phone in the car at the same time.We also created a version without integrated flash memory – for those who need just a small charger cable.We called them everCharge.All our friends who saw these new charging cables are excited and also want to get some for herself! So we decided to make this World a little bit better and to start a mass production of these cables.  Our motto is:  everCharge will charge you forever! DESIGN

<p><b>MyWatt SEM3000 Series has the following functions:<br/><br/>MyWatt is simple and easy to use tool that helps you become smarter about the way you use electricity. Find out in a few seconds how much your air conditioner and TV costs to run. Check out how much power your entire house and home appliances is using in real time up to 10 channels. Immediately displays any cost changes to the electricity being consumed by the home. Studies have shown that the average homeowner can stop waisting between 10% ~ 20% of their homes energy if they have an electricity monitor.  Wireless features allow the MyWatt to be displayed in any room of the house and also shows daily, weekly, monthly energy consumption and the cost  in real time. It also shows the real time percentage of monthly target. We can also on-off or timer control of home appliances by PC software or Web Cloud service by using MyWatt Cloud.  We have 2 different type wireless transmitters. (Clamp type CRT3000 and Plug-in type PIT3000/PIT3100) </b></p>

From product concept, ID design, mechanical fabrication, hardware enhancement to software development, we are always keen for every detail and pursuing the extreme performance to cater for users’ need.Building a mobile device is not an easy job, especially a Windows phone which requires more technology knowledge on the software development besides caring for the hardware and mechanicals. However, it is our pleasure to produce a smart device with a hope to become your digital assistant by bringing more convenience for your work and profession.Why Indiegogo?When we launched the Moly X1 first generation in Asia market some quarters ago, it caused a good feedback immediately on its Windows 10 mobile OS. People from all around the world began asking if we could release a full version working for USA or Europe. That is the reason that we create the new Moly X1 with improvement on the functionality and modification on the relevant bands to cater for USA and Europe users.The Fine PrintWe will ship the Moly X1 in December 2016 to America/Canada and Europe/Australia by free delivery.Please note that you will be responsible for any customs fees, duties, VAT, import taxes if occurred.DisclaimersWater resistant: Moly X1 is a water-resistant design which means it is protected from dust ingress and low pressure water jets from any direction. Putting your Moly X1 under water and submerging your Moly X1 in liquid (e.g. swimming or shower) is strongly discouraged. Voice cognitive service - Cortana: Cortana service is now provided by Microsoft in the countries of Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States.We shall not be held responsible for failure or delay in shipment that caused by the war, military operation, epidemics, epizootic, blockade, embargo, fire, earthquakes, floods, and some other natural disasters, as well as the acts of government authorities.　　Customers are responsible for assuring the product can be lawfully imported to the destination country. The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches the recipient's country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be fulfilled by the recipient; Moly has no control over these charges. #New Moly X1 Windows phone#Help out by sharing with friends!Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who needs this!We can't do this without you. Thank you. Q&AQ: Does this device have a replaceable battery?A: No, the battery is built-in and unreplaceable.Q: Hi I really love the specs on this phone and I am considering it but I have one question what sim card does this phone work with micro SIM or Nano SIM?A: It works with micro SIM card and you need a card holder to make it work with Nano SIM.",20.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p> I met Walter Murcia, an amazing high wire artist from the Pirates of the Colombian Caribbean.    I asked him to shoot his high wire performance with the eye shooter headband.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474429360/knm8l7vmd7xnshyscaeb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Tom the Doc and Walter.</strong> He and his  troupe were into it, so they set up a special performance just for us to record. We shot it all in one take. I was handheld A cam and Walter B cam headband. This is the complete as it was recorded footage 2 cam edited.                    Run time aprox 10 minutes.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><p><strong>When smartphone video went HD, as a pro photo videographer</strong>, I became more interested in them. The new cameras surpassed my pro SD video cameras. But alas, less than ideal to hold, let alone get creative with. What good is shaky 4k quality video? With the exception of common shots, holding a phone’s camera is not like using a DSLR or video camera. Only high end phones have optical image stabilization. Forget about zooming in without shake. So all kinds of gadgets, holders, and sticks came about, all are 1 trick ponies. Hmmmm! </p><p><strong>You can do better Tom. Think outside the box!</strong></p><p><strong>The Eureka moment!!! </strong> Wouldn't it be cool if I could use my phone/camera like a GoPro? What if I could somehow make a smartphone holder to replace all those gadgets. A stabilizer / mount / holder / stand / dash mount /multi tool / for any size smartphone. I could use it in the car, at home, at work and at play. I could reel in that whopper fish hands free. Then, unlike the others, my smartphone is a Computer / HD Camera. I can view, edit, and upload my footage quickly and easily, or download for creative editing. I even live streamed at the fair.</p><p><strong>My Mission...

Multifuntional By Design. Thank you for viewing. I seek your support bringing to market my latest invention, The Eye Shooter!Turns any good photo video shooter into a Steven Spielberg by helping them capture photos and videos much more creatively. Your head / body can be a natural stabilizer when using the Eye Shooter, especially in hands free headband mode.More than a headband, it was designed for steady hand held photo-video recording using 3 point stabilization. Smartphone cameras are getting better and better technically, but are not designed for holding. The Eye Shooter was designed to hold your phone/camera, you hold the Eye Shooter. This opens up a whole new world of creative possibilities for millions of smartphone users and photo video enthusiasts worldwide. What's possible? See for yourself in this live as it was shot answer to the question ""will my phone fall off?""
 I met Walter Murcia, an amazing high wire artist from the Pirates of the Colombian Caribbean.    I asked him to shoot his high wire performance with the eye shooter headband.

Tom the Doc and Walter. He and his  troupe were into it, so they set up a special performance just for us to record. We shot it all in one take. I was handheld A cam and Walter B cam headband. This is the complete as it was recorded footage 2 cam edited.                    Run time aprox 10 minutes.
 
When smartphone video went HD, as a pro photo videographer, I became more interested in them. The new cameras surpassed my pro SD video cameras. But alas, less than ideal to hold, let alone get creative with. What good is shaky 4k quality video? With the exception of common shots, holding a phone’s camera is not like using a DSLR or video camera. Only high end phones have optical image stabilization. Forget about zooming in without shake. So all kinds of gadgets, holders, and sticks came about, all are 1 trick ponies. Hmmmm! You can do better Tom. Think outside the box!The Eureka moment!!!  Wouldn't it be cool if I could use my phone/camera like a GoPro? What if I could somehow make a smartphone holder to replace all those gadgets. A stabilizer / mount / holder / stand / dash mount /multi tool / for any size smartphone. I could use it in the car, at home, at work and at play. I could reel in that whopper fish hands free. Then, unlike the others, my smartphone is a Computer / HD Camera. I can view, edit, and upload my footage quickly and easily, or download for creative editing. I even live streamed at the fair.My Mission... Design and Create an affordable multi function smartphone holder for everyday applications, steady photo videography and just for having fun! How much fun? See the playlist of what we captured at the Altamont Fair in upstate NY.  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfteGwlH  Everybody had a big smile on, just like IE my mascot/logo, got to love IE and that smile. What do you think of IE? Keep him or what. Please Comment, should I include a IE T Shirt as a perk?My friends call me the doc,  a lifelong sometimes wacky inventor, a lot like the doc from Back to the Future. I am the Inventor of The Quad Pod Video Camera Stabilizer, The Aero Pod Grow Systems and the Chip Sliders Roulette stackers and trackers. The Prapala, a self propelled fishing lure. and the Aqua Web hand swim fins, ( coming soon if when this campaign succeeds) just to name a few. So I did my thing. Pondered. Created a few drawings. Made clay models and then a few prototypes for proof of concept. All you inventors out there never give up, keep on inventing until you get there. I failed so many times and came close but no cigar, to not even trying anymore. Naaaaaaaa. One more time.......soI hired a great cad designer, Dorian from Catz Design now in Colorado, Thanks my friend. Together we successfully developed the amazing final designs.This was the final design and we have since went on to complete the tooling of injection molds and make a small run, and in production. We need the funding for next scale of production runs and bring it to market. The hardest part and with your help, we will not fail due to lack of proper funding.Please, I don't want to go on shark tank, IE says ""Mr Wonderful will put me in a martini or something. Mark Cuban will use me as a basketball. Barbera will want to set me up in her NYC penthouse....as a pet. Laury will endlessly parade me on QVC and Robert will turns his kids on me."" I will ask IE what he thinks about those guys out in Texas! One of my best inventions is the Quad Pod Pro video camera stabilizer. I created the Eye Shooter based on the 3-4 point stabilization principles and benefits of the Quad Pods. My model here, Chelsie, went on to Playboy.That experience led me to develope: The EYE SHOOTER Smartphone Holder and HEADBAND Mount and it's no 1 trick pony. DASH MOUNTABLE  with a stick-on dash mounting clip. Mount it anywhere on your Dashboard. It's great for hands free talking, using GPS or as a Dash Cam. I use it everyday.TRIPOD MOUNTABLE. The main eye ball Socket easily mounts to monopods, tripods, and any tripod adaptors with standard 1/4"" 20 thread. Really came in handy setting up stationary shots.DO FACIES and MIRIES  (just look at people or into any mirror when using selfie viewcam) the selfish stick is a one trick pony, long live the FACIE!Built in Holder for Led Light. Used to adjust Line of Sight and extra fill light for filming at night. I would like to develope a laser pointer that has a on off button. Very few have. It would be perfect for the eye shooter. I have the experience and you can help make it happen. The headband features a neoprene pad so lite and comfortable Mr Sheep forgot he had it on. Ask my new friend here how it adjusts to fit all, from a child's head to pumpkin size. We even mounted them on a Pony, Elvis the Horse and my new friend here, Mr Sheep.The innovative strap design doubles as a headband and a neck strap so you can use your smartphone just like a camera. It's not a bulky 2 part velcro but a special stick to itself material. It's lite and comfortable and needs no buckles. The creative product development process has been very successfully completed.  For most new product makers, that's the hardest part. For me, it's always been challenging but still the easy part. It's what I do well. My proof of concept testing is done. Cad design and 3D prototypes made, tested, and improved upon. Final tooling of steel injection molds completed.I own the tooling and all the eye shooters will be made in the USA. Our first small run is complete and I have limited inventory to fulfill delivery to early contributors. We have completed the test market phase having introduced the Eye Shooters at a few NY State County fairs. The response was totally positive. Everyone that had a chance to see and shoot with it were impressed with its multi-function capabilities and low price point.Now comes the next run of production and letting the world know it exists. It's one thing to invent a great product ready for sales but now I need to raise funds to produce it and bring it to market.As a contributor to my campaign I am offering a number of perks which include getting complimentary Eye Shooters at certain levels.  I know you will agree that an inexpensive alternative to GoPro type cameras and 1 trick pony gadgets would be very well received.There are billions of smartphones worldwide. The eye shooter works with  most of them. And it makes people smile ala facies, we need a lot more of those in this world.The Eye Shooter project has satisfied and surpasseds all my design goals and expectations. Now, after many revisions and improvements, it's ready, and I Love it!!!!! You will too.  I guarantee it.  Thank you for your support my friends. Tom the doc Barrera",4.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>LokDon</strong> --This provides users and devices a means to connect in a secure manner with ones privacy intact.</p>
<p>We are team of boundless collaborators of information technology. Our team noticed that the main encryption system (AES) for securing all communications over the internet is threatened. So we created a patent-pending encryption instruction codes to address that. The world needed something better than what we have now since more powerful computing can be leveraged by cloud services and super-computing in favor of device compromises. We decided to build a system based on the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Localized Core generators of encryption keys and password and passphrases.</p>
<p>2.  Implored the Russian ‘Matroyshka’ doll ensemble to make the keys impregnable.</p>
<p>3. On-the-fly generation of keys instead of storing the keys.</p>
<p>4. Increased encryption capacity by eight times or more of AES the status quo in both decryption and encryption engine</p>
<p>5. Make the new technology tune-able for quantum computing by using ever changing scopes.</p>
<p>6. The bottom line is that this works perfectly well on mobile devices because they are already constrained in Storage, CPU and RAM.</p>
<p>7. We also involved smart encryption to check the storage, cpu and ram size before encryption or decryption.</p>
<p>8. Adaptable anywhere encryption is needed: IoT and Desktops and server Applications plus Web Application and other Services.</p>
<p>We created this site <a href=""http://www.lokdon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.lokdon.com</a> to show you the scholarly work done and the prototype under test; sample. You can find the LokDon.apk for android there. We want to show you our integrated application’s User Interface and User Experience: We are building this as a startup in deploying a secured communication line of products for the future. If you support us you will get a free use of this application when it is finished. We have not decided on the licensing method for now but your support will encourage us to do what is right for the people that made it possible in building lokdon.--(Please lock down your mobile devices).</p>

I know that the cost could be more but don't worry I will cover it with my resilient effort.  I promise you that within 6 months we will give you the privacy you need as long as our goal is reached.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Our base technology is outstanding in all areas tested. We have no fear that it is here to stay. The fact that you are reading this right now is the confidence we have that you will understand the work we have put in to bring this knowledge to you. </p>
<p>In a dynamic world there is no better way to change a single thing if we can not acknowledge a better idea and make it flourish. We can test it for ourselves and become convinced: It is also our duty for us to make it a public knowledge to educate others in a better way of doing things. This we must do in order to preserve wisdom and the dignity of humanity.</p>
<p>All donation will be put to use as stipulated  and all perks will be disbursed accordingly. The encryption between the internet and your computers, car, IoT and handheld devices will be done seamlessly regardless of the capacity. You will be able to re-gain and maintain you privacy once again.</p>

<p></p>

Compact 1500 mAh power bank and wall socket charger in one
A compact and clever 2-in-1 charger for your mobile devices: a Li-Polymer battery power bank with a wall socket charger.



A powerbank, however capacious it is, is never enough. Add a wall charger, and the energy supply will be unlimited – wherever you go.



This compact wall socket charger with Li-Polymer battery fits in your palm. Put it into your pocket or bag – it does not take up much space and weighs about a third of a pound.




Run out of juice? Urbanical charger helps you on the go!



A 1500 mAh power bank will breathe life back into your phone or tablet when you’re outdoors.


A wall socket charger comes to the rescue if the power bank is already empty, and there is still much work to do.







Li-Polymer battery (2 cells)
USB output:1000 mA5 V
Wall socket input:600 mA90-220 V
The LED indicator shows current power capacity and blinks while charging.  It has a funny cat’s face.

We are not new to the manufacturing process and our production factory is quite reliable, so we are confident that we can produce and deliver Urbanical Charger to all our contributors within a reasonable time frame.


Nevertheless, we cannot 100% guarantee the date of delivery we declared on the timeline here. We only can assure you that we will make every effort to be true to our word.

And of course we will keep you informed about our progress.

<h3>myAAC: A Product with Life-Changing Benefits</h3>
<p>Hello!  We are a group of three high school seniors looking to make a lasting impression on the world.  Our project, named myAAC, comes from a class offered in our school called Biomedical Design and Development.  To start off, our budget was $40, an amount that won't even pay for our lab fees for one day.  As a result, we've turned to Indiegogo in hopes that we can raise enough money to make our invention a reality.  </p>
<p>Within the first month of school this year, we had decided on our task for the year: to create a working case for speech devices, or AAC devices, that are used by non-verbal people all over the world.  It's been a problem for years, and we aim to solve it as effectively as possible.  These devices are expensive, most of the time upwards of $5,000, and with the extra expenses most of these families face, buying another one is out of the question.  To reduce the chances of one of these devices breaking, we have designed a specialized case that we believe can end this possibility once and for all.  We would be one of the only cases on the market designed for these devices, and the only built specifically for protection.  The only way that this goal can be achieved is with your help.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>As our project has reached the point where we need to build a prototype, and eventually a final product, we realized quickly that our $40 budget was not going to be enough to make our case.  To find out just how much we needed, we completed a cost analysis to find out how much it would eventually come out to.  Between buying materials, getting lab time, making molds, and eventually getting a patent, we came up with a total goal of $10,000.  Most of this will be going towards our patent, which will give us control over our product and out of the hands of companies looking to make as much money as possible.  Our very first case is being made specifically for a young student at The Langan School in Albany, NY, but we don't want to stop there.  We hope to take it further, and possibly create our own company out of our idea which can hopefully help us get through college. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We aim to have a worldwide impact on the disabled community, making their lives easier by eliminating the worry of breaking their communication device.  Our project is valuable in that it is something that hasn't been created before, and is a huge improvement on what's available on the market.  Investing in our project will help ease the costs put on families with non-verbal children, and it will impact the disabled population in a positive way.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Getting to our goal will be no easy task, but it's one that we are determined to achieve, and most of all do it the right way.  If four years of high school has taught us anything, it's that the most challenging projects are the ones that are the most rewarding in the end.  As a group, our perseverance is strengthened by our passion for our product, and the idea that it could have such a positive impact.  An obstacle that we are bound to hit at some point during our project is improving upon our prototype once tests are finished.  Our plan for this, if any problems come up, is then to brainstorm, and design an idea that we all agree on.  Brainstorming is what got us here in the first place, and it has not failed to bring about new, innovative ideas. </p>

<p>If you aren't able to donate at this time, we would ask kindly that you spread the word to anyone who would be willing to listen.  The more people that we have supporting our campaign, the more opportunity we have to help those in need.  And also, don't forget to share our campaign on social media, as well as right here on Indiegogo!  It's only a few steps, and it would help us out tremendously.  Thank you so much for your interest in myAAC, and hopefully we succeed in Protecting the Voice of the Voiceless. </p>

<h3>How we got started</h3>
<p>60x started as a project at the Australian Science and Mathematics School, where we were exploring ways which we could engage students in science, by empowering them to explore the world around them. We came across a phone attachable microscope designed for currency checking that kids loved. With this, we have run many successful sessions in schools across Australia. We have run hundreds of workshops with schools, museums, and science events, as you can see here &gt; <a href=""http://www.60x.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.60x.co</a> . Through this experience, we realized the limitations of the current version.

<li>Multiple-lens system - to create a crisp magnified image, with much less distortion and chromatic aberration than single lens or bead designs</li>
<li>Full-screen image - we use a lens close to the phone to capture a large view from the camera</li>
<li>No external lighting required - by reflecting the light from the camera's flashlight, we can light up an object in day or night</li>

The Gavin Moto Mod bridges that gap and makes us more efficient in connecting our lives.  Once connected to the Galvin Moto Mod the Moto Z series not only becomes the faceplate of the stereo, but also the source of your music, navigation, personal assistant, and so much more.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>The Convenience You Take Everywhere</i></p><p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">The smartphone is no longer a peripheral device or personal assistant, it’s become an extension of ourselves and a branding of how we identify ourselves.  From the wallpaper background to the specific apps which connect us to our friends and family, smartphones carry our personality, music, and home… so why not our transportation too.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>A Synergy Between Your Personality and Your Vehicle</i></p><p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">We’re watching the smartphone evolve and by transforming the smartphone with the Galvin Moto Mod you’re not only integrating your Moto Z phone into your vehicle but also collaborating the smartphone and vehicle to be resourceful and ingenious.  It’s more than just a “smart” phone when connected to the Galvin Moto Mod, it becomes a “brilliant” phone.  Just like your phone, your vehicle is an extension of your personality and what better accent to your vehicle than your phone. Once installed the Galvin Moto Mod is the largest and most diverse looking Moto Mod ever created as it takes the shape of your vehicle.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Integrating Driver Safety</i></p><p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">Safety on the road is critical to protecting our family and friends.  By physically taking the phone out of hands of drivers the Galvin Moto Mod creates safer roads and driving habits in a world where always connected is causing accidents, many of which are taking our loved ones away.  The Galvin app will include functionality which promotes driver safety and will integrate new “Ease of Use” controls, along with Google Assistant to access many Google services you use to get to your destination safely and enjoy your drive, all while supporting safety on our streets and highways.</p><p>By integrating the Galvin Moto Mod into your vehicle, you're creating the largest Moto Mod as it's virtually not an extension of what you drive, but a continuation of your personality and all the hard work you put into organizing your life with your smartphone.  Galvin is the transition to collaborate your life.</p><p> </p><p><strong>It's Truly a Motorola Once Again</strong></p><p>The Galvin Moto Mod brings Motorola back to its roots.  Motorola began not as a company but as a product brand name in 1930.  It was a brand created by Paul Galvin, one of two brothers (the other being Joseph) who founded Galvin Manufacturing Corporation in 1928.  While Motorola products were not the first or only products produced by Galvin Manufacturing Corporation, the Motorola brand was so well known that Galvin Manufacturing Corporation changed its name to Motorola.  The Galvin Moto Mod is a homage to the success of the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation’s Motorola car radio products and serves to bring the Motorola we know today, back to the brand and product its famous namesake is based.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Resource Requirements</strong></p><p>The core needs for the Galvin Moto Mod project is in the acquisition of necessary resources.  All these items are allocated directly to the project and <strong><u>ZERO</u> </strong>of the funds will be used for personal salaries, wages, or compensation of any kind to myself.  This project is to expand the potential to create efficiencies and safety in our lives and as such the funds will be used to acquire only the resources required to develop this Mod (Stipulation: If the campaign funds exceed 250% of the goal, more outsourcing of software consulting services may be used to expedite the App development).  Funds will be used to purchase resources in developing, prototyping, and launching the product of this project such as:</p><ul>
<li>Raw materials (e.g. Electronic Components, DIN Cases, etc.)</li>
<li>Equipment and hardware (e.g. 3D Printer, Testing Meters, Oscilloscope, etc.)</li>
<li>Software Consulting – <i>Minor Use </i>(e.g. App Development Support, etc.)</li>
</ul><p>Early prototypes are currently in-progress but the resources provided by the campaign funds will expedite much of the development process.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><p>Support for this Indiegogo campaign means you want more out of the products you already own and care about safety on our roads.  The following perks are available when you pledge to this campaign:</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong><u>$350 Pledge</u></strong></p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Essentially a three-fer offer.  Receive a prototype, Early Bird Special on the Galvin Hardware, and two Galvin Apps codes.  Shipping included on hardware and Galvin hardware will include an app code so you get two (4) App codes.  Only six (6) $350 Pledges are available.</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong><u>$150 Pledge</u></strong></p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Early Bird Special on the Galvin Hardware and a Galvin App code Perk.  Galvin hardware will include an app code so you get two (2) App codes.</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong><u>$100 Pledge</u></strong></p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">The Galvin Maker Kit.  This perk is for makers who love a project. This includes all hardware, components, and instructions for that do-it-yourselfer who loves to build. This project is a must for a Maker with a Moto Z. Soldering is required. Shipping included on hardware and the hardware kit will include an app code so you get two (2) app codes.</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong><u>$35 Pledge</u></strong></p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Family Galvin App Perk - Receive five (5) Galvin App codes.</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong><u>$15 Pledge</u></strong></p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Good Things Come In Twos Perk – Receive two (2) Galvin App codes.</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong><u>$8 Pledge</u></strong></p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">The Galvin App Perk – Receive one (1) Galvin App code.</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong><u>$1 Pledge</u></strong></p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Say you care about this idea and receive a thank you email.  Every little bit counts so show your support with what you can give.</p><p>App codes will be distributed once the app is ready for market.  Android is the foundation of the Moto Z series phones and will be the focus and initial launch OS of the Galvin App.  A flexible goal was selected to push this project whether the goal was achieved.  If the goal is not met all funds still go to the development of the Galvin Moto Mod and all perks will be honored for those who pledged.  Prototypes may not contain the same functionality as the final Galvin hardware.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>While I began this project only as a personal goal to create my own Moto Mod for my vehicles (I enjoy classic cars which really didn’t have any tech in them), I began to see the opportunity to create a safer way we get to our destination and be more resourceful with our smartphones.  The idea of Galvin is threefold:</p><ol>
<li>Create a Moto Mod hardware to quickly integrate our smartphones into our vehicles;</li>
<li>Take the phones out of our hands so we can focus on driving; and,</li>
<li>Develop new, safer efficiencies for interacting with the audio device in our vehicles.</li>
</ol><p>The potential is exponential, particularly when looking at the advancement of personal assistants in our smartphones.  The opportunities are endless and moreover will truly impact how we interact with our vehicles.  The objectives of this project are to make better use of what we already took the time to organize in our phones and create a safer driving environment by:</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Reducing the time take to interact with our audio devices</i></p><p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">Allowing drivers more time to focus on driving and the vehicles it shares on the road, safer roadways become an outcome.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Better use of your media</i></p><p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">You already organize your music, playlists, and essentially your life on your smartphones so making better use of what you spent your precious time organizing makes you more efficient.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Elasticity of the App</i></p><p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">The hardware and App are developed to work as a seamless integration for those with a Moto Z Series smartphone, but the idea of creating efficiencies and safety in our vehicles will have a greater impact the more it is utilized.  Thus, as a secondary objective once the hardware and App are completed, porting the app to be used outside the Moto Mod will further the values and goals of the Galvin project.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>When developing an interface device for vehicles, the developer can tread a fine line between trying to integrate functionality while maintaining safety.  Too much integration of services can reduce the safety factor from the device and app, while not enough functionality renders the hardware and app ineffectual.    Finding the correct balance will take time to test, review, and revise to meet the needs of this project.  If not guided by structure and predefined objectives, this project can easily deviate from its intended purpose.  As such, the following mission, vision, and values are established:</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Mission</i></p><p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">Creating hardware and software which better utilizes smartphone services while promoting vehicle operator safety.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Vision</i></p><p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">To get every driver to their destination safely while enjoying the drive.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Values</i></p><p style=""margin-left:.75in;"">Safety before functionality.  Two aspects are competing for the performance quality in this project: Safety and Functionality.  The values thus define a priority for decision-making during this project. </p><p>The challenges facing this project align with the development plan as this project contains two main products: The Galvin Hardware and the Galvin App.  The development plan is summarized by the following outline:</p><ol>
<li>Develop the Galvin Hardware</li>

The Gavin Moto Mod bridges that gap and makes us more efficient in connecting our lives.  Once connected to the Galvin Moto Mod the Moto Z series not only becomes the faceplate of the stereo, but also the source of your music, navigation, personal assistant, and so much more.The Convenience You Take EverywhereThe smartphone is no longer a peripheral device or personal assistant, it’s become an extension of ourselves and a branding of how we identify ourselves.  From the wallpaper background to the specific apps which connect us to our friends and family, smartphones carry our personality, music, and home… so why not our transportation too.A Synergy Between Your Personality and Your VehicleWe’re watching the smartphone evolve and by transforming the smartphone with the Galvin Moto Mod you’re not only integrating your Moto Z phone into your vehicle but also collaborating the smartphone and vehicle to be resourceful and ingenious.  It’s more than just a “smart” phone when connected to the Galvin Moto Mod, it becomes a “brilliant” phone.  Just like your phone, your vehicle is an extension of your personality and what better accent to your vehicle than your phone. Once installed the Galvin Moto Mod is the largest and most diverse looking Moto Mod ever created as it takes the shape of your vehicle.Integrating Driver SafetySafety on the road is critical to protecting our family and friends.  By physically taking the phone out of hands of drivers the Galvin Moto Mod creates safer roads and driving habits in a world where always connected is causing accidents, many of which are taking our loved ones away.  The Galvin app will include functionality which promotes driver safety and will integrate new “Ease of Use” controls, along with Google Assistant to access many Google services you use to get to your destination safely and enjoy your drive, all while supporting safety on our streets and highways.By integrating the Galvin Moto Mod into your vehicle, you're creating the largest Moto Mod as it's virtually not an extension of what you drive, but a continuation of your personality and all the hard work you put into organizing your life with your smartphone.  Galvin is the transition to collaborate your life. It's Truly a Motorola Once AgainThe Galvin Moto Mod brings Motorola back to its roots.  Motorola began not as a company but as a product brand name in 1930.  It was a brand created by Paul Galvin, one of two brothers (the other being Joseph) who founded Galvin Manufacturing Corporation in 1928.  While Motorola products were not the first or only products produced by Galvin Manufacturing Corporation, the Motorola brand was so well known that Galvin Manufacturing Corporation changed its name to Motorola.  The Galvin Moto Mod is a homage to the success of the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation’s Motorola car radio products and serves to bring the Motorola we know today, back to the brand and product its famous namesake is based. Resource RequirementsThe core needs for the Galvin Moto Mod project is in the acquisition of necessary resources.  All these items are allocated directly to the project and ZERO of the funds will be used for personal salaries, wages, or compensation of any kind to myself.  This project is to expand the potential to create efficiencies and safety in our lives and as such the funds will be used to acquire only the resources required to develop this Mod (Stipulation: If the campaign funds exceed 250% of the goal, more outsourcing of software consulting services may be used to expedite the App development).  Funds will be used to purchase resources in developing, prototyping, and launching the product of this project such as:
Raw materials (e.g. Electronic Components, DIN Cases, etc.)
Equipment and hardware (e.g. 3D Printer, Testing Meters, Oscilloscope, etc.)
Software Consulting – Minor Use (e.g. App Development Support, etc.)
Early prototypes are currently in-progress but the resources provided by the campaign funds will expedite much of the development process. PerksSupport for this Indiegogo campaign means you want more out of the products you already own and care about safety on our roads.  The following perks are available when you pledge to this campaign:$350 PledgeEssentially a three-fer offer.  Receive a prototype, Early Bird Special on the Galvin Hardware, and two Galvin Apps codes.  Shipping included on hardware and Galvin hardware will include an app code so you get two (4) App codes.  Only six (6) $350 Pledges are available.$150 PledgeEarly Bird Special on the Galvin Hardware and a Galvin App code Perk.  Galvin hardware will include an app code so you get two (2) App codes.$100 PledgeThe Galvin Maker Kit.  This perk is for makers who love a project. This includes all hardware, components, and instructions for that do-it-yourselfer who loves to build. This project is a must for a Maker with a Moto Z. Soldering is required. Shipping included on hardware and the hardware kit will include an app code so you get two (2) app codes.$35 PledgeFamily Galvin App Perk - Receive five (5) Galvin App codes.$15 PledgeGood Things Come In Twos Perk – Receive two (2) Galvin App codes.$8 PledgeThe Galvin App Perk – Receive one (1) Galvin App code.$1 PledgeSay you care about this idea and receive a thank you email.  Every little bit counts so show your support with what you can give.App codes will be distributed once the app is ready for market.  Android is the foundation of the Moto Z series phones and will be the focus and initial launch OS of the Galvin App.  A flexible goal was selected to push this project whether the goal was achieved.  If the goal is not met all funds still go to the development of the Galvin Moto Mod and all perks will be honored for those who pledged.  Prototypes may not contain the same functionality as the final Galvin hardware. The ImpactWhile I began this project only as a personal goal to create my own Moto Mod for my vehicles (I enjoy classic cars which really didn’t have any tech in them), I began to see the opportunity to create a safer way we get to our destination and be more resourceful with our smartphones.  The idea of Galvin is threefold:
Create a Moto Mod hardware to quickly integrate our smartphones into our vehicles;
Take the phones out of our hands so we can focus on driving; and,
Develop new, safer efficiencies for interacting with the audio device in our vehicles.
The potential is exponential, particularly when looking at the advancement of personal assistants in our smartphones.  The opportunities are endless and moreover will truly impact how we interact with our vehicles.  The objectives of this project are to make better use of what we already took the time to organize in our phones and create a safer driving environment by:Reducing the time take to interact with our audio devicesAllowing drivers more time to focus on driving and the vehicles it shares on the road, safer roadways become an outcome.Better use of your mediaYou already organize your music, playlists, and essentially your life on your smartphones so making better use of what you spent your precious time organizing makes you more efficient.Elasticity of the AppThe hardware and App are developed to work as a seamless integration for those with a Moto Z Series smartphone, but the idea of creating efficiencies and safety in our vehicles will have a greater impact the more it is utilized.  Thus, as a secondary objective once the hardware and App are completed, porting the app to be used outside the Moto Mod will further the values and goals of the Galvin project. Risks & ChallengesWhen developing an interface device for vehicles, the developer can tread a fine line between trying to integrate functionality while maintaining safety.  Too much integration of services can reduce the safety factor from the device and app, while not enough functionality renders the hardware and app ineffectual.    Finding the correct balance will take time to test, review, and revise to meet the needs of this project.  If not guided by structure and predefined objectives, this project can easily deviate from its intended purpose.  As such, the following mission, vision, and values are established:MissionCreating hardware and software which better utilizes smartphone services while promoting vehicle operator safety.VisionTo get every driver to their destination safely while enjoying the drive.ValuesSafety before functionality.  Two aspects are competing for the performance quality in this project: Safety and Functionality.  The values thus define a priority for decision-making during this project. The challenges facing this project align with the development plan as this project contains two main products: The Galvin Hardware and the Galvin App.  The development plan is summarized by the following outline:
Develop the Galvin Hardware
Create the Galvin App for use with the Galvin Hardware
Port the Galvin App as a stand-alone app for use without the Galvin Hardware

</div></div>","I&Phone is the complete anti-theft smartphone solution engineered to locate lost or stolen phones. With a simple mobile application and I&Phone card, I&Phone's features establish theft prevention measures to provide phone owners a sense of security and ease.


 
 
 


I&Phone can be utilized anytime anywhere. I&Phone is not limited by any particular distance, making all its features function properly and accordingly. Whether your phone is lost at work, school, home, or a long-distance away, I&Phone will be able to help finding its location with no problem.

 



 
 


 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 


 

 


 

 

 


 


 


 


Simply place the I&Phone Card rear the mobile phone (NFC function phone) for wireless charging. Charging time is under 1 hour and battery life is 1 month
 

 
 

 

I&Phone Locker is installed on a user's device. In the case that a user's smartphone is stolen or lost, Locker will prevent the phone from being turned off to allow for it to be located. (supported OS: Android 6.0+)
 

I&Phone Finder is installed on another device. In the case that a user's smartphone is stolen or lost, Finder will assist the user in locating the phone. (supported OS: Android 5.0+)
 

You can install apps automatically using NFC features. If you carry the card behind your phone, you can move to a screen where you can install apps.  
I&Phone can be installed by searching from the Google play App Store
 

Generic anti-theft applications can only track lost or stolen phones when they are turned on. I&Phone Locker, through Protected Mode, prevents the smartphone from being turned off in order to track its location. Furthermore, I&Phone captures photos and videos from the front/rear view cameras to identify the thief in the case that the phone is stolen and sends them directly to the user's email and secondary phone. 
 

 

 

 

I&Phone Card supports Android OS only.Please check the OS of your phone before make a pledge.
 
 

 



When you purchasing the Early Bird, Early Double, Double pack, Family Pack, Group Pack, Mega Pack, we send a free App Code via e-mail. The App is available  use before you received the product.
 
 

 
Iotok Co., Ltd. seeks to develop products and services for “Safe and Fun Outdoor Life”. It has become prevalent that personal information has not been protected and accessed by illegal means. We plan to expand our services to help people in various ways such as kidnap prevention and finding lost pets and stolen goods. Our ultimate goal is to provide safety network services for what you value most.
 

 
 





 
Risk and Challenges
We currently have a functional prototype of I&Phone that is ready for mass production. However, we are aware that there may be necessary changes to meet manufacturing requirements. Our policy is to make sure that our backers are continuously informed of any updates or changes. Our campaign will exhibit full transparency and full updates will be given to our backers when needed. We look forward to providing I&Phone to our backers. Until then, keep your phones safe!

<p><b>Enter Idea</b></p>
<p>For the past year we have been developing StylusFlex. About a year ago I was using a stylus at work and as I was getting ready to leave, I naturally put the stylus back on my desk. On my commute back home I was writing emails and playing a few games - I needed my stylus. Why did I leave it at work? We then realized, the essence of a stylus is somewhat backwards: they’re meant to be used on our touch screens, 98% of which are mobile devices that are used, well... while you're mobile. But the stylus seemed to stay in one place – kept in our office desks or at our homes. So what was the point of a stylus meant for our mobile devices if it's left at home?</p>
<p><b>Enter Action</b></p>
<p>We ventured to solve that problem - to create a stylus that anyone could use and didn’t think twice about bringing with them on-the-go. A stylus that would be comfortable in your hand, but unnoticeable in your pocket. Our first task was figuring out whether it was ""styluses"" or ""styli."" This was hard. Ultimately though, after pondering like Socrates, we left no stones unturned and came to the consensus it was ""styluses.""</p>
<p>Screens are getting bigger! Using a stylus feels natural, like holding a pen, but used on your 21st century touch screen. You can use it when you're drawing, cooking, taking notes, or even when you have gloves on because it's too freezing outside in San Francisco (...meanwhile in Siberia). StylusFlex is unique in its use cases and is the ideal replacement for selfie sticks as they are being banned worldwide, as well as being a great substitute to the $100 Apple Pencil which only works for iPad Pro.</p>

</div></div>","Current power banks on the market are heavy, slow with the wireless charging solution constantly disconnecting with the slightest movement. Due to flaws in their design or external stress, Li-ion power banks can catch fire or explode. At EXCITRUS, we saw these problems and decided to do something about it.
 

 



Introducing EXCITRUS NitroCharge 30, the power bank that is revolutionising wireless charging. The NitroCharge 30 is the world's slimmest and lightest wireless 30W power bank with magnetic positioning to ensure your phone is always charging at the maximum speed, even when you are on the move.








 



Weighing only 0.57 lbs (259 grams), NitroCharge 30 is the lightest and slimmest laptop charging power bank on the market. NitroCharge 30 can easily fit in your pocket, bag, or simply your hand. Carry all the power you need in the palm of your hand, say goodbye to battery anxiety once and for all. Having a portable power source around has never been easier or lighter.

ALL the power banks on the market (30W+, designed for laptop charging) use Li-ion batteries, causing them to be thick and bulky, with a higher risk of combusting.
NitroCharge 30 is the first-ever 30W power bank developed using Li-polymer batteries, a breakthrough in the power bank industry. Resulting in a power bank that is much thinner, lighter and safer compared to the other 30W power banks on the market.

</div></div>","We developed IODD series and have been manufacturing it.The world's leading PC maintenance company and securitycompanies are using IODD.IODD MINI is the next generation of ""IODD-2541"".IODD MINI is USB 3.0 Flash drive with versatile gadget functions.Don't you mind if someone copy your USB drive orconnect your USB drive to virus-infected PC.Don't worry , if you use IODD MINI.
Your drive will be highly protected against hacking oraccidental data loss and infection.For the information of IODD MINI and iODD 2541,please see these pages.
[IODD homepage] [IODD WIKI] [IODD MINI page]
 
 



This is a necessary gadget for you.​ 
For PC engineers, IT engineers.​""Time is gold.""
IODD MINI dramatically reduces your PC maintenance time.External devices that boot up from ISO files with no need for ODD.With the speed of SSD and USB 3.0, IODD MINI is a great performer in the OS installation and the Norton Ghost Program.
For those who need data encryption.​ ""Look before you leap.""
The encryption device is not safe for all devices.Most encryption devices are designed to allow developers to access them.However, IODD MINI is designed so that developers can not solve the password.The password is only known by the person who set it up.IODD MINI is the most secure private encryption drive.
 
​For those who tired of playing hide and seek ""A lock is better than suspicion.""

Your important data.Are you afraid of seeing someone?You know.Finding it very easily foundOnly your drives become complex.Encrypt it as a IODD.No one can access the data.This is a USB Flash drive.It's a little special.
Also IODD MINI has Virtual DVD-ROM emulator,If you can boot from a USB CDROM, then you can boot from IODD MINI.You can easily boot Windows To Go or ISO, VHD images from IODD MINI.Don't waste a blank DVD.Copy all your DVD Blu-ray images or ISO files to IODD MINI,and select what you want to load with browsing button.
So it's handy.
IODD MINI will be something more than IODD-2541.More lightweight and handy and startup keys.Supports "" win-to-go "".You can boot from any PC.(can't compare it with PE.)You can also view data on smart TVs and Android.Of course, you can set up encryption and see only you.You don't need to encryption.Of course.
This is a revolution.
IODD MINI hasreal-time Hardware AES 256-BIT XTS MILITARY GRADE ENCRYPTIONand Selective Write Protection functions.All functions can be used with encryption, and No Software Required.
 
Write Protection function is selective.The last logical safeguard is write protection.Hard wired write protection make your data only read-only.If you want to write something,you can disable write protection temporarily.That's IODD mini
 
 


 
 

 
IODD MINI is superior to all the functions that others have.Speed, Encryption, Write Protection, Virtual DVD-ROM,Mounting VHD, Boot Windows To Go, etc...IODD MINI can be mounted as 5 flash drives and 1 optical drive at the sametime..
 
 

 
 

 
DO NOT burn DISC. Just Copy to IODD MINI.CDs, DVDs cannot be recycled.you have to send it to CD Recycling Center or to throw it to trash bin.Buying CDs DVDs is Environmental destruction.

 

Any OS can boot from IODD MINI with encryption,If the OS supports USB booting.You can also use it in the usual way.
You can use IODD MINI with smart TVs,mobile devices and all devices equiped USB MSD host. 

1.8-inch color LCD makes it even more comfortable.Pull-down menu and Multi-language.Many Startup keys.The LCD provides QR code, if error message occurs.

USB 3.0 supports max 5Gbps transfer speedsand it is more than 10 times comparing with existing 480Mbps USB 2.0.It also supports 900mA which is 80% higher than USB 2.0 (500mA)so data loss rates are remarkably lower.
Benchmark test(Data transfer rate under development)
 
 
 
Real-time Hardware AES 256-BIT XTSEncryption keeps your data safe.Nobody can access encrypted data without password.(even Developer)It is no use hacking or brute-force Attacks.Reset the password to destroy the IODD MINI data forever.No one can ever recover it.
 
 
Write Protection mode is selective.There is one amazing tip.When this mode is ""on"", you can change to ""off"" temporarily.In next connect, the ""on"" mode is preserved.
 

 
IODD MINI supports the  Windows To Go.You can make the whole drive as Windows To Go.Also, you can make VHD image as Windows To Go.and IODD MINI can boot the VHD image.Of course you can use it with encryption mode.

Think of the Fn key of laptops, but unlike laptops, there is not one but three layer-switcher keys, namely Mod, Fn, and Mouse. These three, in addition to the Base Layer, give you four separate layers.</p><p>Please realize that touch typists all around the world only utilize nine of their ten fingers on regular keyboards because everyone presses space with either the left or right thumb, leaving the other thumb unutilized. The Mod keys are strategically placed so that both of your thumbs can be utilized, allowing you to reach the Mod layer’s navigation functionality quicker than navigating on regular keyboards.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479252722/nmjcip9utdmbar1i9pwx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The Base layer contains the regular alphanumeric keys.

It’s also a fully programmable keyboard which can be vastly customized for your needs. If you need a compact, ergonomic keyboard or are looking for the perfect programming keyboard, look no further!Increased ErgonomicsTwo keyboard halves result in a more natural typing posture - rather than forcing your wrists to adapt to a straight keyboard, you can adjust your keyboard so that your wrists are straight. The halves are connected by a bridge cable which expands and shrinks as needed, occupying minimal desk space.The halves connect together securely as one piece, which is useful for transportation purposes or if you happen to prefer a one-piece keyboard.When connected, you can unplug the bridge cable since there are connectors right between the halves that firmly mate upon connection.Improved ProductivityFor maximum touch-typing productivity, you should never leave the home row. Most keyboards have their keys arranged into various blocks, forcing you to leave the home row quite often to access navigation and function keys. The Ultimate Hacking Keyboard, as you will see below, solves this problem with layers.Thanks to the compact design, reaching the mouse is also faster, as your hands only need to travel the minimum distance required.Built to LastHigh-end mechanical key-switches are used for a flawless typing experience. Unlike the switches of regular keyboards, these provide a satisfying tactile feel. They endure not 5 but 50 million keystrokes, do not degrade over their lifetime, and are replaceable.The halves are connected by precision-machined, hardened-steel guides mounted to the stainless steel plates that form the endoskeleton of the keyboard. These guides, combined with a pair of neodymium magnets, not only result in a smooth connect/split experience but also create supreme durability.Take a Closer LookGeek out with a 3D model! You can rotate, zoom, and pan the keyboard rendering. Go full screen to see all the little details, and cycle through the annotations for even more info.Open Hardware, Software, and FirmwareThe UHK was never meant to be a black box. It’s very important for us to open up the design so that you can infinitely customize it to your needs. We know that this mindset pushes innovation forward and it resonates with many of you. Check out the GitHub repository for releases of UHK firmware, electronics design files, bootloaders, and the configuration application, Agent. With even more to come that will help with unique module design, etc. Key Cluster ModuleThis module features 3 regular keys, 2 buttons and a mini trackball which can also be pressed - acting as an extra button. This is the only currently available module for the left keyboard half.Trackball ModuleThe trackball features excellent precision and usability and is well-suited to be used by a thumb. This module is designed for the right keyboard half.Trackpoint ModuleThe trackpoint surely brings back fond memories for those of you who have owned an IBM ThinkPad laptop in the past. With it, you can not only move the pointer, but click by pressing it. This module is designed for the right keyboard half.Touchpad ModuleThe touchpad shouldn’t be stranger to anyone, given that it’s a part of pretty much every laptop and netbook ever manufactured. This add-on takes it to another level by placing the touchpad where it’s easier to reach - right at the middle of the keyboard. Of course, you can emulate clicking with a simple tap. This module is designed for the right keyboard half.What’s in the BoxFrom top to bottom:
Lock screw and hex key for permanently connecting the keyboard halves if you happen to always prefer a one-piece keyboard.
USB Mini-B to A cable: 1.8 meters long (~6 feet)
Spring cable: 0.35 - 0.65 meter long (~1-2 feet), featuring 4P4C RJ11 connectors
Left and right keyboard halves
Make Your ChoiceWith the UHK, you’ve got options: You can choose keycap labeling, ISO or ANSI configuration, and even the key-switches themselves!Keycap labelingStay tuned for even more labeling options for your UHK! Due to high demand, we’ll be considering alternative layouts like Dvorak and Colemak, as well as labeling for other countries. We’ll be taking a poll to help us make the decisions, so please sign up for notifications (in the text field under the video) if you’d like to shape the future of UHK!Labeling makes a statement about your preferred operating system. Or you can make an entirely different statement, by opting for a completely blank keyboard.ANSI vs ISOANSI and ISO are the two standard keyboard layouts. ANSI is mostly used in the US - and ISO is the international standard set-up. They’re very similar, but ISO has an extra key next to the Left Shift key.Note: the UHK ISO configuration features a bar-shaped Enter, rather than the L shaped Enter keys used on most ISO keyboards.Case colorCustomize your look! Made available as a stretch goal during the campaign, you have four color options for the UHK case besides the standard black.Key-switch typeKey-switch type is the defining factor determining the feel of any keyboard. We offer six switch types, each with their own character and corresponding color.If you’re just not sure which to choose, don’t worry! We suggest simply choosing in a left-to-right fashion - so if the Blue/tactile switches sound good to you, that’s the most popular choice. If Blue doesn’t sound like a good fit, Brown would likely be your next best option. And if not Brown, then choose Red. The first three options are preferred by most.
Blue switches are a great choice for hardcore touch typists since these switches have a highly tactile nature, but they’re the loudest of all so your environment must tolerate some noise.
Brown switches are also a good choice for typists because they’re tactile as well, though a lot less noisy than Blue switches. Given their internal construction these switches are easier to double-tap, making them preferred by gamers.
Red switches are primarily meant for gamers. They’re non-tactile, smooth to press, and super-easy to double-tap.
Black switches are similar to Red switches but stiffer, making them less prone to accidental key presses.
Clear switches are similar to Brown switches but stiffer.
Green switches are similar to Blue switches but stiffer
Bulk discountsIf you’re looking to equip your whole office, or just plan on giving the best presents ever, we’ve got you covered. Buy five keyboards and get them for $207 each (a 10% savings), or get ten keyboards for $195 each (~15% savings). Just make your purchase, write “bulk discount” in the comments at checkout, and your discount will be applied on the back-end as a refund. You’ll get a new email confirmation to confirm.The Four Layers of the Factory KeymapLayers provide a way to map multiple functions to a single key. Think of the Fn key of laptops, but unlike laptops, there is not one but three layer-switcher keys, namely Mod, Fn, and Mouse. These three, in addition to the Base Layer, give you four separate layers.Please realize that touch typists all around the world only utilize nine of their ten fingers on regular keyboards because everyone presses space with either the left or right thumb, leaving the other thumb unutilized. The Mod keys are strategically placed so that both of your thumbs can be utilized, allowing you to reach the Mod layer’s navigation functionality quicker than navigating on regular keyboards.The Base layer contains the regular alphanumeric keys. It also includes the Super key, which acts as the Windows key on Microsoft Windows platforms or as the Command key on Apple Macintosh platforms.The mod layer contains often-used navigation and function keys. The Mod keys are thumb activated and thus very easily accessible. You’re able to navigate quickly without moving your hands around, saving you a lot of time over the long run.The Fn layer contains media keys to adjust the volume, navigate across tracks and launch often-used applications. Many of these functions can often be found on laptops.The Mouse layer enables you to control the mouse pointer and trigger mouse clicks and scroll-wheel movements, purely using keys and without leaving your keyboard.Ultimate ConfigurabilityThe factory keymap is just the start! You can redefine the mapping in any way you see fit - and create multiple, custom, application-specific keymaps. Do you prefer exotic layouts? Looking for a Dvorak keyboard or a Colemak keyboard? Or do you want to use the Vim keymap? How about swapping Space and Mod? Any other crazy remapping ideas? Or do you just want to make your life a little easier with some convenient shortcuts? We’ve got you covered!
A number of keymaps can be defined.
Within a keymap there are 4 layers (Base layer, Mod layer, Fn layer, Mouse layer).
By default the base layer is active. Other layers can be activated by pressing the relevant layer switcher key (Mod, Fn, or Mouse). Any key of the base layer can be made a layer switcher key.
Within a layer any action can be bound to any key.
An action can be a key action, mouse action, macro action, or a keymap switcher action.
A key action emits a scancode like “L”, along with optional modifiers, so it can also emit Left Shift + Left Alt + Tab, for example. These shortcuts compose with regular modifiers. A key action can also be dual-role which acts as a normal modifier, like Control when pressed along with another key but behaves as another key like Escape when pressed in itself.
A mouse action is move {left, right, up, down}, scroll {left, right , up, down}, or click {left, middle, right}.
A macro action is a sequence of key actions, mouse actions and delays.
A keymap switcher action switches to the specified keymap.
All the above items must fit into the 32 kbyte onboard EEPROM which basically means dozens of keymaps and macros.
Various other parameters can also be specified such as the speed and acceleration of the mouse pointer.

Quality control will be at the top of the list and most important issue. There are many reasons why the manufacturer's cooperation will not be easy. We understand that Indiegogo backers want their product as soon as possible, but we are limited by factory's capabilities. In our experience, most pre-production samples still have a slight variation from the final mass produced unit.</span></p>

* Smart Charging Chip - detect which type of device is connected and automatically switch between Universal, Apple and Samsung specifications, allowing you to always get the fastest charging speed supported by your device and the USB socket.




TWO TYPES AVAILABLE:



flipCharge SIMPLE - THIS IS CABLE WITHOUT SMART CHIP! For those who want just cable without advanced functions!  This cable is fully reversible and it will charge and both sides of the Type-A work with Sync + Charge.



flipCharge - fully reversible charging cable with SMART CHIP built in directly in USB Type-A connector.






flipCharge is fully reversible charging cable with advanced features.

USB connector with build in Smart Charging Chip;

Strong and durable nylon;

Aluminium connectors;

Tangle free;

120 cm length for optimal use;

Fully reversible;


Our working prototype.







flipCharge is the charger cable your device should have came with. With flipCharge you can charge your device in half the time and get on with your life. 







flipCharge uses new SmartCharge chip, which will  detect which type of device is connected and automatically switch between Universal, Apple and Samsung specifications, allowing you to always get the fastest charging speed supported by your device and the USB socket. 
flipCharge can be connected in two ways. In regular mode it will charge and sync. But in flip mode it will charge your device at max power!




JUST FLIP

AND CHARGE YOUR DEVICE FASTER!




















flipCharge is available in black or white with Lightning or reversible MicroUSB connector.
Lightning for Apple production:
 - iPhone 5,  iPhone 5,  iPhone 5s,  iPhone 6,  iPhone 6 plus
 - iPad mini,  iPad mini 2,  iPad mini 3,  iPad Air 2,  iPad Air 3,  iPad with Retina                display
 - iPod touch 5th Generation  16GB / 32GB / 64GB,  iPod nano 7th  Generation
MicroUSB or Reversible MicroUSB for every mobile phone or tablet PC with MicroUSB:
- Android - Samsung Galaxy, HTC, LG, etc.
- Windows Phone - All versions
- Blackberry - All versions








One of the biggest challenges is the manufacturing process. Quality control will be at the top of the list and most important issue. There are many reasons why the manufacturer's cooperation will not be easy. We understand that Indiegogo backers want their product as soon as possible, but we are limited by factory's capabilities. In our experience, most pre-production samples still have a slight variation from the final mass produced unit.




When will I get to choose the color and model of my flipCharge? 
Few weeks after campaign ends,  backers will be contacted to confirm color choices, and  select between whether they would like the MicroUSB, reversible MicroUSB  or Lightning version.

What if i have changed shipping address since i backed your project and i need it amended?
No problem,when the survey arrives you will be able to amend and verify the shipping address.

Am I supposed to manually add shipping if I'm not in the US?
Yes, you have to add shipping on top of your selected perk. When you pledge, manually add an additional $5 to the price of the perk you want. We will do the matching at the end of the campaign.

What do I do if I forget to pay for shipping?
No problem. Click the contribute now button at the top of the page and manually enter $5. It will be added to your pledge amount. Enter the same personal information you did on your initial order. We will do the matching ourselves at the end of the campaign.

When are you going to be shipping my flipCharge? 
Estimated national and international shipping is Q4 2015

I asked for my perk to be sent to the wrong address! What do I do?
We will be contacting all our contributors few weeks before expected shipping about their product choice. When we do, please respond and let us know the correct address where you would like your flipCharge shipped.

Is flipCharge compatible with the new iPhone 6 and 6 plus? 
It sure is!

What is flipCharge made of?
flipCharge has a durable aluminium enclosure and we use high quality materials for the other parts.

Will flipCharge work with my iPhone case?
We know how annoying it can be to have to remove your case, just to plug in your phone, so we kept the port small to fit with all cases.

Is flipCharge waterproof?
flipCharge is splashproof 

We`ll be glad to answer any of your questions!

<p>If you guys decide to helps us get to the goal budget, we’ll be able to make that dream come true and continue to develop this awesome invention.</p>
<p>This project is very important to us. The Igloophone is getting a lot of enthusiasm and attention from people who get to know it, and we don’t want to disappoint anyone. We want the Igloophone to travel around the world and that every one that needs one will be able to get it, and we are sure that it can help many people just like it’s helping us!</p>
<p>If you cannot invest any money in our project, it really is okay! But if you liked it, do share! Spread the word on social media and tell your friends about it. It would help us just as much.</p>

</div></div>","Do you constantly forget to keep your power banks charged? We've built the perfect system to combat an ever-growing problem. The Novi charges up to 8 portable batteries at once, allowing your entire household to stay charged every day. All you need to do is keep a Novi by the door, and pick one up daily before you leave the house. Pop one back the following morning and exchange it for a freshly charged unit - simple!
 





Each Novi pod is powered by LunaPulse technology. Rather than recharging using standard USB cables, each pod uses magnets instead, and is recharged via magnets. This keeps Novi Pods at low temperatures, optimizing speed charging relative to ensuring safety as a top priority. 
This technology also ensures each Novi Pod charges smartphones super fast, in under 90 minutes. 




















The Novi was designed with ergonomics and portability in mind. Its sleek and compact appearance ensures it stylishly fits into any environment.
We set out to make it the best looking, and efficient charger on the current market. For its exterior we used a matte rubber coat that leaves a smooth finish. It's soft to the touch, and comfortable to grip.


The Novi is also the perfect solution for businesses. Imagine popping into a restaurant and being able to easily charge your phone. Here's how we think it can work best.



























































Seriously, we've done everything to make sure this is amazingly safe.

<h3><b>Our Story</b></h3><p>Hello, we are the minds behind Drive
Control. Our mission is to save lives by stopping cell phone distractions when
driving. These distractions include texting, emails, calls and overall
notifications.  Using your cell phone when driving is a huge epidemic that
is sweeping our nation and causing accidents and deaths.  The families
impacted by these accidents on both sides endure extreme heartache, especially
knowing that it could have been avoided. 
Today, the number of accidents caused by cell phones and driving exceeds DWI.
It needs to STOP.</p>
<p>Here are some statistics:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">82% of all Americans between the ages of 16-17 own cell phones
and 32% admit to texting while driving.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">11 teens die every day because of cell phone distractions. That
is over 4,000 teens a year and does not include their victims.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In 2011,
nearly one in five crashes (17%) were related to cell phone distractions.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our team has created a real App (you
can actually have it on your phone today but we are in testing mode) that holds and silences texts,
calls, and other notifications while driving on both Android and Apple cell
phones.  The App is developed and in it’s
final testing phase.  We are on track to
release the product in March.  Our goal
is to make it FREE to as many people as possible the first year.  </p>
<p>Up to launching our project on
Indiegogo (January 18, 2015), 90% of what you see has been donated.  Nialls, the lead programmer, has dedicated
hundreds of hours working with Google, Android, Apple and writing code. Rhythm
has worked on marketing, meeting with potential donors (which helped us cover the costs of our video) and over all product strategy.  The only person who has been paid is Martin,
the Apple Developer.  Instead of pursuing a full time job, he has been working for us on our project.   He is an amazing coder on
the Apple side and we need him in order to successfully launch the product;
part of our funding will be allocated to keep both of these guys on the development team.  </p><p></p><h3>What We Need To Keep Coding</h3><p>We want to raise $150,000.

Control. Our mission is to save lives by stopping cell phone distractions when
driving. These distractions include texting, emails, calls and overall
notifications.  Using your cell phone when driving is a huge epidemic that
is sweeping our nation and causing accidents and deaths.  The families
impacted by these accidents on both sides endure extreme heartache, especially
knowing that it could have been avoided. 
Today, the number of accidents caused by cell phones and driving exceeds DWI.
It needs to STOP.
Here are some statistics:


82% of all Americans between the ages of 16-17 own cell phones
and 32% admit to texting while driving.


11 teens die every day because of cell phone distractions. That
is over 4,000 teens a year and does not include their victims.


In 2011,
nearly one in five crashes (17%) were related to cell phone distractions.


Our team has created a real App (you
can actually have it on your phone today but we are in testing mode) that holds and silences texts,
calls, and other notifications while driving on both Android and Apple cell
phones.  The App is developed and in it’s
final testing phase.  We are on track to
release the product in March.  Our goal
is to make it FREE to as many people as possible the first year.  
Up to launching our project on
Indiegogo (January 18, 2015), 90% of what you see has been donated.  Nialls, the lead programmer, has dedicated

<h1>Who are we?</h1>
<p>Our startup was founded by two persons in early 2015 in Switzerland. Tarek Al-Atassi from Switzerland, graduated as an engineer in Communication System from SFIT(Swiss Federal Institude of Technologies or EPFL in French), specialized in mobile communication. Tarun Wadhwa is from India, an experienced developer holding a Master degree in Computer Science. This collaboration stems from a long friendship, work and knowledge sharing and alike interests in mobile communication softwares.

<h1>Our story </h1>
<p>After a period of market analysis and with the emergence of new companies such as Jolla and seeing the Ubuntu Touch campaign on Indiegogo, we made a complete survey of the market. I was myself among contributors for Ubuntu Touch, as we use Ubuntu as our main OS on our personal computers.
</p>
<p>As many people we regretted the loss of smart phones such as Nokia N9. We searched for a real alternative and it yielded us to buy two Jolla phones. We then dove into specifications of our first application. We splitted the work to code the backend and the user interface. Today the application's main functionalities have been tested and are working as expected. Programming such application requires strong reverse engineering and proven coding skills. 
</p>
<p><b>We believe in the future of the platform provided by Jolla based on QML/C++/Silica, but we believe more generally that the future will be oriented on multiplatforms frameworks based on linux kernel and programmed by C++ for backends and frontends such as QML/HTML5/CSS3/etc... 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nowadays, there is a real need of alternatives for innovative OS systems such as Sailfish, Ubuntu Touch, Tizen, Blackberry OS, etc and probably others coming up in the future. 
</b></p>
<p><b>We are commited and enthusiastic to work in this field and provide new applications through our new startup UltimateTouch-Softwares for different platforms. 
</b></p>
<p>Our first realisation is SPCC (SMS&amp;Phone Control Center) software that we present here in this campaign. We are currently developing it and will be available to sell soon.
</p>
<h1>Why Jolla phone? Ubuntu phone?</h1>
<p>Nowadays we have been told about the tracking of people by companies and governments, and we find softwares full of advertisements bugging the users without talking about virus and malwares. </p>
<p>It is a general problem in closed source OS, the user cannot know what the OS does, in fact the OS manages what the user can do. In Open Source it is the opposite, you can know what the OS does for you.</p>
<p>Jolla is using open source linux kernel for their Sailfish OS, and Ubuntu as well. They both have no advertisements in their softwares and high level of security with much less problem of virus and malwares. But most of all, they use compiled native code efficient and real multitasking. It is not interpreted pseudo code. This make the phone using less resources and make it run fast. Sailfish requires much less resources while being able to run android application.</p>
<p>Jolla Phone is a new way of thinking. Their OS is ""unlike"" and based on innovative gestures. On Jolla site, you can read:</p>
<h3>""The world doesn’t need yet another smartphone – it needs a new way of thinking.""</h3>
<p>Jolla provide an independant OS that offers a  certain level of privacy (of course if they do not install android application that might track the user...)</p>
<p>We invite you to visit the site of <a href=""http://www.jolla.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jolla</a> for those who do not know this innovative company. We remind you that Jolla is among the best startup in the world and since more than one year they have provided their unlike Sailfish OS ahead of Ubuntu phone.</p>
<h1>Why Crowdfunding</h1>
<p>First of all, our ambition today is to create a company and to provide more softwares to the community of users of Jolla phone and Ubuntu phone as well, in a short future. To create a company, you need assets too and cash to manage development related activities. Until now, we financed all by our own resources and we feel limited without a real push. </p>
<p>We  planned to ask the community of users of Jolla phone to support us and our development for SPCC by using crowdfunding to make a real push in our personal investment and to sense the interest of the community for our work.</p>
<p>We live in a world where most banks do not play their initial role to support small businesses and startups since the world crisis occured. It became more and more complicated to raise in a reasonable time funds from them.</p>
<h1>How the funding will be used</h1>
<p>We need to finance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phones, tablets:   for development and intensive real time tests  before release.</li>
<li>Computer hardware: without computer we can not code, and actually we would need a new computer and a new screen.</li>
<li>Web Development (shop, may be a forum)</li>
<li>Assets to officially register our company to the commerce chamber.</li>
<li>Lawyer's fees and so on...</li>
</ul>
<h1>Where we go</h1>
<p>In the case our campaign succeeds, we will be able to speed up further developments and make new applications. We are planning to convert our site into a shop and may be, offer a forum.</p>
<p>We have been developing many ideas, that will be disclosed at right time.</p>
<h1>What we offer</h1>
<ul>
<li>SPCC softwares  for Sailfish and possibly  for Ubuntu (version coming up).</li>
<li>We offer full commitment for developing professional applications and excellent support to our customers.</li>
<li>We want to provide smart softwares to the community of new OSs.</li>

</div><br/><p><br/></p></div>","Who We are and Why are we doing this? Meet some of the people behind World At Competition startup, the web platform that aims to empower youngsters with opportunities* worldwide.
We are small, young but motivated team that truly represents the world:  
Denys, Ukraine, CEO and Founder (currently in Portugal); 
Hasan, Bangladesh, Developer; 
Dima, Ukraine, Designer (currently in Bulgaria);

Yuri, Ukraine, International Coordinator (currently in Estonia);

Diletta, Italy, PR (currently in the USA). 
 Each of us has tried some kind of exchange program, volunteering, won a grant or achieved a scholarship. We also know how difficult and time-consuming it is to find relative opportunities. That is why the team came together to change that with one simple solution under World At Competition.
While we planned to deliver beta for the first users by November 3rd, a little problem seemed to undermine our mission.



Laptop or Nothing Back to the topic:  Our Designer lost any chance to recover his old laptop; Crowdfunding is the last option we try now (and it's always been; check out previous campaigns of Denys and Dima to understand the value they created with help of IndieGoGo community); This campaign is fast and relatively unprepared due to the urgency of the problem: if the Designer has no laptop, we would not be able to deliver a prototype on time;
However, if we do, you'll co-found a promising startup that will unite some of the brightest youths from around the Earth;
Only 7 days, only full amount, only with your help. 
   Choice explained Dima needs MacBook Pro with 15"" Retina display as   it is perfect for design work due to its resolution, especially if you perform in tech and art (you want that amazing picture, right?); the power of this model resolves pain with big projects (and literally saves nerves and time);



Andy from My Tech Methods explains it in detail; the amount we raise reflects the price of the laptop at the local Apple store in Sofia, Bulgaria (where the Designer is currently based) and does not include IndieGoGo commission.
