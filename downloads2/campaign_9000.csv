Gradually, of particular interest to me became mosses due to their rootless agility that enables them to cover acres of land and all the stories tangled in and hidden underneath the golden green webs. While trying to reveal clues to how a story unfolds, I discovered the mesmerizing shape of Sphagnum – a very popular type of moss. Its cellular structure, the tiny body with a remarkable water capacity, the survival abilities, the talent of purifying the air and detecting pollution equally drew my attention.

A cycle that is never ending just as the search for the meaning of life - curious, doubtful, furious, rootless, imprisoned, and then again - free, connected, absorbing, detecting the poisonous occurrences - inside and out. Moss plants are tiny but wise - they are like expressions of Nature’s higher conscience. What is one mistake we often make? Failing to notice what is going on in our own inner universes.

</p><h3>The Octopussy is a medium size mutant vehicle that will explore
the depths of space and time. A radically illuminated octopus/cat hybrid
creature, the Octopussy, will perch atop a Geo Metro decorated to appear as a
rock in the interstellar ocean.</h3>
<p><b>Description: </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Octopussy has ears and nose like a cat, eyes and tentacles
like an octopus. The entire structure is covered in white projection grade
spandex and internally illuminated by strips of multicolor LEDs connected to a
sound reactive controller.  This gives
the Octopussy the ability to change color and pattern on the fly, much like her
octopus brethren.  Lighting up the night
sky, she will bring joy and wonder to all who lay eyes upon her. In addition,
the car is painted to appear as a rock in the ocean and has interior blue rope
lighting and large plush seating (3-6 people, depending on how snuggly they
want to get).  This underwater lounge
comes complete with a treasure chest! 
The Octopussy is the largest of her kind at approx. 11’ tall x 14’ wide
x 17’ long!</span></p>
<p>Although
she is a mutant vehicle, due to land restrictions, the Octopussy will be a
stationary art piece for her debut at Apogaea in Bailey, CO on June 10,
2015.  But she will be fully mobile and tentacling
about at Element 11 in Stargazer Ranch, UT on July 8, 2015.</p>
<p><b>Background:  </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This large-scale project has been
underway since August 2014 and will take roughly $2450 to come to life. We have
already made some great headway towards this goal by hosting a concert
fundraiser in October 2014 where we raise $670. Since
then, we have been busy building the base structure and are currently stalled
due to lack of funding. We applied for two rounds of Apogaea art grants and
despite our grant applications being rated highly with many positive comments,
we did not receive funding. Although we are disheartened, we are not
deterred!  Anything worth doing does not
come easily and we have been presented with a great opportunity to think
outside the box and be more creative with our resources. As part of this, we
have been crowd sourcing to find materials that can be repurposed for our
project. Thankfully we have a very supportive community that has already
provided many opportunities that we did not know were available.</span></p>
<p>In addition to crowd sourcing for
materials, we are planning to have another concert fundraiser mid-spring which
will hopefully bring us closer to our goal. Fortunately, Kitty and the entire
Octopussy team have plenty of experience fundraising for large theme camps.
Kitty has played a leadership role in 6 different Apogaea/Burning Man theme
camps that were 40-80 people.  The
majority of these theme camps had large-scale art projects like the Octopussy.  Last year, one of the projects was the
Crystal Gardens, which raised $2566 through Indiegogo!  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">( <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/crystal-garden-lighting-installation/x/7116447%C2%A0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/crystal-gard...</a>)</span></p>
<p>The
Crystal Garden project was a major inspiration for the Octopussy! It provided
the general idea of using metal conduit structure wrapped in white spandex
internally illuminated with light strips! 
For the Crystal Gardens, Kitty assisted with multiple aspects of fundraising
and was in charge of fulfilling handcrafted perks to 52 supporters!  In addition, she has 4 years of experience
volunteer managing a Denver sound production company, which has provided many
opportunities orchestrating concert fundraisers.  We already applied for the third Apogaea art
grant round, but the maximum we could be awarded for this art grant is
$600.  We also applied for an Element 11
art grant to fund transportation to bring the Octopussy to Element 11.  Even if we are awarded these art grants, we
still need additional funds to make this project happen!  </p><p><b>How you can help:  </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Octopussy team is working very hard
to bring this project to life and pursuing all possible funding opportunities
including: submitting Apogaea/Element 11 art grants, putting up a donation
booth at the Apogaea art fair, and planning additional concert
fundraisers.  However, even with all
these sources combined, we will need additional funds beyond that to complete
this project. This is where we need your help! 
This Indiegogo campaign is the last piece needed to complete this
fundraising puzzle.</span></p>
<p>With your support, the Octopussy could be swimming the
interstellar ocean near you soon!  </p>
<p><b>Why you should support the Octopussy:  </b>By supporting this Indiegogo
fundraiser, you are bringing immense joy not only to the Octopussy team, but
also to many people in the greater Colorado area!  Being big and beautifully bright, the
Octopussy is eye candy for everyone in her vicinity.  The Octopussy is one of only a handful of art
cars that resides in the Colorado burning community.  So a big, bright, beautiful art car is a
wonderful art installation that will delight many burners year after year!  Once completed, the Octopussy team intends on
bringing her out as much as possible to share this art with thousands of
people!  To all the regional burning man
events that they possibly can for the next few years!  In addition, we will also bring her to the
First Friday Art Walk in Denver during the summer/fall and to Artocade, an art car parade in Trinidad, CO.  The impact of a large, colorful art piece
such as this has the potential to go viral on the internet, delighting people
all over the globe! </p>
<p>This project has been a long-term dream
in the making.  The Geo Metro base of
this art car was previously another art car, the Dubmarine, which was built in
2012 by Kitty and another member of the Octopussy team.  That project was so much fun to work on, so
when this vehicle went up for sale, Kitty jumped at the opportunity to snatch
it up!  Her deep passion for art, music,
cats, and octopi is all coming to fruition at once!  And now, with your help, she has the
opportunity to morph this into the project of her dreams!!!</p>
<p><b>Spread the word:  </b>More
important than anything else, you can support the Octopussy by telling everyone
you know about this art project!  The
more people we can reach, the easier it will be to make her come to life!  Please take a moment to share this page to
all your friends, family, facebook, twitter, or preferred social media!  Be sure to use the Indiegogo share tools!  Thank you so much for your help!</p>
<p><b>Perks:  </b>As
a big thank you for your support, the Octopussy has some nifty thank you
gifts!  She is very crafty, so these
unique perks are handcrafted by the Octopussy herself!  As a beautiful creature, she is eager to send
headshots to all her supporters!  These will
come in the form of stickers and postcards. 
For a daily reminder of her magnificence<u>,</u> the Octopussy will send
you a tentacle refrigerator magnet!  For
those who like to wear cool SWAG, she has tentacle earrings and laser cut
pendants!  Art lovers are in luck because
the Octopussy will custom make tentacle paintings in your favorite colors.  And for the diehard tentacle enthusiasts,
there are tentacle dream catchers!  </p>
<p><b>Where your funds go:  </b>All funds from this Indiegogo will be going towards the
creation of the Octopussy and will not be going towards sound or transportation
of the project to events.  Every penny
raised will go towards this project, regardless if we reach our Indiegogo financial goal.  Our goal is to complete the Octopussy by
Apogaea in June, but we will not stop until she is finished!  If for whatever reason she doesn’t make it to
Apogaea, we’ll bring her to Element 11. 
In the very unlikely situation that we are unable to bring the Octopussy
to either of these events, we will keep working on her and debut this art piece
in September 2015 at Artocade.  We are
determined to bring the Octopussy to life and will continue fundraising and
crowd-sourcing materials until the project is completed.   </p>

<p>The
Geo Metro will have two plywood boards in a cross pattern bolted to the roof
that will provide a sturdy and flat surface to anchor the Octopussy. In the
center of Octopussy board, attached to the plywood with metal L brackets, we
will build a small wooden crate that will house Two JBL JRX100 active monitors
and a 2000W generator. The monitors and generator will attach to the wooden
crate using ratchet straps and bungees to prevent any movement. In addition,
the car will be painted to appear as a rock in the ocean and will have interior
blue rope lighting around all safe entry points into the car. All doors and the
back hatch have been removed as well as all seats besides the driver seat. In
order to provide comfortable seating for all occupants, large plush cushions
will line the rear (formally the back seat and trunk) and the passenger seat
will provide storage for an emergency kit (basic first aid kit, tarps, ratchet
straps and bungees, a bullhorn, and a fire extinguisher), occupants bags, and
will house a small mixer that will provide sound to the two monitors that are
encapsulated in the head.</p>
<p>The
Octopussy has ears and nose like a cat, eyes and tentacles like an octopus. The
entire structure will be covered in white projection grade spandex and will be
internally illuminated by strips of multicolor 5050 SMD LEDs giving the
Octopussy ability to change color on the fly. In addition to being sound
reactive, IR remotes will provide the ability to control the color and pattern
of the lights in real time. We will attach lights to the structure of the
Octopussy with zip-ties in order to illuminate the entirety of the interior.
The tentacles of the Octopussy will be made of 3/4” metal conduit that will be bent
to shape and will connect to metal conduit cubes that are bolted directly on
all four corners to the plywood roof of the Geo. The tips of the tentacles will
be padded with either pool noodles or quilt batting depending on the width of
the tentacle. In addition, each tentacle will also be internally illuminated for
safety and splendor. The head of the Octopussy will be made primarily of PVC
and will have a wooden 4x4 in the center for support. The wooden 4x4 mounted in
the center of roof with metal L brackets and braced on the sides by the two monitors.
If needed, we will add bracing on the front and back of the 4x4 to provide more
support. The base of the head attaches to a PVC collar, which will then attach
to the metal conduit cubes with jumbo 175lbs zip-ties. The ears and nose of the
head will be made from PVC and will attach to the main structure of the head to
provide more stability. In order to give the illusion of an octopus eye, the
eyes will be made of black fabric stitched to the white projection grade
spandex cover with giant googly eye pupils.</p>
Every hybrid creature needs a fuel source and
the Octopussy is no different. In addition to being fueled by beautiful smiles
and dancing feet, the lights and sound will be powered by a 2000W gas generator
that is housed inside the Octopussy's head. 
Since the Octopussy is entirely covered in spandex, proper ventilation
of the head is a must and will be provided by a professional HVAC technician.<br/></div>","The Octopussy is a medium size mutant vehicle that will explore
the depths of space and time. A radically illuminated octopus/cat hybrid
creature, the Octopussy, will perch atop a Geo Metro decorated to appear as a
rock in the interstellar ocean.
Description: The Octopussy has ears and nose like a cat, eyes and tentacles
like an octopus. The entire structure is covered in white projection grade
spandex and internally illuminated by strips of multicolor LEDs connected to a
sound reactive controller.  This gives
the Octopussy the ability to change color and pattern on the fly, much like her
octopus brethren.  Lighting up the night
sky, she will bring joy and wonder to all who lay eyes upon her. In addition,
the car is painted to appear as a rock in the ocean and has interior blue rope
lighting and large plush seating (3-6 people, depending on how snuggly they
want to get).  This underwater lounge
comes complete with a treasure chest! 
The Octopussy is the largest of her kind at approx. 11’ tall x 14’ wide
x 17’ long!
Although
she is a mutant vehicle, due to land restrictions, the Octopussy will be a
stationary art piece for her debut at Apogaea in Bailey, CO on June 10,
2015.  But she will be fully mobile and tentacling
about at Element 11 in Stargazer Ranch, UT on July 8, 2015.
Background:  This large-scale project has been
underway since August 2014 and will take roughly $2450 to come to life. We have
already made some great headway towards this goal by hosting a concert
fundraiser in October 2014 where we raise $670. Since
then, we have been busy building the base structure and are currently stalled
due to lack of funding. We applied for two rounds of Apogaea art grants and
despite our grant applications being rated highly with many positive comments,
we did not receive funding. Although we are disheartened, we are not
deterred!  Anything worth doing does not
come easily and we have been presented with a great opportunity to think
outside the box and be more creative with our resources. As part of this, we
have been crowd sourcing to find materials that can be repurposed for our
project. Thankfully we have a very supportive community that has already
provided many opportunities that we did not know were available.
In addition to crowd sourcing for
materials, we are planning to have another concert fundraiser mid-spring which
will hopefully bring us closer to our goal. Fortunately, Kitty and the entire
Octopussy team have plenty of experience fundraising for large theme camps.
Kitty has played a leadership role in 6 different Apogaea/Burning Man theme
camps that were 40-80 people.  The
majority of these theme camps had large-scale art projects like the Octopussy.  Last year, one of the projects was the
Crystal Gardens, which raised $2566 through Indiegogo!  ( https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/crystal-gard...)
The
Crystal Garden project was a major inspiration for the Octopussy! It provided
the general idea of using metal conduit structure wrapped in white spandex
internally illuminated with light strips! 
For the Crystal Gardens, Kitty assisted with multiple aspects of fundraising
and was in charge of fulfilling handcrafted perks to 52 supporters!  In addition, she has 4 years of experience
volunteer managing a Denver sound production company, which has provided many
opportunities orchestrating concert fundraisers.  We already applied for the third Apogaea art
grant round, but the maximum we could be awarded for this art grant is
$600.  We also applied for an Element 11
art grant to fund transportation to bring the Octopussy to Element 11.  Even if we are awarded these art grants, we
still need additional funds to make this project happen!  How you can help:  The Octopussy team is working very hard
to bring this project to life and pursuing all possible funding opportunities
including: submitting Apogaea/Element 11 art grants, putting up a donation
booth at the Apogaea art fair, and planning additional concert
fundraisers.  However, even with all
these sources combined, we will need additional funds beyond that to complete
this project. This is where we need your help! 
This Indiegogo campaign is the last piece needed to complete this
fundraising puzzle.
With your support, the Octopussy could be swimming the
interstellar ocean near you soon!  
Why you should support the Octopussy:  By supporting this Indiegogo
fundraiser, you are bringing immense joy not only to the Octopussy team, but
also to many people in the greater Colorado area!  Being big and beautifully bright, the
Octopussy is eye candy for everyone in her vicinity.  The Octopussy is one of only a handful of art
cars that resides in the Colorado burning community.  So a big, bright, beautiful art car is a
wonderful art installation that will delight many burners year after year!  Once completed, the Octopussy team intends on
bringing her out as much as possible to share this art with thousands of
people!  To all the regional burning man
events that they possibly can for the next few years!  In addition, we will also bring her to the
First Friday Art Walk in Denver during the summer/fall and to Artocade, an art car parade in Trinidad, CO.  The impact of a large, colorful art piece
such as this has the potential to go viral on the internet, delighting people
all over the globe! 
This project has been a long-term dream
in the making.  The Geo Metro base of
this art car was previously another art car, the Dubmarine, which was built in
2012 by Kitty and another member of the Octopussy team.  That project was so much fun to work on, so
when this vehicle went up for sale, Kitty jumped at the opportunity to snatch
it up!  Her deep passion for art, music,
cats, and octopi is all coming to fruition at once!  And now, with your help, she has the
opportunity to morph this into the project of her dreams!!!
Spread the word:  More
important than anything else, you can support the Octopussy by telling everyone
you know about this art project!  The
more people we can reach, the easier it will be to make her come to life!  Please take a moment to share this page to
all your friends, family, facebook, twitter, or preferred social media!  Be sure to use the Indiegogo share tools!  Thank you so much for your help!
Perks:  As
a big thank you for your support, the Octopussy has some nifty thank you
gifts!  She is very crafty, so these
unique perks are handcrafted by the Octopussy herself!  As a beautiful creature, she is eager to send
headshots to all her supporters!  These will
come in the form of stickers and postcards. 
For a daily reminder of her magnificence, the Octopussy will send
you a tentacle refrigerator magnet!  For
those who like to wear cool SWAG, she has tentacle earrings and laser cut
pendants!  Art lovers are in luck because
the Octopussy will custom make tentacle paintings in your favorite colors.  And for the diehard tentacle enthusiasts,
there are tentacle dream catchers!  
Where your funds go:  All funds from this Indiegogo will be going towards the
creation of the Octopussy and will not be going towards sound or transportation
of the project to events.  Every penny
raised will go towards this project, regardless if we reach our Indiegogo financial goal.  Our goal is to complete the Octopussy by
Apogaea in June, but we will not stop until she is finished!  If for whatever reason she doesn’t make it to
Apogaea, we’ll bring her to Element 11. 
In the very unlikely situation that we are unable to bring the Octopussy
to either of these events, we will keep working on her and debut this art piece
in September 2015 at Artocade.  We are
determined to bring the Octopussy to life and will continue fundraising and
crowd-sourcing materials until the project is completed.

NITTY GRITTY DETAILS FOR THOSE
INTERESTED IN PROJECT LOGISTICS:  
The
Geo Metro will have two plywood boards in a cross pattern bolted to the roof
that will provide a sturdy and flat surface to anchor the Octopussy. In the
center of Octopussy board, attached to the plywood with metal L brackets, we
will build a small wooden crate that will house Two JBL JRX100 active monitors
and a 2000W generator. The monitors and generator will attach to the wooden
crate using ratchet straps and bungees to prevent any movement. In addition,
the car will be painted to appear as a rock in the ocean and will have interior
blue rope lighting around all safe entry points into the car. All doors and the
back hatch have been removed as well as all seats besides the driver seat. In
order to provide comfortable seating for all occupants, large plush cushions
will line the rear (formally the back seat and trunk) and the passenger seat
will provide storage for an emergency kit (basic first aid kit, tarps, ratchet
straps and bungees, a bullhorn, and a fire extinguisher), occupants bags, and
will house a small mixer that will provide sound to the two monitors that are
encapsulated in the head.
The
Octopussy has ears and nose like a cat, eyes and tentacles like an octopus. The
entire structure will be covered in white projection grade spandex and will be
internally illuminated by strips of multicolor 5050 SMD LEDs giving the
Octopussy ability to change color on the fly. In addition to being sound
reactive, IR remotes will provide the ability to control the color and pattern
of the lights in real time. We will attach lights to the structure of the
Octopussy with zip-ties in order to illuminate the entirety of the interior.
The tentacles of the Octopussy will be made of 3/4” metal conduit that will be bent
to shape and will connect to metal conduit cubes that are bolted directly on
all four corners to the plywood roof of the Geo. The tips of the tentacles will
be padded with either pool noodles or quilt batting depending on the width of
the tentacle. In addition, each tentacle will also be internally illuminated for
safety and splendor. The head of the Octopussy will be made primarily of PVC
and will have a wooden 4x4 in the center for support. The wooden 4x4 mounted in
the center of roof with metal L brackets and braced on the sides by the two monitors.
If needed, we will add bracing on the front and back of the 4x4 to provide more
support. The base of the head attaches to a PVC collar, which will then attach

<h3>Painting A New Refugee Home by Nurban Art Project<br/>
</h3> <p>The Nurban Art Project is an organization that has been founded by Julian Vogel, Marco Wegfahrt and Guy Palumbo with the goal of getting as many murals put up in the city of Nürnberg as possible in both the public and private sector.  This is our very first project.  <br/></p>
<p>About two weeks ago, we were informed that there is an office building being converted to house refugees here on Witschelstr. 73 in Nürnberg, and we were asked to donate our time and make this new home for the incoming refugees welcoming and a bit more beautiful.  We happily accepted.  <br/></p>
<p>This project is incredibly important to us because most if not all of the people who will be living in this building have come from incredibly difficult situations in war-torn regions and in many cases have sacrificed all that they have to make the long journey to Europe and land here in Germany.  We want to make sure that we can do our part to make them feel welcome here and also feel like they are moving into a real home after all they have been through.<br/></p>
<p>The artists working on this project will be Julian Vogel and Cris Krieger, both long time mural artists based in Nürnberg, and Guy Palumbo, who will be contributing his first piece of this scale.  Julian and Guy have already gotten started because the scaffolding on the north side of the building is only there for a limited time and Julian will be heading off soon to Baghdad to do his part to make some walls more beautiful over there.  Cris will be painting the west side during the third and fourth weeks of November. The fourth, a collaboration piece, will be done when Julian is back from Iraq, over the course of the last week of November and the first week of December. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>So in order to do these four murals, we need €850 to cover the costs of all the materials for 4 large pieces, 3 of which will be 4 x 9 meters (approx. 13 x 30 feet), and 1 mural that is 2.5 x 9 meters (8 x 30 feet).  It is a respectable amount of real estate to be covered, and we are going to need a lot of paint.  You can see how we are planing to approach the building in the image of the plan which is both at the top of this page and the gallery. Don't let the orange fool you! This is just a sketch, there will be plenty of color on those walls.<br/><br/>While we have some pretty nice perks, you will also be getting is the ability to see exactly what is being done with your money.  We know there are many campaigns that you could give your money to, but with this one you will have four very large murals that you will be able to see online and in person if you ever come to Nürnberg.  <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>This is an office building that has been converted into an apartment building, and it is not in a residential area.  It is surrounded by car dealerships, mechanics and a furniture store.  Getting these paintings up will make this place feel like a home, and that does a lot for the spirits after a long, hard journey to start a new life.<br/><br/>If you want to get an idea of current neighborhood and why there needs to be some concrete beautification, go to google maps, type Witschelstr. 73, Nürnberg, and check it out on street view.  We can make this better.<br/>
</div><div> <h3>Share<br/>
</h3>We are well aware that not everyone has cash that they can donate, so if you would be so kind as to share this project we would be VERY GRATEFUL!<br/>

This art show, SPECTRUM FANTASTIC ART LIVE is a huge opportunity to meet and chat with artists that I've been inspired by since I was a little dude making funny alien drawings. My hope is not just just to stammer around in awe, but to learn from the best of the best.<br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>To further show my excitement, I will be maintaining a website dedicated to my trip.

Since there are too many variables when it comes to a 4000 mile round trip drive, I'll break down my monetary needs the best that I can, and I've tried to be conservative:</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Fuel costs.</b></li></ul><p><i>This is a very long trip and my calculations bring me to about $900-1200 in gas alone.</i></p><ul><li>
<b>Food.</b><br/>
</li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>The wife and I will need to eat! But I assure you, we aren't fancy people that will be eating out all the time. Most of our food we will bring with, and our daily diet will most likely consist of snacks, because we don't have the time to stop and eat everytime someone is hungry. I can't even begin to guess at what this might cost. Cost estimate: $150-200</i></p><ul><li>
<b>Lodging</b><br/>
</li></ul><p><i>On our drive my wife and I will likely be sleeping at rest stops, but when we reach Kansas City, Missouri,  we'll need a place to call 'home' for the 3 day event. My research maintains that hotel/motel rooms can run anywhere from $50-100 per night. We don't need a presidential suite, just a room without bugs.</i> </p><ul><li>
<b>Supplies</b><br/>
</li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Before we venture out, I will need to make sure that I have plenty of prints on hand to sell and business cards to handout. I will also need packaging supplies for all the prints and a few containers to haul things in. Cost estimate: $250</i></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><i><br/></i></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>BECAUSE YOU ARE SUPER AWESOME AND HAVE DECIDED TO DONATE TO MY CAUSE, HERE ARE SOME POSSIBILITIES OF WHAT YOU MIGHT RECEIVE (depending of course, upon what tier you choose):</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><ul><li>
<b>Lower Tier ($1 and $5):</b><br/>
</li></ul><p><i>This tier offers a thank you on my trip website and a hand-written postcard.</i></p><ul><li>
<b>Middle Tier ($10-50):</b><br/>
</li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>The middle tier is an assortment of hand-signed prints sized at 4x6"", 8x10"" and 11x14"". Print size varies depending on what monetary increment you choose. You pick which one you want from the prints that I have available. Below are some examples. Please see the <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/art-show-or-bust/x/6433887?c=gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GALLERY</a> tab above for more choices). But along with that, this level also offers what the lower tier does as well.</i></p><ul><li>
<b>Upper Echelon ($100-500):</b><br/>
</li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>The highest levels offer original paintings (done in acrylic and/or ink, with imagery of your choice*). At $100, you'll get a 5x7"" original painting. At $250, you'll get an original 11x14"" painting. The $100 and $250 perks will also receive the website 'thank you' AND the hand-written postcard, PLUS I'll toss in a shirt for you. At the highest perk level you'll get an original 18x24"" painting, PLUS EVERYTHING from the lower tiers.

Fancy!!!
A massive 'thank you' to ALL the contributers for making this trip of mine possible. Know that you've enabled me to live out a dream!!!SummaryGreetings! My name is Brandon Stewart and I am an artist from Seattle, Washington. For 10 years I have made my living as a freelance illustrator, picking up commissions and illustration jobs. But it's time to start being serious about my career, and this campaign is a step in that direction.For too long I sat neutral without making steps to further my art career. But I finally did it, and signed up to exhibit my art amongst some of the most talented and elite fantasy/sci-fi artists working in the field today, and to my surprise I WAS ACCEPTED. This art show, SPECTRUM FANTASTIC ART LIVE is a huge opportunity to meet and chat with artists that I've been inspired by since I was a little dude making funny alien drawings. My hope is not just just to stammer around in awe, but to learn from the best of the best.To further show my excitement, I will be maintaining a website dedicated to my trip. From the planning stages to the event itself, I will keep all contributers, or you folks that are merely interested, updated with my progress. I'll post photos and videos from the road and let everyone know where I'm at and what I'm doing. Be on the lookout for amazing sunset pictures and nerdy photos of me with some of my heroes!!! Please visit the website here.I have posted some of my artwork (an eclectic mix) in the Gallery (tab above), but if you would like to see more: Go here for my 'darker' artwork, and go here, for some of the cuter, happier work.For more info on SPECTRUM FANTSATIC ART LIVE (and to see my name list amongst the other exhibitors), go to: http://spectrumfantasticartlive.com/By contributing even the smallest amount, I am that much closer to achieving a huge goal that I've had for many years. Thank you so much for your support in advance. Words cannot express how I will feel if this campaign is successful....What We Need & What You GetI am hoping to get together $2000 for this venture. Since there are too many variables when it comes to a 4000 mile round trip drive, I'll break down my monetary needs the best that I can, and I've tried to be conservative:Fuel costs.This is a very long trip and my calculations bring me to about $900-1200 in gas alone.
Food.
The wife and I will need to eat! But I assure you, we aren't fancy people that will be eating out all the time. Most of our food we will bring with, and our daily diet will most likely consist of snacks, because we don't have the time to stop and eat everytime someone is hungry. I can't even begin to guess at what this might cost. Cost estimate: $150-200
Lodging
On our drive my wife and I will likely be sleeping at rest stops, but when we reach Kansas City, Missouri,  we'll need a place to call 'home' for the 3 day event. My research maintains that hotel/motel rooms can run anywhere from $50-100 per night. We don't need a presidential suite, just a room without bugs. 
Supplies
Before we venture out, I will need to make sure that I have plenty of prints on hand to sell and business cards to handout. I will also need packaging supplies for all the prints and a few containers to haul things in. Cost estimate: $250BECAUSE YOU ARE SUPER AWESOME AND HAVE DECIDED TO DONATE TO MY CAUSE, HERE ARE SOME POSSIBILITIES OF WHAT YOU MIGHT RECEIVE (depending of course, upon what tier you choose):
Lower Tier ($1 and $5):
This tier offers a thank you on my trip website and a hand-written postcard.
Middle Tier ($10-50):
The middle tier is an assortment of hand-signed prints sized at 4x6"", 8x10"" and 11x14"". Print size varies depending on what monetary increment you choose. You pick which one you want from the prints that I have available. Below are some examples. Please see the GALLERY tab above for more choices). But along with that, this level also offers what the lower tier does as well.
Upper Echelon ($100-500):
The highest levels offer original paintings (done in acrylic and/or ink, with imagery of your choice*). At $100, you'll get a 5x7"" original painting. At $250, you'll get an original 11x14"" painting. The $100 and $250 perks will also receive the website 'thank you' AND the hand-written postcard, PLUS I'll toss in a shirt for you. At the highest perk level you'll get an original 18x24"" painting, PLUS EVERYTHING from the lower tiers. Also, as an added bonus, I'll throw in my 2013 artbook titled DEPARTURE.*my apologies, but I have to say 'your choice' to an extent.

<p>Da anni
cercavo un posto come questo: un pezzo di terra davanti alla linea
dell'orizzonte dove poter tornare, che fosse lì ad aspettarmi nell'arco degli
anni e delle stagioni, dove vivere a contatto con la natura, dove stare con gli
amici, e che gli amici potessero sentire anche un pò loro perché risultato di
uno sforzo e di un'immagine condivisa. </p><p>Un
posto aperto, da frequentare spesso, da curare insieme, in cui accogliere chi

<li>Le cose più urgenti sono l'allaccio all'acqua potabile, una recinzione di rete
solida che tenga lontano i cinghiali selvatici che scendono di notte dalla
montagna (eh si! è parco naturale protetto..), una balaustra di legno sul
davanti a cui appoggiarsi a guardare il mare senza volare di sotto, il
ripristino dei muretti a secco e della base di pietra su cui posa il casotto,
l'installazione di un piccolo impianto ad energia solare (nell'adorabile
versione di kit per baite e case isolate!), l'acquisto di un wc portatile per
gli ospiti più agées o per quando è proprio impossibile raggiungere il bosco,
l'acquisto degli strumenti base per il mantenimento delle piante e del giardino
(decespugliatore, rastrello a denti fitti, forcone, seghetto... <span><br/></span>e una bella camicia a
scacchi, ovviamente!).<span><br/></span><br/>
</li>
<li>Subito a seguire, nell'assoluto rispetto delle regole del Parco, la
riconversione del casotto in lamiera in un piccolo cabanon (o una spaziosa
cabina di barca a vela, se preferite): coibentazione interna con pannelli
isolanti per mantenere stabile la temperatura, rivestimento e pavimentazione in
legno naturale, rifacimento degli infissi delle due finestrelle e relative
zanzariere, antiruggine e riverniciatura del tetto e delle pareti in metallo,
realizzazione di un piccolo cucinotto da campo in esterno.<span><br/></span><br/>
</li>
<li>E poi ancora... un tavolo con panche per grandi pranzi comunitari en plein air e cene
sotto la stellata, doccia da giardino, sedie a sdraio, una grande piattaforma
di legno per stendersi al sole, piante rampicanti da far crescere ai lati così
il giardino è più raccolto, qualche albero per potersi sdraiare all'ombra e di
cui mangiare i frutti quando è stagione, piante fiorite perché profumano e sono
belle da guardare...<span><br/><span><br/></span>N.B.

<p>My name
is Alice Guareschi, I live in Milan, I studied philosophy and I’m what’s called
a 'visual artist': I work with different materials and techniques, articulating
my research over the years through video, texts, and the production of objects.  
</p>
<p>Here’s
a selection of what I’ve done so far: <a href=""http://www.aliceguareschi.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.aliceguareschi.it</a></p>
<p>I love
big cities for their energy, because
they allow me to move between different worlds, and for the fact that I can do
and see the things that move me and enhance my work: cinema, theater, shows, concerts.
</p>
<p>And
then there's my love for Liguria. The Levante coast and Cinque Terre in
particular. It’s a peculiarly strong bond, instinctive, with deep roots that
have to do with colors, shapes, smells, the light of that landscape which is
both inaccessible and incredibly beautiful.<span><br/><br/></span></p><h4><b> A GARDEN AT TRAMONTI</b></h4><p></p>
<p>It’s
been years that I’ve been looking for a place like this: a piece of land in
front of the horizon line to come back to, whether it’s there waiting for me with
the passage of years and seasons, a place to live at one with nature, a place
to be with friends, a place friends can feel is a little bit theirs as well
because it’s the result of a collective effort and a shared image.</p>
<p>An open
place, to visit frequently, to take care of together, somewhere to greet people
passionate about this project, a place where you can make things happen, a
hangout.</p>
<p>A garden to host an
international artist summer camp and micro festival for independent production
with days open to the public.</p>
<p>I finally found it last summer: it’s a little
garden of about 230 mq (2500 sf) on a peak overlooking the sea, near Fossola di Tramonti,
where the Cinque Terre National Park starts.</p>

<p>1.  The
most urgent tasks are: connecting the land to drinkable water, a solid gate for
protection against wild boars that come down from the mountain at night (yes!
this is a protected wildlife area…), a handrail one can lean on to take in the
wonderful view without flying down towards the sea, re-construction of the dry
stone wall and the rock base on which the cabin stands, installation of a small
solar energy system (in the adorable version for mountain huts and isolated
houses!), purchase of a porta potty for the older guests or for those times
when it’s impossible to get to the woods, purchase of instruments to upkeep the
plants in the garden (weed killer, fine comb rake, pitchfork, hacksaw…and
obviously a checkered shirt!). </p>
<p>2. 
Immediately afterwards, in full respect of the Park rules, the re-conversion of
the metal sheet hut into a little cabanon (or a spacious cabin of a sail boat,
if you prefer): internal insulation with insulating panels to maintain the
temperature inside, floors in natural wood, re-construction of the two window
frames and mosquito screens, anti-rust covering and a paint job for the roof
and metal walls, construction of a small outside kitchen.  </p>
<p>3.  And
then…a table and benches for the big lunches all together en plein air and
dinners under the stars, outside shower, chaise longues, a large wooden
platform for laying out in the sun, climbing plants to plant at the edges of
the garden so it feels cosy, a few trees to create some shade as well as to
have some fruit when the season comes, flowering plants because they’re
beautiful and smell good…</p>

has to be carried by foot on your shoulder for the three flights of stairs
which separate the land from the parking area…welcome to Liguria!<span><br/></span><b><span><br/></span></b></p><h4><b> WHAT YOUR MONEY WILL GO TOWARDS</b></h4><p></p>

chiamo Alice Guareschi, vivo a Milano, ho studiato filosofia e sono quello che
viene definito oggi un 'artista visivo': lavoro con materiali e tecniche differenti, articolando la mia ricerca nel tempo tra opere video, testi, e la
produzione di oggetti.  Una selezione di quello che ho fatto finora è visibile qui:
www.aliceguareschi.itAmo le
grandi città per la loro energia, perché mi permettono di muovermi tra ambienti anche molto diversi tra loro, e
perché offrono la possibilità di fare e vedere le cose che da sempre mi
appassionano e nutrono il mio lavoro: cinema, teatro, mostre e concerti. E poi
amo la Liguria. La costa di Levante e le Cinque Terre in particolare. E' un
legame molto forte, istintivo, che ha radici profonde e ha a che fare con i
colori, le forme, gli odori, la luce di questo paesaggio insieme impervio e
bellissimo.UN GIARDINO A TRAMONTI
Da anni
cercavo un posto come questo: un pezzo di terra davanti alla linea
dell'orizzonte dove poter tornare, che fosse lì ad aspettarmi nell'arco degli
anni e delle stagioni, dove vivere a contatto con la natura, dove stare con gli
amici, e che gli amici potessero sentire anche un pò loro perché risultato di
uno sforzo e di un'immagine condivisa. Un
posto aperto, da frequentare spesso, da curare insieme, in cui accogliere chi
si appassiona al progetto, in cui fare accadere cose, in cui ritrovarsi. Un posto in cui ospitare un summer camp per artisti internazionali e organizzare un micro
festival estivo di produzioni indipendenti aperto a tutti.Finalmente
l'estate scorsa l'ho trovato: è un piccolo giardino di 230 mq a picco sul mare a Fossola di Tramonti, dove comincia il Parco Nazionale delle Cinque
Terre.L'Acquisto della terra è stato solo l'inizio: ora si tratta di pensare, disegnare, costruire
tutto!COSA C'E' DA FARE

Le cose più urgenti sono l'allaccio all'acqua potabile, una recinzione di rete
solida che tenga lontano i cinghiali selvatici che scendono di notte dalla
montagna (eh si! è parco naturale protetto..), una balaustra di legno sul
davanti a cui appoggiarsi a guardare il mare senza volare di sotto, il
ripristino dei muretti a secco e della base di pietra su cui posa il casotto,
l'installazione di un piccolo impianto ad energia solare (nell'adorabile
versione di kit per baite e case isolate!), l'acquisto di un wc portatile per
gli ospiti più agées o per quando è proprio impossibile raggiungere il bosco,
l'acquisto degli strumenti base per il mantenimento delle piante e del giardino
(decespugliatore, rastrello a denti fitti, forcone, seghetto... e una bella camicia a
scacchi, ovviamente!).

Subito a seguire, nell'assoluto rispetto delle regole del Parco, la
riconversione del casotto in lamiera in un piccolo cabanon (o una spaziosa
cabina di barca a vela, se preferite): coibentazione interna con pannelli
isolanti per mantenere stabile la temperatura, rivestimento e pavimentazione in
legno naturale, rifacimento degli infissi delle due finestrelle e relative
zanzariere, antiruggine e riverniciatura del tetto e delle pareti in metallo,
realizzazione di un piccolo cucinotto da campo in esterno.

--ABOUT ME
My name
is Alice Guareschi, I live in Milan, I studied philosophy and I’m what’s called
a 'visual artist': I work with different materials and techniques, articulating
my research over the years through video, texts, and the production of objects.  

Here’s
a selection of what I’ve done so far: www.aliceguareschi.it
I love
big cities for their energy, because
they allow me to move between different worlds, and for the fact that I can do
and see the things that move me and enhance my work: cinema, theater, shows, concerts.

And
then there's my love for Liguria. The Levante coast and Cinque Terre in
particular. It’s a peculiarly strong bond, instinctive, with deep roots that
have to do with colors, shapes, smells, the light of that landscape which is
both inaccessible and incredibly beautiful. A GARDEN AT TRAMONTI
It’s
been years that I’ve been looking for a place like this: a piece of land in
front of the horizon line to come back to, whether it’s there waiting for me with
the passage of years and seasons, a place to live at one with nature, a place
to be with friends, a place friends can feel is a little bit theirs as well
because it’s the result of a collective effort and a shared image.
An open
place, to visit frequently, to take care of together, somewhere to greet people
passionate about this project, a place where you can make things happen, a
hangout.
A garden to host an
international artist summer camp and micro festival for independent production
with days open to the public.
I finally found it last summer: it’s a little
garden of about 230 mq (2500 sf) on a peak overlooking the sea, near Fossola di Tramonti,

<br/><p>In the past year, it has been my extreme blessing to paint murals for the Oncology unit at St. Joseph Regional Medical Center, in Mishawaka, Indiana.  When I first  began to paint here, I didn't realize how much this job would impact my life.  As I have watched cancer patients view my artwork, I have seen them gain hope, and determination to keep up the fight.  This experience has inspired me.  It has given me focus, and a vision for my future as an artist.  My desire is to continue to bring hope to Oncology patients through expressive art.  <br/></p>
<p>My ambition is to continue painting inspirational murals for cancer patience throughout the U.S. in 2015.  Last August, in an effort to accomplish my goal, I purchased a 1973  Airstream Sovereign.  However, it was hit by a tornado and needs some work before it is road ready.</p>

</div><p></p><p></p><p><b>Washing D'Arty Linen</b></p><p>In Veli, in the southern Indian port city of Kochi there is a common facility for washer-men called DHOBI KHANA. This is managed by the washer men's co-operative called the Vannar Sangham. All together 60 washer- men wash 1000 pieces of clothing and bed linen in a day. Since Kochi is a popular tourist destination, most of the dirty laundry consists of linen collected from the local home stays and hotels.</p><p>The mammoth task of soaking, washing, and rinsing is carried out manually and is an extremely laborious process. The washer-men start working every day at 5.00A.M and usually work till 5 pm in the evening. The washing is done in a traditional manner in a barrack housing 42 cubicles of roughly 8 feet by 10 feet each. The cubicle is divided into two cement water tanks –one about 3 feet tall along the back wall and the second filled with about one and a half feet water in which they stand and do the washing. While being a labor intense process, the current setup is also causing a lot of health issues for the washer-men. The Vannar Sangham is looking to mechanise the facility in order to provide working conditions for the washer-men, but the lack of funds is limiting them from keep pace with the changing times.</p><p></p><p>Kochi is a tourist town, dotted with home
stays. There is therefore no dearth of work for the Dhobi Khana but the
younger generation considers this a menial occupation and is seeking employment
in other professions. Some have even moved to other towns. </p><p></p><p>The community has self –organised into a
co-operative which  is an important factor as it has created an effective

Most of my projects aim to provide discursive platforms for addressing contemporary urban issues.  I am the co-founder of the Bombay-based artist collective called “Open Circle” that sought to engage with contemporary socio-political issues by I integrating theory with practice. As a core member of the “Open Circle” initiative, I organized study circles, public </p><p>actions, protests, and other interventionist actions in which I developed various strategies of art making to generate awareness about important social and cultural issues.

Having  worked with various organisations and unions on issues regarding inequitable development and displacement of urban poor in Bombay,  I have also  convened and curated numerous international events, screenings, and exhibitions, and had the opportunity to serve as the co-convener and facilitator of the Culture Committee in the World Social Forum (2004), Mumbai, India.  I have a Masters in Sculpture from M.

This is managed by the washer men's co-operative called the Vannar Sangham. All together 60 washer- men wash 1000 pieces of clothing and bed linen in a day. Since Kochi is a popular tourist destination, most of the dirty laundry consists of linen collected from the local home stays and hotels.The mammoth task of soaking, washing, and rinsing is carried out manually and is an extremely laborious process. The washer-men start working every day at 5.00A.M and usually work till 5 pm in the evening. The washing is done in a traditional manner in a barrack housing 42 cubicles of roughly 8 feet by 10 feet each. The cubicle is divided into two cement water tanks –one about 3 feet tall along the back wall and the second filled with about one and a half feet water in which they stand and do the washing. While being a labor intense process, the current setup is also causing a lot of health issues for the washer-men. The Vannar Sangham is looking to mechanise the facility in order to provide working conditions for the washer-men, but the lack of funds is limiting them from keep pace with the changing times.Kochi is a tourist town, dotted with home
stays. There is therefore no dearth of work for the Dhobi Khana but the
younger generation considers this a menial occupation and is seeking employment
in other professions. Some have even moved to other towns. The community has self –organised into a
co-operative which  is an important factor as it has created an effective
eco-system. I believe it is important for the co-operative to sustain
itself and continue functioning. If the co-operative breaks up, without
doubt smaller laundries will spring up to supply the demand leading to
competitive practices for individual profit. The current members of the
co-operative who are mainly of advanced years are aware of the benefits of
working as a collective. Apart from sharing an emotional bond that goes
back centuries, they also benefit from the collective bank account -the

<h3>The Book</h3>
<p><br/><i>We collect together in a net</i> is an artist's book by Kerry Downey, which will be published this June by Wendy's Subway, a Brooklyn-based non-profit reading room, writing space, and independent publisher. Designed by Erik Freer and edited by Rachel Valinsky, the publication will include 14 full color reproductions of recent work, alongside texts by a handful of incredible art writers: Jaime Shearn Coan, Jeanne Vaccaro, Ryan Wong, and Layla Zami.<br/><br/><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>We collect together in a net </i>assembles a series of monotypes that have been transformed through highly physical printed and manual processes (Chine-collé, embossment, rubbing, sanding). These many forms of contact bring attention to the materiality of paper, and draw parallels between paper’s surface and our skin. Skin’s porousness acts as a threshold, between the personal and the social, the psychological and the embodied. Like a net, it contains and disperses, and locates our entanglements in the world. The net is a central figure in Downey’s interdisciplinary practice, and reflects on the interdependent structures that produce the many ways we inhabit our bodies and access forms of power.</span><br/><br/>This series of works on paper was produced at Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop, a co-operative printmaking workspace. In close collaboration with each writer, the book’s designer, and the editorial team, they are collected in this new artist’s book. Like much of Kerry’s work, the publication offered an opportunity to explore how collaboration across these different modes is possible, and to create occasions for relationships and conversations to grow out of the work itself.<br/><br/><u>Book Details</u><br/><br/><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Kerry Downey</span><br/><i>We collect together in a net</i><br/>Softcover, Sewn binding<br/>9.5 x 13 inches, 44 pages<br/>14 color plates<br/>Edition of 500 (50 signed)<br/>ISBN: 978-1-7327086-2-4<br/>Release: July 2019<br/>Retail cost: $30</p>

<b>About Kerry Downey</b><br/> </h3>
<p><a href=""http://kerrydowney.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kerry Downey</a> (b.1979, Ft. Lauderdale) is an interdisciplinary artist and educator based in New York City. Downey’s work explores relationality through the multitude of ways we inhabit our bodies and access forms of power.

We collect together in a net is an artist's book by Kerry Downey, which will be published this June by Wendy's Subway, a Brooklyn-based non-profit reading room, writing space, and independent publisher. Designed by Erik Freer and edited by Rachel Valinsky, the publication will include 14 full color reproductions of recent work, alongside texts by a handful of incredible art writers: Jaime Shearn Coan, Jeanne Vaccaro, Ryan Wong, and Layla Zami.We collect together in a net assembles a series of monotypes that have been transformed through highly physical printed and manual processes (Chine-collé, embossment, rubbing, sanding). These many forms of contact bring attention to the materiality of paper, and draw parallels between paper’s surface and our skin. Skin’s porousness acts as a threshold, between the personal and the social, the psychological and the embodied. Like a net, it contains and disperses, and locates our entanglements in the world. The net is a central figure in Downey’s interdisciplinary practice, and reflects on the interdependent structures that produce the many ways we inhabit our bodies and access forms of power.This series of works on paper was produced at Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop, a co-operative printmaking workspace. In close collaboration with each writer, the book’s designer, and the editorial team, they are collected in this new artist’s book. Like much of Kerry’s work, the publication offered an opportunity to explore how collaboration across these different modes is possible, and to create occasions for relationships and conversations to grow out of the work itself.Book DetailsKerry DowneyWe collect together in a netSoftcover, Sewn binding9.5 x 13 inches, 44 pages14 color platesEdition of 500 (50 signed)ISBN: 978-1-7327086-2-4Release: July 2019Retail cost: $30

'This is a conversation that is long overdue' Vicky Featherstone
In 2015 an independent survey of over 500 parents in the creative industries conducted by Laura Wells, found that 74% of respondents had missed out on work due to childcare issues. Due to the lack of provision for the self-employed creative there is
often little choice over which job to take or when to work if practitioners are
to make ends meet and provide for their families. Most face significant
difficulties accessing affordable, flexible childcare. Many parents in the
performing arts industry – particularly female and single parents – are dropping out
of the workforce as they cannot afford to continue their profession.
Childcare, support and understanding should not be a privilege, they
should be a given, in our industry as in others. It is not acceptable that
childbirth should be the beginning of one life and the end of another.
This is not an issue limited to gender, class, race or even whether you

<p><strong><i>""The mountain as metaphor looms large in the lives of marginalized people, people whose bones get crushed in the grind of capitalism, patriarchy, white supremacy.

<h3><b>What is 'Claimed Pastures'?</b></h3>
<p>Claimed Pastures Is a photographic series i've been preparing for, which seeks to document and explore the complex and diverse queer identities that exist within rural areas. Claimed pastures sets out to tell stories of LGBTQ people underrepresented in mainstream culture and arts, broaden our understanding of where Queer people exist &amp; flourish, and explore how our cultural &amp; natural worlds affect our identity work/expressions of Queerness. </p>
<p>This project stems from a desire to look at the ways in which LGBTQ culture and identity play out in different areas and what barriers exist that prevent some folks from entering/living in the urban areas that we know as Queer hubs.</p>
<p><strong>This project is not restricted to any population size (or lack there of). Rather, it defines rural as any space that holds stigma as being uncultured, uneducated, or unrecognized. It will focus on areas that may lack visibility, resources, or recognition as a space for Queer people to inhabit. And it will highlight how these spaces uniquely affect people's identity work, how they express their queerness, and how they interact with, deviant from, or rely on their communities. </strong></p>
<p>And in a time of great political turmoil &amp; uncertainty, and in a time where many cities are becoming unaffordable for many folks, we will seek to highlight spaces and organizations that exist as Queer hubs/resource centers outside of urban areas. </p>
<p>This project will also seek to take an intersectional approach &amp; will reach out to a large range of individuals who may also face challenges based on race, class, ability, etc. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477782051/vzpfkci6nfcjnhmlglmz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>On the Road</strong></h3>
<p>I am heading out on the road in June 2017, for 1-2 months, traveling through the Northwest and beyond. During this time I will be exploring new communities and their environments, meeting numerous individuals to interview &amp; photograph, and documenting my journey. I will be traveling in my trusty old truck packed with blankets, poetry, and photo equipment. I'll be staying with friends (or friends of friends) whenever possible, and spending nights in the back of the truck when need be. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476900887/ew4nac5rhamvgvmxxvxv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Challenges Ahead</strong></h3>
<p>As with any photo project, there will be challenges along the way. </p>
<p><strong>Meeting People to Photograph</strong>: Meeting LGBTQ folks in rural areas — at first glance — seems like an almost impossible task. But in the months prior to this trip, I will be connecting with as many people as possible to get in touch with friends of friends, family members, etc, to create as many leads as I can. There is a large issue of trust and vulnerability involved here, and not everyone I meet will want to be photographed or even be a part of this project.  and although not everyone I meet will want to be photographed, I will still plan on meeting everyone I can to at least hear their story. </p>
<p><strong>Film Logistics &amp; Production</strong>: Shipping. Printing. Scanning. Etc. While I'm on the road, I will be working with a photo-lab in Idaho that I have a long-standing relationship with. Thanks to your donations, I will be able to safely ship the film to them to avoid any potentially destructive happening to them. Once there, they will handle the initial processing, scanning, and archiving of the film - allowing me not only to collect stable, developed film at the end of the trip, but also view scanned copies of my work while on the road.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477376100/sgxg5owsfmxx8tqwycql.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>With Your Support</strong></h3>
<p>If I have the pleasure of receiving your support, I'll be able to buy myself a new camera and buy the necessary film. I will also be able to pay for the processing &amp; shipping of the film as I go on this journey. Finally, you will be helping me cover day to day expenses such as gas, food, and the ability to take a break from my day job for a few weeks in order to complete this project. </p>
<p>Every donation, large or small, is deeply appreciated and important for keeping us on the road, making art, and sharing people's stories. Even just $10 will allow us to put a few more gallons of gas in the car, take us a few more miles down the road, and a little closer to our goal of raising awareness about underrepresented communities.</p>
<p><strong>Cost Estimates:</strong></p>
<p>New Camera               $750</p>
<p>Film + Developing     $500</p>
<p>Travel Expenses        $1000</p>
<p>Publishing/Showing  $500</p>
<p>Extra Materials/Equipment    $250</p>

<h3><strong>Other Ways to Help</strong></h3>
<p>Just as important as making a donation is helping us to spread the word about our project. Please share on social media, send an email or text, tell a friend, whatever it takes, please help us to let people know about this project and make some noise.</p>
<p>You can follow the progress through <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/taytaytherat/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>, <a href=""http://tay-sanders.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tumblr</a>, or finding me on Facebook. </p>
<p>Also, don't forget to use Indiegogo's social media sharing tools after you make your donation, shout your support from the rooftops, we're proud to have you on-­board as a supporter, you should be too!<br/>____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<h3><i><strong>Disclaimer &amp; Last Thoughts</strong></i></h3>
<p>Although I consider myself a member of the queer &amp; trans community with rural routes — I am also white and fairly middle class. I recognize that many of the people and communities I may document are ones I am not a part of. I want to make sure to do this project in the most respectful and least problematic way possible, and give care &amp; solidarity to people who's intersectional identities make them vulnerable to discrimination, exploitation, and even physical danger.  This project is not about me, it is about the people in it. So please, if anyone has any insight or concern about this project, do not hesitate to contact me. I am always learning &amp; unlearning, and we are all in this together. </p>

We’ve hit our heads on glass ceilings, tried to climb the class ladder, lost fights against assimilation, scrambled toward the phantom called normality.""

What is 'Claimed Pastures'?
Claimed Pastures Is a photographic series i've been preparing for, which seeks to document and explore the complex and diverse queer identities that exist within rural areas. Claimed pastures sets out to tell stories of LGBTQ people underrepresented in mainstream culture and arts, broaden our understanding of where Queer people exist & flourish, and explore how our cultural & natural worlds affect our identity work/expressions of Queerness. 
This project stems from a desire to look at the ways in which LGBTQ culture and identity play out in different areas and what barriers exist that prevent some folks from entering/living in the urban areas that we know as Queer hubs.
This project is not restricted to any population size (or lack there of). Rather, it defines rural as any space that holds stigma as being uncultured, uneducated, or unrecognized. It will focus on areas that may lack visibility, resources, or recognition as a space for Queer people to inhabit. And it will highlight how these spaces uniquely affect people's identity work, how they express their queerness, and how they interact with, deviant from, or rely on their communities. 
And in a time of great political turmoil & uncertainty, and in a time where many cities are becoming unaffordable for many folks, we will seek to highlight spaces and organizations that exist as Queer hubs/resource centers outside of urban areas. 
This project will also seek to take an intersectional approach & will reach out to a large range of individuals who may also face challenges based on race, class, ability, etc. 

On the Road
I am heading out on the road in June 2017, for 1-2 months, traveling through the Northwest and beyond. During this time I will be exploring new communities and their environments, meeting numerous individuals to interview & photograph, and documenting my journey. I will be traveling in my trusty old truck packed with blankets, poetry, and photo equipment. I'll be staying with friends (or friends of friends) whenever possible, and spending nights in the back of the truck when need be. 

Challenges Ahead
As with any photo project, there will be challenges along the way. 
Meeting People to Photograph: Meeting LGBTQ folks in rural areas — at first glance — seems like an almost impossible task. But in the months prior to this trip, I will be connecting with as many people as possible to get in touch with friends of friends, family members, etc, to create as many leads as I can. There is a large issue of trust and vulnerability involved here, and not everyone I meet will want to be photographed or even be a part of this project.  and although not everyone I meet will want to be photographed, I will still plan on meeting everyone I can to at least hear their story. 
Film Logistics & Production: Shipping. Printing. Scanning. Etc. While I'm on the road, I will be working with a photo-lab in Idaho that I have a long-standing relationship with. Thanks to your donations, I will be able to safely ship the film to them to avoid any potentially destructive happening to them. Once there, they will handle the initial processing, scanning, and archiving of the film - allowing me not only to collect stable, developed film at the end of the trip, but also view scanned copies of my work while on the road.

With Your Support
If I have the pleasure of receiving your support, I'll be able to buy myself a new camera and buy the necessary film. I will also be able to pay for the processing & shipping of the film as I go on this journey. Finally, you will be helping me cover day to day expenses such as gas, food, and the ability to take a break from my day job for a few weeks in order to complete this project. 
Every donation, large or small, is deeply appreciated and important for keeping us on the road, making art, and sharing people's stories. Even just $10 will allow us to put a few more gallons of gas in the car, take us a few more miles down the road, and a little closer to our goal of raising awareness about underrepresented communities.
Cost Estimates:
New Camera               $750
Film + Developing     $500
Travel Expenses        $1000
Publishing/Showing  $500
Extra Materials/Equipment    $250
 

Other Ways to Help
Just as important as making a donation is helping us to spread the word about our project. Please share on social media, send an email or text, tell a friend, whatever it takes, please help us to let people know about this project and make some noise.
You can follow the progress through Instagram, Tumblr, or finding me on Facebook. 
Also, don't forget to use Indiegogo's social media sharing tools after you make your donation, shout your support from the rooftops, we're proud to have you on-­board as a supporter, you should be too!____________________________________________________________________________
Disclaimer & Last Thoughts
Although I consider myself a member of the queer & trans community with rural routes — I am also white and fairly middle class. I recognize that many of the people and communities I may document are ones I am not a part of. I want to make sure to do this project in the most respectful and least problematic way possible, and give care & solidarity to people who's intersectional identities make them vulnerable to discrimination, exploitation, and even physical danger.  This project is not about me, it is about the people in it. So please, if anyone has any insight or concern about this project, do not hesitate to contact me. I am always learning & unlearning, and we are all in this together.

Hi I'm Mark. I'm a father, a husband, a self proclaimed foodie and adventurer and an amateur photographer and painter. 
I want to inspire you through my original art to send us on The Great Italian Truffle Hunt!
People who know me know I love to try new things and get inspired by those moments. I will create some new art for you!
I picked up the artists paintbrush 2 years ago and haven't put it down since!
I was trying to surprise my wife for our anniversary and I painted a picture of our favorite spot. It was a memorable trip where we we enjoyed exploring the amalfi coast of Italy meeting interesting people, amazing sights and it's actually where I proposed to her at the edge of Mediterranean ocean with our feet in the water in Positano Italy. My painting inspired from that trip is shown above. It was my very first. Since then I have improved and painted from my little painting room in Nova Scotia Canada. I really get inspired from culinary adventures or experiences from traveling. When I was in Asia I explored such great foods, ingredients, I went on a cooking course, bought some canvases and some paint and brushes rented a moped, met some french dudes and spent a week painting and teaching then to paint all from our daily adventures. When Dee I are travelling we always uncover some of the most interesting people, stories, coffee's , foods, flavors and colorful experiences. We have always wanted to go Truffle hunting in Italy and I just know I will be inspired by this trip.    
Join me on my adventure and take home a piece of my art!
 


What We Need & What You Get
So in order to take on this inspirational culinary artistic expedition we are asking for some financial assistance  We will need money for travel, painting supplies, accommodations  etc. We will need to fly there, rent a car, head to the back roads, attend a truffle festival  get educated, meet the locals, learn about truffle hunting, befriend a hunter or farmer and a dog or two and start digging. The best adventures have a destination and the rest is a journey. Any assistance would be appreciated.
We figure it will cost approximately $5000 for ten days of truffle adventure.
And for your donation I am offering you some of my already inspired artwork! Please see some of the inspired works I have on display!

<p>Much like the recent photo series of 2012 ""Creatures"", this new series ""Machines"" will examine the human condition of mental evolution. The question ""Are we ancient hardware running advanced software?"" </p>
<p>Welcome to the post-human age. It is no longer the realm of speculative fantasy, or a curious vision into the future of mankind. The technologies that were once so unimaginable in science fiction are now delivered directly into the consumer's pocket. This new era has borne a global paradigm shift. We have become hooked on our machines. This series is a look into the submissive personality - one surrendered to machines. It is a glimpse at the presence, or lack thereof, that occupies the human mind. This project will examine the subconscious of a fully evolved, present-day human. Have we been numbed by machines? Are we the makers or the made? ""Machines"" explores the serenity and beauty of our collective vulnerability. The surreal and disquieting acceptance humans have so readily embraced. As a fashion photographer, I consider women my medium. The quiet gentleness of classical femininity mirrors many of the passive traits we've come to accept under the dominance of technology, and it's through the female body and its gestures that I express these concepts.  </p>
<p>The production of ""Machines"" will start this summer. Cushioned by weeks of pre and post production. ""Machines"" premier exhibition will take place this fall at ""The Royal"" in Brooklyn, New York.</p>

<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""2"">I am going on a trip to Europe jan25 to june23, 22 weeks. It will be a work, study, and play trip, involving permaculture, blacksmithing, and product concept and design.</font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""2""><br/></font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""2"">This indiegogo project is to help cover the costs of the last item, which involves observing, experiencing  photographing, cataloging, sketching, and developing designs based on my new experiences on this trip. I will need to cover not only the cost of printing the book, but the smaller backer incentives, but also part of the travel costs and the time it will take to organize this all! I also hope to develop some items and pieces based on this design research process!<br/><br/></font></p>
<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">The Long version...</font></h3>
<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">What's My Deal?</font></h3>
<p></p>
<div style=""font-size: 13px;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">I have a mission. I will be flying to London to start what will be a 22 week adventure of a lifetime across western europe, the British isles, and wherever else I end up (already have plans to fly to Kiev Ukraine!). As a creative type(artist and writer), this is a unique chance to obtain an expansive catalog of memories and experiences to be used as fodder for whatever I want to create. I will be exposed to an entirely new world of people, places, things, and ideas to bring back with me. New sights, sounds, and ideas to further my creative processes. I want to take photos, notes, and even samples of local culture, design, shape, and style to bring back and use in my own work. Even more so, I want to expand my experience and tap into even deeper reserves of ideas by triggering new thoughts and feelings. What a tall order!</font></div>
<div style=""font-size: 13px;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000""><br/></font></div>
<div style=""font-size: 13px;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">This is where I need your help. I've managed to save most of what I need to cover my trip, but have fallen a bit short. I'll be making ends meet one way or the other (short order cook in germany? Physical labor in Italy?), but I had an interesting idea. As an artist and writer, the potential for this trip to inform both areas of focus, I'd like to be able to spend a bit of extra time doing just that. So the less I am chasing sheep across Spain to earn money, the more time I can spend collecting inspiration!</font></div>
<div><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000""><br/></font></div>

<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000""><br/></font></p>
</div><div>
<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">The Impact</font></h3>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""2"">Ideally I will have a very rich and complex experience filled with epiphanies and revelations that will inform and enrich my life from here on out.</font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""2""><br/></font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""2"">As for the project. I feel that sometimes ""the artist"" is mystified into a complex system of creation that the ""non creatives"" don't get. First, there is no such thing as a ""non creative"" and second, it's not that mystical. We (creative folk) just express what we see, do, hear, and experience in whatever medium suits. In this case, I feel like harvesting ideas and concepts and inspiration, and formulating it into a book, allows for people to see not only my travel perspectives as an individual, but also as an artist. See how my brain gears work. What was I looking at when I visited the white cliffs, or the Paris streets. With the inspiration flow charts and photos, along with stories, journal entries, and personal thoughts, readers will be able to not only experience my trip second hand, which is an interesting thing unto itself, but also get an idea for what I am focusing on as I explore.<br/><br/></font></p>
<p></p>
<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">What's in the Book?</font></h3>
<div style=""border-color: initial !important; font-size: 13px;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">The general gist is this: I would like to compose a collection of short stories, sketches, design processes, photos, travel notes, and whatever else seems to fit from the trip. While much writing will occur during the trip, I would like to reserve the time for experiences and information gathering, and write the bulk of the work when I get home based on notes. </font></div>
<div style=""border-color: initial !important; font-size: 13px;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000""><br/></font></div>
<p></p>
<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">Since When are You a Writer?</font></h3>
<div style=""font-size: 13px;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">They say that decent writing is about relaying concepts to others that they don't already have, and that excellent writing conveys ideas and emotions in a way that captures your readers even if they already know what you're talking about. In past classes we talked about how a writer will write from his or her hometown perspective whether they want to or not, and as soon as we try to write a story about somewhere that we have no experience, it becomes obvious to yourself and the reader. If you're french, you will write best about french things. American's know America. it takes a really fantastic writer to capture the honest local vibe of a place they have never been, and they may still not be able to fool the locals.</font></div>
<div style=""font-size: 13px;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000""><br/></font></div>
<div style=""font-size: 13px;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">Well, from the academic side, I've studied linguistics a bit, a few foreign languages, taken writing classes both analytical and creative. I love words. I find written communication to be extremely powerful because you aren't fed so many other layers of communication. There is no body language, facial expressions, audible tone or volume. A person can take a week writing a few sentences or lay waste to a few pages in a matter of minutes. Because of this, what ends up on the page is interpreted more or less for what it presents to the reader. There is no room for error, the message must be tuned as accurately as possible to what you want to convey. </font></div>
<div style=""font-size: 13px;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000""><br/></font></div>
<div style=""font-size: 13px;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">From a creative perspective, this means that the more fodder you have in your brain to pick through when writing, the better.</font></div>

</div></div>","The Short Version
I am going on a trip to Europe jan25 to june23, 22 weeks. It will be a work, study, and play trip, involving permaculture, blacksmithing, and product concept and design.

This indiegogo project is to help cover the costs of the last item, which involves observing, experiencing  photographing, cataloging, sketching, and developing designs based on my new experiences on this trip. I will need to cover not only the cost of printing the book, but the smaller backer incentives, but also part of the travel costs and the time it will take to organize this all! I also hope to develop some items and pieces based on this design research process!
The Long version...
What's My Deal?

I have a mission. I will be flying to London to start what will be a 22 week adventure of a lifetime across western europe, the British isles, and wherever else I end up (already have plans to fly to Kiev Ukraine!). As a creative type(artist and writer), this is a unique chance to obtain an expansive catalog of memories and experiences to be used as fodder for whatever I want to create. I will be exposed to an entirely new world of people, places, things, and ideas to bring back with me. New sights, sounds, and ideas to further my creative processes. I want to take photos, notes, and even samples of local culture, design, shape, and style to bring back and use in my own work. Even more so, I want to expand my experience and tap into even deeper reserves of ideas by triggering new thoughts and feelings. What a tall order!

This is where I need your help. I've managed to save most of what I need to cover my trip, but have fallen a bit short. I'll be making ends meet one way or the other (short order cook in germany? Physical labor in Italy?), but I had an interesting idea. As an artist and writer, the potential for this trip to inform both areas of focus, I'd like to be able to spend a bit of extra time doing just that. So the less I am chasing sheep across Spain to earn money, the more time I can spend collecting inspiration!




The Impact
Ideally I will have a very rich and complex experience filled with epiphanies and revelations that will inform and enrich my life from here on out.

As for the project. I feel that sometimes ""the artist"" is mystified into a complex system of creation that the ""non creatives"" don't get. First, there is no such thing as a ""non creative"" and second, it's not that mystical. We (creative folk) just express what we see, do, hear, and experience in whatever medium suits. In this case, I feel like harvesting ideas and concepts and inspiration, and formulating it into a book, allows for people to see not only my travel perspectives as an individual, but also as an artist. See how my brain gears work. What was I looking at when I visited the white cliffs, or the Paris streets. With the inspiration flow charts and photos, along with stories, journal entries, and personal thoughts, readers will be able to not only experience my trip second hand, which is an interesting thing unto itself, but also get an idea for what I am focusing on as I explore.

What's in the Book?
The general gist is this: I would like to compose a collection of short stories, sketches, design processes, photos, travel notes, and whatever else seems to fit from the trip. While much writing will occur during the trip, I would like to reserve the time for experiences and information gathering, and write the bulk of the work when I get home based on notes. 


Since When are You a Writer?
They say that decent writing is about relaying concepts to others that they don't already have, and that excellent writing conveys ideas and emotions in a way that captures your readers even if they already know what you're talking about. In past classes we talked about how a writer will write from his or her hometown perspective whether they want to or not, and as soon as we try to write a story about somewhere that we have no experience, it becomes obvious to yourself and the reader. If you're french, you will write best about french things. American's know America. it takes a really fantastic writer to capture the honest local vibe of a place they have never been, and they may still not be able to fool the locals.

Well, from the academic side, I've studied linguistics a bit, a few foreign languages, taken writing classes both analytical and creative. I love words. I find written communication to be extremely powerful because you aren't fed so many other layers of communication. There is no body language, facial expressions, audible tone or volume. A person can take a week writing a few sentences or lay waste to a few pages in a matter of minutes. Because of this, what ends up on the page is interpreted more or less for what it presents to the reader. There is no room for error, the message must be tuned as accurately as possible to what you want to convey. 

From a creative perspective, this means that the more fodder you have in your brain to pick through when writing, the better.

Ok, So What About the Art Stuff?
Artists are the great communicators of our world (Even more historically so then writers!). We catalog ideas, emotions, and concepts present in our lives into tangible goods and items that can often survive many years, even centuries. How cool! We draw from our surroundings, lives, locations, upbringing, and genetic memory to create new(I hope) and interesting(I pray) pieces for others to enjoy. Again, as with writing, these things don't come cheap. You must draw on that which you have experienced to create new designs. The more you see, do, learn, and are, the more expansive and informed your artwork can be. Maybe it's something extremely simple like a basic shape or form. Maybe you spend months working on one piece with intricacies that only you know. The potential is nearly endless!

Money Talks...
The catch is, a trip like this is not cheap. I will be traveling for fun, but also for work. I have a few eco-design and permaculture stops planned, and even a few blacksmith/jeweler friends I am going to visit and help out for a few days to learn some new stuff.

Half of the money will go towards travel supplies and food while I am out there, as well as transportation. The other half will go towards the backer items!

Dude... that's a long time...
Don't I know it!
Once upon a time I did a wilderness immersion and survival training course through a company in Portland, OR. We spend 3-4 days a week, every week, for 8 months out in the woods.

It will be exhausting at times, and I am sure there will be tricky parts, but all in all I expect this to not only be an amazing opportunity to improve my creative works in both art and writing, but also to take myself to the next level. Take this challenge and evolve.

Where did you get this crazy idea?
I have been plotting this trip since I was in highschool! But if I gave you a quick list of everything I've been up to in he last 8 years you'd see why it took me so long to set it up!

<h3>About Paje</h3>
<p>     Paje is an artist, and generally a very thrifty one at that! She makes art in whatever medium she can afford, using what she can find. This has come to include, but is not limited to, sketching, painting, sculpting, sewing, songwriting, sewing, papercraft, calligraphy, bead mosaics, and jewelry making (under the tutaledge of her mother).</p>
<p>     Recently, though, Paje has switched jobs, and while she loves the one she is currently working, it has come to her attention that it is not enough to pay the bills! So she has decided that to make enough money on the side to keep herself afloat and keep doing what she loves, she must tap into what she does best- ART, and hope that it can make ends meet!</p>
<p>     That's where you come in dear friends! She needs a few things to get started, and the help is greatly appreciated, because without this help she cannot even begin!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Where your hard earned money is going!</h3>
<p>     Paje doesn't need too much, in fact, with five hundred dollars she thinks could probably start a small face painting business, or heck, even become a party clown who does balloon animals and juggling in addition to face painting, but every cent will find it's way into the grand face painting scheme.</p>
<p>     To begin she'll need paints. They will ideally be something like this <a href=""http://www.snazaroo.com/catalogue/catalogue.aspx?id=12578"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.snazaroo.com/catalogue/catalogue.aspx?id=12578</a></p>
<p>     Then probably brushes and sponges. Those will generally cost about 25 dollars all together.</p>
<p>      She'll need two chairs, one for herself and one for the person getting their face painted. She estimates those will be around forty dollars together.</p>
<p>     Next is a little table, in which to put said paint and brushes on. She would ideally have this one <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Table-Bag-W2716-Portable-Carrying/dp/B001V7B2OY/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380873454&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=travel+table"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Table-Bag-W2716-Portable-Carrying/dp/B001V7B2OY/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380873454&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=travel+table</a> as it looks easily portable!</p>
<p>     Next come a few small things, like a spray bottle, a water dish, and a little pail for tips. She doubts these will come to more then twenty dollars.</p>
<p>     And lastly among the essentials she'd like a little cart, like adorable grannies use to carry their groceries up hills. Paje has no car, so she will often be carting all of these beautiful things on a bus or BART with her, and will need some sort of support (she is with child and that's very exciting, but also limits how much she can carry) She has this one in mind, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/heavy-duty-folding-matching--Basket--Jumbo/dp/B002C7U6UI/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380873961&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=rolling+cart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/heavy-duty-folding-matching--Basket--Jumbo/dp/B002C7U6UI/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380873961&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=rolling+cart</a> !</p>
<p>     ""But wait,"" you may be saying, ""all of that only comes up to about 240!"" Yes, and she would still try and do this with fifty. So what happens if she makes it all the way to the grand five hundred dollars? Basically she'd like to add a few colors of paint to the starter set of colors. She'd like to be able to take pictures of her work, then print and laminate those pictures to make a sign, so people have an idea of what she can do when the walk up. She'd also like to add a few fun things to her repertoire, like the aforementioned balloon animals and juggling, but she has a little more than zero training in either of those. She may even sew up a funny costume to wear while she does these things, but mostly it's the extra colors. She'd like to be able to pull out any color she needed when the time called for it. OOH and maybe some glitter!</p>
<p>     But she isn't just asking for something for nothing, NO! She'd like to give you tokens of affection for helping her achieve her small colorful dreams! Things like cartoony doodles, old timey line sketches, personally written songs about a subject of your choice, possibly on ukulele, or tiny sculptures of like gnomes, or flamingos, or something. Maybe even a hat!</p>
<p>     You can help a Paje today!</p>

<p>     It takes a lot for a person like me to swallow my pride and tell people I need help, even for something that seems as small and trivial as this. This isn't small or trivial to me, it's huge, and I'm grateful that I've surrounded myself with the sorts of people that I can bring this to.

<h3>For many years, I've ""mucked about"" as an artist.</h3>
<p>I took countless art classes in High School and early on in college, but I never thought that art could be my passion. I was told so often, by people I respected and loved, that I needed to find a job that would pay my bills. I took their advice and I went to business school for a B.B.A with a minor in Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>During that process I went back and forth with myself on whether it was the right path for me. (Turns out, it was!) I continued to draw in my spare time, but I was focused on learning everything I could about having my own business.</p>
<p>When I was 21, I was back living with my parents after a really bad breakup. I was unemployed, freshly home from living out of state, with a healthy dose of humility gained from a failed attempt at moving across country. While sitting in the basement trying to figure out how to pay my student loans, I stumbled upon Etsy.com. That summer I jumped in full tilt making cutesy little things that I thought I could sell to housewives with young children. (Turns out, I couldn't.)</p>
<p>I found a job (finally) but I continued in the same young child vein for about a year and a half. I tried a lot of different handicrafts during that time, though. Nothing was sacred. I rediscovered myself as an artist; mod podge, scrapbooking, water color, quilting, perler beads...</p>
<p>Finally, one night I was sitting at my sketchbook when my best friend, Frances, called me. She had gotten her own work into an art show, and was seeing if I had put any work into it.  I figured, ""Hey! Nothing else has worked!"" and I submitted my illustrations into the show. I noticed that the group was offering merchandise tables for a small fee as well, and I thought, ""Why the hell not?!"" so I bought a table, too.</p>
<p>Oh... Did I mention that I didn't have ANY merchandise ready, exactly 0 paintings made to display in the show, no way to display anything on my table, and no understanding of how to get ready?</p>
<p>I had a month to get ready. 1 month. I took some time off of work and began planning fervently. I knew that in order to be a success to myself I would need to look professional and like I've done a show before. So, I took to the internet, pouring over guides, walkthroughs, photos, Vlogs, blogs, and everything else I could find. And I made it happen!</p>
<p>By the end of the show I looked to my fiancee, tears streaming down my face, and said, ""This is what I want to do for the rest of my life!"" I knew that I had finally found my passion, and now I want to share that passion with the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What is this?!</h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h476/cyanidelollipop/ScreenShot2012-12-25at20001AM_zps9bbd70e6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This campaign is to help me to get to Youmacon 2013, which is an anime convention in downtown Detroit, MI during late October. This is the biggest convention in Michigan and one of the biggest in the country. Artist Alley this year is about $150/table (plus however many helpers I'm going to need, which is only 1 person.)</p>
<p>This is going to be my first major convention, but I've done a couple of small ones in the past; mainly local art shows or putting paintings in galleries and such.  There is also a local anime/game convention coming up that I'm doing with a high school.  Pretty much every chance that's being put in front of me, I'm jumping on.</p>
<p>Youmacon would be a giant leap forward for me and my dreams of doing art shows and conventions forever; I'm sure my fiancee is going to be thrilled with that.  The idea of seeing happy people, dressed as eccentric characters coming by my booth and talking makes my heart jump every time I think it. </p>

For many years, I've ""mucked about"" as an artist.
I took countless art classes in High School and early on in college, but I never thought that art could be my passion. I was told so often, by people I respected and loved, that I needed to find a job that would pay my bills. I took their advice and I went to business school for a B.B.A with a minor in Entrepreneurship.
During that process I went back and forth with myself on whether it was the right path for me. (Turns out, it was!) I continued to draw in my spare time, but I was focused on learning everything I could about having my own business.
When I was 21, I was back living with my parents after a really bad breakup. I was unemployed, freshly home from living out of state, with a healthy dose of humility gained from a failed attempt at moving across country. While sitting in the basement trying to figure out how to pay my student loans, I stumbled upon Etsy.com. That summer I jumped in full tilt making cutesy little things that I thought I could sell to housewives with young children. (Turns out, I couldn't.)
I found a job (finally) but I continued in the same young child vein for about a year and a half. I tried a lot of different handicrafts during that time, though. Nothing was sacred. I rediscovered myself as an artist; mod podge, scrapbooking, water color, quilting, perler beads...
Finally, one night I was sitting at my sketchbook when my best friend, Frances, called me. She had gotten her own work into an art show, and was seeing if I had put any work into it.  I figured, ""Hey! Nothing else has worked!"" and I submitted my illustrations into the show. I noticed that the group was offering merchandise tables for a small fee as well, and I thought, ""Why the hell not?!"" so I bought a table, too.
Oh... Did I mention that I didn't have ANY merchandise ready, exactly 0 paintings made to display in the show, no way to display anything on my table, and no understanding of how to get ready?
I had a month to get ready. 1 month. I took some time off of work and began planning fervently. I knew that in order to be a success to myself I would need to look professional and like I've done a show before. So, I took to the internet, pouring over guides, walkthroughs, photos, Vlogs, blogs, and everything else I could find. And I made it happen!
By the end of the show I looked to my fiancee, tears streaming down my face, and said, ""This is what I want to do for the rest of my life!"" I knew that I had finally found my passion, and now I want to share that passion with the world.
 
What is this?!

This campaign is to help me to get to Youmacon 2013, which is an anime convention in downtown Detroit, MI during late October. This is the biggest convention in Michigan and one of the biggest in the country. Artist Alley this year is about $150/table (plus however many helpers I'm going to need, which is only 1 person.)
This is going to be my first major convention, but I've done a couple of small ones in the past; mainly local art shows or putting paintings in galleries and such.  There is also a local anime/game convention coming up that I'm doing with a high school.  Pretty much every chance that's being put in front of me, I'm jumping on.
Youmacon would be a giant leap forward for me and my dreams of doing art shows and conventions forever; I'm sure my fiancee is going to be thrilled with that.  The idea of seeing happy people, dressed as eccentric characters coming by my booth and talking makes my heart jump every time I think it. 
 
What is your hard-earned cash going to?

For the main goal I will need:

$300 for the booth and badges
$300 for the hotel for the weekend and gas to Detroit from Ann Arbor
$150 for the cost of prints and packaging
The rest is going to be eaten by fees from indiegogo and paypal. :(
 
If I am lucky enough to raise MORE than the asking $750 I will be getting these things:

Button maker
Getting calendars printed
A nice display rack
T-shirts printed
Marker refills to make more art with (my markers are refillable)
New business cards printed
A new color Laser printer
 
If I'm not able to meet the entire goal I will use the funds to try to get into a smaller convention. No matter what, I want to get into a show :)

<p>Mama Lava serves as an artistic intervention by introducing a new template of spiritual activism. As our society approaches environmental, social and spiritual choice points, how are we to continue as a human race on this lovely planet earth we inhabit together?</p>
<p>Mama Lava is in the format of a play and musical combined with the energy of a sacred ceremony.  Featuring transformational story-telling, sound healing, turntablism, movement, fashion design, performance and installation art, Mama Lava is a mechanism for spiritual healing, during a time of great evolutionary shift that has been prophesied for millennia. The piece will debut June 7th and 8<sup>th</sup> at Kraine Theater in NYC, and will take the audience on a journey.</p>
<p>Mama Lava will introduce dimensions of being while touching on societal wounding and injustices from earthly realms such as; the worldwide disappearance of bee populations, copywriting and manipulation of seeds by large corporations, abuse, cultural trauma, racial injustice, the oppression of women and more. These timely and sensitive topics will be put into perspective by teachings about our psychological, spiritual and energetic development, the evolution of our species, the introduction of divine templates of the masculine and feminine, and the power of prayer and intention. </p>
<p>The intention of the piece is to inspire others to be a part of a global shift towards unity and to foster healing. Through the intention and container of the performance, non-serving beliefs and energies will be released and transmuted, and a peaceful sustainable template for us, will be imbued into consciousness. Mama Lava will also spread awareness about personal transformation, breaking down the walls of what is taboo, while welcoming others to feel safe, accepted and at peace no matter what they have been through in life.</p>
<p>Mama Lava intends to create a new, harmonious sustainable paradigm for our world based on the infinite possibilities within us. Together we can be of service towards global awakening in this crucial time of change. This approach to ""healing"" is an integral part of a journey towards wholeness. This works on physical, energetic, spiritual, emotional, and mental level and will assist the audience in reaching a profound self-love and acceptance, from which anything is possible.</p>
<p>The performance ceremony is a creation of Lauren “DJ Chela” Harkrader, a DJ, songstress, activist, artist, and long-time healer in a variety of modalities including; Reiki, Brennan Healing Science, Sound Healing and is also a Reverend and doula. “Greek Chorus” members, Jazabel Jade, a celebrated burlesque performer and activist, and educator, choreographer and dancer Lorilee Chien join her.</p>
<p>We’re asking for your help to bring this project to life as your generous donations will help us secure the performance location and rehearsal spaces, and other logistics including set and costume design, promotional materials, travel and more. The perks for your contribution are in the form of sacred creations imbued with the healing intentions behind Mama Lava; the Mama Lava soundtrack, mandalas, jewelry, as well as healing sessions from Chela - either in person or long-distance.</p>
<p>Infinite thanks for your consideration in making this critical project possible. If you can’t contribute financially at this point, we hope you will see the performance June 7th and 8th. You can help us spread the word about Mama Lava via this page. Stay up to date on our creative process through our Facebook and twitter pages. </p>
<p>We can create a new, harmonious sustainable paradigm for our world based on the infinite possibilities within us. Thanks again for your support, may you feel as blessed and smiled upon as you indeed are! Aho. </p>

<p>Hi! My name is <a href=""http://emitter19.blogsport.de/christoph-limbach/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">kris,</a> I make music and sound projects. I studied applied physics and my passion has always been sound and it s social function.

<p>The <em>Sonic Landscape Interventions</em> is a sound project I will run at the <a href=""http://chalkhillresidency.com/artists/upcoming"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>Chalk Hill Residency</em></a> in California.</p>
<p><a href=""http://aporee.org/mfm/tracker.php?id=47"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>Sonic Landscape Interventions</em></strong></a> is an interactive and participatory sound scape project.

Walking through the landscape the <br/>listener listens back (via GPS - tagging of the sounds) to fieldrecordings / performances / voices that were recorded in place. The “sound <br/>walker” creates his on narration by choosing his/her way through the landscape. This soundscape can <br/>be experienced to every time, also years later. <br/>As a “<a href=""http://aporee.org/mfm/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">miniature for mobiles</a>” the final acoustical sculpture can be listened <br/>back on the web page of the <a href=""http://aporee.org/maps/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">aporee Project</a> and embedded on an extra project sound blog and the chalk hill residencies <a href=""http://chalkhillresidency.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">homepage</a>. <br/><br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will record sound (fieldrecordings, ambient recordings) from the surroundings of the area, and will make interviews with people and artists from that region. </p>
<p>It will be a participative project, where everyone can contribute something. There will be a series of in situ micro concerts in the countryside that will be recorded and put on the map. At the end I want to have a sound map on aporeemaps, which is something you can simplified imagine as google maps for sound, but it is more than that. and auditive map , with small histories of people, sounds from waterfalls and animals, barely anything that is audible and interesting.</p>
<p>I will design a <em><a href=""http://aporee.org/mfm/tracker.php?id=47"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Landscape Miniatures</a>.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>Later people can go for a walk with their smartphones in that area and enjoy the soundscape, like a radioplay you can literally walk through.</p>
<p>for that project i ll work together with the <a href=""http://aporee.org/maps/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">aporee maps</a> and the <a href=""http://chalkhillresidency.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chalk Hill Residency</a>, where i reside as an artist in residency.</p>
<p>I will make a strongly limited edition of individualized soundwalks. these can be purchased by donating more than 65$</p>
<p><br/>To make this happen, I need financial support in order to pay a part of the plane ticket, purchase materials, rent a car for doing interviews and finance my living during the period of working. I will work for six weeks fulltime on that project, during that time i wont have another source of income. I’ve decided to ask for your help to reach my goal of $1200 for the production of the Sonic Landscape Interventions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To complete my project, I need some backing in order to:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- finance a part of my flight from Berlin to San Francsisco. </p>
<p>- purchase 2-3 smartphones I will leave at the Ranch and that are available for all visitors to experience the sonic landscape</p>
<p>- rent a car for 2 weeks for doing interviews, collecting storys and sounds that are not reachable by bike</p>
<p>- make the cd s and boxes for the supporters of the project</p>
<p>- print flyers and posters to promote the project</p>
<p>- rent some video gear for a ""making of"" film of the project, that will also being posted here. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you’d like to support the project, there are several ways you can help, that I hope will correspond to people’s budgets:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- a ""supporters"" credit w/ your name and website (if wanted) </p>
<p>- the “sonic landscape” CD (with selfmade packaging)</p>
<p>- a unique box with a small found object and a personalized soundwalk made by myself on a cd especially made for you!</p>
<p>If I’m unable to reach my goal, the funds will still go towards the realisation of the project and you will still receive a cd or box! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I feel that with the <a href=""http://aporee.org/mfm/tracker.php?id=47"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sonic Landscape - Project</a> I will be able to contribute something to the world that is missing: a chance to hear how a place or region sounds, even when you are in another part of the world. </p>
<p>we experience our world by seeing, reading and watching and I want to enhance and enlarge this ""vision"" by adding sound to it.</p>
<p> Sound is a remarkable footprint of our ecosystem , that we should not miss to document and experience. It changes and is never the same. And theres a creative potential in exploring and transforming these sounds.  I want to do both of that. </p>

What
The Sonic Landscape Interventions is a sound project I will run at the Chalk Hill Residency in California.
Sonic Landscape Interventions is an interactive and participatory sound scape project. The final soundscape can be experienced on the Chalk Hill Residency and its surroundings via smartphone application with headphones. Walking through the landscape the listener listens back (via GPS - tagging of the sounds) to fieldrecordings / performances / voices that were recorded in place. The “sound walker” creates his on narration by choosing his/her way through the landscape. This soundscape can be experienced to every time, also years later. As a “miniature for mobiles” the final acoustical sculpture can be listened back on the web page of the aporee Project and embedded on an extra project sound blog and the chalk hill residencies homepage. 
 
I will record sound (fieldrecordings, ambient recordings) from the surroundings of the area, and will make interviews with people and artists from that region.

</h2><h2>Tattoos<br/>Tea Parties<br/>Absinthe Tastings<br/>Trundle Visits<br/>T-Shirts!<br/>Just some of the things you will get if you donate to our odd little cause!</h2><h1>Our Story</h1><p>High atop one of Swissvale's many mountains in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania sits the Trundle Manor art house, inhabited by one Mr Arm and Miss Velda Von Minx. As these artists have gained much notoriety for their collection of oddities and Victoriana, their self-proclaimed tourist trap has been featured in known magazines (Pittsburgh Magazine, Top 50 Things To Do In Pittsburgh, Lux Magazine), television programs (CBS News, IFC’s The Grid), and many online blogs and news websites (Boing Boing, Post-Gazette, Patch, Oh Honestly Erin, Odd Things I’ve Seen). There is trouble in paradise, though, as they have grown restless with their confines and must venture forth to spread their unusual wonder throughout Pennsylvania and the surrounding states.</p><p> </p><p>It is our pleasure to announce and warn the world of the Trundle Manor Traveling Creepshow. Soon, every man, woman, and child will be welcomed into a realm of bizarre antiquities and eccentric exhibits – a vision not even the strongest draught of absinthe could produce!</p><p> </p><p>The Creepshow is a long thought up and much thought out performance art piece being brought to life by the warped genius and artistry of Mr Arm, Velda, and the miscreants they call their friends. We will be constructing cabinets, designing showpieces and literally piecing together creatures for your twisted amusement. Unlike many modern sideshows and haunted attractions, the Trundle Manor Traveling Creepshow will be made of real creatures and unusual items plucked from the minds of the Trundle Manor crew. Tucked behind the flaps of a twelve-foot circus tent will be a world wrought with dark dreams and shining nightmares. With an old world charm of a gypsy / carnival styled surrounding, the Creepshow will present an atmosphere that has been lost to time, complete with actors providing an obscure experience stricken by none other.</p><p> </p><p>Beginning this August, the Creepshow will be setting up camp at various charity events, conventions, trade shows, flea markets, and festivals starting in greater Pennsylvania and across the east coast.</p><p> </p><p>The plan is to use Mr Arm’s 1952 Dodge “Creep Rod” truck to tow a gypsy styled mini trailer in classic caravan style to conventions, fairs, and flea markets.</p><p> </p><p>For a donation at the tent flap, curious folk will experience the wonder of Trundle Manor firsthand. Expect things preserved in jars, taxidermied oddities, eccentric mechanizations, and live entertainment from the freaks that proudly call themselves Trundles! Mr Arm has a glut of talented individuals that are excited to be a part of the traveling show and have grabbed on to the tasks of preparing the exhibits, designing personas to compliment the live environmental experience, and doing unusual promotion.</p><p> </p><h1>Our Impact</h1><p>In the short life of the “open to the public” Trundle Manor, we have seen the eyes of hundreds of people change and become childlike and filled with wonder simply by crossing our threshold. They have seen something that they could never dream would be in a normal neighborhood. We know that the traveling show will do the same, but for thousands more. It breaks our hearts to think that many more could be brought this inspiration if only we could afford to. If our Creepshow remains in the shadows of financially motivated obscurity, the timeless ideal of the traveling show that has been a part of the grand American imagination will be far the lesser. Without the push of the dime museum, the carnie sideshow, the “freak” tent, the standard way of life is set lax in its imagination and applied rabid to the throws of the personal video game and the little man in the box known as television. Our Creepshow will farther the imagination and broaden the tactile sense of what could be out there if you take the time to dream it up. Without individuals believing in the unusual and the back alley safe oddness of our type of show, we, at Trundle Manor, know that even the simplest of childhood dreams could be lost.</p><h1>What We Need and What You Get</h1><p>In order to fund our nefarious schemes, we need your help to raise the sum of $5,000 to get our Trundle Manor Traveling Creepshow on the road.</p><p> </p><p>Your donations will be used for many different pieces of this unusual artistic endeavor, such as:</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>The twelve-foot circular canvas tent that will house the exhibits has already been invested in with an exception to the costly steel support system that will allow it to be placed on any hard surface like a convention floor or parking lot. This tent will also be painted to display in a ballyhoo styled way, to showcase some of the more unique pieces and to draw in the crowd, which will require painting materials.</li>
<li>The work of creating the creatures for this piece will be done completely by the owners of Trundle Manor and their Igors but the materials must be acquired ahead of time such as taxidermy supplies and preservation solutions.</li>
<li>Each creature and oddity will have a specially designed case that reflects its personality that may consist of gold leafed bones, wooden and glass stands, mechanically activated movements, and etched brass plaques and accents. Along with these cases, electronic sound devices will be used to extend the experience to the auditory senses.</li>
<li>To house and haul the entire showpiece a gypsy wagon-styled trailer will have to be built. This design will also further the mystique of the traveling show, as Mr Arm believes that every little piece should contribute to the whole of the performance. Priced out, the cost of an enclosed trailer would be more than the design proposed by the Manor. This design includes a safe, store bought trailer base which will be built up with wooden sides and roof and will be painted to match the show. All of this will need to be purchased.</li>
<li>On top of this all, environmental pieces will need to be gathered such as rugs for the floor, drapery, mirrors for the walls, and lighting. The lighting will require a generator that has been priced at somewhat over $1000 to accommodate our needs for lighting, display electronics, speaker systems for mood music, and fog machine to emphasize the environment as part of our stage.</li>
</ul><p>The donation goal has been carefully designed to accommodate a fluctuation of prices for materials, and the Creepshow’s ability to slowly gather more environmental materials in our travels. While it would be our greatest wish to be able to assemble all of our needed materials in this one fell swoop and we ask for you, our benefactors, to give until you bleed, we understand that this world is harsh, and we may not reach our goal. If this is the case, our cause will not go to the wayside but would be the lesser and may not be possible for some time. Mr Arm has been doing his best to produce expendable income for this life-changing project, but this may cause the beloved tourist trap / art house, Trundle Manor to falter and a Pittsburgh attraction will be hard hit.</p><p> </p><h1>Some of Our Rewards</h1><p>By helping us, we have set up a vast array of gifts and experiences marked by donation amount that you will not be able to get anywhere in the world but here. Everything from limited edition buttons to private absinthe parties hosted at Trundle Manor for you and your friends. These are items that you may never forget. Each level gets Trundle Manor Villain buttons and tickets to the traveling show we are working towards.<br/>Additional donation levels get you some other cool Trundle memorabilia:</p><ul>
<li>From $25 up we’ll present you with a specially made and signed Certificate of Appreciation and your name will be etched on a plaque mounted to our Gypsy Wagon. Also past this mark, Phat Mandee is giving away a download of our favorite song, Ride the Rotor!</li>
<li>Limited edition Trundle Manor T-shirts in your size that will only be available to this campaign.</li>
<li>We offer cute touristy Manor postcards to send to your friends bragging about Pittsburgh’s coolest tourist trap.</li>
<li>You will be welcomed with door-donation-free admission to our aforementioned Trundle Manor for you and friends, and tickets to our Halloween party.</li>
<li>At the $250 level local tattoo legend, Cyco Mike, has offered to donate a tattoo to each individual with the stones to pony up the dough. His tattoos alone have gone for more than the donation price so snag these up.</li>
<li>At the higher levels Mr Arm is offering a Trundle Manor starter kit, a velvet lined box with what you need to open your own tourist trap.</li>
<li>Our parties that have been offered will be in your honor with friends you chose complete with absinthe tastings and tea cakes, all in there respective places of course. Phat Mandee has offered to sing at all parties from $500 to $1000, which equals a private showing of her amazing talents for your crew. Show your friends you are as cultured you think you are. After our campaign you can schedule your event whenever you like!</li>
</ul><p> </p><h1>Other Ways You Can Help</h1><p>We plead to you to help get our idea out there and to promote our unusual performance piece that we hope will add much wonder to our local humanity, and might allow people to know that there are other things out there in the world and that they can have a hand in these other things. We will have postings on our website, and we could use your help by writing about us on your blog, talking about us at your local coffee shops, share us on your facebook page, or simply whisper our name in your local back alley to every one eyed hobo with two dollars to his name who is willing to donate one of them to our cause.</p><p> </p><p>Head to <a href=""http://www.TrundleManor.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.TrundleManor.com</a> for more information on our company and its founders! If you are in the Pittsburgh area, feel free to call or text Mr Arm (412)-916-5544 to schedule a tour of Trundle Manor or to discuss donations.

<strong>What will Raising The Arts do for </strong><strong>Big Brothers Big Sisters?</strong>
</h4>
<p>Raising The Arts will help us introduce youth in our coverage area to a nationally renowned artist - a successful African American artist who makes his living with his art. Raising The Arts will allow students to have a hands-on art workshop with this nationally renowned artist. The youth we serve will be able to interact with Brown in a small intimate setting and let their imaginations and creativity take over. Raising The Arts also will allow Big Brothers Big Sisters to fund raise in a creative way and to try and recoup lost funding streams.</p>

Raising The Arts also will allow Big Brothers Big Sisters to fund raise in a creative way and to try and recoup lost funding streams.
About The Artist




Over the past two decades, nationally renowned artist Larry ""Poncho"" Brown has dedicated his career to creating more than 65 creations for various organizations all over the country. His powerful portfolio of images was commissioned by non-profit organizations for event promotions or fundraising. We are truly honored to have him create an image for Big Brothers Big Sisters. See some other images Poncho has created for other organizations: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.221443634620872.44691.131176456980924&type=1&l=f0d59db453

<h2><strong><br/><br/>SUPPORT GRAVURE’S EXPANSION</strong></h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.gravuremag.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gravure's</a> mission is to provide a sophisticated, independent venue to showcase vanguard fashion, art, design, and culture, but it is more than just a magazine.  It is a community and a venue for collaboration, nurturing and promoting creative projects which otherwise might not be see the light of day.</p>
<p>We are now seeking the support of our readers in order to secure capital to bring Gravure to a whole new level of reach and sustainability.</p>
<p>We started Gravure as a personal project with no desire or profit motive.  What started as a simple desire for a magazine offering contributors the creative freedom to do great work has since grown into a much larger venue and a vital community of creatives in fashion, art, and design.</p>
<p>Now we are seeking capital to expand and secure the future of Gravure as a venue for great and important work, and to expand our reach and better support and promote our community of contributors.</p>
<p>Publishing Gravure has afforded us the honor of collaborating with some of the most talented people in the industry.  The <a href=""http://www.style.com/stylefile/2008/12/a-gravure-matter/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">work we have created with them</a> has gone on to <a href=""http://www.artbook.com/9788862081191.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">become acclaimed art books by major publishers</a>, <a href=""http://models.com/work/gravure-magazine-diego-uchitel-and-gravure-special-exhibition"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">exhibitions</a> and has launched careers.  </p>
<p>The first six print editions of the magazine, as well as five <a href=""http://gravure-editions.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">limited edition artist monographs</a> have been produced <a href=""http://www.style.com/stylefile/2007/10/grave-matters/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">without advertising support</a> in order to ensure our creative integrity is maintained without having to answer to commercial interests.  </p>
<p>We are now extending our network to include new creative collaborations, establish new distribution partnerships, reach new readers, and acheive a higher level of sustainability, which is why we are asking for you to support and become part of the Gravure creative community.</p>

<p>  </p>
<p><strong>WHAT GRAVURE NEEDS AND WHY</strong></p>
<p>The main goal of our funding is to be able to do a significantly larger print run and expand distribution of Gravure.</p>
<p><em>Printing</em>:  This is our single largest expense.  Printing costs just to get an edition onto the press are staggering, but the costs per copy drop dramatically when you print larger quantity.  Our past printing costs have run between $9,000 to $15,000 per issue for limited editions of 1000 to 2000 pieces.  We print in the USA, because it affords us better quality since we can oversee the printing process by going on press and it also supports our economy domestically.  We’d like to at least triple our print run to reach more people.</p>
<p><em>Distribution</em>:  Most magazines make the bulk of their revenue through advertising, not through magazine sales.  Distributors take 45-55% of the cover price as their commission, which means higher per-issue costs make any profit impossible.  Increasing our print run would mean lower per-issue costs, which makes Gravure more economically sustainable so we can print future editions, keep creating work, and keep promoting our contributors.</p>
<p><em>Production Costs</em>:  As with virtually all independent magazines, ALL of our contributors offer their time, expertise, and passion for free, even going out of pocket to create the work.  They do this because, as much time, expense, and effort they put into creating the work, they know we put just as much work into making sure their work looks as good as it can, and making sure as many people see it as possible.  We’d like to be able to change the norm of independent publishing and offer budgets for our contributors to keep creating their work.  Any funds left over after printing and distribution would be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>  <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://content.gravuremag.com/temp/IGG_MAIN_B2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>As a token of our gratitude, we are offering various limited edition pieces and one-of-a-kind works of art by our contributors.  All supporters will be included in future Gravure offers, events, and promotions, and will become part of the Gravure creative community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT GRAVURE</strong></p>
<p>When you support Gravure, you are supporting an entire community of artists.  Every dollar given helps our contributors to create significant work which would otherwise not have a platform on which to be seen, and supports us in our efforts to showcase and offer exposure to various artists, both established and up-and-coming.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>Share on Facebook, Tweet, blog, email, and tell your friends and family about Gravure’s campaign!  Even if you are unable to offer money, any effort you can make to let people know is a massive help.</p>

SUPPORT GRAVURE’S EXPANSION
Gravure's mission is to provide a sophisticated, independent venue to showcase vanguard fashion, art, design, and culture, but it is more than just a magazine.  It is a community and a venue for collaboration, nurturing and promoting creative projects which otherwise might not be see the light of day.
We are now seeking the support of our readers in order to secure capital to bring Gravure to a whole new level of reach and sustainability.
We started Gravure as a personal project with no desire or profit motive.  What started as a simple desire for a magazine offering contributors the creative freedom to do great work has since grown into a much larger venue and a vital community of creatives in fashion, art, and design.
Now we are seeking capital to expand and secure the future of Gravure as a venue for great and important work, and to expand our reach and better support and promote our community of contributors.
Publishing Gravure has afforded us the honor of collaborating with some of the most talented people in the industry.  The work we have created with them has gone on to become acclaimed art books by major publishers, exhibitions and has launched careers.  
The first six print editions of the magazine, as well as five limited edition artist monographs have been produced without advertising support in order to ensure our creative integrity is maintained without having to answer to commercial interests.  
We are now extending our network to include new creative collaborations, establish new distribution partnerships, reach new readers, and acheive a higher level of sustainability, which is why we are asking for you to support and become part of the Gravure creative community.
 

  
WHAT GRAVURE NEEDS AND WHY
The main goal of our funding is to be able to do a significantly larger print run and expand distribution of Gravure.
Printing:  This is our single largest expense.  Printing costs just to get an edition onto the press are staggering, but the costs per copy drop dramatically when you print larger quantity.  Our past printing costs have run between $9,000 to $15,000 per issue for limited editions of 1000 to 2000 pieces.  We print in the USA, because it affords us better quality since we can oversee the printing process by going on press and it also supports our economy domestically.  We’d like to at least triple our print run to reach more people.
Distribution:  Most magazines make the bulk of their revenue through advertising, not through magazine sales.  Distributors take 45-55% of the cover price as their commission, which means higher per-issue costs make any profit impossible.  Increasing our print run would mean lower per-issue costs, which makes Gravure more economically sustainable so we can print future editions, keep creating work, and keep promoting our contributors.
Production Costs:  As with virtually all independent magazines, ALL of our contributors offer their time, expertise, and passion for free, even going out of pocket to create the work.  They do this because, as much time, expense, and effort they put into creating the work, they know we put just as much work into making sure their work looks as good as it can, and making sure as many people see it as possible.  We’d like to be able to change the norm of independent publishing and offer budgets for our contributors to keep creating their work.  Any funds left over after printing and distribution would be used for this purpose.
  
 
WHAT YOU GET
As a token of our gratitude, we are offering various limited edition pieces and one-of-a-kind works of art by our contributors.  All supporters will be included in future Gravure offers, events, and promotions, and will become part of the Gravure creative community.
 
WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT GRAVURE
When you support Gravure, you are supporting an entire community of artists.  Every dollar given helps our contributors to create significant work which would otherwise not have a platform on which to be seen, and supports us in our efforts to showcase and offer exposure to various artists, both established and up-and-coming.
 
ADDITIONAL WAYS YOU CAN HELP
Share on Facebook, Tweet, blog, email, and tell your friends and family about Gravure’s campaign!  Even if you are unable to offer money, any effort you can make to let people know is a massive help.

<p><em>Paradiso</em> is a live production by Stacy Scibelli and Rachel Fainter featuring aerial acrobatics, opera, dance, and more.  It will be an unconventional interpretation of the third book of <em>The</em> <em>Divine Comedy</em>, in which Dante recounts his ascension through Heaven.  <em>Paradiso</em> will be among the first artist-produced shows at The Slipper Room, a result of their up-and-coming artist-in-residence program.</p>
<p>The Slipper Room is best known for its edgy burlesque performances and variety shows.  The new artist-in-residence program is designed to broaden their concept as an experimental theater and to invite new perspectives into their weekly lineup.  At the same time, visual artists get a unique opportunity to produce a performance in a gorgeous LES theater.  We are raising funds for this production in hopes that the success of this show will generate interest in the Slipper Room's artist-in-residence program, and in turn will make it available to other visual artists in the future who wish to work in the medium of stage production. </p>
<p>Stacy Scibelli and Rachel Fainter are both New York-based visual artists.  Stacy works primarily in fabrics, designing wearable, interactive art that is both sculpturesque and rich with social commentary.  Rachel is largely a 2-D artist, producing dissonant paintings that explore themes of lust, shame, and memory, but more recently has begun producing live shows.  This will be the first opportunity for these two artists to collaborate on a production in a Manhattan theater, bringing together their respective areas of expertise to create this distinctive performance.</p>
<p><em>Paradiso</em> is perhaps the least familiar chapter of <em>The Divine Comedy</em>, following <em>The Inferno</em> and <em>Purgatory.  Paradiso</em> is the reward; the 'happy ending' to the unpleasant tale of the other two places. The medieval text is surprisingly abstract considering its Ptolemaic/geocentric views based on religion, alchemy, astrology, and witchcraft.  It is complex, divergent, and at times, psychedelic, with glittering and extraordinary imagery of spirits and celestial bodies.  This performance will stay loyal to that aspect of the text, transforming this piece of ancient literature into a brilliant spectacle of light and action.  </p>
<p>The money raised with this campaign will go toward custom-making costumes, designing stage sets, and compensating performers and stage crew.  We hope to raise enough to be able to run <em>Paradiso</em> for four nights beginning in October.<em>  </em>The success of this production will generate more buzz about and support for the artist-in-residence program.  And the more momentum this program gains, the more experimental shows patrons will have to look forward to, and a more established program for future artists to participate in.</p>
<p>Please donate to help raise money for this production as well as to get this unique and incredible program off the ground. It's a win-win for artists and patrons alike!  As a 'thank you' for your support, please check out our perks!

<h3></h3>
<p>Opportunities for self expression and
creativity are essential to a good quality of life. A group of artists I met in
Uganda recognized this and began sharing their skills and their paints and
brushes with kids in the neighborhood. It was informal at first. The kids would
show up at James Nsamba's tiny studio every morning, brimming with energy and
curiosity.  James and Farouk Mukwaya would hand out paper and paint and
colored pencils...then give the kids some basic lessons in how to use art
materials to express ideas and feelings..</p>
<p>Gradually we got more
organized. We call ourselves Uganda Art Consortium. We started a website, <a href=""http://ugandart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>ugandart.com</span></a>,
and we're part of Kisa Foundation USA, a 501 (c) (3) charity.</p>
<p>We now hold two or three workshops
every year, attended by hundreds of children where they learn painting, drawing
and jewelry making. We have 8 adult artists who volunteer as teachers. The kids
become energetic and excited as they see their visions take shape on paper and
canvas. They gradually become more confident, eager to speak out, proud of what
they can do</p>
<p>Daily life can be grim for children in
Namungona, a slum neighborhood on the outskirts of Kampala. Many are
orphans...without a stable home life, steady school or even a steady diet. Many
kids have to work to help support their families...hauling water, tending to
their Mom's vegetable stand, or weeding the garden. They miss school because of
work, or because the families can't afford the fees. School itself is pretty
strict and regimented. There's a lot of rote learning, little chance for ideas
or creativity.</p>
<p>The schools do the best they can with
limited resources, but there's scant music, art, or literature in the
curriculum. Our workshops help fill this cultural gap in children's lives.</p>
<p>Now we're hoping to build a small
permanent art center in the community where we can hold classes, store
materials, and have a gallery to display what the children have accomplished.
With a gallery, we can attract tourists. The kids can sell their artwork to
help support their families, and buy materials for the workshops. Having our
own place is an essential step for us to improve and expand our outreach to
Ugandan children through art.</p>
<p>The money we raise through Indiegogo will

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Opportunities for self expression and
creativity are essential to a good quality of life. A group of artists I met in
Uganda recognized this and began sharing their skills and their paints and
brushes with kids in the neighborhood. It was informal at first. The kids would
show up at James Nsamba's tiny studio every morning, brimming with energy and
curiosity.  James and Farouk Mukwaya would hand out paper and paint and
colored pencils...then give the kids some basic lessons in how to use art
materials to express ideas and feelings..
Gradually we got more
organized. We call ourselves Uganda Art Consortium. We started a website, ugandart.com,
and we're part of Kisa Foundation USA, a 501 (c) (3) charity.
We now hold two or three workshops
every year, attended by hundreds of children where they learn painting, drawing
and jewelry making. We have 8 adult artists who volunteer as teachers. The kids
become energetic and excited as they see their visions take shape on paper and
canvas. They gradually become more confident, eager to speak out, proud of what
they can do
Daily life can be grim for children in
Namungona, a slum neighborhood on the outskirts of Kampala. Many are
orphans...without a stable home life, steady school or even a steady diet. Many
kids have to work to help support their families...hauling water, tending to
their Mom's vegetable stand, or weeding the garden. They miss school because of
work, or because the families can't afford the fees. School itself is pretty
strict and regimented. There's a lot of rote learning, little chance for ideas
or creativity.
The schools do the best they can with
limited resources, but there's scant music, art, or literature in the
curriculum. Our workshops help fill this cultural gap in children's lives.
Now we're hoping to build a small

Living in different cities, they realized Denver had the potential for the creation of the artistic space and culture they valued. When they started in 2013, they didn’t anticipate the sudden hike in available warehouse space which has prevented them from obtaining a localized venue for Nothing To See Here. After looking at literally more than one hundred spaces, the decision to attempt a more nomadic approach for their exhibitions was adapted. A year and a half later, after several venue changes and exhibition tours, the push for a physical space has become more dire if NTSH wants to continue on. </p>Up until now NTSH has been entirely self-funded and although we wish we could continue following the same model, we have come to realize that the sustainability of our continued programming is unlikely without some additional support.

<p>Usually Caroline puts their Moon Of Retribvtion art into production first and sells second. This time around they figured they'd try Indiegogo as a way to help pay for everything up front. As a grad student, funding Moon Of Retribvtion is a labour of love in and of itself. </p>
<p>By contributing to the campaign, you get dibs on whichever pins you wanted, as well as extras from the Moon Of Retribvtion catalogue and extras that are exclusive to the campaign. </p>
<p>The pins are approximately 1"" in height (24 mm) and are soft black enamel with nickel-plated iron bases. The grey parts in the images provided will be nickel-plated silver colour. The pins come with rubber pinbacks, as well as information sheets. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share with your friends who are into witchy stuff, astrology, astronomy... whatever! Check out the stretch goals and share with anyone who you think would be into those, too :) Thanks!</p>
<h3>Which pin should I choose?</h3>
<p>The available pins are: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Venus, Pluto, Pallas, Juno, Vesta, and Chiron. You could choose celestial bodies that have a particular significance to you. Maybe your astrological sign is associated with a planet, and you want to carry it with you. Maybe you want to invoke a deity associated with a planet. Maybe you want to use it as a talisman for the magical intentions the symbol carries. Maybe you just really dig astronomy. There's tonnes of reasons to choose whichever pin you choose, and each one comes with a card describing its astrological and astronomical significance. Below is a version of the card description you'll receive for each symbol. </p>

<p><strong>ABOUT VIDEO</strong></p>
<p>I started working on this project at the beginning of October 2012. It is the further continuation of experimentation that started with my first video art project <a href=""https://vimeo.com/44402958"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“WIND/BREATH”</a>. The initial goal of this project is to connect fine art photography with video art. The shots will be composed statically and compositionally photographic. The final result will bring to mind, motion photography. An original song will also accompany the video.</p>
<p>In this video I want to reveal emotions that we most commonly hide in ourselves so others around us won't see. The theme I'm sure is close to you all as it is to me. Hidden and emberassing emotions that rarely become released can have destructive power over us. Only when we throw them out in the open, do we allow ourselves to heal and reach serenity. This video does not have a typical screenplay, everything will revolve around image and emotion. A storyboard will be attached in the gallery section.</p>
<p><strong>ACTION</strong></p>
<p>What interests me the most in this project is uncovering and showing the audience the deepest emotions hidden inside a man. The image will introduce a man with a stone cold-face standing near a table, hiding any sort of emotion. His only escape are his hands, which shows the audience the tension and pain concealed behind a thick layer of skin. On the table near the man, appear different objects that the actor interacts with. The climax of the video is the actor painting a picture (inspired by the abstract expressionistic images created by Jackson Pollock) releasing all his emotions on the canvas. This form of painting and creating is catharsis for him and is the only way he can calm himself.</p>
<p>The project is a pastiche to the work and creations of Jackson Pollock, Dan Flavin and also Laura Letinsky. I will also consult with one of Poland's greatest video artists, Józef Robakowski.</p>
<p>The esthetic layer is immensely important to this project. The intended image must be sharp, clear, sterile and clean. Added to the white background will be the element of bright pastel fluorescent lights. That's why the project will be filmed with the professional Red Epic camera inside a film studio.</p>
<p><strong>BUDGET AND EXPENSES</strong></p>
<p>The whole production will cost around 900$, but i’ll invest 200$ from my pocket. So to fill the budget I need 700$ more.</p>
<p>budget:</p>
<p>- Renting the Red Epic Camera</p>
<p>- Props and Scenography</p>
<p>- Pay for cast and crew</p>
<p><strong>CREW</strong></p>
<p>Crew consists of people from Poland and Canada. We are mainly students of Polish Film School, from diffrent specializations: Photography, Cinematography, Production. The set designer is a graduate from the Academy of Fine Arts in Łódż</p>

<p>I have never been motivated to put my work into the human river- although I have dipped my toe in a couple of times. Painting is something I’ve always just taken for granted. I had private lessons from the age of nine- after nagging my parents for two years- and was a kind of an apprentice to a mad Russian, Wassily Somer, for 14 years- from age 13. Money, career, and all that were not part of Wassily’s make-up. Wassily initiated me into an unbroken lineage - through his own teacher Oskar Kokoshka- emerging from prehistory in cave paintings and stone idols. Painting, from this perspective is a Spiritual endeavor. </p><p>I don’t do it for money. I do it for Love. </p>
<p> My life has been defined by ‘spiritual’ pursuits. As I enter my seventh decade, the responsibility to serve this Planet is before me. Perhaps such service is the role of Humanity?  Painting is the quintessential context for me to offer what small contribution I can. In fact, it’s all I have to give. I find therein harmonious active engagement of all three aspects of the Whole - focused in a ‘being gesture’ that presents an object rooted in the depths of the instant. This object is a painting. </p>
<p>Each and every one of us is a miracle walking around in a miracle- beautiful beyond description. My work, inadequate though it must inevitably be, dives into that miracle, holds it in paint and color, and is set adrift into the Human river to work as it will. </p>
<p>I feel strongly that this is work that needs to be done- that I must do as a matter of Conscience. I feel that it is of Real Value- both now and, perhaps more important, for the future- if we Human Beings have a future. I, for one, believe that we do. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/902930/files/20141003231153-leda1.jpg?1412403113"" src="""" style=""width: 494.1378413524057px; height: 669px;""/></p>                    (Leda- study for the triptych 'Solve et Coagula' <a href=""http://scheerartistry.yolasite.com/solve-et-coagula.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">project website</a>)<div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>See some of the perks here- <a href=""http://scheerartistry.yolasite.com/c-f-perks.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">examples</a></b></div><div>

<h3>                         What do I intend to do?</h3>
<div></div>
<p><b>Hallway of Mirrors, Anatomy of the Instant</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This project consists of ten major paintings arranged in a circular installation. Each painting will be facing into the circle, mutually emphasizing each other.  Yet they are discreet in themselves. ( <a href=""http://scheerartistry.yolasite.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">project website</a> ) Three paintings will serve as anchors  tying the installation into a whole. These paintings are interrelated from three perspectives- it is, it is what it is, and it is how it is. T<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">he instant is dissected into three fundamental aspects- time, the timelessness of pure </span>potency,<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and the 'unsayable impetus' or ‘will’ that states identity- in and as a single instance. Follow your eyes- what lights your attention lights the instant. This is the functioning of the installation as a whole- to light the instant.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Over the years I have experimented with a variety of techniques. Some of these are very intriguing. ( <a href=""http://40days.yolasite.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a selection</a> ) The seemingly unrelated will be seen in context as of the same source, the same hand, the same heart. Every single painting, every brush stroke, is dedicated to, and is in, Love. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Here is the lineage rooted in the dim mists of prehistory, the wonder that is the Human Reality. The Reality tasted in... lamplight flickering on the walls of a cave in France, the scent of the air in the Suleimaniyya Mosque, the echo of a medicine song chanted from a sacred peak, the profound silence in a Gothic cathedral- completely present with the immediacy of this instant, this now. Diving into this continuum in paint and color, references to Alchemy, Zen , Sufism , Taoism , and George Gurdjieff's challenge to ‘wake up’ and <i>see</i> come to bear. The project is unbound by any of this. Every instant is miraculous and whatever ‘stew’ savors of this miracle is of it. After all is said and done, there simply is. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This project is the contemplation of the instant in one instance. It will inevitably be colored by that instance- but, given that the instant is  miraculous, one miraculous instance cannot but resonate with every instance- for every instance is of the instant. The present moment is without hierarchy or division. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p> I thank you for considering  this effort. I ask, most humbly, for your financial investment toward the actualization of it. We will truly be co-creators as we step into the Synergistic Epoch, wherein beckons the promise of a future for Humanity- one that is dynamic and evolutionary- that is, in short,<i> </i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>responsible</i>. </span></p>

I will also set up an introductory display through which to enter the Project Space consisting of select paintings and drawings already on hand totaling forty additional works. This Project will be staged for three months, amidst ongoing promotional efforts via several appropriate avenues. All work will be available for sale. The Project, with your help, will also serve as a basis from which to seek commission work and to pursue sustained patronage- settting the stage for the next Project. In other words establishing the foundation for an ongoing <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">business. Thus, ‘Rat Factory’ encompassing production and sales/marketing, management etc. under a single fluid model free from physical location, enabling efforts on a Global scale. </span>

<div>
<div>
<br/><p>The funds I have available will allow me to work for four months. I’ve already invested four months of work. ( <a href=""http://scheerartistry.yolasite.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">project website</a> ) My best estimate is that I need four additional months- plus the four I already have covered- to finish these ten paintings by June. That leaves four months to finance. I have concluded that it will take at minimum $9250 to bring everything to completion and ready to stage. Add to that the percentage due for the campaign itself and the cost of time and materials- shipping etc- to fulfill the perks that figure can be rounded to $11,000 Once  financing is in place to ensure the time and materials to produce these paintings the energy currently being directed to fundraising can be redirected to securing a display venue. A marketing plan will commence as the work progresses. Several potential venues are lurking in the background but it wouldn’t make sense to pursue them until I know when I can deliver. </p>
<p>In addition to offering fifty pieces of Artwork for sale, people will be able to make contributions. Many people recognize the value in Art and wish to support the Arts but feel themselves excluded from doing so.  Crowdfunding allows people to play a real, direct role in the creation of something with the potential to open new possibilities into the World.  </p>
<p>One of the chief aims of the Project ‘Hallway of Mirrors’ is to establish momentum for what I am calling ‘The Rat Factory’ as an ongoing, self-sustainable business. This format, involving discreet yet interrelated projects staged for periods of three months each, can be duplicated anywhere, as well as opening opportunities as yet unknown. The vision motivating this modest beginning is Global in scope. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As I see it we are all eddies in a single river- the Human river, which in it's turn is an eddy in the Sea of Life unfettered. So I ask for your investment- moral and financial- in a synergistic effort to remember the miracle that is that river, flowing through each and every one of us. </span></p>
<p>Please, see the perks available and give your financial support to this effort. It's an investment in the future.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">                                             </span></p>

<p>I think of an investment in Artwork as just that- an investment. It is an investment with a slight twist that differentiates a painting from a stock portfolio. That twist is what makes Artwork only secondarily a financial transaction bearing merely the promise of monetary gain. The real investment is in the future of Humanity. </p>
<p>Art, as I see it, is an action. a Creative gesture, that has the potential to allow new possibilities to enter the World. These are possibilities inherent to the Human Reality and serve nothing less than the evolution of Consciousness on this Planet. A painting is a 'window into Eternity' and it is in this 'Eternal now' that all possibilities ache under the impetus of pure potential. We humans have the choice to follow the intimations of Beauty, a Beauty which, in it's Sheerness, permeates all 'times', all degrees of awareness. It is in the heart of Eternity that Sheer Beauty subsists- unchanging and immutable. It is this Beauty that is directly present in all instances of 'the beautiful' and is fluent throughout Being <em>per-se.</em></p>
<p>To me Painting is not only a source for my deepest sense of 'rightness' it is also a 'being obligation' and as such a conscious service in Being, to Being, by being- thus, there simply is. We people are in no way separate from Being and are, in fact is-ness, full stop. It is by the manner in which our lives are lived that Being Creates and Maintains Being in an infinite 'dance' of extension and gathering, a 'process' of 'eating and being eaten.' How and why? This is is a matter for wonder in the presence of irreducible Mystery. It is this capacity for wonder that gives rise to a painting and it is to this capacity for wonder that a painting speaks <em>directly-</em> being to being in Being. </p>
<p>The depth of the capacity to wonder is directly proportional to our capacity to receive and our capacity to receive is a 'function' of consciousness. By standing in contemplation before a painting, wonder at the Absolute Mystery can come clearer and this deepening wonder is 'food' for Being, as It is, in and as 'you'. It enhances awareness, stimulates consciousness, and opens the door to the Creative Reality wherein the Very Being of Beauty is eternally Self Created. That Being is Love. There are wonders without end.</p>

</div></div>","Why should you support this work?Is there anything setting my work apart from the, literally, millions of people wielding a brush? I have to answer this, don’t I? If I can’t answer for myself how can I address you, my prospective investor?I wonder if this is the right track? I mean, investors aren't exactly flocking around this endeavor. hmmmm. Oh well, onward and upward! (10/22/14)Oh, well- back to the drawing board- Thanks so much to those that saw fit to contribute!
I have never been motivated to put my work into the human river- although I have dipped my toe in a couple of times. Painting is something I’ve always just taken for granted. I had private lessons from the age of nine- after nagging my parents for two years- and was a kind of an apprentice to a mad Russian, Wassily Somer, for 14 years- from age 13. Money, career, and all that were not part of Wassily’s make-up. Wassily initiated me into an unbroken lineage - through his own teacher Oskar Kokoshka- emerging from prehistory in cave paintings and stone idols. Painting, from this perspective is a Spiritual endeavor. I don’t do it for money. I do it for Love. 
 My life has been defined by ‘spiritual’ pursuits. As I enter my seventh decade, the responsibility to serve this Planet is before me. Perhaps such service is the role of Humanity?  Painting is the quintessential context for me to offer what small contribution I can. In fact, it’s all I have to give. I find therein harmonious active engagement of all three aspects of the Whole - focused in a ‘being gesture’ that presents an object rooted in the depths of the instant. This object is a painting. 
Each and every one of us is a miracle walking around in a miracle- beautiful beyond description. My work, inadequate though it must inevitably be, dives into that miracle, holds it in paint and color, and is set adrift into the Human river to work as it will. 
I feel strongly that this is work that needs to be done- that I must do as a matter of Conscience. I feel that it is of Real Value- both now and, perhaps more important, for the future- if we Human Beings have a future. I, for one, believe that we do.                     (Leda- study for the triptych 'Solve et Coagula' project website)See some of the perks here- examples
See Daybreak ($1000 perk) here- unique

All of the perks available are worth more than the amount requested- yours is an investment, not a gift.
'Frozen Sun (breath of the Love Monster)' This is a digital approximation of what I call a 'procedural painting' that depends on the unpredictable interaction of incompatible materials for the final effect.



                         What do I intend to do?

Hallway of Mirrors, Anatomy of the Instant


This project consists of ten major paintings arranged in a circular installation. Each painting will be facing into the circle, mutually emphasizing each other.  Yet they are discreet in themselves. ( project website ) Three paintings will serve as anchors  tying the installation into a whole. These paintings are interrelated from three perspectives- it is, it is what it is, and it is how it is. The instant is dissected into three fundamental aspects- time, the timelessness of pure potency, and the 'unsayable impetus' or ‘will’ that states identity- in and as a single instance. Follow your eyes- what lights your attention lights the instant. This is the functioning of the installation as a whole- to light the instant.


Over the years I have experimented with a variety of techniques. Some of these are very intriguing. ( a selection ) The seemingly unrelated will be seen in context as of the same source, the same hand, the same heart. Every single painting, every brush stroke, is dedicated to, and is in, Love. 


Here is the lineage rooted in the dim mists of prehistory, the wonder that is the Human Reality. The Reality tasted in... lamplight flickering on the walls of a cave in France, the scent of the air in the Suleimaniyya Mosque, the echo of a medicine song chanted from a sacred peak, the profound silence in a Gothic cathedral- completely present with the immediacy of this instant, this now. Diving into this continuum in paint and color, references to Alchemy, Zen , Sufism , Taoism , and George Gurdjieff's challenge to ‘wake up’ and see come to bear. The project is unbound by any of this. Every instant is miraculous and whatever ‘stew’ savors of this miracle is of it. After all is said and done, there simply is. 


This project is the contemplation of the instant in one instance. It will inevitably be colored by that instance- but, given that the instant is  miraculous, one miraculous instance cannot but resonate with every instance- for every instance is of the instant. The present moment is without hierarchy or division. 


 I thank you for considering  this effort. I ask, most humbly, for your financial investment toward the actualization of it. We will truly be co-creators as we step into the Synergistic Epoch, wherein beckons the promise of a future for Humanity- one that is dynamic and evolutionary- that is, in short, responsible.

                     What I'm asking for and why


Rat Factory, Square One: ‘Hallway of Mirrors (The Anatomy of the Instant)’
                                                  ‘...better late than never...’ 


                  (Kingfisher- study for triptych 'Solve et Coagula' project website)
I will produce a series of ten paintings as detailed above. I will also set up an introductory display through which to enter the Project Space consisting of select paintings and drawings already on hand totaling forty additional works. This Project will be staged for three months, amidst ongoing promotional efforts via several appropriate avenues. All work will be available for sale. The Project, with your help, will also serve as a basis from which to seek commission work and to pursue sustained patronage- settting the stage for the next Project. In other words establishing the foundation for an ongoing business. Thus, ‘Rat Factory’ encompassing production and sales/marketing, management etc. under a single fluid model free from physical location, enabling efforts on a Global scale. 


                                                              


                                                              First steps first. 



The funds I have available will allow me to work for four months. I’ve already invested four months of work. ( project website ) My best estimate is that I need four additional months- plus the four I already have covered- to finish these ten paintings by June. That leaves four months to finance. I have concluded that it will take at minimum $9250 to bring everything to completion and ready to stage. Add to that the percentage due for the campaign itself and the cost of time and materials- shipping etc- to fulfill the perks that figure can be rounded to $11,000 Once  financing is in place to ensure the time and materials to produce these paintings the energy currently being directed to fundraising can be redirected to securing a display venue. A marketing plan will commence as the work progresses. Several potential venues are lurking in the background but it wouldn’t make sense to pursue them until I know when I can deliver. 
In addition to offering fifty pieces of Artwork for sale, people will be able to make contributions. Many people recognize the value in Art and wish to support the Arts but feel themselves excluded from doing so.  Crowdfunding allows people to play a real, direct role in the creation of something with the potential to open new possibilities into the World.  
One of the chief aims of the Project ‘Hallway of Mirrors’ is to establish momentum for what I am calling ‘The Rat Factory’ as an ongoing, self-sustainable business. This format, involving discreet yet interrelated projects staged for periods of three months each, can be duplicated anywhere, as well as opening opportunities as yet unknown. The vision motivating this modest beginning is Global in scope.  
As I see it we are all eddies in a single river- the Human river, which in it's turn is an eddy in the Sea of Life unfettered. So I ask for your investment- moral and financial- in a synergistic effort to remember the miracle that is that river, flowing through each and every one of us. 
Please, see the perks available and give your financial support to this effort. It's an investment in the future.                                             
                                                                     Thank you

at USF. Furthermore,
this is a group project where everyone will have a job in designing, writing,
or editing the catalogue.  A publication of this scope will build the
confidence and pride of the work produced by USF’s students. Not only will the
funds allocated to this publication provide a clear and resounding voice for
its graduate students – a crucial opportunity at a university dominated by its
undergraduate students – but will serve as a tangible reminder that USF is an

WHAT (Writing, History, Art & Theory) at the University of South Florida
is hoping to raise enough money in order to publish MFA catalogues for the
graduating class of 2015!  Our goal is to
raise $5000 so we can print 500 copies of a high quality 50-page catalogue. 
The publication of this catalogue would give us the
opportunity to team up with MFAO (Masters of Fine Arts Organization), our
sister organization, and to gain experience interacting with and writing about
contemporary art and artists.  The publication of an MFA catalogue is an academic
and fine arts initiative that supports the exemplary work of graduate students
at USF. Furthermore,
this is a group project where everyone will have a job in designing, writing,
or editing the catalogue.  A publication of this scope will build the
confidence and pride of the work produced by USF’s students. Not only will the
funds allocated to this publication provide a clear and resounding voice for
its graduate students – a crucial opportunity at a university dominated by its
undergraduate students – but will serve as a tangible reminder that USF is an
advocate for the fine arts community within its own student body, the larger
area of Tampa Bay, and the international arts community at large.  Only you can help make this happen!Our team of graduate art historians includes: Marlena Antonucci, Tracey Cole, Laura Colkitt, Mary Gilpin, Shanna Goodwin, Andrea Johnson, David Loisel, Chris Long, Bryce McWhinnie, Amanda Preuss, Ali Terndrup and Erin Wilson.

</h3> <p>We all have fears. In a Fool's Journey, artist Lucien Shapiro begins a journey that offers guests the opportunity to place one of their fears into a vessel. <br/></p>
<p>In this journey, Shapiro will travel to various regions across the country, performing 
two interactive rituals that focus on the collecting and relinquishing of fear and 
the journey of finding self and light, and screening a new film ANALECTS. <br/></p>
<p>The project began with a 
debut in Los Angeles, and will continue as he travels towards the East Coast from the West Coast. The event will 
start with a film screening that takes on a see no evil, hear no evil, 
speak no evil exploration of slowly losing the senses and an attempt to 
regain what was lost, starring Lucien himself and his sculptures.</p>This project is entirely self funded, and all events related to it are free to the public. Additional funding from this indiegogo campaign will help the artist recoup out-of-pocket costs from the Ritual. In making the choice to back this project, you will help the artist continue to his last destination where all of the fears he collected on the journey will be relinquished in a final ceremony. <br/><br/><p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>GOAL: $10,000</b></p>
<p>Your donation will contribute in 2 big ways:</p>
<p>1. <b>Supporting the artist</b> <b>in his quest to encourage participants to be brave </b>enough to stand before strangers and place their fear into the Fear Relinquishing Vessel. <br/></p>
<p>2. <b>Enabling the project to make a full circle.</b>  Everything must come full circle. While this journey will traverse the country, it begins in Los Angeles. Shapiro intends on also ending the journey in his home state of California, a place where he feels safe for the final ceremony.<br/></p>
<p>A preview of our perks:</p>

<h3>Lucien Shapiro's Film Screening and Ritual<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Analect Rituals is
a take on see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil, and explores a symbolic
loss of speech, hearing, and sight. As each of the senses is lost, a different
mask is worn, and Shapiro goes on a quest for understanding in an attempt to
regain what was lost. This is a project filmed by Shaun Roberts and scored by
Edison, and is starring Lucien Shapiro and his artwork.</p>Symbolic of the continual
search for guidance along the path of life, the Light Collector Ritual
evidences the fact that the light we seek simply exists within ourselves. The ritual requires a constant circle of light, walking out of the
darkness one faces through the realization of the light held within, and the
journey does not end. <br/><p></p> </div><br/><div> <h3>Follow the Journey<br/>
</h3>Even if you can't make a donation, you are encouraged to follow Lucien on his Fool's Journey in a couple of ways:<br/><ul>

</div></div>","Fear Collecting Ritual: A Fools Journey
 We all have fears. In a Fool's Journey, artist Lucien Shapiro begins a journey that offers guests the opportunity to place one of their fears into a vessel. 
In this journey, Shapiro will travel to various regions across the country, performing 
two interactive rituals that focus on the collecting and relinquishing of fear and 
the journey of finding self and light, and screening a new film ANALECTS. 
The project began with a 
debut in Los Angeles, and will continue as he travels towards the East Coast from the West Coast. The event will 
start with a film screening that takes on a see no evil, hear no evil, 
speak no evil exploration of slowly losing the senses and an attempt to 
regain what was lost, starring Lucien himself and his sculptures.This project is entirely self funded, and all events related to it are free to the public. Additional funding from this indiegogo campaign will help the artist recoup out-of-pocket costs from the Ritual. In making the choice to back this project, you will help the artist continue to his last destination where all of the fears he collected on the journey will be relinquished in a final ceremony.  
What We Need & What You Get

GOAL: $10,000
Your donation will contribute in 2 big ways:
1. Supporting the artist in his quest to encourage participants to be brave enough to stand before strangers and place their fear into the Fear Relinquishing Vessel. 
2. Enabling the project to make a full circle.  Everything must come full circle. While this journey will traverse the country, it begins in Los Angeles. Shapiro intends on also ending the journey in his home state of California, a place where he feels safe for the final ceremony.
A preview of our perks:

Fear Relinquishing 4 x 6 Photo Print signed by the artist and photographer

16 x 24 Photo Print signed by the artist and photographer
Set of Limited Time Prints

Growth Vessel
Mask
Fear Protection Weapon

Fear Candle Holders
Invitation to Final Ceremony (space limited)



Lucien Shapiro's Film Screening and Ritual



The Analect Rituals is
a take on see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil, and explores a symbolic
loss of speech, hearing, and sight. As each of the senses is lost, a different
mask is worn, and Shapiro goes on a quest for understanding in an attempt to
regain what was lost. This is a project filmed by Shaun Roberts and scored by
Edison, and is starring Lucien Shapiro and his artwork.Symbolic of the continual
search for guidance along the path of life, the Light Collector Ritual
evidences the fact that the light we seek simply exists within ourselves. The ritual requires a constant circle of light, walking out of the
darkness one faces through the realization of the light held within, and the
journey does not end.   Follow the Journey
Even if you can't make a donation, you are encouraged to follow Lucien on his Fool's Journey in a couple of ways:
Come support an event in your town and relinquish a fear with the artist

Can't make it to an event? Mail your fear to PO Box 283 S.R CA 95402 (all mail must be sent before July 31st)

We are passionate about art, community, and we love our hometown.</div><div><br/></div><div>This campaign is about bringing the Moonlight Market to life. Imagine walking beneath the desert sky into a market that lights up the night with art and creativity. Imagine a place that supports the most talented artisans and crafters in the state. Moonlight Market will inspire and delight you as you discover many local treasures; plus it is just a stroll away from some of the best breweries and distilleries in town.  </div><div><br/></div><div>Stop by the market and meet up with friends for dinner for a perfect evening out!</div><div><br/></div>When you contribute to this campaign, you are helping us to build our dream.

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What We Need and What You Get</b></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise funds to help with the many start up costs that come with launching a new business. Things like licenses’, rent, insurance, and of course, boat loads of lights!  </p>
<br/><p>We have been saving for and planning to launch the Moonlight Market for the past year. Finding the right rental property and neighborhood to launch the market has been more challenging than we could have imagined. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have powered through the disappointment of several leasing opportunities for “the perfect space” that fell through. In May, we stumbled across the actual perfect space, which happens to belong to a kind, generous, flexible, and patient man that we are honored to know.  Logistics require us to open the market somewhat sooner than we had planned, but this is an opportunity that we cannot pass up. We can’t do it without you! </p>
<br/><p>In exchange for your contribution, not only will you be helping us to create one of the most unique places in town and an amazing community of people, but you will also get some really fun perks!  Our rewards include Moonlight Market gear, your name in lights,  as well as opportunities for merchants to get in on the ground floor of this business.  We expect our first season to be a wonderful success and we hope you will be a part of it. </p>
<br/><p>Our goal is to raise $5000.</p>
<br/><p>If we do not reach the full monetary goal of this campaign, the raised funds will go entirely to the launch of the Moonlight Market.  This is truly a passion project for us and our primary goal is to make it come to life!  All profits made this season will be reinvested in the market to grow and enhance it next season.</p>
<br/>We truly adore our landlord, and are excited about paying him first. The more we do raise, the more we will be able to advertise and and promote our market and to bring our merchants together with awesome customers who support their work! </div><div>
<p><span><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p><span><b>Why Support Us</b></span></p>
<p>As artists, we understand the difficulties of trying to find a place to show and sell our creations.  Most of the markets, craft fairs, and art shows in Albuquerque (which are awesome by the way) fill up months in advance, and it is challenging for those new to the business to get a space.  We have experienced this frustration first hand!  We know that there is plenty of room in our city for Moonlight Market.  A unique market that introduces locals and tourists to our merchants’ work.  We are excited to promote our merchants and the other spaces where they sell their work whether it is online or at another market.  We are firm believers in abundance. </p>
<br/><p>New Mexico is a unique place and we are excited to showcase some of the best it has to offer while supporting the artists themselves.  We are looking forward to serving our merchants and customers alike.  We want to build relationships with our merchants and create a community of people who can depend on one another.  </p>
<br/><p>Each of our backgrounds and skill sets work perfectly together to support each aspect of this business.  Our experience includes large scale event planning and coordination, holiday craft fair development and management, business marketing, PR campaign management, recruitment, HR management, website development and social media management, and most importantly 15+ years of visual merchandising and retail management with a ridiculous track record of successful sales and team building - Sorry Jessica, I have to be honest about your skills! </p>
<br/>Together, we have the experience to successfully operate, manage, promote, and grow this market.  We have the skills necessary to provide our merchants with the support that every small business owner needs.  We have a passion and love for art, for New Mexico, and for supporting the unique culture that our state has to offer.</div><div>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span><b>Risks, Pitfalls, and Challenges</b></span></p>
<p>We are aware that there will be difficulties along the way.  There is always a learning curve with any new venture.  Who knew that zoning laws were so complicated?  We didn’t, but now we do.  New Mexico could have a 3 month monsoon season, which would be an issue for an outdoor market. </p>
<br/>We are dedicated to meeting any such obstacles head on.  We are problem solvers and have spent years building the businesses of others.  We can’t wait to finally start building our own!</div><div><br/></div><div>

Now in its fourth season, Free City takes on the theme of Motion and Play inviting installations, sculptures, projections, and performances employing movement of objects and people through unexpected, unexplainable, and uncanny means. In its investigation of the phenomenology of motion, Free City 2016 invites artists and participants to ask: How do we move? For what purpose?</p>
<p>Free City is a large-scale public art festival that temporarily reclaims the former Flint-Chevy manufacturing site along the Flint River for public use. The festival features music, dance, and theater performances, art installations, and hands‐on workshops all free and open to the public to reconnect residents to the Chevy Commons site and its future potential.

It supports collaborations among local residents and organizations as well as with leading artists, architects, planners and community organizers from around the world, connecting Flint to regional, national, and global movements to revitalize neighborhoods and cities though art and design.

A critical mass of temporary activities turn the abandoned industrial property into an active public space, highlighting the ongoing transformation of Flint.
Flint Public Art Project (FPAP) invites you to help make this festival possible by making a donation today. Our goal of $10,000will support fees, expenses, and materials for emerging artists, providing them a platform to explore their work and give audiences Flint Unexpected experiences.  
This year, approximately 3,000 attendees from the wonderfully diverse communities of Flint, southeast Michigan, and beyond will attendthe Free City events. Due to the Social Disruption of the Flint water this year’s festival is more important than ever. The event will bring vital energy and enjoyment to a community that has experienced such upheaval for the past year.
FPAP’s mission is to organize public events, workshops and temporary installations to inspire residents to reimagine the city, reclaim vacant and underutilized buildings and lots, and use innovative tools to steer Flint’s long-range planning. It supports collaborations among local residents and organizations as well as with leading artists, architects, planners and community organizers from around the world, connecting Flint to regional, national, and global movements to revitalize neighborhoods and cities though art and design. The project documents and amplifies the many ways local residents, businesses, and institutions are transforming Flint and its public image and identity, and broadcasting this story to audiences throughout the city and the world.

<h3>CURIOUS CABINETS</h3>
<p>15 artists from around the UK have come together to put on an exhibition with a difference! From a variety of different disciplines and backgrounds, the Curious Cabinets artists are inspired by Cabinets of Curiosity. The exhibition will include work by dress makers, craftsmen, photographers, painters and more.</p>
<p>We want to raise money to allow us to put on an exciting and mysterious exhibition that offers an alternative event for Halloween.</p>
<p>By helping us to raise money we hope to provide a Private View  of the exhibition on the opening night (which all contributors will be welcome to attend), as well as helping us to buy the materials needed to stage the exhibition. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The exhibition opens on Friday 21st October with a Private View 6-8pm</p>
<p>The exhibition then runs daily from 22nd October - 3rd November</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are looking to raise £500. This will be used to pay for materials to set up the exhibition (e.g. plaster board, paint, fabric etc.) as well as to pay for a drinks licence and refreshments for the Private View.</p>
<p>Any remaining money will be shared out between participating artists to help towards the cost of making work.</p>
<p>This project is receiving no further funding and even the smallest contribution will make a huge difference.</p>
<p>In return for your contributions, the artists have prepared a range of perks for you to select from, including original artworks, artists book, posters and prints. Perks start from just £1 so make sure you take a look at what's on offer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal the exhibition will still go ahead, but we will not be able to put on such a lavish show. We want to give visitors an experience to remember, thinking about the texture and atmosphere in the exhibition space, as well as just the artwork on display. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Between us, we have put on many successful exhibitions, and attracted hundred of visitors. This time we aim to do something a little different, and we hope you will share in our vision.</p>

<p><u><strong>Meet the artists</strong></u></p>
<p>This group of artists came together from a shared interest in cabinets of Curiosity and an ambition to put together this exhibition. </p>
<p><strong>Gill Alderson</strong></p>
<p>Gill's current practice is based on an ongoing interest in contemporary drawing practice. Gill draws on unusual and unpredictable surfaces in order to challenge her own language of drawing. Often the materials chosen to work with have been domestically sourced. Intrigued by the molding and reshaping of materials to create objects or environments that suggest hidden narratives, the work is often accompanied by an air of disquiet. Often this disquiet suggests performance within the installations constructed.</p>

<p>Sue's work is influenced by memories of growing up in the 1960s, in a social structure where most of the women she knew did low paid, repetitive and task orientated work. These women were feisty and lively, supporting one another and the agency and determination to care for their families while working long hours, I find inspirational.  Another influence is Emily Bronte, who along with her siblings needed to find work outside the home in order to support herself. I find aspects of her life and personality intriguing and would love to have met her. </p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to look at our campaign. We realise that many people may be interested in our project without being able to contribute any money, but we would also really appreciate you helping us to spread the word.<br/>One of the biggest challenges in Crowdfunding is reaching new people, and you can really help us by sharing links to our campaign with friends and family. <br/>Everyone is welcome to come along to the exhibition, which will be FREE and open to the public from 22nd October - 3rd November.

</div></div>","CURIOUS CABINETS
15 artists from around the UK have come together to put on an exhibition with a difference! From a variety of different disciplines and backgrounds, the Curious Cabinets artists are inspired by Cabinets of Curiosity. The exhibition will include work by dress makers, craftsmen, photographers, painters and more.
We want to raise money to allow us to put on an exciting and mysterious exhibition that offers an alternative event for Halloween.
By helping us to raise money we hope to provide a Private View  of the exhibition on the opening night (which all contributors will be welcome to attend), as well as helping us to buy the materials needed to stage the exhibition. 
 
The exhibition opens on Friday 21st October with a Private View 6-8pm
The exhibition then runs daily from 22nd October - 3rd November
 

What We Need & What You Get
 
We are looking to raise £500. This will be used to pay for materials to set up the exhibition (e.g. plaster board, paint, fabric etc.) as well as to pay for a drinks licence and refreshments for the Private View.
Any remaining money will be shared out between participating artists to help towards the cost of making work.
This project is receiving no further funding and even the smallest contribution will make a huge difference.
In return for your contributions, the artists have prepared a range of perks for you to select from, including original artworks, artists book, posters and prints. Perks start from just £1 so make sure you take a look at what's on offer.
 
If we don't reach our goal the exhibition will still go ahead, but we will not be able to put on such a lavish show. We want to give visitors an experience to remember, thinking about the texture and atmosphere in the exhibition space, as well as just the artwork on display. 
 
Between us, we have put on many successful exhibitions, and attracted hundred of visitors. This time we aim to do something a little different, and we hope you will share in our vision.
 

Meet the artists
This group of artists came together from a shared interest in cabinets of Curiosity and an ambition to put together this exhibition. 
Gill Alderson
Gill's current practice is based on an ongoing interest in contemporary drawing practice. Gill draws on unusual and unpredictable surfaces in order to challenge her own language of drawing. Often the materials chosen to work with have been domestically sourced. Intrigued by the molding and reshaping of materials to create objects or environments that suggest hidden narratives, the work is often accompanied by an air of disquiet. Often this disquiet suggests performance within the installations constructed.

Gill is offering an artist book entitled Punctum as a Crowdfunding Perk.

<h3><strong>Bref résumé</strong></h3>
<p><br/>Je roule ma bosse comme illustratrice et travailleuse autonome depuis plus de 5 ans déjà. J'adore ça, même si la part d'insécurité financière qui vient avec est de plus en plus pesante.<br/><br/>Suite à mon déménagement à Montréal dans la dernière année, j'ai dû me résigner à reprendre un travail alimentaire pour m'aider terminer mes mois en un seul morceau, souvent de justesse. Cet emploi à temps partiel me coupe une grande part du temps que je peux allouer à la recherche de nouveaux contrats d'illustration et à mes projets personnels sans me sortir de la précarité financière.</p>
<p>Le tatouage, je vois ça comme un nouveau défi pour me redonner de l'estime personnelle à court terme et l'autonomie financière à plus long terme. J'aspire à faire cohabiter ces deux métiers intimement liés, l'illustration et le tatouage (en plus de mes projets de collage) pour qu'ils se nourrissent l'un de l'autre. <br/><br/>Je sais que je ne ferai pas l'unanimité en choisissant de travailler à mon domicile plutôt qu'en salon, mais pour avoir expérimenté les deux en tant que cliente, j'ai de loin préféré la chaleur et la convivialité du studio maison, et c'est ce que je veux offrir à ma future clientèle. Ainsi, je préfère prendre moins de clients et prendre le temps de discuter avec chacun(e) de ses envies et inquiétudes afin de donner le meilleur service possible</p>
<h3><strong> Ce dont j'ai besoin</strong></h3>
<p>Ma mentor, qui m'apprend à encrer la peau de façon aussi jolie que sécuritaire, m'a aidée à élaborer une liste du matériel dont j'aurai besoin pour commencer à zéro. <br/>En voici une version simplifiée:</p>
<ul>
<li> Une machine rotative, le power supply, le cable et une pédale;</li>
<li>Les aiguilles (liners et shaders de différentes tailles) et tubes;</li>
<li>Les encres, le papier thermique, du matériel à dessin</li>
<li>Tout le matériel d'hygiène (gants, sacs protecteurs pour les fils, la machine et la bouteille, du saran wrap, des bavoirs dentaires, du defend barrier film, du savon vert, du liquide antiseptique, du désinfectant de surface, etc. ) et plein d'autres cossins indispensables (Papier thermique, gobelets pour l'encre, bouteille, abaisse-langues, masking tape, rasoirs jetables, essuies-tout, Vaseline, etc)</li>
<li>Ainsi tout ce qu'il me manque pour aménager mon atelier en un environnement confortable et stérile. ( Une table à massage, un petit banc qui roule, une lampe, des rideaux, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Ce que vous obtenez</strong></h3>

</div><p> </p></div>","Bref résumé
Je roule ma bosse comme illustratrice et travailleuse autonome depuis plus de 5 ans déjà. J'adore ça, même si la part d'insécurité financière qui vient avec est de plus en plus pesante.Suite à mon déménagement à Montréal dans la dernière année, j'ai dû me résigner à reprendre un travail alimentaire pour m'aider terminer mes mois en un seul morceau, souvent de justesse. Cet emploi à temps partiel me coupe une grande part du temps que je peux allouer à la recherche de nouveaux contrats d'illustration et à mes projets personnels sans me sortir de la précarité financière.
Le tatouage, je vois ça comme un nouveau défi pour me redonner de l'estime personnelle à court terme et l'autonomie financière à plus long terme. J'aspire à faire cohabiter ces deux métiers intimement liés, l'illustration et le tatouage (en plus de mes projets de collage) pour qu'ils se nourrissent l'un de l'autre. Je sais que je ne ferai pas l'unanimité en choisissant de travailler à mon domicile plutôt qu'en salon, mais pour avoir expérimenté les deux en tant que cliente, j'ai de loin préféré la chaleur et la convivialité du studio maison, et c'est ce que je veux offrir à ma future clientèle. Ainsi, je préfère prendre moins de clients et prendre le temps de discuter avec chacun(e) de ses envies et inquiétudes afin de donner le meilleur service possible
 Ce dont j'ai besoin
Ma mentor, qui m'apprend à encrer la peau de façon aussi jolie que sécuritaire, m'a aidée à élaborer une liste du matériel dont j'aurai besoin pour commencer à zéro. En voici une version simplifiée:

 Une machine rotative, le power supply, le cable et une pédale;
Les aiguilles (liners et shaders de différentes tailles) et tubes;
Les encres, le papier thermique, du matériel à dessin
Tout le matériel d'hygiène (gants, sacs protecteurs pour les fils, la machine et la bouteille, du saran wrap, des bavoirs dentaires, du defend barrier film, du savon vert, du liquide antiseptique, du désinfectant de surface, etc. ) et plein d'autres cossins indispensables (Papier thermique, gobelets pour l'encre, bouteille, abaisse-langues, masking tape, rasoirs jetables, essuies-tout, Vaseline, etc)
Ainsi tout ce qu'il me manque pour aménager mon atelier en un environnement confortable et stérile. ( Une table à massage, un petit banc qui roule, une lampe, des rideaux, etc.)

Ce que vous obtenez
C'est là que ça devient intéressant pour vous! En plus d'avoir désormais dans votre entourage une nouvelle tatoueuse motivée et consciencieuse, vous recevrez DES AFFAIRES! LISTE DES AFFAIRES:

Dans ta boîte aux lettres toute l'année! 25$Même principe, mais reçois ou fais envoyer 5 cartes surprise réparties tout au long de l'année avec des messages personnalisés pour te faire sourire au milieu des factures quand tu t'y attendras le moins.

<p> </p>
<p>c) did it on Youtube with some silly gimmick like, “Hear the Appassionata——while Joe lights his hair on FIRE!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>          I decided it was of more utility to pursue accompanying for my Masters—after all, there’s clearly a need for an accompanist with the numbers of singers in New York, right? Well, yes, but after that degree, I found out that anybody can ask for an accompanist to show up anywhere in New York for $25/hr, with no guarantee the job would happen, OR guarantee that there would be any more hours than that, and yes….everytime someone posted on Facebook for one, they got it. So the demand was….only as high as that. I wasn’t exactly an escalator repairman….my skills were slowly becoming more expendable as the college graduation rates for “collaborative artists” was increasing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>         So, seeing all the flaming hoops I had to go through to just play one piece of Beethoven as a “professional”, I decided I’d stop trying to vie for supremacy in a world with ever-decreasing opportunities from the established outlets, and try to spend the rest of my life making it easier for people, like me, that JUST wanted to play some classical music, be appreciated, and have a little something for their daily bread. If that meant I had to become 24/7 morally good Lex Luthor, so be it, the world needs it now, that I know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Breakdown of Costs: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each concert, I give $40 to three performers, $30 to an artist for a program and poster, $90 to the venue thanking them for putting us up, providing storage space, helping further our cause, and $40 to me for booking everyone and organizing it, which comes down to:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$40x3=$120</p>
<p>$30+$90=$120</p>
<p>=$240+$40=$280</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A goal of $3600 would keep us is in business for a year; my recording on the video says 2 years, but it was a good take, and I made all the recording myself, so give me a break, if you read this whole thing, I feel like you’ll forgive the time discrepancy. Additionally, I’m going to want to fundraise for slightly more expensive projects, such as paying for a performance of the last Beethoven Quartet, so….this assumes that it was rigidly the same month to month, which it will be, unless I hire people for a performance of a Beethoven Quartet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Perks: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Donate anything above $100-I’ll play for you</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I don’t reach my goal: I’ll try again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The impact of your donation here will mean that the world still values live music, and music performed without the micro managerial clout of education or religious observance guiding it. I want there to be a child that can hear Ravel’s Alborada Del Gracioso which WASN’T part of a music appreciation course, or part of Communion at a church. You’re supporting music for music’s sake, for the rich traditions it has always represented, for the geniuses that it produced, because of MUSIC. And yes, I do believe this does connect to the cosmic beyond and all that good stuff, and when people say Bach did everything for God, I think this is the same person we’re trying to connect to as well, minus the political and social constrictions and connotations.</p>

A goal of $3600 would keep us is in business for a year; my recording on the video says 2 years, but it was a good take, and I made all the recording myself, so give me a break, if you read this whole thing, I feel like you’ll forgive the time discrepancy. Additionally, I’m going to want to fundraise for slightly more expensive projects, such as paying for a performance of the last Beethoven Quartet, so….this assumes that it was rigidly the same month to month, which it will be, unless I hire people for a performance of a Beethoven Quartet.
 
Perks: 
 
Donate anything above $100-I’ll play for you
 
If I don’t reach my goal: I’ll try again.
 
The impact of your donation here will mean that the world still values live music, and music performed without the micro managerial clout of education or religious observance guiding it. I want there to be a child that can hear Ravel’s Alborada Del Gracioso which WASN’T part of a music appreciation course, or part of Communion at a church. You’re supporting music for music’s sake, for the rich traditions it has always represented, for the geniuses that it produced, because of MUSIC. And yes, I do believe this does connect to the cosmic beyond and all that good stuff, and when people say Bach did everything for God, I think this is the same person we’re trying to connect to as well, minus the political and social constrictions and connotations.

<h4>Why is this project important?</h4>
<p>What do we mean when we say ""human rights""? What do these rights<i> look like</i> to us? Do we envision physical suffering, structural inequality, individual triumph, communal resilience, or a history of achievements to be celebrated? The answer matters to the way we understand the world and how to change it. However, we seem to have become so familiar with the term ""human rights"" that we rarely question what it actually means, where it comes from, or what its future is. This exhibition seeks to change that by re-examining the <b>new world image</b> that was built up around human rights in the aftermath of the Second World War and juxtaposing this image with the way human rights are visualized today.  </p>

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What was the original Human Rights Exhibition?</b></h3>
<blockquote><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">“...to ensure that 20th-century man shall not merely approve the Declaration of Rights but appeal to it constantly and as a matter of course, and shall understand that, if he makes it a part of his life, he will never have a charter that is worth more to him.”</span></blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Jaime Torres-Bodet, Director-General of UNESCO in 1949</p>
<p>In 1948, the UN adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This has become a widely celebrated and cited document, but in 1948 no one really knew what it was supposed to mean in concrete terms, and very few even knew that it existed. To address this problem, the UN’s Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) organized an exhibition that was supposed to explain in visual terms how human rights had emerged in cultures around the world since the beginning of time. They invited all of their fifty member states to submit materials, and carefully curated these submissions into a compelling new history of humankind. After the exhibition opened in Paris on 30 September 1949, it was sent in a smaller version to countries around the world. </p>
<br/><h3>The project:  re-display and new material</h3>
<p>We now live in a time when Jaime Torres-Bodet's goal seems to have been reached: We appeal to human rights constantly and as a matter of course - but have they come to seem so self-evident that we don't reflect on their meaning anymore? Through a re-display of this historical exhibition for the first time since its inception, we want to contribute to a contemporary debate about the meaning and visual culture of human rights. We've already made one exhibition in New York this spring in partnership with Columbia University's Institute for the Study of Human Rights and the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. This event made it clear to us what an amazing platform this material is for reflection and critical discussion. </p>

<h4>Photo-competition and building a new visual archive</h4>
<p>We have also teamed up with the Danish Institute of Human Rights, who have organized a photo competition about the meaning of human rights in Denmark today (read more about the competition - in Danish - here: <a href=""http://menneskeret.dk/kalender/fotokonkurrence-menneskerettigheder-dag-danmark)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://menneskeret.dk/kalender/fotokonkurrence-menneskerettigheder-dag-danmark</a>).

<h3><b>How this project was born</b></h3>
<p>Eva and Katrine are both from Denmark and met three years ago after coming to New York to study history and human rights. While writing a paper about human rights and museums, Katrine came across a reference to the Human Rights Exhibition in a UNESCO publication from 1949 (Eva still remembers the day Katrine showed her a printed copy of this little reference, having no idea how much this would shape both of our futures). With a little more research into this seemingly forgotten event, it turned out that original copies of the traveling exhibition still existed, for example in an antiquarian bookstore in Israel and in Maryland, USA. </p>
<p>We decided that the world needed to see these, and founded the Human Rights Exhibition Project after we had finished our studies. Columbia University’s Institute for the Study of Human Rights offered to host us, and that’s where we’ve been based for the past year. We have spent this time doing research; building a presence for the project; organizing a lecture series, workshops, and a symposium; and most importantly, making an exhibition titled <a href=""http://www.exhibithumanrights.org/visualizing-universalism/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.exhibithumanrights.org/visualizing-universalism/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'Visualizing Universalism'</a> that opened in April this year. You can see more about the Human Rights Exhibition Project on our <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/a-new-world-image-traveling-exhibition/edit/www.exhibithumanrights.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in the capable hands of our project architect, Simon, the exhibition has been re-conceptualized for travel. This new leg of the project not only references the travels of the original exhibition, but also brings this historical event profoundly into the present by gathering contemporary photographs of human rights at each destination. <br/></p>
</div>
<div>From the beginning, this project has been made possible by the creativity, support, and excitement of people we have met along our way. That's why we're so excited about the opportunity to spread the project's reach through this campaign and the subsequent travels of the exhibition. We hope you'll be part of the journey!</div>

<h4><b>WHY?</b></h4>
<p>Womeet starts from
the dream of three young girls for working on social projects; together with
the opportunity we have to travel to India. We saw that it was a wonderful
opportunity to develop a project related with women. Our objective is to <b>do
our bit to help</b> in the progress of this collective, though the <b>entrepreneurship</b> and
in this way, to create the beginning of the <b>big progress in India.</b></p>
<h4><b>HOW?</b></h4>
<p>Through an
entrepreneur process,<b> based on the theory of the<a href=""http://www.designthinkingbook.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Design Thinking</a></b>,
centered on the team work. The participants will be women of different profiles
(students, public sector workers, responsible of a family business, etc) with
one similar point on common: the interest on developing new projects and their
dreams to make a progress on their surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of the
Design Thinking in based on <b>4 phases</b>: observation, ideation,
prototype and testing. The objective is to learn this tool though the practise,
in this way this women could learn the theory in the practise; or which is the
same; learning by doing.</p>
<p>The project is based
on <b>two pillars</b>: the unity and the learning.</p>
<p>The unity is because
we encourage the team work. We will be there and we will work ith them and we
will help them to develop the projects, being always the women the protagonist
of the project. On the other hand, the knowledge. They will learn from us, in
the same way we will learn a lot from them.</p>
<h4><b>WHAT?</b></h4>
<p>Womeet is a <b>non-profit </b>project,
and that is why we are finding the financing though the Crowdfunding campaign;
to cover the costs of the transport of the project, the orators with
experience, renting the working space and the material.</p>
<p>We will be
only <b>two months</b> in India. It is a very short time if you want
to make a positive impact in the surrounding. It would have a continuity, is
not going to be start one thing and not finishing it; we want to everything
goes well, the project really happen and to have a real change.</p>
<p>The project would be
something near, you would live the experience that are living the women though

Design Thinking in based on 4 phases: observation, ideation,
prototype and testing. The objective is to learn this tool though the practise,
in this way this women could learn the theory in the practise; or which is the
same; learning by doing.
The project is based
on two pillars: the unity and the learning.
The unity is because
we encourage the team work. We will be there and we will work ith them and we
will help them to develop the projects, being always the women the protagonist
of the project. On the other hand, the knowledge. They will learn from us, in
the same way we will learn a lot from them.
WHAT?
Womeet is a non-profit project,
and that is why we are finding the financing though the Crowdfunding campaign;
to cover the costs of the transport of the project, the orators with
experience, renting the working space and the material.
We will be
only two months in India. It is a very short time if you want
to make a positive impact in the surrounding. It would have a continuity, is
not going to be start one thing and not finishing it; we want to everything
goes well, the project really happen and to have a real change.
The project would be
something near, you would live the experience that are living the women though
our social media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the blogs in spanish and english.

<p></p>
<p>You can help
the Moroccan Artist Imad Elbaz create his own Alabaster Stone and Art Gallery, called Imagine Paradise near Ouzoud Falls, Morocco!<span><br/></span></p>
<p>Imad
is a very talented artist who lives near the base of Ouzoud Falls in Morocco.<span>  He is the main resource for artwork in that
area.  If a shop owner needs a sign or a
door painted, they must find Imad.  His
name means Imad the Falcon.  <br/></span></p>
<p><span>The traditions
of the Berbers (Amazigh, “The Free People”) are very important to him, and he
combines traditional with leading-edge techniques in his art pieces.  Now,
Imad would like to establish his own alabaster stone and art shop, and you can help!  <br/></span></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Project Alabaster Stone</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Like
most artists around the world, Imad has struggled to support himself.<span>  Two years ago he worked for a shop and learned
the traditional stone techniques.  The
shop owners asked him to sit outside
carving stone every day, and also manage the store while they traveled.  He carefully
sold items, took care of everything and learned the business well.  In return, they paid him about $10 a week, which is very low pay for this area.  However, Imad relates easily to tourists from many countries, and he knows that they like alabaster!<br/></span></p>
<p>Alabaster
is easy to carve and is extremely beautiful.<span> 
The carvers say it can “bruise” easily, so it’s important to take care
while working with it.  One piece can
take up to three days to carve and polish. 
The tiny figurines are more difficult, and the carver must be very
talented and experienced to create these pieces.  Alabaster stone is stunning, as you know, and
comes in a variety of colors.  <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Now, all Imad needs is
some seed money to meet with elders in the mountains, buy the initial
investment of alabaster stone, register his business, and get some good carving
tools.</span></p>
<p>You
can help Imad be financially independent.<span> Soon we would like to travel to the mountain villages, and take you with us through videos and photos.  When we return to Ouzoud Falls, we will begin to build the art shop.  We've finally chosen a name, IMAGINE PARADISE.  We hope to include a shop, cafe and art gallery.<br/></span></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We have some nice perks, such as getting a portrait made of you or a loved one!  You can also choose from some beautiful Alabaster stone carvings.  Please look at the Gallery for some recent photos.  <br/></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $700 or more.  This amount will
cover all the costs for the alabaster, tools, business registration, and
 transportation.  Any amount will help Imad to build more
financial success.  If we don’t reach our
goal, but do receive some funds, we will do as many steps as we can to
establish Imad’s business.  This is the best
idea for his financial freedom, and we are dedicated to building a 
wonderful
shop and profitable business.</p>
<p>You
will be helping a young man who lives in poverty but intensely desires to
be an entrepreneur.  This project will
transform his life.  And, we’re offering
you some enticing gifts as perks!  Check
them out to the right, and in the details below.</p>
</div><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>We
have heard of the artisans who live in the mountains, and we know the general areas and villages.<span>  But, we have to do some investigative work on
our journey to find them.  This will be fun, challenging and exciting.  However, I

<p></p></div>","Short Summary

You can help
the Moroccan Artist Imad Elbaz create his own Alabaster Stone and Art Gallery, called Imagine Paradise near Ouzoud Falls, Morocco!
Imad
is a very talented artist who lives near the base of Ouzoud Falls in Morocco.  He is the main resource for artwork in that
area.  If a shop owner needs a sign or a
door painted, they must find Imad.  His
name means Imad the Falcon.  
The traditions
of the Berbers (Amazigh, “The Free People”) are very important to him, and he
combines traditional with leading-edge techniques in his art pieces.  Now,
Imad would like to establish his own alabaster stone and art shop, and you can help!  

Project Alabaster Stone

Like
most artists around the world, Imad has struggled to support himself.  Two years ago he worked for a shop and learned
the traditional stone techniques.  The
shop owners asked him to sit outside
carving stone every day, and also manage the store while they traveled.  He carefully
sold items, took care of everything and learned the business well.  In return, they paid him about $10 a week, which is very low pay for this area.  However, Imad relates easily to tourists from many countries, and he knows that they like alabaster!
Alabaster
is easy to carve and is extremely beautiful. 
The carvers say it can “bruise” easily, so it’s important to take care
while working with it.  One piece can
take up to three days to carve and polish. 
The tiny figurines are more difficult, and the carver must be very
talented and experienced to create these pieces.  Alabaster stone is stunning, as you know, and
comes in a variety of colors.  
Now, all Imad needs is
some seed money to meet with elders in the mountains, buy the initial
investment of alabaster stone, register his business, and get some good carving
tools.
You
can help Imad be financially independent. Soon we would like to travel to the mountain villages, and take you with us through videos and photos.  When we return to Ouzoud Falls, we will begin to build the art shop.  We've finally chosen a name, IMAGINE PARADISE.  We hope to include a shop, cafe and art gallery.
   What We Need & What You Get 
We have some nice perks, such as getting a portrait made of you or a loved one!  You can also choose from some beautiful Alabaster stone carvings.  Please look at the Gallery for some recent photos.  
Our goal is to raise $700 or more.  This amount will
cover all the costs for the alabaster, tools, business registration, and
 transportation.  Any amount will help Imad to build more
financial success.  If we don’t reach our
goal, but do receive some funds, we will do as many steps as we can to
establish Imad’s business.  This is the best
idea for his financial freedom, and we are dedicated to building a 
wonderful
shop and profitable business.
You
will be helping a young man who lives in poverty but intensely desires to
be an entrepreneur.  This project will
transform his life.  And, we’re offering
you some enticing gifts as perks!  Check
them out to the right, and in the details below.
 Risks & Challenges  
We
have heard of the artisans who live in the mountains, and we know the general areas and villages.  But, we have to do some investigative work on
our journey to find them.  This will be fun, challenging and exciting.  However, I
have a feeling that we will  meet the individuals who can teach us
the most about stone carving.  I'm delightfully amazed with the amount of kindness and helpful here. 
I’m sure we'll have a lot of assistance that will point us in the right
direction.

Hey there!</h3>
<p>My
names <b>Shiverz/ReddKlaw/Sophie</b> and
I'm passionate about all things creative!</p>
<p>I
have a BA(hons) in animation and I am a professional freelance artist
by trade with almost ten years’ experience.</p>
<p>Originally
from England, I travelled to Japan in search of a different life.
After arriving I amazingly landed my first career in 3D animation.
 Skipping forward to the present, I am still happily living
in Japan and working as a 2D freelance artist, unfortunately I
was unable to continue working in animation due to visa constraints.
I am now hoping to return to the 3D animation industry and expand my
existing freelance art career. In order to advance my goals I need
new equipment, supplies and materials to work with; my current PC is
too outdated to keep up the latest standard animation software, and I
need constant exposure to this software in order to return to remain
viable in this industry.<br/>I work every day is a freelance artist
(outside of my regular day job) art is my life. I am dedicated to my
career as an artist; however dedication alone can only take me so
far. That’s where this campaign comes in, with your wonderfully
generous support and my hard work, dedication, and initiative, I
believe I can make my lifelong dream of becoming a professional full
time animator come true.</p>
<p><b>The
Things I Need To Get Going</b></p>
<p>Ok,
so let’s get to the specifics of what I need to get this thing
started.</p>
<p>First:</p>
<p>The
hardware.</p>
<p>Any
animator knows you need a lot of engine room for animating, or
anything creative. From picture editing to a full length 3D
animation, you need to have the goods to help you create. 
</p>
<p>SO,
to update my system to get into all that animating stuff, I am
looking at one of the following:</p><p><br/></p>

<p>As
you can see, there's a lot to get started. But it's a matter of
getting the ball rolling and riding that creative dream to where I
want to be. I believe it's possible, especially when backed by you
guys!</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p><b>Why
should I believe you?</b></p>
<p>Good
question. Let me throw some lil' Shiv facts at you~</p>
<p>I
am very career driven when you mix this with my one passion in life:
art. I will do whatever I can to succeed. I have a very determined
work ethic and follow my goals to the end. It’s how I ended up in
Japan, and here.</p>
<p>Sounds
cheesy and default, but wait....there's more!</p>
<p>A
good and somewhat perfect example is my long career in art. Starting
from a young age I kept that art desire alive throughout school,
college and eventually I managed to gain a degree at University. This
spans over a good percentage of my life, the university course alone
was four years, so imagine the rest!  Post to this, gaining a
freelance career along as well as employment in several areas within
the industry. I continued my freelance art career even after moving
countries.</p>
<p>Another
point to mention is, well, moving to Japan. Let me put it this way:
If you can imagine moving, not just to another city, or state, but to
a completely different country, than you can imagine how much
planning and drive was required to contemplate the practicality of
moving to Japan, let alone to actually achieve this goal and move
here, establish a life here and try to advance that life. I was not
even dissuaded by the terrible series of events that occurred in
Japan during March 2011. 
</p>
<p>No,
this isn't an ego boost, or me exclaiming how awesome I am, I want to
simply letting you guys know that this isn't the first time I've had
challenging goals. I continue to work, plan, struggle and achieve…
there have been mountains to climb in the past, but with focus and
determination I was able to tackle them (metaphorically speaking,
I’ve never angered a mountain). I am confident that your support is
what I need to push through that final mile and turn my creative
dream into my real world career. 
</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p><b>It's
not just money that can help.</b></p>
<p>Nope!
You can also help by spreading the word too~ Tell your friends,
family, neighbours, that dude you see at the bar sometimes, even your
pets (They can totally understand you). Use those books of face and
those tweetings, it all helps, and it is all deeply deeply
appreciated.</p></div>","Hey there!

<p>Infusion is a Cleveland based, co-ed
performing arts group. Saturday, September 6th, Infusion presents Cleveland's
largest variety show, the seventh annual Sin + Skin! The event will be held at
The Performing Arts Center at The Cleveland Masonic Temple, on the corner
of Euclid and E. 36<sup>th</sup> St. We pack the night full of live music with
varying genres and performance art from across the spectrum. In the down time,
patrons visit our vendors in the lobby to indulge in purchasing both items to
take home and interactive services (i.e. caricature sketches).</p>
<p>After years of searching, we have found the perfect venue. There is plenty of stage and dressing room space, well lit vending space, free secured parking and entrances, air conditioning and everything else our theater loving hearts could possibly desire. The catch is that the room rental is close to double what we have paid previous years; $2500. We fear the increased cost, may decrease the profit. The profit is important, because it is how we pay all of the other acts and bands. On average, we have about 20 acts hit the stage throughout the night. We split the profit among all of the acts. You can see how starting at negative $2500, could pose a problem. Especially when we refuse to charge over $20 for admission. We want our patrons to have the best experience possible. We keep the ticket price low, so that the entire event can be fun and affordable. We want our patrons to be able to attend, play, drink and still have money left over to purchase products from our vendors, if they so choose.</p>
<p>The entire ideology behind our show is to treat the talent, the way we know they should be treated. Too often, local performers, troupes and bands invest a lot of their own money to do what they are passionate about and put on an amazing show for their audiences. Only to have bars, clubs and venues expect them to perform for free, while paying big national acts a ton of money. In our seven years performing  in state and out, and hosting this show, we have seen quite a few things and have learned a lot. A bad experience can crush spirits and ruin performances...whether it be not receiving guaranteed pay or dying of thirst underneath scorching lights, in a venue without air conditioning, on a 80 degree day. A little hospitality, consideration and appreciation, goes a long way. We work hard to give everyone the most fun, relaxed and best experience possible. It is our way of supporting the local arts and showing our appreciation to the community. </p>
<p>Year after year, performers have jumped on the bill without a guaranteed amount of pay, because they trust us. We have proven our intentions and loyalty to the community. Each of them knows they will walk away paid and happy. The amount of pay is only undetermined, due to the many variables that can factor into the show's financial success. The last thing we ever want to do is make a promise we can't keep. They trust we always have their best interest in mind and know the more profit the door makes, the more they make. Thus, giving them the opportunity to invest in their own show, via costuming, props, equipment, etc. Performers put a lot of time, effort and money into bringing ideas to life for the sheer joy of entertaining an audience. Without you and without your support, there is no purpose behind the passion. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We're Asking &amp; What We're Giving</h3>
<div>Funds received from our vendors and sponsors help to pay for the costs encountered prior to show day. Such as: several mediums of design and advertisement, t-shirt design and order, security deposit for the venue, liquor license and alcohol, and food and water for the talent. We really couldn't do it without the immense support we've received over the years.</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Funds received from YOU, the contributor, will go directly toward the cost of the venue. We chose a goal of $2500, because ideally we'd like to start with a zero balance due, day of show, but every bit helps! </span></div> <ul>

Infusion is a Cleveland based, co-ed
performing arts group. Saturday, September 6th, Infusion presents Cleveland's
largest variety show, the seventh annual Sin + Skin! The event will be held at
The Performing Arts Center at The Cleveland Masonic Temple, on the corner
of Euclid and E. 36th St. We pack the night full of live music with
varying genres and performance art from across the spectrum. In the down time,
patrons visit our vendors in the lobby to indulge in purchasing both items to
take home and interactive services (i.e. caricature sketches).
After years of searching, we have found the perfect venue. There is plenty of stage and dressing room space, well lit vending space, free secured parking and entrances, air conditioning and everything else our theater loving hearts could possibly desire. The catch is that the room rental is close to double what we have paid previous years; $2500. We fear the increased cost, may decrease the profit. The profit is important, because it is how we pay all of the other acts and bands. On average, we have about 20 acts hit the stage throughout the night. We split the profit among all of the acts. You can see how starting at negative $2500, could pose a problem. Especially when we refuse to charge over $20 for admission. We want our patrons to have the best experience possible. We keep the ticket price low, so that the entire event can be fun and affordable. We want our patrons to be able to attend, play, drink and still have money left over to purchase products from our vendors, if they so choose.
The entire ideology behind our show is to treat the talent, the way we know they should be treated. Too often, local performers, troupes and bands invest a lot of their own money to do what they are passionate about and put on an amazing show for their audiences. Only to have bars, clubs and venues expect them to perform for free, while paying big national acts a ton of money. In our seven years performing  in state and out, and hosting this show, we have seen quite a few things and have learned a lot. A bad experience can crush spirits and ruin performances...whether it be not receiving guaranteed pay or dying of thirst underneath scorching lights, in a venue without air conditioning, on a 80 degree day. A little hospitality, consideration and appreciation, goes a long way. We work hard to give everyone the most fun, relaxed and best experience possible. It is our way of supporting the local arts and showing our appreciation to the community. 
Year after year, performers have jumped on the bill without a guaranteed amount of pay, because they trust us. We have proven our intentions and loyalty to the community. Each of them knows they will walk away paid and happy. The amount of pay is only undetermined, due to the many variables that can factor into the show's financial success. The last thing we ever want to do is make a promise we can't keep. They trust we always have their best interest in mind and know the more profit the door makes, the more they make. Thus, giving them the opportunity to invest in their own show, via costuming, props, equipment, etc. Performers put a lot of time, effort and money into bringing ideas to life for the sheer joy of entertaining an audience. Without you and without your support, there is no purpose behind the passion. 
   What We're Asking & What We're Giving
Funds received from our vendors and sponsors help to pay for the costs encountered prior to show day. Such as: several mediums of design and advertisement, t-shirt design and order, security deposit for the venue, liquor license and alcohol, and food and water for the talent. We really couldn't do it without the immense support we've received over the years.
Funds received from YOU, the contributor, will go directly toward the cost of the venue. We chose a goal of $2500, because ideally we'd like to start with a zero balance due, day of show, but every bit helps!

AIM
To help restore Typhoon Yolanda victims means of living.
SUMMARY
A Fund Raising Campaign for Typhoon Yolanda victims and 4S (Styles, Strokes and Sketches Society) artists.
For every contribution, an artwork will be given (a Postcard, a Shirt, a Personal or Group Portrait).
ABOUT 4S and this CAMPAIGN
As an organization of Filipino artists, we would like to use our talents to help our fellow artists and countrymen - particularly the victims of Typhoon Yolanda - recover from this hardship by donating funds we gather from this campaign.
The other side of this campaign aims to help aspiring and striving member artists by distributing their works as PERKS for those who will support this project. To help them, we will give proper compensation for their artworks.
In a nutshell, majority of the funds we gather will be donated to the Typhoon Victims. What's left will be used for the creation of PERKS, bank fees and other miscellaneous or administrative expenses.
PERKS
Perks will be in the form of POSTCARDS, T-SHIRTS and personalized PORTRAIT PAINTING (Pen and Ink, Coffee on Strathmore, Acrylic or Oil on Canvas).

2. Postcard Perks will be sent to Contributors via BYPOST.COM
3. Shirts will be sent via Philippine Postal Service or other similar courier services.
4. Portrait Artworks (on canvass) will be sent as First-class Mail.
5. Motorized fishing boats will be constructed in Camarines Norte, Philippines.

We will focus on basic needs of our target communities such as 1. Water containers2. Nutritious Food that can be easily acquired3. Infant formulas and Milk bottles4.

 Toria Garbutt is a spoken word artist from Knottingley - a deprived ex-mining town in West Yorkshire. From as young as 9 she kept a diary, and wrote poetry in parallel.
""Toria's words are silk javelins. Frank explorations of self, outpourings of a joyfully pained mind. She means it. Cos she's lived it. I love that girl"" Mike Garry
Her resulting début album is an incredibly visceral and engaging collection of confessional, observational and character based punk poetry. With a punk heritage, a staccato heartbeat and a unique flair for storytelling, her work is brutally honest yet breathtakingly beautiful.


The album is being released by Nymphs & Thugs Recording Co., and independent spoken word record label formed in spring 2015. This campaign is also supported by A Firm Of Poets; a nationally established spoken word organisation that provided Toria with a national platform, and ultimately paved the way to this release.
    Funding requirements Right, so this is where we're at financially...  
Manufacturing the albums: £400- 250x professionally manufactured CDs with on-disc artwork- Recorded at Eiger Studios in Leeds- Cardboard sleeves, hand screen printed by Robin Goodall at Wood Street Arts studios in Wakefield- Artwork designed by Nathan McGrory


Manufacturing the merchandise: £100- Limited edition prints and tote bags, hand screen printed and hand framed by professional artists.- Punk-style pin badges designed by Nathan McGrory


Capturing the album on video: £250- Working with a range of talented West Yorkshire-based filmmakers to capture spoken word videos for the Nymphs & Thugs YouTube channel 
The label has finances in place to cover the basics if needs be, but with your help, we can give this album the campaign that it deserves, and you'll get much more it.   The Impact From the moment that people see Toria perform, they're astounded at her work. Her remarkable honesty, her unflinching ability to delve far deeper than most would ever even discuss in private, and her integrity as both a writer and performer.

""These are confessional stories about love, heartbreak and addiction.  Getting them off my chest helps me to stay sane.  Some of my poetry is hard hitting and dark but there

Call it ""credit crunch poetry"" or just straight up ""punk poetry"" - in a nation in which the most vulnerable areas are strangled by poverty and agenda-driven austerity, Toria is both a shining beacon and a middle finger firmly raised.

<p><strong>Artstart Community Mural Project</strong></p>
<p><br/>Artstart is a non-profit youth arts organization that hires young artists, between the ages of 15-21, to work with professional lead artists to create public works of art for Sonoma County. Artstart is commissioned by businesses, hospitals, individuals, and municipalities to create site specific artworks.</p>
<p><br/><strong>For the Community Mural Project,  we are trying something new!</strong> We have noticed multiple empty wall spaces on buildings where the owner has given permission to create a mural, but there are no funds. By supporting a publicly funded campaign, YOU are helping to make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Help us launch this new endeavor!</strong></p>
<p>This project not only helps Artstart’s apprentices, but professional artists as well. This project will be taking art out of the conventional gallery space and into the community. This will help to beautify the area, and create more positive spaces in our city, where businesses and community will grow.</p>
<p><br/>Our inaugural artists are Erik Burke and Julia Davis. Erik is an internationally known mural artist, who has painted on walls from Brazil to Miami to his hometown of Reno. He will be painting a mural along the train tracks on the side of the buidling located at 2nd Third Street in Santa Rosa.</p>
<p><img alt=""The Blank Wall Erik will work on"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i255.photobucket.com/albums/hh127/art_start/ArtstartMuralProject-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Julia Davis is a local artist who has painted murals in Portland, Vancouver and just finished a mural on the side of Brotherhood Skate Shop in Santa Rosa. She will be painting a mural on the side of Mekong Market, located at 206 Sebastopol Ave in Santa Rosa.</p>
<p><img alt=""Mekong Market Wall"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i255.photobucket.com/albums/hh127/art_start/-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Both of them bring a unique, vibrant and beautiful style to their work, and we are very excited about what they will create!</p>
<p><br/><strong>Also, if we raise more money, then we paint more murals!!  </strong></p>

<p><br/><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p><br/>For these two murals we are hoping to raise $5,500. That sum will help pay the lead artists, as well as the young apprentices working with them. The rest of the money goes towards supplies and Artstart. With any luck we will raise more than we need, which means we will be ready to paint more murals!</p>
<p><br/> We are printing up unique stickers and t-shirts with drawings by the artists as a perk for your donation of $25 and $60. At the $100 donation we are throwing a Mural Celebration party, here at Artstart, sometime in late summer. Both artists will be present to discuss their work, and we will have appetizers by local chef Gerard, of Gerard's Paella. There will be wine and beer and live music.<br/> <br/><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

Julia Davis is a local artist who has painted murals in Portland, Vancouver and just finished a mural on the side of Brotherhood Skate Shop in Santa Rosa. She will be painting a mural on the side of Mekong Market, located at 206 Sebastopol Ave in Santa Rosa.

Both of them bring a unique, vibrant and beautiful style to their work, and we are very excited about what they will create!
Also, if we raise more money, then we paint more murals!!  
For more information on the artists please visit their websites:

What We Need & What You Get
For these two murals we are hoping to raise $5,500. That sum will help pay the lead artists, as well as the young apprentices working with them. The rest of the money goes towards supplies and Artstart. With any luck we will raise more than we need, which means we will be ready to paint more murals!
 We are printing up unique stickers and t-shirts with drawings by the artists as a perk for your donation of $25 and $60. At the $100 donation we are throwing a Mural Celebration party, here at Artstart, sometime in late summer. Both artists will be present to discuss their work, and we will have appetizers by local chef Gerard, of Gerard's Paella. There will be wine and beer and live music. Other Ways You Can Help

<p>Hi, My name is Kyla Bourgh and I am crowd funding for my
exhibition that is running from April 11th- May 2nd <sup></sup>at the Gam
Gallery in Vancouver BC. Canada.</p>
<p>Last summer, I was invited to an artist in residence program
in Zurich, Switzerland to a creative community called Zitrone. While there, I was inspired by
the wonderful, forward-thinking people who are dedicated to running this space.
For my exhibition, I returned to Zurich, to examine the innovative and constructive use of
a building that would otherwise stand empty.</p>
<p>I spent three months
working with a photographer from Zurich documenting the four-story building and
interviewing the people who are integral to running and maintaining the space.
It is not subsidized by any organization but is run by the people who work in
it.</p>
<p>My exhibition is a visual narrative that will introduce the
overall concept of how Zitrone is run and how it can benefit other artistic
communities.</p>
<p>I have been a practicing artist for the past 12 years
focusing mainly on painting and poetry. 
It became apparent while on this journey that my strongest passion is
connecting communities and people and sharing solutions.  </p>
<p>The next 2-3 weeks will be the most crucial time and where I
need the most support for the production of my exhibition.  I will be using my
fundraising to cover the costs of equipment needed, supplies, and to
contribute to some of the expenses of my journey . I went back to Zurich as a leap of
faith to create this exhibition as well as to grow as an artist. <br/></p>

Hi, My name is Kyla Bourgh and I am crowd funding for my
exhibition that is running from April 11th- May 2nd at the Gam
Gallery in Vancouver BC. Canada.
Last summer, I was invited to an artist in residence program
in Zurich, Switzerland to a creative community called Zitrone. While there, I was inspired by
the wonderful, forward-thinking people who are dedicated to running this space.
For my exhibition, I returned to Zurich, to examine the innovative and constructive use of
a building that would otherwise stand empty.
I spent three months
working with a photographer from Zurich documenting the four-story building and
interviewing the people who are integral to running and maintaining the space.
It is not subsidized by any organization but is run by the people who work in
it.
My exhibition is a visual narrative that will introduce the
overall concept of how Zitrone is run and how it can benefit other artistic
communities.
I have been a practicing artist for the past 12 years
focusing mainly on painting and poetry. 
It became apparent while on this journey that my strongest passion is

The next 2-3 weeks will be the most crucial time and where I
need the most support for the production of my exhibition.  I will be using my
fundraising to cover the costs of equipment needed, supplies, and to

I hope that this campaign will support the completion of my
project and in return there are many exciting perks.
I want to thank- you for your time and contributions.  I hope to see you at my exhibition.

We will take this tiny version of you to see all the landmarks we see. At least two photos will be taken showing your tiny self enjoying Norway, Wales and places beyond. Don't worry they will be flattering. Want to send your dog? We want you to too! Any subject allowed. We will document your wee adventure and email these to you when we get back. We will also post them to our facebook page and they will be included in our upcoming show at SoA Gallery, You will also get...wait for it...the TINY YOU. We'll send you back to yourself all fresh from travels.



Somebody's watching me
This perk gets you a googly eyed creature born of a foreign land. We will grab an ordinary object found on our travels and add one of the best accessories, Googly Eyes. We will send you a photo and mail the creature to you all from across the world. A whimsical and a great addition to your family can be yours. We will make every effort to find something that screams out your name.



Mini Masterpiece

Everyone likes original artwork. Well, everyone we like likes original artwork. We love to create and inspiration is all around us. Whether an animal at the zoo, an interesting building, a beautiful sculpture or that waiter at the local restaurant, if you choose this perk we will draw and paint a custom 4 x 6 watercolor inspired by our surroundings and mail it to you while on our trip. Foreign postmarks and stamps along with a special thank you from us included. We will take photos of the work but should you want your piece on display you may bring it on down to the gallery and we'll include the original.






  

Magical Monument
Would you love to stumble across something extraordinary and beautiful when you least expect it? In this perk you can make that happen...for someone else. This is a perk of sharing in the best way possible. We will create a scene with you in mind using objects found in the surrounding area. It may be in a forest, a parking lot, a shopping center or a front yard. It might be on the coast or left in a restroom or on the side of the street. Whatever we create we will leave it behind for others to discover and enjoy. We'll take a photo for you and allow you to title the piece either before as an inspiration for us or after as a reflection of the work created. 



Finding 50
Do you love those really interesting photo studies where the photographer catches the most interesting things? So do we! With this perk we will do it 50 times over. With your purchase you can be the instigator. 50 different dogs, 50 different women, 50 different men, 50 different trees, 50 different pubs, 50 different meals, you get the picture (literally). This project will start at the airport in the good old US of A and continue to Norway and England and Wales and perhaps beyond. Each set will be unique to you and your name will be included in the final project. These will be exhibited at SoA Gallery and posted to our facebook page.



Other Ways You Can Help
 We understand if you can't help but certainly thank you for reading this far and giving us the chance. Think back...did any of it make you laugh? Did you wish you could do it? Did you think so-and-so would love that?? If yes then PLEASE share. We want a wide slice of life to be included in our story, the more the merrier and welcome any shares and forwarding you are willing to provide. We hope you'll take a moment to mention us on Facebook, twitter, Tumblr and all the rest. Especially to your friends with dollars burning holes in thier pockets. :)",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The artists will journey into the art villages on the outskirts of Ghana. Various artisans including painters, sculptors, and weavers will be gathered in their workshops to create and collaborate. We will fellowship with the artists and students, visit their workshops to share technique, and explore the creative process, while exchanging our creative ideas with the artisans in the region.

<h2>Come Discover the Musical Intervals with Us and Austin, TX</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pythagoras (and Austinites) Discovering Musical Intervals</li>
<li>Flex Space Gallery at Pump Project</li>
<li>Austin, TX</li>
<li>September 7-16, 2012</li>
<li>Opening Night Reception: Friday, September 7, 2012</li>
</ul>
<p>We are Jessica Nixon and Andy Tang from Orchestrated Occurrences, a new collaborative art partnership in Austin, TX. Our funding campaign is raising money for an Austin community art event based on the story of Pythagoras discovering the perfect musical intervals. Pythagoras heard by chance the sounds of hammers striking an anvil at a smithy, which corresponded to the same intervals he had been studying.</p>
<p>Pythagoras's discovery and the icon of the musical blacksmith have been familiar tropes in history since Ancient Rome and Greece, referenced in literary, musical, and visual arts. Modern scholars, though, have deemed the story as a fabrication and a legend, with the most recent unique interpretation from the 1600s. Our community event to showcase showcasing Austin-area artists' interpretations of the story will be the first update in 400 years. It is truly an historic event, and we want Austinites to discover the musical intervals with us.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The cost of this 10-day event is for the gallery space, the opening and closing reception; and for the materials of the sound installations we're building to let people play the intervals:</p>
<ul>
<li>gallery space; renting pavillion tent(s), tables, chairs for reception</li>
<li>performers singing a Renaissance piece based on the intervals</li>
<li>PA and sound equipment rental</li>
<li>wood, sheet metal, wire, glass, PVC pipe tubes, string, rope</li>
<li>screws, nails, glue, duct tape, paint, paintbrushes</li>
</ul>
<p>Perks include buttons and stickers, fabric patches, pieces of our sound installations, silk-screened posters, and other commemorative items!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>The most recent major interpretation about Pythagoras's discovery was by Marin Mersenne, a French scholar in the 1600s! Since then, new, unique interpretations have been stagnant, until now. . .</li>
<li>This community event is a historic that lets the city of Austin discover the intervals and interpret the story for itself.</li>
<li>The sound demonstrations we're building allow people to play the intervals, and to hear the familiarity of these sounds to the music they hear everyday!</li>
<li>We are inviting Austin-area artists to create a multisensory and interactive experience in their creations based on the story.</li>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Tom Baskeyfield, I am a student on the MA Art and Environment course at University College Falmouth, Cornwall, UK. I moved down to Cornwall from Macclesfield in Cheshire with my wife and our cat Haruki last September; I will be graduating from the course this September. Stemming from the 'Land Art' movement in the 60s and 70s the course seeks to position art in the real world. To move away from art for arts sake toward art for all's sake. We focus on ecological thinking and art as an ecological practice.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For my MA project I have been working with a field. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i982.photobucket.com/albums/ae304/tombaskeyfield/Of%20Time%20in%20a%20Field/Book3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>

<p><b>The Field / Why a Field?</b></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: 800;""><br/></span></p>
<p>Sitting on the banks of the Penryn River, 'Little Beach' as it is known, is an old arable field. Barley grows from its soil at present, gleaming yellow; one month to go until harvest. But when I first set foot on its soil, chunky brown earth is all there was. How it has changed over these few months. It is a small field, just under three acres, but it is clearly old, perhaps ancient. Crumbling Cornish hedges and tall oaks separate it from the adjoining land. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i982.photobucket.com/albums/ae304/tombaskeyfield/Of%20Time%20in%20a%20Field/Book6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have spent the last ten months going to this field. The exposed earth and welcoming space attracted me to it at first, but a deeper desire to be there came from an interest in the land and our relationship to it. Fields are synonymous with the British landscape and they are integral to our lives yet they are perhaps somewhat over looked. What actually happens in a field over the course of a year? What lives live out and narratives present themselves? What can we learn about ourselves and the way we live today through consciously spending sustained time in one place?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i982.photobucket.com/albums/ae304/tombaskeyfield/Of%20Time%20in%20a%20Field/Book10.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Through my time with Little Beach I have seen it transform from a sodden, chunky orangey-brown expanse of space to a churned up medley of soil and stone, to a brown desert dotted with a carpet of young green shoots of barley, to an almost impenetrable thatching of coarse mature plants in their last few weeks before harvest. I have sat in the rain, in the freezing temperatures of last winter and in the burning sun of this summer contemplating this place and its place, and many others like it, in the lives of us all. At times I have wondered what I was doing there, why was I standing there as rain tumbled from my head to the sodden mud under my feet, at others I found myself in ore of the place existing at all, that this was the link to our past, to settlement and sustainable life. And beyond the soil and stone, hedgerows and crops the field is also about the birds, insects, rabbits and other creatures that call it home, whose lives it also sustains. </p>

<p><b>My Art - How Have I Responded to The Field?</b></p>

<p>Through the ten months that I have worked with Little Beach I have approached its many faces in a number of ways.

Hello, my name is Tom Baskeyfield, I am a student on the MA Art and Environment course at University College Falmouth, Cornwall, UK. I moved down to Cornwall from Macclesfield in Cheshire with my wife and our cat Haruki last September; I will be graduating from the course this September. Stemming from the 'Land Art' movement in the 60s and 70s the course seeks to position art in the real world. To move away from art for arts sake toward art for all's sake. We focus on ecological thinking and art as an ecological practice.

For my MA project I have been working with a field. 



(This and all following images with accompanying text are from the design layout of 'Of Time in a Field')

The Field / Why a Field?

Sitting on the banks of the Penryn River, 'Little Beach' as it is known, is an old arable field. Barley grows from its soil at present, gleaming yellow; one month to go until harvest. But when I first set foot on its soil, chunky brown earth is all there was. How it has changed over these few months.

Fields are synonymous with the British landscape and they are integral to our lives yet they are perhaps somewhat over looked. What actually happens in a field over the course of a year? What lives live out and narratives present themselves? What can we learn about ourselves and the way we live today through consciously spending sustained time in one place?



Through my time with Little Beach I have seen it transform from a sodden, chunky orangey-brown expanse of space to a churned up medley of soil and stone, to a brown desert dotted with a carpet of young green shoots of barley, to an almost impenetrable thatching of coarse mature plants in their last few weeks before harvest.

At times I have wondered what I was doing there, why was I standing there as rain tumbled from my head to the sodden mud under my feet, at others I found myself in ore of the place existing at all, that this was the link to our past, to settlement and sustainable life. And beyond the soil and stone, hedgerows and crops the field is also about the birds, insects, rabbits and other creatures that call it home, whose lives it also sustains. 



My Art - How Have I Responded to The Field?

Through the ten months that I have worked with Little Beach I have approached its many faces in a number of ways. Walking, writing, photography and video are the main methods that make up my artistic practice. Earlier in the year I set up a blog to host my writing and photography about Little Beach.

I have also created an online portfolio which contains more photographs and a film I made this year called Contemplating the Birth of a Field. You can see that here: www.tombaskeyfield.carbonmade.com



So why Have I set up This Campaign?

As a record of my time in the field, and as a way of presenting and sharing my experiences with others I am in the process of compiling my writing and photography into a book - Of Time in a Field. The book will be around 160 pages long, black and white with full colour front cover, paper back, 5"" x 8"" approx. I would like to print a very limited run of 100 books and this is where I'd like to share the project with you. To print 100 books I need £440 ($720) this I don't have. So I'm putting the idea out to you that if you are interested in what I have talked about above and would like to see the project come to fruition I am asking for you to pre-order a copy to make it happen. 

There will be 70 of the 100 books available for pre-order through this campaign as I would like to have a few available for the MA exhibition, and also, I intend to place at least 5 in public libraries in the local area and in the main library in my hometown, Macclesfield. I feel the real essence of the land is in community and I wish to share my experiences with the communities in which I'm part of.  


  
How it will work? What will you Receive for your role in the project?


There are three ways that you can contribute to the project. For £5 ($8)  you will receive a mounted and signed photograph taken by me over the past ten months in the field.  For £12 ($20) you will receive the above and a numbered copy of the book. For £15 ($24) you will receive the above and in addition the book will also be signed and your name will be printed inside as a thank you for your contribution. All contributions include postage and packaging to wherever you are in the world.

What if we don't raise enough?

If we don't raise the full amount, not to worry. I still intend to print 100 copies of the book, but I will do this in smaller quantities over a longer period of time. Of course everyone who has  contributed will receive their book, etc, as soon as the campaign has ended. I will keep you well informed.

<p><b>The
Project</b></p>
<p>In the beginning of 2012, photographer Thomas Kellner received a surprising
E-Mail from Yekaterinburg in the Russian Urals, to form a project with
exhibition and book for the city’s anniversary in 2013, because Yekaterinburg
was founded almost 300 years ago, by Georg Wilhem Henning, a Siegen Citizen.
This was barely known and Thomas Kellner started his research and is now
finalizing genius loci.</p>

<h3></h3>During the years of study Thomas Kellner began to work with pinhole cameras in the subject of art which built the basis for his approach he is following to the present day. In his early works experimenting with material, photographic methods and contents was crucial. It included building pinhole cameras himself in order to adopt them to the purpose he was aiming at. <br/>The results reflect a diversity of styles and subjects. They range from multiple perspectives within one photograph over documentary to photograms. In this period he always printed full editions so that today there is a large number of a vintage print for later exhibitions. <br/><br/>At the end of the nineties then Thomas focused on the analogue camera and 35 mm film. He developed a visual language and method that deconstructs and constructs objects at the same time. <br/>Now, since already 15 years, he is working in a worldwide unique style of contactsheets, photographing the object in numerous singular shots until in the end the object is visible in its entirety again. The film-material Thomas is using is transparent for the recipient as well because the single shots are assembled together as negatives. Therefore perforation, codification and numbers of the film-material are part of the positive. <br/><br/><i>“What I was viewing was not a single photograph but an entire orchestration of shots, with the format of the contact sheet serving to freeze and destabilize these atomistic particles at the same time.”<br/>Kellner, T., Wendorf, R., 2008.

<p></p>In 2013 Thomas Kellner photographed important companies and establishments in Siegerland and South-Westphalia in Germany and went several times to Russia to take pictures there from chosen regions and their industrial architecture. <br/>These photographs will be published in the book “genius loci” to show the heretofore little-known connection between Siegen and the Russian Urals as well as the beauty of the respective industrial cultures. In the size of 12 x 10 inches and with approximately 120 pages the photo-book will tell us new and interesting facts about the industrial history of Siegen, the life of its native citizen Georg Wilhelm Henning and the work of Thomas Kellner as an artist. Approximately 30 images will portray the industrially important enterprises as representatives of their regions to show their connection to steel and metal. <br/>Thomas Kellner is looking forward to familiarize the two regions, Siegen and the Russian Urals, with each other through this project both, economically and culturally, and to call the “genius loci” alias Georg Wilhelm Henning to mind.  <br/>Thank you for your help making this book possible. <br/><br/><b><i>Book Details</i></b><br/><br/>Text: Essay by Artjem Berkovich, Dr. Andreas Bingener, Dr. Irina Chmyreva<br/>Design: Marc Babenschneider, inspirit - graphicbureau<br/>Photographs: approx. 30 in color <br/>Size: approx. 12 x 10 inches <br/>Retail price: 39.80 Euro<br/>Publication date: 22 November 2013<br/>Publisher: seltmann+söhne<br/><p></p>

In 2013 Thomas Kellner photographed important companies and establishments in Siegerland and South-Westphalia in Germany and went several times to Russia to take pictures there from chosen regions and their industrial architecture. These photographs will be published in the book “genius loci” to show the heretofore little-known connection between Siegen and the Russian Urals as well as the beauty of the respective industrial cultures. In the size of 12 x 10 inches and with approximately 120 pages the photo-book will tell us new and interesting facts about the industrial history of Siegen, the life of its native citizen Georg Wilhelm Henning and the work of Thomas Kellner as an artist. Approximately 30 images will portray the industrially important enterprises as representatives of their regions to show their connection to steel and metal. Thomas Kellner is looking forward to familiarize the two regions, Siegen and the Russian Urals, with each other through this project both, economically and culturally, and to call the “genius loci” alias Georg Wilhelm Henning to mind.  Thank you for your help making this book possible.

<h2><strong>Miles &amp; Coltrane: Blue (.) by Concrete Generation</strong></h2>
<p><em>captures the energy of the 1950's, an era when America was rapidly changing. Jazz was the soundtrack of this era, and at the forefront of jazz music was trumpet blaring Miles Davis; and skillful saxophonist John Coltrane.

<p><em>Like Jazz, this stage production provides a unique experience each time and has ""something new, always.” It is journey, through the lives of two of the most influential and controversial figures in jazz. Guided by award winning poets, musicians, dancers, and actors; we explore how they changed music and left a powerful legacy of jazz.</em></p>
