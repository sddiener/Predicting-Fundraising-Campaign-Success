THE ICE STUPA ARTIFICIAL GLACIER PROJECTThis is our latest invention…  a very simple technique of freezing the unused stream water in winter into huge cones (stupas) of ice that then melt slowly into late spring providing water for trees and farms.Some of you might remember that to make the pilot Ice stupas in Phyang we ran a successful crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.

<p><strong>Sinagua Malt: Market Based River Conservation</strong></p>
<p>Sinagua Malt is a unique opportunity to create a source of locally grown and processed malt barley while improving flows in the Verde River.  Why?</p>
<p>There is not a malting facility in Arizona – therefore malt for local beer all comes from out of state – not local.  Barley is a low water use crop – growing it in the Verde Valley can improve streamflow.  Sinagua Malt provides benefits to beer drinkers, farmers and river lovers!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Sinagua Malt has worked to secure private investment to purchase malting equipment and secure a location in Camp Verde Arizona.  Through this campaign we are seeking to secure 2017 operating costs – this include initial purchase of grain, hiring a malt master and getting the doors open.</p>
<p>Help us raise this last $100,000 to ensure that malt is ready for beer by October this year!  Check out our great perks - or just contribute what you can!  </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Sinagua Malt is one of many projects that are taking place to restore and protect the Verde River and to protecting local agriculture.  This is a unique opportunity for you to engage in these important issues that affect Arizona.  But this concept is not just limited to Arizona – once successful this type of work can be implemented in other areas where development of a local market can drive conservation and support the local economy.</p>
<p>Sinagua Malt has partnered with Hauser and Hauser Farms and The Nature Conservancy to develop this collaborative solution.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

This includes <u><i>crowdsourced recipes</i></u>, so that the food you cook at home can be just as impactful as the food you get on the go. We’ll also be able to invest in creating a <u><i>smarter search</i></u> which allows you to say things like <i>‘Show me meals nearby with mushrooms and artichokes under $10’</i>, or <i>‘What can I cook that includes olive oil, broccoli and zucchinis’.</i> We’ll also add social features like the ability to <u><i>share your impact reports with friends</i></u>, so you can motivate each other to keep up the good work. </p><h3>$2,000,000+ </h3><p><strong>Change the way we choose food.</strong> We grow sustainly, add innovative new features and market it on a wide scale and accelerate the impact of the platform.

We are committed to developing new waste management solutions that can help in achieving its green goals. We are strongly committed to promoting recycle and reuse.

Shayna EcoUnified, developed as part of the fast-track translational project has incorporated useful waste plastic matrix in its process which is further transformed into structural tiles.</p><p><strong>EcoUnifying Value</strong></p><p><strong>Plastic bags and bottles are the most widespread forms of litter.</strong> It is safe to assume that plastic bags are somewhere necessitating a mindfulness of ecological sustainability. With numerous measures being adopted by several nations, plastic bags continue to be a part of our ecosystem further forcing us to reconsider the measures adopted to stop the plastic bags transaction. Recycling is an old norm pursued by many companies but an intelligent conversion of the latter is still far from being achieved or even thought upon.</p><p>Recycling is an approach which is decided and applied on a community by a community. <strong>At present many companies are working towards a “single stream” recycling cycle which means that the hard plastic items are being considered and softer plastic materials like plastic bags never experience the recycle process. </strong>Plastic bags, created in infinite numbers, used by nearly every individual are responsible for generating 50% of water pollution and 70% of air pollution.</p><p><strong>Shanya Ecounified, a company driven with an achievable, intelligent and sustainable goal has recognized the disconnect in the present recycling scenario. </strong>Working towards a goal of creating a greener footprint, Shanya has created a much required and logical wealth from waste.</p><p><strong>Uniqueness of our product</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506801058/g6zurzv3aculnmmd1vln.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>It has several advantages over cement &amp; cermaic tiles and to be ready to use without drying is one of them. </strong></p><p>Application of the tiles:</p><p>We have drawn importance from waste which continues to corrupt the natural habitat of the planet further fracturing the health of many. Here’s a look at the optimum applications of floor tiles created out of plastic waste:</p><p><strong>• Roof tiles • Interlocking tiles • Floor tiles • Pavement tiles • Wall tiles • Building Structures  like public toilets, shelter homes, health centres &amp; dispensaries, park benches etc.  </strong></p><p><strong>Remarkably, the tiles can also be further recycled and reused for other structural designs.</strong></p><p><strong>The Technology </strong></p><p>(CSIR-NPL) has developed a technology that provides a solution to solid waste management and promotes a waste to energy program, which is urgently required in our country’s recycling industry. Plastic recycling is the process of recovering scrap or waste plastic and reprocessing the material into useful products. We are aiming to recycle plastic waste into plastic tiles to use for the development of our society. Making tiles from plastic takes less time for processing than cement tiles. Their weight is also less, making them easy to handle.</p><p><strong>The Process</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507122984/c1sznlupjpuh6ahst5l1.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Support</strong></p><p>The team is currently seeking funding to set up a full- fledged production unit and to generate pre-orders for the plastic waste tiles. We have invested a significant amount in buying the license from CSIR for using the technology and now looking for support which can be helpful in further funding this unique “Clean and Green” initiative of ours where we are not only going to put plastic waste to good use but also employ solar power to manufacture the tiles instead of using electricity. </p><p>Our team is in need of financial support in setting up the plastic tile manufacturing unit. We have worked out on a budget of approx $ 1,94,766 to buy equipment and start the manufacturing process.

</tbody></table></div>","About the Company Shayna EcoUnified India Pvt. Ltd. is a team of young entrepreneurs with significant knowledge in the field of plastic waste management. We are committed to developing new waste management solutions that can help in achieving its green goals. We are strongly committed to promoting recycle and reuse. We aim at providing solutions that go far beyond simply taking the rubbish away. We have a clear understanding of the importance of our role in managing the waste we all generate. We are looking at the future of waste management, and we have a plan.We are the first holder of Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR)-National Physical Laboratory’s (NPL) technology and registered under Ministry of Commerce & Industry in its continuous efforts has unified its conventional techniques and resources to reduce environmental pollution. Shayna EcoUnified, developed as part of the fast-track translational project has incorporated useful waste plastic matrix in its process which is further transformed into structural tiles.EcoUnifying ValuePlastic bags and bottles are the most widespread forms of litter. It is safe to assume that plastic bags are somewhere necessitating a mindfulness of ecological sustainability. With numerous measures being adopted by several nations, plastic bags continue to be a part of our ecosystem further forcing us to reconsider the measures adopted to stop the plastic bags transaction. Recycling is an old norm pursued by many companies but an intelligent conversion of the latter is still far from being achieved or even thought upon.Recycling is an approach which is decided and applied on a community by a community. At present many companies are working towards a “single stream” recycling cycle which means that the hard plastic items are being considered and softer plastic materials like plastic bags never experience the recycle process. Plastic bags, created in infinite numbers, used by nearly every individual are responsible for generating 50% of water pollution and 70% of air pollution.Shanya Ecounified, a company driven with an achievable, intelligent and sustainable goal has recognized the disconnect in the present recycling scenario. Working towards a goal of creating a greener footprint, Shanya has created a much required and logical wealth from waste.Uniqueness of our productIt has several advantages over cement & cermaic tiles and to be ready to use without drying is one of them. Application of the tiles:We have drawn importance from waste which continues to corrupt the natural habitat of the planet further fracturing the health of many. Here’s a look at the optimum applications of floor tiles created out of plastic waste:• Roof tiles • Interlocking tiles • Floor tiles • Pavement tiles • Wall tiles • Building Structures  like public toilets, shelter homes, health centres & dispensaries, park benches etc.  Remarkably, the tiles can also be further recycled and reused for other structural designs.The Technology (CSIR-NPL) has developed a technology that provides a solution to solid waste management and promotes a waste to energy program, which is urgently required in our country’s recycling industry. Plastic recycling is the process of recovering scrap or waste plastic and reprocessing the material into useful products. We are aiming to recycle plastic waste into plastic tiles to use for the development of our society. Making tiles from plastic takes less time for processing than cement tiles. Their weight is also less, making them easy to handle.The ProcessSupportThe team is currently seeking funding to set up a full- fledged production unit and to generate pre-orders for the plastic waste tiles. We have invested a significant amount in buying the license from CSIR for using the technology and now looking for support which can be helpful in further funding this unique “Clean and Green” initiative of ours where we are not only going to put plastic waste to good use but also employ solar power to manufacture the tiles instead of using electricity. Our team is in need of financial support in setting up the plastic tile manufacturing unit. We have worked out on a budget of approx $ 1,94,766 to buy equipment and start the manufacturing process. To secure funds, we have applied under several Start Up schemes announced by the Indian government and are awaiting response.Cost breakdown

I am excited to tell you something about how this whole project started.</p><p>Environmental issues and climate change have always been a worrying factor to me. However, I also felt that the problems seemed so overwhelming big that I thought that I as an individual couldn’t really do anything about it. I think a lot of people feel the same impotence when we talk about environmental issues. We know about the general problem and we rather get upset with big contaminating companies than that we change something to our own daily habits. I have realised that change really does start by ourselves and that’s why I want to inspire as much people around the world as possible and let them feel that change is needed and that it all starts with changing our own habits. I want to do this by crossing Latin America in a sustainable vehicle. I will visit schools along the way to do my project and explain them why this is so important. I already started giving workshops and talks at schools in South America accompanied by movies about environmental subjects and I see the big impact this has on those kids. I think that even though nowadays where we live in a society where obtaining information became very easy for everybody it is still very important or even more important to physically visit people and bring the information to them. I think this way you can have a real impact on them showing what's happening with our planet and teach them the existing alternatives to live a more sustainable life. The sustainable vehicle with all the products and objects I use to be able to live on zero waste, is a great live example and will make it easier to teach them how to apply this on their own lives. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What I need and how I thank you for your support</strong></p><p>To make this project successful I will need to make a fully sustainable vehicle. this will cost me around 20.000 euro's. Apart from that I want to show movies with a mobile cinema. Therefore I will need equipment, which will cost me around 2.000 euros. To make the documentary about the whole trip and to keep you all updated with videos and tutorials I will need to buy film equipment like cameras lenses and hard disks this will cost me around 3.000 euro's. In total I will need 25.000 euro’s to be able to start the project.</p><p>How will I thank you for your support? First of all I think it is important to say that the main goal of this project is to spread the word about environmental issues with a real life example of the sustainable driving bus (with sustainable working products in it) and the mobile cinema in combination with the workshops and talks. Helping me with this project means that you are helping the world a step forward to make of it a better one! You can donate whatever amount you want and you can choose to get a CD with songs sung by me especially made for this project where you can listen to songs from countries that I will be visiting during my trip. If you sell or produce a product that has to do with sustainable living and you are interested in promotion of it, there is also the possibility to donate a product and I will make promotion for it during my trip by showing it and by sticking the name of the brand on the back of my vehicle.</p><p><strong>€​15&gt; </strong>Digital Thank You! To show my thanks, I will send you a special thank you note and you get a colouring picture of the project. (download file)</p><p><strong>€​30&gt; </strong>I will send you a digital song sung by me with ‘Dúo Tódo’ </p><p><strong>€​50&gt;  </strong>I sent you my CD with music from countries I will be visiting during the project in Latin-America. sung by me especially made for this project.</p><p><strong>€​100&gt; </strong>Get free access to watch the documentary that I will make about the whole trip. (available after the whole project is finished)</p><p><strong>€​1000&gt; </strong>This is such a big help to my project! If time and place coincide I will perform live for you and sing you some songs! We can also have contact to see if there is other ways how I can thank you for such a big help! </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>When is my donation going to be used?</strong></p><p>Before this whole project starts I will be in brasil, Holland and Spain for a while. I start to build the vehicle from September/October 2018 in California and when it’s ready I start driving. The exact date I start driving is difficult to tell because it will depend a lot on how easy it is to convert the vehicle into a totally sustainable one.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What if I don't reach the entire amount of financial support?</strong></p><p>If I don’t reach my entire goal with this crowdfunding campaign it doesn’t mean that this project is not going to happen. I will definitely do everything to make this project a success so I will keep searching for funding and apart from that I will work as much as possible to be able to start in September/October 2018.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The impact</strong></p><p>Your contribution whether it’s big or small will help me and the planet enormously. In the direct form it will help me to get everything ready to start the project but indirectly your contribution will help even more because it will help the thousands of people I will visit with the project to get inspired to help the planet! This means that YOU can have a tremendous impact on saving this planet just by helping my project with your contribution. </p><p>I already started in Argentina with teaching about environmental issues by projecting movies, giving workshops and talks and making music in primary and secondary schools. In one word a big success! I have been invited to talk on several local radio stations to come and talk about the project and several newspapers wrote about the success of my visits.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>There are a few things that might be challenging during this whole project. The first thing is that I am running this project alone. Even though that’s my choice I should be aware of the fact that sometimes things can go slower or that I really need help sometimes to get things done. I think this is a challenge but the enormous drive I feel inside about making a success of this project will help me to move on!</p><p>To make a vehicle 100% sustainable there is technology needed and people who are willing to help me building it. A risk would be that I don’t find the way to make a 100% sustainable vehicle. I think all the contacts I made the past 2 years will definitely help me with this challenge. In that case I will not be able to make it 100% sustainable I will make the vehicle partial sustainable with the possibility that during the trip the vehicle will become more sustainableevery time.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Other ways you can help me</strong></p><p>There are a bunch of other ways to help me and they are as valuable as money! If you sell sustainable products from whatever kind that I can promote during my trip, donating those products would be a great way of helping me. I can promote those products by showing people how I use them and by sticking your name on my vehicle! Or just help me to spread the word and share my story and campaign, talk with people about it and share it on your Facebook, twitter or Instagram with the Indiegogo share tools.</p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508423554/xohirwcwfljaqd0cenym.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Picture: Workshop making natural toothpaste </i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508424536/tesc0rk7m1swol7icfny.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>picture: giving a talk about plastic pollution on a rural school </i></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Help jij mij de wereld te inspireren? </strong></h3><p>Wat fijn dat je even de tijd neemt om mijn campagne te bekijken! Ik ben Jorien Timmers (26), afgestudeerd psychologe en sinds twee jaar reizende door verschillende landen.</p><p>Ik heb me eigenlijk van kleins af aan al bezig gehouden met milieukwesties. Ik heb me er ook op verschillende manieren voor ingezet. Ondanks de zorgen die ik me er soms over maakte, overheerste echter vaak een gevoel van onmacht, omdat de problemen zo ontzettend groot bleken te zijn, dat ik dacht: Wat kan ík hier nou eigenlijk echt aan doen? Ik denk dat veel mensen dit gevoel van onmacht wel kennen als het gaat om het oplossen van milieukwesties. We kennen het probleem, maar worden vaak boos op de grote milieuvervuilende bedrijven, zonder dat we echt eens goed bekijken wat we er zelf allemaal aan kunnen doen. Ik heb me gerealiseerd, dat verandering toch echt bij onszelf begint en dat is de aanleiding geweest voor mijn project. Ik wil zoveel mogelijk mensen over de hele wereld inspireren en laten zien, dat verandering nodig is en dat deze verandering begint bij het veranderen van onze eigen dagelijkse gewoonten. Ik ga dit doen door met een milieuvriendelijke bus en een mobiele bioscoop van Californië naar het zuiden van Argentinië te reizen. Tijdens deze reis zal ik zo min mogelijk afval produceren. Ik wil scholen, culturele centra e.d gaan bezoeken met het doel bewustzijn te creëren door middel van het tonen van films over milieu thema’s zoals het gebruik van plastic en aan de hand hiervan wil ik lezingen en workshops geven. Hierbij zal het levende voorbeeld van mijn leven met zo min mogelijk afval de milieuvriendelijke bus zijn, waarin ik producten gebruik, die zoveel mogelijk milieuvriendelijk zijn. Ik wil hiermee de mensen inspireren en vooral ook laten voelen, dat verandering nodig is en ook de mogelijkheden laten zien hoe we deze verandering kunnen aanpakken. Het feit dat er vandaag de dag zoveel informatie beschikbaar is op elk gebied, zo ook op dit gebied, wil niet zeggen, dat het ook aankomt bij mensen. Ik denk dat een fysiek persoon met een fysiek voorbeeld echt een indruk kan maken en iemand kan inspireren ook zelf aan de slag te gaan door het zien van voorbeelden over hoe te kunnen leven met minder afval.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Wat ik nodig heb voor dit project en hoe ik jou bedank?</strong></p><p>Om van dit project een succes te maken, zal ik een bus moeten kopen en ombouwen tot een milieuvriendelijke bus. Dit zal me rond de 20.000 euro gaan kosten. Daarnaast wil ik films laten zien met een mobiele milieuvriendelijke bioscoop. Hiervoor zal ik rond de 2.000 euro nodig hebben. En om van dit hele project een documentaire te maken zal ik materiaal nodig hebben zoals camera’s, lenzen en hard disks. Dit alles zal rond de 3.000 euro’s gaan kosten. In totaal zal ik dus rond de 25.000 euro nodig hebben om te kunnen starten met dit project.</p><p>Wat krijg jij? Ten eerste is het belangrijk te weten dat het hoofddoel van dit project het verspreiden van bewustwording is op het gebied van milieukwesties aan de hand van het levende voorbeeld, namelijk de milieuvriendelijke bus, die volledig milieuvriendelijk functioneert. En daarnaast met de mobiele bioscoop die mee gaat en de workshops en talks die gegeven worden. Het doneren aan mijn project betekent eigenlijk het mee helpen redden van deze planeet. Je kunt elk bedrag doneren en daarvoor ontvang je een persoonlijk bedankje in de vorm van een in eigen beheer opgenomen cd met liedjes door mijzelf gezongen van de landen die ik zal aandoen op mijn reis. Als je een verkoper of maker bent van een product, dat te maken heeft met milieuvriendelijk leven, dan is er ook de mogelijkheid een product te doneren, zodat ik dit product tijdens mijn reis promoot doormiddel van het demonstreren ervan en daarnaast door uw logo/merk op de achterkant van mijn busje te plakken.</p><p><strong>€ 15,00&gt;</strong> Digitaal bedankje met bijgevoegd een kleurplaat van het project (pdf)</p><p><strong>€ 30,00&gt;</strong> Ik stuur je een online liedje van ‘Dúo Tódo’</p><p><strong>€ 50,00 &gt;</strong> Ontvang mijn cd met liederen gezongen door mij zelf van de landen, die ik tijdens mijn reis ga bezoeken in Latijns-America.</p><p><strong>€1000 &gt;</strong> Dit is echt een geweldige bijdrage aan mijn project. Als tijd en plaats samenvallen kom ik live voor je zingen! We kunnen ook even contact opnemen over andere manieren hoe ik je zou kunnen bedanken voor deze grote bijdrage aan mijn project!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Wanneer zal mijn donatie gebruikt worden?</strong></p><p>Voordat dit hele project begint, zal ik nog een tijdje in Brazilië, Spanje en Nederland zijn. Het plan is, dat ik ga beginnen met het bouwen van het busje in september/oktober 2018 in Californië en als dat klaar is begint de reis. De exacte datum is moeilijk in te schatten, want dat zal afhangen van hoe snel het ombouwen van het busje zal gaan.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Wat als ik mijn gehele doelbedrag niet haal?</strong></p><p>Als ik mijn gehele doelbedrag niet bij elkaar krijg via de crowdfunding-actie, zal dit niet betekenen dat het niet doorgaat. Ik ga er alles aan doen om van dit project een succes te maken en ik zal daarom door blijven gaan met financiële steun zoeken en daarnaast zal ik zo veel mogelijk gaan werken, zodat ik weg kan gaan op de streefdatum, namelijk september 2018.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Impact </strong></p><p>Jouw bijdrage, al is het klein of groot, kan dit project en deze planeet een hele grote stap vooruit helpen. Direct zal het mij helpen om alles voor te bereiden en in orde te maken en te vertrekken, maar indirect zal jou bijdrage nog veel meer invloed hebben. Het zal het namelijk mogelijk maken alle mensen die ik op mijn reis tegenkom te inspireren bewuster met deze planeet om te gaan door hun gewoonten te veranderen. Dit betekent dat JIJ een enorme impact kan hebben op het redden van deze planeet alleen al door het doneren van geld.</p><p>Ik ben in Argentinië al gestart met lesgeven over milieu-issues door middel van films en presentaties en door het geven van workshops en het maken van muziek op scholen. In één woord een groot succes. Ik ben daarnaast gevraagd op verschillende lokale radiostations om mijn verhaal te doen en verschillende kranten hebben artikelen geschreven, over het succes van mijn project op scholen.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Risico’s en uitdagingen</strong></p><p>Er zijn een aantal uitdagingen aan dit project. De eerste is het feit dat ik dit project zelf run. Ook al is dit mijn bewuste keuze, het zal niet altijd makkelijk zijn en sommige dingen zullen daardoor langzamer gaan dan gewild en ik zal soms hulp moeten vragen aan derden. Dit is een echte uitdaging, maar ik denk dat de enorme drive die ik voel om door te zetten met dit project, me hierin enorm zal helpen!</p><p>Om het busje 100% milieuvriendelijk te maken is er technologie nodig en zijn er mensen nodig die bereid zijn te helpen het busje zo milieuvriendelijk mogelijk om te bouwen. Een risico is, dat ik niet de perfecte manier vind om het busje totaal milieuvriendelijk te krijgen. Ik denk dat de contacten, die ik de afgelopen 2 jaar gemaakt heb, zeker helpen bij deze uitdaging. Indien het toch lastig wordt het busje volledig milieuvriendelijk te maken, zal hij gedeeltelijk milieuvriendelijk gemaakt worden met de mogelijkheid hem onderweg steeds milieuvriendelijker te laten rijden.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Andere manieren waarop je me kunt helpen?</strong></p><p>Er zijn vele manieren waarop je me zou kunnen helpen en deze zijn net zo waardevol als geld! Als je milieubewuste/vriendelijke producten verkoopt of maakt van wat voor soort dan ook, dan kan ik daar reclame voor maken tijdens mijn reis. Het doneren van deze producten geeft mij de mogelijkheid deze producten te gebruiken in mijn busje en te laten zien aan anderen hoe ze werken. Daarnaast kan ik een sticker van het merk achter op de bus plakken. Of je kunt helpen mijn campagne te delen op Facebook, twitter en Instagram met de Indiegogo share tool. Of gewoon van mond op mond.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508423685/cbnu3anwczrkwa7rvmqj.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>picture: giving a talk about plastic pollution on a secondary school, Argentina</i></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508424673/ls8gtzzicedlixqekvum.png"" src=""""/></h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>picture: Visiting a school in rural village in Argentina showing movies about environmental problems</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>¿Me ayudas a inspirar al mundo?</strong></h3><p>¡Gracias por tomar tu tiempo para leer y seguir mi campaña! Soy Jorien Timmers (26) de Holanda, psicóloga recibida y actualmente vivo viajando por el mundo. Con mucho gusto les cuento cómo empezó todo este proyecto.</p><p>El cambio climático y los problemas ambientales siempre han sido un factor preocupante para mí. Sin embargo, me parecían tan grandes que sentí que yo, como individuo, no podía hacer tanto al respecto. Creo que nos pasa a muchos de nosotros el sentimiento de impotencia cuando hablamos de temas medio ambientales. Conocemos el problema general y preferimos quejarnos sobre las grandes empresas contaminantes, en vez de enfocarnos en lo que nosotros mismos diariamente podemos hacer al respecto por ejemplo al cambiar nuestros hábitos. Me di cuenta que el cambio realmente comienza por nosotros mismos y es por eso que quiero inspirar a las personas de todo el mundo y hacerles sentir que se necesita un cambio y que ellos mismos pueden tener mucha influencia en ese cambio.</p><p>El proyecto que quiero comenzar es el siguiente: Quiero cruzar América Latina en un vehículo sustentable. Llevando un cine móvil y dando talleres y charlas sobre temas medio ambientales. Durante el viaje vivo sin producir basura. Visitaré entre ellas, escuelas y centros culturales. Ya empecé a dar talleres y charlas en escuelas en Latino América, y veo el gran impacto que tiene en los niños y adultos. Creo que a pesar de que hoy en día vivimos en una época en la que obtener información resulta muy fácil para todos, no es de menor importancia visitar físicamente a las personas para acercarles la información, y de esta manera, puede tener un impacto real en ellos, mostrando lo que está sucediendo con nuestro planeta y brindando alternativas diversas para vivir una vida con mayor conciencia. El vehículo sustentable en el que me trasladaré por Latino América, será de gran ejemplo vivo, ya que uno de objetivos primordiales del viaje será vivir sin generar basura y hará que sea más fácil enseñar cómo aplicar esto en la vida de las personas que sean atravesadas por este viaje.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Que necesito y como te agradezco la ayuda?</strong></p><p>Para dar el punta pie inicial a este proyecto, tendré que adaptar un vehículo para convertirlo completamente a sustentable. Esto me costará alrededor de 20000 euros. Aparte de eso, quiero mostrar películas a través de un cine móvil y necesitaré equipamiento, que me costará aproximadamente 2000 euros.</p><p>Para hacer ‘El documental’ de todo el viaje, necesitaré comprar equipos, como lentes, cámaras y discos duros, esto me costará alrededor de 3000 euros. En total, necesitaré 25,000 euros para poder comenzar el proyecto.</p><p>¿Cómo le agradezco? En primer lugar, creo que es importante decir que el objetivo principal de este proyecto es difundir información sobre los problemas medio ambientales que afectan nuestro planeta para generar consciencia. Ayudarme con este proyecto significa que estás ayudando al mundo y en la concientización para que las personas comiencen a cuidarlo. A cambio de tu donación, del cual tú puedes elegir la cantidad de dinero que colaboras, les envío un CD en el cual canto canciones de países de Latino America los cuales voy a visitar con mi proyecto ‘Eco Bus América’. Además, si vendes o produces un producto que tiene que ver con vivir de manera sustentable y estas interesado en promocionarlo, existe la posibilidad de donar tu producto y lo mencionaré durante mi viaje mostrándolo a la gente y pondré su logo/marca atrás en mi vehículo.</p><p><strong>€ 15,00 &gt;</strong> Para mostrarle mi agradecimiento, le enviaré un agradecimiento especial digitalmente. Te mando también una imagen para colorear del proyecto.</p><p><strong>€ 30,00 &gt;</strong> Te enviaré una canción digital cantada por mí con 'Dúo Tódo'</p><p><strong>€ 50,00 &gt;</strong> te envío mi CD con música de los países que visitaré durante el proyecto en América Latina.</p><p><strong>€ 1000 &gt;</strong> Iré a visitarte para brindarle un concierto en vivo antes, durante o después de mi viaje. Voy a tocar en vivo para ti en una fiesta que des / en un evento que tengas o en otras ocasiones. Dependiendo de la hora y el lugar, ire con o sin mi dúo  musical Guillermo Zocca. (tendremos contacto para definir las posibilidades de donde y cuando se realizara el encuentro. (Antes que comience el proyecto Eco Bus América, estaré en España, Holanda y durante mi viaje visitaré países entre California y el sur de Argentina)</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>¿Cuándo se va a usar tu donación?</strong></p><p>Antes de que todo este proyecto comience, estaré en Brasil, Holanda y España por un tiempo. Empiezo a construir el vehículo desde Septiembre/Octubre 2018 en California y cuando está listo, comienzo el viaje hacia la Patagonia. La fecha exacta en que inicio el viaje es difícil de determinar porque dependerá mucho del proceso de convertir el vehículo en uno sustentable.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>¿Qué sucede si no llego a recibir suficiente financiamiento con este crowdfunding?</strong></p><p>Si no alcanzo a recibir todo el dinero que necesitaría con esta campaña de crowdfunding, no significa que este proyecto no vaya a suceder. Haré todo para que este proyecto sea un éxito, así que seguiré buscando fondos y aparte de eso trabajaré hasta el momento de partir que será septiembre/octubre de 2018.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>El impacto</strong></p><p>Tu contribución, ya sea grande o pequeña, ayudará muchísimo al proyecto y al planeta. En la forma directa, me ayudará a preparar todo para iniciar el proyecto, pero indirectamente, su contribución ayudará aún más porque le permitirá  a miles de personas a  inspirarse para ayudar al planeta. Esto significa que TU vas a ser parte del impacto que generará el proyecto simplemente colaborando con mi proyecto.</p><p>En Argentina ya empecé a visitar escuelas dando charlas y mostrando películas sobre temas ambientales. ¡En una palabra, un éxito! Fui invitada a hablar en varias radios de diferentes localidades para hablar sobre el proyecto y varios diarios escribieron sobre el impacto de mis visitas.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Riesgos y desafíos</strong></p><p align=""left"">Hay algunas cosas que pueden ser desafiantes durante este proyecto. Primero de todo estoy haciendo este proyecto sola.

I am excited to tell you something about how this whole project started.Environmental issues and climate change have always been a worrying factor to me. However, I also felt that the problems seemed so overwhelming big that I thought that I as an individual couldn’t really do anything about it. I think a lot of people feel the same impotence when we talk about environmental issues. We know about the general problem and we rather get upset with big contaminating companies than that we change something to our own daily habits. I have realised that change really does start by ourselves and that’s why I want to inspire as much people around the world as possible and let them feel that change is needed and that it all starts with changing our own habits. I want to do this by crossing Latin America in a sustainable vehicle. I will visit schools along the way to do my project and explain them why this is so important. I already started giving workshops and talks at schools in South America accompanied by movies about environmental subjects and I see the big impact this has on those kids. I think that even though nowadays where we live in a society where obtaining information became very easy for everybody it is still very important or even more important to physically visit people and bring the information to them. I think this way you can have a real impact on them showing what's happening with our planet and teach them the existing alternatives to live a more sustainable life. The sustainable vehicle with all the products and objects I use to be able to live on zero waste, is a great live example and will make it easier to teach them how to apply this on their own lives. What I need and how I thank you for your supportTo make this project successful I will need to make a fully sustainable vehicle. this will cost me around 20.000 euro's. Apart from that I want to show movies with a mobile cinema. Therefore I will need equipment, which will cost me around 2.000 euros. To make the documentary about the whole trip and to keep you all updated with videos and tutorials I will need to buy film equipment like cameras lenses and hard disks this will cost me around 3.000 euro's. In total I will need 25.000 euro’s to be able to start the project.How will I thank you for your support? First of all I think it is important to say that the main goal of this project is to spread the word about environmental issues with a real life example of the sustainable driving bus (with sustainable working products in it) and the mobile cinema in combination with the workshops and talks. Helping me with this project means that you are helping the world a step forward to make of it a better one! You can donate whatever amount you want and you can choose to get a CD with songs sung by me especially made for this project where you can listen to songs from countries that I will be visiting during my trip. If you sell or produce a product that has to do with sustainable living and you are interested in promotion of it, there is also the possibility to donate a product and I will make promotion for it during my trip by showing it and by sticking the name of the brand on the back of my vehicle.€​15> Digital Thank You! To show my thanks, I will send you a special thank you note and you get a colouring picture of the project. (download file)€​30> I will send you a digital song sung by me with ‘Dúo Tódo’ €​50>  I sent you my CD with music from countries I will be visiting during the project in Latin-America. sung by me especially made for this project.€​100> Get free access to watch the documentary that I will make about the whole trip. (available after the whole project is finished)€​1000> This is such a big help to my project! If time and place coincide I will perform live for you and sing you some songs! We can also have contact to see if there is other ways how I can thank you for such a big help! When is my donation going to be used?Before this whole project starts I will be in brasil, Holland and Spain for a while. I start to build the vehicle from September/October 2018 in California and when it’s ready I start driving. The exact date I start driving is difficult to tell because it will depend a lot on how easy it is to convert the vehicle into a totally sustainable one.What if I don't reach the entire amount of financial support?If I don’t reach my entire goal with this crowdfunding campaign it doesn’t mean that this project is not going to happen. I will definitely do everything to make this project a success so I will keep searching for funding and apart from that I will work as much as possible to be able to start in September/October 2018.The impactYour contribution whether it’s big or small will help me and the planet enormously. In the direct form it will help me to get everything ready to start the project but indirectly your contribution will help even more because it will help the thousands of people I will visit with the project to get inspired to help the planet! This means that YOU can have a tremendous impact on saving this planet just by helping my project with your contribution. I already started in Argentina with teaching about environmental issues by projecting movies, giving workshops and talks and making music in primary and secondary schools. In one word a big success! I have been invited to talk on several local radio stations to come and talk about the project and several newspapers wrote about the success of my visits.Risks & ChallengesThere are a few things that might be challenging during this whole project. The first thing is that I am running this project alone. Even though that’s my choice I should be aware of the fact that sometimes things can go slower or that I really need help sometimes to get things done. I think this is a challenge but the enormous drive I feel inside about making a success of this project will help me to move on!To make a vehicle 100% sustainable there is technology needed and people who are willing to help me building it. A risk would be that I don’t find the way to make a 100% sustainable vehicle. I think all the contacts I made the past 2 years will definitely help me with this challenge. In that case I will not be able to make it 100% sustainable I will make the vehicle partial sustainable with the possibility that during the trip the vehicle will become more sustainableevery time.Other ways you can help meThere are a bunch of other ways to help me and they are as valuable as money! If you sell sustainable products from whatever kind that I can promote during my trip, donating those products would be a great way of helping me. I can promote those products by showing people how I use them and by sticking your name on my vehicle! Or just help me to spread the word and share my story and campaign, talk with people about it and share it on your Facebook, twitter or Instagram with the Indiegogo share tools.Picture: Workshop making natural toothpaste picture: giving a talk about plastic pollution on a rural school  Help jij mij de wereld te inspireren? Wat fijn dat je even de tijd neemt om mijn campagne te bekijken! Ik ben Jorien Timmers (26), afgestudeerd psychologe en sinds twee jaar reizende door verschillende landen.Ik heb me eigenlijk van kleins af aan al bezig gehouden met milieukwesties. Ik heb me er ook op verschillende manieren voor ingezet. Ondanks de zorgen die ik me er soms over maakte, overheerste echter vaak een gevoel van onmacht, omdat de problemen zo ontzettend groot bleken te zijn, dat ik dacht: Wat kan ík hier nou eigenlijk echt aan doen? Ik denk dat veel mensen dit gevoel van onmacht wel kennen als het gaat om het oplossen van milieukwesties. We kennen het probleem, maar worden vaak boos op de grote milieuvervuilende bedrijven, zonder dat we echt eens goed bekijken wat we er zelf allemaal aan kunnen doen. Ik heb me gerealiseerd, dat verandering toch echt bij onszelf begint en dat is de aanleiding geweest voor mijn project. Ik wil zoveel mogelijk mensen over de hele wereld inspireren en laten zien, dat verandering nodig is en dat deze verandering begint bij het veranderen van onze eigen dagelijkse gewoonten. Ik ga dit doen door met een milieuvriendelijke bus en een mobiele bioscoop van Californië naar het zuiden van Argentinië te reizen. Tijdens deze reis zal ik zo min mogelijk afval produceren. Ik wil scholen, culturele centra e.d gaan bezoeken met het doel bewustzijn te creëren door middel van het tonen van films over milieu thema’s zoals het gebruik van plastic en aan de hand hiervan wil ik lezingen en workshops geven. Hierbij zal het levende voorbeeld van mijn leven met zo min mogelijk afval de milieuvriendelijke bus zijn, waarin ik producten gebruik, die zoveel mogelijk milieuvriendelijk zijn. Ik wil hiermee de mensen inspireren en vooral ook laten voelen, dat verandering nodig is en ook de mogelijkheden laten zien hoe we deze verandering kunnen aanpakken. Het feit dat er vandaag de dag zoveel informatie beschikbaar is op elk gebied, zo ook op dit gebied, wil niet zeggen, dat het ook aankomt bij mensen. Ik denk dat een fysiek persoon met een fysiek voorbeeld echt een indruk kan maken en iemand kan inspireren ook zelf aan de slag te gaan door het zien van voorbeelden over hoe te kunnen leven met minder afval.Wat ik nodig heb voor dit project en hoe ik jou bedank?Om van dit project een succes te maken, zal ik een bus moeten kopen en ombouwen tot een milieuvriendelijke bus. Dit zal me rond de 20.000 euro gaan kosten. Daarnaast wil ik films laten zien met een mobiele milieuvriendelijke bioscoop. Hiervoor zal ik rond de 2.000 euro nodig hebben. En om van dit hele project een documentaire te maken zal ik materiaal nodig hebben zoals camera’s, lenzen en hard disks. Dit alles zal rond de 3.000 euro’s gaan kosten. In totaal zal ik dus rond de 25.000 euro nodig hebben om te kunnen starten met dit project.Wat krijg jij? Ten eerste is het belangrijk te weten dat het hoofddoel van dit project het verspreiden van bewustwording is op het gebied van milieukwesties aan de hand van het levende voorbeeld, namelijk de milieuvriendelijke bus, die volledig milieuvriendelijk functioneert. En daarnaast met de mobiele bioscoop die mee gaat en de workshops en talks die gegeven worden. Het doneren aan mijn project betekent eigenlijk het mee helpen redden van deze planeet. Je kunt elk bedrag doneren en daarvoor ontvang je een persoonlijk bedankje in de vorm van een in eigen beheer opgenomen cd met liedjes door mijzelf gezongen van de landen die ik zal aandoen op mijn reis. Als je een verkoper of maker bent van een product, dat te maken heeft met milieuvriendelijk leven, dan is er ook de mogelijkheid een product te doneren, zodat ik dit product tijdens mijn reis promoot doormiddel van het demonstreren ervan en daarnaast door uw logo/merk op de achterkant van mijn busje te plakken.€ 15,00> Digitaal bedankje met bijgevoegd een kleurplaat van het project (pdf)€ 30,00> Ik stuur je een online liedje van ‘Dúo Tódo’€ 50,00 > Ontvang mijn cd met liederen gezongen door mij zelf van de landen, die ik tijdens mijn reis ga bezoeken in Latijns-America.€1000 > Dit is echt een geweldige bijdrage aan mijn project. Als tijd en plaats samenvallen kom ik live voor je zingen! We kunnen ook even contact opnemen over andere manieren hoe ik je zou kunnen bedanken voor deze grote bijdrage aan mijn project!Wanneer zal mijn donatie gebruikt worden?Voordat dit hele project begint, zal ik nog een tijdje in Brazilië, Spanje en Nederland zijn. Het plan is, dat ik ga beginnen met het bouwen van het busje in september/oktober 2018 in Californië en als dat klaar is begint de reis. De exacte datum is moeilijk in te schatten, want dat zal afhangen van hoe snel het ombouwen van het busje zal gaan.Wat als ik mijn gehele doelbedrag niet haal?Als ik mijn gehele doelbedrag niet bij elkaar krijg via de crowdfunding-actie, zal dit niet betekenen dat het niet doorgaat. Ik ga er alles aan doen om van dit project een succes te maken en ik zal daarom door blijven gaan met financiële steun zoeken en daarnaast zal ik zo veel mogelijk gaan werken, zodat ik weg kan gaan op de streefdatum, namelijk september 2018.Impact Jouw bijdrage, al is het klein of groot, kan dit project en deze planeet een hele grote stap vooruit helpen. Direct zal het mij helpen om alles voor te bereiden en in orde te maken en te vertrekken, maar indirect zal jou bijdrage nog veel meer invloed hebben. Het zal het namelijk mogelijk maken alle mensen die ik op mijn reis tegenkom te inspireren bewuster met deze planeet om te gaan door hun gewoonten te veranderen. Dit betekent dat JIJ een enorme impact kan hebben op het redden van deze planeet alleen al door het doneren van geld.Ik ben in Argentinië al gestart met lesgeven over milieu-issues door middel van films en presentaties en door het geven van workshops en het maken van muziek op scholen. In één woord een groot succes. Ik ben daarnaast gevraagd op verschillende lokale radiostations om mijn verhaal te doen en verschillende kranten hebben artikelen geschreven, over het succes van mijn project op scholen.Risico’s en uitdagingenEr zijn een aantal uitdagingen aan dit project. De eerste is het feit dat ik dit project zelf run. Ook al is dit mijn bewuste keuze, het zal niet altijd makkelijk zijn en sommige dingen zullen daardoor langzamer gaan dan gewild en ik zal soms hulp moeten vragen aan derden. Dit is een echte uitdaging, maar ik denk dat de enorme drive die ik voel om door te zetten met dit project, me hierin enorm zal helpen!Om het busje 100% milieuvriendelijk te maken is er technologie nodig en zijn er mensen nodig die bereid zijn te helpen het busje zo milieuvriendelijk mogelijk om te bouwen. Een risico is, dat ik niet de perfecte manier vind om het busje totaal milieuvriendelijk te krijgen. Ik denk dat de contacten, die ik de afgelopen 2 jaar gemaakt heb, zeker helpen bij deze uitdaging. Indien het toch lastig wordt het busje volledig milieuvriendelijk te maken, zal hij gedeeltelijk milieuvriendelijk gemaakt worden met de mogelijkheid hem onderweg steeds milieuvriendelijker te laten rijden.Andere manieren waarop je me kunt helpen?Er zijn vele manieren waarop je me zou kunnen helpen en deze zijn net zo waardevol als geld! Als je milieubewuste/vriendelijke producten verkoopt of maakt van wat voor soort dan ook, dan kan ik daar reclame voor maken tijdens mijn reis. Het doneren van deze producten geeft mij de mogelijkheid deze producten te gebruiken in mijn busje en te laten zien aan anderen hoe ze werken. Daarnaast kan ik een sticker van het merk achter op de bus plakken. Of je kunt helpen mijn campagne te delen op Facebook, twitter en Instagram met de Indiegogo share tool. Of gewoon van mond op mond.picture: giving a talk about plastic pollution on a secondary school, Argentinapicture: Visiting a school in rural village in Argentina showing movies about environmental problems ¿Me ayudas a inspirar al mundo?¡Gracias por tomar tu tiempo para leer y seguir mi campaña! Soy Jorien Timmers (26) de Holanda, psicóloga recibida y actualmente vivo viajando por el mundo. Con mucho gusto les cuento cómo empezó todo este proyecto.El cambio climático y los problemas ambientales siempre han sido un factor preocupante para mí. Sin embargo, me parecían tan grandes que sentí que yo, como individuo, no podía hacer tanto al respecto. Creo que nos pasa a muchos de nosotros el sentimiento de impotencia cuando hablamos de temas medio ambientales. Conocemos el problema general y preferimos quejarnos sobre las grandes empresas contaminantes, en vez de enfocarnos en lo que nosotros mismos diariamente podemos hacer al respecto por ejemplo al cambiar nuestros hábitos. Me di cuenta que el cambio realmente comienza por nosotros mismos y es por eso que quiero inspirar a las personas de todo el mundo y hacerles sentir que se necesita un cambio y que ellos mismos pueden tener mucha influencia en ese cambio.El proyecto que quiero comenzar es el siguiente: Quiero cruzar América Latina en un vehículo sustentable. Llevando un cine móvil y dando talleres y charlas sobre temas medio ambientales. Durante el viaje vivo sin producir basura. Visitaré entre ellas, escuelas y centros culturales. Ya empecé a dar talleres y charlas en escuelas en Latino América, y veo el gran impacto que tiene en los niños y adultos. Creo que a pesar de que hoy en día vivimos en una época en la que obtener información resulta muy fácil para todos, no es de menor importancia visitar físicamente a las personas para acercarles la información, y de esta manera, puede tener un impacto real en ellos, mostrando lo que está sucediendo con nuestro planeta y brindando alternativas diversas para vivir una vida con mayor conciencia. El vehículo sustentable en el que me trasladaré por Latino América, será de gran ejemplo vivo, ya que uno de objetivos primordiales del viaje será vivir sin generar basura y hará que sea más fácil enseñar cómo aplicar esto en la vida de las personas que sean atravesadas por este viaje.Que necesito y como te agradezco la ayuda?Para dar el punta pie inicial a este proyecto, tendré que adaptar un vehículo para convertirlo completamente a sustentable. Esto me costará alrededor de 20000 euros. Aparte de eso, quiero mostrar películas a través de un cine móvil y necesitaré equipamiento, que me costará aproximadamente 2000 euros.Para hacer ‘El documental’ de todo el viaje, necesitaré comprar equipos, como lentes, cámaras y discos duros, esto me costará alrededor de 3000 euros. En total, necesitaré 25,000 euros para poder comenzar el proyecto.¿Cómo le agradezco? En primer lugar, creo que es importante decir que el objetivo principal de este proyecto es difundir información sobre los problemas medio ambientales que afectan nuestro planeta para generar consciencia. Ayudarme con este proyecto significa que estás ayudando al mundo y en la concientización para que las personas comiencen a cuidarlo. A cambio de tu donación, del cual tú puedes elegir la cantidad de dinero que colaboras, les envío un CD en el cual canto canciones de países de Latino America los cuales voy a visitar con mi proyecto ‘Eco Bus América’. Además, si vendes o produces un producto que tiene que ver con vivir de manera sustentable y estas interesado en promocionarlo, existe la posibilidad de donar tu producto y lo mencionaré durante mi viaje mostrándolo a la gente y pondré su logo/marca atrás en mi vehículo.€ 15,00 > Para mostrarle mi agradecimiento, le enviaré un agradecimiento especial digitalmente. Te mando también una imagen para colorear del proyecto.€ 30,00 > Te enviaré una canción digital cantada por mí con 'Dúo Tódo'€ 50,00 > te envío mi CD con música de los países que visitaré durante el proyecto en América Latina.€ 1000 > Iré a visitarte para brindarle un concierto en vivo antes, durante o después de mi viaje. Voy a tocar en vivo para ti en una fiesta que des / en un evento que tengas o en otras ocasiones. Dependiendo de la hora y el lugar, ire con o sin mi dúo  musical Guillermo Zocca. (tendremos contacto para definir las posibilidades de donde y cuando se realizara el encuentro. (Antes que comience el proyecto Eco Bus América, estaré en España, Holanda y durante mi viaje visitaré países entre California y el sur de Argentina)¿Cuándo se va a usar tu donación?Antes de que todo este proyecto comience, estaré en Brasil, Holanda y España por un tiempo. Empiezo a construir el vehículo desde Septiembre/Octubre 2018 en California y cuando está listo, comienzo el viaje hacia la Patagonia. La fecha exacta en que inicio el viaje es difícil de determinar porque dependerá mucho del proceso de convertir el vehículo en uno sustentable.¿Qué sucede si no llego a recibir suficiente financiamiento con este crowdfunding?Si no alcanzo a recibir todo el dinero que necesitaría con esta campaña de crowdfunding, no significa que este proyecto no vaya a suceder. Haré todo para que este proyecto sea un éxito, así que seguiré buscando fondos y aparte de eso trabajaré hasta el momento de partir que será septiembre/octubre de 2018.El impactoTu contribución, ya sea grande o pequeña, ayudará muchísimo al proyecto y al planeta. En la forma directa, me ayudará a preparar todo para iniciar el proyecto, pero indirectamente, su contribución ayudará aún más porque le permitirá  a miles de personas a  inspirarse para ayudar al planeta. Esto significa que TU vas a ser parte del impacto que generará el proyecto simplemente colaborando con mi proyecto.En Argentina ya empecé a visitar escuelas dando charlas y mostrando películas sobre temas ambientales. ¡En una palabra, un éxito! Fui invitada a hablar en varias radios de diferentes localidades para hablar sobre el proyecto y varios diarios escribieron sobre el impacto de mis visitas.Riesgos y desafíosHay algunas cosas que pueden ser desafiantes durante este proyecto. Primero de todo estoy haciendo este proyecto sola. A pesar de que esa es mi elección, debo ser consciente del hecho que de esa forma las cosas pueden tomar mas tiempo y pueden ser mas difíciles a veces. Esto es un desafío, pero estoy segura que la enorme motivación que siento a cerca del proyecto me ayudara siempre para seguir adelante! Además, sé que cuando uno hace un proyecto solo, nunca esta totalmente solo y siempre se puede pedir ayuda.Para hacer que un vehículo sea sustentable, se necesita tecnología y personas dispuestas a ayudar para construirlo. Un riesgo sería que no encuentre la forma de hacer un vehículo 100% sustentable. Creo que todos los contactos que hice los últimos dos años me ayudaran mucho con este desafío. En caso de no lograr convertir el vehículo totalmente sustentable, lo haré parcialmente. Con la posibilidad que durante el viaje, el vehículo se vaya transformando cada vez mas sustentable.Otras maneras en que me puedes ayudar ¡Hay muchas otras formas para ayudarme y son igual de valiosas como el dinero!

We will be verified at the end of the year by the BCorp organization. When we found out the kind of difference as little as $1,000 can make in poor and developing countries especially in communities– it was clear that so much can be done with access to cash. But cash is so hard to come by for these communities – there are promises and  advice to fill out grant applications and sometimes donations of clothing – but no capital. As a result - no flexibility.In Timor-Leste and Indonesia I have met women that can and have made change happen with their dedication, leadership, action and a little bit of money. These changes are extraordinary - real and local and where communities are receiving the least help.When I thought about how to help - an idea came to me in the middle of the night (don't you love that?) about wearing armor - like Athena - but more modern. Something that I could have with me when I went into a big business meeting or could give my kids when they were going to school to let them know they were Strong, Extraordinary and Loved beyond measure.

  WHY?Always -20% pre-tax profit to global charities Local organizations help people in need at the very basic level. Many of them are small, run in community builders’ spare time and have no sustainable access to funds. Some have issues writing grant applications in English. Though some contribute to phenomenal outcomes – they are not chosen to receive funding from their State, or from funding sources like the United Nations or Global donors. Sometimes small amounts of funding for local organizations can make the difference to many people that we just don’t see and there aren’t all that many sources.Love’s Inner Armor’s Advisory Board and eventual Board of Directors will choose funding recipients each year based on emerging issues and objectives.  Sometimes it may grant multi-year funding for specific projects when income from the business is stable.As it grows, Love’s Inner Armor intends to use elements of user involvement to help choose where the 20% goes.

They are run by two very respected women. Both have won human rights rewards and one - Bella Galhos recently won the Dalai Lama's Unsung Heroes Award for her work in Maubisse, Timor Leste.These two organizations  - YKBH Justitia (Indonesia)  and Leublora Green School (Timor-Leste) had the following outcomes for very little money last year. They:

Helped 35 women with no water access points to plant, irrigate harvest and sell crops. Then they created a Women's Coop to help each other continue these activities. They needed a pump, a water reservoir and seeds.

Funded training was held to reinforce women & children's human rights and teach them to advocate for them  - it also trained police officers and community officials such as schools to look for signs and understand how to help when they suspected violence.

<h3>Bonjour,</h3>
<p>Hervé (51 ans) est ingénieur du son, réalisateur audio-visuel, et moi, Orély (39 ans) je suis maraîchère et animatrice. Nous sommes deux passionnés par la nature et l'éco-construction car depuis longtemps engagés activement pour la réduction de notre impact sur l'environnement. Forts d’une expérience de vie en montagne pendant plus de 10 ans, nous franchissons un cap avec ce projet que nous souhaitons commun, en autonomie énergétique, en autonomie alimentaire, avec le support des ressources de la montagne et de votre contribution.</p>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<p>Insatisfaits des dérives du système qui se fait au détriment de la biodiversité et du bien être de l'humain, nous avons la volonté de partager avec vous notre désir profond de :</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>“changer maintenant vers l'autonomie éco-responsable”</strong></p>
<p>en réalisant avec et dans la montagne, un lieu de ressourcement 100% écologique comprenant des habitats autonomes en énergie construits à partir des ressources locales et de matériaux naturels.</p>
<p>Nous croyons fermement qu'il est possible au XXI° siècle d'acquérir une autonomie énergétique et alimentaire tout en préservant le confort indispensable au bien être.</p>
<p>Nous aurions pu réaliser ce projet avec un financement bancaire mais nous faisons le choix courageux de vous associer à cette aventure ambitieuse. Nous souhaitons avant tout, valoriser l'éthique de votre initiative en faveur de ce projet qui verra le jour grâce a votre soutien.</p>
<p>Si nous souhaitons développer ensemble, un écosystème durable respectueux des hommes et de la nature, il est primordial que l'habitat et les modes de productions alimentaires et énergétiques soient cohérents avec l’impact sur l’environnement.</p>
<p>De plus, nous avons à coeur de rendre accessible ce mode vie à tous ceux qui souhaitent partager notre aventure.

<h3>Pourquoi nous avons besoin de vous :</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>L'objectif de cette campagne est de compléter le financement du terrain et de démarrer les premiers aménagements qui nous permettront de construire le prototype de la maison <a href=""https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionnaire_raisonn%C3%A9_de_l%E2%80%99architecture_fran%C3%A7aise_du_XIe_au_XVIe_si%C3%A8cle/Ogive"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ogivale</a> que nous avons conçue, avec les proportions du nombre d'or, en accord avec les techniques traditionnelles.</p>
<p>Pour y arriver, nous avons besoin de 7000 €.</p>
<p>Concrètement, votre contribution nous permettra de financer par ordre de priorité  :</p>
<ul>
<li>les 3000€  qui nous manquent (sur 17000€) pour l'achat du terrain (signature autour du 15 janvier chez le notaire)</li>
<li>un tracteur 4x4 d'occasion  : 2300€</li>
<li>le terrassement de la piste et de l'emplacement de la construction : 1000€</li>
<li>700€ d'outillage </li>
</ul>
<p>Le terrain se situe au bout d'une piste de 700m, déjà utilisable, mais il est nécessaire de faire venir une mini pelle pour une journée afin de la réhabiliter. Il suffira de combler les ornières et de creuser quelques revers d'eau pour que le ruissellement ne l'endommage pas à nouveau et la piste deviendra confortablement praticable.</p>
<p>Nous devrons tout d'abord installer un camp de base, très sommaire, qui nous permettra de dormir et manger durant la durée des travaux. Une surface de 40 m2 maximum, couverte de <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZA1J8RHltY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bardeaux</a> (que nous avons déjà), alimentée avec l'eau de la source, un petit poêle bois et des toilettes sèches.</p>
<p>Le tracteur permettra de transporter les matériaux sur le terrain et d'accéder aux différentes parcelles de forêt pour en tirer le bois d'oeuvre, essentiellement du châtaignier, et avec notre scierie mobile nous pourrons usiner sur place toutes les pièces nécessaires à la construction.</p>
<p>Et une fois que toutes les pièces du puzzle seront prêtes, la première ogive, grâce à vous, pointera son nez au coeur de la forêt dans laquelle les premières cultures commenceront à donner leurs fruits.</p>
<p>Nous passerons ensuite à l'alimentation énergétique de la bâtisse : hydro-électricité, <a href=""http://www.onpeutlefaire.com/produire-son-propre-biogaz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">b</a><a href=""http://www.onpeutlefaire.com/produire-son-propre-biogaz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iogaz</a> et <a href=""http://phytoepuration.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">phyto-épuration</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>L'impact </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>La construction de ce prototype doit servir à montrer que construire une habitation  autonome en énergie et qui soit à la fois esthétique, confortable et respectueuse de la nature doit être à la portée de tous.</li>
<li>Cette première construction nous servira de modèle et d'entrainement pour construire les autres car notre objectif final est de construire 4 gîtes de forme ogivale et un studio d'enregistrement autonome en électricité.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nous avons tous les deux des parcours qui nous ont préparés à cette aventure. Hervé a déjà conçu et construit une maison dodécagonale en bois et a vécu en montagne à 1000 m d'altitude durant de nombreuses années. </p>
<p>Orély a été maraîchère bio pendant plusieurs années, en montagne et en autonomie énergétique, dans une exploitation où toutes les terres, en terrasses, étaient cultivées manuellement.</p>
<p>Nous avons donc parfaitement conscience de l'ampleur du travail qui nous attend et nous nous savons capables d'aller jusqu'au bout de cette aventure.                   </p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<h3>Le challenge</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Le terrain sur lequel nous allons nous installer est à l'abandon depuis de nombreuses années et la végétation a repris ses droits. Les difficultés viendront du fait que le terrain est assez pentu et que nous serons à 950 m d'altitude et serons tributaires des aléas météorologiques inhérents au climat de montagne.</p>
<p>Nous avons comme avantages que la piste se divise en 2 et permet d'accéder au terrain par en haut et par en bas, et fait en sorte que l'inconvénient de la pente se transforme en avantage car il sera toujours possible de faire descendre les charges lourdes.</p>
<p>L'altitude est compensée par le fait que l'exposition est plein sud et offre un ensoleillement régulier tout au long de l'année mais nous ne pourrons éviter quelques épisodes neigeux durant l'hiver.</p>
<p>Nous n'allons pas complètement défricher la magnifique forêt de châtaigniers qu'est devenu ce terrain, juste éclaircir un peu pour faire rentrer la lumière et installer une forêt comestible aussi appelé jardin forêt : un écosystème où on trouvera des plantes comestibles à tous les étages de végétation, du plus grand arbre jusqu'au champignon.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536240407/ggsxlnoyh20dt5ykkonz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> Les anciennes prairies qui sont aujourd'hui recouvertes de fougères seront tout d'abord coupées à ras, puis nous utiliseront le bois en décomposition dans la forêt pour installer des buttes ""permaculturelles"", sans labourer ni abîmer la terre et ses micro-organismes qui en constituent toute la richesse.</p>

<h3>D'autres manières de contribuer</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Si ce projet vous parle, et que vous n'avez pas les moyens financiers de participer, vous pouvez quand même nous aider.</p>
<p>Nous aurons besoin de bras pour construire ou pour défricher et si vous pensez pouvoir vous rendre utile de quelque façon que ce soit, (coups de main, prêt de matériel, conseils ...) n'hésitez surtout pas à nous contacter, votre aide sera la bienvenue.</p>
<p>Et il est également une façon de participer qui ne coute rien mais qui, malgré tout, peut nous aider énormément, c'est de parler de notre projet autour de vous et de le partager dans le réseau de vos connaissances et sur tous vos réseaux sociaux.</p>

Pourquoi nous avons besoin de vous :

Et une fois que toutes les pièces du puzzle seront prêtes, la première ogive, grâce à vous, pointera son nez au coeur de la forêt dans laquelle les premières cultures commenceront à donner leurs fruits.
Nous passerons ensuite à l'alimentation énergétique de la bâtisse : hydro-électricité, biogaz et phyto-épuration. 
 
L'impact 
 

La construction de ce prototype doit servir à montrer que construire une habitation  autonome en énergie et qui soit à la fois esthétique, confortable et respectueuse de la nature doit être à la portée de tous.
Cette première construction nous servira de modèle et d'entrainement pour construire les autres car notre objectif final est de construire 4 gîtes de forme ogivale et un studio d'enregistrement autonome en électricité.

Nous avons tous les deux des parcours qui nous ont préparés à cette aventure. Hervé a déjà conçu et construit une maison dodécagonale en bois et a vécu en montagne à 1000 m d'altitude durant de nombreuses années.

Nous avons comme avantages que la piste se divise en 2 et permet d'accéder au terrain par en haut et par en bas, et fait en sorte que l'inconvénient de la pente se transforme en avantage car il sera toujours possible de faire descendre les charges lourdes.
L'altitude est compensée par le fait que l'exposition est plein sud et offre un ensoleillement régulier tout au long de l'année mais nous ne pourrons éviter quelques épisodes neigeux durant l'hiver.
Nous n'allons pas complètement défricher la magnifique forêt de châtaigniers qu'est devenu ce terrain, juste éclaircir un peu pour faire rentrer la lumière et installer une forêt comestible aussi appelé jardin forêt : un écosystème où on trouvera des plantes comestibles à tous les étages de végétation, du plus grand arbre jusqu'au champignon.
 
 Les anciennes prairies qui sont aujourd'hui recouvertes de fougères seront tout d'abord coupées à ras, puis nous utiliseront le bois en décomposition dans la forêt pour installer des buttes ""permaculturelles"", sans labourer ni abîmer la terre et ses micro-organismes qui en constituent toute la richesse.

<h3>ANALYSIS OF BIOMIMICRY IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC - LET'S FUND IT</h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>1 Mankind consumes too much of Earth's resources - about 1.7 times<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[1]</a> above its regenerative capacity. Moreover, we know most of the consumption is waste and overproduction.</p>
<p>2 The impact of this consumption is as massive: it has made extinct 54% of vertebrate species in the last 40 years<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[2]</a> and 82% of insects in the past 27 years</p>
<p>3 Why shall we in the Czech Republic and CEE region care?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">It also has an impact on us. E.g. since 2010, there was drought in the Czech Republic every year<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[3]</a>, cumulatively missing more and more rainfall and further deterioration of the water. So do we want water to be allocated on a daily quota as in South Moravia in summer 2018?</p>
<p>4 Plastics: Czech Republic is at the forefront of the rate of plastics recycling in Europe<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[4]</a>, but do we need to produce so many of them? Progressive countries are increasingly restricting the use and production of plastics.</p>
<p>5 There is a solution - a change in our approach to production and consumption: inspire from nature already during design. Nature has been already inventing for 3.8 billion years<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[5]</a>, it has answers to perhaps all of our questions. This approach is called “biomimicry”.</p>
<p>6 ""The golden Czech hands“ have already proven miracles. Czech science has a significant place in the World, “Czech golden hands” gaining real success in the world in the same time (technological start-ups<a href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[6]</a> , also to the existing AVG, Avast and Slovak-Czech Eset types). The potential of the combination of possibilities of Czech science and the biomimicry industry is a huge.</p>
<p>7 Biomimicry is not known in the Czech Republic, there is a lack of systematic approach and without researching for answers to complicated questions within Nature. Western Europe, led by Germany, has been using biomimicry for over 20 years delivering significant advantages to the German industry.</p>
<p>8 Although there are few examples of biomimicry in the Czech Republic, i.e. nano-textiles in Moira's thermos-clothes are inspired by the desert fox’s ears. Historically, Czechs have interesting results of science and medicine, so we can expect new discoveries in the future. Historic researchers were e.g. Jansky (blood types), Mendel (genetics), Wichterle (contact lenses), Heyrovsky (polaroid), Holy (medicine to cure HIV<a href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[7]</a>, used by cca 50% of the patients worldwide).</p>
<p>9 At the end of 2018, we established a non-profit institution called Biomimicry Analytics, aiming to promote awareness of biomimicry in the Czech Republic and Central Europe. We want biomimicry to be applied in a practical level – used by industry and science.</p>
<p>Legal establishment of the NGO: <a href=""https://or.justice.cz/ias/ui/rejstrik-firma.vysledky?subjektId=1037191&amp;typ=PLATNY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://or.justice.cz/ias/ui/rejstrik-firma.vys...</a></p>
<p>10 We have partners from Germany and the Netherlands who want to co-operate with us in the field of biomimicry in the Czech Republic. <a href=""http://www.biomimicrynl.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.biomimicrynl.org/</a>       <a href=""https://www.bionik-online.de/was-ist-bionik/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.bionik-online.de/was-ist-bionik/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>BIOMIMICRY TOPIC IS SO VAST, THAT WE ARE CONVINCED THAT IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND EFFICIENCT, WE NEED TO EFFECTUATE AN ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL IN THE COUNTRY. THIS SHALL GIVE US THE APPROPRIATE FOCUS.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

O Co jde?
 

Existují smíšené pocity ohledně naléhavosti opatření ke zlepšení životního prostředí. Současný politický a podnikový přístup má zlepšit několik procent ročně, aby uspokojil některé aktivisty a všeobecné očekávání. Říkáme tomu ""konvenční"" přístup, bohužel vzhledem ke stavu nadměrného užívání zdrojů není čas na tento “luxus”. Proto navrhujeme krok zpět, přiblížení se k přírodě a inspirace přírodou. Tento přístup se nazývá ""biomimikry"". Proto se chceme zabývat výzkumem a zvyšováním povědomí o udržitelnějších způsobech navrhování produktu a služeb obecně.Chceme analyzovat potenciál biomimikry v České republice na jednotlivé oblasti průmyslu a vědy. Úvod - co je biomimikry:Biomimikry je přístup k inovacím, který usiluje o udržitelné řešení lidských otázek tím, že napodobuje časem testované vzorce a strategie přírody. Základní myšlenkou je, že příroda již vyřešila většinu problémů, s nimiž se potýkáme. Zvířata, rostliny a mikroby jsou dokonalí inženýři. Po 3.8 miliard let výzkumu a vývoje nám to, co nás obklopuje - příroda - nabízí možná nejlepší odpovědi na přežití naší společnosti.Více informací:  https://biomimicry.org/   příklady v přírodě a srovnání s lidským přístupem https://youtu.be/sf4oW8OtaPY  (21min, ovšem úžasných)Jednoduché video vysvětlující v reálných příkladech Japonské vlakové inženýry a dalšíhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMtXqTmfta0 (7m) Proč? Proč teď?Myslíme si, že náš lidský svět byl podprůměrně navržen ve srovnání s 3,8 miliardy lety výzkumu a vývoje Země. Proč špatně navrženo: existuje mnoho problémů/škod životního prostředí způsobených lidmi a vyčerpáváme zdroje příliš rychle. „EIity“ které rozhodují a architekti procesů nemají úplný obraz a znalosti o biosféře - našeho největšího zdroje inspirace. Proč se neinspirovat více z přírody? To je to, o čem je biomimikry, a my bychom toto rádi zkoumali trochu více, abychom mohli sdílet cenné informace...Prostřednictvím naší první analýzy jsme měli přístup k mnoha publikacím o stavu světa (biodiverzita, klima, energie, finance atd.). Zjistili jsme, že široká veřejnost nebyla dostatečně informována.Naše studie trhu pomůže připravit budoucnost země / regionu a rozhýbat kola ""vtipného českého lokomotivního ducha"" a přispět tak k Evropské spolupráci. Níže uvedení partneři s námi chtějí spolupracovat, je třeba vytvořit základ pro to, aby se vše mohlo zrealizovat. Proč Česká republika?Česká republika je jedna z nejvyspělejších zemí z hlediska výzkumných schopností, dlouhé tradice průmyslu včetně nových technologií a vývoje softwaru s rozvinutými znalostmi biologie... toto vše jsou klíčová odvětví doprovázená silnou akademickou infrastrukturou a centry výzkumu a vývoje.

ANALYSIS OF BIOMIMICRY IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC - LET'S FUND IT
Short Summary
1 Mankind consumes too much of Earth's resources - about 1.7 times[1] above its regenerative capacity. Moreover, we know most of the consumption is waste and overproduction.
2 The impact of this consumption is as massive: it has made extinct 54% of vertebrate species in the last 40 years[2] and 82% of insects in the past 27 years
3 Why shall we in the Czech Republic and CEE region care?
It also has an impact on us. E.g. since 2010, there was drought in the Czech Republic every year[3], cumulatively missing more and more rainfall and further deterioration of the water. So do we want water to be allocated on a daily quota as in South Moravia in summer 2018?
4 Plastics: Czech Republic is at the forefront of the rate of plastics recycling in Europe[4], but do we need to produce so many of them? Progressive countries are increasingly restricting the use and production of plastics.
5 There is a solution - a change in our approach to production and consumption: inspire from nature already during design. Nature has been already inventing for 3.8 billion years[5], it has answers to perhaps all of our questions. This approach is called “biomimicry”.
6 ""The golden Czech hands“ have already proven miracles. Czech science has a significant place in the World, “Czech golden hands” gaining real success in the world in the same time (technological start-ups[6] , also to the existing AVG, Avast and Slovak-Czech Eset types). The potential of the combination of possibilities of Czech science and the biomimicry industry is a huge.
7 Biomimicry is not known in the Czech Republic, there is a lack of systematic approach and without researching for answers to complicated questions within Nature. Western Europe, led by Germany, has been using biomimicry for over 20 years delivering significant advantages to the German industry.
8 Although there are few examples of biomimicry in the Czech Republic, i.e. nano-textiles in Moira's thermos-clothes are inspired by the desert fox’s ears. Historically, Czechs have interesting results of science and medicine, so we can expect new discoveries in the future. Historic researchers were e.g. Jansky (blood types), Mendel (genetics), Wichterle (contact lenses), Heyrovsky (polaroid), Holy (medicine to cure HIV[7], used by cca 50% of the patients worldwide).
9 At the end of 2018, we established a non-profit institution called Biomimicry Analytics, aiming to promote awareness of biomimicry in the Czech Republic and Central Europe. We want biomimicry to be applied in a practical level – used by industry and science.
Legal establishment of the NGO: https://or.justice.cz/ias/ui/rejstrik-firma.vys...
10 We have partners from Germany and the Netherlands who want to co-operate with us in the field of biomimicry in the Czech Republic. http://www.biomimicrynl.org/       https://www.bionik-online.de/was-ist-bionik/
 
BIOMIMICRY TOPIC IS SO VAST, THAT WE ARE CONVINCED THAT IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND EFFICIENCT, WE NEED TO EFFECTUATE AN ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL IN THE COUNTRY. THIS SHALL GIVE US THE APPROPRIATE FOCUS.
PLEASE SUPPORT FINANCIALLY EXECUTION OF THIS ANALYSIS

Campaign

Why the Czech Republic - it's one of the most developed countries in terms of research capabilities, with a long industrial tradition in many sectors including biology-related sciences...  All the core sectors accompanied by strong academic infrastructure and R&D centers. AND yet there is little presence of biomimicry out there.

Creation of the study of the potential of biomimicry in the Czech Republic with the reflection where to focus first
Analysis of strengths, opportunities - SWOT of the Czech economy
Key CZ institutions active / with the highest potential in biomimicry
Conclusion: recommendations for the development of biomimicry sector in the country
Appendix: graphic part of industry maturity & count of active projects
Methodology:  contact list of experts with a list of biomimicry questions and compile with publicly available data.


Our partners are happy to collaborate on biomimicry in the Czech Republic and Europe wide context, we just need to have a basis where to start from. 

What We Need & What You Get

Analysis: To conduct an analysis, report total est. size: 100 pages

Total amount: 5,000 USD or 100,000 CZK (65,000 for the study, up to 20,000 for graphics interface, up to 5,000 for perks to donors, up to 10,000 for fees to the platform and banks)
You can choose from the following perks:
VIP seats at the conference announcing report results
Official sponsor/donor named in the initial Thank you page of the report
EARLY BID: Fibonacciho formula engraved to metal/wood
Sponsors'/donors' names entitled in the footnote of one page of the report which they sponsor


If we do not reach the goal, we will need to raise the money elsewhere.

The Impact

There are mixed feelings about the urgency of the actions to improve the environment. The current political and corporate approach is to improve a selected range of % KPIs each year to satisfy some activist and general expectations. This is referred to as the “conventional” approach.
Unfortunately and given the state of overuse of the resources, there is not a time for this luxury (see graphs for a ""reality check""). Hence our suggestion for a step back, getting closer to Nature and get inspiration from her. This approach is called “biomimicry”.  That is why we want to research and raise awareness about more sustainable ways of designing.
We want to analyze the potential of biomimicry in the Czech republic specifying the main focus areas.

By supporting this project, you contribute to the progress of mankind toward a greater harmony with nature and more diverse science.
Common sense reality: you contribute to preventing deepening of natural imbalances such as Drought in Europe of 2018, fires in California, floods in Asia, etc. Who wants to have water on quotas as in parts of southern Moravia in summer 2018?

Think about Gandhi´s quote:  ""Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's needs, but not every man's greed.""

The Leader of the Analysis worked on a similar analysis in other sectors with Frost & Sullivan in London. Other members of the team are statisticians and IT experts to support the leader.
Key is the large group of scientists/industrial experts which will provide detailed sector insights and potential.

Risks & Challenges
There are multiple challenges: to reach a significant number of scientists/industry experts on time, to keep sufficiently strong methodology to connect the dots properly, to assure enough multidisciplinarity in the analytical team, to make the conclusion on time.
How to overcome these challenges:

The Leader has experience with similar reports
Several team members are used to tight deadlines from the IT industry
We are a diverse team of statisticians, IT experts, economists, marketing expert 
We have a large network due to our different backgrounds and also thanks to relatives being scientists/industry experts


Other Ways You Can Help
We are definitely open for any kind of cooperation, either you can provide some scientist/expert contacts, help with the report itself or even help with running the NGO directly

The easiest help is certainly to spread the word of this campaign among your friends and connections! You may also use the Indiegogo share tools!
Be open-minded: environment is really a concern to all of us...

<h2>About Csoma’s Room</h2>
<p>The motto of the Csoma's Room Foundation is ""<i><strong>Explore - Understand - Cooperate</strong></i>"". These three words mean much more to us than a simple slogan. These three words sum up all our activities in the past 10 years, they describe what we believe in, they are the driving forces behind the development of our organisation. This is our approach to sustainable development in all our projects and initiatives, from the conservation of local built heritage through the building of passive solar houses up to education and community development. This is what connects our core team of experts who come with different professional backgrounds, but with a common approach.</p>

<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/sb4IwO0xwkE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<h3><i><strong>Explore</strong></i></h3>
<p>Exploring is meeting the unfamiliar, discovering and studying something new, gaining experience. Exploring is our starting point because we need firsthand experience to engage in a new project.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><i>In 2007 Olga and Balázs, the founders of Csoma's Room </i><i><i>Foundation,</i></i><i> arrived on bicycles to Zanskar, a remote, secluded valley in Ladakh, the Indian Himalayas. They were following the epic trail once undertaken by Alexander Csoma de Kőrös, a Hungarian scholar </i><i>and</i><i> explorer from the 19th century, who authored the first Tibetan-English dictionary. Csoma's footsteps led to Zangla village, lying at around 3700 meters above sea level. Here Olga and Balázs could catch a glimpse of the 16th century Palace, once the accommodation of Csoma, surrounded by numerous stupas, still magical in its then crumbling state.<br/>This was the moment when the idea for the Csoma's Room Foundation was born, its first project </i><i>being</i><i> the conservation of the Zangla Palace. And through this first </i><i><i>experience</i></i><i> we began to explore Zanskar.</i></p>
<p>Exploration is an ongoing process. Each year new volunteers join our programme to work for and with the local community. They discover not just the awe inspiring topography of the Indian Himalayas, but also the people and the culture of Ladakh, its values and teachings.<br/>The organisation also keeps on exploring; we try to challenge ourselves and our accumulated knowledge all the time in order to adapt, improve and be able to support the local communities.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i><strong>Understand</strong></i></h3>
<p>Experience alone is not enough, we need to study and understand the information gained through participation and observation. We combine experience with research and analysis to get a deeper understanding of the place and the circumstances we work in. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><i>While working on the Palace we got to know the community of Zangla and the people of Ladakh better. We gained more and more experience and we started to see how things worked in the Zanskar Valley. We </i><i>realised</i><i> there was much more we could do: Modernisation is arriving with full power to the region in the shape of government road constructions, media, and throw-away consumer goods. Communities that used to live in complete isolation until about 30 years ago are now going through rapid change. And it’s not just the culture and the local economy that faces challenges. Since it is an environment at the extreme limits of human existence, the climate change along with </i><i>the changing</i><i> weather conditions are putting this fragile high-altitude ecosystem at serious risk.<br/>Better understanding steered us towards new fields. We started to engage with the local community more closely via our education and community development initiatives. We also turned our focus from heritage conservation to community architecture that fuses the local traditional craft with innovations in passive solar design.</i></p>
<p>Research and the need for a better understanding provide us with the necessary tools to work responsibly for the benefit of the local communities.<br/>Through our volunteering programme, our public presentations and publications we try to pass our knowledge to a wider audience so that more people can understand the challenges faced by wonderful places like the Zanskar Valley.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i><strong>Cooperate</strong></i></h3>
<p>Working for a local community inevitably means closely cooperating with the community members. You can't achieve long-term sustainable results without involving the main actors and stakeholders. We treat them as partners and build development activities on cooperation and dialogue.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><i>Becoming more deeply involved in community actions made us increasingly sensitive towards the needs and dilemmas of the community. We also became aware of our role in local affairs. The Csoma’s Room Foundation aims to build a relationship where we can work together as a team with the local people, include them in the entire development process and enable its members to take the initiative.<br/>We don't always know all the answers to the problems faced by the families in Zanskar, but in a partnership</i><i> we can support them and find working solutions. We can help local carpenters make windows that make better use of the sun’s heat during cold winter days, we can work out effective teaching methods together with local families, we can assist the women to produce carpets, scarves, and other woven fabrics they can sell etc. In order to do so, we need to engage in a dialogue, build trust, constantly learn from the locals and support them by providing lacking resources, competences, and know-how.</i></p>
<p>Cooperation is something that keeps transforming us as an organisation. It's our motivation and it forces us to evolve constantly. The past ten years has been a long journey from the ambitious dreams and efforts of a small group of friends to working in a team with common goals. All our volunteers are part of this bond, that's why we maintain active relations with our alumni.</p>
<p><strong>We invite you to join and support </strong><strong>us,</strong><strong> so that we can provide more effective solutions, and better tools to this community.</strong></p>

<h2>Our Focus in the 2018 Season</h2>
<p><br/>In 2018 the organisation is piloting a new project called <strong>Community Solarisation</strong>, designed along the lines of our long-term goals while building upon our past work: the Solar School complex in Zangla, consisting of four classrooms and a teacher residence building, and the single-room Solar School in Tanpo built in 2017.</p>
<p>The Solarisation project takes our experiences and know-how one step further. Instead of erecting another public building, we intend to improve the quality of the village’s housing stock through tailor-made solar makeover of existing homes. The pilot phase will lay the foundations for the upcoming years. We will develop and test transferable and scalable practical solutions that we can later implement in other villages of the Zanskar region.</p>

<h2>Community Solarisation - Knowledge Transfer through Practice</h2>
<h3>Solarisation action plan for and with the local families</h3>
<p>Compared with our previous solar architecture projects the solar makeover of the homes of local families appears to be smaller in scale, however, it is a much more complex intervention requiring careful preparation and execution. The process relies on a deeper relationship and a more intense cooperation with the locals. Its results will have a much more direct impact on the lives of local families.</p>
<p>Construction work will be prepared by assessing the needs of local families, making use of data gathered through field research in the previous years. On site, we will also survey the housing stock of the village, and choose the first pilot sites by taking into account both social indicators and architectural factors. We will contact the selected families and agree on the terms of their involvement. Our goal is to involve the families and the community as much as possible and to share tasks and responsibilities. Once we have an agreement, the makeover can begin.</p>

<p>Solarisation will mean finding custom solutions for each house to improve its passive solar capacities - anything from changing the south-facing windows to bigger, double-glazed panes to improving the insulation of walls and the roof.

After finishing a home we will start monitoring the impacts of solarisation: keeping in touch with the families and conducting follow up interviews.</p>
<p>We count on creating a snowball effect by training local “solar architects” through practice: the local craftsmen involved in the first solar makeovers will be able to help their neighbours by applying their knowledge and skills of passive solar design.</p>
<p>The results of our project will be more homes heated by the Sun, less reliance on scarce resources like wood and yak dung, and better living conditions during harsh winters when temperatures often drop to minus 30-40 degrees Celsius.

</div></div>","About Csoma’s Room
The motto of the Csoma's Room Foundation is ""Explore - Understand - Cooperate"". These three words mean much more to us than a simple slogan. These three words sum up all our activities in the past 10 years, they describe what we believe in, they are the driving forces behind the development of our organisation. This is our approach to sustainable development in all our projects and initiatives, from the conservation of local built heritage through the building of passive solar houses up to education and community development. This is what connects our core team of experts who come with different professional backgrounds, but with a common approach.


 

 
Explore
Exploring is meeting the unfamiliar, discovering and studying something new, gaining experience. Exploring is our starting point because we need firsthand experience to engage in a new project.
In 2007 Olga and Balázs, the founders of Csoma's Room Foundation, arrived on bicycles to Zanskar, a remote, secluded valley in Ladakh, the Indian Himalayas. They were following the epic trail once undertaken by Alexander Csoma de Kőrös, a Hungarian scholar and explorer from the 19th century, who authored the first Tibetan-English dictionary. Csoma's footsteps led to Zangla village, lying at around 3700 meters above sea level. Here Olga and Balázs could catch a glimpse of the 16th century Palace, once the accommodation of Csoma, surrounded by numerous stupas, still magical in its then crumbling state.This was the moment when the idea for the Csoma's Room Foundation was born, its first project being the conservation of the Zangla Palace. And through this first experience we began to explore Zanskar.
Exploration is an ongoing process. Each year new volunteers join our programme to work for and with the local community. They discover not just the awe inspiring topography of the Indian Himalayas, but also the people and the culture of Ladakh, its values and teachings.The organisation also keeps on exploring; we try to challenge ourselves and our accumulated knowledge all the time in order to adapt, improve and be able to support the local communities.
 
Understand
Experience alone is not enough, we need to study and understand the information gained through participation and observation. We combine experience with research and analysis to get a deeper understanding of the place and the circumstances we work in. 
While working on the Palace we got to know the community of Zangla and the people of Ladakh better. We gained more and more experience and we started to see how things worked in the Zanskar Valley. We realised there was much more we could do: Modernisation is arriving with full power to the region in the shape of government road constructions, media, and throw-away consumer goods. Communities that used to live in complete isolation until about 30 years ago are now going through rapid change. And it’s not just the culture and the local economy that faces challenges. Since it is an environment at the extreme limits of human existence, the climate change along with the changing weather conditions are putting this fragile high-altitude ecosystem at serious risk.Better understanding steered us towards new fields. We started to engage with the local community more closely via our education and community development initiatives. We also turned our focus from heritage conservation to community architecture that fuses the local traditional craft with innovations in passive solar design.
Research and the need for a better understanding provide us with the necessary tools to work responsibly for the benefit of the local communities.Through our volunteering programme, our public presentations and publications we try to pass our knowledge to a wider audience so that more people can understand the challenges faced by wonderful places like the Zanskar Valley.
 
Cooperate
Working for a local community inevitably means closely cooperating with the community members. You can't achieve long-term sustainable results without involving the main actors and stakeholders. We treat them as partners and build development activities on cooperation and dialogue.
Becoming more deeply involved in community actions made us increasingly sensitive towards the needs and dilemmas of the community. We also became aware of our role in local affairs. The Csoma’s Room Foundation aims to build a relationship where we can work together as a team with the local people, include them in the entire development process and enable its members to take the initiative.We don't always know all the answers to the problems faced by the families in Zanskar, but in a partnership we can support them and find working solutions. We can help local carpenters make windows that make better use of the sun’s heat during cold winter days, we can work out effective teaching methods together with local families, we can assist the women to produce carpets, scarves, and other woven fabrics they can sell etc. In order to do so, we need to engage in a dialogue, build trust, constantly learn from the locals and support them by providing lacking resources, competences, and know-how.
Cooperation is something that keeps transforming us as an organisation. It's our motivation and it forces us to evolve constantly. The past ten years has been a long journey from the ambitious dreams and efforts of a small group of friends to working in a team with common goals. All our volunteers are part of this bond, that's why we maintain active relations with our alumni.
We invite you to join and support us, so that we can provide more effective solutions, and better tools to this community.

Our Focus in the 2018 Season
In 2018 the organisation is piloting a new project called Community Solarisation, designed along the lines of our long-term goals while building upon our past work: the Solar School complex in Zangla, consisting of four classrooms and a teacher residence building, and the single-room Solar School in Tanpo built in 2017.
The Solarisation project takes our experiences and know-how one step further. Instead of erecting another public building, we intend to improve the quality of the village’s housing stock through tailor-made solar makeover of existing homes. The pilot phase will lay the foundations for the upcoming years. We will develop and test transferable and scalable practical solutions that we can later implement in other villages of the Zanskar region.
Apart from our thorough knowledge of sustainable passive solar building design, our familiarity with local building materials and techniques, the project will also benefit from our long-term engagement with local families and the community as a whole. During the implementation we will combine our work in sustainable architecture with the research-based knowledge of the local society to create community architecture that involves and empowers the community and its members.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Milkweed Tussock Tubers Haymaker Fund</strong></p>
<p>       Alright. I want you to imagine your ideal, regenerative farm. An agricultural operation where endangered snipes and camouflaged killdeer are safe to nest. Where tiny bird eggs are tucked securely in grass as shaggy, heritage-breed cattle graze calmly around them. Breathe in the fragrance of a healthy soil ecosystem: here, we sequester carbon. Microbes and mushrooms sing as they feed flowers rich nutrients from recycled organic matter. Can you see them? And the pollinators, thriving as they visit endangered root vegetables - sunchokes, rare potatoes, groundnuts - who in turn feed you, feed the farmers, and feed the community. </p>
<p>                                                     <strong> Welcome to Milkweed Tussock Tubers.</strong></p>
<p>     In 2016, Milkweed Tussock Tubers was a dream and a logo in a sketchbook. Now St Lawrence County, New York's only seed potato business, we operate under the umbrella of Bittersweet Farm, our small-scale, diversified, certified organic sponsor organization. A woman-run, no-till farm, Milkweed Tussock Tubers takes our role as integral players in a complex, astonishing ecosystem very seriously. We work to: restore and re-popularize unusual and endangered root crops; farm in the most ecologically responsible way possible; and teach others to do the same. We provide our community with 16 tablestock potato varieties and three types of seedstock, while rejuvenating regionally developed spuds. We're also re-introducing groundnuts, sunchokes, wild ginger and Solomon's Seal, returning diversity to both terra and table. Our small scale means it's possible for us to focus on a wide range of projects, making our practices holistic in nature.</p>
<p>Alongside our efforts to bring gastronomical diversity to customers, we also freely share our extensive knowledge. Students, volunteers, customers and friends visit the farm and learn how to grow their own gardens, preserve their own food and save their own seeds, changing the world in ways both intimate and expansive.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>And, most excitingly, we're becoming a cow-powered farm!</strong></p>
<p>      MTT will be one of few farms in our area working with oxen. We are transitioning away from fossil fuels, and our beautiful heifer calves, Emma, Fern and Galadryal, are learning to pull a cultivator and dig potato trenches this year. Soon, they'll be strong enough to pull haying equipment, like a wagon, rake and mower. The EFGs are the inspiration for this fundraiser. These girls need appropriate equipment to do their jobs. Unique tools for unique workers on a unique farm. And the rest of the farm needs the same.</p>
<p>As a no-till operation with animals to feed, Milkweed Tussock Tubers relies on the hay we harvest with Bittersweet Farm. The 2,000 45-pound square bales we put up provide mulch hay for gardens and food and bedding for cows, sheep, pigs and poultry. Mulch builds soil organic matter, retains moisture, reduces weed pressure and prevents soil erosion. The diversity of our hay provides the animals with micronutrients and roughage, promoting healthy digestion. And our haying methods are different, as well. Unlike neighboring farms, we pay close attention to very specific creatures with whom we share the land: field birds. </p>
<p>Meadowlarks, bobolinks, red-winged blackbirds, savannah sparrows, killdeer and snipes are just a few of the feathered friends once common in Northern New York fields. Due to the industrialized haying methods of surrounding farms, these ground nesters are unable to successfully rear chicks. When large farms chop hay in May, eggs and baby birds are sucked up into drum mower blades and slaughtered. Repeated hayings throughout the season prevent parents from rebuilding their nests and trying again.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613858938/k44kf00oknomssg6kpeq.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>So What's The Problem??</strong></p>
<p>Well, after years of working with a second-hand mower and baler, our tools have fallen apart. We are unable to consistently cut, rake and bale our own hay. Our options include hiring someone to hay for us, with their equipment, or purchasing hay from off the farm. Unfortunately, both options put area field birds at greater risk. Hired hayers work on their own schedule, not ours or that of the birds, and purchased hay is something over which we have no control.

<h3>Coral Reefs and Our Research<br/>
</h3>
<p>Coral Reefs are declining at an incredible rate, and as a citizens of
 the World, we should all be concerned as our lives, even if we are 
nowhere near a coral reef, depend on them. Reefs cover less than 1% of 
the Earth's surface, yet they support 25% of the Ocean's marine life. 
These are fish and other creatures that humans depend on for food and 
livelihood. In fact, over 1 billion people in the world depend directly 
upon reefs for their livelihood with reefs contributing over 30 billion 
dollars to the world economy each year. Reefs help drive our weather 
patterns and protect our shorelines and homes from damage. We also pull 
many new medicines for combating disease from reefs. Additionally, reefs

Coral Reefs are declining at an incredible rate, and as a citizens of
 the World, we should all be concerned as our lives, even if we are 
nowhere near a coral reef, depend on them. Reefs cover less than 1% of 
the Earth's surface, yet they support 25% of the Ocean's marine life. 
These are fish and other creatures that humans depend on for food and 
livelihood. In fact, over 1 billion people in the world depend directly 
upon reefs for their livelihood with reefs contributing over 30 billion 
dollars to the world economy each year. Reefs help drive our weather 
patterns and protect our shorelines and homes from damage. We also pull 
many new medicines for combating disease from reefs. Additionally, reefs
 are just as important as the rainforest in the carbon cycle of our 
planet, serving as a sink and contributing greatly to the clean air that
 we need to breathe. If our reefs go away, each of our lives would be 
greatly affected. 


Our work can help ensure that coral reefs to not disappear from the planet.
We have already started to successfully bank some species, but we 
have a long way to go as there are hundreds, if not thousands of coral 
species around the world.
While we originally imagined our banks as ""an insurance policy for

During the long rains of March 2013, the local river
where I live near in Ngong (a small town located on the South West outskirts of
Nairobi, Kenya), flooded and scattered plastic all over the land. I was
horrified by this sight and decided to find out what was causing the pollution.
From my research I found that local garbage collectors dump trash collected
from homes in the area into a landfill near the river. Since the landfill isn’t
managed by the local government, the trash is carried into the river whenever
it rains.</p><p></p><p></p><h2><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""></span></h2><p>Looking back at my childhood, these rivers were clean! I remember
fetching water and bathing in them, and in less than 15 years most of them have
turned into polluted cesspools, dumping people’s trash into the ocean – an ocean

artist, leveraging eight years of creative experience and four years of law
school to build the social enterprise, Plastic Fantastic Kenya. I’m a hopeless
optimist and often engage in long afternoon sessions of day dreaming about a
better world - much to my co-founder’s consternation, of course.</p>
<p>As the “Creative Orchestrator” of Plastic Fantastic Kenya, I am
responsible for artisan relationships and product design. I lead upcycling
workshops and have a deep local network which I draw upon for sales and
marketing.</p>
<p>Jesah, my co-founder, grew up in the unspoiled, mountainous
terrain of Montana, USA. He was appalled when I showed him the plastic waste
profusely littered along the local river in Ngong. Having come to Kenya to
chase the dream of elevating consciousness through the curation of handcrafts
made by artisans from exotic cultures around the world, Jesah immediately saw
the viability of my vision on how to change the world through Plastic Fantastic.</p>
<p>Jesah acts as the Business Architect directing Plastic Fantastic’s
business trajectory. With a degree in Business Administration and five years
working as a consultant in corporate America, he isn’t your average westerner
living in Kenya. As a world traveler Jesah has lived in 26 places around the
globe – Kenya being just one of them. When Jesah isn’t building Plastic
Fantastic, he’s an amateur Buddhist Monk, and Mixed Martial Arts fighter (1 win

4.  Through sales and workshops we have generated 66,000 KSH (that’s $724!), over the past six months.Fun in the Sun!Aside from all this hard work we’ve been doing, we also have a fun side-project we’re really excited about. We hold a monthly tree growing event that engages local youth to grow trees on the side of Ngong Hills – voted by Travelzoo.com as one of the most romantic sites in the world, beating out Paris, New York, and Rome! We’ve had three tree growing events so far, and planted 54 trees. Wowza! Our goal for 2015 is to plant and grow 100 trees. You’d never guess how easy and fun it is to plant a tree in your neighborhood. It really is a walk in the park!The TeamAs I mentioned earlier, my name is Ciru - I’m a multi-dimensional
artist, leveraging eight years of creative experience and four years of law
school to build the social enterprise, Plastic Fantastic Kenya. I’m a hopeless
optimist and often engage in long afternoon sessions of day dreaming about a
better world - much to my co-founder’s consternation, of course.
As the “Creative Orchestrator” of Plastic Fantastic Kenya, I am
responsible for artisan relationships and product design. I lead upcycling
workshops and have a deep local network which I draw upon for sales and
marketing.
Jesah, my co-founder, grew up in the unspoiled, mountainous
terrain of Montana, USA. He was appalled when I showed him the plastic waste
profusely littered along the local river in Ngong. Having come to Kenya to
chase the dream of elevating consciousness through the curation of handcrafts
made by artisans from exotic cultures around the world, Jesah immediately saw
the viability of my vision on how to change the world through Plastic Fantastic.
Jesah acts as the Business Architect directing Plastic Fantastic’s
business trajectory. With a degree in Business Administration and five years
working as a consultant in corporate America, he isn’t your average westerner
living in Kenya. As a world traveler Jesah has lived in 26 places around the
globe – Kenya being just one of them. When Jesah isn’t building Plastic
Fantastic, he’s an amateur Buddhist Monk, and Mixed Martial Arts fighter (1 win
– 1 loss).
Learn about where Plastic Fantastic is going in 2015!


In order to be sustainable, we need to increase our income generated from sales. We will do this by creating as many distribution points for conscious consumers as possible. So far, we have entered into wholesale relationships with a shop in the U.S., a shop in Finland, and will soon be offering our items to a number of storefronts in Nairobi, Kenya. Our goal is to have 20 vendors worldwide selling our products by the end of the year.
We are half way through incorporating our business and should be fully registered by the end of January.
We are actively collaborating with a local artisan to handcraft upcycled display stands for our jewelry and accessories in retail shops.
The recycling campaign isn’t stopping with just one of Aga Khan’s schools – we hope to include four more schools into our recycling campaign before the year is out.

We need to finish developing our website – only 10% to go!



We need your help to raise funds to
accomplish these goals for 2015!

Help Us Get There!
We have “bootstrapped” by exhausting most of our available resources and now we need your help to maintain this impact.Both of us, eat, sleep, and breathe Plastic Fantastic - it has been A TON of hard work for Jesah and me. With your help, we won’t let up anytime soon!Check out the donation perks to the right to see which contribution tugs at your heart.We’ve done our market research and have reached out to people in all walks of life throughout the Nairobi community. They are relieved and thrilled someone is doing something about all the plastic flying around…and yes, the plastic is literally FLYING!Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand not everyone can make a monetary contribution, but that doesn't mean you can’t make a huge difference! We need your voice!You can support us by getting word out to your friends, family and social networks about this exciting movement we are building in Kenya! Without you this isn't possible!Like and share our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/plasticfantastickenyaFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/plasticfuntastyIf you have any questions or comments, please email us at plasticfantastickenya@gmail.comIf you want to contribute using M-Pesa, then use the following number: 0726 381 070And last, but not least, we have to give credit where credit is due. With such a crazy and interconnected world, there are people who have touched our hearts, books we've randomly happened to come across, and life experiences we've had (both good and bad) which, without, we wouldn't have the passion to have built Plastic Fantastic to where it is today. Thank you to Amani Institute, for without it, Jesah and Ciru would never have met, and the idea for Plastic Fantastic would have stayed just that - an idea. And, finally, thank you to our supporters, the people who believe in us, because without your belief this wouldn't be possible.Asante sana!!",9.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>I'm Wendy Fachon, Storywalker, writer, environmental educator and after-school walking club facilitator.</b> In an era dominated by highly-programmed electronic media, how many youth actually <i>know</i> how to play outdoors? As a parent and an independent educator, I've watched children become more programmed, less connected to their outside world, and less inclined to <b><i>active play</i>.</b>  This isolation poses serious health risks.  Furthermore, IF a child is secluded indoors and kept from <b><i>experiencing</i></b> nature, how can such a child truly appreciate and properly care for the environment? <br/></p>
<p>My project, <i><b>Wild Plant Magic Cards, </b></i>has the objective of encouraging more kids to shift from ""screen time"" to ""green time"" - get outdoors, exercise and have fun while they learn. The cards offer a simple and fun way to reconnect with nature. Wild plants grow everywhere, even in the city. These cards highlight the beauty, variety, value and magic of the plant kingdom... fascinating aspects that are not covered in a <i>standard </i>science curriculum<b>.<br/></b></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
I'm Wendy Fachon, Storywalker, writer, environmental educator and after-school walking club facilitator. In an era dominated by highly-programmed electronic media, how many youth actually know how to play outdoors? As a parent and an independent educator, I've watched children become more programmed, less connected to their outside world, and less inclined to active play.  This isolation poses serious health risks.  Furthermore, IF a child is secluded indoors and kept from experiencing nature, how can such a child truly appreciate and properly care for the environment? 
My project, Wild Plant Magic Cards, has the objective of encouraging more kids to shift from ""screen time"" to ""green time"" - get outdoors, exercise and have fun while they learn. The cards offer a simple and fun way to reconnect with nature. Wild plants grow everywhere, even in the city. These cards highlight the beauty, variety, value and magic of the plant kingdom... fascinating aspects that are not covered in a standard science curriculum.
For example: Do you know which weeds growing in your neighborhood are actually edible?


Can you identify Poison Ivy AND the wild plant will protect your skin from getting the itchy Poison Ivy rash?
Do you know how the Dandelion got its name?Hint: It is NOT named for the color and shape of its flower.
Wild Plant Magic Cards hold the answers inside.Story Cards, Clue Cards and Plant Cards offer stories, facts and play-based activities that teach children how to safely navigate the woods and fields outdoors. Kids love to go outdoors to play and explore, IF others will go out with them. The images and short text weave a mysterious web of information that inspires imaginative game play and nature detective adventures. 


What is my fundraising goal? $3,333. This is based on the costs for the printing and the perks. A limited number of original card sets are available for a $25 or $35 donation.
My colleague Gail Ahlers and I will be using these cards with over fifty elementary students in the city of Pawtucket's summer school program. These cards will help us enhance a computerized reading and math curriculum with arts, storywalking, plant studies and story writing.
If I raise more than my goal, I can produce more sets to give to the Rhode Island Wild Plant Society, RIEEA,, RIFIN and other environmental education organizations, as well as RIASPA and affiliated afterschool providers. If I earn well above my goal, maybe, I can also produce sets in Spanish.
What's in it for YOU besides some fun perks? 
Would you like to get some kids off the couch and convert their ''screen time"" into ""green time""? 
Would you like to see some children become more actively engaged with the natural world around them? 
Do you know some kids who might like to develop the skills of an environmental detective and help protect the plants and the pollinators that rely on the plants for survival?

<b><h3>Who Are We?</h3></b>
</div><div>
<p>Hi! We're volunteers for the Luckiamute Watershed Council -- some of us are landowners, some are scientists and technical experts, but all of us care about this  creek that runs through the communities of Dallas, Monmouth and Independence, Oregon, before entering the Willamette River.</p>
<p>We hope you care, too! Will you contribute to this project?</p>
<p>Why do we want to plant native trees, shrubs and flowers?</p>
<p>For decades, human activities have had harmful effects on Ash Creek, from dredging to dumping and development to ditching. One result of our impacts is non-native weeds have grown up along the creek and crowded out the native plants that would normally be there.</p>
<p><i><b>Please note:</b></i> When you contribute (thank you!), a message will appear that your contribution was received by the Marys River Watershed Council. As the fiscal sponsor to the Luckiamute Watershed Council, the Marys River WC receives and manages funds on our behalf. Rest assured, all contributions will be dedicated to the Ash Creek project. Call with any questions! 503-837-0237. Thank you!<br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<h3>What are we doing?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Luckiamute Watershed Council and our project partners have been hard at work clearing away these weeds and adding native plants. Your contribution will help us purchase more plants and pay professional restoration crews to plant and maintain them. Check out the perks!</span><br/></p>
<p>You may think this is just a matter of aesthetics, but it's more: Where there are native plants, there is shade for native fish. With a little care, Ash Creek could support the young fish that seek refuge in shady pools, as well as the birds, butterflies, bees, and other native animals that depend on native plants.</p>
<p>But wait! That's not all!</p>
<p>In the winter, when the Willamette River is high, its waters back up into Ash Creek, and it becomes a quiet refuge for fish from the raging river. In addition, a healthy creek helps those living downstream by holding back the flood waters, just a bit.</p>

<p>For India, conservation of biodiversity is crucial
not only because it provides several goods and services necessary for human

a benefit derived from biodiversity in India is reflected by the forest sector,
which is increasingly being looked upon as a major performer in poverty

<h3></h3>
<p>Waste is not just a problem, it is a globalized catastrophe that is not going away nor solving itself. Due to population increase and limited space, the dwindling supply and increasing demand of landfills will continue to increase costs and pose an extremely negative impact for future generations.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444931578/sdumltsg9olodjiubzn5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The United States produces 1/4 of the world’s waste, yet it has less than 5% of the population. Nationally, it is estimated that the non-residential sectors generate between 35 and 45% of all Material Solid Waste (MSW). The Race for Zero Waste is designed to assist corporations in the non-residential sector to achieve their sustainability goals in a more efficient and effective manner, but in a format that educates and energizes their employees to recycle every possible material.<br/></p>

<p>Green Purpose established the Race for Zero Waste competition in 2014 as a way to encourage, celebrate and maximize commercial recycling. Some of the world’s most reputable companies have participated in past two Race for Zero Waste competitions, including Kraft Foods, Rockwell Automation, The Libman Company and Dart Container Corporation. Throughout the competition, each participant implemented new ways to increase their recycling efforts for a chance to win the title of the most successful program and earn our esteemed Zero Waste Seal of Excellence. What’s really exciting is that all of the participants have collectively <b>diverted over 15 million pounds of materials</b>!</p>

<p>We are extremely proud of this accomplishment and are committed to expanding our Race for Zero Waste initiative in order to have a positive global impact on commercial waste generation.

</div></div>","Intro
Landfill space in America is dwindling, and Green Purpose is on a mission to conserve it through the Race for Zero Waste! With your help, we’re raising $50,000 by America Recycles Day (November 15, 2015) to help us continue raising awareness and keeping millions of pounds of recyclables out of landfills. 
As an Eco-Capitalist company, Green Purpose  excels at helping companies maximize the profitability of their recycling programs. With the exciting new Race for Zero Waste competition that we have developed, companies now have the opportunity to bring in higher recycling revenues and recycling rates than ever before! Throughout the competition, participating companies receive environmental credibility and the tools and resources necessary to achieve profitability, add value, and save money through recycling and Zero Waste practices. If you want to position yourself as a sustainability leader in your industry, then this is the competition for you. 











What Will Campaign Donations Go Towards? 
With your support, we will expand our Race for Zero Waste competition into a worldwide movement in which businesses and individuals can participate for a more sustainable future! Donations will go toward a wide range of things that will help us reach our goal, including: 
- Improving our internal platform so that we can have the biggest impact- Upgrading platform connectivity for both businesses and individuals to get involved in the Race for Zero Waste movement- Adding to our team of experts who will focus on developing advanced standards 
Lastly, a part of the funds will go towards building on to our successful internship program. We believe it's important to give interns from multiple fields of study an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with solving real-world issues. 

We're excited to announce that our Race for Zero Waste campaign is in partnership with Protect Our Winters, a cause that is very dear to us. 10% of ALL funds that are pledged to our crowdfunding campaign will be donated to POW! 



What Is Protect Our Winters?

Protect Our Winters (POW) is the leading environmental advocacy group for the winter sports community. Their focus is on educational initiatives and community-based activism in order to improve our overall environment for the snow-sports community and future generations. 






  What We Need  
In order to continue expanding our Race for Zero Waste initiative and reaching companies across the globe, we need your help raising $50,000 in 30 days. We have established a wide range of perks that you will receive in exchange for your generosity. Our amazing Race for Zero Waste judge, Olympic medalist Gretchen Bleiler, has joined us in raising awareness about this initiative. Because Gretchen has been so helpful, a percentage of the proceeds from this campaign will also go toward Protect Our Winters (POW), a powerful sustainability initiative that she passionately supports.




What You GetWe've compiled a wide range of exciting perks that you will receive in return for pledging your support! Here are a few of them: • A Race for Zero Waste recycling t-shirt


• Recycling bins labelled with the recycling bin sticker of your choice



• Color-coded recycling label stickers



• Our trademarked Green-o-Gram™ posters
     

We're constantly adding more perks, so make sure to check back often! 



The Impact

 

Waste is not just a problem, it is a globalized catastrophe that is not going away nor solving itself. Due to population increase and limited space, the dwindling supply and increasing demand of landfills will continue to increase costs and pose an extremely negative impact for future generations.


The United States produces 1/4 of the world’s waste, yet it has less than 5% of the population. Nationally, it is estimated that the non-residential sectors generate between 35 and 45% of all Material Solid Waste (MSW). The Race for Zero Waste is designed to assist corporations in the non-residential sector to achieve their sustainability goals in a more efficient and effective manner, but in a format that educates and energizes their employees to recycle every possible material.



Green Purpose established the Race for Zero Waste competition in 2014 as a way to encourage, celebrate and maximize commercial recycling. Some of the world’s most reputable companies have participated in past two Race for Zero Waste competitions, including Kraft Foods, Rockwell Automation, The Libman Company and Dart Container Corporation. Throughout the competition, each participant implemented new ways to increase their recycling efforts for a chance to win the title of the most successful program and earn our esteemed Zero Waste Seal of Excellence. What’s really exciting is that all of the participants have collectively diverted over 15 million pounds of materials!


We are extremely proud of this accomplishment and are committed to expanding our Race for Zero Waste initiative in order to have a positive global impact on commercial waste generation. We are asking for a total contribution of $50,000 in order to keep this momentum going. With your help, we can make a sustainable change for future generations.







Race for Zero Waste Hall of Fame
Green Purpose has launched two successful Race for Zero Waste competitions so far. Our inaugural Race for Zero Waste competition officially kicked off on America Recycles Day 2014 and was an extremely close race! It was so close, in fact, that two of the companies (Kraft Foods and Rockwell Automation) both ended up receiving the title of the Grand Prize Winner! 




Both Rockwell Automation and Kraft Foods Group did an exceptional job at engaging their associates in their recycling programs. In an effort to engage more employees, the two highly distinguished companies have made sustainability more relevant to everyday work and easier to opt in rather than opt out.






Both Rockwell Automation and Kraft Foods Group  also did an outstanding job of informing associates about their recycling programs through a variety of educational materials, resources and communication tools. In an effort to educate their associates, Rockwell has recently transformed one of the walls in their main entrance as their official Recycling Wall. The wall has ample information about their recycling metrics, including monthly reports on their annual recycling goals in order to inform associates about the progress of their recycling efforts.






Lastly, both Rockwell Automation and Kraft Foods Group have advanced recycling collection systems and processes that have maximized the efficiency of their recycling operations. Each facility is structured for ingesting materials that can be diverted from the landfill.








Other participants in the inaugural Race for Zero Waste competition did an amazing job as well! In return for their outstanding efforts, each company received their own Seal of Excellence:

MTD won an Employee Participation Seal of Excellence: 



Plastipak won a Collection Systems and Processes Seal of Excellence:

Now, worried by the rate that natural habitats are being lost across the UK and the battle many of our flower, insect and animal species are facing, I want to create a small safe haven in an area that's largely been stripped of vegetation and turned into prairie-like fields. </span></p>

</div></div>","I'm Geoff Wakeling, a plant lover, conservationist and wildlife enthusiast - and I want to plant a wildflower meadow. Why? Because with intensive farming stripping the land, we're losing native flora and fauna. Once they're gone, they're gone forever. Without many of them, such as bees, even our own existence as a species is put in danger. 
When my grandfather (a Suffolk farmer, born and bred) died, our family had to sell off the farm buildings. However, we kept as much as the farmland as possible and allowed the land to be managed by local growers in need of extra acreage. Now, worried by the rate that natural habitats are being lost across the UK and the battle many of our flower, insect and animal species are facing, I want to create a small safe haven in an area that's largely been stripped of vegetation and turned into prairie-like fields. 


As phase one, two thirds of the field will be sown. The upper third is being set aside for woodland expansion.

I'm determined to sow a meadow as the first phase of an ongoing project which also includes extending existing woodland, rescuing plant-choked ponds and reestablishing traditional British farmland hedgerows. With a little help from you, I can sow the entire field this spring, allowing wildlife and the entire ecosystem, to mature and benefit sooner. 
   How can you help?
This spring the first phase will begin, with the wildflower seeds being sown by hand; a process known as broadcasting. I have the field, I have the time, I have the funds for some seeds, and I have the determination......but I need £1,300 to sow the entire 1.5 acre field.
ANY donation is gratefully received as it means I can sow more seeds. A few pounds/dollars gets more flowers, and we have perks including wildflower postcards, cotton tote bags and even the chance to have your name engraved upon a bench in the field itself, so please take a look at what's on offer. 
A single meadow's impact
 You might not think that a tiny meadow in a remote part of Suffolk is going to have much environmental impact, but you'd be surprised. For the area, it'll have huge benefits, ensuring wildlife and flora can thrive undisturbed. Insects, such as bees and butterflies, will be able to find food and go on to pollinate the crops we rely on. AND, if this single meadow can gain funding and make people sit up and take notice, perhaps it'll encourage others to do something similar.
Help us spread the word....
 If you can donate, I'd be eternally grateful. If you can't, then don't worry as you can still help hugely by sharing our project on social media (there's some handy sharing options at the top of this page). You could even decided to plant a small wildflower patch yourself and improve your local area - that's what it's all really about!!
I run The Guide to Gay Gardening website, and you can also follow me on Twitter and Facebook where they'll be additional updates and fundraiser shoutouts. Thanks SO much for taking the time to read a little...let the Great Wildlife and Flower Meadow commence!

<p></p><p>My name is Julio, and
I am the CEO of an organization called CONSES in Cochabamba, Bolivia.  I
am a Bolivian civil engineer, and throughout my time living here ecological
awareness and proper sanitation has often been overlooked.  With the large
migration of rural populations to the city of Cochabamba in recent years, many
families lack access to proper sanitation and clean water.  Improper sanitation contributes to pollution and
dangerous health conditions, particularly in the most impoverished parts of the
city.  Since many communities lack access to a sewer system or septic
system, standalone ecological bathrooms have become a more feasible
solution.  Nevertheless, many people
still lack any appropriate bathroom facility, and the health consequences are
significant.  </p>
<p>Currently 40% of the people
in Cochabamba lack access to these basic services.  This overall
percentage, however, does not tell the whole story.  Many times there is complete sanitary sewer
service coverage in the wealthier parts of the city, while impoverished
communities have little to no adequate sanitation infrastructure.  Due to the lack of these services, the
children get many different gastrointestinal diseases that produce diarrhea.
 As a result, many children die before they are 5 years old.  The infant
mortality rate (under 1 year of age) for all of Bolivia is roughly 7 times the
rate in the United States.  In
communities lacking proper sanitation and clean water, the rate can be <b>as much as</b> <b>20 times the infant mortality rate in United States.</b> Thus, the
people in Cochabamba who suffer from this lack of access to proper sanitation
and clean water typically must pay 5 to 10 times the average cost to have water
delivered by trucks from other areas.  </p>
<p>Fortunately, there is
a way you can help us <span>flush
away the pollution and improve health conditions.  I have partnered
with a civil engineer from the United States, Jason Obergfell, and together we
have worked on developing innovative ways to make ecological bathrooms more
economical and effective.  Jason has
worked on water and basic sanitation projects in Bolivia for over 8 years.  Our experience has helped us identify ways to
improve upon the ecological bathroom options that are currently used.  The funds we are raising will be used to buy
the mold for producing our new composting toilet model made of high strength
plastic.  Each time plastic is injected into the mold, it will produce
another new toilet for an ecological bathroom.  The mold will be used to
help form the toilet seat, the urine separator, the chamber that will hold a storage
receptacle, and the ventilation system.  Your contribution can assist us
in taking </span><b>this integral step </b>to providing new composting toilets to more
people in impoverished communities within Cochabamba.</p>
<p>Since its foundation,
our organization, CONSES, has designed new models of composting toilets for
ecological bathrooms at a low cost while using new materials friendly to the
environment.  This has addressed the treatment and utilization of the
treated waste for fertilizer in less than 2 months.  Many of the families
that enjoy the benefits of our ecological sanitation training workshops and
composting toilets regularly give positive feedback.  Overall, CONSES and
other organizations in Cochabamba have already launched public outreach
campaigns to more than 20% of people in the marginalized areas of Cochabamba to
familiarize people with ecological bathrooms.</p>
<p>Moreover, many
experiences in my life have influenced my work.  For example, I once met a
family in which the mother was blind and the father had a very bad back from
working in mining near Potosi. Therefore, we resolved these issues when we
modified the design of the ecological bathroom by building appropriate stairs
and railing for this family.  Thus, this prompted us to establish CONSES
to improve these designs for elderly people, children and disabled persons
who have problems in having proper sanitation and clean water.  With your
help, we can continue assisting the various poor communities of Cochabamba by
using new funds to buy a mold that will help us construct a new compositing
toilet and provide proper sanitation to many.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>In the green area of
Cochabamba, there is a lot of potable and clean water.  In the yellow area, there is some water, but
it is limited.  In the large red area of
Cochabamba, there is no potable or clean water in this poor area of the city.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438096609/avh0xsw1ukmjbgi5zs90.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>The Better Option: 
</b></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>With your help, we can
use the funds to obtain a mold that will be used numerous times to economically
create more composting toilets for ecological bathrooms.</p>
<p>Additionally, the
current bunker model for composting toilets in Bolivia and many parts of the
developing world includes a small room made of brick, two chambers for compost,
and the actual toilet itself.  This bunker model has several disadvantages
to our proposed model:   </p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span><b>Cost:</b> The bunker model requires a huge monetary
investment, in relative terms. The bunker model often requires over a thousand
dollars to construct.  Because of these high price tags, many of the
families who need composting toilets the most, the poor who live outside the
range of sewer services, cannot afford to build composting toilets.</p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span><b>Portability:</b> The bunker model is not portable for poorer
communities that always face the risk of having to move.  Often in poor
communities, there is no housing stability and communities move
frequently.  Fortunately, the new model is portable and more flexible than
the bunker. For households that do not have the space to construct a separate
latrine outside, they can simply utilize a space within their existing home. 
This portable toilet model also allows families to bring their composting toilet
with them and not lose their investment.</p>
<p>3.<span> 
</span><b>Reliability:</b> Furthermore, the new model allows people that
have existing toilets and bathrooms to more easily convert their toilet to a
composting toilet. In the bunker model, there is hardly a constant flow of composted
material. Human waste must remain in the composting chambers for six to eight
months. This means that there is not always fertilizer easily available. With
the new model, there is a more constant flow of material and therefore it is a
more reliable source of fertilizer. As a result, access to cleaner water has
become a more attainable reality, since these dry ecological toilets improve
the sanitation practices through providing poorer families with more basic
services.</p>
<p>4.<span> 
</span><b>Recycling:</b> Lastly, the new model can be constructed
entirely of recycled materials. While the bunker model is not incredibly
unsustainable, it still requires new bricks, sand, concrete, and metal. The new
model can be made of various grades of recycled plastics. With this model, your
empty plastic water bottle could become someone’s path to better health as an
ecological toilet.  </p>
<p>Fortunately, given the
strong history of CONSES of working with composting toilets and ecological
bathrooms, our organization is incredibly capable of promoting and constructing
more ecological bathrooms with the innovative composting toilets that will be
produced with the mold that you can help us create with your contribution.  Together, we will be able to more
economically and effectively address the root causes of health-threatening
pollution in the communities that need it most.</p><p><br/></p>

In the past year, GWE kids have spoken with elected officials on the local, state, and national level, organized letter writing campaigns, and helped their own schools adopt sustainable initiatives. In the coming year, they plan to bring reusable bags to Santa Fe, launch a kids' radio show on sustainability, and give their chapter book about the impacts of climate change to President Obama.
James Hansen, eminent climate scientist, told the GWE kids, “tell all the kids not to be afraid of climate change.”  They're not afraid – in fact, they're raring to go!

This organization was started by kids.  We are following their lead.



Here's what they've done during the past 2 school years:
Written

Wrote and illustrated a chapter book for kids on climate change (seeking a publisher) 

Wrote letters to the editor, the Secretary General of the UN, and President Obama 

Organized a letter-writing campaign against unsustainable palm oil production

Advocated


Testified at the EPA hearings on coal in Denver (sponsored by the Sierra Club)
Participated in the NYC Climate March
Pushed the Santa Fe City Council to ban plastic bags and charge 10¢ for paper bags.
Organized their own Keystone Pipeline rally
Held a seat on the Mayor's Climate Action Task Force


Learned and taught

Partnered with Santa Fe Public Schools on green initiatives and sustainability actions, including a composting program and a low carbon footprint lunch program
Requested and secured approval and funding for a solar installation at the original GWE elementary school
Held a two-week climate change summer camp
Formed a bi-lingual Green Team to teach custodians how and why to recycle




Elementary School Solar Panels -  Advocating, planning, measuring, and testifying for solar panels at Acequia Madre Elementary school.

Global Warming Express Book - Now 12 years old, GWE founders Marina Weber (writer) and Joanna Whysner (illustrator) are finishing their book on climate change, The Global Warming Express, with hopes of presenting it to President Obama.

Reusable Bags - GWE is partnering with Mujeres de Adelante and Warehouse 21 to create reusable bags for residents and visitors of Santa Fe.

Radio Broadcasts - GWE is partnering with KSFR radio to start a GWE Sustainability Show with the GWE middle schoolers.

Paris Climate Conference 2015 – Sponsorship for at least one GWE student to attend the conference is in place, how many more could we send?








Every kid is a superhero. Here’s how the superheroes tackle this issue.
1. Learn - Kids are hungry for information, but don’t always have access to it. GWE offers a foundation in climate education. This includes:

climate science literacy
sustainability awareness
natural sciences




2. Feel - The kids feel many things in reaction to what they learn. They might feel sad, frustrated, inspired, excited...  These feelings allow the kids to brainstorm and think creatively about how they want to respond.
3. Act - Students gain opportunities to act through:

public speaking training
research and writing
visual arts
performance skills




We have to do this quickly. After school classes start just as this campaign ends! 
Schools all over Santa Fe are on a waiting list for GWE, and our curriculum is ready to be packed up for schools that wish to replicate our programs around the country.
These goals are just to get us started for the coming school year.
Our goals and how to get there:


Continue and expand our programs in Santa Fe schools.


Establish our curriculum for other schools to bring this program to their own area. You can create your own GWE!

Finish and publish the kid's climate change chapter book, and get it to President Obama.

Continue advocacy by going to climate events and talking with elected officials.

Pay our teachers to run the after-school programs.

To accomplish all of these reachable and essential goals we have both a Kids Board of Directors and an Adult Board of Directors. Kids make decisions on policy and advocacy, while the grown-ups organize behind the scenes.

</p>
<p><br/>Paseo de los Monos is a wildlife shelter located near the city of Puyo in the province of Pastaza, Ecuador. The refuge has one hectare of native forest and has been receiving orphaned wild animal, the victims of trafficking, since 2005.<br/></p>
<p></p>Their first goal is to offer the animals a new family in an adequate space appropriate to their natural mode of life. The animals here are living inside big parks of native vegetation.<br/><br/>The refuge shelters species in critical danger of extinction, for example primates like:<br/><br/>Woolly monkeys (Laothrix poepiggi) and Spider monkeys (Ateles Belzebuth) which are intensively hunted for human consumption, while the babies are sold in towns or cities.<br/><br/>Monkey meat is considered a delicacy in some regions. Sadly, these animals have a relatively short life expectancy and their rate of reproduction is very low: they live until 25 years old and can only have one baby every two or three years.<br/><br/><h3>They reproduce at the same rate as they are killed.</h3>

<br/>The three spider monkeys that live in Paseo de los Monos are the only animals that don´t have a suitable place which means they have to live in a large cage.<br/><br/>It is imperative we get them a piece of land with trees where they can move freely.<br/><br/>Other non-primate species that are under threat are also welcome at the wildlife shelter including:<br/><h4>

<p>In 2014 they built the first serpentarium of the province with the aim of rescuing snakes which are found near houses or in perilous situations trying to avoid the highways.

<h3>The Destruction of the Amazon</h3>
<div></div>
<p><span>In  2013 the massive destruction of the Amazon from Brazil to Ecuador started. </span></p>
<p><b><i>The oil and mining companies and agricultural farming are incrementing their activities and as a result the forests are being fragmented.</i> </b></p>
<p>This is a hard situation for the wildlife, since they are not able to follow their ancestral paths in order to find food and shelter. </p>
<p>The agony of the tropical forests are the first cause of extinction of animal and vegetable species which are necessary to preserve the fragile ecosystems of which we are part. </p>
<p><b>The more vulnerable will be disappear first, and if the destruction of the ¨Lungs of the World¨ goes on, all life will be endangered including humans.</b></p>
<p>The construction of highways, poaching, traffic of wildlife, the illegal trade of wood, development of places for human necessities like houses, fields for cropping and farming etc, will provoke the extinction of the forests and the contamination of the <b>principal water resources. </b></p>For this we are working with The Paseo de los Monos, those involved in the reception and rehabilitation of animals in unnatural conditions and / or in danger of extinction in Puyo. </div><div style=""text-align: center;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441059433/kxrzdz9eastjeqeej5tg.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 502.069px; height: 336px;""/></p></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Our Goal and What We Need </h3>
<div></div>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the beginning,
the goal was to shelter and rehabilitate orphan animals in order to
form groups with them and free them into protected areas. </p>
<p>It is
important to preserve these rescued animals as a genetic resource and
their reproduction will allow them to re-inhabit the devastated zones
in the future. 
</p>In order to achieve
this goal, the members of Paseo de los Monos are trying to get a land
of virgin forest at the borders of Parque Nacional Sangay of 50 hectares. </span>
</div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>The land will be preserved and the animals who have been
rehabilitated can be liberated in this protected area. This
will allow Paseo de los Monos to shelter more wild animals who are
being currently victims of traffic and dispersed in cities or zoos
under poor conditions, chained or in cages. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Once the animals are
back into their habitat, they will be able to achieve their role in
nature, which is the dispersion of seed and preserve the equilibrium

<p>This year we’re hoping to take a stand and lead the way in environmental promotion, actively encouraging less waste in Ibiza by providing participating venues with photographic canvases that allow people to download flyers instead of using promotional posters. </p>

PASEO DE LOS MONOS
ANIMAL RESCUE CENTRE  - Puyo, Amazonas, Ecuador
http://www.losmonos.org/
Our Aim is to To raise $36,000 to help a wildlife shelter acquire a patch of Amazon rainforest in Ecuador for nature conservation and to rehabilitate animals into the wild.

Véronique Grand and Yvan Bouvier, of swiss nationality, went to live in the Ecuadorian Amazonia in 2002. As many, they were worried for the environment and the treatment toward the animals. 
In the 2007 they created the Swiss-Ecuadorian foundation “Los Monos, Selva y Vida” which is devoted to the conservation of the fauna, the flora and the amazon indigenous traditions.
Illegal hunters and poachers are leaving thousands of orphaned animals destined to be sold as pets or toys. They sadly end their lives in cages, tied up, mistreated or in laboratories.
The Ecuadorian Amazonia has the biggest biodiversity in the world and we should take action now.
Activities of “Paseo de los Monos”


Paseo de los Monos is a wildlife shelter located near the city of Puyo in the province of Pastaza, Ecuador. The refuge has one hectare of native forest and has been receiving orphaned wild animal, the victims of trafficking, since 2005.
Their first goal is to offer the animals a new family in an adequate space appropriate to their natural mode of life. The animals here are living inside big parks of native vegetation.The refuge shelters species in critical danger of extinction, for example primates like:Woolly monkeys (Laothrix poepiggi) and Spider monkeys (Ateles Belzebuth) which are intensively hunted for human consumption, while the babies are sold in towns or cities.Monkey meat is considered a delicacy in some regions. Sadly, these animals have a relatively short life expectancy and their rate of reproduction is very low: they live until 25 years old and can only have one baby every two or three years.They reproduce at the same rate as they are killed.



(Woolly Monkey, Jack)
The three spider monkeys that live in Paseo de los Monos are the only animals that don´t have a suitable place which means they have to live in a large cage.It is imperative we get them a piece of land with trees where they can move freely.Other non-primate species that are under threat are also welcome at the wildlife shelter including:
White and Black
capuchins (Cebus albifrons and Cebus apella)Squirrel monkeys
(Saimiri sciureus)Tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis) 


Also welcome are other species which are  as important as primates and largely killed
as well as : Coaties (Nasua nasua)Guatusas (amazonic rodents)Marguay (carnivor feline), TurtlesSnakes (Boa constrictor and Vipers).

In 2014 they built the first serpentarium of the province with the aim of rescuing snakes which are found near houses or in perilous situations trying to avoid the highways. Before this project existed, people killed these animals in order to avoid a potential danger. So far 19 snakes have been rescued and are ready to be liberated into a national park far from the cities..



The Destruction of the Amazon

In  2013 the massive destruction of the Amazon from Brazil to Ecuador started. 
The oil and mining companies and agricultural farming are incrementing their activities and as a result the forests are being fragmented. 
This is a hard situation for the wildlife, since they are not able to follow their ancestral paths in order to find food and shelter. 
The agony of the tropical forests are the first cause of extinction of animal and vegetable species which are necessary to preserve the fragile ecosystems of which we are part. 
The more vulnerable will be disappear first, and if the destruction of the ¨Lungs of the World¨ goes on, all life will be endangered including humans.
The construction of highways, poaching, traffic of wildlife, the illegal trade of wood, development of places for human necessities like houses, fields for cropping and farming etc, will provoke the extinction of the forests and the contamination of the principal water resources. For this we are working with The Paseo de los Monos, those involved in the reception and rehabilitation of animals in unnatural conditions and / or in danger of extinction in Puyo. 
Our Goal and What We Need 



In the beginning,
the goal was to shelter and rehabilitate orphan animals in order to
form groups with them and free them into protected areas. 
It is
important to preserve these rescued animals as a genetic resource and
their reproduction will allow them to re-inhabit the devastated zones
in the future. 
In order to achieve
this goal, the members of Paseo de los Monos are trying to get a land
of virgin forest at the borders of Parque Nacional Sangay of 50 hectares. 

The land will be preserved and the animals who have been
rehabilitated can be liberated in this protected area. This
will allow Paseo de los Monos to shelter more wild animals who are
being currently victims of traffic and dispersed in cities or zoos
under poor conditions, chained or in cages. 



Once the animals are
back into their habitat, they will be able to achieve their role in
nature, which is the dispersion of seed and preserve the equilibrium
of the ecosystems.

                                                         (Spider Monkey)PLAN BIf the $35,000 goal is not met, Plan B is to build a new sanctuary for the 3 Spider Monkeys, who are the first in need of a more suitable place to live. This is will be in an area of 40 hectares of natural forest hosted by Jungle Dave, an Eco-Tourism operator in the area of San Juan Bosco that offer eco-tours, organic farming and are large supporters and funders of environmental education.
Plan B also promotes excellent future collaboration prospects with Paseo de Los Monos. http://www.jungledavestours.com/Pages/SJB/SJB.html



Risks & Challenges


 The price of land surrounding the National Parks in Ecuador has skyrocketed up to 20 times more than what it was just a few years ago, leaving Paseo de Los Monos without the necessary means to purchase any land.With the help of this crowd funding we hope this will once again become a possibility!




More About The Nature Project...
http://thezooproject.com/thenatureproject





The Nature Project was created through an alliance with ¨Paseo de Los Monos¨,  ¨Proartso, Spain¨ and ¨The Zoo Project, Ibiza¨
We are a non-profit organization that promotes and manages strategies for the preservation of the animal ecosystem, wildlife and the cultures that exert effort to preserve it.

The Zoo Project have a long history of collaborating with various local and global charities and The Nature Project represents the latest step on a collaborative journey that has seen us raise money and awareness with the likes of 
Ibiza Diu No
Duo
Care4Cats
Last Night A DJ Saved My Life
Green Heart Foundation.

This year our Nature Project fundraising team have been busy at The Zoo Project each and every Saturday engaging with the party people to inform them about the plight of the Amazon rainforest and its inhabitants as well as raising money for the cause through donations.
                                                                        
So far we’ve raised over €3000 at the Zoo alone so please chip in and help us help as many animals as possible!
For every euro we fundraise during the events - The Zoo Project as our main sponsor will match that amount to put towards the conservation plan!
                                                                     
                              

                                                              (Guacuamayo)

Finally, Ibiza is known for the vast amount of posters and flyers produced on a daily basis as promotional tools for the island’s many bars and clubs. 
This year we’re hoping to take a stand and lead the way in environmental promotion, actively encouraging less waste in Ibiza by providing participating venues with photographic canvases that allow people to download flyers instead of using promotional posters. 
Many participating bars and clubs around the island will boast one of these amazing photographic artworks, all funded by The Zoo Project in order to bring awareness to the project.

<h4>A Look At Our Future</h4>
<p>Rare microbial communities live at the base of a glacier, where the ice touches the underlying lava rock, and steam fumaroles emit gases that provide nutrients for these microbes. Astrobiologists study these life forms to see how things might grow in space for our future colonization efforts. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

</div></div>","MISSION CRITICAL
Glaciers are retreating at an alarming rate - taking with them valuable scientific information. You can help this non-profit team of expert volunteers gather data before it's too late.

Why This Matters
 


Glaciers are universally-accepted indicators of climate change and global warming. Most glaciers have crevasses, but fewer have complex cave systems. These caves offer an extraordinary x-ray view into the internal workings of a glacier. Glacier Cave Explorers pioneers new ways to collect valuable data from under the ice, before these unique scientific laboratories disappear completely. 
Glacier Cave Explorers team in the cavernous Godzilla Cave deep under the crater glacier on Mt St Helens, an active volcano

Most glacier research is conducted from the surface – from the top down. Our team studies glaciers from beneath the ice – from the inside out.This research helps climatologists and glaciologists better understand how air currents and temperature within glacier caves can impact the characteristics of a glacier. By mapping the caves' physical changes, our team can track the glacier ice volume lost. In addition to climatology and geomorphology, this research contributes to a host of other scientific disciplines, including geochemistry, microbiology and astrobiology. These extreme environments simulate conditions found under ice packs on other bodies in our solar system, like Mars and Europa. The life forms found in these caves can provide valuable insight about possible microbial life ""out there.""  Read more about Dr. Roberto Anitori's extremophile research in glacier caves.Scientists use this data for their specific area of research, building a more accurate picture of our changing climate and glaciers, the chemical changes in volcanic soil and rock, and what we might find on other planets. 


Dr. Woody Peeples, M.D. (the expedition medical doctor) takes an ice density reading in East Crater summit caves on Mt Rainier. One of our 2016 goals is to buy an ice corer, which will provide more accurate ice density readings than the displacement method shown above.

What Does This Mean To You?

A Look At Our Past
Glacier caves reveal the many layers of ice that have accumulated over the centuries. They are like tree rings - the chemical make-up of the ice layer provides a literal ""blueprint"" of what was happening in the atmosphere that year. 
Glaciers are HISTORY BOOKS of climate. By learning about our past, we understand how to deal with the future, learn what to expect, and how not to repeat the same mistakes. As the glaciers disappear, we lose more and more pages of climate history. 
Watershed Impact
When glaciers disappear, so does their water. By finding out why our ice packs are disappearing and how the caves are influencing that, we become better informed about protecting them or planning for the consequences. 



Dr. Andreas Pflitsch throws a data logger chain into Adelie Lake on Mt Rainier as his assistant Dave Holmgren watches. The data logger chain records temperature readings at various depths in the water. 


Saving LivesThe cave maps we generate can be used by search and rescue teams to locate and extract lost and injured cavers and climbers. 

Lead cave surveyor Scott Linn takes field notes in the crater glacier caves on Mt St Helens. 


Millions of people live in the shadows of volcanoes. Our research can also help provide data to predict future destructive behavior and alert potential victims.



3-dimensional maps provide context for scientific readings and collections - data from different disciplines can be studied in relation to each other. The maps show changes in the caves, such as new moulins and retreating entrances.  
Natural Resource Management

We provide follow-up reports and information to help develop resource management and interpretive tools for the Forest Service and National Parks in charge of wilderness areas.
A Look At Our Future
Rare microbial communities live at the base of a glacier, where the ice touches the underlying lava rock, and steam fumaroles emit gases that provide nutrients for these microbes. Astrobiologists study these life forms to see how things might grow in space for our future colonization efforts.

Support Our Scientific Mission
We need your help funding our 2016-2017 expeditions.

This work isn't easy or cheap - our volunteer experts need supplies and gear.

The glacier caves are remote and difficult to access, and these expeditions are complex. Our projects require the same level of care, detail and planning as you'd find on a Himalayan expedition. 
Even though we donate our time, we need supplies to live and work in these inhospitable places. 
We need survival and rescue gear, medical supplies, specialized science equipment, lab analysis of samples, helicopters, volcanic gas monitors, satellite phones, breathing apparatus, and expedition-quality food and tents. This all adds up. 

Mt St Helens team hauls gear to Godzilla Hole for the first descent and initial cave survey. Cave 2 is in the background (below the climbers).
As we've become more successful with our expeditions, more scientists have expressed interest in this research. Glacier Cave Explorers provides the expedition structure as well as the caving, rescue and alpine expertise to get scientists and support teams into these extreme locations. Most scientists can't make the trips themselves. That's why we often collect data for them under their remote guidance, following their strict methods. 
Glacier Cave Explorers is continuing to
integrate more disciplines of science and grow the scope and depth of our
studies. This is good for the research and exciting for us. But by expanding our projects and by increasing their complexity, our costs are increasing as well.

Most people can't do this work. These caves are remote, dangerous and undocumented, and these expeditions require a rare combination of skill-sets... mountaineering, glaciology, cave survey, ice-climbing, rope rigging, science methodology, wilderness medicine, expedition logistics planning, and more. 
To meet our team, check out our Gallery tab, our Facebook page, and the glaciercaveexplorers.org website.

Our Projects
Our projects are ongoing scientific studies.  We currently have study sites on Mt Hood, Mt St Helens and Mt Rainier. All of these projects require research and wilderness permits, many volunteer hours, and funding. 
The scientific value is in obtaining data points and monitoring changes over time. In 2016, we plan to return to Mt Rainier and Mt Hood. In 2017, we will conduct our second Mt St Helens expedition. These projects represent three distinct and complementary types of glaciers - receding, growing, and balanced.

Risks and Challenges

We work in incredibly challenging scientific venues in some of the most remote locations on earth... not just at altitude on the side of a glacier, but under a moving ice pack. Add the threat of avalanches, underground ice collapse, falling rocks, toxic volcanic gases and glacial flooding, and this is frontier work in uncharted territory. 
Mountains make their own weather, and helicopter-based rescues are often not possible. We have to be completely self-reliant. We need our own rescue teams above and below ground, field hospitals, and the ability to manage mountain illness and wilderness trauma. 
Glacier Cave Explorers includes Mountain Rescue Association (MRA) qualified rescue leaders, trained cave rescue experts from the National Cave Rescue Commission (NCRC), mountain expedition doctors and paramedics, logistics specialists and experienced expedition leaders. 


Expedition leader Eddy Cartaya uses the satellite phone during theMt St Helens 2014 expedition. The sat phone provides vital safety communications with the outside world and a way to check the weather forecast throughout the day. Conditions change quickly. 



Where Your Money Goes

Your contributions go into one big 'bucket' for all of our projects, along with any additional funds we receive from grants. If we receive the helicopter permit, the 2016 Mt Rainier expedition will cost approximately $30,000. Sandy Glacier on Mt Hood will cost around $5000, and Mt St Helens in 2017 approximately $10,000. These are minimum amounts to make these expeditions happen.

Past and Present Supporters



The first two years, Brent and Eddy paid out-of-pocket for these expeditions. Over time, Glacier Cave Explorers and the Oregon High Desert Grotto developed relationships resulting in much-needed grants, discounts and donations. As much as we appreciate grants, they do not cover all of the expenses. Grants can be unpredictable, and only a few are available for this type of work. That's why we need to pursue other types of funding, such as crowdfunding. 

Read more about sponsors... 


Research Permits
We've received essential cooperation from the Forest Service and National Park Service. They read our study proposals and approve the permits necessary to do this work in public land under their jurisdiction. We honor their trust and work hard to manage and minimize our human impact in these fragile, protected places. 


Media Coverage and Links
News and media organizations have documented our work and helped educate the public about our projects:  Oregon Public Broadcasting's Oregon Field Guide TV shows (Mt Hood,  Mt St Helens), National Parks Conservation Association magazine,  the Seattle Times newspaper, NSS News, National Geographic, TEDYouth Talks, Smithsonian Magazine, MRA's Meridian magazine, the Columbian.

<h3>Who are we and why Ukraine?</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/laeoukraine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Lawrence Anthony Earth Organization Ukraine (LAEOU)</a>, headed up by Director, Lionel de Lange, a South African living in Ukraine has been active in rescuing, relocating and assisting zoo's and abused wildlife in Ukraine since 2014.</p>
<p>Ukraine's animal rights are virtually non-existent and most laws governing animals are the same laws that existed in the Soviet Union days. We work hard to try and change this and to give these creatures a more humane way of life. And as we say ""BECAUSE NONE SURVIVE ALONE"" we are there each and every day to make a change and a life more livable.</p>
<h3>The story of Nathan and the 3 lionesses, Luca, Charlie &amp; Kai</h3>
<p><strong><i>It is critical we move them before winter sets in as they do not have a heated shelters and that will be very expensive to build for the 2 separate enclosures as Nathan and the lionesses are not housed together.</i></strong></p>
<p align=""left""><strong>NATHAN</strong> - rescued by Lionel, Director of The Lawrence Anthony Earth Organization - Ukraine from an evil animal trader and animal circus trainer in Ukraine. Nathan and his sister were taken from their parents at about 2 months old and were to be sold to a circus, private zoo or even as a pet. Fortunately, we were able to get Nathan out but his sister mysteriously disappeared, and unfortunately probably sold to one of the aforementioned places.</p>

<p align=""left"">Nathan was then dumped in a concrete and steel cage of +/-15m², he was never able to explore, go outside, or even just enjoy the simple pleasure of lazing in the sun! Lionel and his team have since built a temporary enclosure for him to explore until we start with the relocation. Nathan is coming back to South Africa to live his life outside, freely and just be all he needs to be….. a lion.</p>

<p align=""left""><strong>LUCA, CHARLIE &amp; KAI</strong> – Were found when Lionel was doing a 3 brown bear rescue and relocation from a privately owned zoo (if you can even call it that) in Sambir, Ukraine. The bears were relocated to a bear sanctuary in Synevir in the Carpathian Mountains. However, Lionel could not leave the 3 lionesses to live in the squalid conditions they were in. Their enclosure was only 35m² of concrete and steel cage. No direct sunlight, no fresh air, no enrichment, just filth. He managed to negotiate and secure their release into his care. He was able to raise some funds and build them a temporary enclosure while prepping them for their trip to their forever home in South Africa. They are loving their temporary enclosure spend lots of time playing with the enrichment, stalking each other and lazing in the sun. Its their first chance in life to be lions and it was amazing to see the change in them from being caged to having the run of a 280m² enclosure.</p>

<p><strong>Winter</strong> is just around the corner and we do not wish to waste the funds we have to turn their night shelters in heated rooms as it would eat up the funds we do have. We have also only budgeted on food until end of September but will need to extend this and this is also another reason to move them soonest as we do not wish to use the travel funding for feeding but its what we will need to do if we are not able to fly towards end of October.</p>

<p>Between 3 or 4 people can be put together a

<p><b>Advantages</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Size:</b>  it Has 8x6 m (48 m2) using 8
bamboo 8 m long. </p>
<p><b>Easy
to make:</b> The reeds/bamboo can be cut with common
tools that the farmers have: machete, ax, hammer and if there is, chainsaw. </p>
<p><b>Ventilation:</b> the ceiling is high -3.5 meters-, which allows ventilation, and in
almost all the space an adult can stand up.</p>
<p><b>It
allows collecting water:</b> In the lateral gutters a
PVC tube will be place to drain water that can be keep in water tanks to use
the water from the rain that can also be mineralize to make it drinkable. </p>
<p><b>It
is durable:</b> The plastic greenhouse and buried
bamboo can last for at least three years, as we know the reality is that it
will take many years to rebuilt all the homes that have been destroyed. </p>
<p><b>Improvable:</b>  you can add walls recycled
wood or bamboo / bamboo floor etc. so it can be converted into a temporary
house.</p>
<p><b>Solid:</b> The structure is strong and allows, for example, hanging hammocks.</p>
<p><b>Standardized:</b> they can be prepared in large quantities because standard measures are
being used: rods plastic 8 meters and 6 meters wide. Although plastic, may vary
in width. Common trucks can carry rods up to 8 m, with drawers 6 m long. </p>
<p><b>Scalable</b> from different properties that have bamboo and are located near the
affected area kits to build them can be sent. </p>
<p><b>Modular:</b> the kits can be attached to larger structures such as schools or
medical clinics</p><p><b>The Team :)</b> </p><p>Project creators and leaders, Manuel and Cristina </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461244749/manuel_y_cris_qk6xvx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>

the community so they can also build them by themselves) 






Characteristics of the
Design and time to build: 
Between 3 or 4 people can be put together a
shelter in 2 or 3 hours
Advantages

Size:  it Has 8x6 m (48 m2) using 8
bamboo 8 m long. 
Easy
to make: The reeds/bamboo can be cut with common
tools that the farmers have: machete, ax, hammer and if there is, chainsaw. 
Ventilation: the ceiling is high -3.5 meters-, which allows ventilation, and in
almost all the space an adult can stand up.
It
allows collecting water: In the lateral gutters a
PVC tube will be place to drain water that can be keep in water tanks to use
the water from the rain that can also be mineralize to make it drinkable. 
It
is durable: The plastic greenhouse and buried
bamboo can last for at least three years, as we know the reality is that it
will take many years to rebuilt all the homes that have been destroyed. 
Improvable:  you can add walls recycled
wood or bamboo / bamboo floor etc. so it can be converted into a temporary
house.
Solid: The structure is strong and allows, for example, hanging hammocks.
Standardized: they can be prepared in large quantities because standard measures are
being used: rods plastic 8 meters and 6 meters wide. Although plastic, may vary
in width. Common trucks can carry rods up to 8 m, with drawers 6 m long. 
Scalable from different properties that have bamboo and are located near the
affected area kits to build them can be sent. 
Modular: the kits can be attached to larger structures such as schools or
medical clinicsThe Team :) Project creators and leaders, Manuel and Cristina

<h3>Most of the planet is not cities </h3>

<p>Their fish is full of plastic, the livestock eats it and gets sick, and even if they get exposed to campaigns and information about plastic pollution, it is to a large degree simply too external to take in and understand.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Short Summary</span><br/>
</h3> <p>We are a team of professionals interested in the prehistoric exploration of Artsakh and the rest of the Armenian Highlands. This current cave project aims to contribute to the scientific wealth of the area through the extensive excavation work in a virgin Paleolithic cave that has not been disturbed.  We have already done preliminary work within this site and found strong evidence on its scientific potential in terms of early human colonization and the overall environment at this period of time.  Because this cave is located in Artsakh, the lack of international recognition makes formal funding impossible, and the individual contributions of interested participants is the only way we can secure this wealth of research and scientific discovery awaiting us. Each contribution and the word of mouth spread by people about this project is invaluable to ultimately place Artsakh as an important center of scientific inquiry and discovery.  Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<p>   The project head, Professor Levon Yepiskoposyan, is extensively involved in the field of human population genetics and paleontology, and has been a local partner of the internationally conducted excavations in the famous paleolithic cave of Azokh (also in Artsakh), since 2002.  Levon graduated from Moscow State University with a degree in anthropology and has a doctorate of science in the field of genetics. He has numerous published works in international scientific journals.  From 1995-1996, he was the rector of Arstakh State University.  Currently, he's leading the Ethnogenomics Lab in the Institute of Molecular Biology, Armenian National Academy of Sciences. Levon has been collecting DNA samples from both modern Armenians, and ancient DNA from burials in Armenia and Artsakh that extent to the Neolithic period. Under his guidance, the first ever extensive Genetic Map of Historical Armenia is currently in development, which can be accessed by the general public.</p>
<p>   Team member Peter Hrechdakian is the volunteer administrator of the Armenian DNA Project at Family Tree DNA.  Using the latest genetic tools, he seeks to understand how the diverse Armenian genetic pool was affected by broad historical processes such as invasions, migrations, wars, forced population transfers, natural catastrophes, etc. and also subtle historical processes such as admixture, conversion, micro-migration… He has given a number of lectures and conferences on the subject.  Peter has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and Philosophy from Cornell University (Ithaca, New York) and a Masters in Business Administration degree from Harvard Business School (Boston, Massachussetts). He lives between Brussels, Belgium and Beirut, Lebanon. Peter has already contributed financially to the preliminary survey and exploration of the Alexana Cave in 2015.</p>
<p>  Armen Martirosian is a physician and scientist focused on the origin of the Armenian population.  He currently lives in Yerevan, but hails from Honolulu Hawaii.  He has a Bachelor of Science in pre-medical studies from Hawaii Pacific University, and has continued his medical education in Armenia.  He has been a physical anthropology consultant on a recently uncovered archaeological site (the Necropolis of Karmir Blur) in Yerevan and has participated in DNA collection from rural areas of Armenia.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The necessary funding for our project is at $40,000, which is the cost required <span style=""background-color: initial;"">to cover all expenses related to the excavations
in Alexana Cave.  This will cover the July-August 2016 period which will include 10 team members, 5 local assistants, a driver,
housing, meals, equipment, conservation of finds, and local transportation during
the course of ~3 weeks.  We will post updates during the field work, and will include regular posts that you can follow on Facebook or via other social media.  You are welcome to join us and participate, even virtually in our excavation and other areas of our scientific activities.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The available perks are numerous, particularly via the personal exploration of your own genome, and upon your visit to Armenia, your welcomed participation ranging from field work, to our DNA collection in Armenian villages, and a visit to our facility with an introduction to the principle members of this project, meal included. Further, all contributors will be acknowledged in the scientific papers that result from this exploration, and those contributing over $1000, will have their names engraved on a plaque that will be placed upon the entrance of this cave.</span></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The difference your contributions will make here are invaluable, as they will increase interest in the scientific exploration of Artsakh, it will reconfirm that peaceful activities are an important part of Artsakh's independence, and that the Armenian Highlands are a very important region of human activity and migration for at least 1.8 million years.  The cave is tucked away in a quiet area not far from the town of Shushi, and is far from the active Line of Contact, and thus, is not in any danger.  It's located in a very hilly and wooden area fully protected from water erosion and other impacts from natural disasters.  The stone tools that have been found in the area indicate extensive human activity, and a sheltered cave has perhaps the greatest concentration of these traces.  We can also reconstruct the environmental changes that have occurred for the last tens of thousands of years.  The changes to the environment by human activity cannot be overstated, and we will have a detailed window into all of this. We have preliminary work available from previous explorations of this site within the last two years, but this is our first attempt to start a full scale exploratory work involving extensive excavation and processing of found materials.  We have included photos of our previous visits to the site, and please feel free to follow through on sources, particularly published works by Professor Levon Yepiskoposyan.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The greatest challenge we may face is the pace of scientific discovery, as some forms of analysis may take longer then we estimate, and publication of the results may be delayed.  There's also the possibility that we may not recover extensive human remains as we expect but what's certain is we'll recover and reconstruct the extensive environmental conditions, including the broad variety of flora and fauna species, some long since extinct, Because Artsakh is a conflict zone, we take every precaution necessary for the safety of the team and in the unlikely event of a full scale military conflict, we will then be forced to delay the work.  </p>

</h3>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We understand that not every individual who wants to contribute to this amazing exploration has the financial capacity to do so, but we value your passion and hope that you can spread the message of this funding campaign so we can truly make an impact.  Please don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools available here, which will ensure that a much broader audience will contribute to this project.</span></div>

<p>The south-eastern part of
the Lesser Caucasus where Karabakh is located has provided numerous evidence of
continuous human settlement throughout the Pleistocene. The geographical position
of paleoanthropological sites (e.g. Dmanisi in Georgia and Azokh Cave in
Karabakh) indicates the persistence of a natural corridor named the “Caucasus
Isthmus” or the “Trans-Caucasian Corridor”, through which humans have entered
Europe for at least the last 1.8 million years.</p>
<p>Test
excavations were made at Alexana Cave, in the Shushi region, in July, 2014,
June and September, 2015. The field work was conducted by Prof. Levon
Yepiskoposyan (anthropologist, geneticist, Armenia), Dr. Thomas Stafford, Jr.
(geologist, USA), Dr. Morten Allentoft (palaeontologist, geneticist, Denmark),
and Dr. Ashot Margaryan (geneticist, Armenia, Denmark). An approximately 2 m
long X 1.5 m wide X 1.8 m deep test pit approximately 30 meters from the cave mouth
was excavated with shovels and archaeological trowels. </p>
<p>The
scientific importance of Alexana Cave derives from the site containing sediments
that startnear the
limit of <sup>14</sup>C (Carbon 14) and whose vertebrate fossils have
significant potential for yielding ancient DNA (aDNA). If human remains are
encountered in the Cave, they could preserve an unrivalled aDNA record not seen
for any human fossils dating &gt;40,000 years. 
The site could yield ancient genetic data far exceeding the quality of
any present European or Eurasian archaeological locality. The vertebrate fossil
record is exceptionally rich and is evidence that paleontological data alone
from Alexana Cave could define it as overwhelmingly important well of scientific
discovery.</p>
<p>We
can state that t<span>here is a real
possibility that we may in fact identify two <i>Homo</i> species (<i>H.
neanderthalensis</i>, and <i>H. sapiens</i>)
in this exceptionally promising site. To date, there have been reassuring
signs of early human habitation within the Armenian Highland, but mainly
through various indirect links, such as early human tools. This site will
give us a true glimpse of prehistoric human presence within the Armenian
plateau. In general, we consider that any such scientific activity within
Karabakh will greatly impact its active involvement in contemporary research.</span></p>
<p>Bones
observed during excavation were collected <i>in situ</i>, were recorded by stratigraphic
position and later radiocarbon dated by using AMS <sup>14</sup>C. Significant numbers
of medium to large mammal bones and one large bird were encountered during test
excavations. In addition, small mammals ranging from shrews to voles were
recovered, which when combined with the large fauna, will provide an excellent
paleoecological history for the region.</p>
<p>Three
stratigraphic positions in Test Pit 1 were dated by using four AMS <sup>14</sup>C
measurements on medium-sized mammal bone. The ages range from &gt;41,700 to &gt;50,000
Radiocarbon Years (RC) and are evidence that sediments from at least 47 cm below
the modern cave floor are beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating (~48-50,000 years).
 </p>
<p>The
significance of the preliminary survey results so far are:</p>
<p>1)<span> 
</span>Sediments
less than 0.5 meters beneath the modern cave floor surface are &gt;42,000 years
old.</p>
<p>2)<span> 
</span>Bones
from medium to large mammals dating &gt;42,000 years old have unusually good
chemical preservation considering their significant geological age.</p>
<p>3)<span> 
</span>The
sedimentary sequence contains significant amounts of vertebrate microfauna
(shrews, voles and other rodents) that are otherwise rare paleontological finds.</p>
<p>These
data are an indication of the cave’s enormous potential for future archaeological
and paleontological research. First, sediments less than 0.5 m below the cave floor
are greater than 42,000 years old. This indicates that Neanderthal-age strata are
readily accessible by shallow excavation and could be present on the surface. It
is possible that the uppermost decimetres of Test Pit 1 are also &gt;40,000 years
old, which indicates that essentially no sedimentation has occurred for tens of
thousands of years. A possible explanation for this zero-to-low sedimentation rate
is the sediments originated from a now-closed cave fissure immediately above or
adjacent to Test Pit 1. Although bones within a meter vertically of the cave floor
are &gt;42,000 to 50,000 years old, their chemical preservation resembles fossils
that are less than 10,000 years old. This relatively good preservation portends
that ancient DNA (aDNA) could be preserved in fossils dating to the Neanderthal
period and older. </p>
<p>Although
the test pit sediments are at least 42,000 years old and beyond the limits of present
radiocarbon dating techniques, the microfauna, especially from the microtine
rodents, will enable biochronologic age dating of sediments older than 50,000
years.</p>
<p>We would like to start large-scale
excavations in a more thorough manner, hoping to obtain
detailed core samples of the sedimentary strata and uncover convincing evidence
of early human habitation. We are planning to work in the cave for ~20 days in the summer 2016.  Once we know
the maximum depth of the sediments, we could postulate the absolute age at the
bottom and determine whether it’s 60,000 years old or even 150,000.</p>
<p>If
human remains are encountered in Alexana Cave, they could preserve an
unrivalled aDNA record not seen for any human fossils dating &gt;40,000 years.
The site could yield ancient genetic data far exceeding the quality of any
present European or Eurasian archaeological locality. The vertebrate fossil
record is exceptionally rich and is evidence that paleontological data alone
from Alexana could define the cave as a regionally important scientific
discovery.</p>
<p>In
conclusion, I can state that there is a real possibility that we may in fact
identify two human species (H. neanderthalensis, and early H. sapiens) in this
exceptionally promising site. To date, there have been promising signs of
early human habitation within the Armenian Highland, but mainly through various
indirect links, such as early human tools. This site will give us a true
glimpse of prehistoric human presence within the Armenian plateau. In general,
we consider that any such scientific activity within Karabakh will greatly
impact its active involvement in contemporary research.</p>
<p>To cover all expenses related to the excavations
in Alexana Cave (July-August 2016, 10 team members, 5 local assistants, driver,
housing, meals, equipment, conservation of finds and local transportation during
the course of ~3 weeks) we need approximately 40,000 USD. </p>

Risks & Challenges The greatest challenge we may face is the pace of scientific discovery, as some forms of analysis may take longer then we estimate, and publication of the results may be delayed.  There's also the possibility that we may not recover extensive human remains as we expect but what's certain is we'll recover and reconstruct the extensive environmental conditions, including the broad variety of flora and fauna species, some long since extinct, Because Artsakh is a conflict zone, we take every precaution necessary for the safety of the team and in the unlikely event of a full scale military conflict, we will then be forced to delay the work.  
    

Other Ways You Can Help

We understand that not every individual who wants to contribute to this amazing exploration has the financial capacity to do so, but we value your passion and hope that you can spread the message of this funding campaign so we can truly make an impact.  Please don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools available here, which will ensure that a much broader audience will contribute to this project.

The south-eastern part of
the Lesser Caucasus where Karabakh is located has provided numerous evidence of
continuous human settlement throughout the Pleistocene. The geographical position
of paleoanthropological sites (e.g. Dmanisi in Georgia and Azokh Cave in
Karabakh) indicates the persistence of a natural corridor named the “Caucasus
Isthmus” or the “Trans-Caucasian Corridor”, through which humans have entered
Europe for at least the last 1.8 million years.
Test
excavations were made at Alexana Cave, in the Shushi region, in July, 2014,
June and September, 2015. The field work was conducted by Prof. Levon
Yepiskoposyan (anthropologist, geneticist, Armenia), Dr. Thomas Stafford, Jr.
(geologist, USA), Dr. Morten Allentoft (palaeontologist, geneticist, Denmark),
and Dr. Ashot Margaryan (geneticist, Armenia, Denmark). An approximately 2 m
long X 1.5 m wide X 1.8 m deep test pit approximately 30 meters from the cave mouth
was excavated with shovels and archaeological trowels. 
The
scientific importance of Alexana Cave derives from the site containing sediments
that startnear the
limit of 14C (Carbon 14) and whose vertebrate fossils have
significant potential for yielding ancient DNA (aDNA). If human remains are
encountered in the Cave, they could preserve an unrivalled aDNA record not seen
for any human fossils dating >40,000 years. 
The site could yield ancient genetic data far exceeding the quality of
any present European or Eurasian archaeological locality. The vertebrate fossil
record is exceptionally rich and is evidence that paleontological data alone
from Alexana Cave could define it as overwhelmingly important well of scientific
discovery.
We
can state that there is a real
possibility that we may in fact identify two Homo species (H.
neanderthalensis, and H. sapiens)
in this exceptionally promising site. To date, there have been reassuring
signs of early human habitation within the Armenian Highland, but mainly
through various indirect links, such as early human tools. This site will
give us a true glimpse of prehistoric human presence within the Armenian
plateau. In general, we consider that any such scientific activity within
Karabakh will greatly impact its active involvement in contemporary research.
Bones
observed during excavation were collected in situ, were recorded by stratigraphic
position and later radiocarbon dated by using AMS 14C. Significant numbers
of medium to large mammal bones and one large bird were encountered during test
excavations. In addition, small mammals ranging from shrews to voles were
recovered, which when combined with the large fauna, will provide an excellent
paleoecological history for the region.
Three
stratigraphic positions in Test Pit 1 were dated by using four AMS 14C
measurements on medium-sized mammal bone. The ages range from >41,700 to >50,000
Radiocarbon Years (RC) and are evidence that sediments from at least 47 cm below
the modern cave floor are beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating (~48-50,000 years).
 
The
significance of the preliminary survey results so far are:
1) 
Sediments
less than 0.5 meters beneath the modern cave floor surface are >42,000 years
old.
2) 
Bones
from medium to large mammals dating >42,000 years old have unusually good
chemical preservation considering their significant geological age.
3) 
The
sedimentary sequence contains significant amounts of vertebrate microfauna
(shrews, voles and other rodents) that are otherwise rare paleontological finds.
These
data are an indication of the cave’s enormous potential for future archaeological
and paleontological research. First, sediments less than 0.5 m below the cave floor
are greater than 42,000 years old. This indicates that Neanderthal-age strata are
readily accessible by shallow excavation and could be present on the surface. It
is possible that the uppermost decimetres of Test Pit 1 are also >40,000 years
old, which indicates that essentially no sedimentation has occurred for tens of
thousands of years. A possible explanation for this zero-to-low sedimentation rate
is the sediments originated from a now-closed cave fissure immediately above or
adjacent to Test Pit 1. Although bones within a meter vertically of the cave floor
are >42,000 to 50,000 years old, their chemical preservation resembles fossils
that are less than 10,000 years old. This relatively good preservation portends
that ancient DNA (aDNA) could be preserved in fossils dating to the Neanderthal
period and older. 
Although
the test pit sediments are at least 42,000 years old and beyond the limits of present
radiocarbon dating techniques, the microfauna, especially from the microtine
rodents, will enable biochronologic age dating of sediments older than 50,000
years.
We would like to start large-scale
excavations in a more thorough manner, hoping to obtain
detailed core samples of the sedimentary strata and uncover convincing evidence
of early human habitation. We are planning to work in the cave for ~20 days in the summer 2016.  Once we know
the maximum depth of the sediments, we could postulate the absolute age at the
bottom and determine whether it’s 60,000 years old or even 150,000.
If
human remains are encountered in Alexana Cave, they could preserve an
unrivalled aDNA record not seen for any human fossils dating >40,000 years.
The site could yield ancient genetic data far exceeding the quality of any
present European or Eurasian archaeological locality. The vertebrate fossil
record is exceptionally rich and is evidence that paleontological data alone
from Alexana could define the cave as a regionally important scientific
discovery.
In
conclusion, I can state that there is a real possibility that we may in fact
identify two human species (H. neanderthalensis, and early H. sapiens) in this
exceptionally promising site. To date, there have been promising signs of
early human habitation within the Armenian Highland, but mainly through various
indirect links, such as early human tools. This site will give us a true
glimpse of prehistoric human presence within the Armenian plateau. In general,
we consider that any such scientific activity within Karabakh will greatly
impact its active involvement in contemporary research.
To cover all expenses related to the excavations
in Alexana Cave (July-August 2016, 10 team members, 5 local assistants, driver,
housing, meals, equipment, conservation of finds and local transportation during
the course of ~3 weeks) we need approximately 40,000 USD.

Resources for Entrepreneurs: time with advisers, investors, mentors, marketers, managers, and more.

Team Growth: this means more talent to help more social enterprises thrive in the market.
Spring: GTA's National Tour! We are traveling the country to speak at universities and in communities about social entrepreneurship and spark a national movement! This is going to help us find and awaken the best entrepreneurs to solve BIG challenges.

Summer: GTA's Social Innovation Conference & Demo Day! This is where/when everything comes together. We get to showcase all the wonderful social entrepreneurs that we're working with to investors and the world.

Fall: Raise Our Impact Fund!  This means having a stable pool of money to invest in companies that are generating impact for the world and returns for investors. We are excited to prototype a brand new fund structure for our accelerator that helps entrepreneurs have a more equal partnership with investors!

What You Get:

You get to be a part of changing the world economy for the better. From now on any living person will be able to support good around the world and in their communities simply by using their dollars.
You will be kept up-to-date on the most groundbreaking advancements and social-change models being advanced.
Certain contributors will get to spend time meeting and collaborating with the GTA team and those we help! (see perks)


The Impact


A healthier planet: less pollution and destruction; better resource management: fewer famines and a better standard of living globally; stronger communities; a more equal, free, and engaged society
Our work aims to establish a more positive and sustainable future for the next generation, leaving a better earth for us and our children.

Progress so far:

 We were winners in the 2015 SBA Growth Accelerator Fund Competition.
We have received recognition from investors and government officials.
We are an active part of the community: This year we exhibited at NetImpact, hosted a local InnovateHER competition, and are working with several entrepreneurs to help them follow their dreams of bettering the world.
   Risks & Challenges  There are always risks when igniting a movement.  GTA is investing everything to make this work. We have an extremely qualified team skilled in finance, marketing, management and with creative talents and backgrounds that include the arts, the environment, nonprofits, and activism. We also have a highly reputable team of advisers that cover government, consumer products, energy, venture capital, women's advocacy and much more. We have tremendous faith in our team, but our biggest hurdle is funding until we raise our impact fund(s). This is how we intend to be sustainable going forward, but we first have to demonstrate to investors that impact investing is the way of the future. Many impact investors already exist and each day more capital is funneled into social and environmental solutions. We have what startups need to succeed in creating both impact and profit. Your contributions help fund our work in the short term while we continue to build a track record of success for our social entrepreneurs!

Modern high-input agriculture, through the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, is a major factor in environmental change and the breakdown of natural ecosystems.</p><p> </p><p>The agricultural revolutions of the twentieth century changed the world. In particular the development of synthetic nitrogen fixation and use of nitrogen fertiliser, that through improved food security allowed the population to more than double, and today reaching 7 billion. But paradoxically the use of fertilisers and other high input systems that have benefited humanity in the past, also threatens it today. The release of atmospheric nitrous oxide from agricultural use accounts for 67% of human nitrous oxide emissions. In the atmosphere nitrous oxide acts as a greenhouse gas and is a major contributor to climate change.</p><p> </p><p>Problems associated with industrial agriculture is not restricted to the developed world, they are global. Communities in developing nations, particularly those in the tropics, will be the hardest hit by the adverse effects of climate change. This is largely due to the expected increase in the frequency and severity of natural events such as flooding, drought and disease outbreaks. Many people in less-developed nations are already facing serious food scarcity. They are extremely vulnerable to any external environmental changes which threaten their agricultural productivity.</p><p> </p><p>There is clearly an urgent need to increase agricultural productivity in regions of widespread hunger and poverty. Also important to the alleviation of food insecurity is the application of sustainable agriculture. As many communities' livelihoods depend on farming, their fate is tightly interwoven with their environment. Practices which exacerbate environmental degeneration, such as slash and burn agriculture and land mismanagement must therefore be substituted with ones that would compliment both people's lives and the environment.</p><p> </p><p>We require an immediate effort to reform our current agricultural systems, in a manner which will dramatically ameliorate environmental damages. How can we transform modern agricultural systems? More specifically, how can we make agriculture high-yielding and sustainable, particularly to developing communities that are vulnerable to food scarcity, malnutrition and poverty?</p><p> </p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480685968/afcwva01lqppwkjff5dk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h2><p><strong>Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF)</strong> is a highly efficient natural process that converts atmospheric dinitrogen into forms that are useful to plants.

In Tamarugal Pampa, the Northern region of Chile, a legume species is being introduced to salt deserts to re-establish forests. These large leguminous trees have deep roots which can tap into ground water and redistribute water to upper ground levels</p><p> </p><p>In African Savannas where the ecosystem is characterised by grassland and dispersed trees, legumes often nodulate well and actively fix nitrogen in presence of grasses (which remove and utilise nitrogen from soil). A study conducted by Ludwig <i>et al</i>., 2008 in Northern Tanzania showed that the forage quality of grasses growing under Acacia is significantly higher than those growing in open fields. Higher forage quality is accounted for by higher protein and lower fibre concentrations which allow large herbivores to satisfy nutrient requirements before maximum fibre intake was reached.</p><p> </p><p>A wide variety of legumes have also been incorporated into tropical farming systems to provide soil cover and improve soil fertility. For instance, Pinto peanut is increasingly being cultivated in Southern Thailand. In this region, an expanding organic farm has been using Pinto peanut as a rotation crop for the past two years. Not only has the soil fertility been sustained over this period, but large fields of flowering peanuts have attracted many visitors to the farm which directly generates income and increases local interest in subsistence farming. Similarly, in rural areas of central Thailand, Mung bean has been introduced as a mean to improve soil health and overcome water shortages following harvesting season. Over the past ten years, Mung bean cultivation has benefited local farmers by improving soil fertility and increasing yields of subsequently grown crops. Their seeds also generate income as good yields are achieved at low cost and low labour inputs.

They are grown as a food crop, mainly for their grain seed called pulse. They are regularly consumed in many households, and some of the most familiar members include soybeans, peanuts and lentils.  Apart from their economic and nutritional values, legumes have a unique ability that distinguishes them from all other plants. They are capable of forming beneficial partnerships with a special group of soil bacteria known as ‘rhizobia’. This collaboration between plant and bacteria makes it possible for legumes to harvest nitrogen from the air and convert it into forms usable for their growth and productivity.  The benefit of this 'nitrogen fixation' is not limited to the legume plant alone. Once the plant decomposes, nitrogen is returned to the soil, which is then available to every other plant in the vicinity. In other words, legumes can contribute additional external nitrogen to the crop-soil ecosystem.  Although legumes have long been used in agriculture, their natural process for harvesting nitrogen has largely been replaced with the application of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers that were first introduced around 200 years ago, during the agricultural revolution. As the production of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers requires a great amount of energy, nitrogen fertiliser prices are staggering and continue to rise as a direct result of the current energy crisis. Another concern is that nitrogen fertilisers have a devastating effect on the environment. With pressing global environmental issues, the large-scale and continuous use of nitrogen fertilisers is unsustainable and is accelerating environmental degradation.  Our research proposes an alternative to current agricultural practices, in a way that is most productive to both farmers and the environment. By examining a variety of legume plants and beneficial soil bacteria, we aim to identify which plant-bacterium partners are the most efficient at harvesting and returning nitrogen to the soil.  Our project focuses on the development of tropical, small-scale farming systems to provide an immediate solution for underprivileged farmers in communities that are most sensitive to rises in agricultural costs and the environmental effects of global climate change. Developing new agricultural approaches and ensuring food security go hand in hand. Therefore, we have made the most vulnerable communities a priority within our study.  Human activity now has such a profound effect on the Earth’s climate and environment to have raised calls for there to be declared a new geological epoch – the Anthropocene; a time in which human influence dominates, and climate change is proceeding at an unprecedented rate. Modern high-input agriculture, through the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, is a major factor in environmental change and the breakdown of natural ecosystems. The agricultural revolutions of the twentieth century changed the world. In particular the development of synthetic nitrogen fixation and use of nitrogen fertiliser, that through improved food security allowed the population to more than double, and today reaching 7 billion. But paradoxically the use of fertilisers and other high input systems that have benefited humanity in the past, also threatens it today. The release of atmospheric nitrous oxide from agricultural use accounts for 67% of human nitrous oxide emissions. In the atmosphere nitrous oxide acts as a greenhouse gas and is a major contributor to climate change. Problems associated with industrial agriculture is not restricted to the developed world, they are global. Communities in developing nations, particularly those in the tropics, will be the hardest hit by the adverse effects of climate change. This is largely due to the expected increase in the frequency and severity of natural events such as flooding, drought and disease outbreaks. Many people in less-developed nations are already facing serious food scarcity. They are extremely vulnerable to any external environmental changes which threaten their agricultural productivity. There is clearly an urgent need to increase agricultural productivity in regions of widespread hunger and poverty. Also important to the alleviation of food insecurity is the application of sustainable agriculture. As many communities' livelihoods depend on farming, their fate is tightly interwoven with their environment. Practices which exacerbate environmental degeneration, such as slash and burn agriculture and land mismanagement must therefore be substituted with ones that would compliment both people's lives and the environment. We require an immediate effort to reform our current agricultural systems, in a manner which will dramatically ameliorate environmental damages. How can we transform modern agricultural systems? More specifically, how can we make agriculture high-yielding and sustainable, particularly to developing communities that are vulnerable to food scarcity, malnutrition and poverty? Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF) is a highly efficient natural process that converts atmospheric dinitrogen into forms that are useful to plants. BNF is the result of a symbiotic relationship between Legumes (members of the plant family Leguminosae) and nitrogen-fixing bacteria known as rhizobia. Nitrogen fixation occurs in a special root structure, called the nodule, which forms when legume roots become infected with rhizobia.  Of all the necessary nutrients for plant growth and productivity, nitrogen is required in the largest quantity and is often the most limiting factor of crop yield in agricultural systems. Despite being the most abundant element in the atmosphere, the availability of metabolically usable forms is governed by the process of nitrogen fixation. This key biological system is under-utilised in modern agriculture and a neglected area of research, agriculture and ecology. BNF warrants further study, given that the system naturally produces nitrogen in forms available to plants, allowing us to bypass economically and ecologically costly production of nitrogen fertilisers. There is ample evidence that leguminous species, in both wild habitats and agricultural systems, play a key role in ecosystem functioning by improving soil fertility and rehabilitating the ecosystem.  Certain legume species are able to successfully colonise hostile deserts due to their tolerance to highly dry and saline conditions. In Tamarugal Pampa, the Northern region of Chile, a legume species is being introduced to salt deserts to re-establish forests. These large leguminous trees have deep roots which can tap into ground water and redistribute water to upper ground levels In African Savannas where the ecosystem is characterised by grassland and dispersed trees, legumes often nodulate well and actively fix nitrogen in presence of grasses (which remove and utilise nitrogen from soil). A study conducted by Ludwig et al., 2008 in Northern Tanzania showed that the forage quality of grasses growing under Acacia is significantly higher than those growing in open fields. Higher forage quality is accounted for by higher protein and lower fibre concentrations which allow large herbivores to satisfy nutrient requirements before maximum fibre intake was reached. A wide variety of legumes have also been incorporated into tropical farming systems to provide soil cover and improve soil fertility. For instance, Pinto peanut is increasingly being cultivated in Southern Thailand. In this region, an expanding organic farm has been using Pinto peanut as a rotation crop for the past two years. Not only has the soil fertility been sustained over this period, but large fields of flowering peanuts have attracted many visitors to the farm which directly generates income and increases local interest in subsistence farming. Similarly, in rural areas of central Thailand, Mung bean has been introduced as a mean to improve soil health and overcome water shortages following harvesting season. Over the past ten years, Mung bean cultivation has benefited local farmers by improving soil fertility and increasing yields of subsequently grown crops. Their seeds also generate income as good yields are achieved at low cost and low labour inputs. In addition, this legume species is so well adapted to this region's soil that no inoculants, pesticides, herbicides or artificial fertilisers are required. In the valleys of Beira Alta, the mountainous interior of Portugal, nitrogen sustainability has been managed through traditional ecological knowledge over the past 800 years. Two wild legume species have been encouraged to grow on a significant amount of farmland used to cultivate rye. A substantial amount of protein-rich rye grains have been exported from these farming regions to urban areas during this time. Biera Alta region has remained highly productive and sustainable largely due to field rotations with legumes which allowed restoration of cultivated soil fertility. In association with the University of Edinburgh, the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh and the James Hutton Institute, we have had the opportunity to explore and undertake research on legume-rhizobia symbiosis. Having studied the symbiotic specificities of various tropical and arid legume species, we are aware that much remains unexplored in the field of nitrogen-fixing legumes. Because most commercial and cultivated legumes have been selected to thrive in fertilised soils, their benefits to developing communities are likely to be minimal, given the low-input nature of many small-scale farming systems. It is therefore important for us to understand the dynamics of BNF by wild legumes which are adapted to their natural, indigenous soil and environments. These include wild legumes which are able to grow in nutrient poor soils. Research implications (for both tropical and temperate regions):
Identification of novel rhizobia species/strains highly effective at fixing nitrogen.
Directly increase pulse yields with new rhizobial inoculants and different varieties of legumes.
Exclude the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers.
Increase soil health and productivity for growth of various agricultural crops.
Rehabilitate soil in natural ecosystems.
Contribute to the knowledge of legume and rhizobia diversities in Thailand.
 Our immediate goal is to assess the nodulation status of wild legumes growing in the Northern and North-Eastern regions of Thailand. Our project focuses on Thailand for several reasons. Firstly, there are many rural Thai communities that rely on low-input agriculture. Secondly, the country's tropical climate and topographical diversity are likely to harbour various legume and rhizobia species. Finally, thorough research on Thai legumes and their symbiotic partners is generally lacking. Specifically, we aim to:
Collect and preserve nodule samples from wild legume populations
record sample site location and conduct a basic geological research (soil type, soil pH and average rainfall)
Cultivate soil bacteria from nodule samples
Characterise nodule bacteria by DNA sequencing
Re-infect host legumes to authenticate nodule bacteria
 Given sufficient funding, we further aim to:
Infect other non-host legumes with isolated nodule bacteria
Assess the nitrogen-fixation efficiency of each legume-rhizobia partners
 All samples collected from Thailand will be preserved and brought back to Ghent, Belgium, where laboratory work will commence. We aim to complete data collection within 1.5 months and estimate laboratory work to to be completed within four months. We are a non-profit initiative, and 100% of the funds will be used to conduct research work.

<p>Mr.
Marcus Wiley is the founder, Chairman, and majority owner of TCG Global. Mr.
Wiley is the co-inventor and co-owner of all
patents underlying TCG’s gasification technology. In 2007,
Mr. Wiley constructed a commercial-scale gasifier based on TCG’s gasification technology.</p>
<p>Mr.
Wiley is a registered professional engineer in the state of Colorado, with 40
years of experience in mine engineering, mine
management and technology development. After a successful
career with Consolidation Coal Co., Mr. Wiley started Wiley Engineering, Inc,
in 1981 as a mining consultancy specializing in coal. Well known in litigation
support and mine planning, Mr. Wiley's client list includes
AMAX Coal Sales, Arch Minerals, BNI Coal, Consolidation Coal
Co., Devon Energy, Hartshorne Carbon Co., Inc., Intelligent Energy
Solutions, LLC, Marathon Oil Co., Meridian Minerals Co., MICARE/MIMOSA, Westmoreland
Resources, Inc., Placer Dome America, Public Service Company of Colorado, Public
Service Company of New Mexico, Progress Fuels Corp., Tucson Electric Power, and Western
Energy Co.</p>
<p>In 1998, Mr. Wiley
designed, built and placed in service an IRC Section 29 Synfuel Plant located
outside Charleston, WV. Under his management oversight, the plant ran
successfully for 10 years (1998-2007) and produced nearly 40
million tons of Synfuel with an overall efficiency (plant
availability) of 99%. To further his engineering consulting business, Mr. Wiley
formed Wiley Consulting, LLC in 2002.</p>
<p>As TCG Chairman,
Mark Wiley brings a considerable wealth of project development experience
to bear. During his tenure with Consolidated Coal Company and throughout his 30-year
career as an independent consultant / operator in the coal industry, Mr. Wiley
built and operated eight commercially successful plants.
TCG’s staff has collectively spent decades developing and
maintaining very close relationships with equipment fabricators and major
EPC contractors. TCG has the requisite experience and industry relationships to develop
projects ahead of schedule and under budget:</p>
<p>• The current team
at TCG built the first commercial gasifier (based on TCG technology)
in approximately 12 months, starting in late 2006. Additionally, they successfully
re-deployed the gasifier from Denver to Toledo in early 2008, and had the
system permitted and operational in Toledo in less than 90 days.</p>
<p>• In Q4 of 2011, TCG identified an opportunity to develop
three refined coal facilities, all of which needed to
be completed and certified as operational by December 31, 2011.
Despite an industry standard of 3-6 months of fabrication per refined coal system,
TCG was able to design, fabricate, install and certify three systems in 10 weeks,
and did so at 50% the cost of comparable systems.</p>

energy rich
World's largest economies 

vs World's energy production

where there is energy there is growth...
FUTHER MORE DID YOU KNOW?


•About 80 million tons of coal waste is dumped annually

•Inhaling air pollution takes away at least 1-2 years
of a typical human life
•Toxic air pollution poses a greater threat to
children, due to their smaller physical size and lung capacity.


•Air
pollution in China can travel as far as the Central Valley of California
•Rising levels of air
pollution in Beijing has brought a new disease – Beijing cough.
AND.....


•More
than 55 million litres of untreated effluent (sewage) can be dumped
into the ocean around Cape Town, South Africa in a single day


•Marine
sewage outfall in Camps Bay and Green Point, Cape Town are already over their
licensed capacity

•5 billion gallons of waste motor oil is dumped
worldwide every year


•Coastlines
around the world are facing these problems on a daily basis including Sydney,
Barcelona and even New York

BUT NOW....


WE
CAN HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM!!
WE CAN CREATE:

•A clean energy
SOLUTION using untreated effluent (combined with discard carbon-based feedstock)

<br/></div>","THE ISSUE/NEED:Fast forward 5 years into the future: The watermelon at your local grocery store costs over $20. Whoa! How did this happen? With bees at risk of extinction, it may soon be necessary for agricultural crops worldwide to be hand-pollinated, thus significantly driving the up cost of produce. Bee populations in the U.S. mainland have been steadily declining 40-60% each year over the last 6-7 years. Bee loss is happening globally; and there are literally farms of bee populations dissppearing overnight. Some of the problems bees are facing include colony collapse disorder, foul brood, genetic bottlenecking and invasion of Varroa mites and small hive beetles.The future of bees directly impacts the future of humans, with the biggest impact on our food supply.
OUR MISSION:The Gentle Hive Bee Foundation's mission is to protect bees from extinction and return them to thriving by researching and promoting commercial friendly beekeeping techniques that are nonharmful to bees and their environments. Ultimately, we intend to come up with educational guidelines and laws that help implement non-chemical alternatives to commercial beekeeping.  Hawai'i is an optimal environment for beekeeping and research because of the perfect temperatures, abundant fruit and flowers, and limited GMO exposure. Having these elements in place can help control the research environment and focus on what some of the other factors (besides harsh temperatures, lack of variety for bees to eat and GMOs) are causing decline in bee populations.
OUR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:

Secure funding for research projects in searching
for answers as to why the bee populations are disappearing and how to prevent
extinction. 
Conduct research answering questions such as: How can we help to sustain bee life? How do we create a more natural bee hive and environment for sustainability?  
Identify the specific challenges threatening the bees.
Implement and promote specific solutions for what we can do as a community to preserve and
grow our declining bee populations. 
Assist  both the commercial beekeeping industry, who carries the brunt of the responsibility, and also backyard beekeepers who are the small time warriors in widespread consciousness of the problems at hand.  

Provide education and dissimenate information to the public on the findings of this research both online via our website and through written materials.

Train new and existing beekepers in organic beekeeping methods
Help organic beekepers experiencing hive losses by replacing with new hives

OUR IMMEDIATE FUNDING NEEDS:The Gentle Hive Bee Foundation has gained charitable organization status from the State of Hawai'i to move forward as a nonprofit.  The money we raise here will be used to:

<p>Paddling With Purpose is a project started by <a href=""http://paddlingwithpurpose.com/benjamin-webb/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Benjamin Webb</a>,
 an Aussie environmental engineer. We believe that the Rio Marañon, and 
the communities and ecosystems it supports are too important to lose. 
This small grass roots effort is working on a series of projects at 
local, national and international levels to show why the source of the 
Amazon is more valuable in it’s free flowing state than stagnating 
behind a series of mega-dams.</p>
<p>I am donating my time and expenses to participate in this project. I 
hope that you are also inspired by this effort and will consider a

<p><strong></strong></p><h3><strong> What is it we're going to do exactly?<br/>
</strong></h3><p></p>
<p>Throughout our trip we will focus on teaching whitewater safety and 
river/camping skills with the aim of making new connections and

</div><p><b>Mission</b>:
</p>
<p>The Palestine Museum of Natural History and its Palestine
Institute of Biodiversity and Sustainability (PIBS) aim to research, educate
about, and conserve our natural world and our Palestinian culture and heritage,
and to use this knowledge to promote responsible, empowered human interactions
with all components of our environment.</p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Goals</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">:</span></p>
<p>1. Explore the diversity of the fauna, flora,
and human ethnography of Palestine via collections and scientific research that
includes morphology and genetics. This includes cataloguing and building a
physical and an electronic database of geological specimens, fossils, and
existing animals and plants, as well as beginning to catalog and preserve
objects/specimens related to natural history and biodiversity, including human
diversity and history.</p>
<p>2. Promote environmental protection and
responsible interaction between people and the environment, by building
environmental awareness and encouraging conservation of natural resources,
while connecting this awareness to Palestinian heritage.</p>
<p>3- Use the knowledge gained, and the books and
databases and collections, to promote science education so that this institute
becomes one that helps all segments of society in areas such as biology,
ecology, technology, archaeology, ethnology etc.</p>
<p>4. Develop and increase respect: a) for
ourselves (self-empowerment), b) for our fellow human beings regardless of
background, and c) for all living creatures and our shared earth. This will
help create a more peaceful and sustainable world.</p>
<p>5.  Use research results in areas such as biodiversity, history,
culture, permaculture and biological control to promote sustainable communities,
focusing on marginalized communities under threat of continued ethnic
cleansing. The aim is to create a more livable world for all living things, including
contending human communities.</p><p></p><p><b>Accomplishments since launching (June 2014)</b></p>
<p>1) Started and developed the museum (PMNH) in
many areas from organization to furnishing, so that it is now an actual
functioning institution and can receive visitors including students,
researchers, volunteers, and community members.</p>
<p>2) Held a science festival that brought
hundreds of school <span>children and volunteers together for activities such
as experiments and discussions on topics
ranging from critical thinking to physics to environmental protection.</span></p>
<p>3) Published significant research on <span>biodiversity
and initiated several new projects of research, some involving molecular and cytogenetic techniques;
examples include “Decline in Vertebrate Biodiversity of Bethlehem,” and papers
on the scorpion Nebo and on amphibians).</span></p>
<p>4) Worked intensely on our land site to both
reclaim and create an <span>integrated ecosystem of endogenous Palestinian animals
and plants, in an attractive setting..</span></p>
<p>5) Began to <span>rehabilitate some injured and
abandoned animals, mostly wild (owl, tortoise, Muscovy duck, etc.).</span></p>
<p>6) Began to <span>develop permaculture and
aquaculture.</span></p>
<p>7) Began recycling and upcycling <span>waste
material.</span></p>
<p>8) Expanded our digital library for fauna and <span>flora.</span></p>
<p>9) Expanded our digital photo collection.</p>
<p>10) Undertook partnership with many
organizations and government entities (e.g. Qattan, Ministry of Agriculture,
and Environmental Quality Authority). Traveled to Europe and developed good
working relationships with dozens of facilities, individual scientists, and
others.</p>
<p>11) Raised some needed funds (all from
individual donations and mostly from Palestinians).</p>
<p>12) Developed a webpage (palestinenature.org),
a facebook page, and a twitter account, and published several articles about
the Museum in major magazines such as “This Week in Palestine,” and in books such
as <i>Museums in Palestine.</i></p>
<p>13) Carried out over 50 field trips in various
parts of Palestine.  Over forty
volunteers have worked at the Museum in various capacities such as agriculture,
education, research, and conservation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Partnerships</b></p>
<p>We
established a Cytogenetics Laboratory at Bethlehem University (affiliated with
the M.S. program in biotechnology and the Biology Department), which does
clinical and other service and research; 
the Museum now provides direct linkage and collaboration with that
facility.  We have international collaborations with the Jordan University
of Science and Technology (Irbid, Prof. Zuhair Amr), Museum Fur Naturkunde
(Berlin, Dr. Faysal Bibi), Senckenberg Museum, Royal Society for the
Conservation of Nature (Amman, Jordan), Museum of Natural Sciences (Brussels),
Jeunes Palestiniens en Chemin, Syracuse University (Syracuse, New York), and
the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History (Washington, DC).  Locally, we have collaborative arrangements
with the Palestine Museum currently being built on the campus of Birzeit
University, with the Palestine Center for Rapprochement Between People, with
the A.M. Qattan Foundation (focused on education), and with local schools and  other non-governmental organizations. These partnerships
center on education for empowerment, including sustainable living, and
environmental work. Additional partnerships are needed in order to increase our
activities in other high-priority areas, particularly behavioral.</p>
<p><b>Education and conservation through increased
respect</b></p>
<p><b>Principles:</b> The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (UN 1948) states: “Everyone has the right freely to participate in the
cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific
advancement and its benefits.” Various other international conventions have
been promulgated to protect the environment and ensure sustainability of
natural resources. We believe the key to this process lies in human capacity;
hence our goal to increase <b><u>respect</u></b><u>:  a) for ourselves (self-empowerment), b) for
our fellow human beings, regardless of background, and c) for all living
creatures and our shared earth.</u> PMNH has embarked on an ambitious program
not only to research and document nature around us but also to conserve and
educate in the spirit of humanity living as part of an integrated balanced
ecosystem.</p>
<p><b>Education work: </b>We have engaged in
education at all levels in Palestinian society: elementary schools, secondary
schools, undergraduate colleges, graduate schools, and the public at large. We
consider our task as coaches to be facilitation of active learning—rather than “teaching”
or “lecturing.”  We believe in the
Chinese proverb “I hear and I forget, I see and I remember, I do and I

The Palestine Museum of Natural History and its Palestine
Institute of Biodiversity and Sustainability (PIBS) aim to research, educate
about, and conserve our natural world and our Palestinian culture and heritage,
and to use this knowledge to promote responsible, empowered human interactions
with all components of our environment.Goals:
1. Explore the diversity of the fauna, flora,
and human ethnography of Palestine via collections and scientific research that
includes morphology and genetics. This includes cataloguing and building a
physical and an electronic database of geological specimens, fossils, and
existing animals and plants, as well as beginning to catalog and preserve
objects/specimens related to natural history and biodiversity, including human
diversity and history.
2. Promote environmental protection and
responsible interaction between people and the environment, by building
environmental awareness and encouraging conservation of natural resources,
while connecting this awareness to Palestinian heritage.
3- Use the knowledge gained, and the books and
databases and collections, to promote science education so that this institute
becomes one that helps all segments of society in areas such as biology,
ecology, technology, archaeology, ethnology etc.
4. Develop and increase respect: a) for
ourselves (self-empowerment), b) for our fellow human beings regardless of
background, and c) for all living creatures and our shared earth. This will
help create a more peaceful and sustainable world.
5.  Use research results in areas such as biodiversity, history,
culture, permaculture and biological control to promote sustainable communities,
focusing on marginalized communities under threat of continued ethnic
cleansing. The aim is to create a more livable world for all living things, including
contending human communities.Accomplishments since launching (June 2014)
1) Started and developed the museum (PMNH) in
many areas from organization to furnishing, so that it is now an actual
functioning institution and can receive visitors including students,
researchers, volunteers, and community members.
2) Held a science festival that brought
hundreds of school children and volunteers together for activities such
as experiments and discussions on topics
ranging from critical thinking to physics to environmental protection.
3) Published significant research on biodiversity
and initiated several new projects of research, some involving molecular and cytogenetic techniques;
examples include “Decline in Vertebrate Biodiversity of Bethlehem,” and papers
on the scorpion Nebo and on amphibians).
4) Worked intensely on our land site to both
reclaim and create an integrated ecosystem of endogenous Palestinian animals
and plants, in an attractive setting..
5) Began to rehabilitate some injured and
abandoned animals, mostly wild (owl, tortoise, Muscovy duck, etc.).
6) Began to develop permaculture and
aquaculture.
7) Began recycling and upcycling waste
material.
8) Expanded our digital library for fauna and flora.
9) Expanded our digital photo collection.
10) Undertook partnership with many
organizations and government entities (e.g. Qattan, Ministry of Agriculture,
and Environmental Quality Authority). Traveled to Europe and developed good
working relationships with dozens of facilities, individual scientists, and
others.
11) Raised some needed funds (all from
individual donations and mostly from Palestinians).
12) Developed a webpage (palestinenature.org),
a facebook page, and a twitter account, and published several articles about
the Museum in major magazines such as “This Week in Palestine,” and in books such
as Museums in Palestine.
13) Carried out over 50 field trips in various
parts of Palestine.  Over forty
volunteers have worked at the Museum in various capacities such as agriculture,
education, research, and conservation.

Partnerships
We
established a Cytogenetics Laboratory at Bethlehem University (affiliated with
the M.S. program in biotechnology and the Biology Department), which does
clinical and other service and research; 
the Museum now provides direct linkage and collaboration with that
facility.  We have international collaborations with the Jordan University
of Science and Technology (Irbid, Prof. Zuhair Amr), Museum Fur Naturkunde
(Berlin, Dr. Faysal Bibi), Senckenberg Museum, Royal Society for the
Conservation of Nature (Amman, Jordan), Museum of Natural Sciences (Brussels),
Jeunes Palestiniens en Chemin, Syracuse University (Syracuse, New York), and
the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History (Washington, DC).  Locally, we have collaborative arrangements
with the Palestine Museum currently being built on the campus of Birzeit
University, with the Palestine Center for Rapprochement Between People, with
the A.M. Qattan Foundation (focused on education), and with local schools and  other non-governmental organizations. These partnerships
center on education for empowerment, including sustainable living, and
environmental work. Additional partnerships are needed in order to increase our
activities in other high-priority areas, particularly behavioral.
Education and conservation through increased
respect
Principles: The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (UN 1948) states: “Everyone has the right freely to participate in the
cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific
advancement and its benefits.” Various other international conventions have
been promulgated to protect the environment and ensure sustainability of
natural resources. We believe the key to this process lies in human capacity;
hence our goal to increase respect:  a) for ourselves (self-empowerment), b) for
our fellow human beings, regardless of background, and c) for all living
creatures and our shared earth. PMNH has embarked on an ambitious program
not only to research and document nature around us but also to conserve and
educate in the spirit of humanity living as part of an integrated balanced
ecosystem.
Education work: We have engaged in
education at all levels in Palestinian society: elementary schools, secondary
schools, undergraduate colleges, graduate schools, and the public at large. We
consider our task as coaches to be facilitation of active learning—rather than “teaching”
or “lecturing.”  We believe in the
Chinese proverb “I hear and I forget, I see and I remember, I do and I
understand.” Thus the museum we are creating is not a site for merely seeing
and hearing about things, but for DOING: that is, active learning.  Drawing
upon our previous activities, we have worked with summer camp students to
increase their appreciation of the wonder of nature and strengthen their inquisitive
minds through such modes as questioning and critical thinking. Since September
2014 we have been working with 8-to-10-year-olds at a local private school, on
a program of natural science exploration. We partnered with the A.M. Qattan
Foundation for the Science Festival, 20-29 November 2014, attended by hundreds
of students. Teachers and students worked together to design exhibits and
interactive modules for activities that help to change attitudes and behaviors
about science and the environment.

Conservation work: Using mostly volunteers
and our limited resources, the Museum has made considerable effort in a short
time—and with many successful examples to show for it. We wrote articles on
decline in biodiversity, and on best practices to protect our fragile environment,
increasingly threatened by climate change, overpopulation, habitat destruction,
colonial settlement activities, and so forth. We built an aviary which helps
rehabilitate injured birds. We took thousands of photographs of the beauty and

</div></div>","Short Summary 

Welcome to Ingan Tours...
Do you love nature? Want to experience Aboriginal Culture? Are you adventurous?
If so, then please hear our story...
Ingan Tours was created by three family members who identify as Jirrbal Rainforest Aboriginal people.  Dr Ernie Grant (Jirrbal Elder), Sonya Jeffrey (Manager) and Caroline Grant (Senior Tour Guide) had a dream to share their authentic Aboriginal heritage and the ancient knowledge they possess with the world. 


Left to Right: Sonya Jeffrey, Dr Ernie Grant, Caroline Grant
Our traditional lands as Rainforest Aboriginal people sit within beautiful World Heritage Listed Rainforest of Tropical North Queensland, Australia.



Our culture has survived for over 40,000 years and our connection with the natural environment is interwoven and demonstrated through all of our unique cultural tour experiences.

When on tour with our Aboriginal guides you learn to see the natural environment through our eyes, hear our creation stories and taste our unique bush food.
Over the past three and a half years our dream has been acknowledged!  It is now time for Ingan Tours to establish a base of operation in order to grow further.  

We urgently require assistance to enable us to continue our unique cultural tour operations and to develop long term employment outcomes for our people.
By supporting our project you will provide invaluable support to local Aboriginal people in employment, continue to foster strong cultural values and most importantly, you ensure that the transmission of our cultural knowledge and customs continue to be passed down to future generations. 


Ingan Tour Guide (Tonya Grant) sharing her weaving techniques with a guest...

Ingan Tours has been offered a wonderful opportunity by Queensland Rail to caretake and maintain the historical Tully Railway Station.  Currently the business has been operating from our personal residence.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for us to finally give our business a home! 

Our  continuing dream doesn't just stop with Ingan Tours.  The restoration and beautification programme for the Tully Railway Station will have a very positive impact on our community and for guests visiting the region, either by train or vehicle.    


What We Need & What You Get




Have you ever looked at an historical building in your community and wondered what it would look like restored to it's former glory?  Yep, I bet you have, well, this is what Ingan Tours is wishing to achieve - take a heritage  building back to it's former glory and proudly share this with our community and guests and most importantly, finally have a base from which to operate.
To simplify our proposal to you, we have provided a two part program.


Phase One



Restoration of the Tully Railway Station and grounds

Restoration of the Tully Railway Platform (photo below)


A current photo of the Tully Railway Station Platform...


How the Tully Railway Station Platform looked under the care of Dr Ernie Grant...



Phase Two



Your support will allow us to develop some really exciting ideas such as:

Cultural Museum & Aboriginal Art Gallery
Organic Cafe and Organic Fruit & Vegetable Shop
Gift Shop
Front Office/Reception and Tour Information
Staff Facilities
Conference Room
Organic vegetable gardens and orchards
Landscaped Gardens
Cultural Learning workshops to ensure the transmission of cultural knowledge 



Learning to weave traditional baskets such as the Jawun (bicorneal weave) is important to our people...as it ensures the transmission of cultural knowledge



To achieve our dream, we have included an estimated cost below: 


If we do not achieve our goal of $200,000USD then whatever funds are raised will still be used towards the renovations and refurbishments.  We will continue to improve the Tully Railway Station on limited income, but, this will obviously extend the timeframe to complete the works.To get the ball rolling, we would like to invite our first 10 Contributors to take up this unique opportunity...4 Night/3Day Package - (Free to 1 person) conditions apply
The first 10 people to donate $500USD to our cause will win a 4 Night/3 Day package free of charge (airfares not included) Package applies to 1 person only, extra travelling person will be charged at the rate of $700AUD.  

The package comprises 4 nights accommodation at Ingan Eco Lodge, our Bed and Breakfast accommodation set high on a hill,
with spectacular views of the Bulgun Creek area and surrounding mountain
ranges.  One day kayak tour, full day hike on ancient aboriginal trading routes and a chance to spotlight some of North Queensland's marsupials at night.

The Impact


There are so many challenges facing our people today.  Our people have overcome enormous hurdles to achieve great things for their communities and for Australia.  However, there are still many of our people who are disadvantaged in our country.  Statistically, Aboriginal people have poorer health, less educational opportunities, shorter life expectancy, limited employment options and many live in very remote areas.  Along with these issues, many still have to deal with negative and social attitudes.
One of the major challenges that unfortunately still faces Aboriginal communities today are the negative social attitudes that are still common.  Much has been done recently to create an understanding amongst non-indigenous people about their past and how it still affects them today.  Reconciliation has become important in creating better understanding of Aboriginal culture and building stronger relationships within the whole community.


Reconciliation - Creating better understanding of Aboriginal Culture...


For Ingan Tours this is a harsh reality and we have worked extremely hard to participate in minimising these issues in the best way possible for our people.  One of the key criteria for our business is to improve and increase employment of local Aboriginal people, in particular our family members.  Just in the community of Tully alone there is a very high percentage of young Aboriginal people without jobs.


Your support in raising funds for the improvements to the Tully Railway Station are crucial to the plight of improving health, educational opportunities, life expectancy and most importantly, employment options.  Ingan Tours would welcome any support possible, knowing that it gives back to our people and our community in more ways than one.

 Risks & Challenges





As a Tour Operator we are aware of risks and how best to minimise risks within our business.  We provide our staff with in house training and ensure that our policies and procedures align with all levels of government.   
At this stage of the project we can only generalise on the type of risks associated with this project:
Washing of Walls and Ceilings 


Cleaning walls and ceilings that may contain lead in the old paint
Allergic reaction to cleaning products
Cleaning in a confined space whilst using strong smelling chemicals

Cleaning Gardens & Removal of Rubbish


Allergic reaction to plants
incorrect use of garden tools
Injury from sharp tools (cane knife, chainsaw, whipper snipper)
Injury from lifting heavy objects

Building & Renovations


Removal of building debris
Repair of doors and windows
Painting and decorating 


There is no silver lining to achieving this goal.  Unforeseen circumstances may arise, but, we will be ready to manage incidents in a timely and professional manner.  

We will work with our staff, family members and volunteers to ensure that we provide a safe working environment and will create a risk management plan upon pre-inspection of the Tully Railway Station.  We will do the following:  



Investigate the building site first and identify internal and external risks associated with this project.

Implement a risk management plan.
Rate the level of risk on a scale of 1 through to 10 (1 being a very minor risk and 10 being a very high risk).
Implement safety procedures for each risk identified.
Provide safety induction to participants prior to commencing work on the site.
Ensure that staff holding remote area first aid certificates are on site at all times to supervise and oversee the safety of the participants.
Provide personal protective clothing where required.

A majority of the clean up work will be conducted by Ingan Tours and staff.  This will be on a voluntary basis but management is aware of their legal requirements to ensure a safe working environment and staff are aware of their duty of care to themselves and others when working in any environment.

Passionate change agents from across the country are eager to devote their time and energy towards manifesting our shared aspirations. They need YOUR HELP and YOUR INVESTMENT in their training at action camp to equip them with the skills they need to fight for a more equitable and just society.
Why an Action Camp?
The world we long for and deserve is at odds with the unjust society that exists today. We see this injustice in runaway climate change, pollution and violence in our communities, racism and mass-incarceration, warmongering, and an economic system that breeds income insecurity and privileges the few. To pull our world towards equity and justice we need YOUR HELP empowering and supporting activists to take creative, strategic, and courageous principled direct action. Localize This! is a week-long intensive training camp that brings together activists from across multiple issues and movements to share and disseminate insights, lessons learned, and victory stories. The camp may be the closest thing to a college of activism. Localize This! is designed to equip new and veteran organizers with the skills they need to inspire collective action. 

Impact of Localize This! Action Camp

What started out as training ground for a community's fight to stop a
 transnational corporation's environmental destruction
has turned into an annual celebration (this is our 7th year) of some of the best our movements 
for justice have to offer. Subsequent last year's camp, participants helped organize and deployed the epitome of a successful direct action. Their technical blockade of a oil train for 8 hours earned tons of media and was done in a manner sympathetic to and building alliance with railroad workers. After last year's camp a female activist took their climb training learned at camp and engaged in the first tree sit in Washington state in 14 years. This past year we took the lessons learned from the kayak flotilla during the gravel mine fight and the 6 years of offering kayak trainings at camps and trained 300+ activists to be part of the sHellNo! kayak flotilla's.  Now, kayaktivism is spreading across the globe from Alaska, Finland, Ukraine, to Australia and beyond as a new innovative tactic.Localize This! is a hub for the cross-pollination of creative strategies and tactics for social transformation. Like dandelions seeds blowing in the wind, what starts at Localize This! sprouts into creative action all year across the country.Why We Need Your HelpThe week-long Localize This!

<h3>Help Hike the Pipe! Raise Awareness and Inspire Resistance Against the LNG Pipeline and Export Project in Oregon!</h3>
<div>This summer, a group of concerned and passionate Oregonians will hike through 232 miles of our beautiful state to protest the Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) pipeline and export terminal that is proposed to cut through Southern Oregon. They will hike along the actual route of the pipeline, documenting their interaction with the individuals, communities, and ecosystems threatened by the project.</div>
<p>
Their bold and novel form of activism will show policy makers that Oregon will not tolerate the exploitation of public and private land for private gain. Hike the Pipe! will <b>generate awareness</b> of the LNG issue in Oregon while <b>building solidarity</b> with affected communities, which will allow for more effective resistance to the LNG project.</p>

<h3>What is at Stake?</h3>
<p>The Jordan Cove Energy Project is a proposal to construct a 232-mile <b>pipeline</b> through Southern Oregon as well as the West Coast's first Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) <b>export terminal.</b> </p>
<p>This pipeline would:</p>
<p>     - clearcut hundreds of miles of forest</p>
<p>     - cross more than 400 rivers and streams</p>
<p>     - destroy large swaths of habitat for endangered birds and animals</p>
<p>     - use eminent domain to take private property from hundreds of landowners</p>
<p>Here are a few facts on the export terminal:</p>
<p>     -The powerplant built to support the terminal would become Oregon's largest greenhouse gas emitter</p>
<p>     -Annual exports would be 235% what the entire state of Oregon burns annually</p>
<p>Thus, the export project would pollute our state while raising gas prices and increasing our dependence on foreign energy! The Canadian corporation in charge of the project is planning to build an industrial freeway through some of the most wild and scenic parts of Oregon, all to export fracked gas from the Rockies to Asian markets. This project not only poses major harms to communities and ecosystems, but also deepens the Climate Crisis by facilitating the expanded use of dirty fossil fuels.</p>

<h3>Why Hike the Pipe?</h3>
<p>Many concerned citizens in Oregon have been fighting this pipeline and export terminal for years throughout the permitting process. They have gone to meetings, written comments, lobbied politicians, and tried to make their voice heard in letters to the editor. Much work has been done, but now it is time to escalate our tactics and try more creative approaches.<br/><br/>Hike the Pipe! will allow the activists to develop a personal relationship with the land and landowners affected by the LNG pipeline. The stories they hear will be shared with the statewide audience through a multi-medium blog updated daily. By telling the story of the real lived experience in these communities, Oregonians from across the state will be able to understand the projects full scope, and in turn understand what makes it so controversial. <br/><br/>Hike the Pipe! will also bring people together in protest and friendship as hikers participate in 4 different town events along the route. There will be one community event in each county directly affected by the project in order to display the broad base of opposition to LNG in Oregon. These events are being planned by members of the community, which will ensure they are organic and candid expressions of the community's story. Please help make this storytelling adventure possible! </p>

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>We are a grassroots group of activists hailing from all over the state of Oregon. We have lost faith in our political system's ability to confront important issues such as the Jordan Cove Energy Project, so we are sidestepping the political process to more effectively resist corporate exploitation of our land and resources.</p>
<p>We are not landowners or professional environmentalists; however, we see ample opportunity for average citizens to mobilize and do meaningful political work. We are excited to use this special time in our young lives to do this project in solidarity with affected individuals and communities to make sure we keep the fossil fuel industry out of Oregon. We are not against jobs, nor are we against business; we merely seek to have a more fulfilling discussion about jobs and business, one that has the public interest as its end goal. Such a conversation would help break down some of the barriers between urban and rural communities, allowing us to resist in solidarity against corporate greed and government overreach.</p>

<h2>What we're about...</h2>
<p>Jack's Solar Garden will be a one-of-a-kind community solar garden located in Boulder County, Colorado. We're a family-owned social enterprise that won the opportunity from Xcel Energy to build a 1.2 MW solar array on our farm to help make our land profitable once again. We’re collaborating with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Colorado State University, and the University of Arizona who will study crop and vegetation growth underneath and around our future solar panels. We will establish a large pollinator habitat of thick perennial bushes and trees around the outside of the solar array to provide forage for local bees. We plan to donate at least 2% of our electricity (enough for ~10 homes) to low-income households in Boulder County. We will offer educational tours for school kids and our community to get folks to learn more about the food and energy nexus. Plus, we want to work with the local arts community to showcase artist's work within the solar array via an artist in residence program. </p>
<h2>Who we are ...</h2>
<p>My grandfather, Jack, purchased my family's farm in 1972 to farm hay and alfalfa in his retirement. After my grandfather and grandmother passed away, the farm was transferred to my mother who owns the farm today. Jack's Solar Garden came about as a means to make our farm profitable as decreasing hay and alfalfa yields have made our current farming practices uneconomical.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557331205/t0ew7doaugte8sgykpkr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My father and I are the sole owners of Jack's Solar Garden. We do not want to take investor funds to develop our solar garden, instead we're looking for community buy-in through subscriptions to our solar garden to make our idea financially feasible. Further, we started this crowdfunding campaign to find like-minded individuals unable to subscribe inside or outside our community that want to see our farm succeed by supporting us in this early stage to ensure we can build our solar garden this year. All your contributions will go towards Jack's Solar Garden donating an equivalent amount of our solar production as bill credits to a local non-profit organization(s).</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get...</h3>
</div><div>
<p>To build Jack's Solar Garden outright, we need $2 million for construction and upfront costs. Along with this crowdfunding campaign, we are actively seeking subscriber buy-in from local governments, companies, and residents in and around Boulder County. Long-term operations and maintenance of the solar garden will be supported via the sale of Renewable Energy Credits to Xcel Energy. Revenue generated from our social enterprise will support my family in maintaining Jack's Solar Garden over the following 20 years, which includes funds for unexpected damage to the system from hail, fire, or other calamities, AND help us start up new agricultural activities around the farm (e.g., caring for sheep, alpaca, turkeys, etc., expanding our apple orchard, improving our beekeeping venture).</p>

<p>We're looking to raise $30,000 through crowdfunding. This funding will help Jack's Solar Garden continue reaching out to community members to sign up as subscribers to ensure our community solar garden comes to fruition.</p>
<p>PLUS, once we reach this $30k mark, we'll donate ~5.7kW of power to a local Boulder County nonprofit organization(s) for a 20 year term! </p>
<p>If somehow we get more than $30k, we'll continue to donate power to local nonprofits at a rate of 380W for every $2,000 over our target.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting Jack’s Solar Garden, YOU will put clean energy into OUR grid. YOU will kickstart a one-of-a-kind research site operated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Colorado State University. YOU will teach children that food and energy can be farmed together. YOU will showcase Boulder County art, plant a habitat where local bees can forage, and freely share electricity with OUR neighbors in need.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With any project, there are risks and challenges. We've simply already bypassed most of ours! We're down to our last major challenges. The last is the most challenging of the bunch...</p>
<p>1) Boulder County's Planning Commission (who voted 8-0 in favor on May 15th!) and County Commissioners (who will vote on June 13th) must vote in favor of Jack's Solar Garden for us to see our project come to fruition. Their votes are a part of Boulder County's Special Land Use Review coordinated via the County's Land Use Department. The respective dates of the County's hearings where votes will be cast for or against Jack's Solar Garden are May 15th and June 13th. </p>
<p>To us, it is unlikely that Boulder County's Commissioners will vote against Jack's Solar Garden as we have been working closely with the Land Use Department for the past year to ensure we are in compliance with their regulations and are promoting the ideals of the County through our project.</p>
<p>2) A Boulder County Building Permit must be received to commence with construction. It is very likely we will be able to easily receive this permit as our selected contractor, Namaste Solar, has worked on Boulder County permitting in the past and will know how best to quickly receive this building permit.</p>
<p>3) Xcel Energy must interconnect Jack's Solar Garden into their electrical grid. As we already won a bid from Xcel Energy to do this interconnection, the main aspects to achieve this objective are ensuring that our engineering specifications are in accordance with Xcel Energy's electrical grid needs. Again, as Namaste Solar has worked on solar gardens in Xcel Energy's network before, this may be a small challenge but unlikely to be much of a risk.</p>
<p>4) The MAIN risk / challenge Jack's Solar Garden has is ensuring we have enough subscribers signed up this summer to feel confident that we can begin construction at a time where we'll be able to sell out our subscriptions by the time construction is completed. We have calculated that we need 50% of our solar array subscriptions sold before we hit this level of confidence to ensure Jack's Solar Garden will happen. YOU can help with this by funding THIS project. YOUR donation will add up and provide free electricity bill credits to a non-profit organization in Boulder County. The donation YOU are about to make to us matters to us. So thanks!</p>
</div></div>","What we're about...
Jack's Solar Garden will be a one-of-a-kind community solar garden located in Boulder County, Colorado. We're a family-owned social enterprise that won the opportunity from Xcel Energy to build a 1.2 MW solar array on our farm to help make our land profitable once again. We’re collaborating with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Colorado State University, and the University of Arizona who will study crop and vegetation growth underneath and around our future solar panels. We will establish a large pollinator habitat of thick perennial bushes and trees around the outside of the solar array to provide forage for local bees. We plan to donate at least 2% of our electricity (enough for ~10 homes) to low-income households in Boulder County. We will offer educational tours for school kids and our community to get folks to learn more about the food and energy nexus. Plus, we want to work with the local arts community to showcase artist's work within the solar array via an artist in residence program. 
Who we are ...
My grandfather, Jack, purchased my family's farm in 1972 to farm hay and alfalfa in his retirement. After my grandfather and grandmother passed away, the farm was transferred to my mother who owns the farm today. Jack's Solar Garden came about as a means to make our farm profitable as decreasing hay and alfalfa yields have made our current farming practices uneconomical.

My father and I are the sole owners of Jack's Solar Garden. We do not want to take investor funds to develop our solar garden, instead we're looking for community buy-in through subscriptions to our solar garden to make our idea financially feasible. Further, we started this crowdfunding campaign to find like-minded individuals unable to subscribe inside or outside our community that want to see our farm succeed by supporting us in this early stage to ensure we can build our solar garden this year. All your contributions will go towards Jack's Solar Garden donating an equivalent amount of our solar production as bill credits to a local non-profit organization(s).
Owners Bios:
Byron Kominek holds a B.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering and a M.Sc. in Environmental Engineering. He has worked for over 12 years in international development including work as a Peace Corps volunteer, a water and sanitation expert for Doctors Without Borders, and a diplomat with the U.S. Agency for International Development. He has spent 6 years in various parts of Africa working on natural resource management projects. He also speaks French and Portuguese.

Kurt Kominek holds a M.Sc in Systems Engineering and a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering. He has about 20 years of working experience as an engineer and project manager and over 20 years of experience teaching computer science as a professor at Northeast State Technical Community College in Tennessee. Further, he has been a Boy Scout Scoutmaster for almost 40 years.
What We Need & What You Get...

To build Jack's Solar Garden outright, we need $2 million for construction and upfront costs. Along with this crowdfunding campaign, we are actively seeking subscriber buy-in from local governments, companies, and residents in and around Boulder County. Long-term operations and maintenance of the solar garden will be supported via the sale of Renewable Energy Credits to Xcel Energy. Revenue generated from our social enterprise will support my family in maintaining Jack's Solar Garden over the following 20 years, which includes funds for unexpected damage to the system from hail, fire, or other calamities, AND help us start up new agricultural activities around the farm (e.g., caring for sheep, alpaca, turkeys, etc., expanding our apple orchard, improving our beekeeping venture).
 

We're looking to raise $30,000 through crowdfunding. This funding will help Jack's Solar Garden continue reaching out to community members to sign up as subscribers to ensure our community solar garden comes to fruition.
PLUS, once we reach this $30k mark, we'll donate ~5.7kW of power to a local Boulder County nonprofit organization(s) for a 20 year term! 
If somehow we get more than $30k, we'll continue to donate power to local nonprofits at a rate of 380W for every $2,000 over our target.
 

For your contribution, not only do you get the satisfaction of supporting BOTH an innovative community solar garden initiative AND nonprofit organization by getting free power from us...
You'll be able to get the perks seen on the right side of your screen!
 


The Impact
By supporting Jack’s Solar Garden, YOU will put clean energy into OUR grid. YOU will kickstart a one-of-a-kind research site operated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Colorado State University. YOU will teach children that food and energy can be farmed together. YOU will showcase Boulder County art, plant a habitat where local bees can forage, and freely share electricity with OUR neighbors in need.
 


Risks & Challenges
With any project, there are risks and challenges. We've simply already bypassed most of ours! We're down to our last major challenges. The last is the most challenging of the bunch...
1) Boulder County's Planning Commission (who voted 8-0 in favor on May 15th!) and County Commissioners (who will vote on June 13th) must vote in favor of Jack's Solar Garden for us to see our project come to fruition. Their votes are a part of Boulder County's Special Land Use Review coordinated via the County's Land Use Department. The respective dates of the County's hearings where votes will be cast for or against Jack's Solar Garden are May 15th and June 13th. 
To us, it is unlikely that Boulder County's Commissioners will vote against Jack's Solar Garden as we have been working closely with the Land Use Department for the past year to ensure we are in compliance with their regulations and are promoting the ideals of the County through our project.
2) A Boulder County Building Permit must be received to commence with construction. It is very likely we will be able to easily receive this permit as our selected contractor, Namaste Solar, has worked on Boulder County permitting in the past and will know how best to quickly receive this building permit.
3) Xcel Energy must interconnect Jack's Solar Garden into their electrical grid. As we already won a bid from Xcel Energy to do this interconnection, the main aspects to achieve this objective are ensuring that our engineering specifications are in accordance with Xcel Energy's electrical grid needs. Again, as Namaste Solar has worked on solar gardens in Xcel Energy's network before, this may be a small challenge but unlikely to be much of a risk.
4) The MAIN risk / challenge Jack's Solar Garden has is ensuring we have enough subscribers signed up this summer to feel confident that we can begin construction at a time where we'll be able to sell out our subscriptions by the time construction is completed. We have calculated that we need 50% of our solar array subscriptions sold before we hit this level of confidence to ensure Jack's Solar Garden will happen. YOU can help with this by funding THIS project. YOUR donation will add up and provide free electricity bill credits to a non-profit organization in Boulder County. The donation YOU are about to make to us matters to us. So thanks!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our story</h3>
<p>We are Sari, Mareike and Paul, a team of ocean lovers and conservation experts that developed this idea at a marine conservation hackathon and proceeded to win a small amount of prize money. We used this money to do some field tests on willingness to pay for tourists and explored the application needed for this in more detail. We are now ready and informed fully to develop the app and launch it in the marine tourism and conservation sector.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need  25 000 USD towards the development of  the prototype of the application and its associated financial functions in order to get a proof of concept in the field.</li>
<li>For individuals donations of 500 USD or over you will get your name on our website and for companies with donations of 1000 USD or over you will get your logo as a sponsor on our website.</li>
<li>Donations of 100 USD or over will get a digital marine life photograph and a personal thank you note. </li>
<li>After the application is ready we can start implementing in the field and we will send all donors over 50 USD success stories of marine life numbers and community benefits one year after the application is launched so you can stay tuned and really see what wonderful impact your donation had. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We and our many colleagues working in the biodiversity and marine conservation sectors believe this innovation is a game changing idea, especially in the developing country context where coastal communities lack incentives to protect marine life. Science has demonstrated that number one factor in successful marine protected areas is stakeholder buy in. This is what Ocean Eye is working at. It will enable a direct and transparent payment from tourists to the community and provide them an incentive to protect sharks, turtles, manta rays, dolphins and many other marine animals instead of killing them for short term cash. </p>
<p>As an example, shark fin is priced at 600 USD a kilo, a real example of shark sightings at a dive operation in Papua, Indonesia showed that if one shark sighting by divers was priced at 50cents, the local community would have received 4653 USD over one year as direct payment. Creating a real financial incentive to control shark fishing in the community. </p>
<p>It will also empower the tourists and the marine recreation sector to be part of the solution and provide a tangible benefit to the communities in the area they visit. In addition this app can provide much needed citizen's science that can further improve the conservation of these species.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are engaging an experienced tech company that has also worked with community interphases to do our app to ensure it will work well in various community and tourism situations and provide flexible enough functions to tailor the species and prices i.e. high end tourists vs budget destinations and to be able to adjust the species according to local issues and biodiversity. </p>
<p>The app has big potential to scale as it does not need ongoing NGO support or funding. The tourism sector can adopt it themselves to use in their areas to help achieve conservation outcomes.</p>
<p>There is always a risk involved when working with communities in conservation and we are consulting broadly with groups and experts in marine conservation and community work that will help us establish guidelines and best practices to ensure the best long-term environmental and social impacts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please spread this campaign and the need for urgent action to halt biodiversity decline in our oceans. We have no time to waste. Join our mailing list on <a href=""https://oceaneye.io"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://oceaneye.io</a>  for more updates. Thank you!</p>

The BioBlitz is a world-wide movement in which teams of volunteer scientists, families, students, teachers, and community members work together to find and identify as many species of plants, animals, microbes, fungi, and other organisms as possible over a 24-hour period. There have been BioBlitz events all over Canada, the United States, Australia, Africa, China, and Europe— and in 2015, the Kingston Field Naturalists will hold their Bioblitz at Wintergreen for the first time! Our goal is to locate and identify at least 600 species during the Wintergreen BioBlitz, which will take place June 12 and 13, 2015. The Bioblitz itself is run by The Kingston Field Naturalists and powered by their network of professional and amateur naturalists who volunteer their time and expertise to help identify species and share their knowledge with the general public in Bioblitz related activities. This campaign will specifically cover the costs of hosting the Bioblitz at Wintergreen. Do your part in building awareness about the diversity of living organisms on the 204 acres of Wintergreen.
What We Need & What You GetSome BioBlitz events enjoy the sponsorship of large organizations or foundations to cover costs. For example, National Geographic supports the BioBlitz movement by sponsoring BioBlitz events across the United States and by making educational materials available through their website. Since Wintergreen doesn’t enjoy the sponsorship of National Geographic (not just yet, anyway!), this campaign was designed to help Wintergreen host this event. Your support means a lot to us—whether you are able to invest in this event financially or join us as a volunteer, your help would be most welcomed.

So...
Our goal is to raise $1,500 for hosting the BioBlitz through friends of Wintergreen, and ... well ... friends of the planet!

The campaign will pay for the expenses associated with hosting BioBlitz 2015 at Wintergreen, including event insurance, lodge operating costs, trail preparation, mowing of fields for tenting and BBQ, and staff time. There are four different perks available for those who donate!



The Impact

A BioBlitz provides information to scientists and to the public about changes that could occur due to global warming or invasive species. You, your kids, relatives and friends can learn about local species, and at the same time, help fight global warming through education and advocacy.We all need to participate to collect information. There are some rapid environmental changes occurring, and species need to be recorded very quickly. The BioBlitz movement helps to do this.

Let's not forget that coming in direct contact 
with plants and animals and other living organisms makes us more sensitive to the beauty and fragility of the natural world, making us all more likely to address urgent 
environmental problems that the BioBlitz movement might identify. 



The Purpose



The purpose of a BioBlitz is to list as many plant and animal species as possible in a 24-hour period, thus giving a snapshot of the biodiversity of the site.  Both amateur and professional naturalists join forces to spot and identify species and to educate each other and the public about the diversity of the location.

    Other Ways You Can Help 
If you can't contribute money, that's okay!
Kingston Field Naturalists and Wintergreen can both use the help of volunteers. Come help us organize the site! Find some species! Help guide people to the various ecosystems on the land! The more people, the more species we find!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Any assessment of
change requires a baseline against which to which compare. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As the Mergui Archipelago
remains a largely remote, uncharted and pristine areas, no such
baseline currently exists. This project plans to assess the current
reef-health and ecological status of the southernmost group of
islands within the Mergui Archipelago. By understanding the current
conditions, future proposals, parks, and studies will be able to
compare conditions. With a mixture of different survey techniques and
approaches, this assessment will provide considerable data of the
islands terrestrial and marine species, reef-health and the
surrounding underwater features. Sites of unique biodiversity will be
noted for future research and reef-assessment, species lists will be
created to document the vast and unique wildlife that lives on and
near the islands, and bathymetric data will help to monitor the reefs
and  protect future visiting vessel.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1239376/files/20150222030306-pristine-coral-reef-is-abundant-in-the-mergui.jpg?1424602986"" src="""" style=""width: 309px; height: 206px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1239382/files/20150222030449-lionfish-sp-pterois.jpg?1424603089"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 308.009615384615px; height: 206px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Unique new methods will be used
to combine the various data, allowing interested scientists,
researchers, and officials to see the bathymetric, reef-health, and
video footage all synced to the boats GPS coordinates. This will
allow for quick future assessment and a multi-dataset record of the
current reef's condition and health. 
</p>
<p>Local and international
experts, researchers and scientists would be encouraged to join trips
and contribute to the project or knowledge and conservation of the
region. Flexibility will allow for a variety of other smaller
projects to be conducted during this project. This project plans also
allows eco-volunteers to assist throughout the data collection and
surveying methods. Assistance in wildlife survey, both on land and
while on the boat, will play a vital role in supplementing species
lists. Participation in the reef-health map and data collection, via
Manta Tow, will allow eco-volunteers to witness and interact with the
marine life. By allowing active participation in the data collection
and conservation, we will help to raise awareness,
appreciation, and promote protection of this unique area. 
</p>
<p>With proper funding this
project could expand to the central and northern islands of the
Mergui Archipelago, allowing a complete assessment of the reefs,
underwater features, species lists, and future mooring sites. This
will play a vital role in the future of the islands. If the islands
are continually more accessible to visitor, it is crucial that
baseline data is collected, reef-health assessed and surveyed. This
will provide a basis in which to create both eco-tourist destinations
as well as marine protected areas.</p>

<p>By understanding the currently
conditions of these islands informed decisions in conservation and
protection can be made. One hope is to see a trans-border marine
protected area, between Thailand and Myanmar. Our assessment
of the southernmost islands can play a key role for the future of
this pristine and unique area. </p>

Sailing in the ""Forgotten"" Mergui Archipelago 

Our Focus:
Biodiversity
and Geographic Research

The
Myeik (Mergui) Archipelago (see maps below)  in the Andaman Sea off southern Myanmar is
one of few pristine and uncharted coastal tropical island groups left
on the planet. Bordering Thailand to the south, the islands remain
largely uninhabited and undeveloped, and are currently being considered by UNESCO as a World Heritage site. Myanmar’s political
climate has been changing rapidly, and island resource management may
be on the brink of change as well.






In 1997 EcoSwiss
received one of the first permits to operate research cruises in
then-reclusive Burma, and ever since, founder Luca Schueli has been
enabling local and foreign scientists to explore one of the last
marine wildernesses in the world. Luca prefers to call it the Moken Archipelago,
for the seafaring gypsies that used to roam the islands crossing the
border between Thai and Burmese waters.

 




Luca has since
conducted dozens of research trips and expeditions into this
little-documented area, providing wildlife, reef and mangrove forest
survey data that were key to the creation of Lampi National Park.
With this legacy of accomplishment, Luca, 69, is ready to retire, and
wishes to extend his experience, local knowledge and conservation
efforts to the next generation, to pursue new opportunities that will
help preserve Moken resources and culture.



William
Ruzek is a young geographer who would like to pick up the reins and
reinvigorate research operations in new and diverse ways. EcoSwiss
equipment is available, and
free to use,
but 18 years of operations in the tropics has taken a toll - some
equipment is outdated, needs replacement, or requires an overhaul. As
boat owners know, salt water operations come at a price!



We need your help to
continue the conservation and study of one of the last uncharted
marine areas in the world. Our research, baseline surveys and data

Trans-border Marine Protected Area! By assisting in our project you
could help us study, chart, and understand an area where only few

receive the attention and protection it desperately needs.  

 

What We Have 
Key to the operation is our research platform,  the ""Land Rover"" of the seas... SeaNOMAD:



A 14.5m (47') custom-built catamaran envisioned by Luca Schueli.
Almost 7m across! SeaNOMAD  provides excellent research space, boat stability and huge deck space. 






Shallow draft for passing over coral flats and entering rivers (3’ , 90cm).



A time-tested, hard-working boat, with a long history, complete with old sea stories.

The Impact and Conservation Summary



 






Any assessment of
change requires a baseline against which to which compare. As the Mergui Archipelago
remains a largely remote, uncharted and pristine areas, no such
baseline currently exists. This project plans to assess the current
reef-health and ecological status of the southernmost group of
islands within the Mergui Archipelago. By understanding the current
conditions, future proposals, parks, and studies will be able to
compare conditions. With a mixture of different survey techniques and
approaches, this assessment will provide considerable data of the
islands terrestrial and marine species, reef-health and the
surrounding underwater features. Sites of unique biodiversity will be
noted for future research and reef-assessment, species lists will be
created to document the vast and unique wildlife that lives on and
near the islands, and bathymetric data will help to monitor the reefs
and  protect future visiting vessel.



Unique new methods will be used
to combine the various data, allowing interested scientists,
researchers, and officials to see the bathymetric, reef-health, and
video footage all synced to the boats GPS coordinates. This will
allow for quick future assessment and a multi-dataset record of the
current reef's condition and health. 

Local and international
experts, researchers and scientists would be encouraged to join trips
and contribute to the project or knowledge and conservation of the
region. Flexibility will allow for a variety of other smaller
projects to be conducted during this project. This project plans also
allows eco-volunteers to assist throughout the data collection and
surveying methods. Assistance in wildlife survey, both on land and
while on the boat, will play a vital role in supplementing species
lists. Participation in the reef-health map and data collection, via
Manta Tow, will allow eco-volunteers to witness and interact with the
marine life. By allowing active participation in the data collection
and conservation, we will help to raise awareness,
appreciation, and promote protection of this unique area. 

With proper funding this
project could expand to the central and northern islands of the
Mergui Archipelago, allowing a complete assessment of the reefs,
underwater features, species lists, and future mooring sites. This
will play a vital role in the future of the islands. If the islands
are continually more accessible to visitor, it is crucial that
baseline data is collected, reef-health assessed and surveyed. This
will provide a basis in which to create both eco-tourist destinations
as well as marine protected areas.


By understanding the currently
conditions of these islands informed decisions in conservation and
protection can be made. One hope is to see a trans-border marine
protected area, between Thailand and Myanmar. Our assessment
of the southernmost islands can play a key role for the future of
this pristine and unique area.

Watch CBC news on Project Get Reel.


There are two big challenges facing Ontario today. So we created one dynamic solution.


1. When was the last time you watched a movie on VHS? Probably a while ago. The medium is obsolete. Today in Ontario there are 2.26 billion VHS tapes sitting in basements, stuffed in closets and collecting dust in storage rooms. 



Fact: VHS tapes are 80% recyclable but most end up in landfills. 


Fact: Plastics can take up to 1,000 years to biodegrade.


Recycling VHS tapes involves a lot of manual labour. Research shows that there is no way to automate the dismantling process and the work needs to be done by hand. So most VHS tapes just get tossed in the garbage and end up in landfills. We're solving this problem...and one more.
_____________________________________________________________________________
2. What do you think perpetual unemployment does to a person's physical and psychological well-being? Sustainable employment is so important. It helps people live fulfilling lives and contributes to happy, healthy communities.
Unfortunately it is extremely difficult for many Ontarians to find jobs. New immigrants, single parents and persons struggling with mental health can face barriers to employment—which can be detrimental to a person’s well-being and sense of self-worth.

3. So, how do you tackle landfills and unemployment? Here's how: 


This graphic is our triple bottom line. We created a sustainable way to recycle VHS tapes: employing individuals to dismantle them. But it doesn't end there. We will specifically employ individuals  facing barriers to employment. This strategy helps us save the environment and enrich the lives of fellow Ontarians.

Who are we?

We are GenesisXD, a group of creative professionals and passionate social innovators. We are determined to resolve this massive, neglected environmental issue and create jobs for people with barriers to employment. 



Our last award-winning social enterprise, KLINK Coffee, was recognized for its social impact. With Project Get Reel we are bringing that success to the next level.










 Why $25,000?

The funds raised will be used to get this project off the ground. We need your support for the basics. That means funding for costs associated with initial set up and hiring.  Our $25,000 figure was carefully calculated by an experienced financial analyst who factored in the set-up costs and support necessary for this project succeed through early-stage development.



By the way, the more you support Project Get Reel the more workers we can hire.



Project backers will receive incentives that include workshop tours, a limited edition special postcard, public acknowledgment and even advertising opportunities, subject to level of contribution.


Reel on a roll.
Once we start re-purposing reclaimable VHS
material, we’re on our way to a sustainable business. We’re also committed to
giving back. When Project Get Reel becomes a profitable business, we will use 50 per cent of our net profits to invest in new social enterprise projects. That way, we
keep the social good reel going.


The nitty gritty:



Once VHS materials are broken down by Project Get Reel employees, they can be recycled. Far away from any landfills.

Where are we now

I’m a web developer and a passionate kitchen gardener. Many of my friends longed to have a kitchen garden but could not make it happen due to time/ space constrains.
As a solution for their problem weekend farming initiative was started on 2013 December, where they could do farming  collectively in a plot. A spiritual organisation in Kerala provided land for cultivation. While the members did the farming activities on weekends; the plants were watered and taken care of on weekdays by an employee.  The expenses and the produce were equally split amidst the members.

They are colorful, easy to grow, pesticide-free, and beautiful in any landscape. The rapid decline in the populations of our Honey Bees and Monarch Butterflies is often in the media and the reality is devastating. Loss of habitat, pesticide use, disease and stress are contributing factors in their struggle to survive.We all have this information and we care, but can we help? Yes! We can plant perennial plants for pollinators! Our plants are field grown without neonicotinoids and other pesticides. Field grown plants are strong and healthy, and require less water and fertilizer than those grown in conventional, non-recyclable plastic nursery pots. Our overall process reduces the carbon footprint typically related to the horticulture industry. Our plants are primarily sold and shipped bare-root or in 4"" bio-degradable pots. They are available online until June 1, by phone, and at the Farmer's Markets in Stillwater and Bayport MN.Who We Are                                               I'm Bonnie Stone (left), a professional gardener and the owner of Stone Style Gardens & Bouquets which is the parent company of Perennials for Pollinators. I have been in the Horticultural industry since 2003 and a self-employed designer and Professional Gardener since 2007. I'm am MNLA Certified Professional with a Landscape Specialty, a member of the Minnesota State Horticultural Society, and licensed by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture. Through my time in gardens over the past 12 years I have seen first hand the decline in our pollinators, particularly our Monarchs and our Honey Bees. I believe strongly in improving the circumstances and opportunities for our pollinators through pesticide-free locally field grown perennials necessary for their survival.

My daughter Suzie (right) has loved gardening since she was old enough to walk. Her favorite flowers have always been the perennials and annuals that attract butterflies, and she now cares her own butterfly and vegetable gardens. She has had a brain injury since age 4 and has benefited from gardening in many ways. Now 17, she loves to see the honey bees in her vegie garden and the butterflies come and visit. She is excited to prepare the perennials for new homes, and to participate in the Farmer's Market! She hand packs all of our Clover Seed Bears in the ""Perks"" section of the campaign.
                                               
                                               Why We're Awesome

Our plants are FABULOUS and here's why; they are started in terracotta or biodegradable coir pots. Coir is made from coconut husks. From there they are transferred to our growing field and raised pesticide-free and without chemical sprays of any kind.  Field grown perennials are strong and healthy because their roots have room to spread out. They require less water and fertilizer than those grown in nursery pots because their nutrients are drawn from the soil. This process, combined with eliminating the use of plastic non-recyclable nursery pots, significantly reduces our carbon footprint.            We recognize that the chemical companies have done an excellent job convincing us that White Clover is a weed. White clover not only contributes nitrogen to our lawns and decreases the need for fertilizer, it is a primary food source for honey bees. The chemical companies also encourage eliminating stinging insects from your yard. All stinging insects are not ""bees"". Honey bees strongly prefer flowers to people, and have no interest in a picnic. Hornets and wasps on the other hand, are very aggressive and have unfortunately caused a reputation that honey bees don't deserve. We all have room in our yards for a bee friendly area, whether it's in a container or a corner of the lawn around a fence post.Dutch White Clover                                                       Habitat for our Monarchs has also reduced dramatically. We promote offering Asclepias in every landscape. Asclepias, commonly known as Milkweed is THE host plant for Monarch Butterflies. The butterflies lay one egg per plant and the caterpillars eat the leaves. They then visit the blooms for nourishment.                                        Asclepias Tuberosa 'Butterfly Weed'                                                      In addition to these, we offer a variety of gorgeous blooming plants that are naturally disease resistant, deer resistant, and are the preferred food source of honey bees and butterflies!What is our investment so far?We have done the necessary and unexciting administrative stuff including registration, licensing, insurance, and website. We have purchased plants and seeds that are sourced from non-GMO and organic growers, and organic soil for getting them started. We bring a personal touch to our plants by offering a gentle, chemical free start in terracotta or bio-degradable pots before they move to the field. The land space and terra cotta have been generously donated!                           How will we spend the money we are asking for? 

Registration and fees to sell our perennials at 2 local farmer's markets: $300


Marketing including business cards, banners, flyers: $300.00


Canopy, table, shelves and display tent for caterpillars at the farmer's market: $500


Additional plants, soil and biodegradable pots: $600


Materials for packing and shipping plants: $200

For a grand total of $1900 Money raised beyond our requested amount will go toward the purchase of water tanks for our growing site and adding a ""cart/check out"" feature with PayPal to our website. These are our ""Perk Shirts""",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

Unfortunately, our building is in need of a lot of repairs. We also have some exciting upgrades that will make our center an even better place to visit! We plan to complete phase 1 of the repairs and upgrades this spring. This includes a new floor in our main room, patching and painting the walls and ceiling, replacing a damaged window,  updating some displays and installing an interactive iPad kiosk, and building an amazing new habitat for our turtles. We have skilled volunteers willing to donate all of the labor involved in these projects. All we need now is the funding to cover material costs. Below is a detailed description of the work that needs to be done.</p><h3><b><br/></b></h3><h3><b>The New Turtle Habitat</b></h3><p>We have 7 live turtles at our center. One red-eared slider, one painted turtle, four box turtles, and a snapping turtle. Currently, each type of turtle has its own tank.

Unfortunately, our building is in need of a lot of repairs. We also have some exciting upgrades that will make our center an even better place to visit! We plan to complete phase 1 of the repairs and upgrades this spring. This includes a new floor in our main room, patching and painting the walls and ceiling, replacing a damaged window,  updating some displays and installing an interactive iPad kiosk, and building an amazing new habitat for our turtles. We have skilled volunteers willing to donate all of the labor involved in these projects. All we need now is the funding to cover material costs. Below is a detailed description of the work that needs to be done.The New Turtle HabitatWe have 7 live turtles at our center. One red-eared slider, one painted turtle, four box turtles, and a snapping turtle. Currently, each type of turtle has its own tank. The new habitat will have a 220 gallon pond (already donated) for the slider and painted turtles and a large land area around the pond for the box turtles. The snapping turtle will be kept separate in a very large aquarium. The new habitat will have live plants in the pond and on the land to make it more like their natural environment.

<b><b><h1>WHO'S BEHIND IT?</h1></b></b>
<p>The Good Beer Co. and Great Barrier
Beer are led by James Grugeon. James has more than 17 years experience in
leadership, business development, advocacy and social and environmental action.
He has worked as a board level strategist, leader and senior manager for a
range of public and private sector organisations, ranging from the UK FTSE 100
to start up social enterprises and was CEO of the UK’s oldest environmental
NGO. </p>
<p>Most recently James drove the
successful Better Power consumer action campaign with campaigning organisation GetUp
on behalf of Australia’s Greenest power company - Powershop (Greenpeace). James
helped over 12,500 GetUp members switch their power supplier to renewable
energy backed Powershop, raising over $1.2million for GetUp in the process and
helping Powershop start up in Victoria and NSW, in less than 12 months.</p>
<p>James will work directly with an
independent advisory board and charitable trust. The advisory board will guide
our work, review our profits and allocate funds to charity partners via The
Good Beer Co’s charitable trust.</p>
<p>Our charitable trust exists to oversee Good
Beer giving back. It’s an important part of how The Good Beer Co. ensures that
you can feel confident that when we say we give back to our charity partners,
we mean it. <br/><br/>You can find out more about The Good Beer Co. and Founder James Grugeon on our website: <a href=""http://www.thegoodbeerco.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thegoodbeerco.com.au</a></p>

surface waters all over the Earth there are perfectly-evolved solar power
factories called Diatoms. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Diatoms</span></a> are surface algae that are mostly made of
silica (glass). These single-celled creatures have been perfecting their
beautiful, energy efficient forms since the Jurassic era. In my research I have
discovered that these creatures are constantly putting out a small voltage, day
and night, with their microscopic, sturdy glass exoskeletons. I have been
working on a method to harvest and apply this free, naturally-produced
electricity. The goal of this campaign is to expand upon my research with the
purchase of materials and tools in order to apply this technology.<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DjjIr7NtxSNM%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FjjIr7NtxSNM&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>Yes, that's power from pondwater, upcycled kombucha bottles, and some hardware store materials.

capturing and testing diatoms I've discovered that there is a voltage produced
by each “cell” of pond water, typically a quart glass jar. This voltage can be increased when they are wired in series, just like conventional solar panels and batteries. Right now the
anodes (points where electrons can gather and be used) are made of steel and
copper, corresponding to negative and positive electrical charge. Diatoms are
found commonly in pond and salt water. It is my aim to utilize microscopes, computerized real-time multimeters, and more strictly controlled tank building materials (and
possible styles) to discern more about these creatures and why and how it is
this energy becomes available.  <br/><br/>
<p>Thus far I have read as much as
18.5V in direct sunlight, although the jars seem to read relatively high at
night when it is starry as well – versus when there is cloud cover. This odd
effect is one of many I hope to document and research. This is peculiar, but isn't new to biology - there is actually a known <a href=""http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/20070422222547data_trunc_sys.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fungus found in the old Chernobyl reactor that consumes gamma</a> radiation alone.  Could other ""everyday"" microbes be doing this too, at least in part?

surface waters all over the Earth there are perfectly-evolved solar power
factories called Diatoms. Diatoms are surface algae that are mostly made of
silica (glass). These single-celled creatures have been perfecting their
beautiful, energy efficient forms since the Jurassic era. In my research I have
discovered that these creatures are constantly putting out a small voltage, day
and night, with their microscopic, sturdy glass exoskeletons. I have been
working on a method to harvest and apply this free, naturally-produced
electricity. The goal of this campaign is to expand upon my research with the
purchase of materials and tools in order to apply this technology.Yes, that's power from pondwater, upcycled kombucha bottles, and some hardware store materials. The donor light for the battery charger cost $1.In
capturing and testing diatoms I've discovered that there is a voltage produced
by each “cell” of pond water, typically a quart glass jar. This voltage can be increased when they are wired in series, just like conventional solar panels and batteries. Right now the
anodes (points where electrons can gather and be used) are made of steel and
copper, corresponding to negative and positive electrical charge. Diatoms are
found commonly in pond and salt water. It is my aim to utilize microscopes, computerized real-time multimeters, and more strictly controlled tank building materials (and
possible styles) to discern more about these creatures and why and how it is
this energy becomes available.  
Thus far I have read as much as
18.5V in direct sunlight, although the jars seem to read relatively high at
night when it is starry as well – versus when there is cloud cover. This odd
effect is one of many I hope to document and research. This is peculiar, but isn't new to biology - there is actually a known fungus found in the old Chernobyl reactor that consumes gamma radiation alone.  Could other ""everyday"" microbes be doing this too, at least in part? The idea of a PV ""stellar cell"" is tantalizing to say the least.Scientists have already worked on something like this, harvesting energy from moss. The table to the right is embedded with moss in ceramic pots, with similar anodes/electrodes tapping the spare electrons from photosynthesis. The light is running off the moss, and the moss from a combination of light sources. Theoretically any plant can put out energy that can be used to power applications. What attracted me to working with diatoms, however, was their beautiful glass houses that they make out of silicon - the same material we make solar panels with.Apparently the most cutting edge 
nanoresearch in solar is using the power of these little power plants to
 design the next generation of solar panels. What these researchers are finding is that the glass houses these creatures build around themselves are ideal for this process of converting 
sunlight into energy. Using diatoms to create solar power this way is brilliant and absolutely will change the industry for the better. We aim to look at what they might be missing, however, as they are killing the architects of 
this technology, the diatoms themselves, in order to get pure power 
from their dead shells' natural ability. There may be benefits to a symbiotic relationship with living algae that this cut-and-dried approach may be missing. I want to put this energy to work while keeping the diatoms alive - even seeing if they can adapt over time to produce more energy.Perks added - get first dibs on algae reading lights and smartphone chargers for a sunny windowsill near you!Here are some of the questions we want to answer:

<div><b>Stretch Goals $700 000</b></div>
<div>After the completion of the 2015 Rolex Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race I will begin raising the funds for my next big project.</div>
<div>My goal is to become the first female to circumnavigate Antarctica solo, non-stop and unassisted, in a 100 % eco powered yacht and hopefully break the men's record while I am there.  I will be departing in Dec 2016 for this world record Antarctic Cup  campaign. Given that climate change is directly affecting this journey with the increased risk of ice it makes for another great platform to raise awareness of CLIMATE ACTION NOW.

<div style=""font-weight: bold;"">Facts on Climate Change</div>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Greenhouse gases</strong>, including <strong>carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor</strong>, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and warm the planet.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, the <strong>greenhouse effect is a good thing</strong>. Without greenhouse gases, the temperature on Earth would be too cold to support life. With too many, it would heat up beyond survivable levels. Earth is sometimes called the <strong>Goldilocks Planet</strong> because it is ""<strong>just right</strong>.""</p></li>
<li><p>Since <strong>1958</strong>, the <strong>amount of carbon dioxide</strong> in the atmosphere has been measured from an observatory on <strong>Mauna Loa</strong>, a volcano in Hawaii.</p></li>
<li><p>The pre-industrial concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was <strong>280 parts per million</strong> (ppm). As of March 2009, it has reached <strong>387 ppm</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Today, the amount of carbon dioxide is <strong>higher than at any time in the last 650,000 years.</strong> And the Earth's average temperature is <strong>increasing faster than ever before.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that temperatures will rise <strong>3.2 - 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit in the 21st century</strong>. Dramatically reducing levels of global warming pollution may keep the rise in the lower part of this range.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br/>Contributing to Climate Change</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The United States releases<strong> more carbon dioxide than any other country</strong>, though it is home to just <strong>five percent</strong> of the world's population. If everyone in the world lived the way people do in the U.S., it would take <strong>five Earths</strong> to provide enough resources for everyone!</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>amount of carbon dioxide </strong>emitted by the average family in the United States breaks down this way:</p></li>
<li>
<strong>One half</strong> from heating and cooling the house</li>
<li>
<strong>One quarter</strong> from transportation</li>
<li>
<strong>One quarter</strong> from using electricity</li>
<li> Burning <strong>one gallon</strong> of gasoline puts <strong>19 pounds </strong>of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br/>Effects on People, Wildlife and the Planet</strong></p>

</div></div>","Summary
I,  Lisa Blair, invite you to help me raise awareness of climate change and empower people to take CLIMATE ACTION NOW!  Get involved by sponsoring your unique post it note (just a few dollars will do) that you can add your message on climate action.  These notes will be collaged together and displayed as part of a digital wrap on the hull of my yacht.  The yacht will be raced by me in this years high profile Rolex Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race enabling me to combine my absolute love of sailing with my extreme passion for the planet.   Together we can deliver a very strong message which will receive a high level of media attention and create some meaningful conversations around this topic.
It is about being a part of the exciting Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race!It is about how many post it notes I can get on my yacht for the race!It is about conversation around our need for CLIMATE ACTION NOW!It is about capturing the attention of a nation!



How many notes can we get........1000? 5000? 10,000? or more.
Over my many years at sea I have noticed the impact that man made climate change has on our environment. For me personally the storms are more aggressive and less predictable, the absence of wild life when years earlier those seas were brimming with life and the increased risk of collision with ice as the glaciers keep melting.  These are all symptoms of man-made climate change.  What we know is that action needs to be taken and a greater awareness needs to be reached.
My project CLIMATE ACTION NOW is designed not to focus on the problem but instead on actions we are taking or can be taking towards a solution by utilising the power of 'note' sharing.  Purchase a perk or donate to get a post it note and add an action that you are already taking towards a better future.  This could be 'I ride to work for climate action', or 'I recycle for climate action'.  
All of your messages received before the 30th of November will be collaged together and transferred onto the hull of the yacht, lending a voice to the individual. It will have an impressive visual impact, attract media and empower others to take CLIMATE ACTION NOW! 
The vessel will be racing under the name ""Climate Action Now"" to further enhance coverage.  All post it notes received after the 30th Nov will be utilised on my website, social media and supporting platforms.  Together we can create a movement of messages.


What is man-made climate change?

The Opportunity 

The Race


Over the past 70 years, the Rolex Sydney Hobart has become an icon of Australia's summer sport.  Rarely in the world a yachting event attracts such a huge media coverage than the start of the Rolex Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race in Sydney Harbour.  This makes the Rolex Sydney to Hobart a perfect platform to raise awareness of this important issue. 
The Reach




Over 600 000 people converge on Sydney's foreshore to witness the race start.


The race start is broadcast Live at 12.20 pm on Boxing Day by Channel 7, a 90 minute program.


The race start will be webcast on Yahoo7, ABC TV will document the race down the eastern seaboard.

I will be documenting challenges before and during the race and will post blogs on the Australian Sailing and Yachting magazine's website www.mysailing.com.au These will be shared around my website and social media outlets.


The Power of Post it Notes
I want to focus on actions we can all take towards a solution.  'Climate Action Now' was born as a means to spread this message, to empower communities to become personally involved and give individuals a voice on climate change.  This is to be achieved through the 'post it note' campaign.
Since the 60's people have been using post it notes to create messages.  Tapping in to this established movement of messages we will be using the strength in numbers method to reach a greater audience.  The yacht, 'Climate Action Now' is to be branded with your messages on post it notes and will look something like the image below.

These notes will encase the boat in a digital wrap of positive actions that you, the people, are already taking towards climate action. Messages like 'I ride to work for climate action', or 'I recycle for climate action' creating a simple sharing of ideas to reduce emissions in everyday life will be carried across the oceans in a unique symbolic gesture indicating your strong support towards CLIMATE ACTION NOW and inspire others to take action. How many notes can we collect for maximum impact and conversation.

The Sailor
In my 10 years of sailing I have achieved many things including circumnavigating in 2011-12 in the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race, working for Hugo Boss on their open 60 racing yacht and sailing solo to New Zealand and back.  I have clocked up over 50 000 nm of ocean racing making me more than qualified for the Sydney to Hobart. I also hold a commercial Yacht Master Offshore, Master 5 and Marine Engine Driver 3. I will skipper the race with a total crew of 8 people.

The Boat
I have recently purchased, with the help of my family, the yacht Funnel-Web, a Robert Hick designed open 50 racing yacht.  It was commissioned by Ivan Macfadyen to compete in the Vendee Globe - a solo non-stop and unassisted around the world yacht race.  She is a truly competitive ocean racing yacht that will make a large impact.




Why $25 000?

All money received will go towards aiding my efforts to raise awareness of Climate Action.  Here is a list of what your money will be used for, please keep in mind that this is the bare minimum that I need for the boat.


Hull Wrap $10 000
Branding on the Sails $5 000
Insurance for race $5 000
Anti Foul (to make the boat fast) $4 000
Bobs and bits that I need to comply with race requirements $1 000

There are always more costs involved with a campaign like this so any surplus funds raised will be going towards those costs, printing and marketing of the message Climate Action Now.

Stretch Goals $700 000
After the completion of the 2015 Rolex Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race I will begin raising the funds for my next big project.
My goal is to become the first female to circumnavigate Antarctica solo, non-stop and unassisted, in a 100 % eco powered yacht and hopefully break the men's record while I am there.  I will be departing in Dec 2016 for this world record Antarctic Cup  campaign. Given that climate change is directly affecting this journey with the increased risk of ice it makes for another great platform to raise awareness of CLIMATE ACTION NOW. Any left over funds will be going towards this campaign.

More on the Science of Climate Change.

Facts on Climate Change

Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and warm the planet.
In general, the greenhouse effect is a good thing. Without greenhouse gases, the temperature on Earth would be too cold to support life. With too many, it would heat up beyond survivable levels. Earth is sometimes called the Goldilocks Planet because it is ""just right.""
Since 1958, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been measured from an observatory on Mauna Loa, a volcano in Hawaii.
The pre-industrial concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million (ppm). As of March 2009, it has reached 387 ppm.
Today, the amount of carbon dioxide is higher than at any time in the last 650,000 years. And the Earth's average temperature is increasing faster than ever before.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that temperatures will rise 3.2 - 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit in the 21st century. Dramatically reducing levels of global warming pollution may keep the rise in the lower part of this range.

Contributing to Climate Change

The United States releases more carbon dioxide than any other country, though it is home to just five percent of the world's population. If everyone in the world lived the way people do in the U.S., it would take five Earths to provide enough resources for everyone!
The amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the average family in the United States breaks down this way:

One half from heating and cooling the house

One quarter from transportation

One quarter from using electricity
 Burning one gallon of gasoline puts 19 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Effects on People, Wildlife and the Planet

Average sea level is expected to rise 7 - 23 inches before the end of this century - and perhaps as much as 31 inches (if, as some models predict, the rate of ice melting from Greenland and Antarctica increases).
All but 100 of 1,100 glaciers researched are receding (more ice melts in summer than re-forms the next winter).
The current pace of global average temperature rise puts approximately 20 to 30 percent of plant and animal species at increased risk of extinction.
Rain forest destruction contributes to climate change. That's because trees store carbon dioxide as they grow. Clearing and burning forests releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Coral reefs are as important to marine wildlife as rainforests are to land-based wildlife. Rising seawater temperatures threaten their survival. The world lost about 16% of all coral reefs in 1998, the second hottest year on record.

<span style=""font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;"">How we can Save the Bee</span><br/>
</h3>
<div></div>
<span>As you are probably aware, the world’s bee population is under threat. Around the globe, colonies are declining drastically and that’s bad news for more than honey fans. Bees are directly responsible for a third of all the food we eat. Without their pollination, things will get very serious. But we want to ensure that never happens, but we need your help.</span>
</div><div><span><br/></span></div><div>So who are we? Andy Cory you may have already met in the video above. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">He has been a beekeeper for over 35 years and is a specialist in queen bee
breeding. He owns and directly oversees 3,000 hives in New Zealand and 1,000 hives in
Niue. He is widely considered one of the Pacific’s leading apiculturists. </span>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p>When Andy first took on these bees located on the Pacific island of Niue 15 years ago, he never dreamt that the world's stock of honey bees would subsequently get into such peril.  H<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">e also never thought that
he would be left with the healthiest last known significant and sufficiently isolated stock of Italian honey bees (</span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Apis
mellifera ligustica</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">) in the region, and </span>likely <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the world. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<span>They were brought to Niue many years ago, well before the major honey bee diseases, parasites and chemicals afflicting today’s bees could affect them. They’ve since been effectively isolated in a tropical paradise for bees.</span>
</div><div><span><br/></span></div><div>
<b><i>""Niue has no honey bee diseases or pests of quarantine
concern and arguably has the highest bee health status of the Pacific Island
countries which export bee products to New Zealand."" </i> </b>Niue Honey Bee Disease Survey (SPC) July 2013. </div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431751794/eg8nch3cfzxhzjq36c5w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Thankfully, he persevered through the many trials associated with Pacific beekeeping, even surviving a huge cyclone in 2004, and kept the bees alive! It was also a bonus that Andy had the only bees on Niue and that they were purely of Italian stock, so there were no issues of cross breeding with other undesirable strains of honey bee. Additionally, Niue's relative isolation, limited ports and tourism and ideal size (not too big and not to small - the 'Goldilocks' factor) had made it the ideal location for a ""natural and near quarantine"". Consequently, Andy already had an informal bee sanctuary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nevertheless, as the rest of the world's honey bees have become increasingly threatened by a host of causes, sometimes summed up in the term ""colony collapse disorder"" (CCD), Andy decided <b>the</b> <b>time had come to convert the Niue operation into a formal and internationally recognised Global Bee Sanctuary. </b>Discussions with the Government of Niue and other potential partners started accordingly. As other remedies are explored for solving the international bee crisis, a bee sanctuary on Niue is critical to ensure there will always be healthy and protected stock from which to draw from in the future - in effect, insurance against the continuing decline of the honey bee and the resulting impact on global food security.</p>

We put our heads together and came up with the plan to create a ""Save the Bee"" retail honey brand to self-fund this important initiative. However, getting sufficient sales was going to take some time and the honey bees were coming under increasing threat (with an hugely alarming 42% mortality rate in the US over the last year!). So, we needed to fast-track the initiative, and that's where you come in . . .<br/><p><br/></p>

<h2>Be part of building a Global Bee Sanctuary</h2>
<div>
This campaign is an opportunity to play
a unique and pivotal role in <b>the creation of a Global Bee Sanctuary through an</b> <b>innovative
‘social business’ model</b>,
thereby promoting regional agricultural productivity, environment and
biodiversity protection, and ultimately safeguarding global food security. 
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>We are looking for your help to:</p>
<ul>
<li>facilitate the timely development of a <b>Global Bee Sanctuary </b>on Niue with the aim of safeguarding the genetic stock of the Italian bee.</li>

<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>From where the social venture stands today, it is proceeding forward in two broad phases:</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Phase 1: strengthen and grow the current apiculture operation on

<p><b>Phase 2: develop the ‘Global Bee Sanctuary’</b> and begin to export live bee stocks and/or genetic breeding material to other Pacific Island countries, as well as other key food producing countries.

<p>The Phase 1 funding target of this campaign is $160,000, which will be assigned to the following areas:</p>
<p>$15,000 - <b>Biosecurity enhancements</b> (training and communications: the Government of Niue already does a great job of banning all honey and bee stock imports).</p>
<p>$25,000 - <b>Retail 'Save The Bee' honey bottles</b> (we have had some initial design funding from Pacific Island Trade and Invest, hence the great bottle design you see in this campaign. Nevertheless, for the first run of retail sales, we still need to source, test and buy the bottles, pack and distribute - all using organic certified processes).</p>
<p>$25,000 - <b>New hives</b> (to start the replacement of all the old hives on the island, eventually building to a maximum sustainable number of 4,000).</p>
<p>$30,000 - <b>Honey factory upgrade </b>(the old honey factory needs new floors and ceilings, plus the upgrade of the 1960s vintage honey and wax processing equipment).</p>
<p>$25,000 - <b>Truck</b> (ever tried to keep a truck going in the Pacific?! We need a new and reliable truck to make sure we can keep pace with the productivity requirements as the venture grows).</p>
<p>$20,000 - <b>R&amp;D into Niue honey bioactive properties</b> (there is anecdotal evidence that Niue honey might have valuable and unique bioactive components).</p>
<p>$20,000 - <b>Disease Audit</b> (the bees on Niue are inspected by an external agency every few years, but we need to bring the frequency up to an annual inspection in order to retain export clearance to New Zealand and from there to the rest of the world).</p>
<p>If our funding goal is not reached, we would concentrate the funds that were raised on the first two categories above (biosecurity and bottles), and continue to press on with the project! We won't stop now, the stakes are too high!</p>
<p>In the case of raising more funds than the campaign target, we would be able to stretch straight into the subsequent regional and global phases of the project, instead of having to wait until the honey sales created the necessary funds. FYI - certification for live bee exports alone could run close to a 7 figure sum!</p>

</ul>
<div>If honey bee stocks continue to decline, and especially in the context of conflicting messages about the cause(s), we need to do more than just plant flowers (important as this is). We need to urgently protect the best honey bees that remain, and hopefully we will never have to call on them as a result of an absolutely catastrophic situation . . . albeit things are pretty bad at the moment!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<ul> </ul>
<div></div>
<h2>What Can Go Wrong</h2>
<div>The biggest risks to us are biosecurity related, particularly the introduction of the varroa mite and/or European foulbrood (EFB), the former being a setback to productivity (and organic certification) and the latter being a deal-breaker for entry and/or transit of live bees via New Zealand (as all Niuean exports go via Auckland, NZ). Consequently, the requirement of getting biosecurity levels up to the maximum possible is essential. The Government of Niue has done an excellent job in strengthening biosecurity measures to ban the import of all bees and bee products. They are also positive about putting their weight in behind the emerging Global Bee Sanctuary plans and we are currently discussing how to support each other during this next phase in a public-private partnership.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We had a recent scare when a minor case of American foulbrood (AFB) was found, the first in eight years. The few affected hives were dealt with, but it was a salutary lesson of the need to enhance biosecurity arrangements and renew old gear. Indeed, one of the interim goals as we progress through the project phases is for Niue to be able to declare itself the first country to have eradicated AFB. <i>Nosema</i> has also been present on the Island, but has had negligible effect on the health of the bees and will be reduced through re-queening and renewal of hive parts as one of the short term goals of this project.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Agricultural in the Pacific is always under threat from cyclones. As previously mentioned, Andy nearly lost all the bees in 2004. He is grateful to the French navy who at the time brought him sugar to feed as a supplement until native vegetation recovered. Consequently, to mitigate against the risk of losing all the bees in the aftermath of future cyclones, we now have a sufficient store of organic sugar on Island.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<h2>This job is too big for just Andy</h2>
<p>Thanks so much for taking the time to read through our campaign! We trust you can see that we are passionate about this critical project and that it is of real significance to all of us. We are looking for equally passionate supporters who can join with us on this journey. As Andy often likes to say,""it's been a 15 year love affair with the bees on Niue!"" He didn't expect to have to be the custodian for this genetic stock when he first came to Niue, but he has diligently and faithfully performed his duty . . . now he needs your help to keep them safe and available for future generations.</p>
<p>We hope you found a perk that suits you, but if not you can still play a very important role by making as much noise about this campaign as possible. Please tell your friends and colleagues (and bosses) about this important campaign .  . . there are even some Indiegogo share tools designed especially to assist you. As you can imagine, Andy is better on the bees than on the computer. So those of you with technical and social media expertise, <b>let's get this campaign going viral</b> (with the social media . . . not the bees!).</p>
<p>Thanks again and we hope to see you in Niue sometime . . . and remember to SAVE THE BEE!</p>

</div></div>","How we can Save the Bee


As you are probably aware, the world’s bee population is under threat. Around the globe, colonies are declining drastically and that’s bad news for more than honey fans. Bees are directly responsible for a third of all the food we eat. Without their pollination, things will get very serious. But we want to ensure that never happens, but we need your help.
So who are we? Andy Cory you may have already met in the video above. He has been a beekeeper for over 35 years and is a specialist in queen bee
breeding. He owns and directly oversees 3,000 hives in New Zealand and 1,000 hives in
Niue. He is widely considered one of the Pacific’s leading apiculturists. 

When Andy first took on these bees located on the Pacific island of Niue 15 years ago, he never dreamt that the world's stock of honey bees would subsequently get into such peril.  He also never thought that
he would be left with the healthiest last known significant and sufficiently isolated stock of Italian honey bees (Apis
mellifera ligustica) in the region, and likely the world. 

They were brought to Niue many years ago, well before the major honey bee diseases, parasites and chemicals afflicting today’s bees could affect them. They’ve since been effectively isolated in a tropical paradise for bees.

""Niue has no honey bee diseases or pests of quarantine
concern and arguably has the highest bee health status of the Pacific Island
countries which export bee products to New Zealand.""  Niue Honey Bee Disease Survey (SPC) July 2013. 

Thankfully, he persevered through the many trials associated with Pacific beekeeping, even surviving a huge cyclone in 2004, and kept the bees alive! It was also a bonus that Andy had the only bees on Niue and that they were purely of Italian stock, so there were no issues of cross breeding with other undesirable strains of honey bee. Additionally, Niue's relative isolation, limited ports and tourism and ideal size (not too big and not to small - the 'Goldilocks' factor) had made it the ideal location for a ""natural and near quarantine"". Consequently, Andy already had an informal bee sanctuary.

Nevertheless, as the rest of the world's honey bees have become increasingly threatened by a host of causes, sometimes summed up in the term ""colony collapse disorder"" (CCD), Andy decided the time had come to convert the Niue operation into a formal and internationally recognised Global Bee Sanctuary. Discussions with the Government of Niue and other potential partners started accordingly. As other remedies are explored for solving the international bee crisis, a bee sanctuary on Niue is critical to ensure there will always be healthy and protected stock from which to draw from in the future - in effect, insurance against the continuing decline of the honey bee and the resulting impact on global food security.



""In summary, the bees were the healthiest bees the
author has seen for a long time and this is supported by laboratory tests."" Niue Honey Bee Disease Survey (SPC) July 2013.But creating and funding a Bee Sanctuary, with the aim of eventually being able to potentially export clean, healthy and gentle bee stock to other countries was going to take some time. We put our heads together and came up with the plan to create a ""Save the Bee"" retail honey brand to self-fund this important initiative. However, getting sufficient sales was going to take some time and the honey bees were coming under increasing threat (with an hugely alarming 42% mortality rate in the US over the last year!). So, we needed to fast-track the initiative, and that's where you come in . . .

Be part of building a Global Bee Sanctuary

This campaign is an opportunity to play
a unique and pivotal role in the creation of a Global Bee Sanctuary through an innovative
‘social business’ model,
thereby promoting regional agricultural productivity, environment and
biodiversity protection, and ultimately safeguarding global food security. 

We are looking for your help to:

facilitate the timely development of a Global Bee Sanctuary on Niue with the aim of safeguarding the genetic stock of the Italian bee.
help fast-track the development of the existing apiculture operation from a regional wholesale honey sales organisation to a self-funded globally branded “save the bee” retail bee product sales organisation.
pursue opportunities to spread Niue's honeybee stock. Initially, into other suitable Pacific Island nations as livelihood projects with other NGO and regional agency partners, and then into Northern Hemisphere countries in order to augment pollination services.










Why crowdfunding
The purpose of this crowdfunding campaign is to raise funds to fast-track the transition of the current commercial wholesale venture into a self-funding retail-based social venture. In doing so, the foundation will be laid for generating future revenue sufficient to create and sustain a Global Bee Sanctuary.


From where the social venture stands today, it is proceeding forward in two broad phases:
Phase 1: strengthen and grow the current apiculture operation on
Niue and develop export markets in order to generate revenue, build partnerships and learning. And provide a solid foundation and financial resources sufficient to underwrite the creation and sustain the operation of a Global Bee Sanctuary.

Phase 2: develop the ‘Global Bee Sanctuary’ and begin to export live bee stocks and/or genetic breeding material to other Pacific Island countries, as well as other key food producing countries.
This is where the venture shifts to regional and then global in its impact.
The Phase 1 funding target of this campaign is $160,000, which will be assigned to the following areas:
$15,000 - Biosecurity enhancements (training and communications: the Government of Niue already does a great job of banning all honey and bee stock imports).
$25,000 - Retail 'Save The Bee' honey bottles (we have had some initial design funding from Pacific Island Trade and Invest, hence the great bottle design you see in this campaign. Nevertheless, for the first run of retail sales, we still need to source, test and buy the bottles, pack and distribute - all using organic certified processes).
$25,000 - New hives (to start the replacement of all the old hives on the island, eventually building to a maximum sustainable number of 4,000).
$30,000 - Honey factory upgrade (the old honey factory needs new floors and ceilings, plus the upgrade of the 1960s vintage honey and wax processing equipment).
$25,000 - Truck (ever tried to keep a truck going in the Pacific?! We need a new and reliable truck to make sure we can keep pace with the productivity requirements as the venture grows).
$20,000 - R&D into Niue honey bioactive properties (there is anecdotal evidence that Niue honey might have valuable and unique bioactive components).
$20,000 - Disease Audit (the bees on Niue are inspected by an external agency every few years, but we need to bring the frequency up to an annual inspection in order to retain export clearance to New Zealand and from there to the rest of the world).
If our funding goal is not reached, we would concentrate the funds that were raised on the first two categories above (biosecurity and bottles), and continue to press on with the project! We won't stop now, the stakes are too high!
In the case of raising more funds than the campaign target, we would be able to stretch straight into the subsequent regional and global phases of the project, instead of having to wait until the honey sales created the necessary funds. FYI - certification for live bee exports alone could run close to a 7 figure sum!

food security to an increasingly concerned international audience.


Establishment of a Pacific education and research centre to further
timely R&D into bee health and integrate with other complementary
initiatives.


Augmentation of regional agricultural productivity initiatives through
‘re-stocking’ the region from a pure source of gentle bee stock.


Provision of vital livelihoods for Pacific Island communities, while also
spreading Italian bee stock.


Contribute towards native bush regeneration, thereby mitigating the
effects of global warming and soil degeneration.


Expansion of revenue opportunities for landowners with hive rental
arrangements.

Additional local employment opportunities as a result of expanded activities and product development, as well as via the creation of retail production facilities on Island, such as bottling and other value-added supply chain activity.
Provision of an alternative source of revenue for the government of Niue as a recipient of social venture donations (such revenue could be used to enhance and underwrite some of the Island’s biosecurity arrangements, removing such expense from recurrent budget expenditure).

If honey bee stocks continue to decline, and especially in the context of conflicting messages about the cause(s), we need to do more than just plant flowers (important as this is). We need to urgently protect the best honey bees that remain, and hopefully we will never have to call on them as a result of an absolutely catastrophic situation . . . albeit things are pretty bad at the moment!


 

What Can Go Wrong
The biggest risks to us are biosecurity related, particularly the introduction of the varroa mite and/or European foulbrood (EFB), the former being a setback to productivity (and organic certification) and the latter being a deal-breaker for entry and/or transit of live bees via New Zealand (as all Niuean exports go via Auckland, NZ). Consequently, the requirement of getting biosecurity levels up to the maximum possible is essential. The Government of Niue has done an excellent job in strengthening biosecurity measures to ban the import of all bees and bee products. They are also positive about putting their weight in behind the emerging Global Bee Sanctuary plans and we are currently discussing how to support each other during this next phase in a public-private partnership.

We had a recent scare when a minor case of American foulbrood (AFB) was found, the first in eight years. The few affected hives were dealt with, but it was a salutary lesson of the need to enhance biosecurity arrangements and renew old gear. Indeed, one of the interim goals as we progress through the project phases is for Niue to be able to declare itself the first country to have eradicated AFB. Nosema has also been present on the Island, but has had negligible effect on the health of the bees and will be reduced through re-queening and renewal of hive parts as one of the short term goals of this project.

Agricultural in the Pacific is always under threat from cyclones. As previously mentioned, Andy nearly lost all the bees in 2004. He is grateful to the French navy who at the time brought him sugar to feed as a supplement until native vegetation recovered. Consequently, to mitigate against the risk of losing all the bees in the aftermath of future cyclones, we now have a sufficient store of organic sugar on Island.



This job is too big for just Andy
Thanks so much for taking the time to read through our campaign! We trust you can see that we are passionate about this critical project and that it is of real significance to all of us. We are looking for equally passionate supporters who can join with us on this journey. As Andy often likes to say,""it's been a 15 year love affair with the bees on Niue!"" He didn't expect to have to be the custodian for this genetic stock when he first came to Niue, but he has diligently and faithfully performed his duty . . . now he needs your help to keep them safe and available for future generations.
We hope you found a perk that suits you, but if not you can still play a very important role by making as much noise about this campaign as possible. Please tell your friends and colleagues (and bosses) about this important campaign .  . . there are even some Indiegogo share tools designed especially to assist you. As you can imagine, Andy is better on the bees than on the computer. So those of you with technical and social media expertise, let's get this campaign going viral (with the social media . . . not the bees!).
Thanks again and we hope to see you in Niue sometime . . . and remember to SAVE THE BEE!",11.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Research </h3>
<p>We're serious about carbon management and being net positive. So as well as developing building materials, we've done a lot of research into hemp farming and processing and we work with groups of farmers to help them to develop regional industries.<br/></p>
<p></p>

<p>The aims of our research were to develop a product and identify a process that would:</p>
<p><b>a)</b> maximise the renewable resource (hemp) in the building material</p>
<p><b>b)</b> minimise the energy-intensive heated and mined materials (limes) in the Binder</p>
<p><b>c)</b> produce a carbon neutral building material.  </p>

<p>This is an opportunity for you to support us, as well as to organise a workshop in your regional area at a suitable site. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ideal if you live in an area where people are interested in the emerging hemp industry and hemp building, but getting all of you to a capital city is expensive and/or has a huge carbon footprint!

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Your support will enable us to continue to be Australian Green Industry Drivers, further developing our model for regional production supporting local farmers.  You will also be directly enabling the transition to industry based on carbon rather than fossil fuels. If our infrastructure is viewed as a potential way to create carbon sinks, we can make a massive difference.</p>
<p>Each time we can engage a hemp farmer to grow and process half a hectare of industrial hemp for a small building, we collectively lock up 2 - 4 tonnes of harmful carbon emissions.  In Southwold in the UK a 2400 sq m hemp lime brewery and distribution centre has no refrigeration. 500 tonnes of carbon are locked into this building. It is the UK's greenest warehouse. Lime hemp’s manufacture  produces one-tenth of the carbon dioxide generated in making a conventional concrete block. Please support us to make a green economy for Australia real.</p>
<p>Other positive impacts you will help to realise are regional development and the creation of the jobs of the future, like in Dungog in the NSW Hunter Valley where a disused timber mill has been converted to a Hemp Mill producing the hemp for an ecovillage closeby.  We have no direct financial interest in farming however we are actively involved in helping this community and other regional communities to build industry based on hemp. </p>
<p>Hopefully we'll also make a start on improving Aboriginal housing in remote communities.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>
<p>A major risk for the Australian hemp industry is investment from overseas corporations dominating the industry. Imported European subsidised materials with a higher carbon footprint will compete with the emerging Australian hemp farming and processing industries if we don't support our farmers and processors to grow our own industry . </p>
<p>We have worked for many years developing and perfecting our materials, however we are committed to continuous improvement and we hope to improve and innovate informed by your feedback. By pledging to support this innovation you are  making Green Industry possible - allowing cutting edge technology to be realised.</p>
<p><b>MANUFACTURING:</b> We are working closely with a manufacturer who has been able to produce our materials at a high quality so we have already resolved many of the manufacturing challenges. However, to produce on a larger scale will require increased tooling and production equipment. This is a complex transition for a small company.</p>
<p><b>FULFILMENT: </b> </p>
<p>We have already co-sponsored and run two workshops for Aboriginal participants to construct a small hemp masonry (hemp lime) cabin with some support from NSW Trade and Investment). Our goal from these preliminary workshops was to gauge interest and whether we could offer a valuable contribution. </p>
<p>Two of our staff are qualified VET trainers and we both have experience in working  in education with Aboriginal communities. Ben has worked for the past 5 years in Alice Springs, NT project managing environmental and community projects. </p>
<p>As a staff member of North Coast TAFE  Klara, the company's General Manager won the North Coast Institute Staff Award for Excellence in Aboriginal Community Partnerships in 2010 and was the project manager for a  2014 project ""The Trickle Effect – Working flexibly with Aboriginal communities to build capability in resource efficiency"" which was a finalist in the Social Responsibility category of the Green Gown Awards Australasia</p>

<div>
<br/><p><b>PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS:</b> Extensive testing of our materials has taken place over the past 10 years, however we are continuously researching and improving aspects of our products and supply chain, including packaging and distribution.

<div>Please support us by sharing our campaign around your networks.

At the same time we need better materials that we can sustainably use and produce. 
We also need to harvest carbon from the atmosphere because greenhouse gases are at unsafe levels."" 




Growing Industrial hemp for its biomass is one
of the cleanest, fastest and most economical ways to harvest carbon from the atmosphere. It's multifunctional.  It also adds to soil carbon and improves the
soil.   


Hemp buildings lock up the carbon rich biomass and create carbon sinks. When the hemp is regionally sourced, this combination is hard to beat


Although we're still small, through partnering with farmers, we've supplied the materials into most of the hemp buildings in Australia and for a Gallery in the Singapore Botanic Gardens.  We're the lead Australian developer of certified hemp-lime construction materials. We've been waiting for state legislations and the farming
industry to catch up with us!




Because we know that sustainably farmed hemp and regional models are the best long term option, we've made it a part of our core business to work closely with
regional Australian farmers and processors. 
Our goal is to trigger large scale carbon farming, better farming practices and new Australian businesses, by encouraging farming of high biomass hemp crops for construction projects. 
As a company we're at a critical time. We have a growing list of clients planning builds, however from the point of someone being interested, to actually starting a build takes quite a long time. We need to grow so we can move from small to larger scale manufacturing because of that growing interest. 
We're asking for your support to educate Australians about the benefits of hemp building, hemp farming and the hemp industry. A huge challenge for this industry is the misinformation about Hemp which is a hangover from prohibition. We are working to develop truly sustainable, regional industry. The only way to do that is support Australia's regional hemp farmers, while we develop. 
We'd also like to kickstart a social housing project with your help, where we'll share our knowledge of hemp building skills using the materials you donate.
You'll notice most of our perks are educational ...
*Please note Australian contributors will need to set up a paypal account which you can do while you process your contribution! 








OUR MATERIALS

lock up tonnes of harvested carbon in buildings 
create a vapour-permeable construction envelope that means healthier indoor air quality
provide excellent thermal insulation, light thermal mass and great humidity control. These all add up to energy savings
are simple to build with. Hemp building requires care but the skills are easy to learn.
reduce the load on foundations because they're light weight 
are recyclable - demolished  hemp lime walls can be reused or used as mulch which will slowly decompose. 




""So far the thermal performance has been
great. We’ve had quite warm days over summer with only occasional ceiling
fan use being enough to keep comfortable. We haven’t been through the whole winter yet, but have had
nights around 6 degrees.The gas hydronic controlled underfloor heating is set
to 16 degrees and never comes on at that temp.We sometimes set the kids’ room
to about 20 degrees, and it comes on occasionally in the night. ""
(Home owners, Hazelbrook, Blue Mtns, NSW)

""When you enter the home you can instantly experience
how the hemp keeps the home cool. This past Northern Rivers summer there were
plenty of 40 C plus days and because there have also been rains, the humidity
has been peaking, so a building made from a breathable material that mitigates
humidity is ideal."" (Home owners, Mullumbimby, NSW) 

WHAT WE DO




We provide consultancy services. We also deliver training to Architects, Building Designers, Builders and Owner builders to make sure that our products are accessible to the broader community.
We've got a strong record in R & D 
Our materials significantly reduce ongoing operational energy use in commercial and residential buildings. That translates into fewer greenhouse emissions from construction, as well as fewer greenhouse gas emissions from the building's reduced energy  use.

We lobby government and work in industry associations to support farmers across the broader hemp industry.
We support small to medium scale Australian Farmers to stay on their farms

We're definitely interested in mainstreaming hemp construction but we're also  engaged in working effectively with global transition groups and Indigenous communities who are looking for sustainable housing solutions.
We're big on education and knowledge sharing.

Our Approach
Australian Hemp Masonry Pty Ltd’s work spans across the hemp construction and hemp farming sectors.  Our goal is to contribute to a smooth transition from a fossil fuel to a carbon based economy. 
We have done most of our work in Australia but we did train the crew and supply the materials for Singapore's first zero energy public building, the Green Gallery and Heritage Museum in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. 


Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong officially opened the Building saying “I am, happy that many companies are supporting the environment as part of your corporate social responsibility, like CDL Green Gallery – a commitment to eco-friendly development and practices.""




Our Research 
We're serious about carbon management and being net positive. So as well as developing building materials, we've done a lot of research into hemp farming and processing and we work with groups of farmers to help them to develop regional industries.


Although life cycle analysis of products is only starting to be broadly discussed, truly sustainable products consider all the steps in their manufacture and distribution.
The Lime Binder and Hemp lime Render products we supply for new builds and retrofits are certified and were developed and tested over a 6 year period at the Australian Centre for Construction Innovation at UNSW and for a further 6 years in the field. 
The aims of our research were to develop a product and identify a process that would:
a) maximise the renewable resource (hemp) in the building material
b) minimise the energy-intensive heated and mined materials (limes) in the Binder
c) produce a carbon neutral building material.  
Australian Hemp Masonry is amongst the most sustainable Hemp Lime Construction materials available globally.


What We Need & What You Get
We need your support to keep educating and advocating to ensure that we develop a sustainable hemp farming industry in Australia while we continue in our development of further Hemp Building materials like Hemp lime prefabricated panels, especially for social housing. 
We are also asking for your support to kickstart a social housing project.
Through supporting us you will also indirectly reap the benefits of carbon abatement, cleaner air and cleaner water! 
As well you'll be contributing to a positive future for future generations and the planet. Thank you!

 


$10 - Gifting - the Hemp Brick 

Thank you for your support.  Help us to hand on skills and make a contribution. 
These funds will be kept separate and your contribution will go towards the hemp lime materials for a social housing project in NSW, QLD or NT.  This project is about handing on skills and the initiative has come from discussions over some years with a number of Aboriginal Elders in communities in NSW, Qld and NT.  
The cost of the AHMC materials for walls and subfloor and roofing insulation,  and AHMC Hemp lime Render for a 100 sq m building  (250mm thick walls, 150mm subfloor and 150mm roofing insulation) plus 3.7 tonnes of Hemp Hurd (from partner farmer) is approx $18,000. 
This will create a comfortable, breathable living area (and carbon sink) which is thermally efficient, mitigates humidity well, provides a healthy living environment and will require less energy to run than conventional building materials. It will also be a carbon sink ...  and trigger more carbon farming ...
Although this is only a beginning it puts us in a great position to find other partners. A simple kit frame, windows, doors, fit out and heading out in a shipping container will require other partners and sponsors. However we have good networking skills. We also believe that a lot of Australians feel that there is an urgent need to improve the housing options in Aboriginal communities and your support will enable us to leverage additional funding for projects to start to happen. Working to support social housing is a part of our Vision

</div></div>","Bringing 'balance' to Swansea; an eco-friendly and sustainable bulk food/zero waste shop
The statistics are there for all to see;

300 million tonnes of plastic produced every year
Half of that plastic is single use
8 million tonnes of plastic dumped into our oceans every year
Every animal washed up on U.K. beaches found to have digested plastic

The list is endless, but we still carry on like nothing is wrong.
I have a daughter who loves all animals, most notably Dolphins. While watching Blue Planet II as many of us have, my eyes were opened to the mass destruction that we are causing our planet.
It was then that I realised I had to make changes in my life and encourage others to do the same.
With your support I will bring 'balance' to Swansea.
It will be an opportunity to give those of us who want to create a more sustainable and healthier planet the products to do so.
Supplying over 100 bulk foods including nuts, seeds, lentils, rice, pasta, herbs, spices, oils and more that you can take away in your own reusable containers.
We will also stock refill household cleaning and personal hygiene items that are kind to both you and our planet.
Finally we will have lots of hardware including reusable water bottles and coffee cups, bamboo toothbrushes and cutlery sets plus everyone's favourite the metal straw!
I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for your interest and your support and also on behalf of all zero waste stores around the world because we know people desperately want to make these changes and we hope to help you all on your journey to zero waste.


""How can we help?""
What a great question!
We are currently searching for the perfect location to bring a bulk food zero waste option to as many people of Swansea as possible.

We already have personal investment but with your donations we can go one step further and get the best food dispensers, filling them to the brim with lots of amazing and healthy products.
We will also be able to buy state of the art commercial weighing scales to help make the buying process quicker.
Finally we hope to have the latest gadgets in our shop in order to provide our customers with the likes of freshly ground nut butters and nut/oat based milks.

If we don't reach our entire funding goal the food and dispensers will of course be our priority.

""We'll scratch your back...""
We have some amazing perks to help you start your journey to zero waste.

From your name on our 'foundations wall' to 'shout outs' on social media so your friends and family hear about the amazing project you are supporting. We hope it will get them talking about the plastic and waste issue which is never a bad thing.
Lots of cool zero waste themed hardware, some branded by us and some not. Either way they will be great to kick start you on your journey.
Finally those helping out a little more will have the opportunity to sponsor our food bins along with other advertising perks in our shop and our website.



""Why should we support a project like this?""
We dream of beautiful clean oceans, stunning sandy beaches, sea creatures swimming freely in their habitat without fear of injury or death.
That can become a reality but we have to change now, and we all have to work together towards this one goal.
We need to accept responsibility for our part in this tragic situation and wake up to the possibilities that are there to reverse what we have done.
I know we can do it if we all make small changes to our habits and behaviours. We may not be around to see the results but our children and grandchildren will benefit from the foundations we lay today.

<div>Hello. My name is Heather. I am a teacher, mother and friend to my community. I recently quit my full time teaching job to make my dream a reality. I have been working with children for over 25 years now. Growing up I was encouraged to play outside, climb trees, throw stones in water, paint, sing, laugh, roll down grassy hills and explore the world around me. My mother taught me how to plant food and flowers out of necessity and for recreation. We hunted for dragons, honey combs and berries, fished, hiked, collected things to put in my nature journal, dipped candles, played homemade instruments, painted and generally had a really good time trying to figure out how things worked.</div>
<div>My mom is gone now; however the things she taught me are being passed on to the children and families I share my life with. </div>
<div>There is no better place to build a sense of respect for the environment than by learning outdoors. Outdoor exploration offers a myriad of opportunities to learn science, build teamwork, practice social skills, exercise imagination, and simply to have fun!</div>
<div>I  guide groups of children along with their families on weekly adventures to explore nature. We track animals, pick berries and apples, study the stars and planets, explore tide pools, climb trees, observe insects and wildlife, jump in puddles, build snow forts, sing songs, play instruments, and engage in the world around us with those we love. No two days are ever alike. Rain, snow, wind and sunshine all add to the exploration opportunities we share each week.</div>
<div>Technology lends itself well to keeping us steadily connected and immersed in an almost endless amount of information. In and of itself, technology is not the enemy, but it has allowed children and families to lose touch with nature more easily than ever. We aim to provide an experience to moderate our children's balance of exposure to technology and media with a healthy dose of exposure to the outdoors and all the wonder that nature has to offer.</div>
<div>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/>
</div>
</div><div> <p>To make this project a success I need your help. I am looking for funding to help absorb some of the costs associated with initial operating expenses like registering and insuring the business as well as purchasing fine art materials for the groups. I teach painting and pottery with my students in addition to taking them on nature hikes and engaging in outdoor activities. Supplies we use regularly include watercolor paper, bees wax and wicks for candle making, brushes, and paints. We also use clay as well as a kiln. These things all add up in cost quickly. </p>
<p>My goal is to raise $850.00 to help meet these expenses. </p>
<p>I would be very grateful to meet this goal.</p>
<p>A lot of hard work has gotten me this far. I have literally scrubbed toilets, collected recycling, mended and laundered clothing, tutored students, offered nature mandala workshops, baby sat and sold fairy kisses (a mix of essential oil and water to calm a child's room) and homemade toys to help make this dream a reality.</p>
<p>My dream is that this seed will become a sapling and some day become a strong tree and drop more seeds.</p>
<p>At this time, our groups meet in a broad range of outdoor locations year round. Every season is magical in its own way and we love winter, spring, summer and fall in New England. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If my Million Dollar Challenge funds I would be able to secure the BIG dream. </span><br/></p>
<p>We would have enough funds to be able to set up a permanent location where families could engage in Nature based activities, fine and gross motor activities, study the stars, create artwork and engage in music. Children would enhance their language skills, learn to garden, prepare farm to table snacks and meals and share this experience with others. </p>
<p>Meeting this challenge would mean    we could also make this programming accessible to city children by purchasing a vehicle that would bring our tools on the road to children. Think ""Book Mobile"" only our tools of the trade are magnifying glasses, crickets, caterpillars, mud, seedlings, microscopes, plants and flowers, mobile raised bed gardens and telescopes to create more inquisitive minds. </p>
<p>The permanent location would be available free of charge to anyone who wanted to share their talents whether it be yoga, music, gardening, computer science or any other skill. </p>
<p>We would have a lending library/observatory/location to house camping and fishing equipment for the community to borrow free of charge and we would put a large portion into scholarships for teachers studying Environmental Education and anyone who needs help with continuing education costs. </p>
<p>We would have a home base to offer CPR and  First Aid training to anyone who wants it even if they feel they can't afford it. There is no reason why this should not be available to everyone!</p>
<p>Our calendars and special edition prints are a great visual reminder of the good you are doing for the next generation.</p>
<p>If the big dream comes true or we get close to it, we will be able to help teachers and parents guide the next generation of children into a mindset that promotes doing good simply for good's sake. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The impact is priceless. Allowing children to engage in activities that promote a sense of respect for the environment, physical activity, healthy eating habits, empathy and risk assessment will help shape them to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>We have an opportunity to instill values in our children and have them grow into a generation of people who think before they act and evaluate the impact they have on the earth.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe one of these kids might be a Nobel prize winner or contributor to the Smithsonian Institute simply because we went on a hike and turned over a log unveiling a whole ecosystem that caused the child to question the world.</p>
<p>Stranger things have happened!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There really is no risk here. If we have a small amount of funding, we start small. If we have a large amount of funding we help a larger group of people faster. No matter how much we have we will work toward the goals set before you. It just might take a little longer.</p>

No two days are ever alike. Rain, snow, wind and sunshine all add to the exploration opportunities we share each week.
Technology lends itself well to keeping us steadily connected and immersed in an almost endless amount of information. In and of itself, technology is not the enemy, but it has allowed children and families to lose touch with nature more easily than ever. We aim to provide an experience to moderate our children's balance of exposure to technology and media with a healthy dose of exposure to the outdoors and all the wonder that nature has to offer.

What We Need & What You Get

 To make this project a success I need your help. I am looking for funding to help absorb some of the costs associated with initial operating expenses like registering and insuring the business as well as purchasing fine art materials for the groups. I teach painting and pottery with my students in addition to taking them on nature hikes and engaging in outdoor activities. Supplies we use regularly include watercolor paper, bees wax and wicks for candle making, brushes, and paints. We also use clay as well as a kiln. These things all add up in cost quickly. 
My goal is to raise $850.00 to help meet these expenses. 
I would be very grateful to meet this goal.
A lot of hard work has gotten me this far. I have literally scrubbed toilets, collected recycling, mended and laundered clothing, tutored students, offered nature mandala workshops, baby sat and sold fairy kisses (a mix of essential oil and water to calm a child's room) and homemade toys to help make this dream a reality.
My dream is that this seed will become a sapling and some day become a strong tree and drop more seeds.
At this time, our groups meet in a broad range of outdoor locations year round. Every season is magical in its own way and we love winter, spring, summer and fall in New England. 
If my Million Dollar Challenge funds I would be able to secure the BIG dream. 
We would have enough funds to be able to set up a permanent location where families could engage in Nature based activities, fine and gross motor activities, study the stars, create artwork and engage in music. Children would enhance their language skills, learn to garden, prepare farm to table snacks and meals and share this experience with others. 
Meeting this challenge would mean    we could also make this programming accessible to city children by purchasing a vehicle that would bring our tools on the road to children. Think ""Book Mobile"" only our tools of the trade are magnifying glasses, crickets, caterpillars, mud, seedlings, microscopes, plants and flowers, mobile raised bed gardens and telescopes to create more inquisitive minds. 
The permanent location would be available free of charge to anyone who wanted to share their talents whether it be yoga, music, gardening, computer science or any other skill. 
We would have a lending library/observatory/location to house camping and fishing equipment for the community to borrow free of charge and we would put a large portion into scholarships for teachers studying Environmental Education and anyone who needs help with continuing education costs. 
We would have a home base to offer CPR and  First Aid training to anyone who wants it even if they feel they can't afford it. There is no reason why this should not be available to everyone!
Our calendars and special edition prints are a great visual reminder of the good you are doing for the next generation.
If the big dream comes true or we get close to it, we will be able to help teachers and parents guide the next generation of children into a mindset that promotes doing good simply for good's sake.    The Impact The impact is priceless. Allowing children to engage in activities that promote a sense of respect for the environment, physical activity, healthy eating habits, empathy and risk assessment will help shape them to make informed decisions.
We have an opportunity to instill values in our children and have them grow into a generation of people who think before they act and evaluate the impact they have on the earth.
Who knows, maybe one of these kids might be a Nobel prize winner or contributor to the Smithsonian Institute simply because we went on a hike and turned over a log unveiling a whole ecosystem that caused the child to question the world.
Stranger things have happened!   Risks & Challenges There really is no risk here. If we have a small amount of funding, we start small. If we have a large amount of funding we help a larger group of people faster. No matter how much we have we will work toward the goals set before you. It just might take a little longer.

Howdy co-creators! 
This year, in September 2015, we're organising a Permaculture Design Course (PDC) with Rosemary Morrow in Greece. For those of you who don't know what this is, a PDC is an intensive course to teach people how to design resilient and sustainable eco-systems.
My name is Tina Lymberis and for the last 5 years, I've tuned into my permaculture passion: I've been organising and teaching seminars, sustaining a blog about permaculture with educational articles in greek (www.kangouro.gr), starting transition initiatives and now I'm about to print Greece's first permaculture guide in Greek (earth user's guide to permaculture, Rosemary Morrow). 
The request is simple: raise enough cash to sponsor 15 Greek students to be able to attend this PDC and to give away 50 freshly translated permaculture books!

That's it! 
   What We Need & What You Get 
15 PDC spaces X €700 = €10,500
50 permaculture books X €40 = €2,000
Fees (paypal, fundraising platform, misc) = €2,500
TOTAL = €15,000Perks = feel good about supporting Greeks to reclaim and love their land! Know that giving = receiving. We simply do not have the luxury of adding perks, since this would add to the funds we would need and to the time to organise it all. However, unofficially, if you do decide to visit Greece, and have contributed over €100, the people you have supported, will be happy to host you on their project/land, since we are very hospitable generally!
If we don't reach our entire goal, whatever we do raise, will be spread amongst the participants to reduce their participation fee. If, on the other hand, we raise more, the funds will support  the video-recording and sub-titling of the PDC, so that the material will become accessible to more people!   
The Impact Now is the time for us to spread permaculture in Greece! With the current situation, more and more people are turning to the land and they simply do not know what to do with it! This course inspires solutions and a new way of seeing the world - to see that the solutions are inherent in the  so-called 'problems' or, as I like to call them, challenges. To see that collaboration is the only way forward, not only with each other, but with the earth!

In this series a team goes in and rescues animals. we wanted to fill similar shoes, Hence the name fauna police. we wanted it to be a  TV program initially, but our team started making short videos that are regularly featured on India News.</span></p><p style=""margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align: justify;""><span style='line-height: 107%;font-family: ""Times New Roman"",serif;font-size: 22pt;'>Established by Mr. Abhinav Srihan, a film maker by profession, India's first Animal rights officer in 2010 with two centers in Delhi, Dog's Inn (Noida) in sector 52. which can house 10 dogs at a given time. We provide first aid to animals and foster care. This adventurous journey began a few years ago when Abhinav started to rescue injured birds- birds that had fallen prey to kite flying and take them to shelters. we were surprised to see that most of shelters did not allow us to see the birds again.</span></p><p style=""margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align: justify;""><span style='line-height: 107%;font-family: ""Times New Roman"",serif;font-size: 22pt;'>We later came to know that most of the places do not have an infrastructure to treat and rehabilitate birds. This urged us to start a  roof top bird's Aviary, in Sarojini Nagar and this was the first step towards building Fauna Police. Here birds get large enclosure mimicking a natural environment for the containment of birds. They are kept in aviaries and then after 30 days of rehabilitation before the release. The birds which mature in the aviary learn basic skills like flying and pecking. Socializing skills amongst other birds can be developed in an aviary. Nature of cases treated and nursed regularly at Fauna police include Maanjha (glass) thread cut, avian pox, orphaned new born Etc.</span></p><p style=""margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align: justify;""><span style='line-height: 107%;font-family: ""Times New Roman"",serif;font-size: 22pt;'>Fauna police has now developed into an organization that works towards eradicating illegal Wild bird and Animal trade, helps to save animals from various emergencies; Whether man made or natural. This group helps to fight against animal cruelty and shutting down puppy mills. We are radically different from other animal care centers because we not only treat rescued  species physically but emotionally too.</span></p><p style=""margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align: justify;""><span style='line-height: 107%;font-family: ""Times New Roman"",serif;font-size: 22pt;'><br/></span></p><p style=""margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align: justify;""><span style='line-height: 107%;font-family: ""Times New Roman"",serif;font-size: 22pt;'></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458855257/rrnfva3kiw2yppw2j67r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Tantrics or Shamans use owls for black magic between months of October and November. Their blood, bones, claws, skull and organs are used and they are sacrificed during Diwali to bless a family.Birds are smuggled and fraudulently legitimized by saying that they are captive bred in India, which technically makes them aviary bred exotic birds. with captive bred birds the sellers can not  afford to let them die because the bird can command 3000 to 3500 dollars each. While a wild bird lays eggs only once in a year,the traders force it by injecting chemicals and hormones, which speeds up its reproductive cycle, says Koyama the Avian expert. This disturbs the life span and disrupts it's hormonal cycle. This is wrong on many counts:</span></p><p style=""margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;text-align: justify;""><span style='line-height: 107%;font-family: ""Times New Roman"",serif;font-size: 22pt;'></span><span style='line-height: 107%;font-family: ""Times New Roman"",serif;font-size: 22pt;'>Once a bird, especially young ones have been in captivity for a certain duration which varies with species, they are very difficult to release into the wild and will definitely die a sad death, by starvation or preyed upon by scavengers and predators.

Many Organizations call us to handle crisis, provide expertise on birds and wild life. We are on the mission to save Fauna and we are Fauna police.                       Our Inspiration: we really got inspired by the program called Animal Police on Discovery Channel. In this series a team goes in and rescues animals. we wanted to fill similar shoes, Hence the name fauna police. we wanted it to be a  TV program initially, but our team started making short videos that are regularly featured on India News.Established by Mr. Abhinav Srihan, a film maker by profession, India's first Animal rights officer in 2010 with two centers in Delhi, Dog's Inn (Noida) in sector 52. which can house 10 dogs at a given time. We provide first aid to animals and foster care. This adventurous journey began a few years ago when Abhinav started to rescue injured birds- birds that had fallen prey to kite flying and take them to shelters. we were surprised to see that most of shelters did not allow us to see the birds again.We later came to know that most of the places do not have an infrastructure to treat and rehabilitate birds. This urged us to start a  roof top bird's Aviary, in Sarojini Nagar and this was the first step towards building Fauna Police. Here birds get large enclosure mimicking a natural environment for the containment of birds. They are kept in aviaries and then after 30 days of rehabilitation before the release. The birds which mature in the aviary learn basic skills like flying and pecking. Socializing skills amongst other birds can be developed in an aviary. Nature of cases treated and nursed regularly at Fauna police include Maanjha (glass) thread cut, avian pox, orphaned new born Etc.Fauna police has now developed into an organization that works towards eradicating illegal Wild bird and Animal trade, helps to save animals from various emergencies; Whether man made or natural. This group helps to fight against animal cruelty and shutting down puppy mills. We are radically different from other animal care centers because we not only treat rescued  species physically but emotionally too.
                
Once abundant across large parts of India, the species like Parakeets, Mynas, Owls,Sparrows etc have slipped into the danger of extinction . A large part of this trade is meant for the International market and has no direct demand in India. Snatched from  the wild, Stolen from nests and left to die while smuggling, a staggering number of exotic birds that are sold in the local market are illegally brought in by heartless traders.This is a humble request to birds and animal lovers, say No to ""Bird Trade"". This is the first attempt to end cruelty and torture against birds.You can contribute in many ways to help us with the outreach of ""Uncage the Feather"". This is partly because the general public is completely ignorant about the laws, henceforth continue to encourage these nefarious activities by purchasing these innocent birds from these cruel traders.  A staggering number of birds are cruelly smuggled into India, lakhs per year, over porous borders and in appalling conditions.
 Parakeet: to catch wild parrots, the hunters take two of them as bait and puncture their eyes.These blind and wounded birds are left on a sheet, where they cry out for help. As soon as other concerned Parrots get attracted & descend towards the injured Parrots , the hunters throw a sheet on them hence capturing them. The hunters also use natural gums to trap them.OWLS: ""Despite the ban they are available for sale across the Country"", says Nikunj Sharma Government Affairs Liaison Head for PETA. Tantrics or Shamans use owls for black magic between months of October and November. Their blood, bones, claws, skull and organs are used and they are sacrificed during Diwali to bless a family.Birds are smuggled and fraudulently legitimized by saying that they are captive bred in India, which technically makes them aviary bred exotic birds. with captive bred birds the sellers can not  afford to let them die because the bird can command 3000 to 3500 dollars each. While a wild bird lays eggs only once in a year,the traders force it by injecting chemicals and hormones, which speeds up its reproductive cycle, says Koyama the Avian expert. This disturbs the life span and disrupts it's hormonal cycle. This is wrong on many counts:Once a bird, especially young ones have been in captivity for a certain duration which varies with species, they are very difficult to release into the wild and will definitely die a sad death, by starvation or preyed upon by scavengers and predators. Please DO NOT RELEASE THE BIRDS INTO THE WILD.However, the good news is that all this can stop, only if we make the choice. It is totally up to us to stop this nefarious and ecologically damaging activities. If we just stop buying birds as pets, captive breeding and the cruelty would stop too.Indian wild life species are banned for selling, purchasing or keeping.  There is a heavy penalty of up to INR 25,000 and or up to 3 years of imprisonment.                                                                         Our vision is to eliminate wild life trafficking from the root and,  build a free flight Aviary  for rescued birds where a large enclosure would not confine birds, unlike cages aviary allows the birds to fly freely in larger living space.Another mission is to buy an ambulance for  rescue operations of bird and animals who have been deprived of freedom and gone through tremendous amount of inhuman treatments. The expense in building up an 3,000 Sqft Aviary would cost around $60,000 which, is only possible when there are kind hearted contributors like you.
   

Sonpur (Chidiya Bazaar,North India)_-With the support of authorities like PFA and Animal welfare board, fauna police raided this market to put end to wild life trade.
Kanpur (North India) - with the support of Kamana Pandey we achieved great success in rescuing thousands of birds.
Gorakhpur and Lucknow (North India)
Hyderabad(Mehboob Chawk,South India)Where many markets were exposed and raided amongst 300 illegal wild life trade markets in India. We are yet to uncover many more markets like these. Help us uncage them and lets give a beautiful and caring, free flight aviary

     
Contribute in building a free flight aviary for birds
In summers, keep water for birds outside your homes.
Adopt dogs/cats but NO BIRDS (if you cannot  afford an aviary)

<p>In April 2015, the company submitted an Italian patent application for the new biocomposite derived from industrial hemp waste, followed by an international application in April 2016.

<p><b>Hemp  - A 5000-year history</b></p>
<p>About 5000 years ago, wild hemp spread throughout Eastern Asia and was later introduced into India. This extraordinary plant was used in religious ceremonies, as an aid to meditation and for medicinal purposes as well as a source of fiber, oil and food. From the 5th century BC, hemp began to be cultivated in Europe, namely in Norway, Sweden, Germany and in the Celtic regions of the United Kingdom. Around 100 BC, hemp was also used for paper production. The plant was introduced into the Middle East by the nomadic tribes of central Asia.</p>
<div>Historical records on hemp use trace back thousands of years. The Greek historian Herodotus (484 - 425 BC) described its use in funeral rituals; in ancient Rome, Discorides - physician, pharmacologist and botanist during Nero's reign - mentioned its medical uses in several papers (90 AD) and Pliny the Elder (23 - 79 AD) reported that hemp was used to make sails and ropes. </div>
<p>In the 1500s, the cultivation of hemp began in South America, followed by North America a century later.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Until the 1950s, hemp was used as raw material in various sectors, with Italy being one of the most important producing countries in the world, first for quality and second only to the Soviet Union for cultivated acres.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Starting in the 1930s - 1950s, hemp cultivation began to rapidly decline for political reasons and due to pressure from the competing cotton, paper and petrochemical industries.</span></p>

About us:





From scratch to finished product


After an initial stage of studies and experiments, the first ideas started to take shape and eventually led to the development of a new and innovative product.
In April 2015, the company submitted an Italian patent application for the new biocomposite derived from industrial hemp waste, followed by an international application in April 2016. The HBP® finish resembles that of wood and has proved to be more efficient than other bioplastics on the market.

With this album we want to help them discover the opportunities that birding tourism brings. The youngsters won’t carry guns, but photo cameras, binoculars and the dream of a better country.     One action, many benefitsBy supporting us, you will receive one of our great rewards and in turn, we will be able to print the collection and distribute half of the print run (with no cost to them) to youngsters living in bird rich regions throughout Colombia. This will be achieved through our program “Cultura de aves, cultura de paz” (Bird culture, culture of peace), which strengthens learning processes in young people interested in birds by bringing them books and equipment, and by providing workshops with birding tourism experts aimed at creating the next generation of birdwatching guides. The collection is the focal point of this capacity building program.The resources obtained from the other half of the print run in Colombia, and bird-related events in Europe and the United States, will be donated to 25 organizations that promote education, conservation, and the development of birding tourism in different parts of the country.With the support of these organizations, nature tourism operators, and international artists, we have created a set of irresistible reward packages for those who support our campaign. They include tours and birdwatching expeditions to unexplored regions where you will find unique birds with your expert birding guide. We also have nine fantastic and exclusive works of art in LEGO created for this campaign by the British artist Thomas Poulsom. The rewards are completed by a beautiful and unique paper sculpture of the Archaeopteryx, produced by Colombian Artist Diana Beltrán Herrera. If birds win, we all winThe resources gained from this campaign will be used to cover the design and printing costs of the first print run of the collection (11.000 albums + 5.000.000 stickers). This year we will focus on bringing the collection, free of charge, to young people who live in remote and biodiversity rich areas, so that they can learn about their birds while having fun contemplating the collection. The rest of the copies will be sold in cities in order to generate the funds that will allow us to keep working and supporting the 25 organizations that are part of this project.Besides visiting places filled with birds endemic to Colombia or having the great pieces of art we offer as rewards in your home, you will also receive a complete collection (album in English or Spanish + 400 stickers).All funds gathered with this campaign will be invested in finishing and printing the collection. If we don’t manage to reach our goal to print the eleven thousand collections (album + stickers), we will print the number possible (depending on the funds collected) and sell them at stores, shopping malls, fairs, and bird-related events. We are also looking for support from the Colombian government in order to keep implementing our program Cultura de aves, cultura de paz, in different regions of Colombian.We will publish videos every two weeks showing the processes we support, beautiful stories of the youngsters and Colombian birds, as well as testimonies from the collection’s users.Everything for the birdsBy helping us print this educational editorial product, you will also be giving us the first big push to develop our program Cultura de aves, cultura de paz. With this, we will shape leaders in conservation, and future birding guides who will help develop their own regions through their work. The program includes a digital communication strategy that will result in apps for the study of birds, knowledge contests in television, and invites to bird fairs in Colombia and other countries. This whole strategy will get underway when we take the collection to young people from different parts of the country and when we begin selling the collection to bird-watchers from all over the world. We want every birder who visits Colombia to have the collection!Dedication to overcome challengesWe decided to dedicate our lives to the conservation of birds and to help our country become a world power in birding tourism.The biggest challenge we face is the collection’s distribution. It will only be truly successful once the eleven thousand printed copies reach the hands of birding tourists, youngsters, families, etc… enabling us to start creating a new identity and image for Colombia through its birds and allowing us to overcome the grief and suffering of our tragic past.To accomplish this we need to do a good job distributing the collection. This is why we have formed an alliance with official institutions, nature tourism companies, ornithological associations, hotels and international bird festivals, which will help us promote and distribute the collection in Colombia and other countries.Sharing makes the world a better placeHelp us reach more people. If you know someone who likes birds, and travelling to see them, tell them about our campaign. We also need help reaching out to donors interested in supporting the continued development of our program Cultura de aves, cultura de paz.You can also take advantage of the tools provided by Indiegogo to easily share. You will find these on the right hand side of the campaign’s main image.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>About us</b></p>
<p><i>EcoVillage Uganda</i> is a recognized community based organization which
aims to achieve most sustainable development and eco-friendly practices in the
rural areas of Masaka in Uganda. Founded in 2010 [registration number C.D
7063], we focus on promoting an energy-conscious society through creating
effective networks amongst students, educators, business and community leaders.
Our momentarily efforts focus on energy- and forest-saving projects. This
campaign however, is getting set up by our two german interns which are
currently in masaka.</p>
<p><b>Goal: Providing an
eco-friendly, inexpensive Energy Source for Schools</b></p>
<p>The goal of our campaign is
to raise enough money to establish at least five Biogas-Plants, preferably for
schools around Masaka. We already identified three schools which would be very
glad to receive a Biogas-Plant and posses the animals to make use of it. You
can see the amazing kids who would benefit from this eco-friendly, inexpensive
energy source on the added pictures!</p>
<p><b>Why Biogas-Plants?</b></p>
<p>Since forests are cut down
to provide fuel-wood and soil for agriculture, Uganda loses about 6.000
hectares of forests every 30 days. If no action is registered by 2050, Uganda’s
per capita forest cover will be zero (NEMA, 2009). Already 28 districts have
lost their entire forest ecosystem while another 19 districts have forest cover
lower than 1% (source: WWF). </p>
<p>In development countries
all over the world, locally installed, small-scale Biogas-Systems have proven
themselves as a cost efficient and effective solution to reduce the use of
conventional fuels, while utilizing resources which are already in hand! They
use bacteria to break down wet, organic waste like sewage, dung or food-remains
and transform it through fermentation into a usable mixture of gases and a
semi-solid residue. Through a piping-system, the Biogas is taken to the kitchen
where it is used with a Biogas-Stove. It is estimated that only a single rural
family can save up to three tones of wood annually, utilizing this technology
(source: ARTI). So a whole school could save lots of forest by using Biogas!</p>
<p><i>Additional Benefits</i></p>
<ul>
<li> Saving costs for firewood/kerosene/charcoal</li>
<li> Decreased greenhouse gas emissions</li>
<li> Providing a healthy cooking-environment
     through smoke-free combustion</li>
<li> Connected toilet greatly improves
     hygiene and doesn't need to be emptied</li>
<li> Remaining bio-slurry is an excellent
     manure/ feeding supplement for animals</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Costs</b></p>
<p>The whole Biogas-System is
going to cost about 850 $ each. To maximize the benefits it is necessary to
have a connected toilet. The calculation therefore includes a 6m<sup>3</sup>
plant (mainly consisting of a combined slurry- and gas container made of
concrete and buried underground), toilets with sections for boys and girls plus
the necessary first filling of the chamber with fresh cow-dung as well as
PVC-Piping, valves and a biogas-stove for the schoolkitchen.</p>
<p><b>Our additional Efforts</b></p>
<p>Additionally to our campaign on Indiegogo we started a fundraising
project called “Buy a Mile Campaign” targeting big companies which have
branches in Masaka. For that, we will gather a multinational crowd of
volunteers, mobilized through the AIESEC exchange program and locals, which
will go on an EcoBike-Ride with several EcoCamps in towns and
communities. It will be launched 6<sup>th</sup> of June 2016 and, depending on
the sponsor´s feedback, will go on up until the 9<sup>th</sup>. During our
EcoCamps we are giving trainings on eco-friendly behavior in schools, meeting
majors to promote environmental consciousness, sell food and play music to get
in contact with the communities. In this context we offer national and
international companies and institutions the possibility to buy the miles we ride, showcasing
their advertisements. After these campaigns succesfully raised the
necessary funds, we are going to install the plants together with the involved
volunteers to cut the costs for workers.</p>
<p>We are convinced that
through the combination of Indiegogo- and company-fundraising we are going to
mobilise enough funds to achieve our goal: To install an environmentally
friendly, sustainable and healthy energy source.</p>

</ul>
<div>
We are a team of 15 people, with diverse backgrounds and one common
interest: <b>inclusive recycling</b>. We are committed to ReciVeci and the waste pickers with whom we have
developed a unique bond, and we will invest all our energies to make this project
a banging success.<br/>

</div><div>
<p>ReciVeci
emerges from civil society, making it an innovative and transparent project of
great importance for our country.</p>

<b>Why do we do this?</b><br/>
</div><div>
<p>There is a need to improve recycling at the source in
Quito-Ecuador, as only 25% of potentially recyclable material is processed, the
remaining materials ends up in landfills and dumps.</p>
<p>CURRENTLY, waste
picking works like this:</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453762016/u19iw7au1yuwq3kl6lac.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">The recycler loses with this process because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The work day is grueling: more than 8 hours of daily continuous material
sourcing (night and early mornings)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p style=""display: inline !important;"">They
walk long distances</p></span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">They experience mental strain (many are mothers who never stop thinking
about their kids who are left alone at home or in care of a family member)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">They are exposed to sanitary risks</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
Recycling has a <b>women’s</b> name.
More than 70% of waste pickers in Ecuador are women, who maintain their families
with the income earned from recycling.<br/>
</div>
</div><div>
Being part of an informal sector that is socially and economically
excluded, they don’t have access to social security, loans and regular benefits
available for an ordinary citizen.<br/>
</div><div>
Remember: what is not recycled ends up in the environment, causing
negative impacts to our resources and our health. An orderly process of waste
segregation at the source would result in significant urban savings and would immensely
improve the recycler’s <b>quality of life</b>.<br/>
</div><div>
<b>With the ReciVeci App, waste recycling would look
like this:</b><br/>
</div><div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453762256/u7nwip6piyht4dnz0kqv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">A win-win process for the environment and the recycler
as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The recycler captures more material, generating higher economic
resources</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The quality of life of families is significantly enhanced,</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">A bond is generated between neighbors and recyclers</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The quality of the service provided by the informal recyclers is made
visible to the public and the planet</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The recyclers will have a waste collection center with adequate infrastructure
to protect them, and the materials, from sun and rain</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
Recycling IS NOT “the person who picks the garbage at night”. This stigmatizes
recycling and the people that recycle. ReciVeci promotes a professional service that is not currently acknowledged;
it is anonymous, invisible and feminine.<br/>
</div><div>
<b>How does ReciVeci work?</b><br/>
</div><div>
ReciVeci is working in a pilot neighborhood in Quito, where neighbors
(the “vecis”) will be the project’s protagonists, as results are expected at a
neighborhood level. Our dream is that ReciVeci will become a replicable model
for other neighborhoods in the city and nationwide.<br/>
</div><div>
<p>You can become a ReciVeci in only 3 easy steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Support, share and stay informed by giving like to our Facebook page,
following us on twitter and sharing our messages. Use Indiegogo’s tools to

</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Separate your waste.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Identify your neighborhood’s recycler, gather your recyclables
in a bag and give them to him/her.</span><br/>
</li>
</ol>
</div><div><b>
<b>What have we done so far?</b><br/></b></div><div>
During the last 6 months we have generated a working community with
waste pickers in a pilot neighborhood in Quito, with the objective of learning
about their reality and implementing actions to generate change at a local
level.<br/>
</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453762508/vyii39jgnjpc4fcyfydg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Some of these actions include the development of a mobile app, web site
and social networks to promote the creation of a bond between neighbors and
their neighborhood recycler and sharing advice for the correct segregation of
waste at home.<br/>

Only 38% of households nationwide segregated their waste in 2014, this

<p><b>VERSIÓN EN ESPAÑOL (English version above) </b></p>
<p><b>¿Quiénes somos y qué buscamos?</b></p>
<p>ReciVeci es una iniciativa de voluntariado ciudadano, innovadora y transparente, que promueve el reciclaje inclusivo en Ecuador.  Somos un grupo de vecinos de Quito que nos organizamos para <b>generar una Cultura de Reciclaje por medio de un vínculo humano entre recicladores y ciudadanos.</b></p>
<p>Trabajamos en:</p>
<p>· Separar residuos en los hogares ecuatorianos.</p>
<p>·  Aumentar eficiencia y fortalecer la organización de los recicladores de base.</p>
<p>· Capacitar a los vecinos y vincularlos al reciclador local.</p>
<p>· Generar herramientas tecnológicas.</p>
<p>Somos 15 profesionales con un interés común: el <b>reciclaje inclusivo</b>. Estamos comprometidos con ReciVeci y las recicladoras con quienes hemos creado un vínculo especial. </p>
<p>ReciVeci tiene gran importancia en el país al surgir desde la sociedad civil, lo que lo hace innovador y transparente.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453500316/ebdhrkjpaw7vvxrh55yv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>¿Por qué hacemos esto?</b></p>
<p>En Quito - Ecuador, se requiere reforzar y fortalecer el reciclaje en la fuente ya que actualmente tan sólo se recicla el 25% del material potencialmente reciclable y el resto termina en botaderos a cielo abierto y rellenos sanitarios.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453500486/bplqo5mjcfyugz1nihii.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>En este proceso PIERDE el reciclador, pues:</p>
<p>x   Las jornadas de trabajo son agotadoras: más de 8 horas diarias continuas de recolección (noche y madrugada),</p>
<p>x   Recorren, en suma, grandes distancias,</p>
<p>x   Tienen alto desgaste mental (muchas son madres que nunca dejan de pensar en sus hijos que quedan solos en casa o en compañía de familiar).</p>
<p>x  Se exponen a riesgos sanitarios</p>
<p>El reciclaje tiene nombre de <b>mujer</b>. Más del 70% de los recicladores en Ecuador son mujeres que mantienen a sus familias con los ingresos del reciclaje.</p>
<p>Al ser un grupo informal, social y económicamente <b>excluido</b>, no pueden acceder al seguro social, créditos bancarios y en general a los beneficios de cualquier ciudadano.</p>
<p>Recuerda que: lo que no se recicla termina en el ambiente, ocasionando impactos negativos a nuestros recursos y nuestra salud a largo plazo.

ENGLISH VERSION (Versión en ESPAÑOL abajo): 

Who
are we? What do we work for?
Reciveci is a citizen volunteership initiative that promotes inclusive
recycling in Ecuador. We are a group of neighbors in Quito that work together
to build
a recycling culture by creating a human bond between the waste picker and the
citizen.

We work in :


Increasing the percentage of recycable material segregation in
Ecuadorian homes.


Improving
the recycling efficiency of waste pickers.


Educating neighbours and linking them directly to their neighbourhood waste pickers.


Generating
tools to strengthen citizen education through: workshops, mobile apps, social
networks; and

Strengthening the social organization of waste pickers and boosting
their entrepreneurship potential.


We are a team of 15 people, with diverse backgrounds and one common
interest: inclusive recycling. We are committed to ReciVeci and the waste pickers with whom we have
developed a unique bond, and we will invest all our energies to make this project
a banging success.


ReciVeci
emerges from civil society, making it an innovative and transparent project of
great importance for our country.


Why do we do this?

There is a need to improve recycling at the source in
Quito-Ecuador, as only 25% of potentially recyclable material is processed, the
remaining materials ends up in landfills and dumps.
CURRENTLY, waste
picking works like this:

The recycler loses with this process because:


The work day is grueling: more than 8 hours of daily continuous material
sourcing (night and early mornings)


They
walk long distances


They experience mental strain (many are mothers who never stop thinking
about their kids who are left alone at home or in care of a family member)


They are exposed to sanitary risks



Recycling has a women’s name.
More than 70% of waste pickers in Ecuador are women, who maintain their families
with the income earned from recycling.


Being part of an informal sector that is socially and economically
excluded, they don’t have access to social security, loans and regular benefits
available for an ordinary citizen.

Remember: what is not recycled ends up in the environment, causing
negative impacts to our resources and our health. An orderly process of waste
segregation at the source would result in significant urban savings and would immensely
improve the recycler’s quality of life.

With the ReciVeci App, waste recycling would look
like this:


A win-win process for the environment and the recycler
as:


The recycler captures more material, generating higher economic
resources


The quality of life of families is significantly enhanced,


A bond is generated between neighbors and recyclers


The quality of the service provided by the informal recyclers is made
visible to the public and the planet


The recyclers will have a waste collection center with adequate infrastructure
to protect them, and the materials, from sun and rain



Recycling IS NOT “the person who picks the garbage at night”. This stigmatizes
recycling and the people that recycle. ReciVeci promotes a professional service that is not currently acknowledged;
it is anonymous, invisible and feminine.

How does ReciVeci work?

ReciVeci is working in a pilot neighborhood in Quito, where neighbors
(the “vecis”) will be the project’s protagonists, as results are expected at a
neighborhood level. Our dream is that ReciVeci will become a replicable model
for other neighborhoods in the city and nationwide.

You can become a ReciVeci in only 3 easy steps:


Support, share and stay informed by giving like to our Facebook page,
following us on twitter and sharing our messages. Use Indiegogo’s tools to
promote our project.


Separate your waste.


Identify your neighborhood’s recycler, gather your recyclables
in a bag and give them to him/her.



What have we done so far?
During the last 6 months we have generated a working community with
waste pickers in a pilot neighborhood in Quito, with the objective of learning
about their reality and implementing actions to generate change at a local
level.



Some of these actions include the development of a mobile app, web site
and social networks to promote the creation of a bond between neighbors and
their neighborhood recycler and sharing advice for the correct segregation of
waste at home.


Only 38% of households nationwide segregated their waste in 2014, this
shows we have lots of work to do!

We have supported the neighbourhood’s waste pickers in
creating their formal organization, boosting their access to social and labor
benefits in Ecuador. The association is called Asociación SONREIR (Smile
Association) and is composed by 10 individuals. 

ReciVeci will be using your donation for:


Our goal is to collect $15,000 to improve the working conditions of the
recyclers in our pilot neighbourhood. The money gathered will be invested in:


Door to door training of residents in our pilot area about waste segretation at home and its delivery to their neighborhood recycler.


Renovation of a 60 m2 lot in the Association’s waste collection
center to improve waste handling conditions, protecting recyclers and the
material, from sun and rain.


Buying work equipment, such as scales, so that the recyclers and
ReciVeci can generate statistics and indicators of the impact of the door-to-door
collection service, which will be visualized in our mobile app.


Purchasing of complete work apparel for the recyclers including: aprons,
gloves, rain ponchos, tricycles for waste collection, identification tags, big
bags, etc.


The implementation of a mobile app, web site and social network
management to strengthen the bond between recycler and citizen, all of which
will also work as education channels for environmental training.


Launch of the ReciVeci project with a target
audience of 3,000 people/day. The recyclers will welcome the neighbours that
attend the event bringing their recyclables, host a meet and greet, sparking
interactions to gather information on how to improve their service.





You now know our story and the reasons why we need your SUPPORT. Your
contribution will lead the way to ensure ReciVeci will revolutionize inclusive
recycling and change the livelihoods of thousands of families, all whilst
protecting the environment.

Become a Reciveci, this project
is yours!



VERSIÓN EN ESPAÑOL (English version above) 
¿Quiénes somos y qué buscamos?
ReciVeci es una iniciativa de voluntariado ciudadano, innovadora y transparente, que promueve el reciclaje inclusivo en Ecuador.  Somos un grupo de vecinos de Quito que nos organizamos para generar una Cultura de Reciclaje por medio de un vínculo humano entre recicladores y ciudadanos.
Trabajamos en:
· Separar residuos en los hogares ecuatorianos.
·  Aumentar eficiencia y fortalecer la organización de los recicladores de base.
· Capacitar a los vecinos y vincularlos al reciclador local.
· Generar herramientas tecnológicas.
Somos 15 profesionales con un interés común: el reciclaje inclusivo. Estamos comprometidos con ReciVeci y las recicladoras con quienes hemos creado un vínculo especial. 
ReciVeci tiene gran importancia en el país al surgir desde la sociedad civil, lo que lo hace innovador y transparente.

¿Por qué hacemos esto?
En Quito - Ecuador, se requiere reforzar y fortalecer el reciclaje en la fuente ya que actualmente tan sólo se recicla el 25% del material potencialmente reciclable y el resto termina en botaderos a cielo abierto y rellenos sanitarios.

En este proceso PIERDE el reciclador, pues:
x   Las jornadas de trabajo son agotadoras: más de 8 horas diarias continuas de recolección (noche y madrugada),
x   Recorren, en suma, grandes distancias,
x   Tienen alto desgaste mental (muchas son madres que nunca dejan de pensar en sus hijos que quedan solos en casa o en compañía de familiar).
x  Se exponen a riesgos sanitarios
El reciclaje tiene nombre de mujer. Más del 70% de los recicladores en Ecuador son mujeres que mantienen a sus familias con los ingresos del reciclaje.
Al ser un grupo informal, social y económicamente excluido, no pueden acceder al seguro social, créditos bancarios y en general a los beneficios de cualquier ciudadano.
Recuerda que: lo que no se recicla termina en el ambiente, ocasionando impactos negativos a nuestros recursos y nuestra salud a largo plazo. Un proceso de separación ordenado desde su fuente implicaría un ahorro urbano importante y aumentaría la calidad de vida de los/las recicladores/as.
Con la APLICACIÓN de ReciVeci el proceso de reciclaje de base será así:

En este proceso, GANA el reciclador y el ambiente, pues:
 ·  Los recicladores captan más material generando recursos económicos dignos
·  Se mejora la calidad de vida de estas familias,
·  Se crea el vínculo entre los vecin@s y l@s reciclador@s
·  Se visibiliza la calidad del servicio que brindan a la ciudadanía y al planeta
·  Cuentan con un centro de acopio con infraestructura adecuada para protegerse de sol y lluvia
El reciclaje NO ES “la persona que recoge la basura por la noche”. Esto estigmatiza el reciclaje y a la persona que recicla. ReciVeci promueve un servicio que hoy en día es profesional pero no se lo reconoce, es anónimo, es invisible y es femenino. 
¿Cómo funciona ReciVeci?

3. Identifica al reciclador/a de tu barrio, arma tu funda y entrégale tus residuos reciclables.
¿Qué hemos hecho hasta el momento?
