<h2>About Eden - Eden - Universe &amp; Survival Rules</h2>
<h3>(<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.taban-miniatures.com/shop2/includes/languages/french/images/icon.gif"" src="""" style=""""/> Version Française de cette page <strong><a href=""http://www.taban-miniatures.com/rulebook/Universe-Rules.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Eden Univers et Règles de Survie"">ici</a></strong>)</h3>
<p>For 3 years now, the post apocalyptic skirmishes game ""Eden"" has been played by hundreds of enthusiasts gamers.</p>
<p>From the feedbacks we have got since the beginning, we can proudly say that this tactical, fast and easy gaming system is one of the best skirmishes game around...</p>
<p>However one problem remained :  so far we hadn't found the time to gather and formalize the background elements.</p>
<p>We still needed to lay on paper the history of the world that stand beyond the design of this game universe and characters</p>
<p>This problem is almost solved !</p>
<p>The creator of the Eden universe, lead art director and initiator of the project, Mohamed Ait Mehdi, (A.K.A. Mohand on the international miniature gaming scene ) has a great news for those longing to know what is behind this apocalyptic world !</p>
<p>With the help of many talented writers and graphic artists, Mohand brought to life a 150 pages book. You will find inside 100 pages of background and  an augmented version of the rules.</p>
<p>You will learn the history of this devastated world, the horrors that led to the apocalypse and how the factions played in the game emerged from the ashes of the civilisation</p>
<p>Beside, the rule section of the book will include :</p>
<ul>
<li>clearer writing of the core rule system</li>
<li>new sceneries management rules</li>
<li>and a brand new exciting feature : the multi player mode that will allow you to fight against up to 3 other opponents !</li>
</ul>

<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.taban-miniatures.com/rulebook/CBT.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/><span class=""Style1"">Why do we need your help ?</span>
</h3>
<p>Basically to cover the printing (for both English and French versions) and translation costs of the initial batch of books.</p>
<p>- The original english version of the rules will get an new professional translation and rewriting -</p>
<p>But many artists have worked on this project, and will also be rewarded by your funding.</p>
<p>Beyond the initial funding needs, we will also be able to release exclusive gaming material to allow the contributors to get the best of this project.</p>

About Eden - Eden - Universe & Survival Rules
( Version Française de cette page ici)
For 3 years now, the post apocalyptic skirmishes game ""Eden"" has been played by hundreds of enthusiasts gamers.
From the feedbacks we have got since the beginning, we can proudly say that this tactical, fast and easy gaming system is one of the best skirmishes game around...
However one problem remained :  so far we hadn't found the time to gather and formalize the background elements.
We still needed to lay on paper the history of the world that stand beyond the design of this game universe and characters
This problem is almost solved !
The creator of the Eden universe, lead art director and initiator of the project, Mohamed Ait Mehdi, (A.K.A. Mohand on the international miniature gaming scene ) has a great news for those longing to know what is behind this apocalyptic world !
With the help of many talented writers and graphic artists, Mohand brought to life a 150 pages book. You will find inside 100 pages of background and  an augmented version of the rules.
You will learn the history of this devastated world, the horrors that led to the apocalypse and how the factions played in the game emerged from the ashes of the civilisation
Beside, the rule section of the book will include :

clearer writing of the core rule system
new sceneries management rules
and a brand new exciting feature : the multi player mode that will allow you to fight against up to 3 other opponents !



Why do we need your help ?

Basically to cover the printing (for both English and French versions) and translation costs of the initial batch of books.
- The original english version of the rules will get an new professional translation and rewriting -

STORY</b><br/></b></p><p></p>
<p>I
am an artist and a scholar. I am well known as the designer of eleven
Tarot decks and three oracle decks, including <i>The Alchemical
Tarot.</i> <i>The Tarot of the Sevenfold
Mystery, </i>and <i>the Burning Serpent oracle</i>.  (You can see these
decks by viewing my previous Indiegogo campaigns.)  I am also a respected scholar on the subjects
of divination, mysticism, and the occult. My book, <i>The Tarot: History, Symbolism, and Divination</i>, was recommended as
one of the best books ever written on the subject, by the American Library
Association, in a review in their periodical, “Booklist.” </p>
<p>In
the 1980s, I had a series of visionary experiences that opened my eyes to the
connections between alchemy and the Tarot and led me to designing <i>The Alchemical Tarot</i>.  Since then, <i>The Alchemical Tarot</i> has become world famous, (the first edition
has been resold for the highest price paid for a modern deck.) I have been
invited to cut the ribbon at the grand opening of the Tarot Museum in Riola,
Italy, I have curated an exhibition on the history of Tarot at the Craft and
Folk Art Museum in LA, I lecture on the history of cards regularly at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York, and one of my decks is included in
their collection.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445980556/qcsrfk5plvfg2izensw0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Although
at this time most people would associate The Tarot deck with divination and
playing card decks with card games, this was not always the case. My research
has led me to the realization that all card decks, including the Tarot and
four-suit decks, have always been used for both games and divination.  In fact, historically, most diviners were more
likely to use a four-suit deck for divination.</span><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></div><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In
the late 18</span><sup style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">th</sup><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> century, this trend led to the creation of a plethora
of decks that were designed primarily for divination. These decks were called
sibilla or oracle decks.  The most
popular variation was the 36-card Lenormand deck, named after the most famous
diviner of the Napoleonic period, and first published in Germany in 1847.</span><br/>

<p>Each
card in an oracle deck depicted an iconic symbolic image and included a small
image of the playing card that was meant to relate to the image. Their
popularity continued up until the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century when the
re-envisioned occult Tarot deck began to take their place. It was the study of
these oracle decks in the Metropolitan Museum collection that led me to a new
appreciation of the rich history behind the images on regular playing cards. </p>
<p>For
those of you who would like to delve deeper into the history of oracle cards, I
recommend my article, The History of Oracle Cards, on my website:</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href=""https://wordpress.com/post/80843251/592/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A History of Oracle Cards in Relation to The Burning Serpent Oracle and a New Revelation About the Origin of the Lenormand</a>.)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>MY
INSPIRATION </b></p>
<p>I
wanted to design a deck of cards that honored these connections, that could be
used for both games and divination, and that was designed with an appreciation
for the graphic beauty and simplicity of common playing cards. So I have turned
the tradition on its head.  I have
designed an innovative deck of cards that has oracle symbols added to the
cards, a deck that honors both purposes. </p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This
is not my first oracle project.  My first,
was a deck that I designed with input from the noted Tarot author Rachel
Pollack. It was called </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Burning
Serpent Oracle</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.  I designed this deck and Rachel wrote the accompanying
book.  With </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Hermes Playing Card Oracle</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> I am including a small book that
fits in the card box and explains the basics of divination with the deck.  However, if you desire to delve more deeply
into the mysteries of divination with the oracle, I recommend reading Rachel’s
book.  It comes with the deck that I
designed, and I am offering the set together with </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Hermes Playing Card Oracle</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> as one of the perks.  </span><br/></p>

<p>PRODUCTION
</p>

2016. The minimum goal for this campaign is meant to cover the printing cost,
but I will print it whether I reach the goal or not. I guarantee that I will
mail out all perks no matter how much this campaign earns.  I am planning on mailing them in February. It
is only once the goal is reached, and we go over that amount, that I will begin

<p><b>A DESCRIPTION OF THE DECK FROM THE LITTLE WHITE BOOK</b> </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>The Hermes Playing
Card Oracle</i> is the latest oracle deck designed by Robert M. Place.  It is a standard game deck of 52 cards plus
two jokers, but with the addition of symbolic images on each card, each
providing a divinatory meaning. It can be used for card games, or laid out in
the traditional pattern, known as the Grand Tableau, and used for divination. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445959205/xsjmq9oz84ieznqc0xwl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Although the Tarot is the deck that most people today would
associate with divination, historically, regular four-suit decks of playing
cards were more likely to have been used for this purpose. In the late 18</span><sup style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">th</sup><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
century, oracle decks were first published in which each card was illustrated
with a symbol designed primarily for divination, but a small image of the
playing card associated with each symbol was also included on each card. The
most popular oracle deck was the Petit Lenormand, first published in Germany in
1847. This deck was based on the common 36-card German deck (a deck without the
2 through 5 pip cards in each suit) and a miniature playing card was included at
the top of each card. There were, however, many variations of oracle decks
produced in the 19</span><sup style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">th</sup><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> century, including some based on the standard
52-card French deck.</span><br/></p>
<p><i>The Hermes Playing
Card Oracle</i> is like a traditional oracle deck, but instead of each card
being dominated by a symbolic image, with only a miniature of the associated
playing card inserted somewhere on the card, each card is a standard playing
card with the symbolic image inserted somewhere on the card. The symbolic
images on each card are ones found in traditional oracle decks, and each has a
specific meaning.  The ones on the ace,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and the three royal cards in each suit are the same as in the
Lenormand oracle.  If the number 2, 3, 4,
and 5 pips of each suit are removed, the deck can function as a standard
Lenormand oracle deck.  </p>
<p>The deck can be used for any card game, but when it is used
for divination, all of the cards are to be shuffled and laid out in the Grand
Tableau pattern.  When the deck is being
used as a standard Lenormand, the Grand Tableau will consist of four rows of
eight cards, laid out left to right from the top to the bottom row. Then the
remaining four cards are to be laid out in a fifth row, centered on the bottom.
 When all 54 of the cards in the deck are
used, which includes the two Jokers, the Grand Tableau with consist of six rows
of nine cards, laid out left to right top row to bottom.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445959331/gzxvtnmgq8k8gpksj8gc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The most important cards in the reading are the
significators. These are the Ace of Spades, representing the subject of the
reading if she is a woman, and the Ace of Hearts, representing the subject if
he is a man. If the subject is a woman then the Ace of Hearts may represent her
love interest, and likewise the Ace of Spades may serve this function for a
man. This relationship is strongest when the male and female cards seem to be
facing each other. If the subject is a lesbian woman, the Female Joker may
serve as the love interest. Likewise, the Male Joker may serve this function
for a gay man.  Although traditionally romantic
relationships are a major focus for oracle readings, the cards may be used to
divine on any subject, and the second significator and the Jokers may be used
to represent others, such as friends or relatives.</span><br/></p>
<p>When reading the spread, first locate the significator and
determine which way she or he is facing. The cards in a horizontal or diagonal
line extending from the front of the significator (that she or he is facing)
represent the future.  The cards
extending horizontally or diagonally behind the significator represent the
past.  The cards in a vertical line
directly above and below the significator represent the present.  Cards below the significator represent issues
that have been mastered by the significator and ones above still present a
challenge. The cards closest to the significator are the strongest in the their
influence and the ones further away are the weakest or most distant in time.  </p>
<p>Also pay attention to images that are facing the significator
and therefore moving toward her or him, also ones that are facing away and
moving away. Direction is especially important when considering the King of
Clubs, with the Cloud on his card. Pay attention to the cloud that appears at
the top of the card.  It has a dark negative
side and a light positive side. The dark side will weaken or obscure the card
next to it.  </p>
<p>There are also layouts with fewer cards, and the cards can
be used in any layout recommended for Lenormand cards. To learn more, any good
book on Lenormand cards will be helpful, such as <i>The Burning Serpent Oracle</i> by Rachel Pollack. </p>

</div></div>","The Hermes Playing Card Oracle is a standard deck of cards that measures 3.5"" by 2.5"", with 54 cards, including two jokers, on slightly thicker paper. But a divinatory symbol is included on each card.  It is both a collector's deck of playing cards and a divinatory tool. MY
STORY
I
am an artist and a scholar. I am well known as the designer of eleven
Tarot decks and three oracle decks, including The Alchemical
Tarot. The Tarot of the Sevenfold
Mystery, and the Burning Serpent oracle.  (You can see these
decks by viewing my previous Indiegogo campaigns.)  I am also a respected scholar on the subjects
of divination, mysticism, and the occult. My book, The Tarot: History, Symbolism, and Divination, was recommended as
one of the best books ever written on the subject, by the American Library
Association, in a review in their periodical, “Booklist.” 
In
the 1980s, I had a series of visionary experiences that opened my eyes to the
connections between alchemy and the Tarot and led me to designing The Alchemical Tarot.  Since then, The Alchemical Tarot has become world famous, (the first edition
has been resold for the highest price paid for a modern deck.) I have been
invited to cut the ribbon at the grand opening of the Tarot Museum in Riola,
Italy, I have curated an exhibition on the history of Tarot at the Craft and
Folk Art Museum in LA, I lecture on the history of cards regularly at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York, and one of my decks is included in
their collection.
Although
at this time most people would associate The Tarot deck with divination and
playing card decks with card games, this was not always the case. My research
has led me to the realization that all card decks, including the Tarot and
four-suit decks, have always been used for both games and divination.  In fact, historically, most diviners were more
likely to use a four-suit deck for divination.
In
the late 18th century, this trend led to the creation of a plethora
of decks that were designed primarily for divination. These decks were called
sibilla or oracle decks.  The most
popular variation was the 36-card Lenormand deck, named after the most famous
diviner of the Napoleonic period, and first published in Germany in 1847.



Each
card in an oracle deck depicted an iconic symbolic image and included a small
image of the playing card that was meant to relate to the image. Their
popularity continued up until the mid 20th century when the
re-envisioned occult Tarot deck began to take their place. It was the study of
these oracle decks in the Metropolitan Museum collection that led me to a new
appreciation of the rich history behind the images on regular playing cards. 
For
those of you who would like to delve deeper into the history of oracle cards, I
recommend my article, The History of Oracle Cards, on my website:

A History of Oracle Cards in Relation to The Burning Serpent Oracle and a New Revelation About the Origin of the Lenormand.)

MY
INSPIRATION 
I
wanted to design a deck of cards that honored these connections, that could be
used for both games and divination, and that was designed with an appreciation
for the graphic beauty and simplicity of common playing cards. So I have turned
the tradition on its head.  I have
designed an innovative deck of cards that has oracle symbols added to the
cards, a deck that honors both purposes. 







This
is not my first oracle project.  My first,
was a deck that I designed with input from the noted Tarot author Rachel
Pollack. It was called The Burning
Serpent Oracle.  I designed this deck and Rachel wrote the accompanying
book.  With The Hermes Playing Card Oracle I am including a small book that
fits in the card box and explains the basics of divination with the deck.  However, if you desire to delve more deeply
into the mysteries of divination with the oracle, I recommend reading Rachel’s
book.  It comes with the deck that I
designed, and I am offering the set together with The Hermes Playing Card Oracle as one of the perks.  



PRODUCTION

The Hermes Playing Card Oracle is now in production at the printers.  It is scheduled to be here by February first,
2016. The minimum goal for this campaign is meant to cover the printing cost,
but I will print it whether I reach the goal or not. I guarantee that I will
mail out all perks no matter how much this campaign earns.  I am planning on mailing them in February. It
is only once the goal is reached, and we go over that amount, that I will begin
to earn a profit for my work. $5,000 is only meant to me the minimum goal. So please feel free to order perks even after the goal is reached.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE DECK FROM THE LITTLE WHITE BOOK 


The Hermes Playing
Card Oracle is the latest oracle deck designed by Robert M. Place.  It is a standard game deck of 52 cards plus
two jokers, but with the addition of symbolic images on each card, each
providing a divinatory meaning. It can be used for card games, or laid out in
the traditional pattern, known as the Grand Tableau, and used for divination. 




Although the Tarot is the deck that most people today would
associate with divination, historically, regular four-suit decks of playing
cards were more likely to have been used for this purpose. In the late 18th
century, oracle decks were first published in which each card was illustrated
with a symbol designed primarily for divination, but a small image of the
playing card associated with each symbol was also included on each card. The
most popular oracle deck was the Petit Lenormand, first published in Germany in
1847. This deck was based on the common 36-card German deck (a deck without the
2 through 5 pip cards in each suit) and a miniature playing card was included at
the top of each card. There were, however, many variations of oracle decks
produced in the 19th century, including some based on the standard
52-card French deck.
The Hermes Playing
Card Oracle is like a traditional oracle deck, but instead of each card
being dominated by a symbolic image, with only a miniature of the associated
playing card inserted somewhere on the card, each card is a standard playing
card with the symbolic image inserted somewhere on the card. The symbolic
images on each card are ones found in traditional oracle decks, and each has a
specific meaning.  The ones on the ace,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and the three royal cards in each suit are the same as in the
Lenormand oracle.  If the number 2, 3, 4,
and 5 pips of each suit are removed, the deck can function as a standard
Lenormand oracle deck.  
The deck can be used for any card game, but when it is used
for divination, all of the cards are to be shuffled and laid out in the Grand
Tableau pattern.  When the deck is being
used as a standard Lenormand, the Grand Tableau will consist of four rows of
eight cards, laid out left to right from the top to the bottom row. Then the
remaining four cards are to be laid out in a fifth row, centered on the bottom.
 When all 54 of the cards in the deck are
used, which includes the two Jokers, the Grand Tableau with consist of six rows
of nine cards, laid out left to right top row to bottom.  




The most important cards in the reading are the
significators. These are the Ace of Spades, representing the subject of the
reading if she is a woman, and the Ace of Hearts, representing the subject if
he is a man. If the subject is a woman then the Ace of Hearts may represent her
love interest, and likewise the Ace of Spades may serve this function for a
man. This relationship is strongest when the male and female cards seem to be
facing each other. If the subject is a lesbian woman, the Female Joker may
serve as the love interest. Likewise, the Male Joker may serve this function
for a gay man.  Although traditionally romantic
relationships are a major focus for oracle readings, the cards may be used to
divine on any subject, and the second significator and the Jokers may be used
to represent others, such as friends or relatives.
When reading the spread, first locate the significator and
determine which way she or he is facing. The cards in a horizontal or diagonal
line extending from the front of the significator (that she or he is facing)
represent the future.  The cards
extending horizontally or diagonally behind the significator represent the
past.  The cards in a vertical line
directly above and below the significator represent the present.  Cards below the significator represent issues
that have been mastered by the significator and ones above still present a
challenge. The cards closest to the significator are the strongest in the their
influence and the ones further away are the weakest or most distant in time.  
Also pay attention to images that are facing the significator
and therefore moving toward her or him, also ones that are facing away and
moving away. Direction is especially important when considering the King of
Clubs, with the Cloud on his card. Pay attention to the cloud that appears at
the top of the card.  It has a dark negative
side and a light positive side. The dark side will weaken or obscure the card
next to it.  
There are also layouts with fewer cards, and the cards can
be used in any layout recommended for Lenormand cards. To learn more, any good
book on Lenormand cards will be helpful, such as The Burning Serpent Oracle by Rachel Pollack.

put players through <b>real life financial challenges</b> as they <b>compete</b> with their
friends and worldwide opponents to be the <b>wealthiest and most
popular</b> player. <br/><br/></p>
<h3>Freedom Quest's Purpose/Mission?</h3>
<p>According to Alan Greenspan, the former
Chairman of the Federal Reserve, ""<b>the number one problem in today's
generation and economy is the lack of financial literacy</b>"". Whether you 
are a fan of Greenspan or not, you cannot deny the veracity of that 
statement. Should you doubt his words, you need not look further than 
our debt load, our pitiful savings, our
love affair with consumerism, and the costly financial mistakes we as a 
society
make over and over again. Despite its importance, <b>the unfortunate truth 
is that
financial literacy is not being taught in homes or in schools</b>.<b> As a 
result,
people go through life clueless and only learn the hard way; from making
 their
own mistakes.... some of them more costly than others</b>...<br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/445312/files/20140319111354-Begin_Saving.jpg?1395252834"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p><br/>Our solution is Freedom Quest: <b>players will experience real 
life situations and have to make decisions based on real life
variables</b>. <b>They will then have to live with the consequences of their 
actions and see the full ramifications of unsound decisions.</b> <b>The 
learning is gradual, so there is no need for prior experience/knowledge</b>;
 we will teach players everything they need to know through the game, 
and the difficulty level will increase as they progress.<br/><br/><b>So going
 back to the purpose of Freedom Quest? To provide a safe learning 
environment so that mistakes can be made in the game and not in real 
life!</b> After playing our game, players will be significantly more 
knowledgeable on financial matters, which should translate to better 
financial decisions in the real world. <br/><br/></p>
<h3>How And What Will Players Learn?</h3><p>Throughout
the game, players will be able to get financial tips and advice from the 
game's many mentors and characters. They will learn about assets and 
liabilities, income and expenses, saving and
investing, debt and credit score, taxes and collections. The gameplay will extend into investment, passive income,  retirement and such once the player is ""ready"", based on their in-game performance . Everything is progressive.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/486167/files/20140405130301-learnables2.png?1396728181"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In 
addition, <b>players will constantly have to make real life trade offs such 
as focusing on Net-worth or financial status, eating healthy vs buying 
fast food, buying a new car vs a used one, cash vs debt</b>....etc, the 
lessons are endless! By being exposed to it all, players will learn the 
value of sound financial decisions, and more importantly, <b>they will have
 the knowledge to know what constitute a sound financial decision!</b><br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/445321/files/20140319111443-Introduce_Credit.jpg?1395252883"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>As players progress through the game and compete against their 
friends, <b>they will be exposed to buying a house, purchasing a car, 
starting a business...etc, complete with real life choices such as size

Freedom Quest is a free-to-play game designed to
put players through real life financial challenges as they compete with their
friends and worldwide opponents to be the wealthiest and most
popular player. 
Freedom Quest's Purpose/Mission?
According to Alan Greenspan, the former
Chairman of the Federal Reserve, ""the number one problem in today's
generation and economy is the lack of financial literacy"". Whether you 
are a fan of Greenspan or not, you cannot deny the veracity of that 
statement. Should you doubt his words, you need not look further than 
our debt load, our pitiful savings, our
love affair with consumerism, and the costly financial mistakes we as a 
society
make over and over again. Despite its importance, the unfortunate truth 
is that
financial literacy is not being taught in homes or in schools. As a 
result,
people go through life clueless and only learn the hard way; from making
 their
own mistakes.... some of them more costly than others...

Our solution is Freedom Quest: players will experience real 
life situations and have to make decisions based on real life
variables. They will then have to live with the consequences of their 
actions and see the full ramifications of unsound decisions. The 
learning is gradual, so there is no need for prior experience/knowledge;
 we will teach players everything they need to know through the game, 
and the difficulty level will increase as they progress.So going
 back to the purpose of Freedom Quest? To provide a safe learning 
environment so that mistakes can be made in the game and not in real 
life! After playing our game, players will be significantly more 
knowledgeable on financial matters, which should translate to better 
financial decisions in the real world. 
How And What Will Players Learn?Throughout
the game, players will be able to get financial tips and advice from the 
game's many mentors and characters. They will learn about assets and 
liabilities, income and expenses, saving and
investing, debt and credit score, taxes and collections. The gameplay will extend into investment, passive income,  retirement and such once the player is ""ready"", based on their in-game performance . Everything is progressive.In 
addition, players will constantly have to make real life trade offs such 
as focusing on Net-worth or financial status, eating healthy vs buying 
fast food, buying a new car vs a used one, cash vs debt....etc, the 
lessons are endless! By being exposed to it all, players will learn the 
value of sound financial decisions, and more importantly, they will have
 the knowledge to know what constitute a sound financial decision!As players progress through the game and compete against their 
friends, they will be exposed to buying a house, purchasing a car, 
starting a business...etc, complete with real life choices such as size 
of down payment, amortization, interest rate, fixed or variable, open or
 closed...etc (introduced gradually and in a fun way). With changing 
circumstances and economic cycles, the players will quickly find out if 
they made the right choice.
We are aware that every country and
province/state has different tax brackets, interest rates, retirement saving
plans...etc. For the purpose of the game, we use averages and generalities to
convey the message. The numbers in the player’s specific geographical region
might be slightly higher or lower, but they won't differ too much, and the
lessons will still be applicable.

We understand that finance can be boring topic, so as much as 
we want to create an educational game, we are determined to make it an 
engaging, fun, social, interactive, and competitive experience.

you ever installed the latest game on your PC only for the graphic card to burn
out just as you get into the groove? If you experienced this, you’d realize
that your current cooling system for your machine isn’t really working and most
of the other solutions out there are costly, high maintenance or just can’t
fulfill its duties. The team at Tech Armory feels that this is just unacceptable
in this day and age. We believe that <b>everyone</b> should be able to enjoy
the games they play without any worries or distractions. And that’s when we
created, The Gladius.</p>
<p>The
Gladius is a Desktop PC with a revolutionary submersion cooling system. It is
designed to be the perfect gaming machine, packing enough power to run any game
at maximum settings, while providing complete protection against burn out.</p>

Servicing And Upgrading</p>
<p><font color=""#8A0808"" size=""3""><b>Passive Submersion Cooling
– No Fans, No Leakage</b></font><br/></p><p>Our passive submersion
technology works by submerging PC parts into mineral oil, a non-conductive
coolant that dissipates heat. The mineral oil not only provides an excellent
medium for heat dissipation but also has an added benefit of preserving the
parts submerged inside. Furthermore, zero fans or any active cooling devices
are used for cooling. 
</p><p>But, that’s not all. </p>
<p>We solved the leaking problem
that comes with submersion cooling.</p>
<p>All
past attempts at submersion cooling have failed immensely due to a persistent
leakage problem, better known as the Capillary Effect. It occurs when the
cables draw up the mineral oil and cause it to travel along them, resulting in
the mineral oil leaking out of the other end, for example, your mouse or
keyboard. <br/><i>(For a simple demonstration of
this, dip one end of a piece of tissue in water and watch the liquid rise up
and spread to the rest of it. SCIENCE FTW!)</i></p>
<p>Our
team has worked very long and hard on this problem and we are happy to announce
that we have managed to overcome the Capillary Effect in the Gladius.</p>
<p><font color=""#8A0808"" size=""3""><b>Dual Case Design – Featuring The Anima </b><b>System</b></font><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/302484/files/20140111055816-Side-black2.jpg?1389448696"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The most distinguishing feature of a Tech Armory PC is our dual
case design. It is a re-imagining of PC design, built around the idea of having
two casings instead of just one. The first case is the Anima system, the red, internal
heart of the Gladius, that houses the important heat generating components of
the computer such as the CPU, graphics card and mother board. It is air tight,
sound proof and filled with mineral oil. The Anima System makes passive
submersion cooling possible with the use of high conductivity materials,
convection currents and the mineral oil as a medium to cool the components
during use. 

</p><p>The exterior case is the sleek, smooth shell that encapsulates the
Anima System. It helps to funnel all heat generated away from you through the fins, keeping you
cool and focused even in the most intense gaming experience. <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/302528/files/20140111063238-FinFocus.jpg?1389450758"" src="""" style=""width: 569px; height: 321px;""/></p><p>It also gives you
convenient access to your I/O ports and hard disks with its magnetic snap-ons
and removable back panel. </p>
We plan to offer a variety of snap-on casings to allow users
greater customizability in the future. 

<p><font color=""#8A0808"" size=""3""><b>Freedom From Maintenance And Degradation</b></font><br/></p><p>All
computers require some measure of upkeep to ensure that they continue to
operate at peak performance. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/309695/files/20140115034413-dustcooler.jpg?1389786253"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Air Cooled PCs become choked with dust and hairs
over time and need to be cleaned once every 3 months (as shown above). Water Cooled PCs have a
chance of leakage and the pipes need to be changed every 6 months due to mold
or sediments.
<p></p><p>We
overcame these issues by submerging the PC components in a mineral oil that is slow to degrade, does not evaporate and is completely anaerobic (does not contain Oxygen). This prevents the formation of rust, dust and mold. Furthermore, without any moving parts like pumps or fans, our cooling system cannot fail due to wear and tear.</p>
<p><font color=""#8A0808"" size=""3""><b>The Cooling Never Stops</b></font><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/302563/files/20140111065453-anima2.jpg?1389452093"" src="""" style=""""/>The problem with most cooling solutions out there is the fact that once a computer is shut down, they stop working. However, the heat remains trapped and the resulting buildup can cause damage to your components.

</p><p>Our
Anima system, on the other hand, provides ‘always on’ heat dissipation which
passively cools the computer even when the machine has been switched off,
giving the protection and cooling that it needs the most.</p>
<p><font color=""#8A0808"" size=""3""><b>No Additional
Power For Cooling</b></font><br/></p><p>By using passive cooling in the Gladius, no additional
power is required for cooling. This means very significant savings every year
on power which is good news for all of us who like to game long hours through
the day and night. <br/></p>
<p><font color=""#8A0808"" size=""3""><b>Silent Operation</b></font></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/302566/files/20140111070033-3quarts-black2.jpg?1389452433"" src="""" style=""""/>Have you ever
been distracted by the loud whirring of your computer fans as they try desperately
to cool your PC? With the way we built The Gladius, noise is now a thing of the
past. It runs so silently (under 15db) that you can hear a pin drop.


</p><p><font color=""#8A0808"" size=""3""><b>Graphic Card Cooling</b></font><br/></p><p>Most liquid cooled computers only cover the CPU,
ignoring the graphics card. However,the
graphics card is usually the part most taxed by heavy gaming use. Our design
takes this into account and ensures that the graphics card receives the cooling
it needs.</p>
<p><font color=""#8A0808"" size=""3""><b>Easy Servicing And Upgrading</b></font><br/></p><p>With the dual case design, our plans for servicing and upgrading are
very simple. Tech
Armory will swap damaged/new components with a fresh set on the spot. This
avoids situations where users lose their PC for several days while repairs or
upgrades are done.
</p>
<hr/><p><font color=""#8A0808"" size=""5""><b>How Well Do We Compare To Other Cooling Methods?</b></font></p>
We put the Gladius through exhaustive tests to ensure that it gives maximum cooling performance in any situations.

<hr/><p><font color=""#8A0808"" size=""5""><b>FAQ</b></font></p>
<p><b>Won't
submerging components in a liquid damage the PC?</b><br/>
The mineral oil we use is non-conductive so the possibility of an internal
short circuit is practically zero.</p>
<p><b>Is
there any chance of the mineral oil leaking out?</b><br/>
Similar cooling technologies on other computer systems have this as a major
complaint. Some of the D.I.Y. solutions out there leak all over the table or
other surfaces that the computer touches. Our systems are built to be
completely air-tight and will not leak at all.</p>
<p><b>How
safe is the coolant?</b><br/>The coolant we use is
non-toxic and is even FDA approved so any accidental ingestion is safe. (It
does have a laxative effect though)

</p><p><b>What
is the idle temperature of your system?</b><br/>
Multiple tests have shown that the temperature of the PC will rise slowly and
steadily for about a period of 2 hours before finally hitting a stable
temperature of +15°C above ambient temperature. </p>
<p><b>What if I decide to add on stuff after the campaign is over?</b><br/>Don’t worry, we’ll be confirming your orders again before we ship and we
will allow you to add on funds for your additional stuff.

</p><p><b>Won’t the components be outdated by the time you start shipping?</b><br/>We know for sure that parts get outdated quickly in the PC industry. The
current specifications are a placeholder for now. We will overhaul the specs
before we start shipping to the latest parts at no cost to our backers, so rest
assure that you will be getting a beast of a machine,

</p><p><b>What will be the retail price of the Gladius?</b><br/>The retail price of a Gladius would be about $3488.

</p><p><b>Is there a DIY Kit</b><b> and can I just buy the case?</b><br/>We do not have a DIY Kit although we realise that there is a demand for it in the PC market.
We do not sell just the case because of our experience in testing components from the different brands for submersion. <br/></p><p>Unfortunately, as PC Component Manufacturers design their products differently,
there is a chance that their methods would react negatively to the liquid. Some brands use a non-standard capacitor on their circuit board that actually starts leaking its electrically conductive contents when exposed to prolonged submersion. This leads to a conductive environment in the oil that will destroy all parts submerged within.<br/><br/>As a result, we only offer parts that have been tested in our system, which will be covered under two years warranty.<br/></p><p><b>Can I change the components
in the Anima system on my own?</b><br/>Tech Armory advises against this as we use specialized techniques and
machinery to ensure that the Anima system is watertight. Customers who wish to
change their components by themselves do so at their own risk, as we cannot
guarantee that you will be able to seal it back properly. 

</p><p><b>How much is Shipping?</b><br/>Unfortunately, shipping for the Gladius can be costly for a machine of
its size and weight. We will strive to source for a cheaper way of getting them
out but for now, please bear with us.

</p><p>Shipping costs will be confirmed and billed to you when we are ready for

avid gamers ourselves, all of us at Tech Armory are familiar with the loss of
our PCs to burn out issues, caused either by pushing them too hard or the lack
of maintenance. We created the Gladius to be a gaming machine that could run
any game, at highest settings, without the need to be maintained or fear of
over-heating. We achieved this by using high heat conductivity materials in
combination with submersion technology, to provide a compounded cooling effect
40 times greater than that of air cooling in PCs.  
We've
been hard at work for over 2 years, and with the community's help, we're ready
to take the Gladius into full-fledged production. So join us and help us make
the eradication of burnout a reality for all gamers. Be the first to own a
Gladius today!And, if you need further discussions on The Gladius, visit The Gladius forum thread at crowdfundingforum.com to ask your questions.

Featured in: Digital Life Newspaper - Well-Oiled Gaming Machine The
Gladius - A Gaming PC with the Ultimate Solution
to OverheatingHave
you ever installed the latest game on your PC only for the graphic card to burn
out just as you get into the groove? If you experienced this, you’d realize
that your current cooling system for your machine isn’t really working and most
of the other solutions out there are costly, high maintenance or just can’t
fulfill its duties. The team at Tech Armory feels that this is just unacceptable
in this day and age. We believe that everyone should be able to enjoy
the games they play without any worries or distractions. And that’s when we
created, The Gladius.
The
Gladius is a Desktop PC with a revolutionary submersion cooling system. It is
designed to be the perfect gaming machine, packing enough power to run any game
at maximum settings, while providing complete protection against burn out.
Key
FeaturesThe Gladius has the following features:

1)  Passive Submersion Cooling
2)  Dual Case Design 
3)  Freedom From Maintenance And Degradation
4)  The
Cooling Never Stops
5)  No Additional Power For Cooling
6)  Silent Operation
7)  Graphics Card Cooling
8)  Easy
Servicing And Upgrading
Passive Submersion Cooling
– No Fans, No LeakageOur passive submersion
technology works by submerging PC parts into mineral oil, a non-conductive
coolant that dissipates heat. The mineral oil not only provides an excellent
medium for heat dissipation but also has an added benefit of preserving the
parts submerged inside. Furthermore, zero fans or any active cooling devices
are used for cooling. 
But, that’s not all. 
We solved the leaking problem
that comes with submersion cooling.
All
past attempts at submersion cooling have failed immensely due to a persistent
leakage problem, better known as the Capillary Effect. It occurs when the
cables draw up the mineral oil and cause it to travel along them, resulting in
the mineral oil leaking out of the other end, for example, your mouse or
keyboard. (For a simple demonstration of
this, dip one end of a piece of tissue in water and watch the liquid rise up
and spread to the rest of it. SCIENCE FTW!)
Our
team has worked very long and hard on this problem and we are happy to announce
that we have managed to overcome the Capillary Effect in the Gladius.
Dual Case Design – Featuring The Anima System
The most distinguishing feature of a Tech Armory PC is our dual
case design. It is a re-imagining of PC design, built around the idea of having
two casings instead of just one. The first case is the Anima system, the red, internal
heart of the Gladius, that houses the important heat generating components of
the computer such as the CPU, graphics card and mother board. It is air tight,
sound proof and filled with mineral oil. The Anima System makes passive
submersion cooling possible with the use of high conductivity materials,
convection currents and the mineral oil as a medium to cool the components
during use. 

The exterior case is the sleek, smooth shell that encapsulates the
Anima System. It helps to funnel all heat generated away from you through the fins, keeping you
cool and focused even in the most intense gaming experience. It also gives you
convenient access to your I/O ports and hard disks with its magnetic snap-ons
and removable back panel. 
We plan to offer a variety of snap-on casings to allow users
greater customizability in the future. 

Freedom From Maintenance And DegradationAll
computers require some measure of upkeep to ensure that they continue to
operate at peak performance. Air Cooled PCs become choked with dust and hairs
over time and need to be cleaned once every 3 months (as shown above). Water Cooled PCs have a
chance of leakage and the pipes need to be changed every 6 months due to mold
or sediments.
We
overcame these issues by submerging the PC components in a mineral oil that is slow to degrade, does not evaporate and is completely anaerobic (does not contain Oxygen). This prevents the formation of rust, dust and mold. Furthermore, without any moving parts like pumps or fans, our cooling system cannot fail due to wear and tear.
The Cooling Never StopsThe problem with most cooling solutions out there is the fact that once a computer is shut down, they stop working. However, the heat remains trapped and the resulting buildup can cause damage to your components.

Our
Anima system, on the other hand, provides ‘always on’ heat dissipation which
passively cools the computer even when the machine has been switched off,
giving the protection and cooling that it needs the most.
No Additional
Power For CoolingBy using passive cooling in the Gladius, no additional
power is required for cooling. This means very significant savings every year
on power which is good news for all of us who like to game long hours through
the day and night. 
Silent OperationHave you ever
been distracted by the loud whirring of your computer fans as they try desperately
to cool your PC? With the way we built The Gladius, noise is now a thing of the
past. It runs so silently (under 15db) that you can hear a pin drop.


Graphic Card CoolingMost liquid cooled computers only cover the CPU,
ignoring the graphics card. However,the
graphics card is usually the part most taxed by heavy gaming use. Our design
takes this into account and ensures that the graphics card receives the cooling
it needs.
Easy Servicing And UpgradingWith the dual case design, our plans for servicing and upgrading are
very simple. Tech
Armory will swap damaged/new components with a fresh set on the spot. This
avoids situations where users lose their PC for several days while repairs or
upgrades are done.

How Well Do We Compare To Other Cooling Methods?
We put the Gladius through exhaustive tests to ensure that it gives maximum cooling performance in any situations. Here is how the Gladius fared compared to other cooling methods:

*Readings were taken with ambient temperature
of 30⁰C. Due to different PC parts being used, the final product temperature readings will be different than those shown here.

Specification List
We know for sure that parts get outdated quickly in the PC industry so
the current specifications are a placeholder for now. We will overhaul the
specs before we start shipping to the latest parts at no cost to our backers, so rest assured that you will be getting a beast of a machine.

level it gets “self-directing” effect. And if in the beginning it
engages only one target in case of successful hit, then on its
maximum it always engages the target and fires the nearest enemies.Inventory   There
are 4 types of items in the Game that you can use: the ring, the
amulet, the bracelet and the staff. 

   Destroying
enemies the gamer can find the potion of life/mana which restores the
relevant characteristics, staves or a pouch mood. A ring, amulet or a
braceletcan
be found in the pouch. 
   There
will be more than 300 magic items. There
will also be different books for the strengthening of the hero.   In
addition there will also be an opportunity to destroy unnecessary
items and get Energy for them which can be exchanged for the
improvement of different characteristics of the hero.


Enemies
   Lots
of different enemies with unique characteristics can be found in the
game. Some
of them are very fast and furious. Some can damage you even after
death. Some are slow but extremely dangerous.

Risks


    We are very nervous because its our first attempt to launch such
a game. We hope to receive your feedback and loyalty. Since our
childhood we were dreaming to create games. And now we are in several
steps nearby our dream. To release our vision we need to hire more
professionals: designers, programmers, testers, we need high-end
equipment for testing and good expertise to build up a high quality
product. By our own hands we created 35% of the game and we are keen
to make the game of the future the game that we are dreaming about
since our childhood. We hope that we can roll out a full version of
the game in autumn with your help. Thats why we need your support. If

<p>Seven years ago we met HR Giger and his wife Carmen in person. We 
told him about the idea to implement ​​his museum in Gruyeres 1:1 
virtually. He was immediately enthusiastic and brought in his ideas: The
 museum should be moving, intelligent and comprehensive. At that point 
we had not expected, that <strong>Giger's Universe</strong> would be so 
extensive! Many more meetings followed, and HR Giger led us through his 
creepy museum and his private place. And guess what! Even his garden is 
so crazy that this already is worth a trip! HR Giger allowed us to film 
at all these places and we got insights into his working methods. He 
showed us artworks that had never been released before. We are proud to 
obtainded such an exclusive insight into Giger's life. It is very sad 
for us that HR Giger is no longer allowed to witness this moment. We are
 happy that his widow Carmen will be with us in this project.</p>

<b></b><p>In a complex procedure we bring the architecture and each single art- and designwork to life. First we use the latest <b>3D-laser-scanning technology</b> to capture all the details of the museum, the artworks and the house and garden. After that, the entire object is shot with texture photography. From these results we generate a virtual model of the entire scene in Gruyère, including the village square. </p>
<p>Then all <b>3D-objects are scanned in detail</b> in order to obtain a picture of the exact geometrie and make detailed 3D-models.

<p>Gravit is a 2D
platform game mixing adventure and puzzle. You will be confronted to the end of
the World.</p>
<p>The goal of this
video game is to regroup several originalities around a main idea : a
progressive change in gravity in a classic platform game.</p>
<p>But the word
""classic"" didn't delight us. So we added lots of complementary ideas
designed to help you facing the gravity cataclysm : dynamic fluids for water
and lava, grappling hook, sword of power, temporal vortex, anti-gravity boots...</p>
<p>The scenario has a
real significance in our game to articulate all the elements around a main
story.</p>
<p>As you probably
understood, Gravit’s base is to play with gravity. This last is changing all
along the game going through different steps. But not only does gravity affect
the player. The environment and objects are also subject to its action.</p>
<p>Never forget, gravity
can change any time!</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><b>Normal
gravity <br/></b>At the beginning of
the game, the character will be subject to a normal gravity. He can do little
jumps, leap from wall to wall, climb ropes and ladders, carry or throw light
objects. A fall from few meters or a hard impact will be deadly to the
character.</p>
<p><b>Light
gravity </b><br/>Then the cataclysm
starts, gravity is decreasing of a half. We could believe we are on the moon.
The character can double, even triple the length and height of his jumps. He
can fall from higher level without dying and carry objects twice the initial
weight. With this gravity, the character can reach inaccessible areas.
Being able to cross a ravine of several meters will provide the player with a
sense of power.</p>
<p><b>Zero
gravity </b><br/>Then comes the most
original part of the game, no gravity at all. Like in the space, the character
is floating in the air and can only turn on himself. But you can still move by
using the scenery elements. You can use bubbles of water floating in the space
to control your movements.</p>
<p><b>Reverse
gravity </b><br/>As it was not enough,
in this step, gravity loses its control. The character is now attracted by the
sky ! You need to use some elements of the scenery not to fall down in heaven.
Water and lava are flying away to the sky and trees are uprooting.</p>
<p><b>High
reverse gravity </b><br/>For the last part,
the character will be ejected to the sky. Gravity will be higher than the
initial one. Your weight will be doubled : little jumps, cannot carry
anything... Every action will be an ordeal.</p>
<p><b>Dynamic environments </b><br/>The scenery elements respond to physical laws.
The character can move objects and cross over unstable obstacles, but beware
of violent shocks and big falls that will be fatal.</p>
<p><b>Dynamic liquid<br/></b>In ""Gravit"", the liquid system that is
set up enables to create any kind of hydraulic challenge (Archimedes'
principle, dam, boat, mill, waterfall, ...) or simply reinforces the game
aesthetic by coupling the gravity changes with realistic liquids. In zero
gravity especially, the water will form big bubbles in which the player can
swim to move. The player immersion is complete! (you can say that again !)</p>
<p><b>Grappling hook <br/></b>The grappling hook is a rope the player can fix
anywhere. Thus, he/she can throw it from one branch to another and overcome
many obstacles.</p>
<p><b>The sword of power</b> <br/>It is a sword able to cut all that surrounds
it. You can build bridges with trees by playing lumberjacks, lock mechanism by
carefully cutting its gears, unlock passages blocked by rocks or cut a house in
half! Your power has no limits! But the sword is also useful to solve tests in
which the mechanism will be based on the objects weight: cutting an object in
half is like dividing its weight by two.</p>
<p><b>Temporal vortex</b> <br/>This mystical object will allow you to save the
world, but also help you to overcome many obstacles that you could not succeed
because of time: door closing too fast, mill running too fast, projectile too
fast to be avoided, …</p>
<p><b>Antigravity boots</b> <br/>Once equipped with these miraculous boots, you
can reverse the character gravity at any time .Walk once on the
ground, then once the ceiling. Some obstacles will force you to use the boots.</p>
<p><b>Mini games</b> <br/>Lots of mini games can be added to Gravit.
Especially thanks to the game physics engine.</p>
<p><b>Level editor</b> <br/>The level editor is a small program that will
enable you (well, mostly us!) to create levels without developing a single line
of code. Thus, you can shape the ground, add items (box, trees, branches, ropes
...), add water, change the gravity, etc. ....</p>
<p><b>Death</b> <br/>To integrate realism in the animation of death, we used
the well-known technique of ragdoll. Each body part of the character (arms,
legs, head) is converted into dynamic objects that independently interact with
its environment.</p>
<p><b>Music</b> <br/>Here are some music samples composed by Samuel PINTO
SOEIRO that we find promising:<span class=""notranlsate""></span><span class=""notranlsate""></span><span class=""notranlsate""></span><span class=""notranlsate""></span><span class=""notranlsate""></span></p>

<p>We want to create a whole world !
Not just a game !</p>
<p>When I look at Gravit prototype,
I think that only a coating is missing to make it a small masterpiece. But make
no mistake, a coating worthy of the name requires a lot of work!</p>
<p>For you to get an idea of what
remains to be done : trying to incorporate ideas of original gameplay in
an original scenery that will be in an original scenario with music and graphic
designs in accordance with the set to create an authentic world. Oh ! And
don’t forget that the player must be able to gradually get accustomed to the
game. In short, probably one of the hardest puzzle-game to solve :)</p>
<p>So, with only the two of us, we
find ourselves a little short to accomplish all the tasks incumbent on us. For
this reason, we decided to resort to a donation campaign. In order to fund the
coating worthy of our wildest dreams ! The game will be released whether we
obtain a cash infusion or not. But we do not like to botch the potential of a
game. This is why we appeal to you today.</p>

This game coating only depends on you !<p></p>

Here a pre-alpha demo of Gravit. enjoy and leave a comment!


A talented graphic designer, Jean-Baptiste Casasola, looked into Gravit.
 You can gaze at his first artistic research on the game.


We find that his artistic touch fit well with our project. Here is a link to his portfolio, where you will find numerous works that rock :)

Basic game : To fund administrative
costs and hire a graphic designer to produce basic graphics.
Graphic designer : To hire a full time
graphic designer on the project to produce quality graphics.
Multiple environments : For the graphic
designer to be able to create multiple environments in the adventure: marshy,
arid, rocky, jungle, snowy
Light/shadow effects : To develop shadow effects, sunlight effects
during the day and torches/campfires effects at night
Additional quests/donjons : Integration of additional quests, monsters,
dungeons, bosses, treasures, mini-games, items (such as bombs, magical power,
speed boots, water / lava shields, gloves of strength, etc ...)
Level editor : To make the level editor easy to use by the
community, and enable an exchange system of levels / campaigns to make the game
lifespan infinite
Sound
engineer : To hire a sound engineer who will improve the
game's sound effects
Against the clock : Addition of the mode against the clock that will
enable to record your best times replay on specific levels, and to have the
opportunity of watching other players best times replay 
Multiplayer : Addition of the modes : co-op et versus. Several
players can compete or solve side quests online (official campaigns and
campaigns created by players!).
Performance optimization : To finance development in order to
increase : the number of displayable characters/items, the liquids
volume/realism (I would love to see a tsunami destroying everything in its path
in Gravit !)
Ground/scenery distortion : To finance development so bombs are able to
crack open ground or houses and flames are able to burn and attack the wood.
Porting : For
the game to be available on Mac, Linux and Xbox360

Gravit is a 2D
platform game mixing adventure and puzzle. You will be confronted to the end of
the World.
The goal of this
video game is to regroup several originalities around a main idea : a
progressive change in gravity in a classic platform game.
But the word
""classic"" didn't delight us. So we added lots of complementary ideas
designed to help you facing the gravity cataclysm : dynamic fluids for water
and lava, grappling hook, sword of power, temporal vortex, anti-gravity boots...
The scenario has a
real significance in our game to articulate all the elements around a main
story.
As you probably
understood, Gravit’s base is to play with gravity. This last is changing all
along the game going through different steps. But not only does gravity affect
the player. The environment and objects are also subject to its action.
Never forget, gravity
can change any time!







Normal
gravity At the beginning of
the game, the character will be subject to a normal gravity. He can do little
jumps, leap from wall to wall, climb ropes and ladders, carry or throw light
objects. A fall from few meters or a hard impact will be deadly to the
character.
Light
gravity Then the cataclysm
starts, gravity is decreasing of a half. We could believe we are on the moon.
The character can double, even triple the length and height of his jumps. He
can fall from higher level without dying and carry objects twice the initial
weight. With this gravity, the character can reach inaccessible areas.
Being able to cross a ravine of several meters will provide the player with a
sense of power.
Zero
gravity Then comes the most
original part of the game, no gravity at all. Like in the space, the character
is floating in the air and can only turn on himself. But you can still move by
using the scenery elements. You can use bubbles of water floating in the space
to control your movements.
Reverse
gravity As it was not enough,
in this step, gravity loses its control. The character is now attracted by the
sky ! You need to use some elements of the scenery not to fall down in heaven.
Water and lava are flying away to the sky and trees are uprooting.
High
reverse gravity For the last part,
the character will be ejected to the sky. Gravity will be higher than the
initial one. Your weight will be doubled : little jumps, cannot carry
anything... Every action will be an ordeal.
Dynamic environments The scenery elements respond to physical laws.
The character can move objects and cross over unstable obstacles, but beware
of violent shocks and big falls that will be fatal.
Dynamic liquidIn ""Gravit"", the liquid system that is
set up enables to create any kind of hydraulic challenge (Archimedes'
principle, dam, boat, mill, waterfall, ...) or simply reinforces the game
aesthetic by coupling the gravity changes with realistic liquids. In zero
gravity especially, the water will form big bubbles in which the player can
swim to move. The player immersion is complete! (you can say that again !)
Grappling hook The grappling hook is a rope the player can fix
anywhere. Thus, he/she can throw it from one branch to another and overcome
many obstacles.
The sword of power It is a sword able to cut all that surrounds
it. You can build bridges with trees by playing lumberjacks, lock mechanism by
carefully cutting its gears, unlock passages blocked by rocks or cut a house in
half! Your power has no limits! But the sword is also useful to solve tests in
which the mechanism will be based on the objects weight: cutting an object in
half is like dividing its weight by two.
Temporal vortex This mystical object will allow you to save the
world, but also help you to overcome many obstacles that you could not succeed
because of time: door closing too fast, mill running too fast, projectile too
fast to be avoided, …
Antigravity boots Once equipped with these miraculous boots, you
can reverse the character gravity at any time .Walk once on the
ground, then once the ceiling. Some obstacles will force you to use the boots.
Mini games Lots of mini games can be added to Gravit.
Especially thanks to the game physics engine.
Level editor The level editor is a small program that will
enable you (well, mostly us!) to create levels without developing a single line
of code. Thus, you can shape the ground, add items (box, trees, branches, ropes
...), add water, change the gravity, etc. ....
Death To integrate realism in the animation of death, we used
the well-known technique of ragdoll. Each body part of the character (arms,
legs, head) is converted into dynamic objects that independently interact with
its environment.
Music Here are some music samples composed by Samuel PINTO
SOEIRO that we find promising:


ScenarioFor more information about the
scenario, click on the following link :  Game scenario outline



We want to create a whole world !
Not just a game !
When I look at Gravit prototype,
I think that only a coating is missing to make it a small masterpiece. But make
no mistake, a coating worthy of the name requires a lot of work!
For you to get an idea of what
remains to be done : trying to incorporate ideas of original gameplay in
an original scenery that will be in an original scenario with music and graphic
designs in accordance with the set to create an authentic world. Oh ! And
don’t forget that the player must be able to gradually get accustomed to the
game. In short, probably one of the hardest puzzle-game to solve :)
So, with only the two of us, we
find ourselves a little short to accomplish all the tasks incumbent on us. For
this reason, we decided to resort to a donation campaign. In order to fund the
coating worthy of our wildest dreams ! The game will be released whether we
obtain a cash infusion or not. But we do not like to botch the potential of a
game. This is why we appeal to you today.

This game coating only depends on you !






Help
with the funding! You can contribute
to the project, we have plenty of rewards to offer you :) You can also
contribute with the amount of your choice without reward, as a donation. Even $1
represent a lot (really a lot!) to us thanks to the snowball effect!
Talk
about it around you! Even
if you can’t contribute financially to the campaign, you still have several
options to help us. Talk about it to your friends and family, share this page
on Facebook or Twitter. The more you talk about it the more what you may have
invested in the project will be of a better quality! A single drop of water can
make the ocean overflow! Don’t underestimate your power!

This is going to be my major project and I will work on it as a full-time job for a while, at least until the game is released. <i>SCP: Rebirth</i> is a game that is being designed to provide you with a very aesthetic storyline closely related to the SCP Foundation. Your character used to be a member of <a href=""http://www.scp-wiki.net/are-we-cool-yet-hub"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>""Are We Cool Yet?""</i></a> and designed numerous possible world-ending SCPs. Eventually, you were caught by the foundation and thereafter held captive as a Class D for seven years until <i><a href=""http://www.scp-wiki.net/chaos-insurgency-hub"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chaos Insurgency</a></i> raided the foundation you were kept in and broke you out. A strange old man (which you feel is closely related to <a href=""http://www.scp-wiki.net/nobody-hub"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>""Nobody""</i></a>) knocks on your door one day and asks you a life-changing favour, one he wants in return for the <i>Chaos Insurgents</i> breaking you out. They had no idea what they were dealing with, and you were the cause of it all. There is only one way out.<br/><br/>With a decently-sized fun and engaging storyline, the game will feature numerous endings judging by the actions you take during the story and is being developed in the Unity engine. By donating to the IndieGoGo, you will greatly help fund the development as I am currently working on it on my own as a full-time job with absolutely no profits, so funding development is going to hard on my own. The game will be free to play and will be available on Steam. I intend on porting the game to other platforms later on. You are able to view the first reveal of the game on posts on my <a href=""https://patreon.com/GlorifiedPig"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patreon page</a>. Keep in mind that everything seen on this page does not represent the final product at all and will severely change over time.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">About Me</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">I'm a <a href=""http://piggyis.pro"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">young indie game developer</a> and have always been very interested in programming. I have developed many successful modifications for many successful games (some of my mods over 80 000 people have downloaded) and had always loved the concept of getting my work out to the public. After getting out of the baby steps (modifications) and getting into the bigger steps (making video games), it wasn't the easiest transition to make.

Join our verified Discord!About the GameSCP: Rebirth is my latest project and is based on the SCP Universe. This is going to be my major project and I will work on it as a full-time job for a while, at least until the game is released. SCP: Rebirth is a game that is being designed to provide you with a very aesthetic storyline closely related to the SCP Foundation. Your character used to be a member of ""Are We Cool Yet?"" and designed numerous possible world-ending SCPs. Eventually, you were caught by the foundation and thereafter held captive as a Class D for seven years until Chaos Insurgency raided the foundation you were kept in and broke you out. A strange old man (which you feel is closely related to ""Nobody"") knocks on your door one day and asks you a life-changing favour, one he wants in return for the Chaos Insurgents breaking you out. They had no idea what they were dealing with, and you were the cause of it all. There is only one way out.With a decently-sized fun and engaging storyline, the game will feature numerous endings judging by the actions you take during the story and is being developed in the Unity engine. By donating to the IndieGoGo, you will greatly help fund the development as I am currently working on it on my own as a full-time job with absolutely no profits, so funding development is going to hard on my own. The game will be free to play and will be available on Steam. I intend on porting the game to other platforms later on. You are able to view the first reveal of the game on posts on my Patreon page. Keep in mind that everything seen on this page does not represent the final product at all and will severely change over time.About MeI'm a young indie game developer and have always been very interested in programming. I have developed many successful modifications for many successful games (some of my mods over 80 000 people have downloaded) and had always loved the concept of getting my work out to the public. After getting out of the baby steps (modifications) and getting into the bigger steps (making video games), it wasn't the easiest transition to make. Making video games is not easy and can cost a lot of money to produce. After I heard that I can fund a video game that I am going to make, I was fascinated, knowing that I can get some funds to help the game grow to its full potential before it even releases. My only revenue at this point in time is from selling modifications for a game I used to play a lot.What do I get out of backing? Where will the funds go?I'm trying to raise at least one thousand dollars to help fund the production of the game, to spice it up in every little detail and make it as best as I can.

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why so few images/videos/gameplay footages of the game?</h3>
<p>Good Question. We are only two weeks into the game at the moment. The most we have is the story/script of the game. Arts and some small game sequences. Some flowcharts and we are still polishing the battle system.</p>
<p>We will keep updating this weekly or every 3-4 days from now along with our Facebook and Website.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>When is the planned release?</h3>
<p>Target Release would be Q4 2015. We aim to take as much time possible into this game so the finished product would be polished and we can add as much features as we can.<br/></p>
<h3>What platforms will you release to?</h3>PC only at the moment.<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Games have you made before?</h3>A lot! Most are lame from my early days. None of them were sold and only distributed to friends and family. We are thinking of adding them as free downloads to our website. But please...go easy on them as most of them were made when I was 14 (I am 27 now)<br/><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>

</div></div>","Project Summary
<Project Ivalon> is a Classic 2D Mature/Fantasy RPG made using RPG Maker XV Ace, Custom Engine and Custom Ruby Scripts. Ivalon, a world ripe with strife and political intrigue. A world where people born with the ability to use <Incant> termed as <Maharlikas> and normal people called <Jindios> reside. <Jindios> are often cast aside as second-rate citizens while <Maharlikas> are often the ones who holds the seat to power, albeit feared and sometimes discriminated against.The <Rune of Selwyn> is one of the most sought after treasure in <Ivalon>. It has been said to possess infinite power and knowledge and anyone who is able to obtain it will have the ability to manipulate the very fabric of reality.Rauss, an adventurer and fame/fortune seeker is on a quest to obtain the <Rune> and for what reason? To obtain riches beyond imagining and to get a status above the small folks of Ivalon. But is that all?

Why so few images/videos/gameplay footages of the game?
Good Question. We are only two weeks into the game at the moment. The most we have is the story/script of the game. Arts and some small game sequences. Some flowcharts and we are still polishing the battle system.
We will keep updating this weekly or every 3-4 days from now along with our Facebook and Website.

When is the planned release?
Target Release would be Q4 2015. We aim to take as much time possible into this game so the finished product would be polished and we can add as much features as we can.
What platforms will you release to?PC only at the moment.

What Games have you made before?A lot! Most are lame from my early days. None of them were sold and only distributed to friends and family. We are thinking of adding them as free downloads to our website. But please...go easy on them as most of them were made when I was 14 (I am 27 now)

<p>Welcome to the Indiegogo project page for Vertigo Games’ <em>World of Diving</em>, the online multiplayer dive game that comes with full Oculus Rift support. We recreate the world of wonder and discovery that is at the bottom of the ocean – together with you.</p>
<p>One of the questions that we get asked a lot is <em>why</em>? Why do we want to create a diving game so much? And yes, there is a short and sweet answer: our creative director Richard Stitselaar is an avid scuba diver, and through his enthusiasm and many (many) stories of cave diving, wreck diving and visiting <a href=""http://www.driftblue.com/blog/general/scuba-diving-in-the-florida-keys-with-jesus-of-the-deep-inc-video//"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this</a> enormous statue, he has basically filled the heads of our entire team with vivid images of clear blue, Caribbean water.</p>
<p><em><img alt=""Richard Diver"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.vertigo-games.com/Indiegogo/Richard_Diver.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Richard Diver""/></em></p>
<p>This got us thinking: we should bring diving, an exhilarating and exotic experience, within reach for people around the globe regardless of their geographical location. This is something we can and want to do – together with you.</p>
<p><em>World of Diving</em> is now in its early prototype phase, and with your support we can keep growing the game, into a huge, populated digital diving realm. If we reach our goal <em>World of Diving </em>will be ready for its release on PC, Mac and Linux in early 2014. But that’s not all: <em>World of Diving </em>is not only playable using a normal monitor, it also supports the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset for a truly *immersive* experience! And we haven’t even mentioned our top-secret iPad stretch goal, which we will reveal later.</p>
<p>All that is missing now is you! We’re not just asking you for your money – we’d also like you to take part in its creation through our community-driven development.</p>
<p>Will you help us out?</p>
<h1><img alt=""What is World of Diving"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.vertigo-games.com/Indiegogo/whatisworldof.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""What is World of Diving""/></h1>
<p><em>World of Diving </em>is the first online multiplayer diving game, with which we will recreate that feeling of wonder and discovery you get at the bottom of the ocean. Our team is all set to take you on the otherworldly experience that is <em>World of Diving</em> - all from the comfort of your own (hopefully quite dry) home.</p>
<p>Starting out in the Caribbean, you can enjoy the real-world diving spots that were recreated by our team, while the entire world’s oceans are waiting for you to explore thanks to a technique called procedural generation.</p>
<p>While <em>World of Diving </em>will appeal to both hardcore simulation fans and casual diving enthusiasts, we feel it is important to focus our development efforts on making the world fun… and not just a mathematical model. World of Diving will be a place for you to hang out with your friends - whether you have met them in or outside of the game – where you can swim with sea turtles, hunt for the great white shark or party on your own luxury yacht.</p>

<p>Vertigo Games is a small Dutch game developer located in the city of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. But instead of just talking about our company, we would much rather introduce you to some of the people who make it an interesting and creative workplace:</p>
<p><em>“As an enthusiastic scuba diver, it’s really exciting for me to work on a game which brings that experience within reach of the coffee table.” <br/></em><em>- </em>Richard Stitselaar, Creative Director</p>
<p><em>“I’ve always wanted to work on a game in which I had an opportunity to simulate schools of fish in a realistic manner. On the few occasions I was privileged enough to witness this kind of behavior in real life, I found it absolutely mesmerizing.”<br/></em><em>- </em>Tristan Lambert, Technical Director</p>
<p><em>“Real-life diving burns a lot of your money before you have even touched the surface of the ocean. World of Diving lets you dip into any part of the deep blue sea within seconds and guarantees a unique experience every single time.”<br/>- </em>Peter Deurloo, Lead Designer</p>
<p><em><img alt=""Team Photo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.vertigo-games.com/Indiegogo/Team_Photo.JPG"" src="""" style="""" title=""Team Photo""/></em></p>
<p>Our team has worked on a mix of entertainment and serious games: the perfect combined experience to build a game like <em>World of Diving. </em>These days, our team is creating some of the most advanced and realistic educational and serious games in the world, but our dream to create entertainment games has never been stronger.</p>
<h1><img alt=""Endorsements"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.vertigo-games.com/Indiegogo/endorsements.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Endorsements""/></h1>
<p>In case you are wondering what we did before we started working on this project: before we entered serious gaming, we created the adventure series <em>Adam’s Venture, </em>and these were some of the responses:</p>
<p><em>“The gorgeous visuals are accented with atmospheric touches (…) The environments are alive and rich with detail.” – </em>AdventureClassicGaming.com</p>
<p><em>“If you are constantly on the lookout for those rarve adventures with truly tough logic puzzles, this game is a must-play”.</em> – Gameboomers.com</p>
<p><em>“Kudos goes out to Vertigo for putting in the extra effort that most developers overlook.” –Gameindustry.com</em></p>

<p>As you can see in our video, we have already invested a great deal into the prototype of <em>World of Diving</em>, and we will continue to do so. However, we have learned from experience that the amount of required time, effort and money that is required to turn a prototype into a fun, polished and bug-free game is enormous. To make sure that we can finish <em>World of Diving</em> before we all turn into old men and ladies, we need your help!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, funding troubles are typical for the game development world, as legendary game developers like Double Fine’s Tim Schafer have explained before us: there’s no way to get funding for the amount of innovation that we are proposing, as publishers are hesitant to take risks and release creative control. With your help, we can both solve this problem <em>and</em> keep the development process of <em>World of Diving </em>as dynamic and transparent as possible, allowing us to keep an open dialogue with our community and incorporate your feedback throughout the development.</p>
<p><em>World of Diving</em> is now in its early prototype phase, and we have big plans to keep growing the game and the community into a huge, populated digital world that is all about diving – by yourself and together with friends. We’ve got ambitious stretch goals too, which will “surface” here as the campaign progresses.</p>

<p><em>World of Diving </em>and our entire team need your help!</p>
<h1><img alt=""What is your money going toward?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.vertigo-games.com/Indiegogo/moneytoward.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""What is your money going toward?""/></h1>
<p>Apart from our own investment, we need a total of $75,000 to cover the development costs for <em>World of Diving</em>. You might have realized that this budget is actually quite modest for a game of this type and magnitude, and are now wondering how it can be so cheap. In contrast to many other game development companies, we are able to switch key people between <em>World of Diving </em>and our other projects only as needed, which means that we are able to make full use of every single contribution.

Here is the text of the original campaign:
Update
First early gameplay footage. Share your reactions in the comment section! 

Welcome to the Indiegogo project page for Vertigo Games’ World of Diving, the online multiplayer dive game that comes with full Oculus Rift support. We recreate the world of wonder and discovery that is at the bottom of the ocean – together with you.
One of the questions that we get asked a lot is why? Why do we want to create a diving game so much? And yes, there is a short and sweet answer: our creative director Richard Stitselaar is an avid scuba diver, and through his enthusiasm and many (many) stories of cave diving, wreck diving and visiting this enormous statue, he has basically filled the heads of our entire team with vivid images of clear blue, Caribbean water.

This got us thinking: we should bring diving, an exhilarating and exotic experience, within reach for people around the globe regardless of their geographical location. This is something we can and want to do – together with you.
World of Diving is now in its early prototype phase, and with your support we can keep growing the game, into a huge, populated digital diving realm. If we reach our goal World of Diving will be ready for its release on PC, Mac and Linux in early 2014. But that’s not all: World of Diving is not only playable using a normal monitor, it also supports the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset for a truly *immersive* experience! And we haven’t even mentioned our top-secret iPad stretch goal, which we will reveal later.
All that is missing now is you! We’re not just asking you for your money – we’d also like you to take part in its creation through our community-driven development.
Will you help us out?

World of Diving is the first online multiplayer diving game, with which we will recreate that feeling of wonder and discovery you get at the bottom of the ocean. Our team is all set to take you on the otherworldly experience that is World of Diving - all from the comfort of your own (hopefully quite dry) home.
Starting out in the Caribbean, you can enjoy the real-world diving spots that were recreated by our team, while the entire world’s oceans are waiting for you to explore thanks to a technique called procedural generation.
While World of Diving will appeal to both hardcore simulation fans and casual diving enthusiasts, we feel it is important to focus our development efforts on making the world fun… and not just a mathematical model. World of Diving will be a place for you to hang out with your friends - whether you have met them in or outside of the game – where you can swim with sea turtles, hunt for the great white shark or party on your own luxury yacht.
 
 


We have set several key design goals that will make World of Diving the ultimate digital diving experience. Of course we will want to hear your opinion as well, as we will incorporate some of your best ideas into our development.

Visit astonishing real-world diving spots, manually brought to life by our design team.
Explore the Earth’s oceans without limitation thanks to procedurally generated environments.
Customize your character, from body type, face and hair style to clothing and accessories.
Team up and explore with friends or one of your NPC companions.
Over a hundred collectable species, many of which add their unique benefit to your diving skill.
Compete with friend and foe over ancient treasure and in exciting diving challenges.
Discover rusty ship wrecks, World War II submarines and eerie underwater caverns.
Take part in the community and direct the development of the gameplay and in-game items.
Play using the Oculus Rift for the full immersive experience, or use a traditional monitor.
For more information about the Oculus Rift, watch this informative demo video: 
    

Vertigo Games is a small Dutch game developer located in the city of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. But instead of just talking about our company, we would much rather introduce you to some of the people who make it an interesting and creative workplace:
“As an enthusiastic scuba diver, it’s really exciting for me to work on a game which brings that experience within reach of the coffee table.” - Richard Stitselaar, Creative Director
“I’ve always wanted to work on a game in which I had an opportunity to simulate schools of fish in a realistic manner. On the few occasions I was privileged enough to witness this kind of behavior in real life, I found it absolutely mesmerizing.”- Tristan Lambert, Technical Director
“Real-life diving burns a lot of your money before you have even touched the surface of the ocean. World of Diving lets you dip into any part of the deep blue sea within seconds and guarantees a unique experience every single time.”- Peter Deurloo, Lead Designer

Our team has worked on a mix of entertainment and serious games: the perfect combined experience to build a game like World of Diving. These days, our team is creating some of the most advanced and realistic educational and serious games in the world, but our dream to create entertainment games has never been stronger.

In case you are wondering what we did before we started working on this project: before we entered serious gaming, we created the adventure series Adam’s Venture, and these were some of the responses:
“The gorgeous visuals are accented with atmospheric touches (…) The environments are alive and rich with detail.” – AdventureClassicGaming.com
“If you are constantly on the lookout for those rarve adventures with truly tough logic puzzles, this game is a must-play”. – Gameboomers.com
“Kudos goes out to Vertigo for putting in the extra effort that most developers overlook.” –Gameindustry.com


As you can see in our video, we have already invested a great deal into the prototype of World of Diving, and we will continue to do so. However, we have learned from experience that the amount of required time, effort and money that is required to turn a prototype into a fun, polished and bug-free game is enormous. To make sure that we can finish World of Diving before we all turn into old men and ladies, we need your help!
Unfortunately, funding troubles are typical for the game development world, as legendary game developers like Double Fine’s Tim Schafer have explained before us: there’s no way to get funding for the amount of innovation that we are proposing, as publishers are hesitant to take risks and release creative control. With your help, we can both solve this problem and keep the development process of World of Diving as dynamic and transparent as possible, allowing us to keep an open dialogue with our community and incorporate your feedback throughout the development.
World of Diving is now in its early prototype phase, and we have big plans to keep growing the game and the community into a huge, populated digital world that is all about diving – by yourself and together with friends. We’ve got ambitious stretch goals too, which will “surface” here as the campaign progresses.

World of Diving and our entire team need your help!

Apart from our own investment, we need a total of $75,000 to cover the development costs for World of Diving. You might have realized that this budget is actually quite modest for a game of this type and magnitude, and are now wondering how it can be so cheap. In contrast to many other game development companies, we are able to switch key people between World of Diving and our other projects only as needed, which means that we are able to make full use of every single contribution. Moreover, we’ve already got the infrastructure, a huge stash of ready-to-use content and not to mention a lot of experience from our previous entertainment and serious games to develop World of Diving.
Here’s a rough breakdown of where your money will go to:
      
Please note that this is a FIXED FUNDING CAMPAIGN, which means that if we do not reach our goal, we won’t receive any of the money that is donated. This will make all of us really, really sad, and you wouldn’t want that on your conscience, so please help us out! The sooner our goal is reached, the sooner we can start to finish the game.

Community-driven development has a very important role in this project. As a member of our community you’ll be able to actively participate and direct the development of World of Diving, making sure that the finished game will not just be ourgame but your game as well.
Here are just a few examples of how you can take part:

Community voting
Idea contribution
Content design
Spreading the word

Finally, the rewards! ALL backers will gain access to the official World of Diving community and can then start giving their input and feedback on the development straight away.
We recommend a pledge of at least $15, which entitles you to a digital copy of the full, ready-to-play World of Diving game upon launch for PC, Mac and Linux, as well as all its future expansions. From $20 you will also have access to the closed beta of World of Diving, which means that you will be one of the first people in the world to plunge into its clear blue waters – everything you achieve and collect during the closed beta period will transfer to your permanent account, which gives you a head start on everyone else!

The initial activity of the company was solely hosting video games servers. 2011 meant a great leap forward for our company, as we signed a collaboration agreement on a project with a Chinese game developer. In 2013 we started toying with the idea of developing our own video game. Gradually, we began collecting thoughts, inspirations and ideas and initiated our MyVill project. In 2015 we managed to get a bank loan for further project development. The loan was supported by The Bohemian-Moravian Guarantee and Development Bank, which allowed us to hire one more programmer to join our team. However, we are currently facing a difficult situation, when we lack additional funding to complete our project. We have performed an immense portion of work on MyVill, which is at ‘Pre-Alpha version’ stage at the moment. We strongly believe in our project and are proud of our work and would like to ask for your financial support to be able to continue to develop and release this 3D MMORPG game. I am confident to say, that we will be able to make a great progress and complete the game with your kind support.

The initial activity of the company was solely hosting video games servers. 2011 meant a great leap forward for our company, as we signed a collaboration agreement on a project with a Chinese game developer. In 2013 we started toying with the idea of developing our own video game. Gradually, we began collecting thoughts, inspirations and ideas and initiated our MyVill project. In 2015 we managed to get a bank loan for further project development. The loan was supported by The Bohemian-Moravian Guarantee and Development Bank, which allowed us to hire one more programmer to join our team. However, we are currently facing a difficult situation, when we lack additional funding to complete our project. We have performed an immense portion of work on MyVill, which is at ‘Pre-Alpha version’ stage at the moment. We strongly believe in our project and are proud of our work and would like to ask for your financial support to be able to continue to develop and release this 3D MMORPG game. I am confident to say, that we will be able to make a great progress and complete the game with your kind support. The mission of our small company is to continue to develop more MMO projects for the video game Universe.MyVill is an action 3D MMORPG TPS construction game with ‘Survival’ elements, set in the ancient world of craftsmen and merchants. The concept of the game is to escape everyday life and enter the world of ancient craftsmanship with the possibility of building private and public spaces, cultivation, domestic animals breeding, hunting and going on looting war expeditions with other players. Teamwork, sophisticated cultivation system and its connection with the environment, along with interconnection of the players with the surroundings are the main elements of the game. MyVill combines entertaining and educational elements at the same time. Most of the game elements are inspired by reality.We plan to develop the game from the Pre-Alpha version to the next one with improved graphic aspects, while keeping the initial essence and fun style visualization. COMPLETE      UNFINISHED      COMPLETE BEFORE OBT      DURING OBT  Multilangual system that allows users to play in any of supported languages with one client Launcher with settings and game updates Game reload system with the option of reloading all definitions, task, current score, etc., while the game is running Designing basic UI and its functionality (menu, inventory, friends list administration, quick contact, PM, chat, player character, tasks) Multisample anti-aliasing Using cryptography for secure network communication Graphic features for player characters personification Implementation of possibility of speech for NPC character Usage of cutting-edge scripting technologies for quest system and in-game dialogs (Lua, Python) Landscape Appearance  Weather Variability – there are varieties of constantly changing weather, several types of rain with different intensity of rainfall, overcast and several forms of sunny weather. Changing weather patterns affect the growth of trees, shrubs, plants and mushrooms, as well as cultivation itself as the crops have different requirements for successful growth. The player has to be aware of the weather and take it into account during the growing season. Dynamic Landscape Appearance – all trees, shrubs, plants and mushrooms don’t have a stable place and grow spontaneously in areas where the growth can be expected. Phenological Phases – all trees, shrubs, plants and mushrooms are not only a static model. They grow and undergo different phenological phases and eventually die. It is only up to the players, if they manage to use the plants before they die. For example, trees have 20 growth phases with a blooming phase, fruit bearing phase and dying phase. Additionally, the trees don’t always reach the final phase and die prematurely. Interaction – all trees, shrubs, plants and mushrooms can be used. It is possible to harvest them or harvest their fruits, or cut the trees down for firewood. Symbiosis – there is a relationship between certain trees, shrubs, plants and mushrooms. For instance: the majority of mushrooms grow nearby a tree that is vital for their growth.

 

 

Village and Town System 
 Village Settlement – the player can settle down in any village if there is space and land for him. He can settle down in any place he desires, nearby his friends or he can also be the first inhabitant of uninhabited village and wait for new neighbors. There is no limit regarding the population of the village, however the settlement area in each village is limited. Coexistence and Village Development – the inhabitants take part in the village development. They contribute by paying taxes, they have their vote regarding investments and thanks to that NPC characters providing selected craftsmanship services can move into the village. Consequently, the players no longer have to travel to NPC characters that live in regional or royal towns. This allows the player character to use saved time to his advantage. Regional and Royal Towns Development – each village fall under a certain regional or royal town. The villagers pay taxes to participate to towns developments. Consequently these towns develop certain business and military characteristics, which enables them to interact with population of other kingdoms. Relocation – sophisticated game system allows the players to get a plot in another village and leave the original plot. The player isn’t bound to live in the village he originally chose. Freedom of Movement – the player is allowed to move freely in all villages, regional and royal towns within a kingdom. The player can visit other players on their land unless the land is locked. He can also visit towns of other kingdoms to do trading or loot; however his royal town must be on a level that allows such actions of other kingdoms.
Private Land 
 Land Size – each player has the option to acquire his own land (see Village Settlement). He can expand his property if there is a free space around his land and the land isn’t owned by someone else. The land must be within the settlement area. Use of Land – the player can use his land for cultivation, animal breeding, doing craftsmanship or quarrying. He is allowed to do all the above-mentioned activities all together. He can build his own water well to have private water source. Land Fencing – it is possible to build a fence around own land; the appearance and color of the fence can be changed. It is possible to prevent other players from entering the property by locking it.
Dwelling 
 Private Dwelling – the player can also use his land to build a dwelling where he can rest in bed, cook, bake and store his things so he doesn’t have to carry them around. The space can be used for storing hay, etc. Building a Dwelling – building a dwelling isn’t a static process when a ready-made house appears on a chosen site. It is a gradual process that has several stages. It starts by constructing a foundation, exterior walls, roof trussing and roof.  It goes through other steps until completing the house. Building Materials and Builders – each player that decides to build his own dwelling, must ensure the material needed for individual stages of the building process. If he isn’t a builder himself and isn’t able to build himself, he must find someone to help him, including the NPC craftsmen, friends and other players.  Because of the different stages of building process, the player needs different types of builders and craftsmen, as in real life; a stonemason, mason, carpenter, roofer, joiner and cabinet maker. Variable Dwelling Appearance – the player has the option to choose the color of the house to his liking. It is possible to change the color of exterior and interior walls, vaults, roofing, doors, windows and other elements. The dwelling can be extended in order to have more space for additional equipment. In case the player no longer needs a large house the size can be reduced. It is also possible to adapt the dwelling to the requirements of a certain handicraft. E.g., the player can transform his house into a windmill to provide a service for other players.
Player Character 
 No Additional Abilities – the player doesn’t have the option to enhance his abilities. The system of the game modifies the abilities based on the activities of the character. Feeding and Overfeeding – it is necessary to feed the character on regular basis. Food influences the abilities and performance of the character. In case the character is hungry overeats, he doesn’t manage to handle basic tasks or may have a low performance level. No Appetite – the character refuses to eat the type of food, which he doesn’t like. He may even refuse to eat the food that he likes in case he consumed too much of it in a short period of time. As a result, the player can't feed the character with the same type of food all the time. Load Capacity of the Character – each character has got own specific load capacity, which may be influenced by his lifestyle. The load capacity of the equipment is also important, as is the load capacity of the character. Appearance of the Character – the player can choose either male or female character with the option to change the original appearance. It is possible to be different from the other players’ characters. The player can change many parts of the equipment, majority of which is visible. There are different accessories, many types of hairstyles, etc. Regarding the hairstyle, the player can’t change it as he pleases like in other games. He can only style it according to the current length of the hair or beard as hair and beard of the character grow during the game. Short hairstyles are achieved by getting a haircut. In case of a long hairstyle desire, the hair must simply grow.
Trade
 Trading Between the Players – trade between players of the same kingdom takes place in markets in regional and royal towns. Trade between players of different kingdoms is only possible in royal towns. Trading with NPC – trade with NPC characters is possible in villages, regional and royal towns. Roving NPC Merchants – there are wandering NPC merchants with a convenient offer or demand appearing in random places. The players that happen to be at the right time in the right place and meet these merchants can use it to own benefit.
Gear and Equipment
 Deterioration – all gear, equipment, instruments and tools deteriorate. Deterioration can be repaired to certain extent. It is necessary to get new equipment in case of a great deterioration. Equipment Change – the player isn’t reliant on one static equipment placed on the character, he can have the equipment that he chooses himself. If he chooses a shoulder sack, he will have items that he previously placed in the sack. If he chooses a back basket, he will have items that he previously placed in the back basket.
Food
 Quality and Duration – each food have own quality and duration. If the player character doesn’t consume his food supplies within a certain period they will simply go bad. Waste Impact on Things of Perishable Nature – waste has a negative impact on things of perishable nature if stored together.  In this case durability period is shorter.  The greater the amounts of waste the grater the negative impact. Waste Impact on Things of Non-Perishable Nature – if waste in advanced stage of decay is stored together with other items even of non-perishable nature, they will suffer damage altogether with case in which they are stored (i.e. clothes).

Cultivation

 Cultivated Plants Growth – all cultivated trees, shrubs and other plants are not just a static model. They gradually grow and their development has ten phenological stages at the minimum and they eventually die. Soil Properties – each field has got own characteristics that constantly change. The change is influenced by factors such as four types of nutrients, moister, permeability and acidity. Special Requirements of Cultivated Plants – all cultivated trees, shrubs and other plants have their special requirements towards nutrients, moister, etc., for successful growth. These factors are important to create the required environment to ensure good results and reach high yields. Weather Impact on Properties of Soil – the weather influences all soil properties and soil properties impact the cultivation. For instance, if there is a long spell of rainy weather it might result in over moisturizing. The player has to ensure water during long spells of drought in order to prevent the plants from drying.  Partial Harvest – one of the conveniences is that if the character grows for example carrots, he doesn’t have to harvest all of them at the time of harvest. The player can only harvest the amount of carrots he needs instead of harvesting the whole field. Compost – the player has got the possibility to collect decayed plants and compost them. The compost can be used as field fertilizer.
Other Forms of Specialization
 No Determined Specialization – the player doesn’t have to choose characters specialization at the beginning of the game as in the majority of similar type of games. He does what he likes during the game. He can improve in what he likes and through that he reaches higher levels and gains more options. Whenever he decides to engage in something else, he simply can do so. The character starts to improve in other specializations; however, according to his possibilities he starts gradually forgetting the skills from the previous specialization and replaces it by new ones. Types of Specialization – the main specializations are: cultivation, breeding, quarrying, wild animals hunting and combat. The secondary specializations are many types of handicraft professions such as, miller, blacksmith, carpenter, cook, stonemason, roofer and many more. The secondary specializations are in some cases dependent on the players dwelling, which must be adapted for the specialization; for instance, the dwelling must be rebuilt into a windmill. Employment with NPC – it is possible to employ the player character with a NPC craftsman (e.g. a miller). This means that by completing tasks given by NPC, the character gains basic experience and after completing all given tasks the character himself can evolve and become a craftsman in the given field. NPC Replacement – the player character that mastered one of the handicrafts and meets the requirements to perform the handicraft can replace any NPC craftsman in his village. It is important to build good relationships with neighbors and be aware of the team spirit, as the neighbors can choose between the player character and NPC craftsman.
Fights
 PvP Fights – PvP fights with the goal to loot, happen daily at regular times in form of war expeditions to other kingdoms. The battles take place in regional towns and nearby areas. PvE Fights – PvE fights in form of wild animal hunting or expeditions to islands controlled by NPC characters. Looting – the goal of war expeditions is a gradual gaining of war loot and carrying it to the boat. The player characters of the invaded kingdom try to prevent it. It is important to carry as much loot as possible to the boat before the boat with the player characters takes off to return. War Expedition Supplies – the player characters have to store enough of supplies before going onto a war expedition. The player character may use his personal space to store his equipment and supplies during the war looting.
Marriage
 Marriage with NPC Partner – intermarriage between two player characters isn’t possible as it would be too easy. After meeting certain conditions, there will be a loving NPC partner waiting for the player character. Taking Care of NPC Partner – if the player character married a NPC character, he is obliged to take care of himself and the partner as well. It is necessary to provide food and everything else the other partner may need in order to be happy. Automation of Certain Processes – a reward for taking care of NPC partner is an automation of certain processes of the player character. Based on the reached marriage level, certain activities such as watering plants, harvesting, sale, etc., may be passed onto the NPC partner, by which the player character has time to gain other skills and experience. It is important to mention that the NPC partner will be performing given tasks even if the player character isn’t present and even when he is in offline state. Hidden Characteristics of NPC Partner – every NPC partner has got specific hidden characteristics that often give the player character hard time. The partner might cosume more food than originally expected, he might require more presents and attention and at times he keeps things only for himself. NPC Partner Dissatisfaction – if the NPC partner feels undervalued, the marriage level will decrease and the possibility of automation will be lower. It is also possible, that the NPC partner leaves the player character. If the player character takes good care of his NPC partner his reward will be comfort and everyday tasks will be easier to fulfill. Divorcing NPC Partner – divorce is possible under certain conditions. The marriage level must be low enough so the marriage can be considered dysfunctional.
Localization
 Main language – The game will be fully translated to English and Czech language at the time of OBT relase. Our team will also provide support in both these languages. Other languages – we are planning to translate the game to other languages like Spanish, French, Portugal, German, Polish and Russian, which will be done gradually during OBT.

She gave birth to their son Myalos, a demigod with an ability that would let him build a world in a different dimension, which he could manage as he wanted. His mission was to set balance on Earth, by building a road that would lead him to all Gods, to conquer and strip them of their powers. But most importantly, he has to defeat the strongest one of all, his father, Zeus.  The BETA version of the game is here!

    Match two similar images: think, strategize, play!  Challenge your friends in the multiplayer mode!  Fight for the first place in the Leaderboard! 

 
 
 It started as a small idea, a wish to build something for people, for them to improve their memory and focus, by using dynamic gameplay that lets players apply different strategies to defeat their enemies with their unique abilities.  We’ve spent all of our resources on the amazing development team that helped this project come to life. As we continued to work on it we realized its true potential, so we wanted to grow more. We launched in beta but as time passed, the needs started to get bigger but our financial resources didn’t.  By early December, so we can achieve our goal and develop the game. Here is what we plan to do with the money.    We said we wanted to be different so this is one of our stretch goals: offer players an experience of a higher impact, taking the winning challenge to a whole new level.  An in-game currency which will grant you the chance to step up your game and bet against other players, with the possibility to withdraw.The plan is to create an intense, competitive yet simple system where players can earn real money by playing exclusively based on their skills and not on their luck.  Imagine playing simply based on:
Skills only - use yours and win, luck has nothing to do with it.
Fairness - every player has equal chances as every game is played on the same gameboard.
Time - the games are short, you don’t have to invest a lot of time, you just have to play smart.

<p><strong>Terran Shield</strong> is a tactical underwater and above water turn-based game where you must defend the Earth against an unexpected alien invasion.</p>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/kXpuWZp.gif"" src=""""/></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Continuing in the line of <strong>X-Com</strong> and <strong>Jagged Alliance</strong> series, Terran Shield proposes new gameplay features and a rich and detailed graphic style developed using the powerful <i>Unreal Engine 4</i>. Furthermore, a complex AI that learns and adapts to the player's style will challenge them to play at their best, crippling their efforts to save humanity from the menace of the infamous alien rulers <i>""The Council of The Six""</i>!</p>
<p>Some of the important features that Terran Shield brings to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>A</strong> <strong>Time Units</strong> based central mechanic to sustain a multitude of gameplay actions that can be executed in any order, for a rich and complex gameplay;</li>
<li> <i><strong>The Six Headed Hydra AI</strong>,</i> which can gather resources from the ocean bed, expand, attack player's bases, research new tech, manufacture weapons and breed minions. Also, on higher difficulty levels, it analyzes the player’s game style and reacts to it, tricking him and exploiting his weaknesses;</li>
<li> <strong>A reaction fire system</strong> (old <strong>X-Com</strong> games style) combined with <strong>the interrupt system</strong> (<strong>Jagged Alliance</strong> style), that make for a dynamic combat gameplay on the adversary turn;</li>
<li> <strong>A complex Inventory</strong> menu that allows the player to pick up items, dead or stunned aliens, weapons and ammo from the floor, change weapons, change weapon's ammo etc.</li>
<li> <strong>Top view base management</strong> with building modules: in case of an alien base attack, the module arrangement is crucial because if the aliens reach critical areas they can steal info or even destroy the human base; </li>
<li> <strong>Underwater and land environment</strong> generated random maps, each with their unique characteristics and gameplay style;</li>
<li> <strong>The upgradable transport</strong> and battle vehicle <strong>The Squid</strong>, which can be specialized through a unique research tree at player's liking;  </li>
<li> <strong>The Aquanaut and Soldiers</strong> <strong>abilities </strong>that will improve after every mission, in direct relationship with their usage; also, unique perks that specialize the unit and make it more powerful; these can be unlocked for every human unit (scientists, too); </li>
<li> <strong>Fully destructible environment</strong> and assets powered by Niagara VFX toolset;</li>
<li> <strong>Full 3D graphics</strong> with <strong>high definition textures</strong> and <strong>dynamic lighting</strong>.</li>

</div><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Terran Shield playthrough on Superhuman (Alpha demo )</i></p><p>The aliens will take no prisoners and will fight to the last one. They are faster, with more Time Units, more Stamina and they have a 320 degree arch vision due to their laterally placed eyes. They see better in this jungle environment than us and it is likely they will spot us well before we spot them.</p><p>In addition, they are equipped with the powerful Sonic Gun that is extremely precise at any range and has a tremendous destructive power. Also watch out for the mighty alien superblaster grenade, with a smaller explosive range than ours, but with more firepower and longer throw range.</p><p>Last but not least: do not hastily engage on higher difficulty levels from the beginning.

One of the main features a TBS can employ to achieve this are the <strong>Time Units</strong>.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/0nNZhf5.gif"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The player is aided to better manage the soldier time units by the moving area graphic representation.

There are seven types of damage for the tactical combat (Battlescape) and three types of damage (kinetic/explosive, electric, sonic) for the Geoscape battles.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575087682/ey0i0idetyxmhckihpym.png"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Stances</strong></h3><p>Another feature that takes benefit from the time units game mechanics are the stances that the soldier can have during combat. All the stances have their benefits and drawbacks. For the Air Force soldiers, the crouch and prone stances improve the aim, decreasing the chance to be hit by the aliens at the same time, but they lower the movement speed of the unit making the soldier vulnerable to enemy reaction fire.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/LJ9yILW.gif"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The aim of the soldier is enhanced by 7% if going into crouch stance.

The last two are available when the aquanaut finds something solid to grip himself onto, in order to avoid being snaked by underwater currents and miss the shoot.</p><h3><strong>Geoscape and base building</strong></h3><p>The Geoscape is the game level where the player can construct bases, intercept hostile alien crafts, launch missions, harass alien harvesting sites and bases. It will have all the old features of the ‘90s old and loved TBS games, plus some of the new features that we have in mind for our game.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/dK9dyL5.gif"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The Squid detecting an alien base and targeting an alien medium fighter.</i></p><h3><strong>Building the environment and the destructible assets</strong></h3><p>The environment possesses resistances to certain damage, as well as vulnerabilities.

Having various heights on the terrain makes the random module placement very difficult to design because the edges of the modules won’t match perfectly. For the creation of a real generated terrain from modules we need additional financial resources. Until then, the current setup can make several different maps for the same landscape map, because the assets that lay over it are very diverse. For instance, on the same structure map, we can have in the same place rocks, or a building, or a forest.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/JvcWL0n.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><i>More about the game can be found <a href=""http://www.terran-shield.com/game/thegame.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</i></p><h3><strong>The AI</strong></h3><p>Having Razvan Florian, one of the lead scientists on neural networks in our team will also aid us in this difficult endeavour.

Well adapted to an underwater environment, it uses its strong tail to swim fast and to suddenly change direction.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/gI97utp.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>Its large eyes enable it to see very well in limited lighting conditions and the electro-sensors provide the ability to orientate in muddy waters. On its toes the Ka-Um-La has gecko-like pads, which can be used to climb vertical walls, thus making it a formidable foe in urban areas.</p><h3><strong><i>Jellyfish Sentry</i></strong></h3><p>This strange creature, named the Jellyfish Sentry by the aquanauts, is a gelatinous invertebrate that has received several unknown device implants at the hand of its alien overlords.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/TNzsAYJ.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>Due to its bioluminescent bacteria pouch, which can be used as a beacon, we can assume that this creature is used as a scout, uncovering the terrain and dangers that lie ahead of the alien assault units. Being a transparent creature makes it very difficult to detect in an underwater environment. The weak electrical signals it generates make it nearly invisible to the aquanauts' sensors and therefore extra effort is required to locate this perfect alien spy.</p><h3><i><strong>Ud'Glee</strong></i></h3><p><strong>Ripper, killer, monster.</strong></p><p>The incarnation of all the horrors lurking and hiding in the dark depths of the oceans.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575601589/k4fly9wz48emhav6vpj1.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The large eyes and the small fluorescent lure on its forehead are indicative of a creature that is very well adapted to the dark ocean depths. It comes as no surprise that the 6 alien rulers have assigned the sonic gun to this monster, given that its vision and perception area in an aquatic environment are unparalleled. If the aliens have more specimens of this living horror in their army, then it seems that we have already lost control over the Earth’s oceans! The only way for us to regain it and have a chance to stop the alien invasion is to capture and research one of those sonic guns, the weapon this monster handles with ease. But that is easier said than done…</p><p><i>More about the aliens can be found <a href=""http://www.terran-shield.com/game/aliens.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></i>.</p><h3><strong>Alien weapons</strong></h3><p>Designing the alien weapons was not an easy task. They must be designed and manufactured underwater by the alien scientists, so we had to invent a totally new manufacturing process. Also, they have to work in the air as well as underwater and they should be produced in large numbers in a short time.</p><p><strong>The Gel Gun</strong></p><p>The gel gun is designed to isolate the enemies by forcing them to avoid the areas covered in the weapon`s gel and thus forcing them to reveal their position.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/u0ifmnr.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>The weapon can also be used to capture enemies that have had the misfortune of becoming trapped in the gel. The cartridge launched by the gel gun is propelled only a relatively short distance by means of a chemical reaction in the weapon. Once the cartridge slows down, it opens up and releases a powder which, when in contact with the surrounding water transforms into a sticky gel, forming a compact, irregular mass of approximately 6 meters in diameter. Any creature that becomes trapped in the gel will find it very difficult to become unstuck, as the gel acts like a spider web.</p><h3><strong>Sonic Gun</strong></h3><p>Unsurprisingly, the sonic gun is the main assault weapon used by the alien forces. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/kdu3jb6.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>The technology behind this artifact is incredible. Human researchers have admitted that even though they have a partial understanding of how the weapon works, they have no theory that can explain the existence of an energy pulse that can maintain the amplified sonic waves and only release them when coming into contact with a solid surface. The nature of the type of energy capable of moving at the speed of sound, while encapsulating the sound waves produced by the weapon, is entirely unknown to humans.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575602308/xoswwfbmibifsqcehheo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>The Squid</strong></h3><p>During the whole game, the main and most powerful Terran Shield ship and transport will be the Squid.

They can have alien containment modules, sub pens, sonars, living facilities, but no manufacturing of research facility.

Terran Shield is a tactical underwater and above water turn-based game where you must defend the Earth against an unexpected alien invasion.

 
Continuing in the line of X-Com and Jagged Alliance series, Terran Shield proposes new gameplay features and a rich and detailed graphic style developed using the powerful Unreal Engine 4. Furthermore, a complex AI that learns and adapts to the player's style will challenge them to play at their best, crippling their efforts to save humanity from the menace of the infamous alien rulers ""The Council of The Six""!
Some of the important features that Terran Shield brings to the table:

 A Time Units based central mechanic to sustain a multitude of gameplay actions that can be executed in any order, for a rich and complex gameplay;

 Here is the playthrough of our alpha demo on Superhuman difficulty level, with live commentary and explanations. We wanted it to be a loss-free mission, but this time the aliens got Melnikoff with their terrific sonic gun.

Terran Shield playthrough on Superhuman (Alpha demo )The aliens will take no prisoners and will fight to the last one. They are faster, with more Time Units, more Stamina and they have a 320 degree arch vision due to their laterally placed eyes. They see better in this jungle environment than us and it is likely they will spot us well before we spot them.In addition, they are equipped with the powerful Sonic Gun that is extremely precise at any range and has a tremendous destructive power. Also watch out for the mighty alien superblaster grenade, with a smaller explosive range than ours, but with more firepower and longer throw range.Last but not least: do not hastily engage on higher difficulty levels from the beginning. Without a proper expertise and experience on the tactical battlefield, you will find the combat frustrating and impossible to win.Terran Shield long trailer The most important part of Terran Shield is its strategy core component. We are striving to provide the best in the game’s other areas (graphics, sound, effects and animation), but strategy and tactics shall remain our main focus. Time UnitsThe other core goal of our philosophy is to provide the player with the freedom to express themselves within the game: the freedom to play according to their own unique style and not get penalized by the game as a result of that. One of the main features a TBS can employ to achieve this are the Time Units.The player is aided to better manage the soldier time units by the moving area graphic representation. Inside the blue area he can move and shoot, in the green area he can move and use the item in the other hand (throw a grenade, in this case) and in the red area he can only move and change stance to get better cover during the alien turn. Damage typesAnother feature that adds more depth to the strategy and tactical areas are the damage types. There are seven types of damage for the tactical combat (Battlescape) and three types of damage (kinetic/explosive, electric, sonic) for the Geoscape battles. StancesAnother feature that takes benefit from the time units game mechanics are the stances that the soldier can have during combat. All the stances have their benefits and drawbacks. For the Air Force soldiers, the crouch and prone stances improve the aim, decreasing the chance to be hit by the aliens at the same time, but they lower the movement speed of the unit making the soldier vulnerable to enemy reaction fire.The aim of the soldier is enhanced by 7% if going into crouch stance. That change of stance uses 7 time units, but gives the soldier just enough accuracy to hit the target.The aquanauts have their stances, too: normal swim, fast swim mode and the additional shooting with medium and great support. The last two are available when the aquanaut finds something solid to grip himself onto, in order to avoid being snaked by underwater currents and miss the shoot.Geoscape and base buildingThe Geoscape is the game level where the player can construct bases, intercept hostile alien crafts, launch missions, harass alien harvesting sites and bases. It will have all the old features of the ‘90s old and loved TBS games, plus some of the new features that we have in mind for our game.The Squid detecting an alien base and targeting an alien medium fighter.Building the environment and the destructible assetsThe environment possesses resistances to certain damage, as well as vulnerabilities. The player will need to take this into account when attacking or hiding behind environment objects. The environment shall be fully destructible, but certain objects like rocks can be destroyed only with heavy artillery fire or explosives.Our current tactical map terrain is a fixed layer over which the map generator lays several types of destructible assets, foliage and fauna. Having various heights on the terrain makes the random module placement very difficult to design because the edges of the modules won’t match perfectly. For the creation of a real generated terrain from modules we need additional financial resources. Until then, the current setup can make several different maps for the same landscape map, because the assets that lay over it are very diverse. For instance, on the same structure map, we can have in the same place rocks, or a building, or a forest.More about the game can be found here.The AIHaving Razvan Florian, one of the lead scientists on neural networks in our team will also aid us in this difficult endeavour. Because an AI of the complexity we need typically runs on very powerful servers, we must pack it and make it work on a usual PC, which is not an easy task.More about the AI can be found here. The story begins around the year 2035, with a rich treasure hunter named Rick Stenk and his wife Tina, who are searching for a lost artifact called “The Gift of Poseidon”. After months of no tangible results and with the aid of the psychic medium Ana Velkova, they finally manage to find the location of the precious artifact in a submerged cave near Crete.After the discovery of the Poseidon Cave, Rick receives a phone call from his brother Eugene about a strange underwater footage in the Black Sea. On it, some unusual creatures resembling frogs can be observed, clearly intelligent, working around some underwater optic cables (the cables were ours, obviously). As nobody has a better diving team, Rick is asked to help the ongoing on-site investigation, as soon as possible.More about the story can be found here. The aliens appear to be perfectly adapted to both land and water environment, which leads us to believe that their strategy is to first invade the marine depths so that later they can surface and conquer the landmasses.Ka-Um-LaUsually, the first alien encountered by Terran Shield forces in the game, named The Frogman by the aquanauts due to its appearance, the Ka-Um-La is anatomically closely related to lizards. Well adapted to an underwater environment, it uses its strong tail to swim fast and to suddenly change direction.Its large eyes enable it to see very well in limited lighting conditions and the electro-sensors provide the ability to orientate in muddy waters. On its toes the Ka-Um-La has gecko-like pads, which can be used to climb vertical walls, thus making it a formidable foe in urban areas.Jellyfish SentryThis strange creature, named the Jellyfish Sentry by the aquanauts, is a gelatinous invertebrate that has received several unknown device implants at the hand of its alien overlords.Due to its bioluminescent bacteria pouch, which can be used as a beacon, we can assume that this creature is used as a scout, uncovering the terrain and dangers that lie ahead of the alien assault units. Being a transparent creature makes it very difficult to detect in an underwater environment. The weak electrical signals it generates make it nearly invisible to the aquanauts' sensors and therefore extra effort is required to locate this perfect alien spy.Ud'GleeRipper, killer, monster.The incarnation of all the horrors lurking and hiding in the dark depths of the oceans.The large eyes and the small fluorescent lure on its forehead are indicative of a creature that is very well adapted to the dark ocean depths. It comes as no surprise that the 6 alien rulers have assigned the sonic gun to this monster, given that its vision and perception area in an aquatic environment are unparalleled. If the aliens have more specimens of this living horror in their army, then it seems that we have already lost control over the Earth’s oceans! The only way for us to regain it and have a chance to stop the alien invasion is to capture and research one of those sonic guns, the weapon this monster handles with ease. But that is easier said than done…More about the aliens can be found here.Alien weaponsDesigning the alien weapons was not an easy task. They must be designed and manufactured underwater by the alien scientists, so we had to invent a totally new manufacturing process. Also, they have to work in the air as well as underwater and they should be produced in large numbers in a short time.The Gel GunThe gel gun is designed to isolate the enemies by forcing them to avoid the areas covered in the weapon`s gel and thus forcing them to reveal their position.The weapon can also be used to capture enemies that have had the misfortune of becoming trapped in the gel. The cartridge launched by the gel gun is propelled only a relatively short distance by means of a chemical reaction in the weapon. Once the cartridge slows down, it opens up and releases a powder which, when in contact with the surrounding water transforms into a sticky gel, forming a compact, irregular mass of approximately 6 meters in diameter. Any creature that becomes trapped in the gel will find it very difficult to become unstuck, as the gel acts like a spider web.Sonic GunUnsurprisingly, the sonic gun is the main assault weapon used by the alien forces. The technology behind this artifact is incredible. Human researchers have admitted that even though they have a partial understanding of how the weapon works, they have no theory that can explain the existence of an energy pulse that can maintain the amplified sonic waves and only release them when coming into contact with a solid surface. The nature of the type of energy capable of moving at the speed of sound, while encapsulating the sound waves produced by the weapon, is entirely unknown to humans.  The SquidDuring the whole game, the main and most powerful Terran Shield ship and transport will be the Squid. The Gods’ gift for humanity is no ordinary ship. It can evolve in time and as the players progress in the game, its super-powerful batteries are charging to their full potential unlocking new offensive and defensive abilities.The Squid can be upgraded from its initial hiding place, the Poseidon Cave, where the scientists can find hints on how to unlock its powers. The Squid research branch will be very important in late game where the ship will have to compete with the enormous dreadnoughts of the aliens, with big shields and big guns.More about the weapons can be found here. Terran Shield AquabaseThe aquabases are constructed in underwater caves or, more frequently, directly on the bottom of the ocean floor.  On this particular base iteration, maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to put the war module near the alien containment module. Should one of them escape, it could break havoc on our aquabase.They are made from a few types of base modules and can host only 2 or 3 aquanaut teams. They can have alien containment modules, sub pens, sonars, living facilities, but no manufacturing of research facility. The main reason for that is that the underwater bases are filled with water, thus restricting those kinds of facilities.The AquanautThe aquanauts have had gills implanted and their lungs have been modified with a special film that can collect the oxygen from the water and deliver it to the alveoli. In addition, their eyes were modified with a supplementary reflective area in their back, so that they can see 3 times better in low light environments than a normal human.More about the Aquanaut and his equipment.  The Air Force soldiers and tactical battlesWith his initial light armour and equipped with kinetic and electric weapons, the Terran Shield Air Force usual soldier can seem an easy target for alien forces that do so well in dense forests and humid environments. But this is a mistake, for all Terran Shield Air Force soldiers are experienced and well-trained professionals from all around the world, are resilient and have a lot of combat experience.The good thing about the electric gun is that it can function under- and above water.Another factor in favour of the Air Force is that the troop transport hovercraft can bring to the battle line up to 30 fully equipped soldiers, plus additional battle robots, drones and also small artillery pieces. In fact, they have enough firepower to destroy all the hunting aliens on the tactical map. Tall and slim, the It-Um-La can sneak behind enemy lines and use a melee weapon or can launch an unexpected mortar barrage on enemy positions. Some of the melee aliens that the Terran Shield forces will encounter. Well... nobody wants to get near those.​ The splitting of the Jellyfish Sentry.​ The modified Sonic Gun below is the favourite weapon of this monster. We wonder what is its favourite food...​ The Shark attack drone helicopter. Very fast, small target for the enemy, cheap and with decent firepower. Terran Shield medivac is the fastest troops transport vehicle for small forces. It can deploy troops in difficult terrain and offer high medical assistance and recovery. ""The Defender"" Hovercraft ""The Defender"" Hovercraft - exterior​ Vehicles and soldiers placement inside ""The Defender"" Hovercraft​ Air Force vehicles and drones.​ The first concept for the Terran Shield Air Force soldier with advanced combat armor made with alien technology. Terran Shield land base placed at the sea shore, with underwater heavy defenses and several heavy armored docks.  Not only humans are looking for lost treasures.      We are a fresh Romanian indie game company that enjoys making special games to challenge the players while giving them a polished game-play and great replayability.At the same time, we want to remain in touch with the game community, talk to our fans about our games and adjust them if necessary. Game development schedule Risks and challengesAs with every game project, there is a risk that the end product will not be delivered as promised, or that the project will be cancelled. For strategy games in particular, the main risk is that the final game is unbalanced, as it happened before to other TBS games. In order to avoid this scenario for Terran Shield, we have established the balance between the strategy and tactical components of the game as our number one priority. Even if we run short of funds, we won’t deliver the final product until it is well-balanced and fun to play. We would rather have fewer environments and assets than provide an unfinished strategy game.",76.0,1,"1 Campaign

The Aiprahs had their folly erased. </p><p>Lyaloto however, suffered deeply with the death of many Michs, and realized that, they could not live in Misadventure without the ability to combat. It was when Lyaloto cut off one of his wings, relinquishing half of his power, and delivered it to the most valiant Michs, who turned the wing into a spiritual source of Mich's existence. </p><p>Lyaloto could no longer defeat Oto after that, but the Michs possessed the power of a true god in their hands. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>WOOAH</p><p> </p><p>If you've read this far, thank you!

The Aiprahs had their folly erased. Lyaloto however, suffered deeply with the death of many Michs, and realized that, they could not live in Misadventure without the ability to combat. It was when Lyaloto cut off one of his wings, relinquishing half of his power, and delivered it to the most valiant Michs, who turned the wing into a spiritual source of Mich's existence. Lyaloto could no longer defeat Oto after that, but the Michs possessed the power of a true god in their hands.   WOOAH If you've read this far, thank you!

<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;font-weight: normal;"">""Over the Pit"" is a challenging pirate-themed game where you have a crew of 3 different pirates who stand on a platform that barely balances on a high thin pole. You control them by left-clicking anywhere on the platform, but can only control one pirate a time. To control others, you'll need to switch them with Q and E keys.</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;font-weight: normal;"">What are they doing there? Stealing stuff for you, of course! Every several seconds a random amount of different items falls down on the platform and your goal is to collect them by pressing the SPACE key. When you do it, all items that are currently on the platform, instantly disappear and add score points for each collected item. ""Collect"" ability has its colldown so you shouldn't try to spam it. </span></h3>

It is important to keep their patience high by stealing items, otherwise when it goes down to zero you lose the game. Patience is decreasing slowly by default and instantly drops every time an item gets lost (falls off the platform). Once you collect items, however, the Patience bar is fully restored.</span>
</div>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;font-weight: normal;"">The amount of achieved score through stealing items depends on the amount and weight of items you collect - the more is the better.

<h1>Funding Goals</h1>
<div>I won't lie, these money are needed mostly for keeping up the developement of the game (this includes food, purchasing equipment for making audio, hiring an artist to help with game design and etc.), but also as a motivation for improvements that are planned for the game. Every goal achieved during this campaign gives the priority to a certain feature.</div>
<h3>$500. More Pirates!</h3>
<div>The range of available pirates won't stop on 6, of course, and there are at least 3-4 ideas for more pirates and one of them is already drawn! So when we achieve th3e amount of more than $500 these pirates will appear in the game!</div>
<h3>$1200. Drawing Livestream!</h3>
<div>Once this goal is reached, there'll be a public YouTube livestream with real-time digital drawing of a wallpaper featuring one of the available pirates (chosen by your voting beforehand) with a following giveaway of the said wallpaper.</div>
<div>
<h3>$2000. Wallpapers and Trivia!</h3>
<div>Every pirate in ""Over the Pit"" has his own story. You can help them to appear in the final product along with full-screen wallpapers featuring each of the pirates. Supportrers of the project will also be able to recieve a digital archive with all of the wallpapers.</div>
</div>
<div>Also if you'd like the Drawing Livestream, these wallpapers would be drawn during livestreams too (without giveaways, however, to be fair with the supporters).</div>
<h3>$3400. Challenges!</h3>
<div>What is a game without actual quests and challenges? If we reach the goal of 3000 dollars, a system of Challenges will be implemented, where players are put to different tasks, such as:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<i>""don't use any special ability for 10 seconds"" </i><br/>
</li>
<li>
<i>""Get 2 Golden Anchors in a row (by collecting more than 15 items with the current Golden Anchor on the platform)"" </i><br/>
</li>
<li>
<i>""Reach 1000 score without losing dropping a single item off the platform""</i> and etc.<br/>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div>The system of Challenges works the next way: you are given an opportunity to recieve up to 3 random challenges(without knowing wich)  before you start picking your pirates for the game. When you choose to recieve a challenge, it's automatically accepted but it's not an obligation to have all three of them accepted. You can easily play with 1 or 2 challenge, or without them. These challenges are kept with you during the game and once you finish it (by Patience or falling off the platform) you recieve reward for completing the challenges.</div>
<div>The reward points are then used to unlock different pirate skins, surroundings, wallpapers and trivia.</div>
<h3>$3500. Extra Content!</h3>
<div>The final goal of the campaign will add more skins for pirates, the platform, surroundings and other things that you can unlock by completing challenges. There'll also be a pack of exclusive pirate skins for all of the supporters of the project.</div>

</div></div>","What is ""Over The Pit""?
""Over the Pit"" is a challenging pirate-themed game where you have a crew of 3 different pirates who stand on a platform that barely balances on a high thin pole.

When you do it, all items that are currently on the platform, instantly disappear and add score points for each collected item. ""Collect"" ability has its colldown so you shouldn't try to spam it. 

Another important feature is the Patience bar that shows wether your crew is fine about doing their job or they are going to quit. It is important to keep their patience high by stealing items, otherwise when it goes down to zero you lose the game. Patience is decreasing slowly by default and instantly drops every time an item gets lost (falls off the platform). Once you collect items, however, the Patience bar is fully restored.

The amount of achieved score through stealing items depends on the amount and weight of items you collect - the more is the better. Also, the amount of items you get at once has different names and effects on the game process:



Poor Swag: Less than 6 items. No score reward + 1 skull;

Swaggy Swag: From 10 to 15 items. Score reward + Minor bonus score + 2 coins;

Swagganeer: More than 15 items. Score reward + Major bonus score + 3 coins.

Key elements here are skulls and coins. Every time you collect items you get one of those and the game counts them. Once you get 3 skulls or 3 coins, they transform into a special item that instantly falls on the platform:


3 skulls turn into a Black Spot. The Black Spot stops you from collecting items unless you find a way to drop it off the platform. It's extremely important to get rid of it ASAP.


3 coins turn into a Golden Anchor. With the Golden Anchor, the next time you collect items you get twice the amount of score reward for them. Golden Anchor, however, is collected too so it's a single-use bonus.



  To sum up, the goal of the game is to reach higher score while:



not letting any of your pirates fall off the platform;


not letting them to run out of Patience.

I've been studying psychology and business here for the last 4 years and am months from graduating.</p><p><br/></p><p>In all my 4 1/2 years of schooling and 3 years of delivering pizzas to every party, study session, and general gathering in Statesboro I've learned three things (outside of my fields of study): Everyone loves to play video games, every gamer has some kind of nostalgia from games they grew up with, and everyone is the best at whatever game they play (somehow). </p><p><br/></p><p>After months of meeting with every loan officer and branch manager in town, they've all come to one conclusion: ""It's a good idea, we think it will work, BUT you're going to need assets or cash of your own because we can't give you the whole thing."" - <b>This is where you come in:</b> </p><p><br/></p><p>By helping me reach this goal we'll receive a new store in Statesboro to provide games from Super Nintendo/Dreamcast or a Playstation3/xbox360 and anything in between. Besides a store we'll also get a place where all the gamers of Statesboro can come play to prove they really are the best (There can be only one!), and not just video games: Spades, Checkers, Chess, if it's a game and you're good at it then we'll gladly try to crown you the King/Queen of Statesboro at it. Some tournaments will be for free, but some will allow you to win money or other prizes (and they said your gaming would never amount to anything). </p><p><b>Most importantly: you'll have a discount handy for when the next great video games come out, </b>and having a competing store lowers prices by breaking the monopoly of Gamestop. Just think, <b>giving a dollar (or more) today could save you so much more over time, and possibly earn you more money on your trade-ins.</b></p><p><b>With those benefits to your gaming career and your wallet, how could you not afford to donate/share? </b></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>The bank wants me to put up 20% of the amount they give me as collateral. <b>5K is the minimum to open, but 10K is the true target amount</b> because with that I can get funding for new games, old games, retro games, and the equipment to host the tournaments and run and advertise what will be a successful store/venue.  </p><p><b>Here's what can happen at different levels:</b></p><p><b>&lt;5K</b>: Game Over. IndieGogo will refund your money, and we'll be distant friends for life because you believed in me enough to try and help me out.</p><p><b>5K</b>: We now have a store, filled with retro games to modern games, and a few consoles to play them on.</p><p><b>7K</b>: Modern consoles, brand new games, and likely Ps4/Xbox1 games. Spade Tournaments and other card and board games will be held, any video game tournaments would be retro. </p><p><b>8K: </b>major items, like a console or a new popular game can be reserved/bought online, that way you wont even have to leave the house without knowing if your game will be in stock.</p><p><b>9K</b>: We'll try to get some kind of customer loyalty program going.</p><p><b>10K</b>: You've won, we can now play video game tournaments (Madden, Nba, Mortal Kombat), and there will be a wall of fame as well as grand tournaments where the winners from past tournaments have a chance to be the best of the best.</p><p><b>&gt;10K</b>: more games for tournaments (Fifa, boxing, baseball, ect), larger selections, and possibly form a league, maybe even have a lounge to meet other gamers.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Anyone who wants anything to do in Statesboro has three options: Drink, see a movie, or go bowling. All of these things last an hour or two but get stale after a while, every Spades game starts with three people wanting to play and trying to find a fourth person, and finding people to play online who won't quit as soon as you start winning can be a chore. Gamer's Palace will be a place to fix all of that, where people who enjoy video games can come together, and where games of the past won't be lost forever.</p><p>And having a competing store <b>lowers prices</b> by breaking the monopoly of Gamestop. Just think, <b>giving a dollar (</b>or more<b>) today could save you so much more over time, </b>and possibly earn you more money on your trade-ins.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Even if you can't contribute money (It's hard out there):</p><p></p><ol>

I've been studying psychology and business here for the last 4 years and am months from graduating.In all my 4 1/2 years of schooling and 3 years of delivering pizzas to every party, study session, and general gathering in Statesboro I've learned three things (outside of my fields of study): Everyone loves to play video games, every gamer has some kind of nostalgia from games they grew up with, and everyone is the best at whatever game they play (somehow). After months of meeting with every loan officer and branch manager in town, they've all come to one conclusion: ""It's a good idea, we think it will work, BUT you're going to need assets or cash of your own because we can't give you the whole thing."" - This is where you come in: By helping me reach this goal we'll receive a new store in Statesboro to provide games from Super Nintendo/Dreamcast or a Playstation3/xbox360 and anything in between. Besides a store we'll also get a place where all the gamers of Statesboro can come play to prove they really are the best (There can be only one!), and not just video games: Spades, Checkers, Chess, if it's a game and you're good at it then we'll gladly try to crown you the King/Queen of Statesboro at it. Some tournaments will be for free, but some will allow you to win money or other prizes (and they said your gaming would never amount to anything). Most importantly: you'll have a discount handy for when the next great video games come out, and having a competing store lowers prices by breaking the monopoly of Gamestop. Just think, giving a dollar (or more) today could save you so much more over time, and possibly earn you more money on your trade-ins.With those benefits to your gaming career and your wallet, how could you not afford to donate/share? What We Need & What You GetThe bank wants me to put up 20% of the amount they give me as collateral. 5K is the minimum to open, but 10K is the true target amount because with that I can get funding for new games, old games, retro games, and the equipment to host the tournaments and run and advertise what will be a successful store/venue.  Here's what can happen at different levels:<5K: Game Over. IndieGogo will refund your money, and we'll be distant friends for life because you believed in me enough to try and help me out.5K: We now have a store, filled with retro games to modern games, and a few consoles to play them on.7K: Modern consoles, brand new games, and likely Ps4/Xbox1 games. Spade Tournaments and other card and board games will be held, any video game tournaments would be retro. 8K: major items, like a console or a new popular game can be reserved/bought online, that way you wont even have to leave the house without knowing if your game will be in stock.9K: We'll try to get some kind of customer loyalty program going.10K: You've won, we can now play video game tournaments (Madden, Nba, Mortal Kombat), and there will be a wall of fame as well as grand tournaments where the winners from past tournaments have a chance to be the best of the best.>10K: more games for tournaments (Fifa, boxing, baseball, ect), larger selections, and possibly form a league, maybe even have a lounge to meet other gamers.The ImpactAnyone who wants anything to do in Statesboro has three options: Drink, see a movie, or go bowling. All of these things last an hour or two but get stale after a while, every Spades game starts with three people wanting to play and trying to find a fourth person, and finding people to play online who won't quit as soon as you start winning can be a chore. Gamer's Palace will be a place to fix all of that, where people who enjoy video games can come together, and where games of the past won't be lost forever.And having a competing store lowers prices by breaking the monopoly of Gamestop. Just think, giving a dollar (or more) today could save you so much more over time, and possibly earn you more money on your trade-ins.Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you can't contribute money (It's hard out there):

Tell a friend, especially if all you ever see them do is play video games. 


Tell your nephew, he never takes his eyes off the TV anyway and this will get him out of the house.


Ladies, tell your boyfriend, let him sit on our couch and play instead of yours so that you can watch your shows and have some peace


Fellas, tell your girlfriend because she wants to see you happy.


Parents, tell your co-workers, get your kids in here winning prizes and money so they don't have to spend yours.


Everyone else: tell someone, and then after they contribute be sure to invite them so you can beat them (it's only fair).

But even the smell of smoke is dulled by the smell of perfumed men and women. And by wine, warmed and sweetened. The walls covered in tapestries displaying acts of heroism, during days long past. The last of this ancient family is gone, and soon their remaining supplies, rescued from Goblin murderers, will be used up.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"">Greater than the smells, a cacophony of noise fills the hall to it's breaking point. I see senators and captains, who took their small pieces of the imperial forces away from the boarders so that their own homes could be guarded. I see the Magi of Belgraven argue about the nature of their power, while dark magic seeps into our world. I see the High Priests of my beloved church demand their place of power, while demons and worse claim the souls of our people. I see greedy merchants, who horde their gold and buy stolen treasures from our invaders. This room of the selfish, the greedy, the petty, and the pompous, this is where all our hope lies.</p>

<p>Rack and Ruin is deisgned to be a game where players can take a small number of miniatures, from whatever company, and use them.  More than that, customize them and create them as the player feels they should be.</p>

<p>But not every miniature in your party has to be a hero.  Our creature trait system allow you to take a monster you have and put it in the game.  Giants, trolls, dragons, treemen, triceratops, wolves, King Kong, horses, hydras and some 5"" infernal bug-thing have all been written up and used on the table with our rules.</p>

<p>We are undertaking this crowd funding project in order to add the final touches we need to publish Rack and Ruin. First of all we will be adding more art work for the interior and getting a professional layout done. Perhaps more important we plan to have a suitably impressive cover for this game we have put so much work into. Finally, we will be using what's left to have the game printed.</p>

<div>
<p>Rack and Ruin is a game originally designed to combine role-playing and miniatures games into one customisable table top skirmish system. Each player selects miniatures they wish to use, beginning with four ""hero"" miniatures. Each hero is then built; much like one would create a pen and paper RPG character, with skills, traits, races, and items.</p>
<p>Traits are perhaps the most defining aspect of a character. They determine if a hero has followers, can wield magic, fills a specific role within a party, or has special abilities.</p>
<p>Followers can be characters of lesser ability than the heroes or monsters designed by the player to reflect his or her miniatures.</p>
<p>Once parties are created 2-4 players can join in a single game. Players select terrain, roll for scenario and the time of day the game is being played in. That combination will make almost every game completely unique.</p>
<p>In game, players will attempt to gather as many victory points as possible, the player with the most victory points at end of the game wins that game. Victory points also determine the amount of experience points each of the player's heroes will get for being fielded. Winning a game gives you bonus experience, as does playing against parties more powerful than your own.</p>
<p>Winning games, amassing treasure, and a few other factors give a party legacy. Legacy is the ultimate factor in determining who wins a campaign.</p>
<p>After a game, players check to see what treasures they have collected, if their party members took any permanent injuries and check to see if any of their heroes have gained enough experience to ascend to the next level learning more skills and traits. Then each party member may take a single out of game action. Out of game actions are often precious, so using them wisely is important.</p>

<p><strong>Bizarre Bazaar Mini-Expansion</strong> - The Bizarre Bazaar sells some of the strangest items ever to be seen in the known world. And whether sinner or saint, crusader or corrupter, builder or destroyer, the hawkers there will happily show you their wares. But while the merchants seem happy to take a price in gold, the true cost might be more than even brave adventurers can pay. Bizarre Bazaar will be a mini-expansion of approximately 10 pages that will feature the ""Visit the Bazaar"" out-of-game action and 50 new items.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal;""><strong>Rumbling Bellies Mini-Expansion</strong> - Ogres have returned, and they have returned hungry. Savvy captains can see the value of employing these hulking brutes. Especially, when all they require is food enough to fill their massive appetites. If a captain can provide enough snacks and supplies to keep an Ogre content perhaps they will have power enough to force their will upon the world. Rumbling Bellies, formerly know as Going Clubbing, will be a mini-expansion of approximately 10 pages that will feature new rules for snacks, new traits involving snacks and supplies, and the new Ogre character race.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><strong>Familiars Mini-Expansion</strong> - Familiars are thaumatergical (magic eating) animal spirits that serve a spell caster in exchange for feeding off the power of the magic their master creates. There are many different types of familiars that take any number of shapes. While familiars give the spell caster boons there are also drawbacks to using these always hungry magical beasts. Familiars will be a mini-expansion of approximately 10 pages that will introduce rules for using familiars and 20 familiars to share the stage with all of your parties spell casters.</p>

The doubt washes over me and I waver. Behind me my last loyal followers sense my trepidation. Sir Ulric, ever unflinching, places a mailed hand upon my shoulder. “We stand with you.” His assurance is enough for me to look back to the squabbling mob.
“My good Lords and Ladies!” Calls out the herald, “The floor will now be given to the honourable Destrian Lord, Fendrel Hillgarret.”
At the mention of my name, Brother Benedict speaks a whispered prayer to five of the 10,000 Heroes of the Vanguard. It is enough, my doubt gone, I hand my personal banner to the towering Sir Gavin, and walk up the steps.

But not every miniature in your party has to be a hero.  Our creature trait system allow you to take a monster you have and put it in the game.  Giants, trolls, dragons, treemen, triceratops, wolves, King Kong, horses, hydras and some 5"" infernal bug-thing have all been written up and used on the table with our rules.
We've been playing Rack and Ruin locally for some time, but now we want to take it to the next leve and we want you to be a part of it.


We are undertaking this crowd funding project in order to add the final touches we need to publish Rack and Ruin. First of all we will be adding more art work for the interior and getting a professional layout done. Perhaps more important we plan to have a suitably impressive cover for this game we have put so much work into. Finally, we will be using what's left to have the game printed.
The Beta Test rules are now available here for those interested in trying out the game, though we still encourage you to sign-up for the beta test emails on our Facebook page.

Rack and Ruin is a game originally designed to combine role-playing and miniatures games into one customisable table top skirmish system. Each player selects miniatures they wish to use, beginning with four ""hero"" miniatures. Each hero is then built; much like one would create a pen and paper RPG character, with skills, traits, races, and items.
Traits are perhaps the most defining aspect of a character. They determine if a hero has followers, can wield magic, fills a specific role within a party, or has special abilities.
Followers can be characters of lesser ability than the heroes or monsters designed by the player to reflect his or her miniatures.
Once parties are created 2-4 players can join in a single game. Players select terrain, roll for scenario and the time of day the game is being played in. That combination will make almost every game completely unique.
In game, players will attempt to gather as many victory points as possible, the player with the most victory points at end of the game wins that game. Victory points also determine the amount of experience points each of the player's heroes will get for being fielded. Winning a game gives you bonus experience, as does playing against parties more powerful than your own.
Winning games, amassing treasure, and a few other factors give a party legacy. Legacy is the ultimate factor in determining who wins a campaign.
After a game, players check to see what treasures they have collected, if their party members took any permanent injuries and check to see if any of their heroes have gained enough experience to ascend to the next level learning more skills and traits. Then each party member may take a single out of game action. Out of game actions are often precious, so using them wisely is important.

In the core rules players can customize the rules for their miniatures using:

8 Scenarios
72 Magic Spells
Rules for 25 terrain pieces
27 actions a miniature can take in game, plus 7 quick actions
45 Follower traits and weaknesses so that players can design their own creatures

The Rack and Ruin core rules also contain:

18 Skills
8 Character races, of which 6 may select from 5 specific traits for their race (Beastmen and Humans work a little differently)
68 Traits
60 Items
20 Out of game actions




When  you make a pledge to receive any perk with a ""Thank  You"" you will be recognized on the Crowd Funding Support Page of the Rack and Ruin Core Rule Book. You will be recognized based on the perk that you pledged for, starting with Thank You pledges being recognized under the main Thank You section, all three follower pledges being recognized as Followers up to anyone that pledges the Emperor perk being recognized as Emperor.
The Rack and Ruin Core Rule Book will be approximately 200 pages. The printed versions will be perfect bound soft cover copies with full colour covers and black and white interior pages. It will feature art from Thunder Bay area artists and give you all the rules you need to take your favourite minitaures to the Rack and Ruin gaming table.
Bizarre Bazaar Mini-Expansion - The Bizarre Bazaar sells some of the strangest items ever to be seen in the known world. And whether sinner or saint, crusader or corrupter, builder or destroyer, the hawkers there will happily show you their wares. But while the merchants seem happy to take a price in gold, the true cost might be more than even brave adventurers can pay. Bizarre Bazaar will be a mini-expansion of approximately 10 pages that will feature the ""Visit the Bazaar"" out-of-game action and 50 new items.
Rumbling Bellies Mini-Expansion - Ogres have returned, and they have returned hungry. Savvy captains can see the value of employing these hulking brutes. Especially, when all they require is food enough to fill their massive appetites. If a captain can provide enough snacks and supplies to keep an Ogre content perhaps they will have power enough to force their will upon the world. Rumbling Bellies, formerly know as Going Clubbing, will be a mini-expansion of approximately 10 pages that will feature new rules for snacks, new traits involving snacks and supplies, and the new Ogre character race.
Familiars Mini-Expansion - Familiars are thaumatergical (magic eating) animal spirits that serve a spell caster in exchange for feeding off the power of the magic their master creates. There are many different types of familiars that take any number of shapes. While familiars give the spell caster boons there are also drawbacks to using these always hungry magical beasts. Familiars will be a mini-expansion of approximately 10 pages that will introduce rules for using familiars and 20 familiars to share the stage with all of your parties spell casters.

<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">Netherworld is an abstract exploration rogue-like game with tactical combat encounters, which takes place in a dreamy, ethereal space called the Netherworld. The procedurally generated universe makes sure that no two situations are ever the same, and the robust mechanics always invite you to come up with your own smart and creative solutions. For starters, construct your own custom spellpowers with the open-ended custom spell creation system!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/59488139/netherworld/IGG/headers/header_netherworld.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">Your exploration quest will take place in an abstract and otherworldly space called the Netherworld, where you can actually encounter places such as an Essence Vortex, a Crystalline Dreamweaver, or a Rich Viridian Cloud. We aim to create an ambience that will be at the same time mysterious, so that you will always want to explore the universe beyond the horizon, and sublime and ornamental in detail, so that you can have a relaxed and meditative aesthetic experience.</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">In its heart, Netherworld is an exploration game and plays around the most classic RPG core loop that we all love: You need to overcome obstacles, so that you can reach more resources, which increase your power, and allow you to overcome even more difficult obstacles and explore even deeper into the universe. There are several ways how you can win – you will need to either beat the ultimate combat encounter, activate all the beacons that are scattered in the world, or enact a unique ritual that requires several rare and exotic components.</p>

<p style=""clear: both; height: 0;""> </p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">You will encounter many different locations in your exploration, each with its own particular way to either help or block you on your way to victory. Some locations will provide you with more resources, while others will allow you to boost a particular statistic, or to construct a new spellpower. Some more malicious locations will try to block your exploration ambitions: these will be mostly tactical combat encounters, but could also be monumental wardens that will not let you pass until you activate certain beacons somewhere else, barriers that will open only when you have transmuted a certain crystal or a certain dust, and so on.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">While some locations offer you immediate rewards, others provide you with an opportunity that you may choose to return to later, when the circumstances have changed and you possess the necessary resources, or when it turns out that you unexpectedly require their services.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">For example, these are some of the locations that you can encounter:</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Essence Vortex: </strong>You can spend some Essence to harmonise the vortex, which will make it provide you with a little Essence whenever you win in a battle. Essence is the most universal resource you have, and to harmonise a vortex is basically an investment.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Attentive/Observant/Sleepless/Wary Sentinel: </strong>The Sentinel will not let you pass, at least not until you learn its secret – which may be located somewhere else in the universe, maybe?</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Chromatic Catalyst:</strong> You can use the Chromatic Catalyst to transmute your elementary dusts into more potent, composite dusts. For example, you can transmute Crimson Ashes, Scarlet Powder and Vermilion Cinders to create the Garnet Dust, and so on. You always exhaust the Catalyst a little when you use it, up until the point where you cannot use it anymore, and have to locate another one.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Azure/Carmine/Brass Transmuter: </strong>Transmuters allow you to transmute basic dusts that you have an abundance of into other basic dusts that you perhaps need more importantly at the moment. However, every Transmuter only works with the dusts of a particular color: Azure with blue, Carmine with red, and Brass with yellow.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Oscillator: </strong>You have two options how to calibrate the Oscillator – either to an Equilibrium Oscillator, which increases your Stability, or to a Considerance Oscillator, which boosts your Spirit. The Oscillators provide you with a more substantial bonus when you calibrate more of them in the same way, so you have to balance between a more substantial bonus to one statistic, or a less substantial one to both.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Transcendental Monument:</strong> The Monument allows you to learn a new vocation. Unlike at the Archway, where you can only learn the one vocation that is available at that Archway, the Monument allows you to choose which vocation you want to pick up. However, it costs you more Experience to unlock a vocation at the Monument than what it would cost at the Archway.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Crystalline Dreamweaver: </strong>You can spend Essence to unlock an additional spellpower slot that you can load up your spellpowers into while in a combat encounter.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">The robust core mechanics allow for a lot of space for many unique locations, and we absolutely want to explore this breadth, so that you can encounter new locations even when many hours down the road!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/59488139/netherworld/IGG/headers/header_encounters.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">In order to reach new locations and reap their sweet, sweet rewards, you will have to overcome many anomaly encounters, which is where Netherworld switches to its turn-based, open-ended tactical combat mode. There are several basic encounter schemes that determine what you have to achieve in order to overcome the encounter, such as Elimination, Assassination, Assault or Survival, and then there are several randomly chosen entities, each with its own particular mischievous way to try and stop you.</p>
<p><a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/59488139/netherworld/IGG/screenshots/encounter_1.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/59488139/netherworld/IGG/screenshots/encounter_1_small.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;""/></a></p>

<p style=""clear: both; height: 0;""> </p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">Every entity has a very simple action that it takes whenever you cast any ability: Noises will reduce your Stability, Spectres will drain your Spirit, while Abominations will countdown until they explode and hurt you real bad. Some entities, such as Wards, may raise barriers around or directly heal other entities, while Constructors spawn more entities until you stop them. And you better be ready when you meet the Nemesis, because, well, it doesn't like you.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">The important part is that while the all the entities by themselves are usually really straightforward in what they do, it's their random selection system that creates an enormous possibility space of how many scenarios you can potentially encounter, each with its own very distinct dynamic. When you have an Abomination cluster that will blow your Stability away in ten turns time, a Noise Constructor that continuously spawns new Noises which reduce your Stability every turn, and a Spectre line-up which, in the meantime, drains your Spirit that you need to cast your spellpowers every turn – what do you do?</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">The most important decision that you have to make in a battle is what spellpowers you choose to load up into your spellpower slots. You can choose which spellpowers you want to load up into your ability slots whenever you want, but once you pick a spellpower into a slot, that is indeed what spellpower you will have in that slot for the entire battle! Your power selection will have primordial impact on how well you will probably do in the battle, because based on what entities are on the screen, and what do you need to achieve, some abilities will be pretty much exactly what you need, while others may simply make no sense. What makes or breaks your success is always how well can you understand the situation that you are in, and choose an appropriate toolset that will help you effectively achieve what you need to do.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">TL;DR: You can leave your leet minmax Excel skills at home this time, because it is time to show some actual smart play!</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">'So, what is this that I hear about that I can construct my own spells? I have always wanted to do that!', I hear you say. I know! I have always wanted to construct my own spells in RPGs. I usually play as a caster class when I can, and I think that the most important reason why people choose to play a spellcaster is because you want to play as this awesome person who is badass, but in a smart, sophisticated way. You want to win thanks to how you have outsmarted your opponent, how you came up with a brilliant idea in the important moment, and how you can exploit the mechanics to make them serve whatever it is that you currently need to do. Because you are an individuality, a smart phenomenon to be reckoned with. Which means that obviously, it won’t do to just dumbly repeat the same spells that everybody does! You want your own! Duh!</p>

<p style=""clear: both; height: 0;""> </p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">Well, it's true – in Netherworld, you actually have to construct all your spellpowers that you want to have available in the combat encounters to come. You can construct new spellpowers in the exploration phase, when you encounter a special location called a Monolith. Every Monolith allows you to construct one particular spellpower based around the provided central core, which determines what the power will do and its basic numbers, but which also always comes with several runeslots into which you can load up runes that may take your new spell in many dramatically different directions.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">For example, Destabilise, which is the basic offensive strike spellpower, can be constructed in such a way that it will either heal you based on the hits that it delivers (which makes it essentially a Drain Health spell), or maybe so that it will hit all the enemies in the cluster (which makes it basically an AoE), or have the Impact quality attached to it (which works as a stun), or you can even make it deliver the hits in a particular Force (so that you can make, say, a Chaotic or a Void spell).</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">The cool part is that the runeslot structure means that you can combine all these in any way you please, and thus create powers such as a chaotic stun, an AoE drain, or even a chaotic AoE drain stun (I know you want to!). However, you have to keep in mind that every component usually increases the spellpower's cooldown and/or the Spirit that you will need to cast it, or maybe have some other downside to it, such as that it can make the spell only available to be cast X times in any one battle. Which means that when you construct a new spell, you need to consider what your current stats will be able to actually make work in a battle, and what may be a little too cool for you at the moment!</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">Also, you can only use every Monolith once, and the power composition does cost some resources, so you need to think twice about how to design the power in such a way that it will work well in combination with the other abilities that you have, in the environment that you are currently in, with your attunements and traits, and so on.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/59488139/netherworld/IGG/headers/header_otherMechanics.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">While what you have read above constitutes the core mechanics in Netherworld, there are also several complementary mechanics in play. We aim to have a very robust, yet intricate and ornamental mechanics architecture, which will provide you with many opportunities to capitalise when you pay attention to detail in your decisions.</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Transmutation: </strong>In numerous Clouds, Hazes, and Mists, you can collect many peculiar dusts and powders that you can then transmute at catalysts and transmuters to create even more potent substances. You can then use these to enact various rituals at the Altars or the Immortals' Soulshards, which can provide you with many different boosts, such as to your stats or Experience, or even with some entirely unique qualities.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Crystals: </strong>You will occasionally stumble upon crystals, which may be required as a component in the most potent rituals, or can be used as a key to unlock locations that would be unreachable otherwise. When you cleanse the crystals, you will also be able to decompose them at a Quartz Disassambler to boost up your Essence reserves.</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Vocations: </strong>Vocations – such as Explorer, Invoker, Transmuter, or Curator – allow you to unlock and level up various traits related to a particular mechanic or statistic. Vocations can be unlocked with Experience, which you earn mainly when you overcome the combat encounters. </p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Pockets: </strong>Parts of the world (with some sweet rewards, of course!) will remain concealed unless you deploy some means to reveal them.

You can only have so many attunements adopted at any one time, so you will eventually need to decide which ones to drop, so that you can replace them with the cooler ones that you encounter as you explore.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">Certainly, this is not in any way an exhaustive list – we want to create a very rich and subtly interconnected mechanical system, but hopefully these should be able to make you understand the overall vision!</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">I learned to code when I was 12, and I don't think there were ever more than a couple consecutive weeks since then when I wouldn't code in some way. I have made, as a contracted work or a personal project, 2D games, 3D games, online games, office applications, websites, magazines, mods, libraries, and cash register drivers, and I have learned many lessons the hard way, but as a result I can now quite naturally do whatever it is that I need to do, and can concentrate on how to create a deeper and a more creative design. I would not present you with Netherworld if I would not be absolutely sure that I can deliver on what I promise, but I am!</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">Games have always been my passion. I earned all my teenage money writing videogame reviews, and it was only natural that I chose to pursue a technical and an artistic university course, so that I could learn about games from both the perspectives. I moved mountains to come here to London this year, so that I could pursue an MA in Digital Game Design, which I am now about to complete in about two months. </p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">I started to think about what eventually became Netherworld about two years ago now, and I have made several experimental prototypes to arrive to the current design. I am confident that I have an awesome game on my hands now, and I need your guys' help to make it happen!</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">I am a code-oriented developer much more than I am a visual artist, so what you can see in the video and in the screenshots all around here serves only to demonstrate the visual concept that I have, and how I would eventually like Netherworld to look like – I will need to hire an actual visual artist, who will be able to realise this vision with the subtlety that it needs. I do have several very talented people in mind, and I think that I should actually be able to update you with some exciting news in this aspect soon!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/59488139/netherworld/IGG/headers/header_rewards.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">Now, it is up to you to make sure that all that can actually happen! This is the make or break moment in the Netherworld development, and we really need your support now, so that we can make the concept that we believe is awesome become a well-polished reality.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">You can see that there are several levels on which you can back the development, and I would now like to explain clearly how the reward system is laid out. These are the the basics that apply to all the contribution levels:</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>The reward system is cumulative: </strong>This means that whichever level you choose to contribute on, you always automatically have access to all the previous perks as well.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Achievements: </strong>Every contribution level automatically unlocks an achievement with the same name, so that we can make other people know that you have contributed when it was the most important. This means a Steam achievement, should we launch on Steam, and certainly one in the Netherworld's achievement screen.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Forum icons: </strong>There will be a Netherworld Forum to invite discussions about Netherworld, and each contribution tier will provide you with a very special icon displayed next to all your posts while over there.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Remembrance Wall: </strong>Remembrance Wall is a boundless wall that can be opened in the main menu and which eternally commemorates and honors all the backers that have helped made the Netherworld development possible. Backers in the upper tiers always receive a certain special visual distinction or a more prominent position on the Wall than the previous tiers.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">Be sure to let us know in case that you would be interested in another way in which we could appreciate your help – we will surely work it out!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/59488139/netherworld/IGG/headers/header_rewardLocations.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">There are several special locations that are designed especially with you as the contributors in mind, so that you can leave an even more permanent mark on the Netherworld universe. Besides, we sincerely believe that these can create some brilliant crowd-sourced content, such as with the Obelisks, enable you to have your name sound unexpectedly cool, such as with the Immortals, or bestow you with some awesome and unusual meta powers, such as with the Broadcaster!</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><span>It is also important to know that since every contributor's copy will be connected to his or her backer contribution, a very special event will occur when you encounter your own Founder's Stone, or any other special location dedicated to you.</span></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Founder’s Stone: </strong>Founder’s Stone is a rather common location, which instantly increases the player’s Stability by a small amount. Every Founder’s Stone commemorates a randomly selected Netherworld backer, whose name is displayed along a short poetic text in the location description.</p>
<center><hr style=""border-color: #003366; width: 10em;""/></center>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Enlightenment Obelisk: </strong>Enlightenment Obelisk is a special location which, besides an instant boost to the players Spirit and Experience, displays an actual advice that has been supplied by a randomly selected backer with the particular perk. In other words, every Netherworld backer that has contributed at least on the necessary level can send us an actual advice that he or she wants to share with other players via the Obelisks. The advice should be about a sentence or two, and should at least remotely resonate with the overall transcendental ambience, but we promise we will be very open minded. For example, <em>'Fortune sides with him who dares'</em> is a clear OK, as is <em>'Remember that today is the yesterday’s tomorrow'</em>, but we will probably need you to convince us a little more about <em>'Don’t shit where you eat'</em>.</p>
<center><hr style=""border-color: #003399; width: 10em;""/></center>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Immortal’s Soulshard: </strong>Immortal's Soulshard is a monument that is always related to a particular Immortal, and allows the player to enact a unique, expensive, but very potent ritual specific to the particular Immortal. When you back Netherworld on the respective tier, we will work with you to create an Immortal based around your name: that means that we will translate your name to match the Immortal name style, and because every Immortal also comes with an epithet (because that is indeed how they roll), you can choose how do you want your Immortal to be known in the Netherworld lore. We will also work with you to design a unique ritual that will resonate with your created Immortal identity.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">For example, this means that Samuel Thompson can become immortalised and known in the Netherworld universe as <em>Sa’Tho, The Executioner</em> and his Soulshard would allow a ritual that provides players with a boost to their strikes on entities that are close to destruction, while Annabella Armanini could become <em>Anna-Nini, The Most Brilliant</em> and her ritual would increase the player’s Spirit restoration.</p>
<center><hr style=""border-color: #006699; width: 10em;""/></center>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;""><strong>Extraplanar Broadcasts: </strong>When you contribute on the Extraplanar Broadcaster level, you unlock a new screen in the main menu where you can select an Extraplanar Transmission that you want to broadcast. Each Transmission represents a particular bonus, all the players' installations are occasionally synchronised via our server, and when other players encounter an Extraplanar Hyperstone in their universes, they will receive a reward which corresponds to a transmission that is randomly selected from those that the broadcasters currently broadcast.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">In other words, when you are an Extraplanar Broadcaster, it is up to you to choose what reward do the players receive when they encounter an Extraplanar Hyperstone in their worlds, and you are randomly selected between all the broadcasters.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">Every Extraplanar Broadcaster will have their own random Transmission selection to start with, but based on your achievements in the game, you will continually unlock more Transmissions that you can start to broadcast. You can always discuss with other players on the Forums what the best transmission is, but the decision is ultimately always up to you!</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'verdana'; text-align: justify;"">I have learned to work entirely with open source or free-to-use tools, so there are no expenses in this column, and I'll also come back to live in Prague, where the living costs are much more reasonable than in London – so that's why the amount that I crowdsource is less than what it usually is with the videogame propositions. </p>

You can download the demo here. Check the question marks at the bottom of each screen to read up on basic instructions! Also, remember to click on the little dots as well – that is how you collect Essence that you will need.

Netherworld is an abstract exploration rogue-like game with tactical combat encounters, which takes place in a dreamy, ethereal space called the Netherworld. The procedurally generated universe makes sure that no two situations are ever the same, and the robust mechanics always invite you to come up with your own smart and creative solutions. For starters, construct your own custom spellpowers with the open-ended custom spell creation system!

Your exploration quest will take place in an abstract and otherworldly space called the Netherworld, where you can actually encounter places such as an Essence Vortex, a Crystalline Dreamweaver, or a Rich Viridian Cloud. We aim to create an ambience that will be at the same time mysterious, so that you will always want to explore the universe beyond the horizon, and sublime and ornamental in detail, so that you can have a relaxed and meditative aesthetic experience.

 

In its heart, Netherworld is an exploration game and plays around the most classic RPG core loop that we all love: You need to overcome obstacles, so that you can reach more resources, which increase your power, and allow you to overcome even more difficult obstacles and explore even deeper into the universe. There are several ways how you can win – you will need to either beat the ultimate combat encounter, activate all the beacons that are scattered in the world, or enact a unique ritual that requires several rare and exotic components.



 
You will encounter many different locations in your exploration, each with its own particular way to either help or block you on your way to victory. Some locations will provide you with more resources, while others will allow you to boost a particular statistic, or to construct a new spellpower. Some more malicious locations will try to block your exploration ambitions: these will be mostly tactical combat encounters, but could also be monumental wardens that will not let you pass until you activate certain beacons somewhere else, barriers that will open only when you have transmuted a certain crystal or a certain dust, and so on.
While some locations offer you immediate rewards, others provide you with an opportunity that you may choose to return to later, when the circumstances have changed and you possess the necessary resources, or when it turns out that you unexpectedly require their services.
For example, these are some of the locations that you can encounter:
Essence Vortex: You can spend some Essence to harmonise the vortex, which will make it provide you with a little Essence whenever you win in a battle. Essence is the most universal resource you have, and to harmonise a vortex is basically an investment.
Attentive/Observant/Sleepless/Wary Sentinel: The Sentinel will not let you pass, at least not until you learn its secret – which may be located somewhere else in the universe, maybe?
Chromatic Catalyst: You can use the Chromatic Catalyst to transmute your elementary dusts into more potent, composite dusts. For example, you can transmute Crimson Ashes, Scarlet Powder and Vermilion Cinders to create the Garnet Dust, and so on. You always exhaust the Catalyst a little when you use it, up until the point where you cannot use it anymore, and have to locate another one.
Azure/Carmine/Brass Transmuter: Transmuters allow you to transmute basic dusts that you have an abundance of into other basic dusts that you perhaps need more importantly at the moment. However, every Transmuter only works with the dusts of a particular color: Azure with blue, Carmine with red, and Brass with yellow.
Oscillator: You have two options how to calibrate the Oscillator – either to an Equilibrium Oscillator, which increases your Stability, or to a Considerance Oscillator, which boosts your Spirit. The Oscillators provide you with a more substantial bonus when you calibrate more of them in the same way, so you have to balance between a more substantial bonus to one statistic, or a less substantial one to both.
Transcendental Monument: The Monument allows you to learn a new vocation. Unlike at the Archway, where you can only learn the one vocation that is available at that Archway, the Monument allows you to choose which vocation you want to pick up. However, it costs you more Experience to unlock a vocation at the Monument than what it would cost at the Archway.
Crystalline Dreamweaver: You can spend Essence to unlock an additional spellpower slot that you can load up your spellpowers into while in a combat encounter.
The robust core mechanics allow for a lot of space for many unique locations, and we absolutely want to explore this breadth, so that you can encounter new locations even when many hours down the road!

In order to reach new locations and reap their sweet, sweet rewards, you will have to overcome many anomaly encounters, which is where Netherworld switches to its turn-based, open-ended tactical combat mode. There are several basic encounter schemes that determine what you have to achieve in order to overcome the encounter, such as Elimination, Assassination, Assault or Survival, and then there are several randomly chosen entities, each with its own particular mischievous way to try and stop you.



 
Every entity has a very simple action that it takes whenever you cast any ability: Noises will reduce your Stability, Spectres will drain your Spirit, while Abominations will countdown until they explode and hurt you real bad. Some entities, such as Wards, may raise barriers around or directly heal other entities, while Constructors spawn more entities until you stop them. And you better be ready when you meet the Nemesis, because, well, it doesn't like you.
The important part is that while the all the entities by themselves are usually really straightforward in what they do, it's their random selection system that creates an enormous possibility space of how many scenarios you can potentially encounter, each with its own very distinct dynamic. When you have an Abomination cluster that will blow your Stability away in ten turns time, a Noise Constructor that continuously spawns new Noises which reduce your Stability every turn, and a Spectre line-up which, in the meantime, drains your Spirit that you need to cast your spellpowers every turn – what do you do?
The most important decision that you have to make in a battle is what spellpowers you choose to load up into your spellpower slots. You can choose which spellpowers you want to load up into your ability slots whenever you want, but once you pick a spellpower into a slot, that is indeed what spellpower you will have in that slot for the entire battle! Your power selection will have primordial impact on how well you will probably do in the battle, because based on what entities are on the screen, and what do you need to achieve, some abilities will be pretty much exactly what you need, while others may simply make no sense. What makes or breaks your success is always how well can you understand the situation that you are in, and choose an appropriate toolset that will help you effectively achieve what you need to do.
TL;DR: You can leave your leet minmax Excel skills at home this time, because it is time to show some actual smart play!








 

'So, what is this that I hear about that I can construct my own spells? I have always wanted to do that!', I hear you say. I know! I have always wanted to construct my own spells in RPGs. I usually play as a caster class when I can, and I think that the most important reason why people choose to play a spellcaster is because you want to play as this awesome person who is badass, but in a smart, sophisticated way. You want to win thanks to how you have outsmarted your opponent, how you came up with a brilliant idea in the important moment, and how you can exploit the mechanics to make them serve whatever it is that you currently need to do. Because you are an individuality, a smart phenomenon to be reckoned with. Which means that obviously, it won’t do to just dumbly repeat the same spells that everybody does! You want your own! Duh!



 
Well, it's true – in Netherworld, you actually have to construct all your spellpowers that you want to have available in the combat encounters to come. You can construct new spellpowers in the exploration phase, when you encounter a special location called a Monolith. Every Monolith allows you to construct one particular spellpower based around the provided central core, which determines what the power will do and its basic numbers, but which also always comes with several runeslots into which you can load up runes that may take your new spell in many dramatically different directions.
For example, Destabilise, which is the basic offensive strike spellpower, can be constructed in such a way that it will either heal you based on the hits that it delivers (which makes it essentially a Drain Health spell), or maybe so that it will hit all the enemies in the cluster (which makes it basically an AoE), or have the Impact quality attached to it (which works as a stun), or you can even make it deliver the hits in a particular Force (so that you can make, say, a Chaotic or a Void spell).
The cool part is that the runeslot structure means that you can combine all these in any way you please, and thus create powers such as a chaotic stun, an AoE drain, or even a chaotic AoE drain stun (I know you want to!). However, you have to keep in mind that every component usually increases the spellpower's cooldown and/or the Spirit that you will need to cast it, or maybe have some other downside to it, such as that it can make the spell only available to be cast X times in any one battle. Which means that when you construct a new spell, you need to consider what your current stats will be able to actually make work in a battle, and what may be a little too cool for you at the moment!
Also, you can only use every Monolith once, and the power composition does cost some resources, so you need to think twice about how to design the power in such a way that it will work well in combination with the other abilities that you have, in the environment that you are currently in, with your attunements and traits, and so on. 

While what you have read above constitutes the core mechanics in Netherworld, there are also several complementary mechanics in play. We aim to have a very robust, yet intricate and ornamental mechanics architecture, which will provide you with many opportunities to capitalise when you pay attention to detail in your decisions.
To name a couple, the secondary mechanics include:
Forces: There are six Forces in the Netherworld: Darkness/Luminosity, Void/Matter and Order/Chaos, which some entities may be particularly vulnerable or resistant to.
Transmutation: In numerous Clouds, Hazes, and Mists, you can collect many peculiar dusts and powders that you can then transmute at catalysts and transmuters to create even more potent substances. You can then use these to enact various rituals at the Altars or the Immortals' Soulshards, which can provide you with many different boosts, such as to your stats or Experience, or even with some entirely unique qualities.
Crystals: You will occasionally stumble upon crystals, which may be required as a component in the most potent rituals, or can be used as a key to unlock locations that would be unreachable otherwise. When you cleanse the crystals, you will also be able to decompose them at a Quartz Disassambler to boost up your Essence reserves.



 
Vocations: Vocations – such as Explorer, Invoker, Transmuter, or Curator – allow you to unlock and level up various traits related to a particular mechanic or statistic. Vocations can be unlocked with Experience, which you earn mainly when you overcome the combat encounters. 
Pockets: Parts of the world (with some sweet rewards, of course!) will remain concealed unless you deploy some means to reveal them. This could be done by activating a nearby Vista, with a trait in the Observer vocation, or in a couple of other manners.
Attunements: Occasionally, you will encounter various Statues in the world, where you can adopt an attunement which provides you with a particular bonus, such as a straight-up numerical boost, or an entirely unique quality. You can only have so many attunements adopted at any one time, so you will eventually need to decide which ones to drop, so that you can replace them with the cooler ones that you encounter as you explore.
Certainly, this is not in any way an exhaustive list – we want to create a very rich and subtly interconnected mechanical system, but hopefully these should be able to make you understand the overall vision!

I'm Martin, I'm 25 and I currently pursue an MA in Digital Games Design & Theory at Brunel University in London, which BTW is absolutely brilliant. Shoutout to all the Brunel Games people! I have a BSc equivalent in Computer Science, and another BA that I have almost completed in French Literature.

 
I have made several games that you can check out when you have a spare minute, such as the experimental surrealist Wake Up Call, which is currently nominated in the Student Game Competition on CHI 2013 in Paris for Innovative Game Design; the narrative-heavy Spider, where you play as a hacker that penetrates networks within their 3D network visualisations; or Letteria, an intense type-'em-up arcade that I did about six years back and that I will probably rerelease sometime around now. 



 
I learned to code when I was 12, and I don't think there were ever more than a couple consecutive weeks since then when I wouldn't code in some way. I have made, as a contracted work or a personal project, 2D games, 3D games, online games, office applications, websites, magazines, mods, libraries, and cash register drivers, and I have learned many lessons the hard way, but as a result I can now quite naturally do whatever it is that I need to do, and can concentrate on how to create a deeper and a more creative design. I would not present you with Netherworld if I would not be absolutely sure that I can deliver on what I promise, but I am!
Games have always been my passion. I earned all my teenage money writing videogame reviews, and it was only natural that I chose to pursue a technical and an artistic university course, so that I could learn about games from both the perspectives. I moved mountains to come here to London this year, so that I could pursue an MA in Digital Game Design, which I am now about to complete in about two months. 
I started to think about what eventually became Netherworld about two years ago now, and I have made several experimental prototypes to arrive to the current design. I am confident that I have an awesome game on my hands now, and I need your guys' help to make it happen!

I am a code-oriented developer much more than I am a visual artist, so what you can see in the video and in the screenshots all around here serves only to demonstrate the visual concept that I have, and how I would eventually like Netherworld to look like – I will need to hire an actual visual artist, who will be able to realise this vision with the subtlety that it needs. I do have several very talented people in mind, and I think that I should actually be able to update you with some exciting news in this aspect soon!

Now, it is up to you to make sure that all that can actually happen! This is the make or break moment in the Netherworld development, and we really need your support now, so that we can make the concept that we believe is awesome become a well-polished reality.
You can see that there are several levels on which you can back the development, and I would now like to explain clearly how the reward system is laid out. These are the the basics that apply to all the contribution levels:
The reward system is cumulative: This means that whichever level you choose to contribute on, you always automatically have access to all the previous perks as well.
Achievements: Every contribution level automatically unlocks an achievement with the same name, so that we can make other people know that you have contributed when it was the most important. This means a Steam achievement, should we launch on Steam, and certainly one in the Netherworld's achievement screen.
Forum icons: There will be a Netherworld Forum to invite discussions about Netherworld, and each contribution tier will provide you with a very special icon displayed next to all your posts while over there.
Remembrance Wall: Remembrance Wall is a boundless wall that can be opened in the main menu and which eternally commemorates and honors all the backers that have helped made the Netherworld development possible. Backers in the upper tiers always receive a certain special visual distinction or a more prominent position on the Wall than the previous tiers.
Be sure to let us know in case that you would be interested in another way in which we could appreciate your help – we will surely work it out!

There are several special locations that are designed especially with you as the contributors in mind, so that you can leave an even more permanent mark on the Netherworld universe. Besides, we sincerely believe that these can create some brilliant crowd-sourced content, such as with the Obelisks, enable you to have your name sound unexpectedly cool, such as with the Immortals, or bestow you with some awesome and unusual meta powers, such as with the Broadcaster!
It is also important to know that since every contributor's copy will be connected to his or her backer contribution, a very special event will occur when you encounter your own Founder's Stone, or any other special location dedicated to you.
Founder’s Stone: Founder’s Stone is a rather common location, which instantly increases the player’s Stability by a small amount. Every Founder’s Stone commemorates a randomly selected Netherworld backer, whose name is displayed along a short poetic text in the location description.

Enlightenment Obelisk: Enlightenment Obelisk is a special location which, besides an instant boost to the players Spirit and Experience, displays an actual advice that has been supplied by a randomly selected backer with the particular perk. In other words, every Netherworld backer that has contributed at least on the necessary level can send us an actual advice that he or she wants to share with other players via the Obelisks. The advice should be about a sentence or two, and should at least remotely resonate with the overall transcendental ambience, but we promise we will be very open minded. For example, 'Fortune sides with him who dares' is a clear OK, as is 'Remember that today is the yesterday’s tomorrow', but we will probably need you to convince us a little more about 'Don’t shit where you eat'.

Immortal’s Soulshard: Immortal's Soulshard is a monument that is always related to a particular Immortal, and allows the player to enact a unique, expensive, but very potent ritual specific to the particular Immortal. When you back Netherworld on the respective tier, we will work with you to create an Immortal based around your name: that means that we will translate your name to match the Immortal name style, and because every Immortal also comes with an epithet (because that is indeed how they roll), you can choose how do you want your Immortal to be known in the Netherworld lore. We will also work with you to design a unique ritual that will resonate with your created Immortal identity.
For example, this means that Samuel Thompson can become immortalised and known in the Netherworld universe as Sa’Tho, The Executioner and his Soulshard would allow a ritual that provides players with a boost to their strikes on entities that are close to destruction, while Annabella Armanini could become Anna-Nini, The Most Brilliant and her ritual would increase the player’s Spirit restoration.

Extraplanar Broadcasts: When you contribute on the Extraplanar Broadcaster level, you unlock a new screen in the main menu where you can select an Extraplanar Transmission that you want to broadcast. Each Transmission represents a particular bonus, all the players' installations are occasionally synchronised via our server, and when other players encounter an Extraplanar Hyperstone in their universes, they will receive a reward which corresponds to a transmission that is randomly selected from those that the broadcasters currently broadcast.
In other words, when you are an Extraplanar Broadcaster, it is up to you to choose what reward do the players receive when they encounter an Extraplanar Hyperstone in their worlds, and you are randomly selected between all the broadcasters.
Every Extraplanar Broadcaster will have their own random Transmission selection to start with, but based on your achievements in the game, you will continually unlock more Transmissions that you can start to broadcast. You can always discuss with other players on the Forums what the best transmission is, but the decision is ultimately always up to you!

Developed in LÖVE, Netherworld will be available on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.


The amount that I raise will be spend in two primary ways: I will need to hire a visual artist that will help me realise the visual vision that I have, and I also need to survive the entire development process in terms of not starving to death and having a place to stay and an internet access.
I have learned to work entirely with open source or free-to-use tools, so there are no expenses in this column, and I'll also come back to live in Prague, where the living costs are much more reasonable than in London – so that's why the amount that I crowdsource is less than what it usually is with the videogame propositions. 

My expectation is to release Netherworld in the Q1 2014.

I wanted to let you know that 5% of any sales that I make on Netherworld when it releases will be split between the Red Cross, the World Wildlife Fund, and Child's Play.



 

Thank you! I really appreciate if you decide to help to make this happen. The most direct way is certainly to actually contribute, but it does really also help out a lot when you simply spread the word!",45.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The full game with all the features we want to include
in it will cost more than the sum we aim to raise through IndieGoGo.
We have already invested a considerable amount of our own money. 
</p>
<p>We have chosen to put this project on IndieGoGo,
because we wholeheartedly believe in the power of collaboration, and
we want wonderful people like you involved! 
</p>
<p>Part of the funds received will cover IndieGoGo costs
as well as transaction fees, taxes, and expenses related to
manufacturing and shipping physical rewards. The rest of the raised
by this project will be used mainly on the following:</p>
<p>* Full
translation of the game to English by professional translators.</p>
<p>* Writing
the full version of the game scenario and the individualization of
the characters, dialogue and so on.</p>
<p>* Sound
design, because it's one of the key elements of gameplay, which
creating the whole game atmosphere, so this is going to be a large
job requiring months of intensive work.</p>
<p>* Payment of
testers to check the stability of the final version of the game on
all planned platforms.</p>
<p>* All the
extra work hired freelancers such as: polishing the GUI design,
animated cutscenes, additional artworks and other small tasks.</p>

<p>We are determined to
complete the game but without funds from IndieGoGo, though, it will
take a much longer development time and we will have to omit some
features and content, especially material produced by external
designers.</p>
<p>Because game development is
hard to predict, there may be delays in the original plan.
Budget-wise, we plan to set aside a reserve fund to cover potential
delays. Should our estimated workflow proceed as expected, the
reserve will be used for free post-release updates, fixes,
enhancements etc.; otherwise we are prepared for a possible longer
development time.</p>
<p>We will keep everyone

in it will cost more than the sum we aim to raise through IndieGoGo.
We have already invested a considerable amount of our own money. 

We have chosen to put this project on IndieGoGo,
because we wholeheartedly believe in the power of collaboration, and
we want wonderful people like you involved! 

Part of the funds received will cover IndieGoGo costs
as well as transaction fees, taxes, and expenses related to
manufacturing and shipping physical rewards. The rest of the raised
by this project will be used mainly on the following:
* Full
translation of the game to English by professional translators.
* Writing
the full version of the game scenario and the individualization of
the characters, dialogue and so on.
* Sound
design, because it's one of the key elements of gameplay, which
creating the whole game atmosphere, so this is going to be a large
job requiring months of intensive work.
* Payment of
testers to check the stability of the final version of the game on
all planned platforms.
* All the
extra work hired freelancers such as: polishing the GUI design,
animated cutscenes, additional artworks and other small tasks.

We are determined to
complete the game but without funds from IndieGoGo, though, it will
take a much longer development time and we will have to omit some
features and content, especially material produced by external
designers.
Because game development is
hard to predict, there may be delays in the original plan.
Budget-wise, we plan to set aside a reserve fund to cover potential
delays. Should our estimated workflow proceed as expected, the
reserve will be used for free post-release updates, fixes,
enhancements etc.; otherwise we are prepared for a possible longer
development time.
We will keep everyone
updated to make sure you know what we are doing at every moment and
which phase we are in.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Subtle Stone</h3>
We're a two-man indie game studio based in San Francisco, CA trying to make the world a better place to live in through the power of video games. 
<h3>What is Dark Deception</h3>
<p>Dark Deception is an epic sci-fi RPG to be released under an open-source license. The game takes place in the year 2019 in the former state of California, eleven years after civil war left the region under the rule of two private military corporations, MSF and ESA, which are perpetually at an uneasy truce. Xavier Harvey, a young mercenary from the former company, unintentionally breaks a peace treaty, thereby reigniting an apocalyptic war between both corporations. The player’s adventure follows Xavier’s quest to resolve the conflict and end the very war that he started. Will the corporations make peace, or will the war escalate to engulf and consume the world itself? This story can only be told with your help, so assess for yourself whether or not this fictional world is truly one worth saving. </p>

We will use the surplus money to move to full-time development, support more platforms, and to hire new personnel to add to the studio. We're going to make this fun. For donating, we have exclusive and rare rewards such as in-game equipment, signed copies, and opprotunites to influence development!

<h3>Why do we need you?</h3>
<p>The whole idea has been in development for about 1.5-2 years right now. It's difficult to trace it's start, because it began with some inspiration, thinking and drawing, It's been quite chaotic and I just took notes - I wasn't thinking then, that it will grow so big.</p>
<p>Quite lot of time, right? Well, but there was also a lot of other stuff to do - company, freelancing, etc. After that time I managed to form a team and now I'll have to pay all that great people so as to fuel the game development.  So now you know, why I need you :). </p>
<p>Of course, we have a solidplan for that game. Let me introduce our stretch goals:</p>

<p>As you'll be scrolling down, you'll see, that rewards are a pretty lucrative deal. Lifetime discount for all products! C'mon, who else will give you that?<br/>Of course, I'll be always giving people as much value as I can, but for those, who are with me at the beginning, I want to do something special.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>GET IT FOR FREE! Spread the word!</h3>I prepared even more coolness for you. I'll give my game for free to some of you. How will I make it and why it's a win-win deal for everyone?<br/><br/>Ok, so here is how it works<ul>
<li>Post a private comment or contact me through e-mail, whatever you like</li>
<li>Leave me your e-mail address</li>
<li>I'll send you a promo code</li>
<li>Now bring me your friends, and ask them to write your promo code next to the name, when they contribute (like this: <b>Name | Code</b>)</li>
<li>If you bring me at least 3 of your friends, you'll get the game for free! Yay!</li>
<li>Each friend must contribute at least $10</li>
</ul> You'll be able to get most rewards that way (believer and apostole rewards don't count, cause I don't think I could handle more people) - the general idea is that your friends need to contribute triple amount of your reward value (discount prices don't apply to you). If any of your friends buys a discounted package, price after discount will add to your value, not regular price.<br/> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/866214/files/20140918093658-referrals.jpg?1411058218"" src="""" style=""""/></p>One <span>condition</span>: your referral buddies can't have their codes, they must buy package - otherwise I'd give away for free everytning - and that's not how it works. It have to be win-win :). If you want a free package by referrals, but you bought first - no refunds. On the other side, time limitations don't apply to you. Fair enough, right?<br/> <h3>Experience</h3>I have several years of experience as a freelance artist in the game industry, I'm also running a company - a graphic studio - together with my wife. So, I also have experience as a web &amp; graphic designer, copywriter and marketer (like everyone doing his own business).<br/>I'm also on a good way to becoming a business owner, because more and more rarely I have this feeling that business owns me :).<br/> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/865737/files/20140918033625-experience.jpg?1411036585"" src="""" style=""""/></p>I have worked on several games so far. I was a co-author of OddPlanet, where I did everything related to graphic - including level design, animations, logo, GUI, concepts and assets creation. I also created two games myself, using Construct2 engine - <a href=""http://scraplite.clay.io"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Scrap</a> (2d Descent-like shooter) and <a href=""http://pulsespace.clay.io"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pulse</a> (space themed tower defense, with some innovative ideas). Players reacted positively, but there were technical issues with html5 technology, so I decided to team up with a programmer. I also work as a main artist for Dungeoneers, where I care about every visual aspect of that game (right now we're redoing almost everything, so you won't see much of my work there yet).<br/> <h3>Core Team<br/> </h3>

Creating games was the biggest dream of his childhood, and now he is making this dream come true. He has experience not only as a game designer and an artist, but also as a graphic and web designer, copywriter - because he did many different things while not realizing his dream. But that's a whole different story...<br/><br/> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/866933/files/20140918144445-ed.jpg?1411076685"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <b>Ed</b><br/>Ed began his adventure with programming computer games right after first computers were available, back in the Atari age. So obviously, he has a LOT of experience. He worked on his own and as a subcontractor. He created a real-life tram simulator. Unfortunatelly, I can't reveal his identity because we afraid that Russian government will go after him for hacking some nuclear missiles. Well, who hasn't done some silly things in the youth?<br/><br/> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/866938/files/20140918144524-hubert.jpg?1411076724"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <b>Hubert Świątek</b><br/>He is a world-class composer and his work is going to make this game huge, because thanks to that you will really feel a cold breath of the ancient ones...<br/>Hubert did music for movies, theater performances, he worked with a famous polish VFX studio.<span>  He cooperated with Gdynia Film School and PWST National Academy of Theatre Arts in Krakow</span>.<br/> <h3>Other contributors</h3>

<p><b>Daniel Niszczota</b><br/>Concept and assets artist. His imagination really makes impression. I don't know how he does this, but it looks like he has a connection with some higher being, because concepts seem to just flow through him.

<p><b>4u4avfx</b><br/>A great animator, that will make this game look alive. He's a godsend, because - to be honest - my animation just sucks and his is just great. That will prevent you all from throwing eggs at me. Win-win.</p> <b>Tobias Ezra Queen</b><br/>He did awesome deep, crushing voiceover for the intro. Thanks to him, you're still reading this, so for that I am really grateful.<br/> <ul></ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<b>I die.</b><br/>Well, I can't do pretty much then :(. That's the only risk I can't overcome really. I think that war, pestilence, earthquake etc. should also fall into this category.<br/><br/><b>I get seriously sick.</b><br/>That's the second thing that could get me out of the business. Being aware of that, I try to eat and live healthy, and also keep some inner balance - yoga, sports, meditation - to be not only physically, but also mentally in a good shape. <br/><br/><b>We hit some technical obstacle impossible to overcome.</b><br/>There are few things that protects us against it. We use Unity engine, that has all tools necessary to make a game like this, and we try to keep things simple.<br/><br/><b>One of teammates quits.</b><br/>Only Ed's quitting could really cause a problem. I hope it never happens but in such a case I find another programmer. Thanks to my experience in almost all areas of the development process, and due to some experience in recruiting people for our business, it will be easier. We also use Unity and Git for versioning.<br/><br/><b>It gets more expensive than I supposed.</b><br/>That's why I assumec some buffer in the budget. That's why we try to keep things simple thus predictable, and that's why I began looking for subcontractors long time ago.<br/> </div><div>
<h3>Questions?</h3>If you have any questions about the game, please use comments section to ask them. I'll answer all of them. Not personally, though, because there will be thousands of you, but most of you will have similar questions.<br/> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Thank you!</h3>

GET IT FOR FREE! Spread the word!I prepared even more coolness for you. I'll give my game for free to some of you. How will I make it and why it's a win-win deal for everyone?Ok, so here is how it works
Post a private comment or contact me through e-mail, whatever you like
Leave me your e-mail address
I'll send you a promo code
Now bring me your friends, and ask them to write your promo code next to the name, when they contribute (like this: Name | Code)
If you bring me at least 3 of your friends, you'll get the game for free! Yay!
Each friend must contribute at least $10
 You'll be able to get most rewards that way (believer and apostole rewards don't count, cause I don't think I could handle more people) - the general idea is that your friends need to contribute triple amount of your reward value (discount prices don't apply to you). If any of your friends buys a discounted package, price after discount will add to your value, not regular price. One condition: your referral buddies can't have their codes, they must buy package - otherwise I'd give away for free everytning - and that's not how it works. It have to be win-win :). If you want a free package by referrals, but you bought first - no refunds. On the other side, time limitations don't apply to you. Fair enough, right? ExperienceI have several years of experience as a freelance artist in the game industry, I'm also running a company - a graphic studio - together with my wife. So, I also have experience as a web & graphic designer, copywriter and marketer (like everyone doing his own business).I'm also on a good way to becoming a business owner, because more and more rarely I have this feeling that business owns me :). I have worked on several games so far. I was a co-author of OddPlanet, where I did everything related to graphic - including level design, animations, logo, GUI, concepts and assets creation. I also created two games myself, using Construct2 engine - Scrap (2d Descent-like shooter) and Pulse (space themed tower defense, with some innovative ideas). Players reacted positively, but there were technical issues with html5 technology, so I decided to team up with a programmer. I also work as a main artist for Dungeoneers, where I care about every visual aspect of that game (right now we're redoing almost everything, so you won't see much of my work there yet). Core Team 
Sewer Hrehorowicz (that's me :)The Author of the game and a lead artist. Creating games was the biggest dream of his childhood, and now he is making this dream come true. He has experience not only as a game designer and an artist, but also as a graphic and web designer, copywriter - because he did many different things while not realizing his dream. But that's a whole different story...  EdEd began his adventure with programming computer games right after first computers were available, back in the Atari age. So obviously, he has a LOT of experience. He worked on his own and as a subcontractor. He created a real-life tram simulator. Unfortunatelly, I can't reveal his identity because we afraid that Russian government will go after him for hacking some nuclear missiles. Well, who hasn't done some silly things in the youth?  Hubert ŚwiątekHe is a world-class composer and his work is going to make this game huge, because thanks to that you will really feel a cold breath of the ancient ones...Hubert did music for movies, theater performances, he worked with a famous polish VFX studio.  He cooperated with Gdynia Film School and PWST National Academy of Theatre Arts in Krakow. Other contributors
 
 

Daniel NiszczotaConcept and assets artist. His imagination really makes impression. I don't know how he does this, but it looks like he has a connection with some higher being, because concepts seem to just flow through him. Thanks to his passion and dedication to work, few years from now he will become one of world's best. 
 
 

4u4avfxA great animator, that will make this game look alive. He's a godsend, because - to be honest - my animation just sucks and his is just great. That will prevent you all from throwing eggs at me. Win-win. Tobias Ezra QueenHe did awesome deep, crushing voiceover for the intro. Thanks to him, you're still reading this, so for that I am really grateful. 
  
Risks & Challenges
I die.Well, I can't do pretty much then :(. That's the only risk I can't overcome really. I think that war, pestilence, earthquake etc. should also fall into this category.I get seriously sick.That's the second thing that could get me out of the business. Being aware of that, I try to eat and live healthy, and also keep some inner balance - yoga, sports, meditation - to be not only physically, but also mentally in a good shape. We hit some technical obstacle impossible to overcome.There are few things that protects us against it. We use Unity engine, that has all tools necessary to make a game like this, and we try to keep things simple.One of teammates quits.Only Ed's quitting could really cause a problem. I hope it never happens but in such a case I find another programmer. Thanks to my experience in almost all areas of the development process, and due to some experience in recruiting people for our business, it will be easier. We also use Unity and Git for versioning.It gets more expensive than I supposed.That's why I assumec some buffer in the budget. That's why we try to keep things simple thus predictable, and that's why I began looking for subcontractors long time ago. 
Questions?If you have any questions about the game, please use comments section to ask them. I'll answer all of them. Not personally, though, because there will be thousands of you, but most of you will have similar questions. Thank you!

Lead them into action against other human players, alone or in coop.The Orcies of Orcland are cute, clumsy and smart - not to mention fearsome! They are a rowdy bunch and love getting into fights - in Orcland, any day they are not clubbing each other over the head is a wasted day. Or at the very least a boring one, which is basically the same.

The Orcs live in small groups and villages and are not fond of technology. They have more of a Stone Age-thing going on.
Lead the Orcies into battle and help them become the strongest and most famous tribe in all the land! Explore huge tech trees and arm your Orcies with the very best weapons and items! Customize their outfit and make them look exactly the way you want.


We are a small team of four experienced game devs from beautiful Munich, Germany, best known for the infamous Oktoberfest and related Orc-like behaviour. :)
Building on our years of experience and our proven skills in the game industry, we want to realize our vision of a fun and accessible real-time-strategy game. We have spent the last couple of months building a fully functional, great-looking, well-designed, and most importantly, fun prototype for Orcland in our free time.


We are doing this without any money - we are driven by our passion and the fun of it. We have a vision for a great game and we want you to be able to play it!!

Our team loves real-time strategy games like Starcraft, Warcraft and Age of Empires. However, these games can be really hard to get into and need a lot of time-invest to play them. We would love to create a RTS that is easily accessible, and that you and your friends can play anywhere. Orcland is exactly about this!Orcland is a multiplayer-only game with optional social features and focus on orc characters you can fall in love with. We want to make it easy to play, easy to find your friends and easy to immerse yourself in, while still having a great RTS feel.


What makes Orcland so special, you ask? We think it's the following 3 things which set Orcland apart from the rest:Focus on CharactersWe have created an intriguing game-world filled with beautiful and lovable characters. We want 
them to be in the focus of this game. These are not expendable marines 
that you recruit from a barracks - they are your tribe and they grow and 
develop with you. They do not die in battle and you can customize the 
way they look. They develop over time with the experience they 
gather.


Easy EntryOrcland is a game which is very easy to get into. It will run on tablets and in web browsers using a free-to-play model. More and more game rules will be introduced over time, but this will be done gradually - we want players to feel comfortable in the game at all times.Social FeaturesWe feel that we can enrich the game with optional social features. That way it will be super-easy to find your friends in the game and play with them or against them. Trading items and other coop features will make the game more fun.


Until now we have spent our development time to create a great-looking multi-player prototype (the one in the trailer). We have put a lot of time into playtesting, making sure that it is really fun to play, and that all the concepts we came up with actually work!Now we have the game running locally in our local networks and the time has come to bring it online, so you fine people can actually play and enjoy it!
The prototype is not a finished game, instead we have focused on the core mechanics.



Behind the scenes:




To bring the game online we will have to spend money on the game for the first time to buy a pro license of our game engine Unity3D. We need the pro version to be able to run the Orcland server on an internet host machine.We currently do not have the funds to buy the pro licence which costs roughly 1100 €. We are turning to you to help us make this great game available for you!We need roughly 1100 € ($1500) to buy the pro version of Unity3D. We will then build a web version of the Orcland server and host it online. The game will be available to all backers!If there is an amount that exceeds the Unity3D license cost, we will use it to speed up the development significantly. Part of our team will then go fulltime on the game.                                                                                                                 
If we get funded, we promise to release our prototype online. Each and every backer will get alpha access to play the game whilst it is in development! We will then continue to work on the game and bring out new features. You will be the first to see them and your feedback will help to shape the game! Also check out the list of rewards below!

<h3>Check The Media Section For Details On How To Play And Example Of Play</h3>
<h3>Strech goals will be added as limits are reached. I don't want to bait you into helping more than you want to.</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Have you ever wanted to do more than roll some dice to see if you won an argument? Is the randomness, finality, and overall lack of control, unable to give the sense of drama in your RPG sessions? We'll Send It To Them is a universal system that could be just the thing you're looking for to enable such desires.<br/><br/>What makes it so special? The first thing that makes this essential is the level of involvement for the players. Whenever a conflict occurs, both parties help create the focus of the roleplay. They frame the tension, the passion and reality of the situation as their characters would see it and enables an experience that can't be achieved with freeform techniques found in most story games. It allows for players to become tied to their character and perform closer to what they intended the character to be in their head than just another backdrop dressing for a typical adventure of slaying dragons in some dark dungeon.<br/><br/>The system itself is simple, cohesive, and fast. You'll never have to flip thru hundreds of pages to fully understand it or play dozens of sessions to master it. In fact, you can fit everything you need on a 4''x6'' card with room to spare!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">How does it achieve this? How does it work? If you read further, I'll explain how it works, then why I need your help to make this.<br/><br/><strong>How To Play</strong><br/><br/>Play begins whenever you want to have an in-depth debate, conversation, or argument. This could also be used to stretch out tension in a duel or other dramatic moments in your game. Both players agree with who will go first, then state what their characters want to accomplish if they win. Then, the first player gives preferably a one word emotion/object or phrase that could affect both characters. This word or phrase is called a weakness; a thing that could affect either character and cause them to lose. Each player goes back and forth repeating this step until both players do this 3 times, with a total of 6 weaknesses.<br/><br/>Both players then secretly choose 3 of those 6 weaknesses they think fits what their character is feeling. After that, they can begin play. Already from that framing of the scene, both players now have a great understanding how to roleplay their character without resorting to out of character discussion of what has happened in this scene. The focus stays on their characters, allowing for a greater sense of immersion most scene framing mechanics don't use.<br/><br/>Finally, the first player selects 3 of those 6 weaknesses and includes them in his first attack on the second player. The player applies those weaknesses as methods of manipulation to win over the other player. Once done, the second player will respond to each attack based on the weakness chosen. If a weakness was correctly chosen, the attacked player must acknowledge it worked. For every one that wasn't their weakness, they must respond in a negative way to let the attacking player know it didn't work. The second player then begins their turn and repeats the order of play again.<br/><br/>Once one of the players correctly selects all three weaknesses in one attack, that player wins the conflict. As you can see, the system itself allows for easy modification as well as enabling both players to express what their characters want and how they feel in the moment. It's great for that imposing villain spouting his dream for world domination or a pivotal moment when trying to prevent a character from jumping off that ledge to their doom.<br/><br/><strong>Why I Need Your Help</strong><br/><br/>While I want the system to be freely distributed for people to use, I also want to create a central hub to gather peoples' creations. The system works very well as a written format since it allows for people to take their time and respond in a sincere manner. If written, a trace of the game is left for others to read that are typically more intriguing than any actual play report could ever give. I want that space to exist so everyone can go there and read all these stories while also meeting each other for playing the game.

Strech goals will be added as limits are reached. I don't want to bait you into helping more than you want to.
Have you ever wanted to do more than roll some dice to see if you won an argument? Is the randomness, finality, and overall lack of control, unable to give the sense of drama in your RPG sessions? We'll Send It To Them is a universal system that could be just the thing you're looking for to enable such desires.What makes it so special? The first thing that makes this essential is the level of involvement for the players. Whenever a conflict occurs, both parties help create the focus of the roleplay. They frame the tension, the passion and reality of the situation as their characters would see it and enables an experience that can't be achieved with freeform techniques found in most story games. It allows for players to become tied to their character and perform closer to what they intended the character to be in their head than just another backdrop dressing for a typical adventure of slaying dragons in some dark dungeon.The system itself is simple, cohesive, and fast. You'll never have to flip thru hundreds of pages to fully understand it or play dozens of sessions to master it. In fact, you can fit everything you need on a 4''x6'' card with room to spare!
 
How does it achieve this? How does it work? If you read further, I'll explain how it works, then why I need your help to make this.How To PlayPlay begins whenever you want to have an in-depth debate, conversation, or argument. This could also be used to stretch out tension in a duel or other dramatic moments in your game. Both players agree with who will go first, then state what their characters want to accomplish if they win. Then, the first player gives preferably a one word emotion/object or phrase that could affect both characters. This word or phrase is called a weakness; a thing that could affect either character and cause them to lose. Each player goes back and forth repeating this step until both players do this 3 times, with a total of 6 weaknesses.Both players then secretly choose 3 of those 6 weaknesses they think fits what their character is feeling. After that, they can begin play. Already from that framing of the scene, both players now have a great understanding how to roleplay their character without resorting to out of character discussion of what has happened in this scene. The focus stays on their characters, allowing for a greater sense of immersion most scene framing mechanics don't use.Finally, the first player selects 3 of those 6 weaknesses and includes them in his first attack on the second player. The player applies those weaknesses as methods of manipulation to win over the other player. Once done, the second player will respond to each attack based on the weakness chosen. If a weakness was correctly chosen, the attacked player must acknowledge it worked. For every one that wasn't their weakness, they must respond in a negative way to let the attacking player know it didn't work. The second player then begins their turn and repeats the order of play again.Once one of the players correctly selects all three weaknesses in one attack, that player wins the conflict. As you can see, the system itself allows for easy modification as well as enabling both players to express what their characters want and how they feel in the moment. It's great for that imposing villain spouting his dream for world domination or a pivotal moment when trying to prevent a character from jumping off that ledge to their doom.Why I Need Your HelpWhile I want the system to be freely distributed for people to use, I also want to create a central hub to gather peoples' creations. The system works very well as a written format since it allows for people to take their time and respond in a sincere manner. If written, a trace of the game is left for others to read that are typically more intriguing than any actual play report could ever give. I want that space to exist so everyone can go there and read all these stories while also meeting each other for playing the game. I could get a free forum to try this, but users won't be able to upload photos directly to the site and they'll be quite a few other problems with ease of use if I went with a free site. That is where you come into play.To help fund this dream, I created a 4x6 template that if used, can be printed out to make your very own postcard to play the game via mail.

<p><b>Panzer Clash is an easy-to-pick-up yet highly strategic, fully customizable card game for 2 - 4 players (best with 2 players) all about Second World War Panzer Battles.</b> What we are offering you is <b>a huge box of no less than 430 cards</b> (probably more depending on the success of this very campaign) which will serve as an extensive card pool for countless hours of deckbuilding madness, from which countless hours of highly enjoyable, actual gameplay will result. Panzer Clash features many great mechanics such as an unique resoure system and, best of all, a <b>modular battlefield</b> consisting of various Terrain types, on which you will be moving around your Units, that will be generated at random at the beginning of every game. So no game of Panzer Clash will be the same! More on the actual rules and gameplay later. Alternatively you can<b> watch the video review</b> above, know however that said review is based on an older ""incarnation"" of the game. Still it will give you an idea of how Panzer Clash is played and what makes it a great, deeply strategic and overall enjoyable gaming experience.</p>
<p>Through this here campaign I am trying to realize Panzer Clash, which I have carefully and relentlessly developed and refined over more than 5 years, with my <b>ultimate goal being not to ""make the big buck""</b>, but rather to spread the game among as many gamers as possible for the greatest pleasure for me derives from  the notion that many people enjoy what I created and are just having a good time with some friends playing Panzer Clash for instance.<b> Hence all is priced for us to break even, not to maximize personal profits.</b></p>
<p><b>And this is where YOU come in</b>, valued potential backer! Having a large print run of a 430+ cards game manufactured and shipped out to customers (that is you, the gamers)  entails immense costs which I could not by any means cover myself, and hence the need for this campaign and hence the need for your pledge!</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/888240/files/20140928143248-Header_2.jpg?1411939968"" src="""" style=""width: 468px; height: 60px;""/></p> <p>By means of this fundraising campaign, I intend to fund the manufacturing and worldwide distribution of a minimum print run size of 500 Units (copies of the game), which is an immensely costly thing to do and hence I am asking for your pledge to realize the game. One man like myself cannot possibly fund a huge project like this on his own, but if many people make their relatively small contribution, even seemingly outrageous amounts of funds can be raised in order to make a project like Panzer Clash a reality - and such is the very nature of crowdfunding. So: Long story short, the money you pledge will go entirely into the manufacturing of the Panzer Clash Customizable Card Game and into sending it out to the backers from all over the world. So the bulk of the costs are twofold basically: Manufacturing / Printing costs and shipping fees.</p>
<p>Now to what everyone has been waiting for:</p>
<h3>We are both pleased and proud to be able to offer you some very fair and also unique PERKS!</h3>
<div>We tried to keep the different perks as simple as possible while still offering you some very special deals. </div>
<div>The basic perk will be the called the <b>""Private""</b> perk and will ensure you one full copy of Panzer Clash, that is more than 430 cards for just $50 shipped right to your door (If you happen to be based in the US. We do apologize for higher pricing for EU and Canadian backers due to increased shipping fees!). But that is not all we will be offering you:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Firstly we have an</span><b style=""background-color: initial;""> ""Early Bird"" special deal</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> for you in store: The first 25 backers who pledge at the Private perk will receive their copy of Panzer Clash at a $10 USD discount, so if you act fast, you can get the full game for $40 USD shipped (provided you are in the US - international shipping will still be adding extra cost!). And if you are not quite so fast, there are also 25 copies of the game reserved for the first to grab them at a $5 USD discount (so the basic ""Private"" deal will cost you $45 USD - shipped within the US). </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Secondly, if you thought the regular Private deal itself was great, then get this: There will be a limited </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">""Private First Class""</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> perk that will ensure you a copy of the game PLUS the AWESOME </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Panzer Clash Official Soundtrack Audio CD AT NO ADDED COST FOR YOU</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. This deal is limited to 300 copies. The Soundtrack CD features a mighty line-up of metal bands from around the globe, big and small, popular and nearly unknown alike and is the perfect addition to anyone's heavy metal CD collection! The state-of the art Soundtrack CD does already exist and we have it readily in store. Here is some visual proof:</span><br/>

<ul><li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Besides the ""Private"" perks, we are especially pleased to offer you a truly unique, maybe even a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Did you ever want to be IN an actual game or did you maybe even want to see you as a proud and fearless Panzer General? Well we can make this real for you - if you decide to pledge for the </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">""General""</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> perk! At this prestigious pledge level, you will not only receive a Panzer Clash Goodies Package, but, most important and unique, we will have our talented artist Robert Treherne </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">paint you as a WW2 Panzer General, so your likeness will be on a card to be included in the finished game!! </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">And this is what YOU could look like in the game (the sample below <p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">depicts an actual, real life person!):</span><br/></p></span>

<ul><li>If for whatever reason you would want two copies of the game and also the CD, we can offer you that at the <b>""Sergeant""</b> and <b>""Staff Sergeant""</b> perks (Staff Sergenat includes the CD). So maybe you know a friend who might be happy about a gift like the Panzer Clash Game, consider backing as ""(Staff) Sergeant""!</li></ul>

<h4>we will have Stretch Goals!</h4>
<div>(For those who are new to crowdfunding projects: Stretch Goals are extra items or benefits for all backers for free if a certain number of overfunding is reached - so basically when we raise more money than necessary to meet the funding goal.)</div>
<div>But for this campaign we will be very sneaky about those and all I will say for now is that the <b>first Stretch Goal will be revealed and unlocked</b> and all backers will gain some exclusive bonus items at no further cost to them at all<b> at $14000 USD</b>. The Stretch Goals will be revealed once they are met. So if you are curious what we will have in store for you when we make an extra $1000 USD, do what you can to make this happen!</div>
<div>One more thing I will give away now: How about <b>Custom Card Sleeves</b> with an exclusive Panzer Clash design on the back? Wouldn't this be both awesome and useful to protect the cards in your decks from wear and tear? Anyways this will be not exactly cheap so expect this to be a high-end Stretch Goal. More info on this will be revealed soon, don't you worry!</div>

It is however recommended to just watch the Preview Video on the top of the page to get an idea of how the game actually works - it is up to you.</p>
<p>And for those who are curious about the rules of Panzer Clash in detail, here is the download link to the full rules! (It is just plain text as of now but the final product will contain a nicely designed, full color rules booklet. Also, the wording may still be subject to changes - mechanics and rules themselves WILL NOT). Here's the link:</p>
<p><b><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9klETLXkrcJc1RFWkM0ZHc1b00/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Panzer Clash Full Game Rules</a></b></p>
<p><b>In Panzer Clash, the goal of the game is to reduce the opponent ""Supply"" (their custom built deck of 60 or less cards) to zero cards by means of dealing damage through Units and Events. For each point of damage the opponent receives, they have to discard the topmost card from their Supply to their Junkyard (Discard Pile).</b></p>
<p><b>Is a player required to draw a card, for example during Draw-Phase, which occurs every turn, but cannot do so because their Supply is empty, they lose immediately.</b></p>
<p>In the Panzer Clash Base Game, which is what we are trying to raise funds for in this here campaign, there are <b>4 Factions</b> which are the four main actors in the terrible events of WW2, namely the Germans and Japanese (Axis) and the Americans and Soviets (Allies). Factions only matter in deckbuilding as you cannot mix Axis with Allies cards in one Deck, for reasons of historical accuracy of course! However there are also many, many neutral cards that are not associated with any Faction in particular and that can hence go into any deck.</p>
<p>Probably the most unique and innovative feature Panzer Clash has to offer when it comes to gameplay is the <b>Terrain Cards</b>. Unlike in your normal, everyday Customizable Card Game, in Panzer Clash you have a modular battlefield created at random before every single game, consisting of different Terrain Cards...</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/893251/files/20140930094611-Terrain_Card_Samples_Presentation.png?1412095571"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>...which may have positive or negative effects on the Units stationed on them, which adds a great amount of strategical depth and another, highly challenging and enjoyable tactical layer to the game. And what's more, the Terrain System also creates sort of a ""Fog of War"" situation, as Terrain cards are randomly placed face-down and only by moving a Unit there they are flipped face-up and you'll know if you get a bonus on movement as you hit a ""Main Road"" or your movement will be slowed down by some Mountains or Marshland for instance. Here is what the battlefield with the face-down Terrain cards would look like in a 2 player game:</p>

Here some samples for Unit cards:<p></p>

These Events have certain effects on the game and either affect you in a beneficial way like drawing extra cards for instance or are of harmful nature to your opponent. Here some samples:<p></p>

Here the samples:<p></p>

So the first 300 backers to grab this very special deal of us just giving away a kickass heavy metal audio CD - The Panzer Clash Official Soundtrack - on top of your copy of the Panzer Clash Card Game, will receive said CD along with the huge box of cards. Here some info on the Soundtrack:
</div>
<div>The Panzer Clash Official Soundtrack features a broad variety of bands, from really huge like Sabaton (Sweden), Hammerfall (Sweden) and Endstille (Germany) to small-scale, rather unknown and local, many of the latter being from my own home country Austria. The songs on this compilation all deal with the general subject of war or WW2 in particular and are a good mix from several Metal genres, from Black Metal over Trash and Death to Power Metal. Note that some of the smaller bands on the Soundtrack have written and performed songs ESPECIALLY for this exclusive Panzer Clash Soundtrack. Here's an example done by some friendly compatriots of mine - especially for this Soundtrack to emphasize it again:</div>

<h3>THANK YOU VERY MUCH for considering to back this project and/or for supporting it any other way within your powers!!</h3>
</div></div>","My name is Andreas Propst and I am a young, up and coming designer of board and card games (as well as artist, fledgling book author and much more that does not matter now...) from Austria, who has been designing games with great passion - more or less successfully - for about 7 years now. On this here Indiegogo fundraising campaign, I want to introduce you to my World War 2 themed, highly customizable but non-collectible card game PANZER CLASH!


Panzer Clash is an easy-to-pick-up yet highly strategic, fully customizable card game for 2 - 4 players (best with 2 players) all about Second World War Panzer Battles. What we are offering you is a huge box of no less than 430 cards (probably more depending on the success of this very campaign) which will serve as an extensive card pool for countless hours of deckbuilding madness, from which countless hours of highly enjoyable, actual gameplay will result. Panzer Clash features many great mechanics such as an unique resoure system and, best of all, a modular battlefield consisting of various Terrain types, on which you will be moving around your Units, that will be generated at random at the beginning of every game. So no game of Panzer Clash will be the same! More on the actual rules and gameplay later. Alternatively you can watch the video review above, know however that said review is based on an older ""incarnation"" of the game. Still it will give you an idea of how Panzer Clash is played and what makes it a great, deeply strategic and overall enjoyable gaming experience.
Through this here campaign I am trying to realize Panzer Clash, which I have carefully and relentlessly developed and refined over more than 5 years, with my ultimate goal being not to ""make the big buck"", but rather to spread the game among as many gamers as possible for the greatest pleasure for me derives from  the notion that many people enjoy what I created and are just having a good time with some friends playing Panzer Clash for instance. Hence all is priced for us to break even, not to maximize personal profits.
And this is where YOU come in, valued potential backer! Having a large print run of a 430+ cards game manufactured and shipped out to customers (that is you, the gamers)  entails immense costs which I could not by any means cover myself, and hence the need for this campaign and hence the need for your pledge!
Let us make Panzer Clash a reality - Together we are strong!!   

 By means of this fundraising campaign, I intend to fund the manufacturing and worldwide distribution of a minimum print run size of 500 Units (copies of the game), which is an immensely costly thing to do and hence I am asking for your pledge to realize the game. One man like myself cannot possibly fund a huge project like this on his own, but if many people make their relatively small contribution, even seemingly outrageous amounts of funds can be raised in order to make a project like Panzer Clash a reality - and such is the very nature of crowdfunding. So: Long story short, the money you pledge will go entirely into the manufacturing of the Panzer Clash Customizable Card Game and into sending it out to the backers from all over the world. So the bulk of the costs are twofold basically: Manufacturing / Printing costs and shipping fees.
Now to what everyone has been waiting for:
We are both pleased and proud to be able to offer you some very fair and also unique PERKS!
We tried to keep the different perks as simple as possible while still offering you some very special deals. 
The basic perk will be the called the ""Private"" perk and will ensure you one full copy of Panzer Clash, that is more than 430 cards for just $50 shipped right to your door (If you happen to be based in the US. We do apologize for higher pricing for EU and Canadian backers due to increased shipping fees!). But that is not all we will be offering you:


Firstly we have an ""Early Bird"" special deal for you in store: The first 25 backers who pledge at the Private perk will receive their copy of Panzer Clash at a $10 USD discount, so if you act fast, you can get the full game for $40 USD shipped (provided you are in the US - international shipping will still be adding extra cost!). And if you are not quite so fast, there are also 25 copies of the game reserved for the first to grab them at a $5 USD discount (so the basic ""Private"" deal will cost you $45 USD - shipped within the US). 


Secondly, if you thought the regular Private deal itself was great, then get this: There will be a limited ""Private First Class"" perk that will ensure you a copy of the game PLUS the AWESOME Panzer Clash Official Soundtrack Audio CD AT NO ADDED COST FOR YOU. This deal is limited to 300 copies. The Soundtrack CD features a mighty line-up of metal bands from around the globe, big and small, popular and nearly unknown alike and is the perfect addition to anyone's heavy metal CD collection! The state-of the art Soundtrack CD does already exist and we have it readily in store. Here is some visual proof:





Besides the ""Private"" perks, we are especially pleased to offer you a truly unique, maybe even a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Did you ever want to be IN an actual game or did you maybe even want to see you as a proud and fearless Panzer General? Well we can make this real for you - if you decide to pledge for the ""General"" perk! At this prestigious pledge level, you will not only receive a Panzer Clash Goodies Package, but, most important and unique, we will have our talented artist Robert Treherne paint you as a WW2 Panzer General, so your likeness will be on a card to be included in the finished game!! And this is what YOU could look like in the game (the sample below depicts an actual, real life person!):





If for whatever reason you would want two copies of the game and also the CD, we can offer you that at the ""Sergeant"" and ""Staff Sergeant"" perks (Staff Sergenat includes the CD). So maybe you know a friend who might be happy about a gift like the Panzer Clash Game, consider backing as ""(Staff) Sergeant""!
Besides the diverse and fair perks, we are happy to offer you custom printed 

Panzer Clash Fan Shirts 
as extra goodies you can ""purchase"" by adding $45 USD (worldwide shipping included) to your pledge. We got them in 4 awesome designs, one for each Faction so you can pick your favorite! Here they are for you:

As in every decent crowdfunding campaign, rest assured that 
we will have Stretch Goals!
(For those who are new to crowdfunding projects: Stretch Goals are extra items or benefits for all backers for free if a certain number of overfunding is reached - so basically when we raise more money than necessary to meet the funding goal.)
But for this campaign we will be very sneaky about those and all I will say for now is that the first Stretch Goal will be revealed and unlocked and all backers will gain some exclusive bonus items at no further cost to them at all at $14000 USD. The Stretch Goals will be revealed once they are met. So if you are curious what we will have in store for you when we make an extra $1000 USD, do what you can to make this happen!
One more thing I will give away now: How about Custom Card Sleeves with an exclusive Panzer Clash design on the back? Wouldn't this be both awesome and useful to protect the cards in your decks from wear and tear? Anyways this will be not exactly cheap so expect this to be a high-end Stretch Goal. More info on this will be revealed soon, don't you worry!
  
 Here, the basics of the game will be explained and we will treat you with some actual card samples for your viewing pleasure. It is however recommended to just watch the Preview Video on the top of the page to get an idea of how the game actually works - it is up to you.
And for those who are curious about the rules of Panzer Clash in detail, here is the download link to the full rules! (It is just plain text as of now but the final product will contain a nicely designed, full color rules booklet. Also, the wording may still be subject to changes - mechanics and rules themselves WILL NOT). Here's the link:
Panzer Clash Full Game Rules
In Panzer Clash, the goal of the game is to reduce the opponent ""Supply"" (their custom built deck of 60 or less cards) to zero cards by means of dealing damage through Units and Events. For each point of damage the opponent receives, they have to discard the topmost card from their Supply to their Junkyard (Discard Pile).
Is a player required to draw a card, for example during Draw-Phase, which occurs every turn, but cannot do so because their Supply is empty, they lose immediately.
In the Panzer Clash Base Game, which is what we are trying to raise funds for in this here campaign, there are 4 Factions which are the four main actors in the terrible events of WW2, namely the Germans and Japanese (Axis) and the Americans and Soviets (Allies). Factions only matter in deckbuilding as you cannot mix Axis with Allies cards in one Deck, for reasons of historical accuracy of course! However there are also many, many neutral cards that are not associated with any Faction in particular and that can hence go into any deck.
Probably the most unique and innovative feature Panzer Clash has to offer when it comes to gameplay is the Terrain Cards. Unlike in your normal, everyday Customizable Card Game, in Panzer Clash you have a modular battlefield created at random before every single game, consisting of different Terrain Cards...



...which may have positive or negative effects on the Units stationed on them, which adds a great amount of strategical depth and another, highly challenging and enjoyable tactical layer to the game. And what's more, the Terrain System also creates sort of a ""Fog of War"" situation, as Terrain cards are randomly placed face-down and only by moving a Unit there they are flipped face-up and you'll know if you get a bonus on movement as you hit a ""Main Road"" or your movement will be slowed down by some Mountains or Marshland for instance. Here is what the battlefield with the face-down Terrain cards would look like in a 2 player game:

On this battelfield you will be deploying your Units, which are built or recruited in your Factories, right behind your Back Line, and move them along on the different Terrain you will be discovering, with the ultimate goal of breaching the opponent lines of defense to reach their Back Line, from where your Units will be able to inflict damage to the opponent Supply/Deck directly. Here some samples for Unit cards:

Besides Units, you can unleash mighty Events that are also activated on your Factories (You will be stacking Factories in order to be able to afford higher cost Units and Events - costs range from 1 to 3). These Events have certain effects on the game and either affect you in a beneficial way like drawing extra cards for instance or are of harmful nature to your opponent. Here some samples:
Lastly, there are Terrain Modifier cards which do just what the name suggests: You put them on a face-up Terrain card and they will add certain abilities to the Terrain you placed the Modifier on. Here the samples:

And these are pretty much the basics of how a game of Panzer Clash is played. If you want to have a more in detail idea of the rules, just check them out on the link I gave above!Furthermore, if you are curious about the cards that will come with Your Panzer Clash ""Mega Pack"", you can actually take a look and check out ALL the cards included here (Minor changes in wording could or will happen!):Panzer Clash Full Visual Card Spoiler



So the first 300 backers to grab this very special deal of us just giving away a kickass heavy metal audio CD - The Panzer Clash Official Soundtrack - on top of your copy of the Panzer Clash Card Game, will receive said CD along with the huge box of cards. Here some info on the Soundtrack:

The Panzer Clash Official Soundtrack features a broad variety of bands, from really huge like Sabaton (Sweden), Hammerfall (Sweden) and Endstille (Germany) to small-scale, rather unknown and local, many of the latter being from my own home country Austria. The songs on this compilation all deal with the general subject of war or WW2 in particular and are a good mix from several Metal genres, from Black Metal over Trash and Death to Power Metal. Note that some of the smaller bands on the Soundtrack have written and performed songs ESPECIALLY for this exclusive Panzer Clash Soundtrack. Here's an example done by some friendly compatriots of mine - especially for this Soundtrack to emphasize it again:



In case you want to know the detailed line-up of tracks on the official Panzer Clash Soundtrack, here you have it:



  
  Panzer Clash has been around for more than 5 years now, being available in various previous incarnations. This means the game is ready and has been ready for printing and publishing for years now. We have all the art and visual assets readily available and all that is needed to realize the game and send it right to your door, dear potential backer, is the money we are trying to raise from this very Indiegogo campaign.
So you can expect and rest assured that there will not be any delays caused by further development of the game - no testing, tweaking, refining. All is ready and set for printing and distribution, which we intend to do ASAP after this campaign ended in successful funding. We will go out of our ways that your waiting time until you hold your copy of Panzer Clash in your hands will be reduced as far as possible for you.
Furthermore, as you have seen in the photo above, the Panzer Clash Soundtrack CD already exists in physical form, is licensed and everything, and in fact just sitting in a huge box in my basement, ready to be shipped to you, valued backer!!
Panzer Clash will be printed ""clean&green"" in the United States of America,
 by our trusted partner
Quality Playing Cards & Games, based in Orlando, Florida, USA.
Distribution of the games will be handled from the US as well through a trusted, long-term partner. This means there will be not much of a delay from printing to shipping all the games to our US-based partner to eventually shipping the product to you, the backer. 
As this whole project is operated from the United States pretty much, we do apologize for the increased pricing for Canadian and EU backers. We are sorry, but there is no way around costly international shipping fees!

<p>  Shipping <i>does</i> decrease of multiple decks are shipped to one address, however, and I have reflected this in the different pledge amount.</p>

<p>   In the event that something goes awry, I believe I have enough overhead to solve the issue, and provide for a replacement.</p>
<p>   Still, unexpected things can happen, and I will keep you all updated on what the latest developments are.  This is a joint effort, and I must do my part to let you all know how everything is faring.</p>

   With these two things being said, I will do my best to set goals that I can deliver, and set time frames I can deliver them by.
   In the event that something goes awry, I believe I have enough overhead to solve the issue, and provide for a replacement.
   Still, unexpected things can happen, and I will keep you all updated on what the latest developments are.  This is a joint effort, and I must do my part to let you all know how everything is faring.


 
Other Ways You Can Help:
   I understand not everyone can pitch in.  That's okay!  
   If you think this design is pretty excellent, I would be super excited if you could share this page with a friend or on a social network like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter!
   Every little bit and impression puts us a step closer to our goal!

<p><strong>- What are the risks and what are your guarantees?</strong></p>
<p>Up to this moment we have already created (made) the main core of the game (main gameplay), laid out more than thirty levels and almost finished working on the level that has the Boss. You don’t risk anything by supporting us, as the game is already on the stage of beta-testing. We guarantee that the game will be finished either way. Fundraising is necessary to speed up the development process and increase the amount and the quality of the content in the game.</p>
<p><strong>- Why does your company have the type “<i>Flexible</i>”?</strong></p>
<p>We really want to finish our game as soon as possible, and we need funds to do that. We wanted to let customers decide for themselves what quality of the game they would like to get. The more funds we can collect, the more rich and complete the game will be. We chose this type of company because we already have a working demo version and we received a great amount of positive feedback. In choosing this type we didn’t realise that it could scare away possible customers. Unfortunately, it’s not possible to change the type of the company now. We only hope that our fans and people who fall in love with the game, will help us reach our goal.</p>
<p><strong>- Who are you?</strong></p>
<p>We are a team of independent developers with freelancing experience, working in different fields for more than eight years. Both of us are artistic people, full of fresh ideas and desire to create.</p>
<p><strong>-Why have you decided to make this game?</strong></p>
<p>Working as freelancers for a long time, we amassed lots of our own ideas that we would like to bring to life. We believe that making and playing games is one of the best ways to express yourself.</p>
<p><strong>- For how long have you been working as a team?</strong></p>
<p>Our team was created a bit over six months ago for work on this and other projects. It consists of like-minded people who aspire to make good and unique products.</p>
<p><strong>- Why $50,000 specifically?</strong></p>
<p>$50,000$ is an optimal amount that will let us finish the game and make it as rich and complete as possible. If we gather less funds than this, the game will still be finished, however, part of the story and ideas would have to be sold separately as DLC (additions) to the game. We would prefer to avoid that. If you help us to make the necessary amount, we guarantee that all bonus features and upgrades will be added for free.</p>
<p><strong>- Why would I donate the money?</strong></p>
<p>The number of truly interesting and high-quality games decreases every year. It’s especially true with regard to the Indie genre. Our main goal is to make interesting games of high quality which most people would like. If you want to support the future of the game industry, please help us to gather the necessary funds. We promise that we will do our best to help the game industry evolve.</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Bogdan Sheliakin. I represent Alien Prism, an independent studio of game developers. At the moment we have two people in our team. Nikita Tulinov is an artist works on the main part of the visual content. My job is programming – bringing the graphical elements created by Nikita to life. We’ve put lots of time and effort to make our dreams come true and now we want to introduce to you our game Mad Manuel.</p>

<p>We like to play games a lot. We both believe that the more complicated a game is the more interesting it is to complete it. Many hours spent on trying to complete “Boss”, the joy of completing every new level, the beaten to death keyboard – these all are the criteria for any good game. That’s why we decided to create a game that would make a gamer cry trying to complete every new unbelievably difficult level and laugh from the joy of completing it. We took old-school difficulty, covered it in an unusual visual style and enhanced it with the use of comical stereotypes.</p>
<p>This is how our project was born.</p>

<p>I would like to tell you a bit about the way we work. The game detail is a result of our joint effort and imagination. At the moment we both have other jobs apart from game developing. We use Skype in the evening to discuss all ideas that come to mind during the day. Then we share our day’s achievements and get to work.</p>
<p>Based on our ideas Nikita creates preliminary sketches, which we will discuss later. The sketches are then loaded into the project where I begin my magic. After deciding what a particular object will be used for in a game, I start programming. Each object has to be checked hundreds of times to make sure it looks and works the way it supposed to. When all the elements are ready we start developing levels, in which the objects will be placed. When several layers are ready, I start putting the project together. Each of us checks the functionality of layers and elements and makes sure that the game works overall. We do necessary adjustments and start the process again.</p>

<p>Alien Prism Studio is in the beginning of its way. However, each of us have been growing in different directions for more than 8 years. We both took part in different projects. We have plenty of interesting ideas which we would like to live out in the future.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div><h3>What is ""The Darkest Hour""?</h3></div><div>
<p>""The Darkest Hour"" is a 2D platformer, but with nice graphics and RPG elements. Formulating concept of the game we guided ourselves with 2 main ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li> We want create a game, that we would play with great pleasure ourselves.</li>
<li> We take only the best things from our favorite genres.</li>
</ol>
<p>We carefully created all aspects of our game. But most of all we concentrated on two of them - gameplay and talents system. There is a NON-class Hero evolution in ""The Darkest Hour"" with two talents systems.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523415715/vbo9qy8vdpwxbvklofhp.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523415746/jnnyiprunfkj1x4qurwl.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>One of them has a lot of powerful active and passive abilities. There seven schools in this system: melee combat, Fire, Water, Air, Death, Life (coming soon) and Earth (coming soon). You may use abilities from all of this schools at once creating great COMBOs and specializations. There is a small example. You can take water bolt with AOE splashes, that will apply debaff ""Drench"" on enemies. Then take ""Ball Lightning"", AOE spell that has always critical effect on enemies with ""Drench"". You may also take ""Ice ball"", AOE ability that deals double damage to enemies with ""Drench"" and dispels this debaff freezing them (frozen enemies always take critical damage from physical abilities). Finally, you may want to take physical ability ""Spiritual charge"" to deal critical damage to all the frozen monsters and a passive ability ""Bloody wounds"" that applies a powerful DoT on those who took critical physical damage from you. It looks like nice COMBO, isn't it? And there are much more in ""The Darkest Hour""! But you can take no more then 16 abilities from this system. So, choose them carefully. All your active abilities will be shown on the command panel.</p>
<p>Second system simply upgrades your characteristics: health, armor, strength, intellect, passive energy regeneration, haste (reduces cooldowns of abilities), critical chance and critical damage. Some of this characteristics becomes extremely helpful with one set of abilities and useless with another set.</p>
<p>Energy management is also important. You have small passive regeneration, but most of your powerful abilities spend a lot of energy. So you have to use your spells properly, use special passive talents. But sometimes this is not enough. So, you will have a talent to regenerate lots of energy points with melee strikes and ""Spiritual charge"".</p>
<h3>What about story?</h3>
<p>Indeed, any good game must have a good plot. We want players to learn the story gradually from dialogs and books. Each of significant characters will have its own story. This stories you can find in hidden books in different locations. But, probably, you want to find out what is the world of ""The Darkest Hour"" about in general... We will try to explain you everything briefly.</p>
<p>So, mysterious ancient demiurges created the planet and started to spread life on it. But their antagonists, the chaos lords, distorted the process of creation life and so, the first living creatures became bloodthirsty aberrations empowered by Chaos, which mortals will name demons later. To help them eradicate this threat demiurges created a second race - humans. They granted them mind and tought them primitive magic spells. Together, gods and humans destroyed the demons and imprisoned remaining aberrations in another realm.</p>
<p>After the war, demiurges granted a great power to the 5 greatest human warriors. And then, the gods left this world. This warriors became Guardians and their main purposes were to protect the world from the evil and keep peace. The Guardians' previous names are long forgotten. Their new names became Strength, Wisdom, Mercy, Balance and Justice. But, one day Justice betrayed his brothers and sisters. He released demons, captured his former friends and attacked united human kingdom of Primehold. That day Justice became Vengeance.</p>
<p>Our hero was commander of the elite king's guards in Primehold. He failed to protect his king, the capital and his people. Vengeance destroyed his homeland. The hero couldn't take this shame and burnt his violet cloak of elite guard and a mark of commander. He started his journey to find solvation...</p>

</div><p>If you have any questions send us an email to ChaosGaming@yandex.ru</p><p>Thanks for help! :)</p></div>","What is ""The Darkest Hour""?
""The Darkest Hour"" is a 2D platformer, but with nice graphics and RPG elements. Formulating concept of the game we guided ourselves with 2 main ideas:

 We want create a game, that we would play with great pleasure ourselves.
 We take only the best things from our favorite genres.

We carefully created all aspects of our game. But most of all we concentrated on two of them - gameplay and talents system. There is a NON-class Hero evolution in ""The Darkest Hour"" with two talents systems.


One of them has a lot of powerful active and passive abilities. There seven schools in this system: melee combat, Fire, Water, Air, Death, Life (coming soon) and Earth (coming soon). You may use abilities from all of this schools at once creating great COMBOs and specializations. There is a small example. You can take water bolt with AOE splashes, that will apply debaff ""Drench"" on enemies. Then take ""Ball Lightning"", AOE spell that has always critical effect on enemies with ""Drench"". You may also take ""Ice ball"", AOE ability that deals double damage to enemies with ""Drench"" and dispels this debaff freezing them (frozen enemies always take critical damage from physical abilities). Finally, you may want to take physical ability ""Spiritual charge"" to deal critical damage to all the frozen monsters and a passive ability ""Bloody wounds"" that applies a powerful DoT on those who took critical physical damage from you. It looks like nice COMBO, isn't it? And there are much more in ""The Darkest Hour""! But you can take no more then 16 abilities from this system. So, choose them carefully. All your active abilities will be shown on the command panel.
Second system simply upgrades your characteristics: health, armor, strength, intellect, passive energy regeneration, haste (reduces cooldowns of abilities), critical chance and critical damage. Some of this characteristics becomes extremely helpful with one set of abilities and useless with another set.
Energy management is also important. You have small passive regeneration, but most of your powerful abilities spend a lot of energy. So you have to use your spells properly, use special passive talents. But sometimes this is not enough. So, you will have a talent to regenerate lots of energy points with melee strikes and ""Spiritual charge"".
What about story?
Indeed, any good game must have a good plot. We want players to learn the story gradually from dialogs and books. Each of significant characters will have its own story. This stories you can find in hidden books in different locations. But, probably, you want to find out what is the world of ""The Darkest Hour"" about in general... We will try to explain you everything briefly.
So, mysterious ancient demiurges created the planet and started to spread life on it. But their antagonists, the chaos lords, distorted the process of creation life and so, the first living creatures became bloodthirsty aberrations empowered by Chaos, which mortals will name demons later. To help them eradicate this threat demiurges created a second race - humans. They granted them mind and tought them primitive magic spells. Together, gods and humans destroyed the demons and imprisoned remaining aberrations in another realm.
After the war, demiurges granted a great power to the 5 greatest human warriors. And then, the gods left this world. This warriors became Guardians and their main purposes were to protect the world from the evil and keep peace. The Guardians' previous names are long forgotten. Their new names became Strength, Wisdom, Mercy, Balance and Justice. But, one day Justice betrayed his brothers and sisters. He released demons, captured his former friends and attacked united human kingdom of Primehold. That day Justice became Vengeance.
Our hero was commander of the elite king's guards in Primehold. He failed to protect his king, the capital and his people. Vengeance destroyed his homeland. The hero couldn't take this shame and burnt his violet cloak of elite guard and a mark of commander. He started his journey to find solvation...

<h3>Short Summary</h3>Our vision of a game we want to create.<p>This game allows a player to plunge into the colorful and mysterious underwater world of microorganisms. Your character is a microbe that fights for food and survives in the unfriendly world of the same greedy and even aggressively minded microbes. ""Eat or be eaten"" - this is the main principle which rules everything and everyone here.</p>
<p>One of the main features of this world is the colorful diversity of its inhabitants. Thanks to the extremely flexible editor of the character it is possible to change the body shape, color, and texture.   </p>
<p>The microbe has the basic shape and the parts that have passive and active effects, which add greatly to the underwater battles variety and action. The world is filled with living organisms that are guided by artificial intelligence. Be ready to have a large number of obstacles on your way: the food is hard to hunt down and the predatory bosses do not give any opportunity to relax even for the strongest players.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm George Keel! I've been a game dev for about 6 years now, and have helped in small projects with friends. This is a game I wanna work on to convert my creativity into something useful. I want more people to realize what Autism actually is, and I want to put my experiences into something others can see. I was diagnosed at age 10, and it's been a journey, one that I want to make into an interactive game!</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Here's the good stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>The funding is going into hardware, such as the headsets, and the assets and licenses and Steam Greenlight fees needed to actually make this real!</li>
<li>Some perks to helping - You get immediate access to the game, and possibly some merch!</li>
<li>If I don't reach my goal, I'm still going to try to develop the game, but I just don't know if I can without the funding.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> I feel making this game will help bring a spotlight in the gaming community to Autism and some other mental health issues.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This will be my first VR game! I have played around with the tools a bunch and I feel I am skilled enough to make a full fledged game for both the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. I will eventually get involved with a team to help, but right now it is solo.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>SHARE SHARE SHARE! If you can't donate, spread the word about the project! It'll make a big difference whether it falls short or passes the bar!</div></div>","Short Summary

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Queenship's team represents a variety of skills and backgrounds, including video game composition, concept art, narrative writing, game engines, and a variety of other skills essential to successful game development. We are intent on making a positive impact in the area of mental health and making the discussion of mental health, illness, and disorders more public, more accessible, and more widely accepted. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is what your funding will be paying for:<br/><br/>-research and consultation with mental health professionals<br/>-work hours<br/>-copyright filings + other legal paperwork<br/>-marketing and research<br/><br/>What you get: check out our perks section! Additionally, the satisfaction of knowing you've helped a community-minded studio get off the ground. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our first game, Open Spaces, is a visual novel about anxiety and agoraphobia. We are concurrently working on a mobile app, Return to Self, that we hope will help users manage anxiety and panic disorders and attacks. On our concept roster are House of Echoes, a game about hallucinations, and Gravewood, an RPG about depression. </p>
<p>Our goal is to produce gamified tools that may assist sufferers in understanding their symptoms better - and help their families, friends, and communities offer them the support they need more effectively.<br/><br/>In addition, the positive impact we think that the development of Queenship will have on other female game developers cannot be overstated. Our aim is to produce amazing games and encourage other people underrepresented in game development to do the same. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The clear and present risk is that we won't be able to bring our games as effectively to market as we'd like - a challenge every game studio faces. But with your help, we can work to more adequately showcase and market our games and help lots and lots of people. </p>

""I love it! Super stylish, and with a sense of humor drier than a 7% IPA!""— Josh Mandel, writer and designer of  Space Quest 6 and Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded

""Game looks great!""— Charles Cecil, creator of the Broken Sword Series and Beneath a Steel Sky
""Sebastian Frank: The Beer Hall Putsch is a refreshing take on the adventure game genre. They have done a great job crafting a unique game inspired by historic events""

— John Passfield, creator of Flight of the Amazon Queen




The German nation is economically devastated, as it is forced to pay incredibly sizeable reparations to France and Great Britain. These economical and social circumstances determine how the society behaves. The union is unstable and the times are tumultuous as people become increasingly divided by their convictions.A movement called NSDAP (Socialist German Workers' Party) with the working class electorate is exerting pressure on the Weimar Republic. An Austrian born figure is rapidly and skillfully increasing his influence in the party and in the German Society. His name is Adolf Hitler.Despite his influence, not everyone is convinced. Sebastian Frank knows Hitler better than most of the people. He first met Hitler in Vienna in 1908 when they both applied to study at the Vienna’s Academy of Fine Arts. Later they served Germany together in WWI. Sebastian has great influence in a counter movement that is trying to prevent Hitler from seizing power.He and his fellowship find Hitler’s ideas threatening and dangerous to the nation and the world and are determined to stop him!




The game has more than 40 colourful and engaging characters. Sebastian Frank, Stephanie Kiss and S. Hafner together, strengthen the movement trying to put an end to Hitler’s strive for rise to power.

The player controls the main character, Sebastian, on this quest.



Sebastian Frank: the Beer Hall Putsch is a Point and Click Adventure Game inspired by the classics. The player has to guide the character throughout a series of puzzles which involve exploration, picking up and combining objects and interacting with other characters.

</span></div>","OddGames
is a one man game studio currently developing a PC game called Medieval Story. I live in Umeå, a town in northern Sweden.There is a Medieval Story working alpha demo which you can try for free. However, to get the project finished I need your support. This will allow me to pay for studio rent, additional development programs and equipment.The more I raise the more creative freedom and content there will be.Your funding support will help!
Medieval Story takes place in an open world. Once you are on the road you are free to
explore the land. This means that you can have multiple quests going on at the same time and that they don’t have to be completed in a predefined order. It is up to the player to decide their own pace of gameplay and preferred path of exploration.
Some of the
game’s details:The game is
built using an in-house isometric engine. Graphics, music and sound effects are
especially created for the game, no assets have been bought or licensed.

 
The combat elements
in the game are directly controlled by the player. Every attack and parry/block
has to be executed explicitly. The game is not centered on experience points or
some random loot system. Instead the player’s skill and the quality of the gear
that is earned determines the outcome of a battle.
Medieval
Story has been in development for several years by a one man team. The game’s
core code is mostly completed. It is possible to run around, fight NPC, engage
in dialogue etc. However some minor systems are still in need of implementation
such as cut scene functionality.The game is going to be episode based. The more money that is raised 
beyond the initial goal the more content there will be.$10 000 - Initial goal. This will allow me to complete the game with one full episode. $20 000 - Stretch goal #1. If the campaign reaches this amount I will have enough funding for one more episode.$30 000 - Stretch goal #2. With
 this amount I will be able to add even more content. More monsters, 
locations, music, cut scenes than was previously planned for.$40 000 - Stretch goal #3. If the campaign reaches this amount I will be able to further develop the level editor (Nimrod the isometric
editor) and release it to the public, for free!$50 000 - Stretch goal #4. Additional platform support (to be determined). Play Medieval Story on your favourite gaming platform!You can already play a short introduction to the first episode by downloading the alpha test! 

My name is
Daniel Olofsson and I have been programming games and created digital graphics
for the past 20 years. I have developed games for several different platforms
and environments including Windows, IOS, internet/web, Java and Amiga.I started
programming the engine that Medieval Story utilizes as a hobby diversion in my spare
time.

Every
donation will help to make this game a reality. You will have my sincerest
gratitude.

<p><img alt=""Introduction"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://spellshifter.com/indiegogo/introduction.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Introduction""/></p>
<p>In its design, Spellshifter reminds of classic platformer games.  Primarily, we chose this kind of appearance because we like it. Our childhoods’ significant elements were the Commodore (C64, C Plus/4) games, which influenced us to become what we are now. We would like to create a game we ourselves would want to play with as well.</p>
<p>The game style could be defined by the mixtured medley of platformer, side-scrolling, upgrading, discovering and logical features. According to our plans, the latter one will be the dominant, which will keep the player in constant playing, since there will be vast numbers of puzzles during the game which must be solved in order to proceed. Between the puzzles, we can complete different missions which may reward us with precious items.</p>

<h2><img alt=""The story"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://spellshifter.com/indiegogo/thestory.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-size: 1.5em;"" title=""The story""/></h2>
<p>Our story begins with an ordinary hike on an ordinary day. In the mountains, an ordinary young man is playing ball with his absolutely ordinary plush teddy panda. It’s surely absolutely ordinary stuff so far. But their delightful leisure is disturbed by a – maybe not so – natural phenomenon which perfuses the mountain with blinding light within a blink of an eye and deprives our hero of his most precious value – his consciousness.</p>
<p>As a result of this short but meaningful – and of course we keep emphasize that absolutely ordinary – event, our pixel hero loses his best friend, who he has been knowing from the moment his favourite psychiatrist introduced them to each other. So, not wasting thoughts on what to do, he sets out for a journey to find his plush teddy panda. But the short seeking trip later becomes a long – and we might say an absolutely ordinary – adventure.</p>

<h2><img alt=""Spells and puzzles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://spellshifter.com/indiegogo/spells.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Spells and puzzles""/></h2>
<p>During the game, there are lots of missions ahead to complete in order to find out where we can find the world’s surely best ace panda. Of course, it would not be an adventure if there wasn’t at least one special spell which surely comes in handy when a man is facing a seemingly insolvable problem (and we will). To the great grief of the harder and harder puzzles, our pixel character will possess many spells of the special kind, which the player could constantly upgrade during the game. </p>
<div>
<p>The curiosity of Spellshifter is that many of the puzzles have more possible solutions.  Not always the simplest way is the best: the game may reward more resourceful solutions with precious items. </p>

<h2><img alt=""Graphics and atmosphere"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://spellshifter.com/indiegogo/graphics.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Graphics and atmosphere""/></h2>
<p>We put a great emphasis on the atmosphere, therefore, we try to make the levels, environments and the surroundings really unique to make the discovery of the world a really joyful and exciting experience. We can play in different periods of day and night, travel the world in different weather conditions and some of the elements of the environment will react to our dynamic wind system.

With a little (actually big) help from fellow developers we'll be able to release the game on IOS, ANDROID and PC platforms at the same time!
If you contribute with THE ADVENTURER PERK or ABOVE, you'll have an option to choose which platform you want to receive the game on. After the contribution, send us an e-mail at eastpunkgames@gmail.com with the chosen platform. That's all! 
This is an all or nothing campaign! 
We won't be able to finish Spellshifter if we do not receive the funds needed!

In its design, Spellshifter reminds of classic platformer games.  Primarily, we chose this kind of appearance because we like it. Our childhoods’ significant elements were the Commodore (C64, C Plus/4) games, which influenced us to become what we are now. We would like to create a game we ourselves would want to play with as well.
The game style could be defined by the mixtured medley of platformer, side-scrolling, upgrading, discovering and logical features. According to our plans, the latter one will be the dominant, which will keep the player in constant playing, since there will be vast numbers of puzzles during the game which must be solved in order to proceed. Between the puzzles, we can complete different missions which may reward us with precious items.



Our story begins with an ordinary hike on an ordinary day. In the mountains, an ordinary young man is playing ball with his absolutely ordinary plush teddy panda. It’s surely absolutely ordinary stuff so far. But their delightful leisure is disturbed by a – maybe not so – natural phenomenon which perfuses the mountain with blinding light within a blink of an eye and deprives our hero of his most precious value – his consciousness.
As a result of this short but meaningful – and of course we keep emphasize that absolutely ordinary – event, our pixel hero loses his best friend, who he has been knowing from the moment his favourite psychiatrist introduced them to each other. So, not wasting thoughts on what to do, he sets out for a journey to find his plush teddy panda. But the short seeking trip later becomes a long – and we might say an absolutely ordinary – adventure.



During the game, there are lots of missions ahead to complete in order to find out where we can find the world’s surely best ace panda. Of course, it would not be an adventure if there wasn’t at least one special spell which surely comes in handy when a man is facing a seemingly insolvable problem (and we will). To the great grief of the harder and harder puzzles, our pixel character will possess many spells of the special kind, which the player could constantly upgrade during the game. 

The curiosity of Spellshifter is that many of the puzzles have more possible solutions.  Not always the simplest way is the best: the game may reward more resourceful solutions with precious items. 

Character animations

We put a great emphasis on the atmosphere, therefore, we try to make the levels, environments and the surroundings really unique to make the discovery of the world a really joyful and exciting experience. We can play in different periods of day and night, travel the world in different weather conditions and some of the elements of the environment will react to our dynamic wind system. We will easily identify our main character’s change of mood in different moments by his facial expressions making us able to understand his thoughts without a word in the given situation.

The world is being rebuilt after a war and from its rubble rises a new order - UTG - United Terran Government, unifying the whole globe and setting a new, common goal for the mankind. Thanks to the advancements in robotics, nanotechnology and bioengineering, the society reached a higher level of existence - over 94% of citizens of the Earth use enhanced prosthetics or is permanently connected to the global network thanks to telecommunication implants. The implants are a product of Providers - constantly competing with each other megacorporations that supply, install and update various implants in exchange for life-long subscription. In a world without borders they decide what's good or evil, and the one which is above competition is always right. Welcome to the future, where the worth of a human life is equivalent to an average monthly salary and where corporate espionage is the new form of warfare. Have you picked your Provider yet?</i></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507137480/vexwotmtwj9cjpppjm1g.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>We would like to start off by saying a few words about Coma's stage in its life cycle.</p><p>The project is still in very early stages of development. The goal of this campaign is to kick-start the real development of any missing core systems, build upon those that already are in place and to hire artists and coders that will help us realize this project in a timely manner. It is not to show off nearly finished product, as a marketing tool or to gauge interest for potential investors.</p><p>There are a number of features and systems having necessary scripting implemented, but they are not accessible by the player in the current build. Some systems are not yet decided upon, and have multiple versions that we consider leaving as a final one (for example: we currently have 3 versions of targeting - traditional 8-way targeting tied to movement, a lock-on system that is independent of character's movement and direction, and a completely free, 360-degree gun rotation, à la twin stick shooter games). Some of the features are done, but are using placeholders - like most of current animations - while some are completely missing. There are no real enemies in the game yet. Designing them with their moveset, animating and scripting their AI will take a substantial amount of time.</p><p>With that said, we hope after you read the campaign page you will see the potential of Coma. We encourage you to download the prototype and judge for yourself if it's worth investing in a project that's this early in its life.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509655964/ef7h0ax4vuti1maxg5ka.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>If the funding goal of the campaign is reached, the game will consist of 7 distinct locations or areas, each having 2 new enemy types. That excludes any variations of the enemies encountered in previous locations, since the bulk of the work, such as artwork, animation, behavioral scripting will have been already done.</p><p>Due to the complexity of the bosses themselves, and due to the fact the fights are going to be designed with a multi-angle approach in mind, the cost of each individual boss encounter is proportionally higher. We know that boss fights are high points for players to test the skills and strategies they mastered, as well as the gear they acquired. However we feel we need to limit the amount of these encounters in order to keep the base cost to a minimum and add them as the stretch goals are unlocked.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509656026/zfc77swtuzvl1xnknnhj.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Below you can find a description of each stretch goal:</p><ul>

Play as a member of an elite squad on a payroll of one of the Megacorporations, explore industrialized districts to find hidden, optional areas; fight with competition's mercenaries using your arsenal of weapons and unique abilities. Customize your character using multitude of passive and active implants, acquire new combat abilities and upgrade those already owned.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Main Features</h2><ul>
<li><p>Discover a dark cyberpunk world, inspired by the biggest classics of the genre, presented with beautiful hand-drawn sprites and backgrounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple playstyles. Do you like fighting defensively or offensively? Do you prefer hand-to-hand combat or destroying opponents from afar is your cup of tea? Or perhaps instead of fighting it’s better to take control of enemy systems and machines to do your dirty work for you? Agents of corporate special forces are prepared to fight in all conditions with any means.</p></li>
<li><p>Customize your character - utilize a wide range of specialized passive and active implants to tailor the playstyle to your needs. Enhanced strength, speed, special vision filters - bleeding edge tech is at your disposal and on the house. Utilizing every advantage over your competition is mandatory in your line of work. Just remember not to overindulge in your artificial self-improvement. There’s a fine line between a human and a machine, if that’s your concern.</p></li>
<li><p>Variety of Abilities - acquire new abilities that will help you reach previously inaccessible areas to discover secrets and most importantly - grant you new combat moves. Remember, some of the abilities will be hidden, and getting them will be optional. It is only up to you how many of them will be in your arsenal.</p></li>
<li><p>Co-op - each agent is an expert in their field of work, wreaking havoc among the competition. Imagine the synergy between them and level of destruction if there were two of them sent on a single mission. (Stretch goal)</p></li>

A scientist formerly working for the Abrams corp. claims he has information about new tech developed in absolute secrecy and he’s willing to negotiate the price of that information.</p><p>Chairman Gerhard Keller along with the board of directors decided to look into the matter. The chief of Exorno’s “Security Division”, gen. Stanley Vincent received an order to mobilize the special response unit. The objective is simple - contact dr Molière, verify the authenticity of the information and escort him to the extraction zone.

Personal data, credit and medical history and most importantly Global Information Network access - all available through the use of a single implant. The installation surgeries are expensive, additionally the implants need to be regularly replaced or upgraded to newer standards, and there are special drugs that need to be taken to avoid rejection. Not to mention a multitude of hidden additional maintenance and operational fees. Because of this the Providers ensure comprehensive implant servicing in exchange for lifetime subscription, effectively enslaving their customers.</p><p>In this world the fight for the customer is effectively fight for power and any competition is a sworn enemy.

On the other hand, progressing in the story may render current quests not finishable (for example, one of the sidequests may require gathering some data off a mainframe in a certain location but you destroyed the mainframe or the power source, and now you can't complete the quest). That said, Coma is not designed as a full-blown action RPG, with multiple branching paths in the main story and sidequests.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495147868/gg19o89xpuqb8mx4bwgt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Upgrades</h3>
<p>During exploration you will come across various upgrades. Upgrades are pieces of equipment granting the characters new abilities (or expanding those already obtained) used for level traversing and in combat. Some of the upgrades are character-specific, some of them are optional and acquiring them will help you find secret pathways and areas or help you with disposing of your opponents.</p>
<p>Upgrade examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>EMP - Disrupt or disable enemies’ optical cammo, find hidden paths obscured by holographic projections.</p></li>
<li><p>Combat Hacking Module - take control over enemy drones and defense systems and turn them against your opponents.</p></li>
<li><p>Vision Enhancement - enemies using optical camouflage or hidden in the dark won’t surprise you anymore.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Implants</h3>
<p>One of main advantages of being a cyborg is the ability of installing various implants.</p>
<p>Implants are completely optional character enhancements that can add or modify already owned abilities, allowing to create many, sometimes vastly different variants of the same character, tailored to your playstyle.</p>
<p>Do you find yourself taking too much damage because you like to go all in? Consider installing a medical implant which will slowly regenerate your life. Do you have a problem with hitting certain enemy? Smart lock-on will take care of it for you. Experiment with different implant combinations to make the character truly unique.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492584148/rzgegzrf7hfxgqkjpq4i.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>The combat is one of critical elements in Coma. We want to design a combat system that’s highly dynamic, where every skirmish feels fast and snappy, the character obeys every input, while maintaining the illusion of weight and impact to the most devastating attacks.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Mobility</h2>
<p>We want to put a heavy emphasis on mobility and versatility in combat. The player will be able to react to enemy attacks using various methods of basic and advanced controls. Apart from the fundamental movement, such as running, jumping, crouching, the player will have access to advanced movement techniques such as dashing, dodging or blocking. They can be used in combination with the directional controls, vastly modifying the performed move. Those advanced techniques will be granted by upgrades found during the exploration, and can be further enhanced to add various effects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494982055/phlbsfd9bnoo4bt4i8ko.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Firearms</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495687098/gih973z7d5rv6aqkhvph.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The primary means of combat in Coma are firearms. However, we want to make sure the combat is not boring and tedious. To achieve that, different enemies will be vulnerable to different types of ammunition.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495687067/ylltwykcz2rlhnl95gtv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Some enemies will have multiple defensive ‘layers’, such as heavy armor or energy barriers, which you will have to peel away. While fighting heavy-armored foes you will have to use armor-piercing ammo to strip them of their armor first, and then finish them off with the standard projectiles.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495687081/t7ucolptpclbqaoppqfi.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Furthermore, we want to encourage the player to use close-quarters-combat. While fighting against enemies utilizing multiple defences described above, after destroying one of the layers, the enemy will enter a dazed state, which you can utilize to your advantage by performing a melee move that will permanently disable each type of defense. Otherwise there is a chance the enemy will recover that particular defensive measure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495161324/paumsq5j9t1kivmh4c4s.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Further incentive will be in form of recovering a part of lost health or energy after performing those powerful attacks.</p>
<p>We plan for each character to have a weapon unique to them, ensuring you can pick your favorite fighting style based on fire rate, range, knockback, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Abilities</h2>
<p>Ranged and melee combat are fun, but being a cyborg brings much more to the table. Thanks to various combat implants you will be able to do much more. Hack an enemy exoskeleton to wreak havoc, use thermo-optical camouflage, hack enemy cyber implants to confuse them or hinder their abilities. Use everything in your disposal to defeat forces of your competition.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Energy</h2>
<p>One of main resources you will need to manage, besides your health, will be energy.</p>
<p>Each additional passive implant will decrease the amount of available energy. Whereas every active implant will use up the energy at a constant rate when activated.</p>
<p>Additionally, your abilities will also use up your energy, so maintaining a balance between a number of installed and activated implants will be crucial to your success.</p>
<p>There will also be different ways to regain your lost energy. It will automatically recover over time, performing a melee finishing move on your opponents will replenish a substantial portion of it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Enemies</h2>
<p>There are many opponents that will stand in your way. Automated defense systems, cybernetically enhanced mercenaries or heavily armored combat vehicles. Your competition doesn’t like unwanted guests and will try to dispose of you by any means necessary.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507505232/u57px6xu6vdplnoqfxs4.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Remember, your enemies are also equipped with the latest military-grade tech and will utilize every advantage against you. Their arsenal consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>optical/thermal camouflage</li>
<li>combat exosuits</li>
<li>hacking implants</li>
<li>frag, stun, EMP grenades</li>
</ul>
<p>and many more, requiring a different approach to every skirmish.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Bosses</h2>
<p>While exploring the world of Coma you will face powerful boss enemies. They will range from AI-operated systems, through fierce mercenary commanders, to military vehicles, such as battle tanks.</p>
<p>Each Boss fight will be meticulously designed to offer the right amount of challenge and put your skills to the test. Some of the bosses will have multiple stages, where they will use more and more deadly attacks or become faster, shortening your reaction window.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506912077/ryrmxfbzxreqexibzwqd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You will be able to defeat them in couple of ways, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>direct combat - well timed evasive maneuvers and quick thinking will allow you to face the boss face to face</li>
<li>utilizing environmental elements - lure the boss to a hazardous zone dealing massive damage, destroy sources of light making yourself harder to hit, hack and take control of defense systems forcing the boss to split their focus, and more</li>
<li>exploit their weaknesses - e.g. destroy targeting systems on an enemy machine to make their attacks less effective</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Hacking</h2>
<p>What would a world set in a cyberpunk reality be without some good 'ol hacking?</p>
<p>Cyber warfare, while being one of the crucial parts of Coma's combat and exploration, it will be totally optional.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Combat Hacking</h3>
<p>Characters equipped with a combat hacking implant will be able to take control over enemy drones, defense systems and disrupt other cybernetically enhanced adversaries, or even make them fight on their side for a short period of time.</p>
<p>Higher tiers of the hacking implant will allow the player to hack multiple enemies at the same time, or even perform a powerful burst hack, that will affect everything in a radius around the character.</p>
<p>While fighting bosses, it may be beneficial to disrupt their targeting systems, disable the most devastating weapons or hack part of the level itself to open a new path in order to exploit their weak points more effectively.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Hacking While Exploring</h3>
<p>Hacking will be a great source to obtain new intel about forces you're fighting with, get access to previously closed paths, or get some top-secret information. That information may be valuable both to your employers or to some 3rd party that's also interested in your work.</p>
<p>In contrast to combat hacking that lets the player instantly take over enemy systems in exchange for energy, we want the ""exploration hacking"" to be more involved. However, we would like to avoid making a simple minigame that leaves you with just the taste. We would like to create a cyberspace where the character gets ""transported"" and is represented by their avatar, where they have to face various obstacles and challenges. Failing those challenges or getting detected will trigger defensive countermeasures. In this cyberspace the character will still be controlled like normal, but will have a different skillset and equipment. You can think of it as something similar to Shadowrun's cyber combat, where a character is represented by a powerful avatar, facing manifestations of different firewalls, defensive subroutines and tracking programs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492584268/sabzvqjfhpcn4nd5bonq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Engine</h2>
<p>In its core, Coma uses Unity engine. We chose it for this project due to several reasons. First and foremost, our team had previous experience in working with it, which is a great advantage, since we know the engine’s strengths and shortcomings.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://light-echo.pl/images/indiegogo/2d-3d-3.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Unity offers great support for 2D and 3D objects out of the box, allowing us to mix and match various elements on the scene to achieve the look we want.</p>
<p>Due to its versatility, Unity can be easily expanded or modified to support new features, building on its core.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Environments</h2>
<p>We want all the areas in Coma to be represented by beautiful, hand-crafted artwork along with real-time, atmospheric in-engine lighting that will show the duality of this dark, industrialized world, ironically lit with ubiquitous billboards advertising the latest and greatest products. Zones such as high-class districts, being gilded cages for their residents; dirty, overcrowded slums, teeming with illegal implants trade; corporate megastructures, hiding many dark secrets, for which the competition would pay a hefty price.</p>
<p>There’s no place for procedural world generation, no constant deja vu while visiting new locations. Every area in Coma will be handcrafted and unique while maintaining the artistic cohesion and our vision of the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Animation</h2>
<p>To bring Coma’s characters to life we are using Spine. It allows us to achieve great animation fidelity thanks to its advanced skeletal animation and mesh deformation systems. Combined, these two techniques let us show off every small detail, such as movement of character’s outfit, gear, hair or facial expressions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://light-echo.pl/images/indiegogo/aaa2.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Thanks to the synergy between Spine and Unity, we have control of every aspect of the animations, so they can be transitioned smoothly from one to another without the erratic appearance, but where it’s necessary they can be quick and snappy to eliminate the feeling of unresponsive controls.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://light-echo.pl/images/indiegogo/2017-05-23-03-29-47-5.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Using Spine’s Inverse Kinematics and Weights systems we can create complex behaviours with relatively low effort and in a timely manner. For example we can assure the character is pointing the weapon directly at an enemy, regardless of the position - whether the character is standing, jumping or kneeling. No need for hundreds of redundant animations.</p>
<p>That said, we need to hire animators, who can take the advantage of all those neat features, and who can create detailed, yet dynamic movements, for every playable character, enemy and boss.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492584374/zlkitjvfihkgwmuyicif.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>By supporting Coma, we assure you that 100% of the funds will be used for financing the project. With your help we'll be able to hire more talent and buy or license any software needed to deliver a complete and polished game.</p>
<p>We realize we are asking for a hefty amount of money, especially in view of us not having much experience. However the final amount has been carefully calculated, and represents the overall budget we need to finish the core game. Without your support we will not be able to bring Coma to life.</p>
<p>It goes without saying the more money we raise, the better the game is going to be. Beyond adding features listed as stretch goals, we will have the luxury of adding some extra touches and making sure the experience you get from playing our game are nothing but positive.</p>
<p>We should also mention, that this campaign is the only form of financing Coma. We don't have any deals with publishers, it also isn't designed to measure interest.</p>
<p>In order to help you understand how the money will be split among various portions of the project, here's a handy-dandy pie chart:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494532631/wc5iz7puutlwwrmukkpa.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>As you can see a lion's share of the money will go to pay for things that don't directly contribute to developing the game itself. Nevertheless, as a legally operating company, we can't avoid those costs. We hope you see that the final amount we ask for the project is fully justified.</p>
<p>Thanks to you we'll be able to provide a fair pay to the hired programmers and artists, no matter what part of the world they come from, as well as existing members of our team. In turn we promise to deliver a compelling game in terms of its story and gameplay.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why crowdfunding?</h2>
<p>We have been working on Coma full-time for over a year. We’ve invested many hours and private funds, which are unfortunately running low.</p>
<p>As fans of cyberpunk and metroidvania-style games we would love to contribute to both by marrying both of those genres of fiction and games. However such small budget and team we currently have are not enough to fully realize our vision.</p>
<p>Thanks to your support we will be able to expand our team by hiring the right people for the right job, especially programmers, environmental artists and animators who will help flesh out and populate the world of Coma. We will also be able to give the game the soundtrack it deserves, filled with music that properly conveys the uncertain atmosphere or packs a punch for the boss battles.</p>
<p>There are many ideas we would like to realize in Coma, and without your help it won’t be possible. With every new stretch goal achieved, we’ll add additional elements, which will help in portraying a lived-in and rich, complex world, and make the experience of playing the game more fun and memorable.</p>
<p>We simply ask you to play the prototype, and if you find it enjoyable, please consider pledging to the campaign. If you thought it wasn't your cup of tea, or you think a prototype stage is too early to decide, THAT'S TOTALLY COOL WITH US! :)</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>A Brief History</strong></h2>
<p>Light Echo is a team of enthusiastic video game geeks from Poland, who spent their lives playing a vast selection of games from multiple genres. At some point in our lives, after graduating college (you can trust us, we're engineers ;) ), we realized that games are a big part of who we are, and a vision of working in the game industry was born. In 2012 we realized that vision by starting a company dedicated to making games.</p>
<p>At the beginning of our endeavor we decided to start small and target the mobile market. We quickly realized that without prior experience in game development it won't be an easy task. We had to learn everything, from choosing the right people for the right job, managing the team and the workflow, through choosing the best tools, to all the boring, but equally important, legal and accountancy stuff.</p>
<p>The first fruit of our labor was Final Dusk - a simple action-puzzle game, designed to be played in multiple short sittings, with colorful graphics and funny, easy-to-follow plot. Soon after the release it became apparent, that without an enormous stroke of luck or a huge marketing budget, a new game appearing on mobile market is destined to get covered with countless new apps (and clones of clones) flooding the app stores daily.</p>
<p>Seeking new sources of revenue, we decided to publish Final Dusk on a PC. After converting the game to best suit the PC platform, we gave Steam Greenlight a shot. In 2014 Final Dusk was approved to enter the retail space of Steam.</p>
<p>The experience and knowledge we gained from creating, and trying sell our first game was invaluable. We fully understand the pitfalls of game development and self-publishing. If we were to repeat that process today, we'd do a bunch of things differently from the get go. But we want to grow and expand, work on a more ambitious project, that's designed for more mature platforms and for more mature audiences. We hope Coma will be that project, and for that we need your help.</p>

</div></div>","You can download a playable prototype of Coma here:Please keep in mind this is not a demo, but a very early prototype, showing just a small part of elements and mechanics that we hope to implement in the final game. The animations, sounds, effects, environmental art, etc. are not representative of the final product. Please, treat this prototype as an outline or a rough sketch of the game we hope to deliver.Note: we strongly recommend using an XBox controller or any other XInput compatible one. When using Sony's DualShock 4 with DS4Windows, you may need to enable option ""Hide DS4 Controller"" in the Settings tab to avoid unwanted behavior. When using any other Direct Input controller, we recommend using x360ce to emulate an XBox contoller.  Year 2076. The world is being rebuilt after a war and from its rubble rises a new order - UTG - United Terran Government, unifying the whole globe and setting a new, common goal for the mankind. Thanks to the advancements in robotics, nanotechnology and bioengineering, the society reached a higher level of existence - over 94% of citizens of the Earth use enhanced prosthetics or is permanently connected to the global network thanks to telecommunication implants. The implants are a product of Providers - constantly competing with each other megacorporations that supply, install and update various implants in exchange for life-long subscription. In a world without borders they decide what's good or evil, and the one which is above competition is always right. Welcome to the future, where the worth of a human life is equivalent to an average monthly salary and where corporate espionage is the new form of warfare. Have you picked your Provider yet?  We would like to start off by saying a few words about Coma's stage in its life cycle.The project is still in very early stages of development. The goal of this campaign is to kick-start the real development of any missing core systems, build upon those that already are in place and to hire artists and coders that will help us realize this project in a timely manner. It is not to show off nearly finished product, as a marketing tool or to gauge interest for potential investors.There are a number of features and systems having necessary scripting implemented, but they are not accessible by the player in the current build. Some systems are not yet decided upon, and have multiple versions that we consider leaving as a final one (for example: we currently have 3 versions of targeting - traditional 8-way targeting tied to movement, a lock-on system that is independent of character's movement and direction, and a completely free, 360-degree gun rotation, à la twin stick shooter games). Some of the features are done, but are using placeholders - like most of current animations - while some are completely missing. There are no real enemies in the game yet. Designing them with their moveset, animating and scripting their AI will take a substantial amount of time.With that said, we hope after you read the campaign page you will see the potential of Coma. We encourage you to download the prototype and judge for yourself if it's worth investing in a project that's this early in its life.  If the funding goal of the campaign is reached, the game will consist of 7 distinct locations or areas, each having 2 new enemy types. That excludes any variations of the enemies encountered in previous locations, since the bulk of the work, such as artwork, animation, behavioral scripting will have been already done.Due to the complexity of the bosses themselves, and due to the fact the fights are going to be designed with a multi-angle approach in mind, the cost of each individual boss encounter is proportionally higher. We know that boss fights are high points for players to test the skills and strategies they mastered, as well as the gear they acquired. However we feel we need to limit the amount of these encounters in order to keep the base cost to a minimum and add them as the stretch goals are unlocked.  Below you can find a description of each stretch goal:

$200,000 - Additional Character - We'll add  Hikaru Yukimura as a second playable character. Each character will have their own unique set of animations and interactions with the NPCs. You can read more about each character below.

$280,000 - Co-op (local and online) - We'll add an ability to play with a friend in a cooperative mode, whether locally - sharing a single screen or via the series of tubes, known as the Internet. You can read more about the Co-op below.

$310,000 - 2 Additional Bosses - We'll add 2 bosses to existing areas. Each boss will be designed with multiple ways to beat them. You can read more about boss fights below.

$350,000 - New Area With a Boss - We'll add a completely new area with its own distinct visual design, new enemies and a power you can acquire, culminating with a boss fight.

$370,000 - Additional Character - We'll add  Kurt Watson as a third playable character. Each character will have their own unique set of animations and interactions with the NPCs. You can read more about each character below.

$400,000 - 2 Additional Bosses - We'll add 2 bosses to existing areas. Each boss will be designed with multiple ways to beat them. You can read more about boss fights below.

$440,000 - New Area With a Boss - We'll add a second unique new area, populated with new NPCs, enemies and a boss.

$580,000 - Animated Cinematic - We'll hire a studio to create an opening cinematic introducing players to the dystopian world of Coma, done in anime style.

$??? - More areas, enemy types, bosses, mini-bosses and overall awesomeness
  OverviewComa is a Metroidvania-style action game set in a grim cyberpunk future inspired by the classics of the genre. Play as a member of an elite squad on a payroll of one of the Megacorporations, explore industrialized districts to find hidden, optional areas; fight with competition's mercenaries using your arsenal of weapons and unique abilities. Customize your character using multitude of passive and active implants, acquire new combat abilities and upgrade those already owned. Main Features
Discover a dark cyberpunk world, inspired by the biggest classics of the genre, presented with beautiful hand-drawn sprites and backgrounds.
Multiple playstyles. Do you like fighting defensively or offensively? Do you prefer hand-to-hand combat or destroying opponents from afar is your cup of tea? Or perhaps instead of fighting it’s better to take control of enemy systems and machines to do your dirty work for you? Agents of corporate special forces are prepared to fight in all conditions with any means.
Customize your character - utilize a wide range of specialized passive and active implants to tailor the playstyle to your needs. Enhanced strength, speed, special vision filters - bleeding edge tech is at your disposal and on the house. Utilizing every advantage over your competition is mandatory in your line of work. Just remember not to overindulge in your artificial self-improvement. There’s a fine line between a human and a machine, if that’s your concern.
Variety of Abilities - acquire new abilities that will help you reach previously inaccessible areas to discover secrets and most importantly - grant you new combat moves. Remember, some of the abilities will be hidden, and getting them will be optional. It is only up to you how many of them will be in your arsenal.
Co-op - each agent is an expert in their field of work, wreaking havoc among the competition. Imagine the synergy between them and level of destruction if there were two of them sent on a single mission. (Stretch goal)
 Story  Exorno Tech is one of the largest and most influential Providers. Known as a supplier of high-end cerebral implants and a leader in cybernetics development, the corporation is hiding a secret. The majority of its budget isn’t assigned to R&D of new technologies, but instead to a vast network of spies and mercenaries, thanks to which Exorno is able to obtain research and prototypes from their competition and be first to bring them to market.An hour ago, a man identifying himself as dr François Adrien Molière contacted one of Exorno’s executives. A scientist formerly working for the Abrams corp. claims he has information about new tech developed in absolute secrecy and he’s willing to negotiate the price of that information.Chairman Gerhard Keller along with the board of directors decided to look into the matter. The chief of Exorno’s “Security Division”, gen. Stanley Vincent received an order to mobilize the special response unit. The objective is simple - contact dr Molière, verify the authenticity of the information and escort him to the extraction zone. On the surface it’s a routine operation, however the general can’t shake the feeling it will be much more complicated than it seems... The World  In 2076 corporations rule the world. The most powerful among them are Providers - manufacturers and suppliers of prosthetic and telecommunication implants. Thanks to their influence in the still young UTG (United Terran Government), they forced a number of policies that effectively coerce average citizens to use their products. Personal data, credit and medical history and most importantly Global Information Network access - all available through the use of a single implant. The installation surgeries are expensive, additionally the implants need to be regularly replaced or upgraded to newer standards, and there are special drugs that need to be taken to avoid rejection. Not to mention a multitude of hidden additional maintenance and operational fees. Because of this the Providers ensure comprehensive implant servicing in exchange for lifetime subscription, effectively enslaving their customers.In this world the fight for the customer is effectively fight for power and any competition is a sworn enemy. To remain on top you need to get your hands dirty. Espionage, kidnappings, blackmail, staged accidents - anything goes in the corporate war for the biggest influence, there is no place for half measures. All of this is in the job description of corporate mercenaries - top tier dirty work experts.The game world will be divided into zones, each distinct in its look and atmosphere, all accessible from a hub zone. In the hub zone the player will be able to gather intel about an upcoming task, replenish resources, or pick up some non-essential sidequests. Fulfilling those will grant special implants, access to previously closed areas or the most valuable of all - information, that may lead to some sweet loot.As the player progresses in the story and interacts with the world, the zones will change over time to reflect the progress, with new paths opened or old ones no longer accessible, so revisiting previously seen areas won't be a simple backtracking.We plan to populate the world with rich and complex characters, fueled by their own goals and desires. Alongside main characters that are the central point of the story, there will be a handful of supporting cast - characters who help the player, like supervisors that give orders, comms operators monitoring your progress, offering a helpful advice, etc. QuestsAs we mentioned above, the player will be able to meet some quest givers in the hub zone. Those quests will range from fairly standard in the world of Coma corporate espionage to assassinations.Fulfilling quests may reward you with some loot - access to otherwise not obtainable implants or upgrades, etc., some quests will have a minor impact on the upcoming missions - you may get a password to a terminal that unlocks a helpful shortcut or disables some of the security. On the other hand, progressing in the story may render current quests not finishable (for example, one of the sidequests may require gathering some data off a mainframe in a certain location but you destroyed the mainframe or the power source, and now you can't complete the quest). That said, Coma is not designed as a full-blown action RPG, with multiple branching paths in the main story and sidequests. Quests will be totally optional and non-essential part of the game, that give you more insight into some events or characters, and a tool for deeper world building. Narration  Story told in Coma is a vision of the future encompassing technological, political and economic aspects of society and the world in general. For this reason it’s important for us to present it in such a way not to overwhelm the player.The plot is presented in a form of a dialogue between multiple characters. Because every playable character is different, the dialogue will vary depending on their personality and relations with NPCs.Additional information, that will flesh out the world or help the player understand the events occurring in the world around can be obtained by finding scattered datapads or hacking various terminals. Some of them may contain valuable hints or codes to locked paths or containers.Finally, the environment will tell a story of its own. Fresh blood trails, a body lying nearby, a lost toy, an opened vent - every little detail can be a part of a tragic history that occurred in the past or a hint leading to unexpected encounters. ExplorationWhile playing you will visit detailed areas, meticulously designed to deliver just the right amount of challenge from the non-linear exploration. Each area can be revisited at any point of the game, allowing you to discover numerous secrets and shortcuts, which can be reached as you gain new abilities and upgrades.Said abilities can be used both in combat and for level traversal. For example you can use the vertical dash to reach ledges high above the reach of your jump, or use the slide dash to slide under a narrow passage. Co-OpWe would like for the players to have an option to experience the whole game in a 2-player co-op mode, locally and online. It’s always fun to share gaming experiences with a buddy. However there is a myriad of elements that would require completely different approach and design. From ensuring the right balance of power between characters (and enemies), making sure the enemies pose a right amount of challenge for two players without having just increased health pools, technical things e.g. implementing a suitable split screen technique, to developing a robust netcode and utilizing many, not unified, platform-specific APIs to provide players with quick and seamless ways of getting into the game with their friends.As you might imagine, it’s one of the more costly aspect of game development, that’s why we decided to make the co-op mode as one of the stretch goals.   We plan for each character to be unique by equipping them with different weapons and abilities. By doing so, we hope to ensure every player can chose a character that fits their playstyle or make each consecutive playthrough a fresh experience.However, each character will require a separate set of animations and different set of dialogues that reflect the relations between them and the NPCs. That’s why some of them will be added as a stretch goal is achieved, after reaching the funding goal. 
Kamila Wilk

Former member of special operations force, medium range weapons and CQC expert. Kamila is cunning and cynical, but also loyal and reliable. She struggles with accepting the new world order so working on the brink or beyond the law isn't a problem for her. The only thing she desires from the job is the thrill of the fight, and thankfully for her it's plentiful in her line of work with the corporation. She is equipped with a number of military grade implants, however she is mostly human.
 
Hikaru Yukimura

Former member of an intelligence agency, infiltration and assassination expert. During one of her missions a rogue agent ratted her out, causing her to be captured and tortured. After her release, she had to undergo multiple surgeries, which replaced over 90% of her body with cybernetic components. Attempts on hacking her brain for sensitive information permanently damaged a region of her brain responsible for emotions and empathy, making her an impassive half-machine, indifferently executing any order of her new corporate bosses.
 
Kurt Watson

Former Chicago SWAT member. Short range weapons expert, also skilled in hand-to-hand combat. Cold and ruthless, fired for excessive brutality while fighting the street gangs. He will fulfill his task no matter the cost. Both his arms have been replaced with cybernetic prosthetics which give him superhuman strength.
 
Character Customization

 
Upgrades
During exploration you will come across various upgrades. Upgrades are pieces of equipment granting the characters new abilities (or expanding those already obtained) used for level traversing and in combat. Some of the upgrades are character-specific, some of them are optional and acquiring them will help you find secret pathways and areas or help you with disposing of your opponents.
Upgrade examples:

EMP - Disrupt or disable enemies’ optical cammo, find hidden paths obscured by holographic projections.
Combat Hacking Module - take control over enemy drones and defense systems and turn them against your opponents.
Vision Enhancement - enemies using optical camouflage or hidden in the dark won’t surprise you anymore.

 
Implants
One of main advantages of being a cyborg is the ability of installing various implants.
Implants are completely optional character enhancements that can add or modify already owned abilities, allowing to create many, sometimes vastly different variants of the same character, tailored to your playstyle.
Do you find yourself taking too much damage because you like to go all in? Consider installing a medical implant which will slowly regenerate your life. Do you have a problem with hitting certain enemy? Smart lock-on will take care of it for you. Experiment with different implant combinations to make the character truly unique.
 

 
The combat is one of critical elements in Coma. We want to design a combat system that’s highly dynamic, where every skirmish feels fast and snappy, the character obeys every input, while maintaining the illusion of weight and impact to the most devastating attacks.
 
Mobility
We want to put a heavy emphasis on mobility and versatility in combat. The player will be able to react to enemy attacks using various methods of basic and advanced controls. Apart from the fundamental movement, such as running, jumping, crouching, the player will have access to advanced movement techniques such as dashing, dodging or blocking. They can be used in combination with the directional controls, vastly modifying the performed move. Those advanced techniques will be granted by upgrades found during the exploration, and can be further enhanced to add various effects.
 

 
Firearms

The primary means of combat in Coma are firearms. However, we want to make sure the combat is not boring and tedious. To achieve that, different enemies will be vulnerable to different types of ammunition.

Some enemies will have multiple defensive ‘layers’, such as heavy armor or energy barriers, which you will have to peel away. While fighting heavy-armored foes you will have to use armor-piercing ammo to strip them of their armor first, and then finish them off with the standard projectiles.

Furthermore, we want to encourage the player to use close-quarters-combat. While fighting against enemies utilizing multiple defences described above, after destroying one of the layers, the enemy will enter a dazed state, which you can utilize to your advantage by performing a melee move that will permanently disable each type of defense. Otherwise there is a chance the enemy will recover that particular defensive measure.
 

 
Further incentive will be in form of recovering a part of lost health or energy after performing those powerful attacks.
We plan for each character to have a weapon unique to them, ensuring you can pick your favorite fighting style based on fire rate, range, knockback, etc.
 
Abilities
Ranged and melee combat are fun, but being a cyborg brings much more to the table. Thanks to various combat implants you will be able to do much more. Hack an enemy exoskeleton to wreak havoc, use thermo-optical camouflage, hack enemy cyber implants to confuse them or hinder their abilities. Use everything in your disposal to defeat forces of your competition.
 
Energy
One of main resources you will need to manage, besides your health, will be energy.
Each additional passive implant will decrease the amount of available energy. Whereas every active implant will use up the energy at a constant rate when activated.
Additionally, your abilities will also use up your energy, so maintaining a balance between a number of installed and activated implants will be crucial to your success.
There will also be different ways to regain your lost energy. It will automatically recover over time, performing a melee finishing move on your opponents will replenish a substantial portion of it.
 
Enemies
There are many opponents that will stand in your way. Automated defense systems, cybernetically enhanced mercenaries or heavily armored combat vehicles. Your competition doesn’t like unwanted guests and will try to dispose of you by any means necessary.

Remember, your enemies are also equipped with the latest military-grade tech and will utilize every advantage against you. Their arsenal consists of:

optical/thermal camouflage
combat exosuits
hacking implants
frag, stun, EMP grenades

and many more, requiring a different approach to every skirmish.
 
Bosses
While exploring the world of Coma you will face powerful boss enemies. They will range from AI-operated systems, through fierce mercenary commanders, to military vehicles, such as battle tanks.
Each Boss fight will be meticulously designed to offer the right amount of challenge and put your skills to the test. Some of the bosses will have multiple stages, where they will use more and more deadly attacks or become faster, shortening your reaction window.
 

 
You will be able to defeat them in couple of ways, such as:

direct combat - well timed evasive maneuvers and quick thinking will allow you to face the boss face to face
utilizing environmental elements - lure the boss to a hazardous zone dealing massive damage, destroy sources of light making yourself harder to hit, hack and take control of defense systems forcing the boss to split their focus, and more
exploit their weaknesses - e.g. destroy targeting systems on an enemy machine to make their attacks less effective

Hacking
What would a world set in a cyberpunk reality be without some good 'ol hacking?
Cyber warfare, while being one of the crucial parts of Coma's combat and exploration, it will be totally optional.
Combat Hacking
Characters equipped with a combat hacking implant will be able to take control over enemy drones, defense systems and disrupt other cybernetically enhanced adversaries, or even make them fight on their side for a short period of time.
Higher tiers of the hacking implant will allow the player to hack multiple enemies at the same time, or even perform a powerful burst hack, that will affect everything in a radius around the character.
While fighting bosses, it may be beneficial to disrupt their targeting systems, disable the most devastating weapons or hack part of the level itself to open a new path in order to exploit their weak points more effectively.
Hacking While Exploring
Hacking will be a great source to obtain new intel about forces you're fighting with, get access to previously closed paths, or get some top-secret information. That information may be valuable both to your employers or to some 3rd party that's also interested in your work.
In contrast to combat hacking that lets the player instantly take over enemy systems in exchange for energy, we want the ""exploration hacking"" to be more involved. However, we would like to avoid making a simple minigame that leaves you with just the taste. We would like to create a cyberspace where the character gets ""transported"" and is represented by their avatar, where they have to face various obstacles and challenges. Failing those challenges or getting detected will trigger defensive countermeasures. In this cyberspace the character will still be controlled like normal, but will have a different skillset and equipment. You can think of it as something similar to Shadowrun's cyber combat, where a character is represented by a powerful avatar, facing manifestations of different firewalls, defensive subroutines and tracking programs.
 

 
Engine
In its core, Coma uses Unity engine. We chose it for this project due to several reasons. First and foremost, our team had previous experience in working with it, which is a great advantage, since we know the engine’s strengths and shortcomings.

Unity offers great support for 2D and 3D objects out of the box, allowing us to mix and match various elements on the scene to achieve the look we want.
Due to its versatility, Unity can be easily expanded or modified to support new features, building on its core.
 
Environments
We want all the areas in Coma to be represented by beautiful, hand-crafted artwork along with real-time, atmospheric in-engine lighting that will show the duality of this dark, industrialized world, ironically lit with ubiquitous billboards advertising the latest and greatest products. Zones such as high-class districts, being gilded cages for their residents; dirty, overcrowded slums, teeming with illegal implants trade; corporate megastructures, hiding many dark secrets, for which the competition would pay a hefty price.
There’s no place for procedural world generation, no constant deja vu while visiting new locations. Every area in Coma will be handcrafted and unique while maintaining the artistic cohesion and our vision of the future.
 
Animation
To bring Coma’s characters to life we are using Spine. It allows us to achieve great animation fidelity thanks to its advanced skeletal animation and mesh deformation systems. Combined, these two techniques let us show off every small detail, such as movement of character’s outfit, gear, hair or facial expressions.

Thanks to the synergy between Spine and Unity, we have control of every aspect of the animations, so they can be transitioned smoothly from one to another without the erratic appearance, but where it’s necessary they can be quick and snappy to eliminate the feeling of unresponsive controls.

Using Spine’s Inverse Kinematics and Weights systems we can create complex behaviours with relatively low effort and in a timely manner. For example we can assure the character is pointing the weapon directly at an enemy, regardless of the position - whether the character is standing, jumping or kneeling. No need for hundreds of redundant animations.
That said, we need to hire animators, who can take the advantage of all those neat features, and who can create detailed, yet dynamic movements, for every playable character, enemy and boss.
 

 
By supporting Coma, we assure you that 100% of the funds will be used for financing the project. With your help we'll be able to hire more talent and buy or license any software needed to deliver a complete and polished game.
We realize we are asking for a hefty amount of money, especially in view of us not having much experience. However the final amount has been carefully calculated, and represents the overall budget we need to finish the core game. Without your support we will not be able to bring Coma to life.
It goes without saying the more money we raise, the better the game is going to be. Beyond adding features listed as stretch goals, we will have the luxury of adding some extra touches and making sure the experience you get from playing our game are nothing but positive.
We should also mention, that this campaign is the only form of financing Coma. We don't have any deals with publishers, it also isn't designed to measure interest.
In order to help you understand how the money will be split among various portions of the project, here's a handy-dandy pie chart:
 

 
As you can see a lion's share of the money will go to pay for things that don't directly contribute to developing the game itself. Nevertheless, as a legally operating company, we can't avoid those costs. We hope you see that the final amount we ask for the project is fully justified.
Thanks to you we'll be able to provide a fair pay to the hired programmers and artists, no matter what part of the world they come from, as well as existing members of our team. In turn we promise to deliver a compelling game in terms of its story and gameplay.
 
Why crowdfunding?
We have been working on Coma full-time for over a year. We’ve invested many hours and private funds, which are unfortunately running low.
As fans of cyberpunk and metroidvania-style games we would love to contribute to both by marrying both of those genres of fiction and games. However such small budget and team we currently have are not enough to fully realize our vision.
Thanks to your support we will be able to expand our team by hiring the right people for the right job, especially programmers, environmental artists and animators who will help flesh out and populate the world of Coma. We will also be able to give the game the soundtrack it deserves, filled with music that properly conveys the uncertain atmosphere or packs a punch for the boss battles.
There are many ideas we would like to realize in Coma, and without your help it won’t be possible. With every new stretch goal achieved, we’ll add additional elements, which will help in portraying a lived-in and rich, complex world, and make the experience of playing the game more fun and memorable.
We simply ask you to play the prototype, and if you find it enjoyable, please consider pledging to the campaign. If you thought it wasn't your cup of tea, or you think a prototype stage is too early to decide, THAT'S TOTALLY COOL WITH US! :)
 

 
A Brief History
Light Echo is a team of enthusiastic video game geeks from Poland, who spent their lives playing a vast selection of games from multiple genres. At some point in our lives, after graduating college (you can trust us, we're engineers ;) ), we realized that games are a big part of who we are, and a vision of working in the game industry was born. In 2012 we realized that vision by starting a company dedicated to making games.
At the beginning of our endeavor we decided to start small and target the mobile market. We quickly realized that without prior experience in game development it won't be an easy task. We had to learn everything, from choosing the right people for the right job, managing the team and the workflow, through choosing the best tools, to all the boring, but equally important, legal and accountancy stuff.
The first fruit of our labor was Final Dusk - a simple action-puzzle game, designed to be played in multiple short sittings, with colorful graphics and funny, easy-to-follow plot. Soon after the release it became apparent, that without an enormous stroke of luck or a huge marketing budget, a new game appearing on mobile market is destined to get covered with countless new apps (and clones of clones) flooding the app stores daily.
Seeking new sources of revenue, we decided to publish Final Dusk on a PC. After converting the game to best suit the PC platform, we gave Steam Greenlight a shot. In 2014 Final Dusk was approved to enter the retail space of Steam.
The experience and knowledge we gained from creating, and trying sell our first game was invaluable. We fully understand the pitfalls of game development and self-publishing. If we were to repeat that process today, we'd do a bunch of things differently from the get go. But we want to grow and expand, work on a more ambitious project, that's designed for more mature platforms and for more mature audiences. We hope Coma will be that project, and for that we need your help.

You will be questing, taking risks to fight vicious creatures throughout many landscapes, while battling to keep the bonds with the woman of your life. Depending on which woman you go for, the main story of Enamor changes, giving the player a chance to venture forth and explore the other story arcs. With beautiful backgrounds, alluring artwork, captivating characters and epic stories to be told, Enamor is sure to be a new experience to dating simulators.The game takes place way, way, distant into the future, but not in a world built by science and technology. The Earth we all now know has been wiped out by nuclear wars, making it unfavorable for comfortable living. Because of that, the kind inhabitants of this Old Earth had to adapt to be able to survive. And, throughout the generations, several of these inhabitants have evolved into various races: Humans, Elves, Dragoons, Faeries, Dwarves, while others became monsters who have lost all of the remaining kindness in them. The Old Earth's atmosphere was brimming with so much radiation that many of the flora and fauna have mutated breathing life to new kinds of species. Slowly, the Old Earth was able to stabilize and return to its natural state, though remains of the past still linger.This new earth, was then called The World of Peroseas. Despite this, the Peroseans never dared to live the modern lives their ancestors lived in. They stayed living the life similar to that of the medieval ages - as if they learned not to repeat the history and wrath their ancestors have caused upon the Old Earth. The Peroseans also feared the legions of monsters that try to shake off the peace from The World of Peroseas. Most kingdoms such as the Kingdom of Valhalli have prestigious and elite soldiers who would repel the monsters' attacks, some of which were once their own kin, just to preserve the peace they fought for so long to attain.You play the role of Gavrail, a man who doesn't have much to brag. As a boy, he was left with nothing as his village was viciously attacked and burned down by monsters. However, he was rescued by the Knights of Valhalli and was given safe haven in the Kingdom. Because of this supreme act of heroism, the young Gavrail dreamed to protect the kingdom once he grows older, seeing the entire kingdom as a family and not a mere city. Years passed by and he rose into the ranks. He embedded in his heart that his dream is all he had to live for, until he sets his eyes onto the woman whom his heart longed to be with. A young and simple elf lady, Sylvie works hard to maintain a fairly lesser known inn. She always wishes to take care of those around her and is willing to lend a helping hand to the injured and hungry. Despite having a lesser known inn, she still tries her best to satisfy her customers. However, seeing soldiers in her inn gives her an uneasy feeling that triggers a horrific flashback, which relates to a grim experience she tries so hard to forget.​ Mysterious, eerie, and quiet are the three words that best describe this stoic human alchemist who hailed from a distant kingdom.

The sole purpose of their existence is to risk their lives to get these gems for The Boss (their ruler). But what happens when you get them all?</p>
<p>Bleak has hand created caverns chosen at random for you to dwell into with each life. Keepers hold the Power Gems and must be destroyed to move onto the next cavern. Some creatures feed off old gems and explode with fragments upon their death. You can collect these fragments and buy upgrades, health, or even an invincible bubble from the shopkeep. Upgrades and bundles of gem fragments can be found in chests left behind from the others before you. Use these to your advantage and get the Power Gems to The Boss!</p>

</h3><p><i>It started only as rumors.. Priests made their
augurys and all the signs were there. Druids talked to the animals, big and
small, and consulted the spirits of the nature and land. Finally the most
powerful wizards of the land gathered and summoned all their powers to crack
open the curtain of time and saw what the future held. And it was all true. It
is coming.. MECGE, Most Epic Card Game Ever and they all had to get a copy and
start the Fight for Egion!</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What is MECGE?</h3><p> </p><h3></h3><p>MECGE is a
new card game which combines the best parts of a traditional tabletop RPG and a
trading card game. You can earn experience and gain levels just as in
traditional RPG with the simplicity of a card game. And the best part is that
you don`t even need a Dungeon Master to plan and host the gaming sessions. All the
events and encounters can be drawn randomly with the cards. So just have few
friends over, get the cards and start playing. All the skills and items gained
in the previous games are still yours and you can start playing from where you
left off. Basic rules are so simple that anyone with some gaming experience
learns them very fast. However, different cards bring new features and variety
to the gameplay, so that every gaming session will be different and unique
experience.</p><p> </p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What does it include?</h3><p> </p><h3></h3><p>The game will consist of four decks of cards; creatures, treasure, spells and random. The overall number of cards will be around 200. The exact number depends on the selected printing facility and how many cards will be in one set. There will also be a game board, rulebook and some simple counters to keep track of the hit points and the mana points.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How is it played?</h3><p> </p><p>Anyone who has played RPG knows that it takes quite a lot of planning from the person who is running the game aka Dungeon Master. In MECGE the cards act as a DM in a way that encounters and treasures are drawn randomly from the decks. Players have their characters recorded in a character sheet and fighting the creatures takes place on a game board which is a simple battlemap. So basically the fighting is done just like in traditional RPG`s. You can even use your own miniatures if you have some with a suitable base size for the board. Other players throw the dice for the monsters, so in that way it is more brutal than traditional RPG where DM can give you some slack throwing dice behind the screen. And when you defeat monsters you get to draw treasure cards and gain items which will make you character stronger. You get also experience points and when you get enough of them, your character will rise in levels just as in any other RPG. There are also wizard and priest spells which can be cast to aid in combat.</p><p><br/> </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/435560/files/20140315102930-Montage.png?1394904570"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><br/>Random deck has three kinds of cards; locations, special and skills. Special cards are random events which affect the player and gameplay, some good and some bad. Players can also get skills to make their character better. Locations are a very important part of the game. They are placed on the map of the game world and there are some rules in which order they can be owned. Also it`s not possible to own locations which are not connected by some way, either being adjacent in the map or connected by a portal for example. Locations also give you income, gold and mana points. Most cards have also a somekind discard value, so you can also sacrifice some card to get a temporary boost in battle.</p><p> </p><p>By owning locations players can climb the social ladder in the kingdom of Egion. Every player starts as a peasant, but when he/she owns enough locations and becomes a noble he/she can challenge the King. Becoming the King is the ultimate goal toward which the players strive for. Players have to help eachother to fight the creatures and become stronger, but at the same time they have to watch out that the other players don`t become too strong and maybe throw some curve balls their way. After all, there can be only one King!  </p><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/439547/files/20140317090705-Montage2V2.png?1395072425"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The game setting is traditional fantasy. Typical character classes fighters, wizards etc. and spells and items are all there. It is hard to be very original and MECGE does not even try to be. Quite the opposite, the game is meant to have that traditional ""feeling"" and anyone who has played these kinds of games should learn it pretty easily. So basically it is suitable as an entry level game for people just getting to know RPG and it is also very good for not-so-serious gaming sessions where you can spend the evening with friends and maybe have few beverages while playing. <b>  </b><br/></p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The pictures look nice. Who is the artist?</h3><br/>So far there are pictures from over 60 different artists and there will still be even more. They range from hobbyists to professional artists. Some of them are already renowned and some are still making a name for themselves. They are all very talented and many of them have already worked in the gaming industry. Featured pictures show now their user names in deviantart (<a href=""http://www.deviantart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.deviantart.com</a>), but depending on individual wishes their real names may be on the printed cards. <br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/442605/files/20140318111644-Montage3.png?1395166604"" src="""" style=""width: 512.85px; height: 368px;""/></p><i>Some cards are in landscape orintation to better show off the beautiful artwork.</i><br/><br/><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What is the campaign goal?</h3><p><br/>The goal of the campaign is to get the funding needed to 
arrange the printing of the game. If the goal is reached it will still take few months to finalize the game. The printing of
 the game would be done after that. Estimated time of delivery is Q4/2014.</p><p>This is Fixed Funding, meaning that if the goal is not reached the contributions are refunded. Most printing companies have a minumum print run, so the goal has to be reached in order to make that minimum quantity for printing the game.</p><p><br/> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Are there any plans for future development?</h3><br/><p>If the funding is successfull a new company will be started to continue the development at a more professional level.</p><p></p><p>Do you
think that some of the main stream game companies flood the games with new
sourcebooks and expansions all the time and you just can`t afford to keep up
even if you wanted to. The plan with MECGE is not do that. It is just not possible for a small
game company. And also we believe that the game will have to stay interesting
with just the basic sets and rules without having to push out new stuff all the
time. This does not mean that the game will not be developed at all. We do plan
to make new cards and expansions but at a pace which will not cause you to
spend all your money. And we plan also to listen to the players and learn in
which direction they would like to game to be developed. In our vision every
new addition to the game should be something to look forward to and spend the
night in queue like the new ""Lord of the Rings"" -movies or iPhones.</p><p>
</p><p>Are the
cards collectible some might ask, yes and no. Being the first edition and a
very small print run there isn`t a possibility to customize the decks, so every
copy of the game has got the same cards. That customization comes with
increased cost and it is only reasonable with long printing runs and we try to make
the game as affordable as possible. In the same time being a very small print
all the cards will be collectable if the game becomes successful. Think if you
would own cards from the very first printing of some very successful card game.
And if there would be longer printing runs later then there would also be cards
which are not as common as others.</p><p> </p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How can I help?</h3><p> </p><p></p><p>Just simply by backing the campaign. If you can`t afford to do it, another way of helping is to spread the word and the funding link: in Facebook, Twitter, gaming and fantasy forums and everywhere else.</p><p>Also, if you are interested in the game, please back the campaign rather sooner than later. In crowdfunding people only tend to back campaigns which look like are going to succeed. So in the early stages of the campaign it is hard to get those first backers and people not backing the campaign just because there aren`t many backers before them is a kind of a self fulfilling prophecy.<br/></p><p> </p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Will be there any new perks and strech goals?</h3><p><br/></p><p>Yes, definately! This is just to start the campaign and it will go on for 60 days. The possible perks are having your own RPG character being made immortal by making it a card or getting signed prints of the pictures or something like that.. <br/></p><p>Possible stretch goals are making some new booster packs or game modules and introducing new kingdoms and lands with some new creatures and items.</p><p>It will be possible to change the selected perk later, so please do not wait until the last minute waiting for some new and better perks and strecth goals..<br/></p><br/></div>","It started only as rumors..

There will also be a game board, rulebook and some simple counters to keep track of the hit points and the mana points. How is it played? Anyone who has played RPG knows that it takes quite a lot of planning from the person who is running the game aka Dungeon Master. In MECGE the cards act as a DM in a way that encounters and treasures are drawn randomly from the decks. Players have their characters recorded in a character sheet and fighting the creatures takes place on a game board which is a simple battlemap. So basically the fighting is done just like in traditional RPG`s. You can even use your own miniatures if you have some with a suitable base size for the board. Other players throw the dice for the monsters, so in that way it is more brutal than traditional RPG where DM can give you some slack throwing dice behind the screen. And when you defeat monsters you get to draw treasure cards and gain items which will make you character stronger. You get also experience points and when you get enough of them, your character will rise in levels just as in any other RPG. There are also wizard and priest spells which can be cast to aid in combat.  Random deck has three kinds of cards; locations, special and skills. Special cards are random events which affect the player and gameplay, some good and some bad. Players can also get skills to make their character better. Locations are a very important part of the game. They are placed on the map of the game world and there are some rules in which order they can be owned. Also it`s not possible to own locations which are not connected by some way, either being adjacent in the map or connected by a portal for example. Locations also give you income, gold and mana points. Most cards have also a somekind discard value, so you can also sacrifice some card to get a temporary boost in battle. By owning locations players can climb the social ladder in the kingdom of Egion. Every player starts as a peasant, but when he/she owns enough locations and becomes a noble he/she can challenge the King. Becoming the King is the ultimate goal toward which the players strive for. Players have to help eachother to fight the creatures and become stronger, but at the same time they have to watch out that the other players don`t become too strong and maybe throw some curve balls their way. After all, there can be only one King!   The game setting is traditional fantasy. Typical character classes fighters, wizards etc. and spells and items are all there. It is hard to be very original and MECGE does not even try to be. Quite the opposite, the game is meant to have that traditional ""feeling"" and anyone who has played these kinds of games should learn it pretty easily. So basically it is suitable as an entry level game for people just getting to know RPG and it is also very good for not-so-serious gaming sessions where you can spend the evening with friends and maybe have few beverages while playing.    The pictures look nice. Who is the artist?So far there are pictures from over 60 different artists and there will still be even more. They range from hobbyists to professional artists. Some of them are already renowned and some are still making a name for themselves. They are all very talented and many of them have already worked in the gaming industry. Featured pictures show now their user names in deviantart (www.deviantart.com), but depending on individual wishes their real names may be on the printed cards. Some cards are in landscape orintation to better show off the beautiful artwork.What is the campaign goal?The goal of the campaign is to get the funding needed to 
arrange the printing of the game. If the goal is reached it will still take few months to finalize the game. The printing of
 the game would be done after that. Estimated time of delivery is Q4/2014.This is Fixed Funding, meaning that if the goal is not reached the contributions are refunded. Most printing companies have a minumum print run, so the goal has to be reached in order to make that minimum quantity for printing the game. Are there any plans for future development?If the funding is successfull a new company will be started to continue the development at a more professional level.Do you
think that some of the main stream game companies flood the games with new
sourcebooks and expansions all the time and you just can`t afford to keep up
even if you wanted to. The plan with MECGE is not do that. It is just not possible for a small
game company. And also we believe that the game will have to stay interesting
with just the basic sets and rules without having to push out new stuff all the
time. This does not mean that the game will not be developed at all. We do plan
to make new cards and expansions but at a pace which will not cause you to
spend all your money. And we plan also to listen to the players and learn in
which direction they would like to game to be developed. In our vision every
new addition to the game should be something to look forward to and spend the
night in queue like the new ""Lord of the Rings"" -movies or iPhones.
Are the
cards collectible some might ask, yes and no. Being the first edition and a
very small print run there isn`t a possibility to customize the decks, so every
copy of the game has got the same cards. That customization comes with
increased cost and it is only reasonable with long printing runs and we try to make
the game as affordable as possible. In the same time being a very small print
all the cards will be collectable if the game becomes successful. Think if you
would own cards from the very first printing of some very successful card game.
And if there would be longer printing runs later then there would also be cards
which are not as common as others. How can I help? Just simply by backing the campaign. If you can`t afford to do it, another way of helping is to spread the word and the funding link: in Facebook, Twitter, gaming and fantasy forums and everywhere else.Also, if you are interested in the game, please back the campaign rather sooner than later. In crowdfunding people only tend to back campaigns which look like are going to succeed. So in the early stages of the campaign it is hard to get those first backers and people not backing the campaign just because there aren`t many backers before them is a kind of a self fulfilling prophecy. Will be there any new perks and strech goals?Yes, definately! This is just to start the campaign and it will go on for 60 days. The possible perks are having your own RPG character being made immortal by making it a card or getting signed prints of the pictures or something like that.. Possible stretch goals are making some new booster packs or game modules and introducing new kingdoms and lands with some new creatures and items.It will be possible to change the selected perk later, so please do not wait until the last minute waiting for some new and better perks and strecth goals..",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

What is Off Da Railz?


It is a 3D game inspired by Snake where you play as a Train that has reached enlightenment and left the rails. Your purpose is to roam the world, looking for lonely lost carriages to join your flock. But you are not the only train out there, and they will all try to take from you what you own!

This game's prototype was designed by 7 people over the course of 8 weeks, and we are quite pleased with how well our original concept of '3D Snake' turned out! We've decided we'd really like this game to reach it's full potential!


We Need Your Help!


As it stands, our game has:

Functional networking - Clients see jittering, but doesn't affect gameplay.
2 train powerups - Shotgun and Haste
One arena map
One game mode - Carriage-tycoon.
One really wacky and amazing train.

We had a lot else planned that did not make it into the game in time, and the game in it's current form can't be called complete. We'd like to add at least the following features to the game :

More game modes! - such as 'Brawl' and 'Depot', our own spin on KotH and CTF
More trains! - different trains with unique stats and skills.
More powerups! - and tweaking existing ones. Shotgun isn't very exciting in it's current form.
Fixing up networking! - to make multiplayer as good an experience as possible!

<p>Creating a
videogame professionally needs a lot of money. Because I’m a college student,
let’s say that money is not a very common thing to see inside my wallet. But I
really want to finish this game and bring it to the world! But because this is
a solo project, I cannot make progress as much as I wish without the necessary
funding.</p>
<p>But with your

<p>Alright,
Breaking Bad jokes apart. Most of the funding will go into creating a unique
and original OST. We will hire a professional composer, Bruno Travis,
who will create the music for Panic-ko. The OST in a videogame is a very
important piece in order to create a good atmosphere, so that’s why we will invest
approximately 65% (aprox. 2000€) of the funding into the OST. </p>
<p>And the 35% left
of the funding will go directly to hire graphic designers to create more
enemies, design maps and illustrations for the game. With this, we can create a
more rich and interesting environment for Panic-ko.<span>  </span>                  </p>

survival horror game created with RPG maker that tells the story of a girl
named Kaori with a fragile heart condition. She has been locked up her whole
life in a small room in order to keep her safe and healthy from her unusual
illness. But one day, she gets out and finds herself in a dark and dangerous
place. Driven by curiosity, Kaori explores her surroundings, unveiling the
mystery behind the horrible events that happened in the place where she has
been imprisoned. 
This game is
inspired by titles like “Yume Nikki”, “Fragile Dreams” and “Fatal Frame. You
will need to go through many challenges, facing puzzles, persecutions and paranoia,
always with the omnipresent presence of the heart illness of Kaori that can
kill you at any moment. 
“What is the fear that makes you feel tiny and
vulnerable?”
Interesting, eh?
Isnt it?  Eh? Eeeeeeeehhhhhh?????????? 
Well, I have
good news. You can download the demo of the first chapter right here! Give it a
try, you will not regret it! (or maybe yes, lol)

<h2>日本語の概要</h2>
<p>2kB of Fun</p>
<p>76年〜85年における携帯ビデオゲームの素晴らしい世界</p>
<p>マルタイン・コッホ著</p>
<p>１９７６年から１９８５年の初期の携帯ゲーム機で、これほど贅沢な種類のケースデザインを誰もみたことがありませんでした。これらの携帯ゲーム機がもつ本質をこれまで美しくシンプルに出したコンピューターゲームはありませんでした。２ＫＢメモリーでこれほどまでの楽しみを提供できた例はなかったのです。</p>
<p>クラシック携帯ゲームの絶頂期から３０年が経ちました。１９８３年はアミダー、アストロサンダー7、バーガータイム、ディグダグ、ミズパックマン、キューバート、スーパーコブラ、ザクソンのようなゲームにとって最高の年でした。</p>
<p>オランダの建築家、マルタィン・コッホは２００に及ぶ優れた携帯ゲームを購入し、撮影、解体したのちに技術分析をし、研究後、今まで誰もみたことがない、素晴らしいカタログのような本にしました。</p>
<h2>2 kB of Fun</h2>
<p>I am <a href=""http://www.martijnkoch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Martijn Koch</a>, architect from the Netherlands with a passion for photography and product design. In 2009 I visited a vintage clothing shop in Osaka Japan with my girlfriend and while waiting I spotted the most awesome toy in a vintage toy cabinet: Epoch Astro Thunder 7. The guy behind the counter put in 4 C batteries and turned it on. I was smashed by the experience this toy from 1983 delivered. I immediately bought it.</p>
<p>One year later, I was building 26 <a href=""http://www.retrospace.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Retro Space</a> arcade cabinets for <a href=""http://www.dutchgamegarden.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dutch Game Garden's</a> <a href=""http://indigoshowcase.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indigo Showcase</a> in Utrecht, an incubator for the Dutch indie gaming industry. Next up was a job to redesign an old bank building to house 40 small gaming firms. To give the floors their own identity, I bought a couple of bright coloured handhelds from the early eighties and photographed them. They ended up being too retro for the interior, but they asked for a nice treatment! I was missing a true celebration of these magnificent toys from 1976-1985.</p>
<p><img alt=""Book front cover"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.retrospace.nl/cover_hd.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Book front cover""/></p>
<p><img alt=""Book rear cover"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.retrospace.nl/rearcover.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Book rear cover""/></p>
<p>The book I'm making is called 2kB of Fun, a combination of the joy these games offered and the magnificent feat that their designers managed to create arcade-like game play in 2kB of memory.</p>
<p>A classic printed book is still the best way to document this fantastic era of gaming toys. Print allows images with tons of details to be consumed at ease. ""Retina"" tablet displays allow better image reproduction than before, but not on par with print, and definitely not when it comes to the vector drawings included. We want to use BASF Novaspace F 2010 inks to make reproduction of the fantastic colours as nice as possible.</p>
<p>Dutch art book print and publishing firm <a href=""http://www.lecturis.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lecturis</a> will be partnering to make the experience as good as possible, it is 10 minutes on the bicycle away! We don't want to save a few bucks on off-shoring and have less hands-on opportunities to fine tune the printing process to offer the best.</p>
<p><img alt=""Sample spreads from the book"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.retrospace.nl/spreads_m.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Sample spreads from the book""/></p>
<p><em>Everybody that supports the book, can choose to get it with a supporters-only special edition cover and an autograph on the inside! If you plan to sell it in the future, everybody can see directly you were a backer! Please state in your backing message if you want a plain version.</em></p>
<p><em><img alt=""Backers edition cover"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/1005697_352215641572175_918798463_n.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Backers edition cover""/></em></p>
<p><em>Special backer edition cover<br/></em></p>
<h3>The games</h3>
<p>I started collecting. Thanks to informative websites by <a href=""http://www.handheldmuseum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rik Morgan</a> and <a href=""http://www.electronicplastic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jaro Gielens</a>, I was able to buy the absolute best games. I tried to collect entirely dedicated to the goal of the best documentation of the toys, with no interest in value and rarity, which led to weird situations like me desoldering a display on a 200€ Gakken Dig Dug (it still works!).</p>
<p>The selection is based on these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well known games: the ones everybody who played just one remembers</li>
<li>The most beautiful case designs</li>
<li>Excellent manufacturing quality</li>
<li>Exceptional technology</li>
<li>Great displays and sound</li>
<li>Awesome game experience. Which game pulls the most about the 2kB of ROM the microcontroller offered.</li>
</ul>
<p>The games were coming in and started to drive our reception lady nuts. My selection contains around 200 games and some related objects that are needed to place the story in its context. You will see exactly <em>what calculator</em> inspired Gunpei Yokoi on that bullet train ride to come up with the first Game&amp;Watch Nintendo Ball, and I will take it apart.</p>
<h2>Why I need your help</h2>
<p>I'm very good in the research, collecting tons of data, in making the best product photo's of these games, and in making awesome drawings to learn more about these toys, but there is more needed to get a book absolutely perfect. That's where you need to help me.</p>
<p>I need 15000€ to get the book press ready. This money is used for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rewriting of my 500 pages of rough text to perfect English</li>
<li>Translation of a summary for every game to Japanese</li>
<li>The actual layout of all 276 pages so I can focus on the best content</li>
<li>Professional lithography of the images to Novaspace CMYK</li>
<li>Making proofs and samples</li>
</ul>
<p>If I collect more than 15000€, I have some more ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Japanese or French interest is high, we are going to put the text on a separate black plate, so the big Handheld loving nations Japan and France can enjoy the full experience in their native language. I expect a lot of interest from France as it was the second handheld loving nation back in the day. Guess their bullet trains, nuclear power plants and Minitel pre-internet made them very greedy for Japanese toys. Please comment if you have interest in a native language.</li>
<li>I really want to crack the games code. If more money is collected, I have the intention to strip the most important microcontrollers, read their ROM's and learn about their magnificent compact code. We might even be able to make some true emulators. If you have tech gear to make this possible and want to cooperate, please let me know.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important reason to support the project is to help all the information escape my studio into the world the best way possible! That's why I do a fixed funding campaign. <strong>It is all or nothing! I am always after the best quality in my work.</strong></p>
<h3>What do I already have?</h3>
<h2><img alt=""Thumbnail banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/485526_343146259145780_525786311_n.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Thumbnails""/></h2>
<p>At the moment I have the following rough material</p>
<p>A database with all technical details. Accurate production dates, microcontrollers used, displays used, sprite counts, sizes, and much more. 500kB of SQL!</p>
<ul>
<li>200 high quality professionally made product photographs of all the games</li>
<li>1000 guts pictures I made when opening every single game. Where possible, I did not want to destroy games, but I made an exception for Auto Race, the first one from 1976!</li>
<li>60 FullHD game play video's made from decased games so no scratched plastic spoils the picture, with a distortion free macro lens on a DSLR for the best IQ.</li>
<li>10 cutaway vector drawings, each open and closed, for the most interesting games when it comes to technology used inside</li>
<li>20 electronic schemes that show exactly how these games worked, with detailed explanation of the technology</li>
<li>technical details of all the components used, how to interpret production numbers on chips and displays and much more nerdy stuff, and how everything relates to the original arcade games when applicable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Photo's</h3>
<p><img alt=""Gakken Puck Monster"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.retrospace.nl/photo1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Gakken Puck Monster""/></p>
<p>Early 2011 I started photographing them. After some research to photography technology I found the best way to photograph these games. Due to their relative small size and 3-dimensional character, the shape limits the amount of detail you can photograph, no matter you use a phone or a system camera! Diffraction limits collide with depth of field. Using a tilt-shift lens on a full frame camera turned out to deliver the best quality and flexibility.</p>
<p>I wanted the photographs to be as clean as possible. The objects should look like they are new, taken out of their original eighties themed surroundings. This way they make you wonder even more: did I live in that era? I must have missed something!</p>
<p>I try to capture the total 3D shape in one shot, using a mirror bottom to reveal nice details in the complex plastic molds.</p>
<p>The next step is the digital cleaning and repair. Working with small objects means you see every spot of dust and every scratch.

<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>I'm very good at making close deadlines, like I showed by creating 26 arcade cabinets in a month back in 2010, and doing the same for a 20 cab run in 2 weeks this year just in time for the Game Developer Conference, but I also want my products to be perfect. The goal is December 2013, but it might become early 2014. It would feel very bad to have you guys need to put vouchers under the Christmas tree.</p>
<h3>Shipping</h3>
<p>Shipping a 1.7kg book in a good way does not come cheap. That is why you need to add shipping costs to your perk amount. Because the book is as big as possibly fits a 2kg ""envelope"", the shipping is kept to a minimum. From the Netherlands, the postal service works with 3 regions:</p>

日本語の概要
2kB of Fun
76年〜85年における携帯ビデオゲームの素晴らしい世界
マルタイン・コッホ著
１９７６年から１９８５年の初期の携帯ゲーム機で、これほど贅沢な種類のケースデザインを誰もみたことがありませんでした。これらの携帯ゲーム機がもつ本質をこれまで美しくシンプルに出したコンピューターゲームはありませんでした。２ＫＢメモリーでこれほどまでの楽しみを提供できた例はなかったのです。
クラシック携帯ゲームの絶頂期から３０年が経ちました。１９８３年はアミダー、アストロサンダー7、バーガータイム、ディグダグ、ミズパックマン、キューバート、スーパーコブラ、ザクソンのようなゲームにとって最高の年でした。
オランダの建築家、マルタィン・コッホは２００に及ぶ優れた携帯ゲームを購入し、撮影、解体したのちに技術分析をし、研究後、今まで誰もみたことがない、素晴らしいカタログのような本にしました。
2 kB of Fun
I am Martijn Koch, architect from the Netherlands with a passion for photography and product design. In 2009 I visited a vintage clothing shop in Osaka Japan with my girlfriend and while waiting I spotted the most awesome toy in a vintage toy cabinet: Epoch Astro Thunder 7. The guy behind the counter put in 4 C batteries and turned it on. I was smashed by the experience this toy from 1983 delivered. I immediately bought it.
One year later, I was building 26 Retro Space arcade cabinets for Dutch Game Garden's Indigo Showcase in Utrecht, an incubator for the Dutch indie gaming industry. Next up was a job to redesign an old bank building to house 40 small gaming firms. To give the floors their own identity, I bought a couple of bright coloured handhelds from the early eighties and photographed them. They ended up being too retro for the interior, but they asked for a nice treatment! I was missing a true celebration of these magnificent toys from 1976-1985.


The book I'm making is called 2kB of Fun, a combination of the joy these games offered and the magnificent feat that their designers managed to create arcade-like game play in 2kB of memory.
A classic printed book is still the best way to document this fantastic era of gaming toys. Print allows images with tons of details to be consumed at ease. ""Retina"" tablet displays allow better image reproduction than before, but not on par with print, and definitely not when it comes to the vector drawings included. We want to use BASF Novaspace F 2010 inks to make reproduction of the fantastic colours as nice as possible.
Dutch art book print and publishing firm Lecturis will be partnering to make the experience as good as possible, it is 10 minutes on the bicycle away! We don't want to save a few bucks on off-shoring and have less hands-on opportunities to fine tune the printing process to offer the best.

Everybody that supports the book, can choose to get it with a supporters-only special edition cover and an autograph on the inside! If you plan to sell it in the future, everybody can see directly you were a backer! Please state in your backing message if you want a plain version.

Special backer edition cover
The games
I started collecting. Thanks to informative websites by Rik Morgan and Jaro Gielens, I was able to buy the absolute best games. I tried to collect entirely dedicated to the goal of the best documentation of the toys, with no interest in value and rarity, which led to weird situations like me desoldering a display on a 200€ Gakken Dig Dug (it still works!).
The selection is based on these criteria:

Well known games: the ones everybody who played just one remembers
The most beautiful case designs
Excellent manufacturing quality
Exceptional technology
Great displays and sound
Awesome game experience. Which game pulls the most about the 2kB of ROM the microcontroller offered.

The games were coming in and started to drive our reception lady nuts. My selection contains around 200 games and some related objects that are needed to place the story in its context. You will see exactly what calculator inspired Gunpei Yokoi on that bullet train ride to come up with the first Game&Watch Nintendo Ball, and I will take it apart.
Why I need your help
I'm very good in the research, collecting tons of data, in making the best product photo's of these games, and in making awesome drawings to learn more about these toys, but there is more needed to get a book absolutely perfect. That's where you need to help me.
I need 15000€ to get the book press ready. This money is used for the following:

Rewriting of my 500 pages of rough text to perfect English
Translation of a summary for every game to Japanese
The actual layout of all 276 pages so I can focus on the best content
Professional lithography of the images to Novaspace CMYK
Making proofs and samples

If I collect more than 15000€, I have some more ideas:

If Japanese or French interest is high, we are going to put the text on a separate black plate, so the big Handheld loving nations Japan and France can enjoy the full experience in their native language. I expect a lot of interest from France as it was the second handheld loving nation back in the day. Guess their bullet trains, nuclear power plants and Minitel pre-internet made them very greedy for Japanese toys. Please comment if you have interest in a native language.
I really want to crack the games code. If more money is collected, I have the intention to strip the most important microcontrollers, read their ROM's and learn about their magnificent compact code. We might even be able to make some true emulators. If you have tech gear to make this possible and want to cooperate, please let me know.

The most important reason to support the project is to help all the information escape my studio into the world the best way possible! That's why I do a fixed funding campaign. It is all or nothing! I am always after the best quality in my work.
What do I already have?

At the moment I have the following rough material
A database with all technical details. Accurate production dates, microcontrollers used, displays used, sprite counts, sizes, and much more. 500kB of SQL!

200 high quality professionally made product photographs of all the games
1000 guts pictures I made when opening every single game. Where possible, I did not want to destroy games, but I made an exception for Auto Race, the first one from 1976!
60 FullHD game play video's made from decased games so no scratched plastic spoils the picture, with a distortion free macro lens on a DSLR for the best IQ.
10 cutaway vector drawings, each open and closed, for the most interesting games when it comes to technology used inside
20 electronic schemes that show exactly how these games worked, with detailed explanation of the technology
technical details of all the components used, how to interpret production numbers on chips and displays and much more nerdy stuff, and how everything relates to the original arcade games when applicable.

The Photo's

Early 2011 I started photographing them. After some research to photography technology I found the best way to photograph these games. Due to their relative small size and 3-dimensional character, the shape limits the amount of detail you can photograph, no matter you use a phone or a system camera! Diffraction limits collide with depth of field. Using a tilt-shift lens on a full frame camera turned out to deliver the best quality and flexibility.
I wanted the photographs to be as clean as possible. The objects should look like they are new, taken out of their original eighties themed surroundings. This way they make you wonder even more: did I live in that era? I must have missed something!
I try to capture the total 3D shape in one shot, using a mirror bottom to reveal nice details in the complex plastic molds.
The next step is the digital cleaning and repair. Working with small objects means you see every spot of dust and every scratch. Only few games were mint boxed, so this means a lot of work to clean up the images. I guess 1000 hours of Photoshop stamping are in the project already. I don't use ""advanced"" modern pixel polish filters as they destroy the details.

Rezensionen dieser Modelle finden sich hier:HEER46 already offers a range of models in the 15mm/1:100 scale, which are considered to be of high quality.

Zur Verwirklichung des Projekts sind verschiedene Schritte notwendig. Dies beginnt mit dem Erstellen der Dateien für den 3-D Druck des Masters, setzt sich über die Anfertigung der Gussformen fort und endet schließlich mit der Produktion des finalen Bausatzes. Diese Schritte sind leider sehr kostenintensiv und von einer Person nicht so leicht zu stemmen, außerdem lässt sich so eher die Nachfrage einschätzen. Why this funding-campaign?The goal of the campaign is the production of the Panzerkampfwagen Löwe in 28mm/1:48 scale. The realization of this project necessitates several steps, beginning with the rendering of the files for the 3D-printing, leading to the production of the molds and concluding with the production of the final model-kit. Those steps are quite costly and for one person it´s not that easy to fund such a project. Also the funding-campaign allows us to gouge the demand.Der Löwe besteht aus mehreren Teilen, die aus Resin und Metall hergestellt werden.The Löwe consists of several parts, made of resin and metal.  Für den Löwen wird es zwei Modellvarianten zur Auswahl geben:Variante 1 ist der normale Panzerkampfwagen Löwe mit einer 10,5-cm Kanone.Variante 2 ist der Flak-Löwe mit einer 5,5cm Zwilling-Flak. You will be able to choose from two Löwe-versions: Version 1 is the standard Panzerkampfwagen Löwe with a 10,5 cm gun.Version 2 is the Flak-Löwe armed with a 5,5cm Twin-Flak. Etappenziel 1 = 2.000€Jeder Löwe-Bausatz erhält ein kostenfreies UHU-Infarotsystem. Stretchgoal 1 = 2.000€Each Löwe-kit gets an „UHU“ IR-system for free. Etappenziel 2 = 4.000€Beide Löwe-Varianten erhalten kostenfrei je eine weitere Kanone, die sich zwar nur optisch unterscheidet, aber perfekt zu einem sehr „staubigen“ Spiel passt. Variante 1 Alternative Kanone für den normalen Panzerkampfwagen Löwe.Variante 2 Alternative Kanone für den Flak-Löwe. Stretchgoal 2 = 4.000€Both Löwe-versions get an additional alternate cannon for free. Thedifference is purely optical, but fits in perfectly with a certain „dustified“game. Version 1Alternate cannon for the standard Panzerkampfwagen Löwe.Version 2 Alternate cannon for the Flak-Löwe.       Etappenziel 3 = 6.000€ Jeder Panzer braucht einen Kommandanten. Jeder Löwe-Bausatz erhält kostenfreieinen Panzerkommandanten „Max Wünsche"". Die Miniatur ist aus Metall und imMaßstab 28mm/1:48.Stretchgoal 3 = 6.000€Each tank needs a tank-commander.

Drive is a classic side-scrolling Action-RPG game that was made in retro style
to let player enjoy the familiarness and was combined with the action style of newer
game generation for the best balance.</p>

Dark
Drive was inspired by Metroid, Castlevania: Symphony of the night and Devil May
Cry. This game, Dark Drive, will make player explore the story scenario and
fight actively through it with the main character. We will do our best to make
Dark Drive become a memorable game.<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/401970/files/20140228233701-head2_why_indiegogo.png?1393659421"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>We
had been trying to create the concept of Dark Drive for a very long time while
we were having full-time jobs, and then after we had all the conclusions, we
decided that this game has potential and agreed to start the production
process. In order to develop Dark Drive, the Rambutan team assessed that we would
have to put all effort and concentrate all power on it.  We quit our jobs to make this project become
true. This project will take one year and we will require funds for the
followings:</p>
<p>- Software: Purchases of licensed software for developers.<br/>
- Sound Designer: For better sound quality, we have to hire a Sound Designer to
work with us.</p>

We choose
IndieGogo because we would like everyone to take a look at our project and be
the judge of whether ""Dark Drive"" should be created or not, and this is our main objective:<p></p><blockquote>""We will create enjoyable game which will make our players feel that it is
totally worth paying for.""</blockquote>

<p></p></div>","Weekly Update!We're working on video about weapon setting and control. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vne7iIWFi3UWE GOT GREENLIGHT!!!Dark
Drive is a classic side-scrolling Action-RPG game that was made in retro style
to let player enjoy the familiarness and was combined with the action style of newer
game generation for the best balance.

Dark
Drive was inspired by Metroid, Castlevania: Symphony of the night and Devil May
Cry. This game, Dark Drive, will make player explore the story scenario and
fight actively through it with the main character. We will do our best to make
Dark Drive become a memorable game.We
had been trying to create the concept of Dark Drive for a very long time while
we were having full-time jobs, and then after we had all the conclusions, we
decided that this game has potential and agreed to start the production
process. In order to develop Dark Drive, the Rambutan team assessed that we would
have to put all effort and concentrate all power on it.  We quit our jobs to make this project become
true. This project will take one year and we will require funds for the
followings:
- Software: Purchases of licensed software for developers.
- Sound Designer: For better sound quality, we have to hire a Sound Designer to
work with us.

We choose
IndieGogo because we would like everyone to take a look at our project and be
the judge of whether ""Dark Drive"" should be created or not, and this is our main objective:""We will create enjoyable game which will make our players feel that it is
totally worth paying for.""
""The Horizon... It is a gigantic fort in the space, 
built as a monumental symbol of power of
the mankind in the beginning of the 3rd Millennium 

and equipped with
assault machines and artificial intelligence able of developing weapons on
their own.""
After the construction was
completed and before its first debut, The Horizon was taken over and completely
controlled by a Union’s agent from R.A.A. (Risk Against Agent) unit, the agent No.1 whose codename
is Nate.
The
pursue of Nate and The Horizon is difficult due to the fort’s special ability
to space jump and its omnipotent camouflage system. The Union will have to use extreme
measures in order to recapture The Horizon.
They
will do it, even if The Horizon may suffer some damages.
Besides
seizing The Horizon, Nate also took a hostage, who is the daughter of
R.A.A. agent No.21, codename Spik. Nate secretly contacted Spik and, without
any explanation, made a negotiation with Spik which requires him to travel to
The Horizon. 
Therefore,
Spik decided to travel to The Horizon to rescue his daughter, and to find out
the reason behind Nate’s action.
WeaponThere are two types of weapons in this game, Melee Weapon and Ranged
Weapon. Player can match their weapons of choice and can freely change weapons. 

Ranged Weapon 
Ranged
weapon can attack an enemy from further distance.   
Melee
Weapon ComboMelee
weapon can make combo freely.    
Drive
SystemDrive
System is a special attack that has limited usage from Melee Weapon.    
UpgradeMelee
weapon, Ranged weapon, Drive system and Combo will eventually get their own
upgrades through the story progress of the game, for the fun of finding out
""What's the next upgrade will we get?"" Various Scenario
In
the adventure of finding the truth in ""The Horizon,"" you'll be faced
with many scenarios that have different settings and put you in various
situations. Gameplay will vary and become more challenging.

With our long years
of working in the game industry, this is the first big project we have ever
started on our own. We have begun the project since 3 months ago and now is the
time to drop everything else to fully concentrate on Dark Drive.

Every creative project must go through various obstacles. We often discuss
and debate in order to brainstorm better ideas to apply to our work. In the
end, we will achieve our goal.",89.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello! My name is Steve Shannon and I'm an aspiring game developer! I've been working on this project since about March of 2018. Although I've been in game development for about 2 years, this will be the first game I finish and release, gaining valuable experience in the industry. </p>
<p>Me and my friends are big fans of party games that can be played in local multiplayer and I'm excited to add to that genre. I have most of what I need for a fairly bare bones release, but I need funding to really do anything more. This game will be released regardless of funding, but with some extra money I can make it way better!</p>
<p>Honestly, I am not making this game for money. I spent a lot of my own money to get graphics and music going. <strong>I am making this game because I am passionate about video games and developing them.</strong> Any updates or additional content will likely be free. I appreciate it when game developers do that, and I want to reflect this behavior.</p>
<p>By donating, you can help make this game better for everyone. I would love to add many more mini games, and probably will in the future when I have more resources. This process will be expedited with your generous donations, directly translating to more content!</p>

Challenging, thought-provoking storyline featuring themes of power, corruption, social decay and systemic discrimination. The Nothing tells a tale about how our environment shapes us, and how we influence it in return.



Detective work. Collect evidence, interrogate witnesses, connect the dots and follow leads on your own. No hand-holding - move forward through the game by your own rules. Every case has numerous trails, and it’s up to you to decide which one to follow.
Special abilities. The Artifact is a unique ancient technology with unknown origins and purpose. If you learn how to use it, it might change the regular order or destroy it.

<span></span>Anyone who has backed a Crowdfunding before is well aware of some of the biggest risks with backing a project. I, myself, have backed over different projects, and through that, I've got an insight on some of the difficulties with running a successful project. These risks are well considered and steps have been taken to attempt to minimize them:<br/><br/>1.) Delays<br/>2.) Quality<br/>3.) Communication<br/><br/><b>Delays</b><br/>Let's be frank here; delays appear to be norm rather than the exception. The reason for this one can only speculate in, which I will not do. I will instead give you my take on delays for this specific project.<br/><br/>This project is focused around raising funds for creation and manufacturing miniatures, and because of this, there will be some risks involved with it. The risk comes from partners not being able to deliver on target. There are concept artists and illustrators, there are sculptors, there are casters, and then there are the different shipping companies. If one link in the chain breaks, it will obviously affect the rest.<br/><br/>However, these types of delays should not be a problem. The miniatures are sculpted and they have been cast in a number of copies already (7 of the 9/10 miniatures have been sculpted). The turn-around of this project should because of that be quite short for the first backers; and then shipping will go out in waves. Because of this I am confident that I will be able to meet the projected estimated delivery date for all backers!<br/><br/>Please be aware that none of the stretch goals are included in any of the sculpted miniatures. This means that if a stretch goal is reached a sculptor needs to be commissioned for it and then it needs to be sculpted. This could potentially mean delays simply because it being outsourced to third parties.<br/><br/><b>Quality</b><br/>There are always some concerns regarding the quality of material used for casting. For this project, I have worked together with a skilled caster with extended knowledge of the casting process. The resin is of high quality, holds detail great and is sturdy (for being resin). However, like always when it concerns resin there will always be the risk of it breaking in transit. I will do my best to ensure the miniature is well-protected when sending it to you to reduce this risk.<br/><b><br/>Communication</b><br/>I am dedicated to this project and will do my best to be reachable to answer any questions; both during and after the project ends. Of course, there will always be the risk that something unforeseen occurs on a personal level but as long as everything proceeds as expected, you can trust in easy and fast access to me with any and all your inquiries.<br/><br/><br/><h3><br/></h3>

Today, we present the new line of resin
miniatures of 35mm height at eyes sight. It was fun and toilsome. Now that we
have finished these characters, we would like to continue design more models
and pedestals for painters, collectors and players wishing to expand their display
case with our models, which is why we need your help.
WHY THE NAME ""DARK FANTASY &
CREATURES""?
Besides being one of our favourite themes,
this collection focuses on characters, creatures and rather dark legends.
Some characters are fantastic cut (Sorcerers,
wizards and heroes in general) with a touch of symbols and more gothic-dark
details.

Most of our creatures and monsters (vampires,
werewolves, Undead...) are inspired by the mhyts and legends more known giving
a slightly more updated approach.




We
have than 10 models of miniatures for the campaign. The miniatures are
designed in 35mm scale and are supplied with a base of PVC (unassembled). We
are also considering the possibility of including a little personalised insert
scenic base for each character

Anyone who has backed a Crowdfunding before is well aware of some of the biggest risks with backing a project. I, myself, have backed over different projects, and through that, I've got an insight on some of the difficulties with running a successful project. These risks are well considered and steps have been taken to attempt to minimize them:1.) Delays2.) Quality3.) CommunicationDelaysLet's be frank here; delays appear to be norm rather than the exception. The reason for this one can only speculate in, which I will not do. I will instead give you my take on delays for this specific project.This project is focused around raising funds for creation and manufacturing miniatures, and because of this, there will be some risks involved with it. The risk comes from partners not being able to deliver on target. There are concept artists and illustrators, there are sculptors, there are casters, and then there are the different shipping companies. If one link in the chain breaks, it will obviously affect the rest.However, these types of delays should not be a problem. The miniatures are sculpted and they have been cast in a number of copies already (7 of the 9/10 miniatures have been sculpted). The turn-around of this project should because of that be quite short for the first backers; and then shipping will go out in waves. Because of this I am confident that I will be able to meet the projected estimated delivery date for all backers!Please be aware that none of the stretch goals are included in any of the sculpted miniatures. This means that if a stretch goal is reached a sculptor needs to be commissioned for it and then it needs to be sculpted. This could potentially mean delays simply because it being outsourced to third parties.QualityThere are always some concerns regarding the quality of material used for casting. For this project, I have worked together with a skilled caster with extended knowledge of the casting process. The resin is of high quality, holds detail great and is sturdy (for being resin). However, like always when it concerns resin there will always be the risk of it breaking in transit. I will do my best to ensure the miniature is well-protected when sending it to you to reduce this risk.CommunicationI am dedicated to this project and will do my best to be reachable to answer any questions; both during and after the project ends. Of course, there will always be the risk that something unforeseen occurs on a personal level but as long as everything proceeds as expected, you can trust in easy and fast access to me with any and all your inquiries.",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Our goal is to develop<strong> a hardcore mobile game</strong> with a rapid and exciting gameplay that will keep players on their toes. In Outback Defender you don’t have to be a racer to win. You need to be smart. Build effective strategy, think tactics through, and use the following game mechanics to your advantage:</div>
<div> </div>
</div><h3>Game Active Pause (G.A.P.)</h3><p>For Pinkpunk and his mates everything's moving really fast, but you don’t have to be as quick as lightning.<strong> Use game active pause (GAP) to slow your enemies down. </strong>This will give you enough time to relocate your squad, choose their targets and check the area for something useful, bombs for example.</p><h3>Сhoice of aiming point</h3><p><strong>You can choose a body part of your enemy </strong>that you want to hit, shooting of a paw will slow enemies down, hitting the jaw will decrease damage, and a headshot will stop it for good. Every shot has a success probability that differs depending on the weapon you are using and character you are controlling.</p><h3>Enemy’s weak points</h3><p><strong>Every enemy has its weak points</strong>, for example headshot for a radbit is a guaranteed critical hit, while shooting at the head of a Giant Yellow Ant — Mads would be almost senseless since it is covered with armour. As you play the game, you learn your enemy’s weak spots and feel your skills growing.</p><h3>Mini-games</h3><p>Sometimes Pinkpunk and his mates have to <strong>hack the computer or break a lock. </strong>In this wasted world there is no more private property! In reward they’ll get valuable item or additional information!</p><h3>Variety of Missions</h3><p>No rest for the wicked! Pinkpunk and his buddies won’t have time to relax. Easy ’just kill’em all‘ missions will give way to stealth missions and “Dodge the radioactive bull” missions, defense missions, fights with bosses and more.</p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510143572/xlzs37n4t4gdnuhpo3ld.png"" src=""""/></h2><h3>Pinkpunk</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://jpegshare.net/images/a5/5e/a55ec58a35f75c78c8176395093bc59e.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>A mysterious swagman.

Every shot has a success probability that differs depending on the weapon you are using and character you are controlling.Enemy’s weak pointsEvery enemy has its weak points, for example headshot for a radbit is a guaranteed critical hit, while shooting at the head of a Giant Yellow Ant — Mads would be almost senseless since it is covered with armour. As you play the game, you learn your enemy’s weak spots and feel your skills growing.Mini-gamesSometimes Pinkpunk and his mates have to hack the computer or break a lock. In this wasted world there is no more private property! In reward they’ll get valuable item or additional information!Variety of MissionsNo rest for the wicked! Pinkpunk and his buddies won’t have time to relax. Easy ’just kill’em all‘ missions will give way to stealth missions and “Dodge the radioactive bull” missions, defense missions, fights with bosses and more.PinkpunkA mysterious swagman. There is no verified information on where he came from. Roams the wastelands on his own, earns a living by selling loot. Cares only for himself, but a ruthless warrior is always a good mate when it comes to survival. His favorite song: Shoot to Thrill by AC/DC and he kinda’ doesn’t like birds. Well he actually freaking hates them!Class: tankSkills: close combatWeapon of choice: shotgun MickA sniper, born and raised in the Outback, but he can’t stand it. He actually hates everything, and trusts no one but his rifle. Claims that he never misses. Disregarding thefact that he constantly complains about everything, he is  always a desired member of the team, in case you want to survive.Class: sniperSkills: enhanced aimWeapon of choice: sniper rifle KoarraA Quii that was born on Earth, in the town called Alice Springs. Her father left them before she was even born and her mother perished in anti-Quii riots, that is still a usual thing in major cities. Koarra was adopted by local scientist known as Professor. He taught her all that he knew about Quii and their technology and told her about hoards that Quii made before the war. After professor died Koarra continued to search for alien treasures.Class: ScientistSkills: hackingWeapon of choice: alien blaster   More the 50 years have passed since the Quii mothership crash landed on Earth, completely destroying the environment, spreading radioactive pollution and alien DNA all over the planet. Now the Outback is crawling with radioactive mutants, alien creatures and even crossbreeds of terrestrial and alien DNA. You can also expect violent gangsters, that have no respect for the human life and squads of mutated humans.

 MOUNT MARYIt used to be small town by the road, but suffered heavy damage during the war. Expect packs of Atuu and ubiquitous radbits. NEW ANTHILL OF THE ROCKY OUTBACK:Mighty mads made tunnels in the rocks, some radbit’s holes were also reported here. ROCKY OUTBACKTypical landscape of the Outback, expect packs of radbits and probably some mads. OASISThis place might look like a piece of heaven comparing to the rest of the Outback. But trust us, this is very deceiving. Among other dangers here you can meet hundreds of cockatoos. Scavenger-cockatoos, beautiful and deadly. Kids like to come here to collect feathers. There are many blinded kids in a nearby town. ABANDONED HOUSEThis house is so damaged that we can only guess, what was its purpose before. This might look like a nice place for a rest. What bad can happen? THE BRIDGEThis Bridge is very important strategic point between territories of Dingo Gang and Mutants of the Balance. Sound’s like a lot of troubles, right? You wouldn’t go there, mate, would you?  Crazy Radbits Squad — is a union of wisdom of experienced Team Lead (11 years in Gamedev) and enthusiasm of young newbies. For some of us this is the first serious game project, but with help and support from Polygon and with wise guidance of our team lead we are more than ready to fulfill our goals. We visit additional courses, workshops, conferences, showcases and hackathons to gain experience and collect feedback. We fall asleep and we wake up with the name of Pinkpunk on our lips, we are incredibly determined to make a game that we all will be proud of, including you. “I always loved games, since my childhood. Fallout is one of the first games, which I hung out for hours. Then I dreamed to create 3D cartoons. I am a developer and I have been making games for 11 years, 5 years of which in Unity. All this time, one way or another I worked on game design. And by the chance, I got into my first game development company and I realised that it was my mission”“I have been working on games for 1,5 years. Most of all I like the genre of post-apocalypse, because it allows you to create an interesting and alternative world. We can review and even rewrite the history of places, things and peoples. We can tell people really cool stories. I associate myself with Koarra. She is independent, sarcastic and she can survive in “the world of men”“Since my childhood I’ve loved video games, collected consoles and games for them. So, I decided to realise my childhood dream in adulthood — to develop games and be a part of this industry. I’m crazy about Australia and hardcore, so my favourite hero is Pinkpunk”“My favourite fighter is an alien assassin, who isn’t in the game yet. He will be a really cool character, so I would like to play for him. I always dreamed to create virtual worlds. I looked for new opportunities and improved my skills. And now I just do what I really like — I create levels of the game for Outback”“Before joining this project I mainly worked on hard surface models and environment models. So, it’s my first project where I work on characters. I love it, because I can prove myself, there is much more creativity than in hard surfaces. Especially I like monsters. As for me, I would like to play for Koarra, she is the only woman character in our setting! Glory to female power!”“Our characters don’t have any prototypes — all ideas come to my mind. I have been creating concept for games only for 1,5 years, however I love games since my childhood. It can be said that I’m a fan of my job. And, of course, my favourite character is brutal and harsh Pinkpunk”“I’m working on arts, UI-prototypes and a few characters’ concepts. I also create comics for the game. I like hardcore of Outback, post apocalypse and realistic graphics. And it so amazing that I would like to travel to Australia and cross the desert by myself” Outback Defender came to life as a project at Polygon Game Lab. Polygon is an educational centre for gamedev and CG in Minsk, Belarus. It is a wonderful place where experienced professionals share their knowledge and skills with aspiring artists and developers. Polygon Game Lab is a place where creators can meet, form teams and initiate projects, best projects receive mentorship and support to reach a particular milestone. Outback defender happens to be the first project of PGL to reach its goal.Within the last six months we have proven to be a wonderful team. Now we are Crazy Radbits Squad - a young studio, that is willing to write our name in history of gamedev with blood, sweat and tears.We are raising money on Indiegogo to deliver the first chapter of the game. It will have up to 10 levels, with all our ideas implemented. With your help we will create assets we can use to expand the game, adding more chapters on a regular basis. We hope to achieve this within 3 months after the end of the campaign. The funds will be used to support our team for the 3 months period. Polygon is providing us with office space and hardware, and as graduates of PGL we were presented with licenses for all necessary software.",32.0,2,"1 Campaign

Unlike cycling disciplines, where endurance, strength and a few tactics ensure successful riding, MTB requires serious controlling skills, good reaction speed, quick trail reading and trajectory selection skills. All this makes the MTB an ideal subject for creating a simulation computer game. But if you try to look for such simulators, you will not find any. There are several games dedicated to MTB, but they are very far from what the real MTB is in terms of physics, control, and the structure of the tracks.</p><p>The aim of this project is to create a simulation game that implements a physically accurate (to the extent that it affects our perception) modeling of the rider-bike-environment system. The environment will be represented by three bike parks with various MTB trails of different type and difficulty. You will be able to ride at least five different bikes on challenging terrain and tune them.</p><p>The game will attract all those who are passionate about mountain biking, as they will enjoy playing when they can’t go outside to the mountains. The simulator will allow you to engage in your favorite activity in winter, in the rain or during the injury rehabilitation period. For those ones who follow the rule “no dig no ride” this project provides a unique chance! Pledging from 25 euros you will get not only the game but also the trail editor, where you can verify all your ideas in virtual environment before you bring them to the real trails! For those players who like racing games the MTB Game offers a completely new kind of virtual racing experience.</p><p>The project description is structured according to the following plan:</p><ul>

</ul><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Demo version</h2><p>I have developed MTB simulator for a while as a free time solo project. The result is the first working prototype - MTB Game Demo, running on Windows OS. The demo version presents the MTB school, which includes nine learning trails, providing training in passing flat corners, berms, bumps, riding bridges, jumping drops and kickers.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559202231/hdx9q90acx7jkzy0yr0n.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The demo version can be downloaded from the <a href=""https://www.mtbsimulator.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">game website</a>. This version presents a simplified mathematical bike-rider model, which has several limitations. The video below shows the fragments of riding along the MTB school trails (from easy to difficult):</p><div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/jntHCttYlYI?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>The automatic balance control system is the only automatic assistant in the demo version. It controls the muscles of the rider’s arms to turn the handlebar at the required speed in the direction of the fall. This is not enough to fully control the bike (see the Physics and Control Section), but since the MTB school’s trails have a relatively simple terrain, it is possible to go through all of them if you have a joystick. The video below reveals some details of installation, controls, gameplay and settings in the demo version:</p>
</div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/sObNXLI1cMg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>In addition to the simulator mode, a mode with arcade physics is included in the demo version of the game, which greatly simplifies control and allows you to pass school lessons without a joystick:</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELhvezNTxhM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Content editors</h2><p>To make possible content creation for the game I have developed several auxiliary programs for internal use. The main two are the Bike Editor and the Map Editor.</p><p>The Bike Editor allows you to assemble a bike from various parts, define the connections of these parts, and determine their physical parameters. Also, you can check whether the parts of the bike interact correctly with each other:</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/DGwKBStcTn8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>The Map Editor is a program for creating bike parks. It allows you to lay tracks. For tracks, you can edit the width, slope, profile, add holes, bumps and dirt kickers. In addition to tracks, the editor allows you to spread stones, trees and roots on the map. Roots can also be generated automatically. Wooden bridges of various shapes and sizes can also be built using the editor:</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/nWwqlsjFQxo?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>The work on The Map Editor is not finished and I am going to add the following functions:</p><ol>
<li>Placement of arbitrary objects defined by 3D models.</li>
<li>Automatic generation of brake bumps, ruts and protruding faces of stones.</li>
<li>Setting the typical MTB dirt constructions parametrically, rather than manipulating the points of the trail manually.</li>
</ol><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Gameplay</h2><h3>1. Basic Game Modes</h3><p>Basic game modes are modes that will be implemented even in case of minimum amount of raised funds.</p><p><strong>1.1. School mode.</strong> Demo version shows an example of this mode. The player will consistently go through nine lessons, honing important skills in overcoming a certain type of obstacles. The school mode is an obligatory stage on the way to the following modes. At the start, the player does not have his own bike: a learning bike that is most suitable for the lesson objectives will be provided. According to the results of each lesson, the player will get an A, B or C mark, depending on the tasks completed. At the end, a certificate and an in-game cash reward are issued. The player can spend this reward on his first bike to ride in the following modes.</p><p><strong>1.2. Mission Mode</strong> is the main game mode. It consists of passing tracks in bike parks. Three different bike parks will be implemented with ten tracks of different complexity (green, blue, black, double black, pro) in each. As a result of passing each track, the player will receive a bronze, silver or gold medal and the in-game cash reward. The time of passing each track will be saved in the online table of records, so it will be possible to compete with people around the world. The in-game cash reward can be used to buy new bikes or upgrade existing ones.</p><p><strong>1.3. Free Play Mode</strong> After all the missions of one park are completed with bronze, silver or gold medals, the park becomes available for free playing. The player will be able to place his bike anywhere in the park (both on the track and off-track) using the locator map. In addition to the missions’ routes, the parks will contain connection roads joining tracks into a single network, as well as certain challenging zones. Such zones can be pump tracks, dirt lines or a series of drops of different sizes.</p><h3>2. Additional Modes</h3><p>If the project funding exceeds the established minimum (see Section “Basic and Stretch Goals”), additional modes will be implemented:</p><p><strong>2.1. The Replay Video View Mode.</strong> This mode allows you to view the results of races completed and saved earlier. When viewing races, it will be possible to change the cameras and control them in an arbitrary manner; a stationary tracking camera will also be available.</p><p><strong>2.2. Enduro Mode.</strong> This mode presents a passage of three/four downhill stages linked by connection roads in free play bike parks. In this mode, the players will compete for the total time of all downhill stages. The time will be entered in online record tables.</p><p><strong>2.3. Contactless Multiplayer.</strong> In this mode, you can compete with other people on the tracks. In this case, rivals will be visible, but contacts with them will not be processed.</p><h3>3. Bikes</h3><p>The game will provide an opportunity to select and upgrade bikes for the in-game money received as a result of passing the school and missions. The number of bikes that will be available in the game is not determined. The minimum number of bikes is five, one for each discipline of MTB: downhill, enduro, trail, cross-country, street/dirt.</p><p>The following bike parts will be replaceable: fork, rear shock, tires, spring in the fork, spring in the rear shock absorber. New parts will also be available for in-game money.</p><p>The bike can be tuned. The number of settings will depend on the installed fork and rear shock absorber. The general list of things to be adjusted: the pressure in the air chamber, low and high-speed compression and rebound in the fork and rear shock absorber, tire pressure.</p><h3>4. Riders</h3><p>Right now there is only one rider in the game. There is no time to implement function of a rider customization with different clothes or protection gear during the project. But if the project budget will allow to delegate part of the responsibilities to other people, then some customization will be available. One of the possible rewards for backers is creating their own design of a rider.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Physics and Control</h2><p>The environment and simplified bike-rider mathematical models are ready and debugged in the demo version of the game. They allow you to implement all the settings of the suspension and bicycle tires. This simplified bike-rider mathematical model does not contain all required degrees of freedom, so it will be amplified to full bike-rider mathematical model by adding missing degrees of freedom.</p><p>Following videos show some physical aspects of the simulator. Here you can see how suspension settings affect the behavior of a bike:</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/UoHPcPtPq50?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>The next video demonstrates the influence of aerodynamics on bike behavior:</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rm3pptyjiME?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>Work on control is the most important and time-consuming part of this project. The complexity of the implementation of control is the main reason for the lack of MTB simulators up to the present. The fact is that to control the bike you need to control a couple dozen bones of the rider with more than five dozen muscles. If you compare this with a car simulator that is controlled by a steering wheel, three pedals and a gear shift knob, the difference becomes obvious. In a car, the driver’s movement through the cabin can be neglected, but on a bike every movement is important, every degree of freedom of the skeleton (except, perhaps, for individual fingers and facial muscles) affects control. Another problem is that the bike does not have static stability, so even to go straight you need a coordinated work of many muscles. That is why in order to create a bicycle simulator, it is necessary to develop a layer of artificial neural networks that allow the player’s high-level commands to be translated into the work of the rider's muscles.</p><p>In the demo version, this layer is represented by a system of maintaining balance in motion, which is the necessary minimum for controlling a bike. The following video is about the work of this system:</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/vBeyDPu9Cjw?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>The system of maintaining balance in motion is not enough for reliable control of the bike. During the project, at least two more automatic systems will be developed - a weight distribution system and a rough terrain processing system.</p><p>The weight distribution system will automatically distribute the rider's weight between the grips and the pedals by controlling the tension of the muscles and shifting the rider’s body. This will increase the stability of the bike when cornering, increase the accuracy of holding the required angle of inclination and allow the rider to keep his balance at low and zero speeds.</p><p>The rough terrain processing system will be responsible for the relaxation and tension of the muscles in order to compensate for the rapid impacts of the terrain. If slow impacts such as hitting a kicker or pumping a smooth bump can be processed directly by the player, then processing of rough and rapid impacts should fall on the shoulders of the automatic system. This will improve the stability of the bike on the tracks with many holes, roots, stones and brake bumps. Accordingly, it will be possible to add more obstacles of this kind to the tracks. In the demo version, the rough terrain is almost absent since such a terrain cannot yet be processed by the rider.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Graphics</h2><p>At the current stage of the project the graphics is not the most important component, and the quantity and quality of improvements in this direction will be determined by the remaining time for the project. However, there are several things that I plan to do:</p><p>1. Grass display will be enhanced. In the MTB Game Demo, each blade of grass is represented by a separate geometry, which causes a few performance and aliasing issues. It is possible instead to display grass with textured geometry blocks, and the size of the blocks will vary depending on the distance to the observer. It will solve performance and aliasing problems. Using textures of different grass types will also increase the visual diversity.</p><p>2. The visual appearance of trails will be improved. In the MTB Game Demo, trails are represented by regular tiled textures, which often create noticeable repetitive patterns. To avoid this, mixing different types of textures for the center and edges of the trails, as well as textures that add additional random details, could be used.</p><p>3. Forest textures will be added to represent far forests: that will improve the background quality.</p><p>4. Each bike park in the game will contain its own unique set of tree types, roots, rocks and trail surfaces.</p><p>5. There will be a general optimization of the rendering process, which will ensure the highest possible performance. This is especially important for the implementation of a virtual reality mode.</p><p>Images below shows what graphics exists at the current moment:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559219927/ykzvbwfupf5sgvhybudg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Sound</h2><p>The sound system in the game supports all the necessary types of sounds that bike can produce. At the moment there are no sound files representing the set of sounds. In the MTB Game Demo, all the variety of sounds is represented by a few simple sounds recorded on a smartphone at home. I am going to purchase the necessary recording equipment to record high quality real bike sounds.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Virtual Reality</h2><p>Mountain bike simulator is an application where virtual reality fits perfectly. This applies both to a more complete perception of the tracks with their surface in stereo mode, and to the control that can be implemented with the help of virtual reality controllers very similar to the actual control of the bike. The diagram shows how to control a bike using VR controllers:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/380a4c_175e8b6cdd0b4d478b4db89a0346828a~mv2.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>If there are no VR controllers, the standard joystick controls can be used. The demo version of MTB Game Demo does not support virtual reality, but to get an idea of how the game will look like in this mode, video tracks in VR 180 3D format were rendered.</p><p>Video fragments from the external camera (00:00-04:22 - simulator mode, 04:22-08:17 - arcade mode):</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/okmxjWHgRg8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p><a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WNXi2_6gItpkW1sn0Ffg-5ojUjZKEbGk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Download with larger bitrate</a></p><p>Video fragments from the helmet camera (00:00-05:37 - simulator mode, 05:37-09:20 - arcade mode):</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yOC6dN-xfAU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p><a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wsRpbOI8YCTkhicmkr6Xrj6XQL_iyV2F"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Download with larger bitrate</a></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Basic and Stretch Goals</h2><p>This section contains the main project implementation tasks described earlier.

A lot of work has been done, and more needs to be done. Careful analysis shows that I need 14 months of full time work to complete the project. Unfortunately, I cannot work on this project full time, as I need to cover my living expenses. Working 1-2 hours a day instead of desirable 8-10 slows down the process. Successful IndieGoGo campaign will help me to discard all other concerns and focus exclusively on the project. It will be a great motivation to work harder and release a high quality unique game if the IndieGoGo shows that there are lots of people interested in the project! It is always exciting to know that something you do is important to many other people. I strongly hope that IndieGoGo campaign will attract people willing to create their own bikes and trails to extend game experience.

Unlike cycling disciplines, where endurance, strength and a few tactics ensure successful riding, MTB requires serious controlling skills, good reaction speed, quick trail reading and trajectory selection skills. All this makes the MTB an ideal subject for creating a simulation computer game. But if you try to look for such simulators, you will not find any. There are several games dedicated to MTB, but they are very far from what the real MTB is in terms of physics, control, and the structure of the tracks.The aim of this project is to create a simulation game that implements a physically accurate (to the extent that it affects our perception) modeling of the rider-bike-environment system. The environment will be represented by three bike parks with various MTB trails of different type and difficulty. You will be able to ride at least five different bikes on challenging terrain and tune them.The game will attract all those who are passionate about mountain biking, as they will enjoy playing when they can’t go outside to the mountains. The simulator will allow you to engage in your favorite activity in winter, in the rain or during the injury rehabilitation period. For those ones who follow the rule “no dig no ride” this project provides a unique chance! Pledging from 25 euros you will get not only the game but also the trail editor, where you can verify all your ideas in virtual environment before you bring them to the real trails! For those players who like racing games the MTB Game offers a completely new kind of virtual racing experience.The project description is structured according to the following plan:

About me
Demo versionI have developed MTB simulator for a while as a free time solo project. The result is the first working prototype - MTB Game Demo, running on Windows OS. The demo version presents the MTB school, which includes nine learning trails, providing training in passing flat corners, berms, bumps, riding bridges, jumping drops and kickers.The demo version can be downloaded from the game website. This version presents a simplified mathematical bike-rider model, which has several limitations. The video below shows the fragments of riding along the MTB school trails (from easy to difficult):

The automatic balance control system is the only automatic assistant in the demo version. It controls the muscles of the rider’s arms to turn the handlebar at the required speed in the direction of the fall. This is not enough to fully control the bike (see the Physics and Control Section), but since the MTB school’s trails have a relatively simple terrain, it is possible to go through all of them if you have a joystick. The video below reveals some details of installation, controls, gameplay and settings in the demo version:
In addition to the simulator mode, a mode with arcade physics is included in the demo version of the game, which greatly simplifies control and allows you to pass school lessons without a joystick: Content editorsTo make possible content creation for the game I have developed several auxiliary programs for internal use. The main two are the Bike Editor and the Map Editor.The Bike Editor allows you to assemble a bike from various parts, define the connections of these parts, and determine their physical parameters. Also, you can check whether the parts of the bike interact correctly with each other:The Map Editor is a program for creating bike parks. It allows you to lay tracks. For tracks, you can edit the width, slope, profile, add holes, bumps and dirt kickers. In addition to tracks, the editor allows you to spread stones, trees and roots on the map. Roots can also be generated automatically. Wooden bridges of various shapes and sizes can also be built using the editor:The work on The Map Editor is not finished and I am going to add the following functions:
Placement of arbitrary objects defined by 3D models.
Automatic generation of brake bumps, ruts and protruding faces of stones.
Setting the typical MTB dirt constructions parametrically, rather than manipulating the points of the trail manually.
Gameplay1. Basic Game ModesBasic game modes are modes that will be implemented even in case of minimum amount of raised funds.1.1. School mode. Demo version shows an example of this mode. The player will consistently go through nine lessons, honing important skills in overcoming a certain type of obstacles. The school mode is an obligatory stage on the way to the following modes. At the start, the player does not have his own bike: a learning bike that is most suitable for the lesson objectives will be provided. According to the results of each lesson, the player will get an A, B or C mark, depending on the tasks completed. At the end, a certificate and an in-game cash reward are issued. The player can spend this reward on his first bike to ride in the following modes.1.2. Mission Mode is the main game mode. It consists of passing tracks in bike parks. Three different bike parks will be implemented with ten tracks of different complexity (green, blue, black, double black, pro) in each. As a result of passing each track, the player will receive a bronze, silver or gold medal and the in-game cash reward. The time of passing each track will be saved in the online table of records, so it will be possible to compete with people around the world. The in-game cash reward can be used to buy new bikes or upgrade existing ones.1.3. Free Play Mode After all the missions of one park are completed with bronze, silver or gold medals, the park becomes available for free playing. The player will be able to place his bike anywhere in the park (both on the track and off-track) using the locator map. In addition to the missions’ routes, the parks will contain connection roads joining tracks into a single network, as well as certain challenging zones. Such zones can be pump tracks, dirt lines or a series of drops of different sizes.2. Additional ModesIf the project funding exceeds the established minimum (see Section “Basic and Stretch Goals”), additional modes will be implemented:2.1. The Replay Video View Mode. This mode allows you to view the results of races completed and saved earlier. When viewing races, it will be possible to change the cameras and control them in an arbitrary manner; a stationary tracking camera will also be available.2.2. Enduro Mode. This mode presents a passage of three/four downhill stages linked by connection roads in free play bike parks. In this mode, the players will compete for the total time of all downhill stages. The time will be entered in online record tables.2.3. Contactless Multiplayer. In this mode, you can compete with other people on the tracks. In this case, rivals will be visible, but contacts with them will not be processed.3. BikesThe game will provide an opportunity to select and upgrade bikes for the in-game money received as a result of passing the school and missions. The number of bikes that will be available in the game is not determined. The minimum number of bikes is five, one for each discipline of MTB: downhill, enduro, trail, cross-country, street/dirt.The following bike parts will be replaceable: fork, rear shock, tires, spring in the fork, spring in the rear shock absorber. New parts will also be available for in-game money.The bike can be tuned. The number of settings will depend on the installed fork and rear shock absorber. The general list of things to be adjusted: the pressure in the air chamber, low and high-speed compression and rebound in the fork and rear shock absorber, tire pressure.4. RidersRight now there is only one rider in the game. There is no time to implement function of a rider customization with different clothes or protection gear during the project. But if the project budget will allow to delegate part of the responsibilities to other people, then some customization will be available. One of the possible rewards for backers is creating their own design of a rider.Physics and ControlThe environment and simplified bike-rider mathematical models are ready and debugged in the demo version of the game. They allow you to implement all the settings of the suspension and bicycle tires. This simplified bike-rider mathematical model does not contain all required degrees of freedom, so it will be amplified to full bike-rider mathematical model by adding missing degrees of freedom.Following videos show some physical aspects of the simulator. Here you can see how suspension settings affect the behavior of a bike:The next video demonstrates the influence of aerodynamics on bike behavior:Work on control is the most important and time-consuming part of this project. The complexity of the implementation of control is the main reason for the lack of MTB simulators up to the present. The fact is that to control the bike you need to control a couple dozen bones of the rider with more than five dozen muscles. If you compare this with a car simulator that is controlled by a steering wheel, three pedals and a gear shift knob, the difference becomes obvious. In a car, the driver’s movement through the cabin can be neglected, but on a bike every movement is important, every degree of freedom of the skeleton (except, perhaps, for individual fingers and facial muscles) affects control. Another problem is that the bike does not have static stability, so even to go straight you need a coordinated work of many muscles. That is why in order to create a bicycle simulator, it is necessary to develop a layer of artificial neural networks that allow the player’s high-level commands to be translated into the work of the rider's muscles.In the demo version, this layer is represented by a system of maintaining balance in motion, which is the necessary minimum for controlling a bike. The following video is about the work of this system:The system of maintaining balance in motion is not enough for reliable control of the bike. During the project, at least two more automatic systems will be developed - a weight distribution system and a rough terrain processing system.The weight distribution system will automatically distribute the rider's weight between the grips and the pedals by controlling the tension of the muscles and shifting the rider’s body. This will increase the stability of the bike when cornering, increase the accuracy of holding the required angle of inclination and allow the rider to keep his balance at low and zero speeds.The rough terrain processing system will be responsible for the relaxation and tension of the muscles in order to compensate for the rapid impacts of the terrain. If slow impacts such as hitting a kicker or pumping a smooth bump can be processed directly by the player, then processing of rough and rapid impacts should fall on the shoulders of the automatic system. This will improve the stability of the bike on the tracks with many holes, roots, stones and brake bumps. Accordingly, it will be possible to add more obstacles of this kind to the tracks. In the demo version, the rough terrain is almost absent since such a terrain cannot yet be processed by the rider.GraphicsAt the current stage of the project the graphics is not the most important component, and the quantity and quality of improvements in this direction will be determined by the remaining time for the project. However, there are several things that I plan to do:1. Grass display will be enhanced. In the MTB Game Demo, each blade of grass is represented by a separate geometry, which causes a few performance and aliasing issues. It is possible instead to display grass with textured geometry blocks, and the size of the blocks will vary depending on the distance to the observer. It will solve performance and aliasing problems. Using textures of different grass types will also increase the visual diversity.2. The visual appearance of trails will be improved. In the MTB Game Demo, trails are represented by regular tiled textures, which often create noticeable repetitive patterns. To avoid this, mixing different types of textures for the center and edges of the trails, as well as textures that add additional random details, could be used.3. Forest textures will be added to represent far forests: that will improve the background quality.4. Each bike park in the game will contain its own unique set of tree types, roots, rocks and trail surfaces.5. There will be a general optimization of the rendering process, which will ensure the highest possible performance. This is especially important for the implementation of a virtual reality mode.Images below shows what graphics exists at the current moment:SoundThe sound system in the game supports all the necessary types of sounds that bike can produce. At the moment there are no sound files representing the set of sounds. In the MTB Game Demo, all the variety of sounds is represented by a few simple sounds recorded on a smartphone at home. I am going to purchase the necessary recording equipment to record high quality real bike sounds.Virtual RealityMountain bike simulator is an application where virtual reality fits perfectly. This applies both to a more complete perception of the tracks with their surface in stereo mode, and to the control that can be implemented with the help of virtual reality controllers very similar to the actual control of the bike. The diagram shows how to control a bike using VR controllers:If there are no VR controllers, the standard joystick controls can be used. The demo version of MTB Game Demo does not support virtual reality, but to get an idea of how the game will look like in this mode, video tracks in VR 180 3D format were rendered.Video fragments from the external camera (00:00-04:22 - simulator mode, 04:22-08:17 - arcade mode):Download with larger bitrateVideo fragments from the helmet camera (00:00-05:37 - simulator mode, 05:37-09:20 - arcade mode):Download with larger bitrateBasic and Stretch GoalsThis section contains the main project implementation tasks described earlier.

Some money will pay for the necessary equipment to create high-quality content. It will also help to cover the cost of software and some 3D assets that I do not have time to do myself.If the project will reach its minimum funding goal of 32000 EUR, the expenditure chart will look like this:Equipment required:
Digital camera to capture textures.
Audio recording equipment to capture sounds for the game.
A set of control devices to test and set them up within the game.
A PC or laptop with AMD CPU and GPU to test and optimize the game for this hardware.
If funding exceeds 42000 EUR, additional funds will be spent on a VR headset, VR controllers and a MacBook to debug and optimize the Mac OS version of the game.Further additional funding will allow to hire professional 3D artists to create and texture models for the game. The author's time freed in this case will be used to develop additional modes and game details described in section “Basic and Stretch Goals”.Why IndieGoGo?MTB Game project now is at the point when the first finish line is visible, but it is still not as close as I want it to be. A lot of work has been done, and more needs to be done. Careful analysis shows that I need 14 months of full time work to complete the project. Unfortunately, I cannot work on this project full time, as I need to cover my living expenses. Working 1-2 hours a day instead of desirable 8-10 slows down the process.

By Dragon Scale Design


Dragon Scale Design proudly presents VS Zombies, where players can either fight in the apocalypse as humans, or as zombies! Fast paced card game with simple mechanics to learn, but difficult to master. In the game players fight against other players and their groups of humans or zombies, stealing their loot points and taking over the city. The one with the most points and city locations takes over the city! 






* Graphics presented in these pictures may vary in the final product.
Game overview
In the game, players pick either a group of humans or group of zombies to play with, and uses the deck that each side has. The goal of the game is to gain loot points from looting the city, and killing other characters. One with the most points at the end of the game wins.
Event cards:


The game uses 5 decks: 


Events deck for locations and surprise effects 

Humans deck for human players to draw new characters
Zombies deck for zombie players to draw new characters
Items deck for human players to use
Ill Fortune for zombie players to use.

Human and Zombie cards:




Both Items and Ill Fortune decks have 3 different types of cards:

Offensive cards
Defensive cards
Effect cards.

Humans use all kinds of item cards, from offensive cards like shotgun and scissors, to defensive cards like riot shields and bar stools. Sometimes effect cards like smoke grenade might save your group. Item deck is balanced between all sorts of cards to give you some tactical 
Zombies on the other hand use cinematic effects, from zombies being Angry, On Fire, Mutated and so on. Zombie players have mostly effect cards, meaning that zombie players can make the game go awfully funky and strange, with cards like Divine Intervention, Kill of the Week, Out of Ammo and Unstoppable force.

Items and Ill Fortune cards:






You will receive in the box:

Rulebook
Quick rules sheets
25 Zombie cards
25 Human cards
50 Items cards
50 Ill Fortune cards
50 Event cards
6 Custom engraved attack/defend dice and 2 regular dice made of compressed resin.
Approximately 50 Health and 50 loot tokens.



You can download the English prototype rulebook from here. Version of the prototype will be updated during the campaign, so for now it is a text-only version.

Finnish version of the prototype rulebook is available here. Illustrated version is coming soon!






Our main goal is 11,000 euros, which goes into funding the production costs of the game. With the minimum amount funded, we can work decent hours with the game, and deliver it approximately May 2015. Delivery may vary with the production time. You will also get the game cheaper now than from retail later!

That is why we need your help to fund VS Zombies, and bring it to everyone to enjoy! We enjoy playing games, and we enjoy making games, and the best thing is to see everyone enjoy games we make.

Please note, that due to Finnish Law, we cannot receive any funds without giving anything back, so please choose a perk.

We won't have many stretch goals, because all the game parts are in it already. We won't take anything out to add it later on. But with additional funds we can invest a lot more time working with the game, and make it better for you.






All additional funds after 20,000 euros will go into making VS Zombies a better quality game, and anything more we manage to create within the timelimit will be added into the game.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We're a small team of indie developers from Brazil with four years of company specializing on game development (with three titles released on android/ios)  and with several years of expertise developing other not-that-cool-kind-of stuff behind us and the will to create the game of our dreams, here we are on our indiegogo!</span></p>

<h3>The endless world</h3>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/971515/files/20141030085113-concept_de_wondrous_monument.jpg?1414684273"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<br/><p>The world is old, the world is broken. Many gods have risen, ruled an fallen. The last era is nigh, and the remnants of what can be called a civilization now struggle to live on a immense and deadly world. Welcome to subtera.</p>
<br/><p>Subtera is a MMO/RPG game with sandbox elements that tries to diverge from the commercial, mainstream counterparts of it’s genre by creating a unique way that players interact with the world and how he sees it’s character progress inside it. The world is huge and vast, almost impenetrable, filled with new and ancient magic, old civilizations, dungeons, gods, good and evil beings and much, much more, buried deep down under the planet.</p>
<br/><p>Being hardcore gamers ourselves with years of playing baggage, we’re trying to achieve something that would make us addicted - and we think we’re on the right track!</p>
<br/><h3>Gameplay</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p>Subtera aims to be a different kind of MMO/RPG by modifying some if the core concepts seen nowadays in this genre:</p>
<br/><h4>Fast character creation and upgrading</h4>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/971686/files/20141030100006-createChar.jpg?1414688406"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<p>The player does not need to spend months farming experience or grinding on the same mob forever. By leveraging the battles on less but much more powerful and deadly enemies the player is able to upgrade it’s perks with hours or days of play-through. Imagine a world where you are able to lose everything with a single mistake but in counterpart a character is able to achieve it’s full power in less time. We want to players to be engaged on the act of playing, not the act of doing repetitive tasks. This means that there is no experience bar; you’ll improve by doing the task you like more, and in counterpart will lose the skills you don’t use so much, without countless hours of grind or macroing.</p>
<br/><h4>No economy, less npcs</h4>
<p>Well, this one is a bit ambitious but we want the game to be dynamic as it’s world. Do you want to buy a sword? Go to the forger guild and as a forger to do so! The forger does not have the required materials to forge the sword? Open a guild quest so adventurers can look for them! Found a dungeon while excavating for materials? Open a quest to let players know about it, and partner with them to (try to) clean it. Cleaned a dungeon? Call for all guilds to excavate and explore all the lore attached with all of them. The possibilities are infinite.</p>
<br/><p>Having no economy means that items will be the currency in the game, and we’re going to provide a way to know what a item is being traded for, so people won't be scammed. We’re going to provide ways to  create valuable items like coins, so if the world end’s up with a currency, it will be developed by it and not just imposed upon.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/988890/files/20141105101411-HonorableInconsequentialAmericanindianhorse.gif?1415211251"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>""Building a furnace. Differently than normal crafting games the 3D format of the blocks will determine the resulting construction""</i><br/><br/><h4>Death</h4>
<br/><p>Death is a valuable commodity on subtera.</p>
<p>In a deadly world, death is inevitable, and interacting with it has to be unique, meaning that we have implemented a system that will be both interesting to new players and engaging for hardcore players. When you create a character, you have to create a testament binding: a god, guild and some quests will enable you to opt on what will happen when you die: do you want to lose your character stats but remain with your equipment? Bind your soul to Lord Debarthas, deity of possession. Want to risk everything and try a new character with completely random stats and equipment upon dying? Bind to Clev, the god of forbidden deeds, and try your luck. Each contract will give good and bad perks to your character, creating a unique environment and giving the sense of consequence to the player. The higher the contract is, the bigger is the power up and harsh is the payment. You chose!</p>

<br/>
<br/><h4>Crafting and construction</h4>

<p>We love sandbox games, and love what you can achieve by changing the world around you and tailoring it to resemble you, truly leaving a mark on it. We’re trying to create a sandbox game that’s at the same time beautiful and engaging. So differently from common sandbox games the process of construction/destruction is a bit slower than normal to ensure that people won’t break stuff freely and we don’t want to add magic stuff to prevent people from doing it. Note that enemies will be able to destroy the environment so prepare yourself for epic raids!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/988902/files/20141105101724-LeftEvergreenGonolek.gif?1415211444"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h4>Intelligent AI</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/971679/files/20141030095906-cenario_isometrico.jpg?1414688346"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>That’s one thing that bothers most of us: it seems that for the vast part of a MMO the mobs are there… to be killed. This is hurtful to the gameplay as the only motivation is to the player is:</p>
<br/><p>A - kill thousands of enemies of X</p>
<p>B - Look for a new, stronger enemy and repeat</p>
<br/><p>We want to break this never-ending chain of boringness by greatly improving the enemy AI. Expect that mobs work together for a goal, based on it’s preferences: expand the dungeon, loot cities and guilds, protect their environment and bosses. If a enemy has a pack behaviour, ALL enemies will turn against you (and will not attack one after the other, of course).</p>
<br/><br/><h4>Non classification</h4>
<br/><p>We hate the idea of forcing a player to follow a specific path, hardening the choices as he/she progresses, so we’re removing the class system and leaving only the mastery tree: if you use a lot a set of items and do a lot of activities, you’ll be more effective on it, and thus creating your path on the way you desire. Of course improving a set of skills will set a drawback on another set of skills, so we wont have overpowered users.</p>
<br/><br/><h4>Weapons and magic</h4>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/971533/files/20141030090016-weapons_set00.png?1414684816"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<p>As everything on subtera, the creating of weapons will be customizable. We’re going to develop an interface to the crafter that will enable the ability to customize, improve, paint and create new and unique items. This will enable a class of players/creators, which will have their creations valued on the entire game, instead of countless pre-factored weapons and infinite drops. We’re also planning to create a blender plugin to effectively enable the creation of new models by players and designers, thus creating brands for each player.</p>
<br/><br/><h3>History</h3>
<br/><h4>The world</h4>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/971537/files/20141030090116-env01.jpg?1414684876"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<br/><p>Over the cycles the world had diverse names: Etreria on the far north in the peace era, Larth by the underlings after the greatest magic catastrophe, “The Minruir” by the great race of nomads, and many others only mentioned on bard tales; nowadays no one seems to bother in naming it, so scarce and depleted the civilization remnants are, being often called “The Land” for the upper parts of it and “Underland” for it’s depths.</p>
<br/><h3>Races</h3>
<br/><h4>The slaves</h4>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/971523/files/20141030085656-slave.png?1414684616"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<p>There is evidence of the human race since almost the beginning of time, and since the beginning of time their main purpose was as labor force. No matter which race was dominant, humans were there to provide them with all sorts of tasks, be on the depths of the lava mines or fighting on wars just for it’s captives amusement. Since the last cataclysm which vanished the dominant races at approximately 100 cycles before most of them are free, roaming in small nomad groups, using their ability to adapt to almost all kinds of environments, situations and having excellent forging, crafting and weapon skills.</p>
<br/><p>It’s rumored that a small gathering of humans is starting a new city  just below the surface on the far east...</p>
<br/><br/><br/><h4>Gears</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/971525/files/20141030085737-good.gears.jpg?1414684657"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>The gears - the jocose name for the tall, human shaped mechanoids built in when the great race was thriving do not define their grandioseness; built to work with magic as it’s fuel, the Heighir are strong, robust and almost unbreakable. Once bound to a master and used as war machine, they’re now free, and having an infinite magic attunement capacity on it’s own they are starting to regroup on the ruins where their masters once ruled. Their power cores are extremely valuable as a magic source, but finding one, or destroying a gear to recover one is a task indented for the most fierce and talented ones. Many of the magic adepts try to get patronized by one gear, learning everything they can on the arcane ways. Usually a gear does not engage in battle, as it’s probably the end of a large portion of the world if they do.</p>
<br/><h4>The craven</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/971527/files/20141030085821-dark.jpg?1414684701"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 901px;""/></p>
<br/><p>Little is known about the craven’s origin. Some say that they were the by product of the ungodly experiments of Ir Malzam, the most famous dark manipulator of all times; some say that they are beings expelled by the most deep parts of the world, acting like growing tumors. The fact is, the cravens are beings of pure darkness, feeding from any living being that has the misfortune of crossing their path. Usually a craven does not kill it’s prey, messing with their emotions and even altering reality to extract the most of it’s fear. Once the victim is crazy, depleted of every possible emotion the craven then kills it and “borrows” what was most frigging, effectively becoming more dreadful and strong with each victim.</p>
<br/><p>Just remember: where is darkness, there are cravens lurking on it. NEVER go outside on the dark. Ever.</p>
<br/><br/><h3>Gods / Deities</h3>
<br/><p>Little is known about exactly what is a god or a deity on this feeble world.

<br/><h4>Deity</h4>Some players, upon doing great deeds or achievements will be rewarded with a god blessing. This blessing, which will work for the character lifetime will grant a serie of bonuses and enable quests for the player and for other players that follow the god/are passing by.

</div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","About Subtera

Subtera is the ambitious fufillment of our dreams: to create a multiplayer RPG where you, the player, matters. As gamers and developers with tens of years combined and a dissatisfaction with the current gaming state, we tried to create something ambitious and interesting at the same time. 
We're a small team of indie developers from Brazil with four years of company specializing on game development (with three titles released on android/ios)  and with several years of expertise developing other not-that-cool-kind-of stuff behind us and the will to create the game of our dreams, here we are on our indiegogo!
Since we're targeting hardcore games and do want to create a great atmosphere, with real challenges, and with a deep connection with the community. We think that a crowdfunding is the best, if not the only possible way to make this come true.


The endless world




The world is old, the world is broken. Many gods have risen, ruled an fallen. The last era is nigh, and the remnants of what can be called a civilization now struggle to live on a immense and deadly world. Welcome to subtera.
Subtera is a MMO/RPG game with sandbox elements that tries to diverge from the commercial, mainstream counterparts of it’s genre by creating a unique way that players interact with the world and how he sees it’s character progress inside it. The world is huge and vast, almost impenetrable, filled with new and ancient magic, old civilizations, dungeons, gods, good and evil beings and much, much more, buried deep down under the planet.
Being hardcore gamers ourselves with years of playing baggage, we’re trying to achieve something that would make us addicted - and we think we’re on the right track!
Gameplay

Subtera aims to be a different kind of MMO/RPG by modifying some if the core concepts seen nowadays in this genre:
Fast character creation and upgrading




The player does not need to spend months farming experience or grinding on the same mob forever. By leveraging the battles on less but much more powerful and deadly enemies the player is able to upgrade it’s perks with hours or days of play-through. Imagine a world where you are able to lose everything with a single mistake but in counterpart a character is able to achieve it’s full power in less time. We want to players to be engaged on the act of playing, not the act of doing repetitive tasks. This means that there is no experience bar; you’ll improve by doing the task you like more, and in counterpart will lose the skills you don’t use so much, without countless hours of grind or macroing.
No economy, less npcs
Well, this one is a bit ambitious but we want the game to be dynamic as it’s world. Do you want to buy a sword? Go to the forger guild and as a forger to do so! The forger does not have the required materials to forge the sword? Open a guild quest so adventurers can look for them! Found a dungeon while excavating for materials? Open a quest to let players know about it, and partner with them to (try to) clean it. Cleaned a dungeon? Call for all guilds to excavate and explore all the lore attached with all of them. The possibilities are infinite.
Having no economy means that items will be the currency in the game, and we’re going to provide a way to know what a item is being traded for, so people won't be scammed. We’re going to provide ways to  create valuable items like coins, so if the world end’s up with a currency, it will be developed by it and not just imposed upon.

""Building a furnace. Differently than normal crafting games the 3D format of the blocks will determine the resulting construction""Death
Death is a valuable commodity on subtera.
In a deadly world, death is inevitable, and interacting with it has to be unique, meaning that we have implemented a system that will be both interesting to new players and engaging for hardcore players. When you create a character, you have to create a testament binding: a god, guild and some quests will enable you to opt on what will happen when you die: do you want to lose your character stats but remain with your equipment? Bind your soul to Lord Debarthas, deity of possession. Want to risk everything and try a new character with completely random stats and equipment upon dying? Bind to Clev, the god of forbidden deeds, and try your luck. Each contract will give good and bad perks to your character, creating a unique environment and giving the sense of consequence to the player. The higher the contract is, the bigger is the power up and harsh is the payment. You chose!



Crafting and construction



We love sandbox games, and love what you can achieve by changing the world around you and tailoring it to resemble you, truly leaving a mark on it. We’re trying to create a sandbox game that’s at the same time beautiful and engaging. So differently from common sandbox games the process of construction/destruction is a bit slower than normal to ensure that people won’t break stuff freely and we don’t want to add magic stuff to prevent people from doing it. Note that enemies will be able to destroy the environment so prepare yourself for epic raids!

Intelligent AI

That’s one thing that bothers most of us: it seems that for the vast part of a MMO the mobs are there… to be killed. This is hurtful to the gameplay as the only motivation is to the player is:
A - kill thousands of enemies of X
B - Look for a new, stronger enemy and repeat
We want to break this never-ending chain of boringness by greatly improving the enemy AI. Expect that mobs work together for a goal, based on it’s preferences: expand the dungeon, loot cities and guilds, protect their environment and bosses. If a enemy has a pack behaviour, ALL enemies will turn against you (and will not attack one after the other, of course).
Non classification
We hate the idea of forcing a player to follow a specific path, hardening the choices as he/she progresses, so we’re removing the class system and leaving only the mastery tree: if you use a lot a set of items and do a lot of activities, you’ll be more effective on it, and thus creating your path on the way you desire. Of course improving a set of skills will set a drawback on another set of skills, so we wont have overpowered users.
Weapons and magic




As everything on subtera, the creating of weapons will be customizable. We’re going to develop an interface to the crafter that will enable the ability to customize, improve, paint and create new and unique items. This will enable a class of players/creators, which will have their creations valued on the entire game, instead of countless pre-factored weapons and infinite drops. We’re also planning to create a blender plugin to effectively enable the creation of new models by players and designers, thus creating brands for each player.
History
The world




Over the cycles the world had diverse names: Etreria on the far north in the peace era, Larth by the underlings after the greatest magic catastrophe, “The Minruir” by the great race of nomads, and many others only mentioned on bard tales; nowadays no one seems to bother in naming it, so scarce and depleted the civilization remnants are, being often called “The Land” for the upper parts of it and “Underland” for it’s depths.
Races
The slaves




There is evidence of the human race since almost the beginning of time, and since the beginning of time their main purpose was as labor force. No matter which race was dominant, humans were there to provide them with all sorts of tasks, be on the depths of the lava mines or fighting on wars just for it’s captives amusement. Since the last cataclysm which vanished the dominant races at approximately 100 cycles before most of them are free, roaming in small nomad groups, using their ability to adapt to almost all kinds of environments, situations and having excellent forging, crafting and weapon skills.
It’s rumored that a small gathering of humans is starting a new city  just below the surface on the far east...
Gears

The gears - the jocose name for the tall, human shaped mechanoids built in when the great race was thriving do not define their grandioseness; built to work with magic as it’s fuel, the Heighir are strong, robust and almost unbreakable. Once bound to a master and used as war machine, they’re now free, and having an infinite magic attunement capacity on it’s own they are starting to regroup on the ruins where their masters once ruled. Their power cores are extremely valuable as a magic source, but finding one, or destroying a gear to recover one is a task indented for the most fierce and talented ones. Many of the magic adepts try to get patronized by one gear, learning everything they can on the arcane ways. Usually a gear does not engage in battle, as it’s probably the end of a large portion of the world if they do.
The craven

Little is known about the craven’s origin. Some say that they were the by product of the ungodly experiments of Ir Malzam, the most famous dark manipulator of all times; some say that they are beings expelled by the most deep parts of the world, acting like growing tumors. The fact is, the cravens are beings of pure darkness, feeding from any living being that has the misfortune of crossing their path. Usually a craven does not kill it’s prey, messing with their emotions and even altering reality to extract the most of it’s fear. Once the victim is crazy, depleted of every possible emotion the craven then kills it and “borrows” what was most frigging, effectively becoming more dreadful and strong with each victim.
Just remember: where is darkness, there are cravens lurking on it. NEVER go outside on the dark. Ever.
Gods / Deities
Little is known about exactly what is a god or a deity on this feeble world. Some eras the mightiest champions were fabled as deities (and some even acted as one), some races worshiped the nature and their gods were the earth and the water and the animals, and some replied them, and yet some civilizations took the nature gods and bent they under magic and corruption.
DeitySome players, upon doing great deeds or achievements will be rewarded with a god blessing. This blessing, which will work for the character lifetime will grant a serie of bonuses and enable quests for the player and for other players that follow the god/are passing by. This will increase the quest dynamism and will offer great rewards for the most challenging quests.



What  we have now



We have functional prototype with the terrain engine, network and basic features working.

Risks & Challenges

Let's be frank - a mmo costs money. A LOT of money. We struggled to define a reasonable yet non frightening goal so we could at least have the chance to create something that is worth for the backer and can evolve on something stable for us to keep on the development and continuation of the game.
The Team
Besides working on the prototype for the latest 8 months, we're toying with games/consulting for quite some time (four years and counting), and released three games for Android and iOS using in house technologies like an open-source C++ 2D game engine (based on the famous libgdx engine) which runs the same game on all platforms  (and linux too!).

<h3>About Sneaky Bruno Games<br/>
</h3>
<p>Hi everyone!  I've loved video games since my first try at Super Mario Brothers back in the glorious 80s. Since then, I've always thought that it would be a cool job to someday be involved in making video games. But one decision lead to another and as most stories go, we end up doing something different from what we once thought in doing. So one day, I told myself that I have to try and decided to start focusing on making my own games. But I didn't want just another game company that copied another company's blockbuster game. I wanted to be original and have a greater purpose. Shortly after, I founded an independent mobile game studio called ""Sneaky Bruno Games"" and decided that The Great Brain Adventure should be its first project. The Great Brain Adventure comes from a list of 8 game concepts.  I chose it simply because of the great potential that I see in its story, characters, and planned features. I truly believe that it is the perfect vehicle to begin my future as a game maker. <br/></p>
<p>So I hope that what you have seen so far has gotten you excited and inspired to help me release my first game of many that I would love to make for all to play and enjoy. Thank you all in advance!</p>
<p>What I wrote here is actually quite compressed, there is more to learn by going to our website. It is also the best place to get the latest news and updates such as videos, photos and other media. I will be updating the website as the project moves forward:<a href=""http://www.sneakybrunogames.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> www.sneakybrunogames.com</a></p>
<p>We also have a Facebook page which I will also update as often as possible:<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sneakybrunogames"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> www.facebook.com/sneakybrunogames</a></p>

About Sneaky Bruno Games

Hi everyone!  I've loved video games since my first try at Super Mario Brothers back in the glorious 80s. Since then, I've always thought that it would be a cool job to someday be involved in making video games. But one decision lead to another and as most stories go, we end up doing something different from what we once thought in doing. So one day, I told myself that I have to try and decided to start focusing on making my own games. But I didn't want just another game company that copied another company's blockbuster game. I wanted to be original and have a greater purpose. Shortly after, I founded an independent mobile game studio called ""Sneaky Bruno Games"" and decided that The Great Brain Adventure should be its first project. The Great Brain Adventure comes from a list of 8 game concepts.  I chose it simply because of the great potential that I see in its story, characters, and planned features. I truly believe that it is the perfect vehicle to begin my future as a game maker. 
So I hope that what you have seen so far has gotten you excited and inspired to help me release my first game of many that I would love to make for all to play and enjoy. Thank you all in advance!
What I wrote here is actually quite compressed, there is more to learn by going to our website. It is also the best place to get the latest news and updates such as videos, photos and other media. I will be updating the website as the project moves forward: www.sneakybrunogames.com
We also have a Facebook page which I will also update as often as possible: www.facebook.com/sneakybrunogames
We also have a Twitter account under @SneakyBrunoIf you need to contact me, here is my email:patrick.gatdula@gmail.com

The project is based on two main products: <br/></span></span></h4><h4><br/></h4><p>
</p><p>En este su segundo proyecto
Bajosocial Productions quiere, con vuestra ayuda, customizar el juego  de mesa Neuroshima Hex.</p><p>El proyecto consta de dos pilares:</p><p><br/></p><ul><li><h3><span>The Neuroshima Bases:</span></h3></li></ul><h4><span>Created with a hybrid process using the classic
hand modeling<span>  and 3D computer modeling
and printing  and made of first quality polyurethane
resin. </span></span></h4><h4><span><span>
Each of the bases will be customized for each of the official armies of the
game, with designs and chord symbols and colors for each faction. </span></span></h4><h4><span><span>
These bases are created so that you can fit the headquarters tiles of each of the
factions, giving your game more visual richness and making the differentiation of units easier,
thus improving your gaming experience. Give your headquarters the importance it
deserves! </span></span></h4><p><br/></p><p>
</p><ul><li><h4>
<span><span></span></span>Las Neuroshima Base:</h4></li></ul><p><span><span></span></span>Creadas con un proceso híbrido entre el modelado
en 3D por ordenador y el modelado a mano y realizadas en resina de poliuretano tintada
de primera calidad. </p>
<p>Cada una de las bases estará
personalizadas para cada uno de los ejércitos oficiales del juego, con diseños
acordes y con los símbolos y colores correspondientes a cada facción.</p>
<p>Estas bases están creadas para que se pueda
encajar el hexágono de cuartel general de cada una de las facciones, dándole a
tus partidas una mayor riqueza visual y facilitando la diferenciación de las
unidades, mejorando así tu experiencia de juego. Dale a tu Cuartel general la importancia que merece!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/849294/files/20140911032650-DSC_0039.JPG?1410431210"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><ul><li><h3><span>The Neuroshima bags: </span></h3></li></ul><h4><span>Velvet bags of 10 x 12.5 cm, in the colors and

With these bags you can store your armies more efficiently. All the bags being
different makes the identification much
easier when choosing army, and thanks to its locking mechanism all the pieces
can be stored without risk of loss. <br/>
The<span>  Neuroshima Bags also offer, due to their proper size, the
possibility of drawing your tiles straight

sus facciones de una manera más eficiente. Al ser todas diferentes será mucho
más fácil su identificación a la hora de elegir facción y gracias a su
mecanismo de cierre todas las fichas podrán ser guardadas sin riesgo de pérdidas.</p>

corresponding bags in each color. <br/>

<span>Now only 9 bases remain to have the 14 official game
armies. <br/>
This first limit for the product is low, and leaves no profit margin for me, this
has a reason; Bajosocial Productions is not a “normal” company, it is created
by a fan of the games, and as a fan of the game the most important thing is to produce
it, and share them with other players
around the world. </span><br/>

</span></p><p>Faltarian las 9 restantes para llegar al
total de los 14 ejercitos oficiales del juego</p>
<p>Este primer límite para realizar los
productos es bajo, y no deja margen de ganancia por mi parte, esto tiene una
razón; Bajosocial Productions no es una empresa al uso, ha sido creada por un
fan de los juegos de mesa, y como fan del juego que soy lo importante en
primera estancia es llegar a producirlo y poder 
así compartir estos complementos con otros jugadores alrededor del

of Michal Oracz. 
Choose an army and upgrade your game experience in this harsh post-apocalyptic
world with Neuroshima Base and Bajosocial Productions. 
Bases y bolsa customizadas para el juego Neuroshima Hex de Michal Oracz.
Elije un ejército y mejora tu experiencia de juego en este
duro mundo postapocalíptico gracias a Neuroshima Base y Bajosocial Productions.


1- 
WHAT DO I
OFFER? 
     QUE ES LO QUE OFREZCO?
In this second project, Bajosocial Productions
wants, with your help, customize the Neuroshima Hex board game. 
The project is based on two main products: 
En este su segundo proyecto
Bajosocial Productions quiere, con vuestra ayuda, customizar el juego  de mesa Neuroshima Hex.El proyecto consta de dos pilares:The Neuroshima Bases:Created with a hybrid process using the classic
hand modeling  and 3D computer modeling
and printing  and made of first quality polyurethane
resin. 
Each of the bases will be customized for each of the official armies of the
game, with designs and chord symbols and colors for each faction. 
These bases are created so that you can fit the headquarters tiles of each of the
factions, giving your game more visual richness and making the differentiation of units easier,
thus improving your gaming experience. Give your headquarters the importance it
deserves! 

Las Neuroshima Base:Creadas con un proceso híbrido entre el modelado
en 3D por ordenador y el modelado a mano y realizadas en resina de poliuretano tintada
de primera calidad. 
Cada una de las bases estará
personalizadas para cada uno de los ejércitos oficiales del juego, con diseños
acordes y con los símbolos y colores correspondientes a cada facción.
Estas bases están creadas para que se pueda
encajar el hexágono de cuartel general de cada una de las facciones, dándole a
tus partidas una mayor riqueza visual y facilitando la diferenciación de las
unidades, mejorando así tu experiencia de juego. Dale a tu Cuartel general la importancia que merece!The Neuroshima bags: Velvet bags of 10 x 12.5 cm, in the colors and
with the printed symbols of each of the armies of the game. 
With these bags you can store your armies more efficiently. All the bags being
different makes the identification much
easier when choosing army, and thanks to its locking mechanism all the pieces
can be stored without risk of loss. 
The  Neuroshima Bags also offer, due to their proper size, the
possibility of drawing your tiles straight
from the bag in each of your turns.Las
Neuroshima bags: 
Bolsas de terciopelo de 10 x 12.5 cm, de los
colores y con los símbolos impresos de cada uno de los ejércitos del juego.
Con estas bolsas el jugador podrá almacenar
sus facciones de una manera más eficiente. Al ser todas diferentes será mucho
más fácil su identificación a la hora de elegir facción y gracias a su
mecanismo de cierre todas las fichas podrán ser guardadas sin riesgo de pérdidas.
Las Neuroshima Bags ofrecen también, debido a
su adecuado tamaño, la posibilidad de ser el lugar donde descansen nuestros
hexágonos, pudiendo robarlos cada turno directamente de la bolsa
2-  WHAT ARE THE PACKS?      CUALES SON LOS PACKS?
There are 5 packs alvailable:Estos son los cinco packs disponibles:

3- 
WHAT DO I NEED?      QUE ES LO QUE NECESITO?
The goal I propose to raise is 1000€ (x backers
+ or -) 
This is a low total that marks the limit I need to finish the remaining model bases
and tokens, purchase the needed products (resins, silicones, dyes ...) and the
corresponding bags in each color. 
In this moment I have made ​​the 5 bases of basic box: La meta que propongo recaudar para que el
proyecto se realice son 1000€ ( x backers + o - )
Esta es una cifra baja que marca el límite
que necesito para poder acabar los modelos de las bases restantes y los
contadores,  adquirir los productos (
Resinas, siliconas, tintes…) y las bolsas correspondientes en cada color.
Hasta este momento estan realizadas las 5 bases de la caja
básica:

Now only 9 bases remain to have the 14 official game
armies. 
This first limit for the product is low, and leaves no profit margin for me, this
has a reason; Bajosocial Productions is not a “normal” company, it is created
by a fan of the games, and as a fan of the game the most important thing is to produce
it, and share them with other players
around the world. 


Faltarian las 9 restantes para llegar al
total de los 14 ejercitos oficiales del juego
Este primer límite para realizar los
productos es bajo, y no deja margen de ganancia por mi parte, esto tiene una
razón; Bajosocial Productions no es una empresa al uso, ha sido creada por un
fan de los juegos de mesa, y como fan del juego que soy lo importante en
primera estancia es llegar a producirlo y poder 
así compartir estos complementos con otros jugadores alrededor del
mundo.* The Dancer army will have 3 bases.* La faccion The Dancer tendra 3 bases.
4-  IS THIS ALL?      ES ESTO TODO?
No, that´s not all... or at least I hope so. 
Reaching the 1000€ target would already be a great pleasure for me, but to be able to make the most complete
possible project, I seek your
cooperation to make together something as large as possible. 
And for that I propose different stretch goals
No, no es todo… o al menos eso espero.
Llegar a los 1000€ seria para mí una gran
alegría, pero en mi meta de realizar el proyecto más completo posible busco
vuestra colaboración para hacer de esto, entre todos, algo lo más grande
posible.

<p>Toda la escenografía es creada a mano, utilizando siempre materiales que representen la realidad lo mejor posible. La superficie del tablero es de escayola de alta resistencia a la compresión. Casi 500kg/cm2, aproximadamente 16 veces superior a la resistencia de la escayola convencional y con un mejor acabado para obtener el mayor nivel de detalle posible.  Además hemos añadido una capa de aglomerado para dar rigidez al conjunto y otra capa de poliexpan de alta densidad para poder dar volumen y conseguir diferentes niveles en el tablero. <br/></p>

INICIO/HOME


Vamos al grano! 
Necesitamos ayuda para comercializar un proyecto consistente en un
tablero de juego modular a escala 28/30mm. El tablero de juego es ideal para
crear el ambiente perfecto en tus juegos de escaramuzas, partidas de rol o simplemente
construir un diorama.
My apologies for my bad English. Getting down to business! We require
investors to help us market our project, consisting
of a modular board game,
28/30mm scale. The board game is
ideal for creating the perfect environment in your skirmish games, role playing
or just build a diorama.
El concepto de este tablero de juego modular consiste en:
módulos rectangulares  independientes de
16” por 16” pulgadas (40,6 x40,6cm) que pueden unirse entre si a modo de puzzle
encajando perfectamente  en cualquier
posición que desees, creando en conjunto la superficie de una ciudad, aldea o
pueblo medieval, dando el ambiente perfecto para una partida de rol o un juego
de escaramuzas tipo Mordheim, 1650 A capa y espada, Carnevale , Malifaux…
o incluso para una batalla de cualquier wargame tipo Warhammer, Warthrone of
Saga, Warlord, Kings of War, etc 
The
concept of this modular board game
comprises: of separate rectangular
modules 16"" by 16"" inches (40,6 x 40.6cm). The boards
can fit together like a puzzle,
fitting perfectly in any desired position, creating an area of a city, town or medieval village, providing the perfect setting
for a role or skirmish game as Mordheim , 1650 a capa y espada, Carnevale,
Malifaux ... or even for a battle of any war game such as Warhammer, Warthrone of Saga, Warlord, Kings of War, etc.



SOBRE NOSOTROS/ ABOUT US


El principal responsable del proyecto es Víctor,
ingeniero de treinta y tantos años, aficionado desde hace muchos años a los
wargames y  juegos de rol, al que le
encanta pintar miniaturas y crear elementos de escenografía.  
The
project leader, Victor, is an
engineer in his
thirties and a
fan for many years of war games and RPGs,
who loves painting miniatures and creating elements
of scenery.
Miniature Battlegrounds es una pequeña empresa con grandes
aspiraciones y se ha lanzado de cabeza a crear escenografía espectacular y
barata para nuestros juegos. “Creemos que nuestro producto es interesante
y  va a gustar, por eso ya hemos empezado
a trabajar en la fabricación de los módulos del tablero y ese es el motivo de
que la cantidad económica solicitada no sea muy elevada. Con esta campaña de
financiación en masa pretendemos recaudar algunos fondos para los duros inicios
y sobre todo ver la aceptación del producto entre los aficionados.”
MiniatureBattlegrounds is
a small company with big aspirations and has
already started creatinga series of spectacular sceneriesat affordable prices. ""We believe that our product will be of interest, so we have already started production of the modules for the board and that is the reason, the
request for financial investment is not very high. With Crowdfunding Campaign we hope to raise enough
funds for the tough beginnings and especially to see the product accepted among fans. ""

¿POR QUÉ RECURRIR A UNA CAMPAÑA DE CROWDFUNDING? / WHY USE A CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN?


Creemos que este método de financiación es ideal para
nosotros. Pretendemos darnos a conocer entre los aficionados de todo el mundo y
además solicitar vuestra ayuda para poder financiarnos durante los primeros
meses de trabajo. Confiamos en que el proyecto guste a los jugadores y por eso
ya hemos empezado a fabricar la mayoría de los módulos del tablero invirtiendo
nuestros propios ahorros.
We
believe this method of financing is ideal for us. We aim to be known to our fans around the world and also request your help to fund us for the
first months work. Confident that the players willlike the project
and so we have begun to make the majority of the board modules investing our
own savings.



EL TABLERO / THE BOARD


Vayamos a lo que realmente nos interesa. Let's get down to
what really interests us.







Toda la escenografía es creada a mano, utilizando siempre materiales que representen la realidad lo mejor posible. La superficie del tablero es de escayola de alta resistencia a la compresión. Casi 500kg/cm2, aproximadamente 16 veces superior a la resistencia de la escayola convencional y con un mejor acabado para obtener el mayor nivel de detalle posible.  Además hemos añadido una capa de aglomerado para dar rigidez al conjunto y otra capa de poliexpan de alta densidad para poder dar volumen y conseguir diferentes niveles en el tablero. 
All
the scenery is created by hand, using materials that represent reality at it’s
best. The material chosen for the board surface is plaster. But not just any
ordinary plaster, after our research we have chosen high compressive strength plaster as it is
tougher and provides a
better finish for the highest level of detail possible. Almost 500kg/cm2, about 16 times the strength of conventional plaster.


Primer módulo original /First original module

Como podéis ver en las imágenes, los típicos edificios de
las colecciones de escenografía de cualquier jugador encajan perfectamente
sobre el tablero y el resultado que se obtiene es espectacular. Para mostraros
el resultado, se han utilizado elementos de escenografía de las marcas Tabletop
World, Games Workshop y edificios creados con los moldes Hirst Arts Fantasy
Architecture Inc. Si el proyecto sale adelante, ya estamos pensando en la
creación de nuestra propia gama de edificios.
As
you can see from the pictures, the typical buildings and scenery collections of any player fit perfectly onto the board and the result you get is
spectacular. To show the result, we used elements of scenery brandslike Tabletop World, Games Workshop and buildings created with moulds from Hirst Arts Fantasy Architecture Inc. If the project goes ahead, we are
thinking about creating our own range of buildings.



Estas son las imágenes del prototipo del tablero. These are the images of the prototype board.
El diseño definitivo se ha mejorado, se han adaptado las
medidas de los módulos a las dimensiones estándar de las mesas de juego y se ha
rediseñado completamente la superficie del tablero. 
The
final design has been improved and adapted the module
size to the standard dimensions of the gaming tables, and completely redesigned
the board surface.


Módulo Básico / Basic Module

Primer módulo original /First original module
Nota: Para el diseño definitivo No se han utilizado

Note:
For the final design we have
NOT used moulds or pieces designed
by other brands.
Durante el último año he realizado la dura labor de jugar
montones de partidas junto a mi equipo de playtester y el resultado ha sido
genial. Hemos jugado un mínimo de una partida semanal y no hemos llegado a
jugar dos partidas iguales gracias a las inmensas posibilidades que ofrece el
tablero modular. Además el tablero ha resistido perfectamente el maltrato de
los jugadores más entusiastas  y no ha
sufrido graves desperfectos en todo este tiempo de uso.
During
the last year I have tested the boardby playing
lots of games with my team of playtester and the results have been great. We have played at least a game every week
and we have not played two games the same thanks to the immense potential of the
modular board. In addition, the board has stood up
to the mistreatment of enthusiastic players and is still in excellent condition after all oftheusage it has had.

It supplements the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. By participating in Erevos, you enter a community of users that is responsible in all ways for the evolution of the world. Although Erevos community might be large, only a finite number of players will have a GROWING character. Players that control them have special privileges, the most important of which is that they get to promote their character’s story by uncovering a plot written especially for their character. From the moment he creates a growing character, a player is in direct contact with us to lead this story wherever he likes. He does not follow predetermined, linear plotlines as he would in most generic adventures. This epic tale is told in rhapsodies. Rhapsodies are short adventures written by professional Pathfinder adventure authors (the team includes among others <b>Ron Lundeen</b>, freelance author for Paizo Publishing and designer and publisher behind Run Amok Games - to view Ron's Pathfinder writing credits click <a href=""http://www.runamokgames.com/related-works.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>, <b>Sean Holland</b>, freelance adventure author - click <a href=""http://seaofstarsrpg.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to visit Sean's blog or <a href=""http://www.tychesgames.com/WriterResume.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to view his complete resume that includes his writing credits) especially for a minimum of 4 specific characters. They are tailored to players’ needs as well as characters’ backgrounds, roleplaying motivations and anything else that might be important to each player as indicated by him. Every rhapsody we give out is 100% unique, designed only for a specific adventuring party and each subsequent one is designed having in mind the feedback that the players provided us upon the previous rhapsody’s completion. We are designing rhapsodies based on your character’s choices as well as your preferences as a player, while we try to build a plot worth discovering for your character. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Players with growing characters are thus in complete control of the action in the world, as all major events are the results of their adventuring as played in rhapsodies and described by their direct feedback. There are no NPCs handled by the creators to determine and run major events. All important decisions regarding the setting are decided through either direct characters’ actions or the community (ie custom players’ creations such as religions or orders that have the approval of the community or major random events decided via established polls etc). Even though the setting provides world lore with a rich background that will be uncovered gradually through rhapsodies and world lore entries in the official website (world lore also includes several distinctive traits i.e. most elves live in the desert and most dwarves around mountain peaks), it will all depend on the community's approval and in time it might evolve into an entirely different world (although its history will remain the same). Although the exact number of players that will have growing characters will be finalized during product development, a good rough first estimation might be around 1,000 characters that will be selected on a 1st come – 1st served basis. Right now, all pledge levels of $60 or more GUARANTEE a growing character. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Erevos is not only about character advancement through adventuring though. It is also an environment of political influence, intrigue and power. Characters can build their own cities, participate in local or regional councils (:called Conclaves of Authority) and increase in power and authority to rule kingdoms or even create their own ones. It is a world where anyone might plot against your character or be your character’s most faithful ally, as everyone you interact with is a player character! All players will have a personal online page where they can update the evolution of their character, thus becoming part of Erevos’ history. We will be going through your feedback and select the most important events of your character’s adventuring career to update the world’s history regularly. Erevos' history will be online, available for everyone to see and will include all important accomplishments any character might have made thus granting him reputation which will also have in-game benefits. The world will be growing along with your characters and its evolution will depend on players’ choices. You may stop the infamous villain of the Shimmering Spine, enter the oldest dragon’s lair all kingdoms have ever seen, explore the mostly feared negative energy lands beneath the Souls River or travel beyond the Sea of Hope. It’s your choice. Whatever you choose though, Erevos’ history will have your character’s name carved on it. </p><p>Read on or visit our <a href=""http://erevos.info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website </a>to find out more or our <a href=""http://erevos.forumatic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">forum </a>to ask us a direct question!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/501485/files/20140411130606-Theogonia.jpg?1397246766"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Theogonia city map by Herwin Wielink</span><br/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/430456/files/20140313042420-The_Sun_s_Tear.jpg?1394709860"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The Sun's Tear island by Juan Carlos Barquet<br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/430457/files/20140313042456-WHY_EREVOS.jpg?1394709896"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/></p><p></p><p>There are three main reasons why you should subscribe to Erevos.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Firstly, Erevos will give you the chance to play adventures, designed by professionals ONLY for you and the rest of your party. Every adventure created in Erevos is only sold once, to one adventuring party and it is tailored to meet the players’ needs, according to their guidelines and feedback. By subscribing to Erevos, you have the opportunity of having a team of professional, successful adventure authors write adventures solely for you, based on your character’s background, role playing motivations and anything else you feel is important. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Secondly, Erevos is a truly living world, in the sense that all important events in the evolution of the world are dictated by the players. By subscribing, you become part of the community and can affect the world directly: there are no important NPCs taking action, there are no random events so significant that your character must only sit back and watch. You are the one making these big decisions along with the rest of the subscribers, in several ways: You can give your character an administrative position (such as in the local Conclave of Authority or by creating your own kingdom) and discuss in our forums (or decide by yourself in the case of your own kingdom) the politics of the region you represent; you can bring in the world your own custom creations (such as religions, orders etc) that become official if the community approves them; you can vote in our established polls that determine minor random events (this option is available to all registered users of Erevos even if they have not subscribed); finally you can take the initiative to lead your character’s story (through the feedback you will be giving us before receiving your adventures) towards a dangerous task of great significance for the world. Erevos is yours to shape however you see fit. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thirdly, Erevos is a dynamic environment that evolves along with your character’s accomplished feats. By subscribing, you gain access to a personal online profile page for your character. This page will be yours to update as often as you like with anything that relates to your character (adventures description, journal entries, important events in a character’s life etc). Everyone will be able to view your profile page. We will be following all characters, selecting the most significant events in their adventuring careers to update the world’s history regularly. Your character’s most significant feats of strength will be recorded for everyone to know. In Erevos, every action a character takes has consequences. Every adventure has consequences. Killing a mighty villain or a band of raiders means no more trouble for many other adventuring parties. Aiding the villain on the other hand will make their lives tougher. Choosing between ensuring the safety of your followers and going on a suicide mission to save your daughter will affect many other characters’ lives and might even determine the world’s future. And this decision will be recorded for the rest of the world to know. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/430796/files/20140313080539-Erevos_world_map.png?1394723139"" src="""" style=""""/></p>EREVOS world map by Anne Mohr (Schattenherz)<br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/430798/files/20140313080623-Nessima_Desert.jpg?1394723183"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Nessima Desert by Juan Carlos Barquet<br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/430800/files/20140313080749-PLAY_IN.jpg?1394723269"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">So, you want to know how this might work in practice? Here are the steps you will take if you want to participate fully in Erevos: </p><p>1.	User Registration </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">By registering, you enter the online community of Erevos which means you gain access to several benefits (which are free of charge) among which having a say as to how the world will evolve! </p><p>2.	Characters Creation </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">You can create some characters, based on the Pathfinder roleplaying game rules for character creation. This can include background, role playing motivations, mannerisms and anything else you feel is important to highlight your character. Each character will have his own online profile page, where you can upload the evolution of his adventures. Other users will be able to view your page and leave comments, which will make your character’s page interactive. </p><p>3.	Character Subscription </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">By subscribing, you can make one of your characters become ‘growing’ and start advancing in levels. An additional character can turn ‘growing’ for every additional subscription you get. The character advances at predetermined intervals (1 level per 3 weeks). You can change your ‘growing’ character at any time although this might affect slightly your gameplay. Subscriptions will be open until the maximum number of Player Characters is reached (the cap has not been finalized yet, nevertheless a good, rough first estimation might be around 1,000 - all pledge levels of $50 or more GUARANTEE for now a growing character). </p><p>4.	Adventuring Party Formation </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">After you subscribe, you get to choose your adventuring party. This might be an online party that uses an online communication platform or our forums (or any other forum that you like), or it could be a live party playing wherever and whenever you feel like it. Adventuring parties should have at least 4 playing characters and a Game Master. The Game Master does not have to be a subscriber in Erevos (although he might). By all means, joining an adventuring party does not mean you will have to spend all your gaming sessions in it (although you could, if you wanted to), just like an adventurer would not have to travel with a group of people he did not get along with if he did not want to. There will always be other adventuring parties that you can join. These will be most likely online though, unless it happens that there are other Erevos subscribers in your neighborhood. </p><p> 5.	Adventuring Party info upload </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">After your party is complete, we receive all info that relates to it. This includes character backgrounds, adventuring career goals, role playing motivations, players’ preferences and anything else you feel appropriate. You may also create an online page of your party where you can describe explicitly all of the party’s future adventures. </p><p>6.	Rhapsodies Delivery </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Based on the info you have provided, we create short adventures called 'Rhapsodies' especially for your adventuring party. Rhapsodies are tailored to meet your preferences and include story elements that can help you uncover a sub-plot for your character, apart from the main plot that relates to the whole party. We will try to provide at least 1 such rhapsody per month to each adventuring party for free (this is part of your subscription), although the exact number of rhapsody deliveries will depend on the results of b-playtest. Each rhapsody is designed to advance your character about one and a half level. You can purchase additional rhapsodies at our online shop. Although these extra rhapsodies can move your character’s and adventuring party’s stories forward, they do not allow however your character to advance in levels at a higher pace in the official world (all characters advance at the predetermined pace regardless of the number of rhapsodies they have completed). </p><p>7.	Feedback </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Upon rhapsody completion, you provide us with feedback on the results of your gaming sessions, any important decision the party (or a specific character) made, major events that occurred and anything else you think is important. Apart from this feedback, you can upload any piece of info you like (as detailed as you want to) to your character’s or adventuring party’s online profile page. If you want to see an example of steps 5, 6 and 7 (adventuring parties info, rhapsodies written for specific characters and feedback after the session), click <a href=""http://erevos.info/?p=119"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p><p>8.	Erevos official history update </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We collect feedback from all playing adventuring parties and update Erevos world history respectively. New rhapsodies are designed having this information in mind. Every single action you take might affect the adventures of hundred of other players. After a while, we will have gathered enough info to publish a book on the evolution of the world. This campaign guide will be the official Erevos history and it will be full of references to all players that participated and accomplished major or minor tasks in it! </p><p>Visit our <a href=""http://erevos.info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://erevos.info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> to find out more or our <a href=""http://erevos.forumatic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">forum</a> to ask us a direct question!</p><p>You can find us in <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ErevosLCS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/erevoscs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a> too!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/430805/files/20140313081031-Bonecrest.jpg?1394723431"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Bonecrest city by Juan Carlos Barquet<br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/430812/files/20140313081113-Theogonia.jpg?1394723473"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Theogonia city by Juan Carlos Barquet<br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/430813/files/20140313081137-WHAT_IS_UR_MONEY.jpg?1394723497"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">At the minimum funding level, you will essentially be funding the development of Erevos campaign setting and its first couple of months of operation.

We believe so much in the revolutionary approach of Erevos and want so eagerly to see it launching that we are willing to work on its development without any payment and providing all running costs ourselves if we reach only our minimum funding goal. We have decided that we will use Indiegogo funds to cover running costs only if we exceed significantly the minimum funding goal. In that case, extra funds will be distributed partially between extra features and running costs (:see Stretch Goals for more info on extra features).

Being dedicated role playing gamers for almost 20 years, we have followed a large variety of role playing options to settle down to the concept of Erevos. We have tried different settings, but kept coming back to medieval fantasy; we have tried different system rules, but there was always something missing when compared to d20 system; we have tried playing with other role playing groups and adding other people to our group (in fact although 7 people are the core of our group, more than 30 have played at least 1 campaign with us during these years and they have all contributed, each in a distinctive way, to the conclusive result thus we can not thank them enough), but always missed the awesome, all-night long sessions that we had with our closest friends when we were teenagers. As we were growing towards our 30s, we already knew clearly our likes and dislikes: the d20 system had improved the game a lot, as it offered a very detailed base of rules to solve most difficult situations that would appear in a gaming session, but also had expanded the role playing market significantly and this offered a huge variety of options regarding adventures, feats, spells etc. There were so many resources! On the other hand, we felt all these rulebooks had taken something away from the game. Before the d20 system, every adventure had a unique feeling. The feeling was not unique anymore. After long hours of talks among us, thoughts on the subject and participation in forum discussions, we concluded that it was the lack of improvisation that had taken away this feeling of uniqueness. At first, we considered creating a new rules system from scratch, which would leave a lot of room for improvisation. This plan was very quickly abandoned. We were so used to running through the rulebooks when we had a conflict as to how a matter should be resolved that we were practically addicted to it. This process had officially become part of the fun. And then we decided to direct the GM towards personalizing the written adventure we had bought to meet our characters’ goals and our needs as players! The results were better than expected. The feeling was back on! Every character had a goal that the others did not know about, or a secret mission he had to accomplish as a sub-plot. I am pretty sure several players have more or less attempted this and know what I am talking about. We were finishing campaigns in totally unpredictable for the adventure author ways. And then we faced another problem. The campaign setting we were used to playing, which we had grown to love deeply, was evolving by its creators and it seriously contradicted the stories we had played. We felt we had given so much energy and creativity into creating great characters and stories and then in one moment the campaign setting directors were taking it all away (well, obviously we could not really blame a setting creator that he did not consult us before evolving the story). Being in our early 30s some years later, we were still anticipating the day when a campaign setting creator would say: “My world is yours, players! Mess with it as you like.” This is how Erevos came into life. We decided that we have waited for too long. We wanted to have a campaign setting that has rich world lore (in fact, Erevos is the result of a decade of role playing action of our role playing group – many, many adventures brought together and as such it has great background depth which we plan on revealing gradually through adventures and major plotlines but which will still rely on the community’s approval), but also the highest possible degree of players’ involvement. We wanted to offer personalized adventures (‘Rhapsodies’), but better and richer than the ones we had played: designed directly by professional adventure authors. We wanted to keep the great structure d20 adventures have, but bring sandbox game elements to them (which is why we design your next rhapsody, after you provide us with feedback on the last one you played). We strongly believe Erevos is the next step towards a living, interactive world that offers creative players infinite options. It is what role playing games should be all about. Before we conclude, we would like to thank everyone that contributed to bringing our passion to life, but mainly: Tassos ‘Saras’ Kallianiotis, Panayotis ‘Billaras’ Karalis, Aristidis ‘Arukos’ Kiriakidis, Yannis ‘Kikias’ Kikiantonis and Stavros ‘Dallas’ Dalakas.</p><h1>US</h1><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Although many people have contributed in distinctive ways to complete Erevos planning and Indiegogo campaign launch, there are two people who have put endless hours and disturbed consistently their wives by not being able to focus on anything else than Erevos the last few months: Yannis -johstas- Psychogiopoulos and Nikos -madnick- Mantasas.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yannis finished his studies in finance in 2004 and got a job at a consultancy. A few years later (2008), he completed his MSc in Management at London School of Economics and immediately got back to his previous employment. Ever since then though, he dreamed of the day when he would run a project he most passionately cared about. When the consultancy he worked for decided to let all employees go due to the Greek economic crisis a few months ago, Yannis saw an opportunity rather than a threat: He decided to develop Erevos. As a role-playing gamer, Yannis is very fond of complex characters and rich stories, ever since 1997 when he was first introduced to rpgs. He mostly likes role-playing situations that provide his characters with significant conflict of values. If you would like to talk to Yannis directly, visit his <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/giannis.psychogiopoulos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">profile page in Facebook</a> and send him a private message.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Nikos studied engineering in Guildford (UK) and has changed a couple of jobs during the last ten years, that included a Store Manager position at the Greek multinational Germanos, an Account Manager position at a company distributing systems and services for geographical tracking and a Recycling Inspector for TuV Austria Hellas. He started playing rpgs consistently at high school (1995). He is a passionate collector of old-school rpg books, is a rules-lawyer and likes action-packed adventures (both in rpgs and movies). If you would like to talk to Nikos directly, visit his <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/nick.mantasas?fref=browse_search"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">profile page in Facebook</a> and send him a private message.</p><h1></h1><h1>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h1><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our main concern from day 1 was whether we would be able to provide with personalized service to every player that gets involved. We aim to have personal contact with every player, get to know his likes and dislikes. Given the relatively small size our company, we feel we do not have the resources to guarantee the top quality service we aim to offer to a very large amount of players. This is why we decided to offer growing characters (which is the core of our personalized service) to a limited number of players.

As Erevos IndieGoGo
campaign is about to end, we want to thank all those of you who contributed, or
supported it any other way!
We did not reach our
funding goal, but nevertheless still intend to develop Erevos, although at a somewhat
slower rate and with a couple of tweaks. Before we reveal our contingency plans
though, we want to hear your comments, as well as get some feedback to fix some
parts that might have not been very well received. So, within the next few
days, we will be sending a questionnaire to all of you whose email address we
have access to (this includes all IndieGoGo contributors, Erevos forum
registered members and all other people who have received emails or PMs from us
in other platforms – if you are not in any of these lists and want to share
your feedback, contact us at erevoscs@gmail.com).
As soon as we get your feedback, we will post updates regarding the next stage
in the development of Erevos
Thanks again for all
the support!

Erevos co-creatorEREVOS IN 60'' (TL:DR)• Erevos offers the opportunity to play
‘Rhapsodies’: short personalized
adventures written by professional adventure authors specifically for 1
adventuring party, tailored to the needs of the players (theme preferences,
characters backgrounds and goals, players likes and dislikes etc)!• Erevos is a truly living campaign setting, in the sense that the world evolves according to players' will and actions. There are no significant NPCs making decisions or major random events dictating the future!• Erevos leaves great room for creativity: by registering in the community, you can upload your custom creations (orders, faiths and so on) and see them become official if the community approves them!• Erevos is a world of political influence: you can determine some part of the world's history by participating in local political councils or even create a kingdom of your own!• Erevos acknowledges your character's accomplished tasks: every registered character has a personal online profile page where he can upload his adventures and socialize, much like a social networking platform. The most significant events are recorded in the Online History Timeline becoming
part of Erevos official history!• All in all, Erevos aims to provide a free, dynamic setting to everyone interested in running a home game
and a high quality personalized service
to all subscribers by maintaining personal contact and tailoring the gaming
experience to each player’s needs. Personalized service is offered to players
with ‘Growing’ characters who have several privileges compared to regular
ones among which:
          - Receiving
Rhapsodies through their subscription
          - Participation
in Conclaves of Authority, regional councils that                                   determine local politics (through Erevos forum)
          - Access to
Kingdom-making (design in all aspects of their settlement                  which may grow into a
metropolis)
         Erevos is a living world in a medieval fantasy setting with many sandbox game elements. It supplements the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. By participating in Erevos, you enter a community of users that is responsible in all ways for the evolution of the world. Although Erevos community might be large, only a finite number of players will have a GROWING character. Players that control them have special privileges, the most important of which is that they get to promote their character’s story by uncovering a plot written especially for their character. From the moment he creates a growing character, a player is in direct contact with us to lead this story wherever he likes. He does not follow predetermined, linear plotlines as he would in most generic adventures. This epic tale is told in rhapsodies. Rhapsodies are short adventures written by professional Pathfinder adventure authors (the team includes among others Ron Lundeen, freelance author for Paizo Publishing and designer and publisher behind Run Amok Games - to view Ron's Pathfinder writing credits click here, Sean Holland, freelance adventure author - click here to visit Sean's blog or here to view his complete resume that includes his writing credits) especially for a minimum of 4 specific characters. They are tailored to players’ needs as well as characters’ backgrounds, roleplaying motivations and anything else that might be important to each player as indicated by him. Every rhapsody we give out is 100% unique, designed only for a specific adventuring party and each subsequent one is designed having in mind the feedback that the players provided us upon the previous rhapsody’s completion. We are designing rhapsodies based on your character’s choices as well as your preferences as a player, while we try to build a plot worth discovering for your character. Players with growing characters are thus in complete control of the action in the world, as all major events are the results of their adventuring as played in rhapsodies and described by their direct feedback. There are no NPCs handled by the creators to determine and run major events. All important decisions regarding the setting are decided through either direct characters’ actions or the community (ie custom players’ creations such as religions or orders that have the approval of the community or major random events decided via established polls etc). Even though the setting provides world lore with a rich background that will be uncovered gradually through rhapsodies and world lore entries in the official website (world lore also includes several distinctive traits i.e. most elves live in the desert and most dwarves around mountain peaks), it will all depend on the community's approval and in time it might evolve into an entirely different world (although its history will remain the same). Although the exact number of players that will have growing characters will be finalized during product development, a good rough first estimation might be around 1,000 characters that will be selected on a 1st come – 1st served basis. Right now, all pledge levels of $60 or more GUARANTEE a growing character. Erevos is not only about character advancement through adventuring though. It is also an environment of political influence, intrigue and power. Characters can build their own cities, participate in local or regional councils (:called Conclaves of Authority) and increase in power and authority to rule kingdoms or even create their own ones. It is a world where anyone might plot against your character or be your character’s most faithful ally, as everyone you interact with is a player character! All players will have a personal online page where they can update the evolution of their character, thus becoming part of Erevos’ history. We will be going through your feedback and select the most important events of your character’s adventuring career to update the world’s history regularly. Erevos' history will be online, available for everyone to see and will include all important accomplishments any character might have made thus granting him reputation which will also have in-game benefits. The world will be growing along with your characters and its evolution will depend on players’ choices. You may stop the infamous villain of the Shimmering Spine, enter the oldest dragon’s lair all kingdoms have ever seen, explore the mostly feared negative energy lands beneath the Souls River or travel beyond the Sea of Hope. It’s your choice. Whatever you choose though, Erevos’ history will have your character’s name carved on it. Read on or visit our website to find out more or our forum to ask us a direct question!Theogonia city map by Herwin WielinkThe Sun's Tear island by Juan Carlos BarquetThere are three main reasons why you should subscribe to Erevos.Firstly, Erevos will give you the chance to play adventures, designed by professionals ONLY for you and the rest of your party. Every adventure created in Erevos is only sold once, to one adventuring party and it is tailored to meet the players’ needs, according to their guidelines and feedback. By subscribing to Erevos, you have the opportunity of having a team of professional, successful adventure authors write adventures solely for you, based on your character’s background, role playing motivations and anything else you feel is important. Secondly, Erevos is a truly living world, in the sense that all important events in the evolution of the world are dictated by the players. By subscribing, you become part of the community and can affect the world directly: there are no important NPCs taking action, there are no random events so significant that your character must only sit back and watch. You are the one making these big decisions along with the rest of the subscribers, in several ways: You can give your character an administrative position (such as in the local Conclave of Authority or by creating your own kingdom) and discuss in our forums (or decide by yourself in the case of your own kingdom) the politics of the region you represent; you can bring in the world your own custom creations (such as religions, orders etc) that become official if the community approves them; you can vote in our established polls that determine minor random events (this option is available to all registered users of Erevos even if they have not subscribed); finally you can take the initiative to lead your character’s story (through the feedback you will be giving us before receiving your adventures) towards a dangerous task of great significance for the world. Erevos is yours to shape however you see fit. Thirdly, Erevos is a dynamic environment that evolves along with your character’s accomplished feats. By subscribing, you gain access to a personal online profile page for your character. This page will be yours to update as often as you like with anything that relates to your character (adventures description, journal entries, important events in a character’s life etc). Everyone will be able to view your profile page. We will be following all characters, selecting the most significant events in their adventuring careers to update the world’s history regularly. Your character’s most significant feats of strength will be recorded for everyone to know. In Erevos, every action a character takes has consequences. Every adventure has consequences. Killing a mighty villain or a band of raiders means no more trouble for many other adventuring parties. Aiding the villain on the other hand will make their lives tougher. Choosing between ensuring the safety of your followers and going on a suicide mission to save your daughter will affect many other characters’ lives and might even determine the world’s future. And this decision will be recorded for the rest of the world to know. EREVOS world map by Anne Mohr (Schattenherz)Nessima Desert by Juan Carlos BarquetSo, you want to know how this might work in practice? Here are the steps you will take if you want to participate fully in Erevos: 1.	User Registration By registering, you enter the online community of Erevos which means you gain access to several benefits (which are free of charge) among which having a say as to how the world will evolve! 2.	Characters Creation You can create some characters, based on the Pathfinder roleplaying game rules for character creation. This can include background, role playing motivations, mannerisms and anything else you feel is important to highlight your character. Each character will have his own online profile page, where you can upload the evolution of his adventures. Other users will be able to view your page and leave comments, which will make your character’s page interactive. 3.	Character Subscription By subscribing, you can make one of your characters become ‘growing’ and start advancing in levels. An additional character can turn ‘growing’ for every additional subscription you get. The character advances at predetermined intervals (1 level per 3 weeks). You can change your ‘growing’ character at any time although this might affect slightly your gameplay. Subscriptions will be open until the maximum number of Player Characters is reached (the cap has not been finalized yet, nevertheless a good, rough first estimation might be around 1,000 - all pledge levels of $50 or more GUARANTEE for now a growing character). 4.	Adventuring Party Formation After you subscribe, you get to choose your adventuring party. This might be an online party that uses an online communication platform or our forums (or any other forum that you like), or it could be a live party playing wherever and whenever you feel like it. Adventuring parties should have at least 4 playing characters and a Game Master. The Game Master does not have to be a subscriber in Erevos (although he might). By all means, joining an adventuring party does not mean you will have to spend all your gaming sessions in it (although you could, if you wanted to), just like an adventurer would not have to travel with a group of people he did not get along with if he did not want to. There will always be other adventuring parties that you can join. These will be most likely online though, unless it happens that there are other Erevos subscribers in your neighborhood.  5.	Adventuring Party info upload After your party is complete, we receive all info that relates to it. This includes character backgrounds, adventuring career goals, role playing motivations, players’ preferences and anything else you feel appropriate. You may also create an online page of your party where you can describe explicitly all of the party’s future adventures. 6.	Rhapsodies Delivery Based on the info you have provided, we create short adventures called 'Rhapsodies' especially for your adventuring party. Rhapsodies are tailored to meet your preferences and include story elements that can help you uncover a sub-plot for your character, apart from the main plot that relates to the whole party. We will try to provide at least 1 such rhapsody per month to each adventuring party for free (this is part of your subscription), although the exact number of rhapsody deliveries will depend on the results of b-playtest. Each rhapsody is designed to advance your character about one and a half level. You can purchase additional rhapsodies at our online shop. Although these extra rhapsodies can move your character’s and adventuring party’s stories forward, they do not allow however your character to advance in levels at a higher pace in the official world (all characters advance at the predetermined pace regardless of the number of rhapsodies they have completed). 7.	Feedback Upon rhapsody completion, you provide us with feedback on the results of your gaming sessions, any important decision the party (or a specific character) made, major events that occurred and anything else you think is important. Apart from this feedback, you can upload any piece of info you like (as detailed as you want to) to your character’s or adventuring party’s online profile page. If you want to see an example of steps 5, 6 and 7 (adventuring parties info, rhapsodies written for specific characters and feedback after the session), click here.8.	Erevos official history update We collect feedback from all playing adventuring parties and update Erevos world history respectively. New rhapsodies are designed having this information in mind. Every single action you take might affect the adventures of hundred of other players. After a while, we will have gathered enough info to publish a book on the evolution of the world. This campaign guide will be the official Erevos history and it will be full of references to all players that participated and accomplished major or minor tasks in it! Visit our website to find out more or our forum to ask us a direct question!You can find us in Facebook and Twitter too!Bonecrest city by Juan Carlos BarquetTheogonia city by Juan Carlos BarquetAt the minimum funding level, you will essentially be funding the development of Erevos campaign setting and its first couple of months of operation. This includes the web site where all world lore material will be freely available and which will offer personal profile pages for every user (similar to social networking websites), the writing and editing of the world lore, a few maps and illustrators that will accompany it, b-playtest and the first couple of months of adventure writing after product launch. We believe so much in the revolutionary approach of Erevos and want so eagerly to see it launching that we are willing to work on its development without any payment and providing all running costs ourselves if we reach only our minimum funding goal. We have decided that we will use Indiegogo funds to cover running costs only if we exceed significantly the minimum funding goal. In that case, extra funds will be distributed partially between extra features and running costs (:see Stretch Goals for more info on extra features). The following chart shows explicitly what your money is going towards at the minimum funding level.We also wanted to make sure that all those of you who share our vision and want to see Erevos happen, are rewarded. This is why we set all pledge levels that offer a subscription at a discounted rate compared to the one after the setting is developed. The subscriptions for Erevos after development is completed will be $25 for a 1-month period, $60 for a 3-month period and $200 for a 13-month period*. Check out our backers rewards for more information on subscriptions and discounts!*b-playtest results might affect these figures slightly.$75,000The first extra feature we will develop if we overcome our minimum funding goal will be a dress-up application that will be available for everyone through Erevos website. All common races and most weapons and armors will be available so that every user will be able to view and customize his character.$85,000If we reach this level, we will make sure every area in Erevos has a regional map. Cities and other settlements developed by players during product development (:see high end pledge level rewards) will be included in these maps.$95,000At this level, we will install an extra feature in Erevos website that will allow 3-dimensional movement among historical events (fully zoomed out, all Erevos history will be shown with most significant historic events, but the more the user zooms in, the more it will focus on smaller periods of history and less significant events which might include players' involvement).$105,000At this level, we will invest more in the artwork department. More illustrations for important geographical sites, more weapons and armors for the dress-up application etc.+$10 Contribute a fantasy name of your own favored characters - settlements or anything else you like. This will be given to a setting character or locale within the next year+$20 Contribute an NPC to the setting. You provide with all details (name, race, class, personality etc) and we find a suitable spot for him!+$60 Black & White Character sketch in action stance (see an example here)+$60 Black & White Character sketch (cartoon style - see an example here)+$100 Full Color comic strip on your character  (see an example here)+$120 Full Color Character illustration in action stance+$200 Full Color Landscape illustration (average quality - see an example here)+$400 Full Color Landscape Illustration (high quality - see an example here)THE PROJECTErevos began as a way for our role playing group to add story elements to published adventures. Being dedicated role playing gamers for almost 20 years, we have followed a large variety of role playing options to settle down to the concept of Erevos. We have tried different settings, but kept coming back to medieval fantasy; we have tried different system rules, but there was always something missing when compared to d20 system; we have tried playing with other role playing groups and adding other people to our group (in fact although 7 people are the core of our group, more than 30 have played at least 1 campaign with us during these years and they have all contributed, each in a distinctive way, to the conclusive result thus we can not thank them enough), but always missed the awesome, all-night long sessions that we had with our closest friends when we were teenagers. As we were growing towards our 30s, we already knew clearly our likes and dislikes: the d20 system had improved the game a lot, as it offered a very detailed base of rules to solve most difficult situations that would appear in a gaming session, but also had expanded the role playing market significantly and this offered a huge variety of options regarding adventures, feats, spells etc. There were so many resources! On the other hand, we felt all these rulebooks had taken something away from the game. Before the d20 system, every adventure had a unique feeling. The feeling was not unique anymore. After long hours of talks among us, thoughts on the subject and participation in forum discussions, we concluded that it was the lack of improvisation that had taken away this feeling of uniqueness. At first, we considered creating a new rules system from scratch, which would leave a lot of room for improvisation. This plan was very quickly abandoned. We were so used to running through the rulebooks when we had a conflict as to how a matter should be resolved that we were practically addicted to it. This process had officially become part of the fun. And then we decided to direct the GM towards personalizing the written adventure we had bought to meet our characters’ goals and our needs as players! The results were better than expected. The feeling was back on! Every character had a goal that the others did not know about, or a secret mission he had to accomplish as a sub-plot. I am pretty sure several players have more or less attempted this and know what I am talking about. We were finishing campaigns in totally unpredictable for the adventure author ways. And then we faced another problem. The campaign setting we were used to playing, which we had grown to love deeply, was evolving by its creators and it seriously contradicted the stories we had played. We felt we had given so much energy and creativity into creating great characters and stories and then in one moment the campaign setting directors were taking it all away (well, obviously we could not really blame a setting creator that he did not consult us before evolving the story). Being in our early 30s some years later, we were still anticipating the day when a campaign setting creator would say: “My world is yours, players! Mess with it as you like.” This is how Erevos came into life. We decided that we have waited for too long. We wanted to have a campaign setting that has rich world lore (in fact, Erevos is the result of a decade of role playing action of our role playing group – many, many adventures brought together and as such it has great background depth which we plan on revealing gradually through adventures and major plotlines but which will still rely on the community’s approval), but also the highest possible degree of players’ involvement. We wanted to offer personalized adventures (‘Rhapsodies’), but better and richer than the ones we had played: designed directly by professional adventure authors. We wanted to keep the great structure d20 adventures have, but bring sandbox game elements to them (which is why we design your next rhapsody, after you provide us with feedback on the last one you played). We strongly believe Erevos is the next step towards a living, interactive world that offers creative players infinite options. It is what role playing games should be all about. Before we conclude, we would like to thank everyone that contributed to bringing our passion to life, but mainly: Tassos ‘Saras’ Kallianiotis, Panayotis ‘Billaras’ Karalis, Aristidis ‘Arukos’ Kiriakidis, Yannis ‘Kikias’ Kikiantonis and Stavros ‘Dallas’ Dalakas.USAlthough many people have contributed in distinctive ways to complete Erevos planning and Indiegogo campaign launch, there are two people who have put endless hours and disturbed consistently their wives by not being able to focus on anything else than Erevos the last few months: Yannis -johstas- Psychogiopoulos and Nikos -madnick- Mantasas.Yannis finished his studies in finance in 2004 and got a job at a consultancy. A few years later (2008), he completed his MSc in Management at London School of Economics and immediately got back to his previous employment. Ever since then though, he dreamed of the day when he would run a project he most passionately cared about. When the consultancy he worked for decided to let all employees go due to the Greek economic crisis a few months ago, Yannis saw an opportunity rather than a threat: He decided to develop Erevos. As a role-playing gamer, Yannis is very fond of complex characters and rich stories, ever since 1997 when he was first introduced to rpgs. He mostly likes role-playing situations that provide his characters with significant conflict of values. If you would like to talk to Yannis directly, visit his profile page in Facebook and send him a private message.Nikos studied engineering in Guildford (UK) and has changed a couple of jobs during the last ten years, that included a Store Manager position at the Greek multinational Germanos, an Account Manager position at a company distributing systems and services for geographical tracking and a Recycling Inspector for TuV Austria Hellas. He started playing rpgs consistently at high school (1995). He is a passionate collector of old-school rpg books, is a rules-lawyer and likes action-packed adventures (both in rpgs and movies). If you would like to talk to Nikos directly, visit his profile page in Facebook and send him a private message.RISKS & CHALLENGESOur main concern from day 1 was whether we would be able to provide with personalized service to every player that gets involved. We aim to have personal contact with every player, get to know his likes and dislikes. Given the relatively small size our company, we feel we do not have the resources to guarantee the top quality service we aim to offer to a very large amount of players. This is why we decided to offer growing characters (which is the core of our personalized service) to a limited number of players. The exact number has not been determined yet and will depend on several factors among which demand, the results of the b-playtest and generally how product development goes etc, but a good first estimation might be around 1,000. Apart from that, in order to give sandbox elements to the game, we decided to get feedback from the players after each rhapsody they complete and design their next rhapsody based on this feedback. We fear this might be very tough to handle without proper regulation. We therefore plan on setting up feedback template forms that will facilitate conclusions reaching but also allow space for personal comments.Another issue is the cost of writing an adventure (even a short one in a compact form - to view an example of play including a sample rhapsody click here) at a player by player level. To address this, we estimated the total adventure authors costs for a large volume of rhapsodies and decided it was not financially feasible to have them write for less than 4 people. This is why we decided that a minimum of 4 growing characters are required to form an adventuring party. Last but not least, to guarantee the highest product quality possible, we have already made preliminary agreements with several professionals well known at a global level within their area of expertise (adventure authors, fantasy writers, illustrators, map designer etc) and plan to contact many more!THE ARTISTSWe are in constant search to add highly skilled artists in our artistic team. The team so far includes:• Mr Herwin Wielink (:Theogonia city map - you can see a gallery of Herwin's previous works at his personal web site, some samples include Draconspire Tharstelding world map, Ankhor Deeps dungeon map etc), • Miss Anne Mohr (:Erevos world map - you can see a gallery of Anne's previous works at her deviantArt profile page, some samples include Alvarania map, Demera city map etc), • Mr Juan Carlos Barquet (:Sun's Tear illustration, but also Theogonia, Bonecrest and Nessima desert illustrations - you can see a gallery of Juan Carlos' previous works at his deviantArt profile page, some samples include the Winter Cottage illustration, the Sect etc) and• the Greeks George Melissaropoulos (Erevos art-director and cartoons expert), Kostas Foutsidis (:Lukom, Rolland and Zess sketches but also battles sketches) and Fotis Aradas.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>Imagine
 you have a few time and that are few players (less than ten) and you 
choose the way ""There can be only one"" ... In the end only rest three players: Charles, Sean and you. You shuffle the cards and deal one some each player. Charles receives a king who quickly discovers and laughs triumphantly !! Sean receives a dragon and uses his power to make you discard the 
queen you have and instead you rob another card, which is ... 
another king !!  Take it out and see how the face of Sean when  losing his dragon against your two kings is a poem, as it is removed from the game!! Now, only Charles and you in the game, you have two lives and Charles have one. Charles deal and gives you ... a monk !! You kept that, because you know no mather what card have Charles, the 
power of the monk makes your card to the same level as his card, so you

<p><b>The game
is very fast and easy to learn, and so much fun to play</b>. A card is dealt
face-down to each player, beginning with the player on the right, and the deck
of cards is placed to the right of the dealer. Once a card is dealt face-down
to each player, the player on the right of the dealer starts playing. Each
player during his/her turn may opt to take any of the following three actions:</p>
<p>1. Keep the
dealt card and forego turn (known as stand).</p>
<p>2. Use the
power of the card if it is allowed. Show the card and apply the power. </p>
<p>3. Exchange
cards with the player on the right. If the player changing the card is the
dealer, instead of exchanging it with the player on the right show the card,
tell your intention to change it, cut the deck of cards and the card that comes
up is your new card.</p>
<p>Once all
players have gone through their turns all the cards are turn face-up. Following
the playing order the card with powers meant to be use in the final round are
played. </p>
<p>Once all
the powers of the cards are enforced, the player or the players having the cards
with the lowest value lose and take one token each. Death always loses if it is
in play. The round ends once the tokens are hand out.</p>

Hi, dear
backers!!!
Imagine
 you have a few time and that are few players (less than ten) and you 
choose the way ""There can be only one"" ... In the end only rest three players: Charles, Sean and you. You shuffle the cards and deal one some each player. Charles receives a king who quickly discovers and laughs triumphantly !! Sean receives a dragon and uses his power to make you discard the 
queen you have and instead you rob another card, which is ... 
another king !!  Take it out and see how the face of Sean when  losing his dragon against your two kings is a poem, as it is removed from the game!! Now, only Charles and you in the game, you have two lives and Charles have one. Charles deal and gives you ... a monk !! You kept that, because you know no mather what card have Charles, the 
power of the monk makes your card to the same level as his card, so you 
will have the same level and in case of tie lose all ... imagine the 
face of Charles when you take your card !!  This is the idea of Death Over The Kingdom: easy and fast game that at one point can play up to 20 people.

Colonies End has been a project we have been working on for quite a while now, Initially a concept brought up 2 years ago, We have recently in the last couple of months brought the idea alive into a playable demo for you all to get a preview of what Colonies End will have to offer. Getting a playable demo out before the full game's release was very important to us here at Raw Orange Studios. We want to be able to form a community behind the game to allow people to give direct feedback and new ideas to add to Colonies End. We believe a game that is based around what fans and players want is a direction which is perfect for Colonies End. We hope you enjoy Colonies End and what it will become with your helpful support and look forward to hearing what you think.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575243155/isvppq2eggdtqhz4pmvs.png"" src=""""/></h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">Colonies End is an exciting indie game with a new take on the open-world sandbox genre exploring your way through dimensions in a sci-fi space setting! We are happy to announce our Indiegogo campaign and that with your support we can take this game from the demo/preview it is now into a truly exciting open world sandbox experience. We already have a playable demo to download but with a successful campaign Colonies End will offer:</p><ul style=""margin-left:80px;"">
<li>Space-age combat with jetpacks, bounce pads, lasers and more!</li>
<li>Explore a strange world comprised of six-dimensional realms.</li>
<li>Build exciting spaceships and space colonies with 6 tech tiers.</li>
<li>Uncover the mysteries of the Desecrators and the lost expedition! </li>
<li>Scavenge for resources to stay alive in the world’s unforgiving dimensions. </li>
<li>Find creatures ranging from the common pig to the uncommon alien trader. With creatures also ranging from close ally to deadly foe. </li>
</ul><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/uFHI1BDCa8g?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575243746/mqujan4gm1e3qhmhfhtf.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The building is primarily the core feature of Colonies End, it allows players to use gathered resources to craft a multitude of blocks which can later be used to create wacky spaceship or bases. To give Colonies End more progression, there are 6 distinct tech tiers, each making blocks more powerful and durable. For example, each tier of turret offers a more powerful projectile shot, causing more damage to enemy vessels or bases. </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">One thing to note is that with higher-tech tiers, they require more power, meaning you need your structures to contain enough reactors to power your entire vessels.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s5.gifyu.com/images/CraftingBlockSmall.gif"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575243760/rrtnahamey9pqjla1bao.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Exploring is a crucial part of Colonies End, as you progress to higher-tech tiers, each tier of blocks requires unique resources only found in one type of dimension. In the later releases of the game, you will find that each dimension offers a unique set of NPCs and interactions for the player. For example, one planned dimension is ""Aqua"" this replaces the vacuum of space for liquid, causing all sorts of hassle for the player to move around. The ""Aqua"" dimension also offers alienated aquatic creatures such as huge oversized luminous jellyfish, whales and plant-based lifeforms.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s5.gifyu.com/images/FlyBySmall.gif"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575243769/yzokrx2ksktvaqopgzqu.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">We want Colonies End to be a true space game and that means both ship and ground battles! Already in the game's demo you will be able to see a preview of this such as how the ship combat has customization due to being linked with the building aspect of the game. We will be further expanding on this if we have a successful Indiegogo campaign. This will include the turret types and projectiles varying in both visuals and strength depending on which of the six tech tiers it is from, players will also be able to use a combination of tech tier blocks and so will NPC ships too! In battle ship turret types vary in there projectiles too between lasers and torpedoes, these are controlled both manually or automatic depending on the player's choice. Ground combat is exciting too with enemies being able to get close to attack a player or use a ranged attack depending on the enemy, we want to expand upon this with different player attacks as well as a melee attack option.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s5.gifyu.com/images/shipbattleSmall.gif"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575243466/hu7xarcxxqqv0hyb7myf.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Please feel free to click the link to our Steam page below to download the game's demo.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/1132540/Colonies_End/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1132540/Colonies_End/</a></p><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qsa-3wDdyZ8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575244994/afy40gkue2rtdslu1w1r.png"" src=""""/></h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">Already we have made great progress with us at a point of releasing the first playable demo of Colonies End and launching this Indiegogo campaign ?! We have all of the core features of the game already and this can be seen in the playable demo, these features will be refined and expanded as well as additional features if successful, below are some images of other assets for the game which aren't in the demo but will in some form make their way into full release.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575263394/muth3mzchzmu9ghxeadw.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">So you know where this project is up to, now we want to tell you our plan and how your support can help make this an awesome game! With a successful Indiegogo campaign we are going to be aiming to improve, enhance and bug fix the game in a large variety of ways, the key areas are:</p><ul style=""margin-left:120px;"">
<li>Completion of five remaining dimensions and enhancing current.</li>
<li>A non-intrusive story set across the six dimensions!</li>
<li>More functionality to craftable blocks.</li>
<li>Side missions for players also adding in trading.</li>
<li>New sound system for the game featuring ambient soundtrack.</li>
<li>Overhaul of the NPC system such as a wider range of Desecrator enemies.</li>
<li>Modding support for custom blocks.</li>
<li>Overhaul of combat system such as traps, bounce pads, etc.</li>
<li>Full implementation of survival mechanics.</li>

Colonies End has been a project we have been working on for quite a while now, Initially a concept brought up 2 years ago, We have recently in the last couple of months brought the idea alive into a playable demo for you all to get a preview of what Colonies End will have to offer. Getting a playable demo out before the full game's release was very important to us here at Raw Orange Studios. We want to be able to form a community behind the game to allow people to give direct feedback and new ideas to add to Colonies End. We believe a game that is based around what fans and players want is a direction which is perfect for Colonies End. We hope you enjoy Colonies End and what it will become with your helpful support and look forward to hearing what you think.Colonies End is an exciting indie game with a new take on the open-world sandbox genre exploring your way through dimensions in a sci-fi space setting! We are happy to announce our Indiegogo campaign and that with your support we can take this game from the demo/preview it is now into a truly exciting open world sandbox experience. We already have a playable demo to download but with a successful campaign Colonies End will offer:
Space-age combat with jetpacks, bounce pads, lasers and more!
Explore a strange world comprised of six-dimensional realms.
Build exciting spaceships and space colonies with 6 tech tiers.
Uncover the mysteries of the Desecrators and the lost expedition! 
Scavenge for resources to stay alive in the world’s unforgiving dimensions. 
Find creatures ranging from the common pig to the uncommon alien trader. With creatures also ranging from close ally to deadly foe. 
 The building is primarily the core feature of Colonies End, it allows players to use gathered resources to craft a multitude of blocks which can later be used to create wacky spaceship or bases. To give Colonies End more progression, there are 6 distinct tech tiers, each making blocks more powerful and durable. For example, each tier of turret offers a more powerful projectile shot, causing more damage to enemy vessels or bases. One thing to note is that with higher-tech tiers, they require more power, meaning you need your structures to contain enough reactors to power your entire vessels. Exploring is a crucial part of Colonies End, as you progress to higher-tech tiers, each tier of blocks requires unique resources only found in one type of dimension. In the later releases of the game, you will find that each dimension offers a unique set of NPCs and interactions for the player. For example, one planned dimension is ""Aqua"" this replaces the vacuum of space for liquid, causing all sorts of hassle for the player to move around. The ""Aqua"" dimension also offers alienated aquatic creatures such as huge oversized luminous jellyfish, whales and plant-based lifeforms. We want Colonies End to be a true space game and that means both ship and ground battles! Already in the game's demo you will be able to see a preview of this such as how the ship combat has customization due to being linked with the building aspect of the game. We will be further expanding on this if we have a successful Indiegogo campaign. This will include the turret types and projectiles varying in both visuals and strength depending on which of the six tech tiers it is from, players will also be able to use a combination of tech tier blocks and so will NPC ships too! In battle ship turret types vary in there projectiles too between lasers and torpedoes, these are controlled both manually or automatic depending on the player's choice. Ground combat is exciting too with enemies being able to get close to attack a player or use a ranged attack depending on the enemy, we want to expand upon this with different player attacks as well as a melee attack option. Please feel free to click the link to our Steam page below to download the game's demo.https://store.steampowered.com/app/1132540/Colonies_End/   Already we have made great progress with us at a point of releasing the first playable demo of Colonies End and launching this Indiegogo campaign ?! We have all of the core features of the game already and this can be seen in the playable demo, these features will be refined and expanded as well as additional features if successful, below are some images of other assets for the game which aren't in the demo but will in some form make their way into full release.So you know where this project is up to, now we want to tell you our plan and how your support can help make this an awesome game! With a successful Indiegogo campaign we are going to be aiming to improve, enhance and bug fix the game in a large variety of ways, the key areas are:
Completion of five remaining dimensions and enhancing current.
A non-intrusive story set across the six dimensions!
More functionality to craftable blocks.
Side missions for players also adding in trading.
New sound system for the game featuring ambient soundtrack.
Overhaul of the NPC system such as a wider range of Desecrator enemies.
Modding support for custom blocks.
Overhaul of combat system such as traps, bounce pads, etc.
Full implementation of survival mechanics.
Flight or fight system (encouraging different play styles from players).
Expansion of player ship vs AI game mode!
