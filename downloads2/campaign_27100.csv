</p><div> <h3>Making a dream come true</h3>
<p>After barely escaping the Rwandan genocide in 1994 where a million 
people were killed in 100 days, Anselme and Therese had two things – a 
deep faith in God and a dream to emigrate to a country where they could 
safely live again.</p>
<p>After living as stateless citizens in Kenya for 20 years, their 
prayers were answered when they emigrated with their three children to 
Canada. </p>
<p>They need help now to finish making the dream come true. </p>
<p>Imagine hiding in a tree, watching helplessly as your family is 
literally butchered by a crowd of machete waving fanatics. Not far away,
 your future wife was running through the woods as roving marauders were
 shooting anybody they could see. A million people were killed in 100 
days during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. </p>
<p>Eventually, Anselme Nkurunziza and Therese Mukamugema met up in 
Kenya, where for 20 years, they lived as stateless persons. They 
married, had three children, found a way to attend and finish college, 
and mostly dreamt of emigrating to Canada. </p>
<p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Join our Indiegogo effort to help them get started in their new home 
just outside Montreal. Equipped with strong faith and determination to 
create a good life for their children, they left Kenya with a suitcase 
apiece, and no money. They need what every family needs as they start a 
new life: basic appliances, furniture, household goods, clothes for 
school in the fall, and hopefully, enough for a down payment on a 
vehicle. </p>
<p>Since getting to Canada in April, they’ve survived on the goodwill of
 another refugee who earlier had made it to Canada. Anselme had to 
borrow money so they could get on the plane to Montreal. </p>
<p>Because Anselme arrived very sick and had to spend two weeks in a 
hospital getting treated for a months-old severe inner ear infection, he
 hasn’t been able to begin working. He owes more than $5,500 for the special
 antibiotics that he has been taking after leaving hospital. (Hospital 
care is free in Canada, but the drugs needed afterwards are not.) <br/></p>
<p>Because their host's home is very crowded, Anselme and Therese have been forced to live apart. Their son lives with Anselme; the daughters are with Therese. This is not a good way to start the school year. <br/></p> <p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Margaret Mead said: <i>Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, 
committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing 
that ever has.</i></p>
<p>There are countless organizations that you can contribute to. 
</p>
<p>There are times when we find ourselves in over our heads. We get 
behind on bills, plans don't quite work out, we lose a job. Most of us 
have some security net or community to fall back on.</p>
<p>Extending your resources to help Anselme and family provide that community support they need to start a new life.</p>
<p>For the past few years, they have been able to survive with the help 
of a few friends in the United States. Now that those resources are 
dwindling, we are asking for your support to help them start anew. Your donation of $25, 50, $100, or more will help reunited them and get them started on their new lives. <br/></p>
<p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We know that not everyone has the financial resources to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p> <ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. Share the link on social media and with your friends.</li>

<p><b>IMPACT</b></p>
<p>According to a 2012 study by the Pew
Research Center, 59% of seniors in the United States reported that they “go
online,” and 47% indicated that they have a high-speed broadband connection at
home. That figure may be higher now, but a large segment of seniors still remain
unconnected. These non-users are generally older and less affluent than the
seniors who have access to online platforms and often have significant
challenges with health or disability issues. They are largely disconnected from
valuable digital tools and services, both physically and psychologically, and
are not taking advantage of online news and information, government services, health

<h3>""What the heck is Dynamizer™?""</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496164854/ocd7wpo9z8llt6fupjqk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Hi there! We are Marvin, Michelle, and Josh — the creators of Dynamizer™.</p>
<p>For years, we've worked with adults in organizations of all sizes, helping them learn to discover and develop their strengths. As you might imagine, this approach completely transforms workplaces!</p>
<p>But as we kept doing this work, we realized we weren't starting EARLY enough.</p>
<p><strong>We thought: what would happen if YOUNG PEOPLE could learn about their strengths much, <i>much</i> earlier in their lives?</strong></p>
<p><i>Here's a few things to ponder...</i></p>
<ul>
<li>What would happen if young people knew which activities made them feel <strong><i>dynamic and energized</i></strong> <u>before</u> they started looking for a career?</li>
<li>What would happen if young people could be more <i><strong>comfortable and confident</strong></i> being themselves?</li>
<li>What would happen if young people knew how to <i><strong>appreciate and celebrate the differences</strong></i> of the other young people around them?</li>
</ul>
<p>(You can see the possibilities now, right?? Yeah, we do, too.)</p>
<p><i>The. World. Would. Be. Changed.</i></p>
<p>Thus, Dynamizer™ was born!</p>
<p>We started testing it out in a number of different environments, including perhaps most notably as a foundational element of <i>Camp Rise Above</i> (see Erin's testimonial below!). The initial results were SO off-the-charts encouraging, we decided to move it into production.</p>
<h3><i><strong>NOW WE NEED YOUR HELP!</strong></i></h3>
<p>//</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497754337/ovgccu6ylfzukyzb6a6r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div><h3>""What are strengths?""</h3></div>
<p>We define strengths as things that energize us, make us feel strong, and come very naturally. And this next part is super important: <strong><i>Dynamizer doesn’t just focus on things young people are “good at” or can ""do well,""</i> but also on the things that will truly <i><u>energize their best life</u></i>,</strong> and help them find their most engaging career someday! This is NOT just a ""career assessment,"" but a new, innovative way to identify a young person's true inner strengths and help them focus on the things that will energize them most throughout their whole lives! </p>
<h3>""Does it work??""</h3>
<p>Great question! Short answer: <u><strong>YES</strong></u>. But you don't have to take our word for it; here are a few quotes from people who have used Dynamizer™ out in the real world:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>""Our campers get so much from using Dynamizer! </strong>Living with serious illnesses and disabilities often causes these children to feel defined by their weaknesses. However, Dynamizer allows them to identify their individual strengths and talents. As they step away from being labeled by their illness, these wonderful children have the opportunity to overcome obstacles and grow in their capabilities. The focus of Dynamizer on individual strengths builds confidence and changes the way children perceive themselves for years to come.""</i> — Erin Marie Ulmer, Executive Director, Camp Rise Above</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>""I have witnessed first-hand how Dynamizer provides an opportunity for young people to understand their own unique strengths and the strengths of others,</strong> helping them accept and respect differences as being positive and wonderful.""</i> — Gene D’Agostino, Board of Directors, Oceanside Collegiate Academy</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""As an executive coach and consultant, I find great value in identifying, understanding and leveraging one’s strengths. Dynamizer accomplishes this with young people in such a way that they can gain strategies early to live and thrive with a continuing picture of the best version of themselves. This has profound immediate and long-term implications for greater productivity, stronger relationships and effective direction. <strong>I strongly recommend Dynamizer for each and every child in your life.</strong>""</i> — John Carroll, Author, The Great Big Book Of Goal Setting And Getting</p>
<div><div><h3>""What's the difference between a 'deck' and a 'box?'""</h3></div></div>
<div><p>A single deck is perfect for a dynamic discussion with 1 young person (or even 2 if you pair them up to share a deck!). The Dynamizer™ box contains 15 full decks, so it's perfect for groups up to 30 young people!</p></div>

<h3>""What can I do with it?""</h3>
<p>Share the power of energizing strengths with a young person in your life, and help...</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Grow a young person's <u>Self-Awareness</u></strong> — Dynamizer™ boosts self-awareness and self-esteem by providing deep personal insights about intrinsic motivators</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improve a young person's <u>Relationships</u></strong> — Dynamizer™ improves communications and relationships by helping young people understand where other people are coming from</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build a young person's <u>Self-Confidence</u></strong> — Dynamizer™ helps young people stand up to negative peer pressure by building self-confidence and resilience</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Address <u>Conflict &amp; Bullying</u></strong><strong> between young people </strong>— Dynamizer™ teaches how to constructively address interpersonal conflicts and helps prevent bullying by respecting differences</p></li>

</div><div>
<h3>""Sounds great! What do you need me to do?""</h3>
<p><strong>It's pretty simple — we need funding to pay for the first-run production of Dynamizer™!</strong></p>
<p>This project is a labor-of-love side-project for the three of us. We know it needs to exist, and we need your help to turn it into a real, tangible thing.</p>
<p>We're raising $19,500 to start — this will get us 1000 of the 15-pack Dynamizer boxes you see in the photos. This multi-pack will allow a teacher or youth leader to use just one box and teach 15-30 kids at a time about their strengths!</p>
<p>As you can imagine, there have been quite a few ""out of pocket"" expenses that the three of us have been self-funding just to get this thing going (product design, initial manufacturer costs, website design, game testing, legal fees, bank fees, etc.). Some of the $19,500 will pay us founders back for our initial investment, and the rest will go right back into creating more Dynamizer™ products to serve more kids!</p>

<h3>""Why would I want to help with this?""</h3>
<p><i>*Cue ""We Are The World, We Are The Children..."" music*</i></p>
<p>If even a little part of you believes that our children really are our future, we hope you'll donate and share.

<p>Short answer: no. We've already committed to this first order — they'll actually be arriving on the U.S. soil quite soon! </p>

<h3>""Is donating money the only way I can help?""</h3>
<p>Of course, we'd really appreciate a donation, even if it's $5 — a donation from everyone who sees this would likely exceed our goal! So please consider forgoing your weekly latte and helping a young person learn about their strengths.</p>
<p>That said, if you just can't donate, we understand!</p>
<p><strong>In that case, please share this webpage with your network</strong> — you can share it with your <strong>local church youth pastor</strong>, someone who <strong>volunteers with the youth group</strong>, an <strong>instructor working with after school programs</strong>, a <strong>teacher or administrator at the school</strong> your kids attend, someone you know <strong>who works with Boys &amp; Girls Clubs</strong>, <strong>Girl Scouts / Boy Scouts</strong>, or <strong>anyone else you know who cares about or works with young people ages 11+</strong>.</p>

<h3>""What's next??""</h3>
<p>We see Dynamizer™ as a <i>movement</i>, not a product, and we hope you'll join us on our mission to bring strengths to young people everywhere! After this product gets launched, we have a LOT more ideas for how to help young people utilize their strengths better and more powerfully in the world around them.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of this project is to help make sure your kids (and everyone else's kids) end up in a career they love. And before then, a young person knowing their strengths will help them interact better with their classmates, stand up to peer pressure, and even help prevent bullying. </p>

We thought: what would happen if YOUNG PEOPLE could learn about their strengths much, much earlier in their lives?
Here's a few things to ponder...

What would happen if young people knew which activities made them feel dynamic and energized before they started looking for a career?
What would happen if young people could be more comfortable and confident being themselves?
What would happen if young people knew how to appreciate and celebrate the differences of the other young people around them?

(You can see the possibilities now, right?? Yeah, we do, too.)
The. World. Would. Be. Changed.
Thus, Dynamizer™ was born!
We started testing it out in a number of different environments, including perhaps most notably as a foundational element of Camp Rise Above (see Erin's testimonial below!). The initial results were SO off-the-charts encouraging, we decided to move it into production.
NOW WE NEED YOUR HELP!
//

""What are strengths?""
We define strengths as things that energize us, make us feel strong, and come very naturally. And this next part is super important: Dynamizer doesn’t just focus on things young people are “good at” or can ""do well,"" but also on the things that will truly energize their best life, and help them find their most engaging career someday! This is NOT just a ""career assessment,"" but a new, innovative way to identify a young person's true inner strengths and help them focus on the things that will energize them most throughout their whole lives! 
""Does it work??""
Great question! Short answer: YES. But you don't have to take our word for it; here are a few quotes from people who have used Dynamizer™ out in the real world:
""Our campers get so much from using Dynamizer! Living with serious illnesses and disabilities often causes these children to feel defined by their weaknesses. However, Dynamizer allows them to identify their individual strengths and talents. As they step away from being labeled by their illness, these wonderful children have the opportunity to overcome obstacles and grow in their capabilities. The focus of Dynamizer on individual strengths builds confidence and changes the way children perceive themselves for years to come."" — Erin Marie Ulmer, Executive Director, Camp Rise Above
""I have witnessed first-hand how Dynamizer provides an opportunity for young people to understand their own unique strengths and the strengths of others, helping them accept and respect differences as being positive and wonderful."" — Gene D’Agostino, Board of Directors, Oceanside Collegiate Academy
""As an executive coach and consultant, I find great value in identifying, understanding and leveraging one’s strengths. Dynamizer accomplishes this with young people in such a way that they can gain strategies early to live and thrive with a continuing picture of the best version of themselves. This has profound immediate and long-term implications for greater productivity, stronger relationships and effective direction. I strongly recommend Dynamizer for each and every child in your life."" — John Carroll, Author, The Great Big Book Of Goal Setting And Getting
""What's the difference between a 'deck' and a 'box?'""
A single deck is perfect for a dynamic discussion with 1 young person (or even 2 if you pair them up to share a deck!). The Dynamizer™ box contains 15 full decks, so it's perfect for groups up to 30 young people!
//

""What can I do with it?""
Share the power of energizing strengths with a young person in your life, and help...

Grow a young person's Self-Awareness — Dynamizer™ boosts self-awareness and self-esteem by providing deep personal insights about intrinsic motivators
Improve a young person's Relationships — Dynamizer™ improves communications and relationships by helping young people understand where other people are coming from
Build a young person's Self-Confidence — Dynamizer™ helps young people stand up to negative peer pressure by building self-confidence and resilience
Address Conflict & Bullying between young people — Dynamizer™ teaches how to constructively address interpersonal conflicts and helps prevent bullying by respecting differences

//


""Sounds great! What do you need me to do?""
It's pretty simple — we need funding to pay for the first-run production of Dynamizer™!
This project is a labor-of-love side-project for the three of us. We know it needs to exist, and we need your help to turn it into a real, tangible thing.
We're raising $19,500 to start — this will get us 1000 of the 15-pack Dynamizer boxes you see in the photos. This multi-pack will allow a teacher or youth leader to use just one box and teach 15-30 kids at a time about their strengths!
As you can imagine, there have been quite a few ""out of pocket"" expenses that the three of us have been self-funding just to get this thing going (product design, initial manufacturer costs, website design, game testing, legal fees, bank fees, etc.). Some of the $19,500 will pay us founders back for our initial investment, and the rest will go right back into creating more Dynamizer™ products to serve more kids!
//


""Why would I want to help with this?""
*Cue ""We Are The World, We Are The Children..."" music*
If even a little part of you believes that our children really are our future, we hope you'll donate and share. Everything about this project been designed to help young people everywhere learn about and utilize their strengths, because when a young person can LIVE in their strengths, everything about their life gets a little bit better...!

//


""Is it possible this WON'T get made and I won't get one?""

Short answer: no. We've already committed to this first order — they'll actually be arriving on the U.S. soil quite soon! 
Put another way: if you donate for a perk that includes a Dynamizer box, you WILL get one, guaranteed! 

""What will it cost when it's released?""
When it's made publicly available, the 15-pack Dynamizer™ box will be $79.95.
""What's that I hear about a 5% Give-Back Program??""
For every 100 Dynamizer™ boxes sold, we’ll donate 5 Dynamizer™ boxes to schools in income-challenged areas or community centers in income-challenged communities to help young people in all social situations learn more about their energizing strengths!
//

""Is donating money the only way I can help?""
Of course, we'd really appreciate a donation, even if it's $5 — a donation from everyone who sees this would likely exceed our goal! So please consider forgoing your weekly latte and helping a young person learn about their strengths.
That said, if you just can't donate, we understand!
In that case, please share this webpage with your network — you can share it with your local church youth pastor, someone who volunteers with the youth group, an instructor working with after school programs, a teacher or administrator at the school your kids attend, someone you know who works with Boys & Girls Clubs, Girl Scouts / Boy Scouts, or anyone else you know who cares about or works with young people ages 11+.
//


""What's next??""
We see Dynamizer™ as a movement, not a product, and we hope you'll join us on our mission to bring strengths to young people everywhere! After this product gets launched, we have a LOT more ideas for how to help young people utilize their strengths better and more powerfully in the world around them.
The ultimate goal of this project is to help make sure your kids (and everyone else's kids) end up in a career they love. And before then, a young person knowing their strengths will help them interact better with their classmates, stand up to peer pressure, and even help prevent bullying.

<h3><b>DDI is matching travel with tuition</b></h3>
<p>We've got great news! For every $3,500 we raise for one participant's travel and accommodation, the Deep Democracy Institute is giving a full tuition scholarship. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We are business and nonprofit leaders, artists, scientists, politicians, farmers, coaches and therapists, change managers and community leaders.  We work in fields as diverse as health, media, agriculture and environment, psychology, research, education, finance, and social work.  We represent different religious affiliations and political directions. </p>
<p><b>We share a common belief that awareness and facilitation can make our personal development and the development of organizations and nations less difficult and more effective and enjoyable</b>.</p>
<h3>Our challenge</h3>
<p>We have 60 days to achieve our target of $28,430. This will fund travel and accommodation for ten participants from conflict zones and currency disadvantaged countries to attend the DDI annual intensive training. </p>
<p>Travel and accommodation for each participant costs $3,500, a total of $35,000. We have independently raised $6,570 towards the funds. In this crowdfunding campaign we need to raise the remaining $28,430 for ten participants. Please donate as soon as possible to ensure time for visa arrangements and best travel deals!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

Together we did it 




In a nutshell... 



We, the Deep
Democracy Institute (DDI) international student community
are reaching out to you for your support. We are raising travel and accommodation funds for 10 participants from conflict zones and currency disadvantaged countries to attend the DDI annual 10 day leadership intensive training “Power, Love, War and Miracles” with 100+ participants from all continents, from 2nd to 11th October 2015 in Barcelona.

Your contribution will help people learn, practice and take deep democracy facilitation and conflict resolution capacities back home.  We believe that by investing in extraordinary grass roots and local leaders closest to the action, we are directly influencing a better world. 
DDI is matching travel with tuition
We've got great news! For every $3,500 we raise for one participant's travel and accommodation, the Deep Democracy Institute is giving a full tuition scholarship. 

Who are we?
We are business and nonprofit leaders, artists, scientists, politicians, farmers, coaches and therapists, change managers and community leaders.  We work in fields as diverse as health, media, agriculture and environment, psychology, research, education, finance, and social work.  We represent different religious affiliations and political directions. 
We share a common belief that awareness and facilitation can make our personal development and the development of organizations and nations less difficult and more effective and enjoyable.
Our challenge
We have 60 days to achieve our target of $28,430. This will fund travel and accommodation for ten participants from conflict zones and currency disadvantaged countries to attend the DDI annual intensive training. 
Travel and accommodation for each participant costs $3,500, a total of $35,000. We have independently raised $6,570 towards the funds. In this crowdfunding campaign we need to raise the remaining $28,430 for ten participants. Please donate as soon as possible to ensure time for visa arrangements and best travel deals!
Thank you!
Your contribution
Please join with us to reach our target, person by person. You can sponsor the travel and accommodation cost up to $3,500 for a single participant or give a smaller amount according to your means and interest. Every contribution counts!

Lead and facilitate diverse teams of up to 30 people for better and more effective collaboration, resolve conflict, and achieve high impact.


Lead and facilitate diverse groups of up to 1000 people through conflict into common ground and new initiatives.


Our DDI expert faculty are seasoned human beings and provide an inspirational learning environment through life experience, theory, practice and peer learning, in small and large groups.

This year, our 4th 10-Day Intensive Course in Deep Democracy and Worldwork facilitation is focusing on solutions with a creative twist, in:

highly diverse large groups
startups full of vision, and lacking resources
complex conflicted team constellations
multiple stakeholder processes without agreed upon ground rules
regional and national conflicts
the inner lives of creative change agents
co-operatives and grassroots movements trying to get their act together without compromising their egalitarian visions of collaboration.

<p></p>
<p>For those of you reading this, I'd like to start by saying thank you for simply taking the opportunity to do so. My name is Andre Williams and I'm a young and aspiring man looking to bring as much change as I can. I'm a passionately dedicated basketball player and the game is all I want to be around. I've played college basketball and am still doing so. I look to pursue to a career to keep playing after college as well. However, while I'm still chasing my dreams to make it professionally, I want to help someone else who wants the same. I figure I should do it now while I'm young and have all the resources necessary now. I already have an elite training group known as GymRatzPerformance. Seven days a week we train players from small kids to professionals and have over 600 clients. With that being said, I want to present to the world EMNH athletics in which I can have a facility to do all things required to get every athlete a scholarship to attend college for free. God has blessed me to be able to get a full athletic scholarship through hard work and most importantly the strongest support system for my parents. Not every athletes has that. So many of my teammates who were far much better than I was, never had the chances I've had because of that void with no support system. Which then led them to doing things that resulted into jail or sadly incidents surrounding death. I don't want that to happen anymore and I will be able to prevent it as much as possible by opening up a gym guaranteeing scholarships for education. I want equal opportunity for all and I'm willing to be the politician to speak for that. I'm determined and motivated. </p>
<p>""EMNH"" is a acronym that stands for ""Easy Money Nuttin' Honey."" It's something my father used to say at all of my games and that has stuck with me for years around all of my teammates and peers. Basically what it means is that whatever you want in life is achievable if you fully believe in your ability to conquer all obstacles. Nothing in life will be hard if you continue to work towards a dream. </p>
<p>The main goal of my campaign is to get every athlete free college education and potentially opportunities to play professionally. With a facility to do so, my team and I can train at all hours and have many colleges and scouts welcomed to the gym to spectate on future athletes. We can host NCAA certified events and expose all opportunities to those looking to cease them. There are far too many kids with so much potential to be great yet they lack the resources. Furthermore, in preparing athletes for competition, I look to also use the facility to shelter kids from problems they may be facing. I want it to be their great escape. A large sports facility can help bridge the gap between many who play sports for their schools, yet don't know how to obtain all the scholarship money for their athletic potential. Not many schools within the area or surrounding areas help student athletes as well. Athletes must travel out of their way to get the decent exposure that might land them in college. Therefore, I want to fill what's missing that's keeping so much talent out of school.</p>
<p>With the help of contributors who believe in my idea, I think this will be all very successful. My goal is to obtain 100,000 dollars to start the offer on a commercial sized building. I will then reach out to a board of angel investors to help with any other funds. Please help me create this dream so I can also help create the dream of many others. Sometimes all a person needs is a chance to prove they are worth something major. A simple investment shows how much you are willing to give someone a chance.  Share my campaign and story.

Social media, satire news shows, and digital news sources are now the preferred way to gather news/info. with this younger generation, mostly with a mobile device.

   Risks & Challenges 
Our biggest risk is not getting the money we need (duh).  With careful planning, we do have multiple backup plans to finish this product with whatever we are able to obtain.  Our plans also include finishing up this project with just the one camera, one microphone set-up we have now.
Other challenges we have are traveling to the different Islands to get their stories about our past ali'i.  We would like to use as little money as possible.  The biggest would be paying for flights and ground transportation. We will also save money by staying with family and friends on the various islands.

<p>Three years ago Athan and I travelled to
Greece on our way to Italy. But a funny thing happened as it often does when
you set out firm plans. Athan was born here in Greece and I had always wanted
to visit the Greek islands. But I<b> fell in love with the land and its simple
lifestyle, sun and sea and natural foods</b>. It didn’t take much to convince Athan
that his native land was the place to be. </p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439622663/vnnyuqudyp4vinytvgmp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">To the surprise of many, we packed up our
life in Toronto and </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">moved to Greece in search of the best olive oil,</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> thinking
that Artemis could export to North America where consumers were becoming more health
conscious of the benefits of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) at the same time as

<p>As health conscious consumers, we wanted to
know more for ourselves and that is when Athan discovered the work of <b>Drs.
Magiatis and Melliou at the University of Athens</b>. Dr. Magiatis had come across <b>references
in ancient texts to the medicinal benefits of early harvest olive oil</b> and, like
any great scientist; he followed his curiosity, which led to his Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance method to measure individual health-enhancing phenolic
compounds in olive oil. </p>
<p>What began as an interest became a passion.
<b>Greece has some of the finest olive oils in the world</b> and in ancient times
exported olive oil around the known world. After all, Athens was named for
Athena who planted an olive tree on the Acropolis as a gift of life to the new
city, and ancient Olympic athletes were crowned with a wreath of olive leaves. </p>
<p>Athan wondered <b>what had happened to the Greek export empire</b> as it now lagged behind its Mediterranean neighbours. He
discovered that much of the oil in Greece was exported for the lowest bulk prices
to other countries, which often mixed it with native blends. He also discovered that
many small growers barely sustained themselves tending olive groves inherited
through generations.</p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><br/></b></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Aristoleo™

<p>So last year my company, <a href=""http://artemisallianceinc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://artemisallianceinc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Artemis Alliance Inc.</a>.*
<b>partnered with the University of Athens </b>to
support research in ways to test the medicinal polyphenols in EVOO (Extra
Virgin Olive Oil). The result was a product named Aristoleo™ (Greek patent
pending). <b>Literally meaning “excellent oil” Aristoleo™</b> is an inexpensive
handheld test kit to measure the two most abundant and medicinally rich
phenolic compounds found in olive oil: <b>Oleocanthal and Oleacein</b>. </p>
<p>Research scientists <b>Drs. Prokopious Magiatis and Eleni Melliou</b> and their team at the
University of Athens had discovered a method to measure these health-promoting
elements using NMR or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. When we first met, Greece was
deep in the economic crisis, the university research funds had been cut and at
one point the teaching staff was cleaning their own washrooms. </p><p><b>We wanted to help</b>. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437650337/halrbfzkaskbgew4moii.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Testing by NMR cannot be done in the field.
The team decided something was needed to help growers and producers in the

<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Olive Oil contributes .5% to Greece's GDP</b>. In this time of crisis, Greek EVOO can compete on the world market at

<p>·<span> 
</span>Based on Aristoleo™ test
results, <b>simple adjustments to harvest and production practices can significantly
increase the levels of polyphenols</b>, Oleocanthal and Oleacein in olive oil to
increase value.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Small growers often live

      Measures the Healthfulness of 
               Extra Virgin Olive OilGreek Translation
Aristoleo™
identifies the healthiest olive oils in the world.

“Aristoleo™
Test Kit is
a new Greek invention for measuring significant health promoting
phenolic compounds in olive oil: oleocanthal and oleacein. The test is a hand held ""lab in a vial"" that quickly measures the
healthfulness of olive oil. 
""Aristoleo™
Test Kit can discover the healthiest olive oils, guarantee the quality, increase the
value and raise the profile of this superior nutritional food""  said Marilyn Harding, Director of Artemis Alliance Inc. Hi, I’m Marilyn Harding, director of
Artemis Alliance Inc.
Today, we are asking for your help to raise funds to bring Artistoleo™ Test Kit to market in Greece and other olive oil producing countries around the world. Artemis is ready to go into production
with Aristoleo™ test kit. It accurately measures
the health promoting compounds, oleocanthal and oleacein, in Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO). Aristoleo™ Test Kit represents a major scientific breakthrough and the only one of its kind in the world. We want to get this into the hands of olive producers for this coming harvest. Growing interest in the distribution of Aristoleo™ Test Kit from other olive oil producing countries in the EU and around the world requires us to apply for greater patent and trademark protection and to increase production to meet global demand.                                       Your donation will get us there in time!What your donations will be used for this year.
1. Patent and Aristoleo™ Licensing and Trademark Registration €15,000
2. Manufacturing and Distribution €12,000
3. Colorimetric iPhone App €3000
If the goal isn't reached where do the funds go? The funds raised will be equally split between Patent and Aristoleo™ Licensing and Trademark Registration & Manufacturing and Distribution
What if we exceed our goal?
We are committed to helping the Greek Olive Growers and Producers prosper even under the dire constraints and extra taxes imposed by the debt crisis not to mention  the tough conditions Mother Nature sometimes imposes. 
Aristoleo™ test kits will be made available free of charge to those who cannot afford it. There are many excellent High Phenolic EVOOs being produced by small independent olive growers who would benefit by getting higher prices for their product by having access to Aristoleo™ test kits.Aristoleo™ Test Kit allows olive growers, olive
mills
and
distributors to
quickly
test
and sort olive oil based
on its healthfullness. Consumers are willing to pay a higher price
for EVOOs proven to contain health protective high phenolic compounds. Eurobank named Aristoleo™ in the top ten innovations in Greece in a recent contest (winner announcement postponed due to bank crisis). The
EU labeling regulation 432/2012 allows
a health claim to be made on the label of EVOO if it contains at
least 250mg of phenolic compounds per kg.
Aristoleo™ test kit has already discovered EVOOs that contain many times the minimum requirement. These EVOOs sell for a higher price for a good reason. They are healthier and have a higher medicinal value.

Here
in Greece a little goes a long way.
Your
donation has a lot of leverage and you will be helping Greek science and
research at the University of Athens, the individual olive growers and the
Greek olive oil industry as a whole to thrive on the world market contributing to
the wellbeing of Greece in its time of deep economic crisis. My article from HuffPost.gr Greek  English TranslationWhy
are we passionate?
Three years ago Athan and I travelled to
Greece on our way to Italy. But a funny thing happened as it often does when
you set out firm plans. Athan was born here in Greece and I had always wanted
to visit the Greek islands. But I fell in love with the land and its simple
lifestyle, sun and sea and natural foods. It didn’t take much to convince Athan
that his native land was the place to be. 
To the surprise of many, we packed up our
life in Toronto and moved to Greece in search of the best olive oil, thinking
that Artemis could export to North America where consumers were becoming more health
conscious of the benefits of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) at the same time as
they were becoming disillusioned by many accounts of fraud and scams on EVOO
labelling. Too many had discovered high price was no guarantee of quality.
As health conscious consumers, we wanted to
know more for ourselves and that is when Athan discovered the work of Drs.
Magiatis and Melliou at the University of Athens. Dr. Magiatis had come across references
in ancient texts to the medicinal benefits of early harvest olive oil and, like
any great scientist; he followed his curiosity, which led to his Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance method to measure individual health-enhancing phenolic
compounds in olive oil. 
What began as an interest became a passion.
Greece has some of the finest olive oils in the world and in ancient times
exported olive oil around the known world. After all, Athens was named for
Athena who planted an olive tree on the Acropolis as a gift of life to the new
city, and ancient Olympic athletes were crowned with a wreath of olive leaves. 
Athan wondered what had happened to the Greek export empire as it now lagged behind its Mediterranean neighbours. He
discovered that much of the oil in Greece was exported for the lowest bulk prices
to other countries, which often mixed it with native blends. He also discovered that
many small growers barely sustained themselves tending olive groves inherited
through generations.Aristoleo™
The Invention
So last year my company, Artemis Alliance Inc..*
partnered with the University of Athens to
support research in ways to test the medicinal polyphenols in EVOO (Extra
Virgin Olive Oil). The result was a product named Aristoleo™ (Greek patent
pending). Literally meaning “excellent oil” Aristoleo™ is an inexpensive
handheld test kit to measure the two most abundant and medicinally rich
phenolic compounds found in olive oil: Oleocanthal and Oleacein. 
Research scientists Drs. Prokopious Magiatis and Eleni Melliou and their team at the
University of Athens had discovered a method to measure these health-promoting
elements using NMR or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. When we first met, Greece was
deep in the economic crisis, the university research funds had been cut and at
one point the teaching staff was cleaning their own washrooms. We wanted to help. Testing by NMR cannot be done in the field.
The team decided something was needed to help growers and producers in the
field to achieve quick and accurate measurement for phenolic compounds. And
that was Aristoleo™ - a lab in a vial.
Arisoleo™ is verified by NMR for accuracy.
We immediately saw Aristoleo™ as a three-pronged benefit.
1.  Support research and
innovation in Greece 
2.  Support the olive oil
industry in Greece
3.  Promote the health
benefits of EVOO to the worldWhat
this means ...
For
Greek Research and Innovation:

· 
Science and research can flourish in Greece.
· 
50% of Aristoleo™ profits go
the University of Athens and Dr. Magiatis to fund continuing research. 
· 
Global patent will protect
intellectual property and keep it in Greece.For Olive Growers and Producers:
“It’s a great tool that we
use routinely for in house evaluation of high quality olive oil. Inexpensive,
quick and reliable” commented
Kostas Peimanidis of Agrovim the largest olive oil producer and exporter in
Kalamata, Greece.
· 
Olive Oil contributes .5% to Greece's GDP. In this time of crisis, Greek EVOO can compete on the world market at
the very best prices based on proven quality. A rise in prices results in a rise
in GDP. 
· 
Based on Aristoleo™ test
results, simple adjustments to harvest and production practices can significantly
increase the levels of polyphenols, Oleocanthal and Oleacein in olive oil to
increase value.
· 
Small growers often live
subsistence lives, harvesting and selling for lowest bulk prices just to meet
their immediate living needs. Being able to test batches for higher phenolic
content means higher prices.
· 
Average historic prices for
bulk olive oil range from €2.50 - €3.20/kg. This year EVOO tested (by NMR and
Aristoleo™) with proven high phenolic content sold for up to €15/kg in bulk.
· 
With the recent EU debt
restructuring, taxes have just increased on farmers already beleaguered by the
depressed economy and the vulnerability of weather and pests on crops. Olive growers need every advantage they can get.
“We tested the Aristoleo™
prototype last year in our olive mill and I also use it to demonstrate the
superiority of our olive oil to our customers,” said Spyros Dafnis, owner of award winning The
Governor brand. “Corfu up until
two years ago had a reputation for producing below average olive oil. Today,
thanks to Aristoleo™ Test Kit and Magiatis - Melliou research, Corfu Island is
now producing one of the highest phenolic olive oils in the world.”· 
Mills can separate EVOOs
quickly during the busy harvest and production time by field testing each batch
and sorting for premium pricing. 
· 
Greece has some of the highest
phenolic olive oils to serve a growing global community of health conscious
consumers.
· 
EU labelling allows a health
claim for High Phenolic Olive Oils increasing value and market share.For
the Health Conscious Consumer:
· 
The EU has instated a health
claim for the labelling of EVOOs, which contain 5mg of polyphenols per 20ml reduces
LDL oxidation – this means its good for your heart. 
In a study on the island of Crete, 12 young men (mean age: 21 years) who consumed 25 ml a day for
only four days of olive oils with varying levels of total phenols found that
the olive oil with a phenol content of 486 mg/kg could decrease LDL oxidation. 
· 
There is so much more to get
from EVOO. Research around the world continues to point out the anti-inflammatory
benefits of Oleocanthal for the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer’s, arthritis, and
cancer, heart disease and research continues. 
· 
Two tablespoons of High
Phenolic Olive Oils daily are truly medicinal in nature and a beneficial part
of a healthy eating and exercise regimen. 
· 
In past years there has been
much controversy over the quality of olive oils and the accuracy of labelling.
High price does not ensure quality, but the consumer is left in the dark –
until now. Health conscious consumers can be assured that the tested and
certified EVOOs they purchase are the quality they pay for. Aristoleo™ is ready to go into production now!Your quick response and generous donations (every € counts) will make sure we can reach as many producers as possible this harvest. We are launching in Greece and look forward to getting national permits to share this amazing invention to promote excellence everywhere EVOO is produced.Please share this with your friends and on all your social networks!Check out our
perks!What do you get in exchange besides great health generating EVOO on the market and knowing you’ve made a big difference? 
Every donation has enormous value and we
want to show our appreciation. All donors will be listed on the Aristoleo™  catalogue of the finest EVOOs in Greece and (coming soon) where to buy them
around the world. 
But there's more to look forward to!

</div> <div> <h3>THE IMPACT<br/>
</h3> <p></p>   Our purpose is to increase the number of men, women,  and --most importantly-- children reading fiction for pleasure. The sad truth is Americans don't read. In 2012 the NEA reported more than half (54%) of US citizens didn't read a single novel for pleasure, and PISA ranks America's students as 17th in Reading scores worldwide. 1 out of 5 American adults can't read past a 5th grade level, and a 2013 study shows teenagers are reading 7% fewer books than they did a only decade ago. <br/><br/>   We believe knowledge is mankind's greatest asset and the only tool we have to solve the social, biological, and economic problems of tomorrow. From global warming to a cure for cancer, no matter the challenge the solution requires education.

Public Library of America. </p>

</h3>   Besides giving, tweeting, or telling your book-loving friends about us, the best way you can help our cause, and to promote literacy, is to read. Read, read often, and be seen reading.

We’re the Enay Coaching team, coming to you live from Valdosta, GA! We’ve all known each other for a few years now, but it was in October 2013 that we started our journey together on this mission: to find and make a big deal of success stories in our local schools. We didn’t originally set out to start a new company—we only wanted to bring attention to anything great that was going on in our schools, and hopefully rally some community support around those success stories. We feel that it is a responsibility of businesses to help their local schools prepare students for the future, so we figured we’d lead by example!</p><p><b><br/></b></p><h2><b>What’s the Enay Project About?</b></h2>Well, a few classroom visits turned into some requests to do presentations on some of our skills, like graphic design, web design, photography, and the like. Soon, we created some worksheets to go with our presentations, which teachers assigned as extra credit to their classes. Then we came up with some “get-on-your-feet” interactive learning games to teach students about the heart behind the work that we do. We taught about leadership, teamwork, communication skills, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship—and we learned something along the way: while schools are increasing the effort to teach students the right skills for the 21st century workplace, skills alone are not enough. There has to be a certain mindset at work behind those skills. We call it <b>Legacy-Minded Servant-Leadership™</b>, and we found a way to successfully collaborate with great schools and great teachers to coach students in that mindset. It caught on. <p><b><br/></b></p><h2><b>What We’ve Done With Basic Support</b></h2>Over 1000 volunteer hours and 3000 research hours later, we had a really strong program going, and lots of data to show the impact of our work—and yes, it was working! We even launched another arm of our project to help fund the first part: in the summer of 2014 we started tutoring students in Math and English Language Arts. That was working, too! <p><br/></p><p></p><h2>Business Plan Competition Winners!<br/>
</h2><p><b></b>Finally, in January 2015, the results of a local business plan competition hosted by the Valdosta/Lowndes Chamber of Commerce and Southwest Georgia Bank were announced—Enay Coaching, LLC was the winner! With a $10,000 prize plus lots of in-kind support, we were able to launch the business forward. We established partnerships in three school districts, took on keynote and conference presentation opportunities, upgraded our website, and started a major tutoring contract in a neighboring county. We now have four employees and two contract team members, all passionate about our company mission: cultivating Legacy-Minded Servant-Leaders™!  </p><p><b></b>Our growth has been steady and DEBT-FREE, and we’re keeping it that way! And now we need your help to meet our goal to raise $75,000 and propel this mission forward. </p><p><b><br/></b></p><h2><b>What We’ll Do With Your Support</b></h2>Here’s where your support will go: We’re getting ready to take our curriculum online so that it is available to students across the nation. We are launching a professional development series for educators—produced at the request of educators! We have grown our tutoring services and impact, and soon we will be providing professional excellence training and certification for tutors in partnership with Valdosta State University and Wiregrass Technical College. <br/><br/><p>We believe our best investment is to coach other leaders to carry our message forward and reach countless others with the same message. With your help, we’ll be able to make our work accessible to anyone who has a heart for Legacy-Minded Servant-Leadership™ in every area of life.<br/><br/></p><p><b>We’ve shown what we can do with our volunteer time.

We’re the Enay Coaching team, coming to you live from Valdosta, GA! We’ve all known each other for a few years now, but it was in October 2013 that we started our journey together on this mission: to find and make a big deal of success stories in our local schools. We didn’t originally set out to start a new company—we only wanted to bring attention to anything great that was going on in our schools, and hopefully rally some community support around those success stories. We feel that it is a responsibility of businesses to help their local schools prepare students for the future, so we figured we’d lead by example!What’s the Enay Project About?Well, a few classroom visits turned into some requests to do presentations on some of our skills, like graphic design, web design, photography, and the like. Soon, we created some worksheets to go with our presentations, which teachers assigned as extra credit to their classes. Then we came up with some “get-on-your-feet” interactive learning games to teach students about the heart behind the work that we do. We taught about leadership, teamwork, communication skills, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship—and we learned something along the way: while schools are increasing the effort to teach students the right skills for the 21st century workplace, skills alone are not enough. There has to be a certain mindset at work behind those skills. We call it Legacy-Minded Servant-Leadership™, and we found a way to successfully collaborate with great schools and great teachers to coach students in that mindset. It caught on. What We’ve Done With Basic SupportOver 1000 volunteer hours and 3000 research hours later, we had a really strong program going, and lots of data to show the impact of our work—and yes, it was working! We even launched another arm of our project to help fund the first part: in the summer of 2014 we started tutoring students in Math and English Language Arts. That was working, too! Business Plan Competition Winners!
Finally, in January 2015, the results of a local business plan competition hosted by the Valdosta/Lowndes Chamber of Commerce and Southwest Georgia Bank were announced—Enay Coaching, LLC was the winner! With a $10,000 prize plus lots of in-kind support, we were able to launch the business forward. We established partnerships in three school districts, took on keynote and conference presentation opportunities, upgraded our website, and started a major tutoring contract in a neighboring county. We now have four employees and two contract team members, all passionate about our company mission: cultivating Legacy-Minded Servant-Leaders™!  Our growth has been steady and DEBT-FREE, and we’re keeping it that way! And now we need your help to meet our goal to raise $75,000 and propel this mission forward. What We’ll Do With Your SupportHere’s where your support will go: We’re getting ready to take our curriculum online so that it is available to students across the nation. We are launching a professional development series for educators—produced at the request of educators! We have grown our tutoring services and impact, and soon we will be providing professional excellence training and certification for tutors in partnership with Valdosta State University and Wiregrass Technical College. We believe our best investment is to coach other leaders to carry our message forward and reach countless others with the same message. With your help, we’ll be able to make our work accessible to anyone who has a heart for Legacy-Minded Servant-Leadership™ in every area of life.We’ve shown what we can do with our volunteer time. We’ve shown what we can do with a $10,000 prize.

</p>
<p>I am looking for funding to create a service that can help bring an end to
loneliness, depression, addiction, sexual abuse, and suicide for the students.
Since most students not living in residence experience loneliness. But studies
have suggested that there is a strong link between loneliness and the
social problems that I have mentioned. The most significant consequence of
loneliness is suicide, which has taken away more lives of young people than
most could imagine. </p>
<p>My name is Godwin. I believe there is a reason why a former Harvard
psychologist and current University of Toronto Professor Dr. Jordan Peterson
was asking all his students to each take on a social problem for a class
assignment. Since no one would believe there is a solution to loneliness,
unless the speaker has a PhD or could find studies to prove why this solution
is valid. So I have spent over 12 years in doing research, until I have found a
way in using studies to show that, there is in fact, a non-religious, easy but
effective approach to making friends and getting out of loneliness, that
can be a great help to people who need to achieve these
goals. I did it because somebody has to spend the time to do this or a
significant amount of students could be suffering in loneliness or depression
for years by following advice that does not work. My wish is to bring
relationship education/science to everyone who wants to be less lonely. My
dream is being able to help remove the biggest amount of suffering for people
in this world and bringing a great joy to them. I want to use what I have
learned to create a service to help students, by offering them the
opportunities to make friends and the opportunities to learn about
relationship science. This service will cost between $13 and $20
million. However, if we
remove 25% from the $13 million service, the amount that Professor
Peterson said is good to have ready for unforeseeable expenses, then
the service would only cost $9.75 million. Your support
will help to spark a change in this world that can stop hurtful or
dysfunctional relationship patterns from getting passed down from one
generation to the next. This will help a great number of children and young people
throughout their lives.</p>

<p>*Please note, a chair professor of a graduate school program who has

<p><b>The Professors that are supporting what I think that can help a lot of
students</b></p>
<p>Even though my work including this fundraising project has received no
institutional support from the University of Toronto, but a number of U of T
professors have agreed to help me on their own. This includes a clinical
psychologist, a social psychologist, a relationship psychologist, as well as a
professor who was also the Principal of Victoria College, one of the most
respected colleges at U of T when he was being interviewed. Please go to the
bottom to see the full list of professors who have shown their support for
bringing relationship education to high school and/or elementary school
students. </p>
<p>**Please note, my work has taken up most of my time, so I am not active on
social media. But Professor Peterson has helped me by suggesting me to create a
fundraising campaign on Indiegogo. If you see his public facebook page being
linked to this campaign at the bottom of this page, then this means he has
already read through what I have written and has agreed to support the
campaign. In addition, Professor Peterson is also showing his support to this
campaign on his personal <u><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/dr.jordan.b.peterson?fref=pb&amp;hc_location=friends_tab&amp;pnref=friends.all"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Facebook</strong></a></u> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><u>Twitter

     helping to spark a change that can benefit millions of people for life.</li>
<li>
<b>A Clarification: </b>Indiegogo
     will close this campaign if we fail to reach the goal of $2.5 million by
     29 September 2015. But if we reach that goal, we will have until February
     2016 to raise the $13 million needed for the service. </li>

<p><b>A Service that can help so many students </b></p>
<p>This service is a place where people can go to find a solution to loneliness
and learn how to use relationship science to build stronger friendships with
peers. This means even high school or elementary school students will have a
chance to learn relationship knowledge that has been tested by science or time.
Students can also get to meet others who are open to making new friends.
Relationship Psychologist Geoff MacDonald and other U of T professors have all
agreed that I should put this idea into action, even though this idea has
received no institutional support from the University of Toronto. I have once
created a group using this idea that has helped students to increase their
chances in making friends by 3000%. The students who have joined this group
have gone from 20 to 120 in a 3-year period. </p>
<p>Students can come in with no friends and coming out with a group of friends
in 3 months. My approach is effective, as I have spent years to study why
others have failed to help students to make friends and getting out of
loneliness. So I know what works and what doesn’t work in helping students.
Creating this service would give students a real chance to get out of their
loneliness. Otherwise many students are trapped in loneliness, as they cannot
find effective help anywhere. According to <i>The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce:
A 25-Year Landmark Study</i>, <u>40 % of single mothers live below the poverty
line</u> while their children are more likely to experience loneliness than
children in two-parent homes. Children of these single mothers are therefore
more likely to have fewer financial resources to cope with loneliness than
children from intact families. After working 2 or 3 jobs and cooking, many
single mothers have little or no time and energy left to spend with their kids.
The social life of the older child might also suffer from having to care for a
younger sibling(s).</p>
<p>But living below the poverty line, for many people, means not having enough
food to eat. I recently watched a documentary movie in which a child received
food at school through a special program. But instead of eating his food, the
child hid it---he wanted to take the food home so that his mother could eat.
This gave me the idea of making part of this service into a cafeteria or
something that sells food and drinks to people, but also offers free meals to
students who are children of single mothers in poverty. So these single mothers
do not have to spend time making food after long hours of work and they can
spend time with their children instead. The cost of creating this service is
estimated to be $13 million as the rent alone could cost $2.4 million for a
20-year period. Since the rent at the heart of downtown Toronto is very
expensive. But the goal of this service is to establish something permanent
that people can go to and find a solution to loneliness, or how can we help so
many lonely people? So the giving out of free meals for 20 years would only
happen if enough donations were received. But if the donations have exceeded
our expectation, I want to add a service that helps students to take care of a
younger sibling so students with young sibling can come to learn and make new
friends.</p>
<p><b>Why create a service now but not after I got my book published first? </b></p>
<p>It has been said that the only way for academic writing to be taken seriously
by scholars is for it to be published by a reputable publisher. So I must wait
like everyone else. But many people seem to think that, just because it is not
their children but somebody else’s children who are lonely and needing help,
then it is better to wait than to help immediately. However, justice means do
unto others, like how you would like others to do unto you. So I think it is
unfair to keep so many students away from what can easily help them to make
friends and alleviating loneliness. Relationship Psychologist Geoff MacDonald
can tell you more about the pain of loneliness, if you watch the video at the
top of this page. </p>
<p><b>Why needs millions for creating a service to help students to make
friends? </b></p>
<p>When this idea was first conceived, it was meant to become a service for all
the students at U of T. At that time, Professor Michel Ferrari said he could
get a graduate department to pay for half of its cost, if the university was
willing to pay for the other half. But if the university were unwilling to do
so, then the graduate department would not be willing to pay anything, because
the graduate department could only financially support a project that has the
support of the university administration. But the university administration did
not agree to provide this funding, even though it knew I had and I still have
the support of professors.  </p>
<p>This is why the creation of this service would need so much money from the
public. For example, the University of Toronto alone has about 64,000 students.
But according to the January 12, 2015 issue of MacLean’s magazine, last year, a
survey has revealed, 64 % of Canadian university and college students felt
“very lonely” in the last 12 months.  So it is possible that over 40,000
students are being affected by loneliness at U of T alone. But studies have
suggested a link between loneliness, depression and suicide. So when 64 % of
university students are suffering from loneliness, we need to take this issue
seriously. But there are also college students, high school students and
elementary school students who are lonely and needing help. Could students
afford to help themselves? Maybe a few. But too many students struggle
financially and I do not think we should only help the students who can afford
to pay but leaving the rest of the students to suffer in loneliness. This is
why I want to create a long-term solution or a permanent service in the first
place. A service like this would require me to rent a large space —ideally 3000
sq. ft.—for students to drop in and get help, either alone or as a group. A
large space is essential. Many students need help—and would much rather find
their way out of loneliness or depression through friendships than through
prescriptive medication. But this rent would cost $25,000 a month, as the rent
at the heart of downtown Toronto is expensive. It seems that without the free
spaces that can be provided by a university, rent suddenly becomes an issue
that needs generous assistance.</p>
<p>It is because this rent alone would cost $6 million, for a 20-year
period. But we also need to spend money on hiring people too. According to
professors, hiring educated people is expensive or the average wage of a
graduate student is $40 per hour. But being a graduate student, even in the
field of psychology, does not guarantee a person’s ability in helping others in
alleviating loneliness, otherwise the loneliness problem would have been solved
by North American psychologists a long time ago. However, Relationship
Psychologist Professor Geoff MacDonald said it is difficult to find a quality
relationship science instructor. This can mean the cost of hiring a good
relationship science instructor could far exceed $40 per hour. So helping a lot
of students is doable, provided if I have the money that allows me to hire the
best people. As the cost of hiring one person with such qualification
above, for 20 years, can cost $1.54 million, but I will need to hire many
people in order to help so many students. Renting a smaller space is possible
but that would still cost $10,000 a month or $2.4 million for a 20-year period.
Since I know many students might rather be on the waiting list than not getting
any effective help at all. </p>
<p>It is understandable that the University of Toronto administrators would
want to see studies that can show my approach to loneliness is effective. But
absolute proof would take years to determine. According to a
former Head of Research and Senior Scientist at the Centre for
Addiction and Mental Health Professor Dr. Tony Toneatto, repeated study is a
good way to find irrefutable truth. This means that the same study is being
repeated multiple times by scientists from different parts of the world but
still reaching similar results. But who would want to wait that long? 
When so many students in North America are suffering and needing a way out of
loneliness, my priority is helping students now. So I need people to
support with me with donations. I will be in charge of this service once it is
created and will decide where each dollar will go. This will save a lot of time
and the job will get done.</p>
<p>If anyone is giving us a free space that we need to create a permanent
service for students, we can even put your name right in front of the name of
our service. Please note, I did say the estimated cost of creating the service
is between $13 and $20 million. The first number is the minimum cost of $9.75
million plus back up funding for unforeseeable expenses, something Professor
Peterson said I should keep in mind when I am asking for funding. For example,
I might hire extra people to meet the needs of students, such as creating
a 24-hour telephone hot line or a live chat online service for
students who have questions about relationship science but cannot come to this
service in person. The second number is adding $6 million to the first, the
price of renting a 3000 sq. ft. for 20 years, plus the Indiegogo platform fee
for Indiegogo In Demand, which is 5% of $20 million, that is not the
same as the 9% Indiegogo Flexible Funding Fee. </p>
<p><b>What if the donations are over $2.5 million but far below $9.75 million? </b></p>
<p>I would use this money to create a service for helping individual school
that wishes to create a relation education program for their students that is
based on Western and Eastern relationship science. Since I believe the
understanding of Western relationship science alone, is helpful but
insufficient in helping the students with their loneliness problem. I would use
this money for the cost of doing additional research too, as there are some
topics that I would like to add into my current integrative
research. I can create an office for individual consultation as well. </p>

<p>*But you can also help us by telling other people about this campaign.</p>
<p>In addition, Professor Peterson said the best approach in fundraising is
honesty. So I must say I cannot offer any tangible perk to people who donate to
this fundraising campaign. Since I have never received any money for helping
others, for this work that I have been doing, for the last 13 to 14 years. But
I have also given everything that a human being could possibly give into
this work for both time and money. As I believe time is everything when it
comes to helping people that are being trapped in devastating suffering. This
is why I have nothing much to offer to my friends, but many of them still have
done the best that they could do to help me over the years, by giving me moral,
instrumental, or financial support, until there is nothing more that they could
give me. For the reasons above, I hope you can forgive me for unable to offer
any tangible perk to anyone who donates. But I believe the intangible perks
that my campaign offers are still valuable. <u>As these perks will offer
people a chance to voice their opinions and enough public opinions can
sometimes be enough to get some schools or universities to create necessary
changes to help students</u>. <u>So your opinion(s) might help more students
than you could imagine</u>. </p>
<p>Please note, any perk that is related to paying for an instructor to offer a
relationship science lesson or workshop to students, can only be fulfilled, if
the total donations that I receive cover the cost of creating a service for
students. </p>

</div></div>","The Story



















I am looking for funding to create a service that can help bring an end to
loneliness, depression, addiction, sexual abuse, and suicide for the students.
Since most students not living in residence experience loneliness. But studies
have suggested that there is a strong link between loneliness and the
social problems that I have mentioned. The most significant consequence of
loneliness is suicide, which has taken away more lives of young people than
most could imagine. 
My name is Godwin. I believe there is a reason why a former Harvard
psychologist and current University of Toronto Professor Dr. Jordan Peterson
was asking all his students to each take on a social problem for a class
assignment. Since no one would believe there is a solution to loneliness,
unless the speaker has a PhD or could find studies to prove why this solution
is valid. So I have spent over 12 years in doing research, until I have found a
way in using studies to show that, there is in fact, a non-religious, easy but
effective approach to making friends and getting out of loneliness, that
can be a great help to people who need to achieve these
goals. I did it because somebody has to spend the time to do this or a
significant amount of students could be suffering in loneliness or depression
for years by following advice that does not work. My wish is to bring
relationship education/science to everyone who wants to be less lonely. My
dream is being able to help remove the biggest amount of suffering for people
in this world and bringing a great joy to them. I want to use what I have
learned to create a service to help students, by offering them the
opportunities to make friends and the opportunities to learn about
relationship science. This service will cost between $13 and $20
million. However, if we
remove 25% from the $13 million service, the amount that Professor
Peterson said is good to have ready for unforeseeable expenses, then
the service would only cost $9.75 million. Your support
will help to spark a change in this world that can stop hurtful or
dysfunctional relationship patterns from getting passed down from one
generation to the next. This will help a great number of children and young people
throughout their lives.

Does anyone know how much loneliness, depression and suicide are affecting
people in North America including the young people today?

*Please note, a chair professor of a graduate school program who has
verified my finding with other professor was suggesting me to include a list of
references of the sources that my writing is based on. So you can look up all
these studies yourself. You can also click the Updates tab at the top and
find out what was affecting so many Canadians that were between the ages of
15 to 24.
The Professors that are supporting what I think that can help a lot of
students
Even though my work including this fundraising project has received no
institutional support from the University of Toronto, but a number of U of T
professors have agreed to help me on their own. This includes a clinical
psychologist, a social psychologist, a relationship psychologist, as well as a
professor who was also the Principal of Victoria College, one of the most
respected colleges at U of T when he was being interviewed. Please go to the
bottom to see the full list of professors who have shown their support for
bringing relationship education to high school and/or elementary school
students. 
**Please note, my work has taken up most of my time, so I am not active on
social media. But Professor Peterson has helped me by suggesting me to create a
fundraising campaign on Indiegogo. If you see his public facebook page being
linked to this campaign at the bottom of this page, then this means he has
already read through what I have written and has agreed to support the
campaign. In addition, Professor Peterson is also showing his support to this
campaign on his personal Facebook and Twitter
pages.
About the donations

Donations can be any
     amount you wish (e.g. can be $1, $2, $5). This is a low price to pay for
     helping to spark a change that can benefit millions of people for life.

A Clarification: Indiegogo
     will close this campaign if we fail to reach the goal of $2.5 million by
     29 September 2015. But if we reach that goal, we will have until February
     2016 to raise the $13 million needed for the service.

A Service that can help so many students 
This service is a place where people can go to find a solution to loneliness
and learn how to use relationship science to build stronger friendships with
peers. This means even high school or elementary school students will have a
chance to learn relationship knowledge that has been tested by science or time.
Students can also get to meet others who are open to making new friends.
Relationship Psychologist Geoff MacDonald and other U of T professors have all
agreed that I should put this idea into action, even though this idea has
received no institutional support from the University of Toronto. I have once
created a group using this idea that has helped students to increase their
chances in making friends by 3000%. The students who have joined this group
have gone from 20 to 120 in a 3-year period. 
Students can come in with no friends and coming out with a group of friends
in 3 months. My approach is effective, as I have spent years to study why
others have failed to help students to make friends and getting out of
loneliness. So I know what works and what doesn’t work in helping students.
Creating this service would give students a real chance to get out of their
loneliness. Otherwise many students are trapped in loneliness, as they cannot
find effective help anywhere. According to The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce:
A 25-Year Landmark Study, 40 % of single mothers live below the poverty
line while their children are more likely to experience loneliness than
children in two-parent homes. Children of these single mothers are therefore
more likely to have fewer financial resources to cope with loneliness than
children from intact families. After working 2 or 3 jobs and cooking, many
single mothers have little or no time and energy left to spend with their kids.
The social life of the older child might also suffer from having to care for a
younger sibling(s).
But living below the poverty line, for many people, means not having enough
food to eat. I recently watched a documentary movie in which a child received
food at school through a special program. But instead of eating his food, the
child hid it---he wanted to take the food home so that his mother could eat.
This gave me the idea of making part of this service into a cafeteria or
something that sells food and drinks to people, but also offers free meals to
students who are children of single mothers in poverty. So these single mothers
do not have to spend time making food after long hours of work and they can
spend time with their children instead. The cost of creating this service is
estimated to be $13 million as the rent alone could cost $2.4 million for a
20-year period. Since the rent at the heart of downtown Toronto is very
expensive. But the goal of this service is to establish something permanent
that people can go to and find a solution to loneliness, or how can we help so
many lonely people? So the giving out of free meals for 20 years would only
happen if enough donations were received. But if the donations have exceeded
our expectation, I want to add a service that helps students to take care of a
younger sibling so students with young sibling can come to learn and make new
friends.
Why create a service now but not after I got my book published first? 
It has been said that the only way for academic writing to be taken seriously
by scholars is for it to be published by a reputable publisher. So I must wait
like everyone else. But many people seem to think that, just because it is not
their children but somebody else’s children who are lonely and needing help,
then it is better to wait than to help immediately. However, justice means do
unto others, like how you would like others to do unto you. So I think it is
unfair to keep so many students away from what can easily help them to make
friends and alleviating loneliness. Relationship Psychologist Geoff MacDonald
can tell you more about the pain of loneliness, if you watch the video at the
top of this page. 
Why needs millions for creating a service to help students to make
friends? 
When this idea was first conceived, it was meant to become a service for all
the students at U of T. At that time, Professor Michel Ferrari said he could
get a graduate department to pay for half of its cost, if the university was
willing to pay for the other half. But if the university were unwilling to do
so, then the graduate department would not be willing to pay anything, because
the graduate department could only financially support a project that has the
support of the university administration. But the university administration did
not agree to provide this funding, even though it knew I had and I still have
the support of professors.  
This is why the creation of this service would need so much money from the
public. For example, the University of Toronto alone has about 64,000 students.
But according to the January 12, 2015 issue of MacLean’s magazine, last year, a
survey has revealed, 64 % of Canadian university and college students felt
“very lonely” in the last 12 months.  So it is possible that over 40,000
students are being affected by loneliness at U of T alone. But studies have
suggested a link between loneliness, depression and suicide. So when 64 % of
university students are suffering from loneliness, we need to take this issue
seriously. But there are also college students, high school students and
elementary school students who are lonely and needing help. Could students
afford to help themselves? Maybe a few. But too many students struggle
financially and I do not think we should only help the students who can afford
to pay but leaving the rest of the students to suffer in loneliness. This is
why I want to create a long-term solution or a permanent service in the first
place. A service like this would require me to rent a large space —ideally 3000
sq. ft.—for students to drop in and get help, either alone or as a group. A
large space is essential. Many students need help—and would much rather find

our service. Please note, I did say the estimated cost of creating the service
is between $13 and $20 million. The first number is the minimum cost of $9.75

Recently I decided to go back to school and study again. <br/>I know, I am not the usual student that would normally ask for help to go to college. I am a 33 year old Berklee College of Music student whom has decided to follow her dream. I am not exactly a “freshman”. Before coming to Berklee in September 2014, I was already a school teacher in Italy. <br/><br/>I was born and raised in Sicily, in a family full of artists. I learned to paint and sing even before I was able to write!<br/><br/>At 10, I started my musical life, becoming part of the children’s choir in one of the main theaters in Italy. After 8 years singing Puccini and Bizet, Mozart and Britten, I was forced to stop because something personal came up in my life and I had to leave music completely. <br/><br/>I spent almost 8 years far away from the greatest passion of my life, and 5 years ago I finally found the courage to tell myself that I couldn’t live without music anymore, so I decided to study again the thing that I felt I was born to do! <br/><br/>After two bachelor degrees in psychopedagogy and education, two specializations in teaching methods for children with special needs and a masters in Infantile Glottodidactics, I decided to follow my dreams and come to Berklee.<br/><br/>Thirsty for learning always something new, I finally started studying what I was born to do and I am trying now to find a path to bridge my interests between theatre, the stage and the classroom.<br/><br/>I’ve had the chance to know Joey Blake and Circle Singing; a soulful kind of music brought in the USA from Africa, thanks to Bobby McFerrin. Now I’m studying to specialize in this type of music.<br/><br/>I am taking a sabbatical from teaching to advance my studies at Berklee. A few months ago, I was accepted in the Artist Diploma Program!!

Recently I decided to go back to school and study again. I know, I am not the usual student that would normally ask for help to go to college. I am a 33 year old Berklee College of Music student whom has decided to follow her dream. I am not exactly a “freshman”. Before coming to Berklee in September 2014, I was already a school teacher in Italy. I was born and raised in Sicily, in a family full of artists. I learned to paint and sing even before I was able to write!At 10, I started my musical life, becoming part of the children’s choir in one of the main theaters in Italy. After 8 years singing Puccini and Bizet, Mozart and Britten, I was forced to stop because something personal came up in my life and I had to leave music completely. I spent almost 8 years far away from the greatest passion of my life, and 5 years ago I finally found the courage to tell myself that I couldn’t live without music anymore, so I decided to study again the thing that I felt I was born to do! After two bachelor degrees in psychopedagogy and education, two specializations in teaching methods for children with special needs and a masters in Infantile Glottodidactics, I decided to follow my dreams and come to Berklee.Thirsty for learning always something new, I finally started studying what I was born to do and I am trying now to find a path to bridge my interests between theatre, the stage and the classroom.I’ve had the chance to know Joey Blake and Circle Singing; a soulful kind of music brought in the USA from Africa, thanks to Bobby McFerrin. Now I’m studying to specialize in this type of music.I am taking a sabbatical from teaching to advance my studies at Berklee. A few months ago, I was accepted in the Artist Diploma Program!! If you would help me reach my goal; I will be able to get my Diploma next spring semester; while also exploring my songwriting abilities.I’ve been awarded with a Scholarship, but still is not enough for me to accomplish my dream since I have been given a second chance in my life!! I I truly believe it’s never too late to do what you are deeply passionate about, and I believe in the power of our dreams. I hope you will consider helping and supporting me in this journey!

This audio guide will teach you how to be a confident and competent public speaker!This project is a result of the many people who have seen me speak across the world asking ""Where did you learn to speak like that?"" The answer is that it took me 25 years of research, work and practical experience. I have assisted hundreds of people on their public speaking journey, and now is the time to make this knowledge available to a wider audience so that you too can benefit.Public speaking is easier than you think if you know the correct techniques. I will teach you that public speaking is something that should be enjoyed and not feared. I will share my 2.5 decades of public speaking experience in 2.5 hours.Photo: Speaking at Nordic Travel Market, Helsinki. Courtesy of Andrew Chow (@IdeasAndrew)This is an audio guide with ten lessons. I chose an audio guide because there are some public speaking concepts that are very difficult (if not impossible) to explain in writing - especially vocal variety.Much of the work is complete!With the early written drafts and recordings already concluded, editing is currently underway to best present the ten lessons that cover writing, rehearsal and delivery of an effective presentation.The ten topic areas are covered below, though the titles may change slightly.Lesson One: Nerves Are Your FriendLesson Two: Know Your AudienceLesson Three: A Strong StructureLesson Four: Memorable Speech WritingLesson Five: The Power of StoriesLesson Six: Evoking Emotions In Your AudienceLesson Seven: How to Keep Your Audience InterestedLesson Eight: Being at Home on StageLesson Nine: Correct Use of Visual AidsLesson Ten: Handling Questions With EaseThese lessons vary in length depending on the information and their importance.Photo: Test recording to check for sound levels.Why Should You Support This Project?The cost of getting an audio book or audio guide professionally recorded and distributed are prohibitively high. Unlike selling a book or eBook, one must use a company with audio book experience to obtain a strong distribution network. I don't have the funds, but I have the voice and experience to record and distribute this product myself.Public speaking is a task we all have to perform at some point in our lives. You too can become a confident, competent public speaker by learning the correct techniques. This campaign will allow the guide to be produced and promoted so that this important knowledge can be available to a wide audience.You can make the task of producing this audio guide easier for me, as the money raised will provide a new computer in order to easily edit the sound files.

<p>Hello, I'm Stephanie Johnson and I'm the founder of Baby Bare: A bottom up approach to building strong brains and bodies. Baby Bare was inspired by the parents of the children I treat in my private practice in Minneapolis. The clients I see are struggling with attention and learning challenges often accompanied by anxiety and/or depression. The treatment model I use is a developmental movement modality that focuses on the development of the nervous system between the ages of 0-18 months. I assess what movement stages may have been incomplete or skipped altogether and then revisit those stages with clients to reorganize their brains and bodies to reduce symptoms and help them do their best in school. Through the years I've heard so many parents say to me ""I wish I would have known this when my child was a baby!"" </p>
<p>And so, Baby Bare was born! I began teaching classes to parents and teachers about the important role early movement has on brain development and realized there was a real need and desire for this information. </p>
<p>Baby Bare offers materials for everyone blessed with the important role of caring for babies: Parents, daycare providers and early educators.</p>
<p><b>1. For parents</b> I have written an accessible book that reveals the stages of development and their bridges to later learning. I have partnered with Megan Pate Photography to capture each stage beautifully and the book is full of imagery, simple theory and easy tips to help babies do their important work! Author and child development expert Carla Hannford says of the book, </p>
<p>       <i> ""Stephanie, with her bottom up approach, has elegantly presented current research from developmental experts on what assures whole brain development and learning success throughout life, starting from the very beginning.""</i></p>
<p><b>2. For daycare providers </b>I have created a certificate program that trains daycare providers on how to best facilitate optimal brain development in their setting. So often when I work with new parents they worry they will not be able to find childcare that offers a bottom up experience for their baby. Since most American babies are cared for by daycare providers or nannies, it is important for families to have a resource in which to find care providers that understand the role of unrestricted movement in brain development. Certified providers will become part of our database directory so new parents can easily find Baby Bare Certified care for their babies. </p>
<p><b>3. For early education teachers, advocates, administrators </b>I have created curriculum kits that give educators everything needed to share our bottom up approach with the families they serve. After doing staff trainings for educators I often get stopped by teachers wanting to know where they can get my photos or brain model that I use to teach the concepts. It became very clear that teachers need more than a 2-hour introduction to this work; they want to feel confident in teaching it to the families they serve. The curriculum kits come with everything they need to do just that!</p>

The risks that Baby Bare faces

One risk we face as a grassroots movement is our voice not getting heard in a climate where parents are being bombarded by all the things they need to do and buy to be a good parent. We have partnered with experts in the field that support our movement and are willing to use their platform to share what they agree is a very important and missing piece of our collective understanding of child development. Our three-part market of parents, educators and daycare providers was designed especially to make a broad impact and create a community of ""bottom uppers"" so parents are not navigating this new approach on their own but rather have a community of educators and care providers who are learning alongside of them and can support their efforts as parents to provide a bottom up childhood for their babies!

<p>The START Program. Established August 2014, we are a nonprofit organization who strives to provide a safe, structured afterschool learning environment where students can develop the character and academic skills necessary for lifelong success. We offer a plethora of diverse services to the community which includes, (1) Writing Assistance for High School and College Students (2) Health &amp; Fitness Workshops and Training and (3) Assistance with College Preparation. We work with select students each week who demonstrate the need for diversification in the academic, social, and health and fitness process. We wish to cultivate the whole child. We have identified 3 criterions in which to provide support: [1] Environmental Responsibilities: Self &amp; Community [2] Goal Attainment: Workforce Preparation &amp; Career Development [3] Health &amp; Fitness: Mind &amp; Body. </p>

</div></div>","When the first black residents of South Florida arrived in the 1880s from the Bahamas to work at the Peacock Inn on Biscayne Bay, they established West Coconut Grove, Florida. By the early 1900s the neighborhood was thriving.  Today, due to many years of decline and lack of investment, our beloved community is in disrepair and the residents, including our youth are struggling as re-gentrification looms.   We have a strong desire to cultivate the whole child. Thus, as Educators born and reared in West Coconut Grove (Florida), we submit this campaign on behalf of The  Striving To Attain Remarkable Teens Program (The START Program). We are passionate about helping to cultivate the youth of our community, As adolescents, six of the seven facilitators were provided with the opportunity to participate in a youth servicing program geared towards college readiness.  Due to this experience, we have recognized the importance to instill, expose, and further develop an understanding of the following within our youth:

-Character Building-College Readiness-Community Service-Continual Knowledge-Environmental Responsibilities-Financial Literacy -Goal Attainment-Health & Fitness-Independence-Inter-dependency-Networking-Time-managementWe understand as part of our efforts to create an initiative that best supports the youth of the community in which we serve, we seek to extend our services to include a START Lab. The START Lab is our “Community Resource Initiative” in which we have strategically planned to offer the disadvantaged youth of the community with opportunities to learn & access technology that drastically reduce the achievement gap crisis. Our facility will be outfitted with a plethora of technology daily, which would help aid in the effort to foster academic growth among the youth in the area. This is in direct relation to Miami-Dade County Public Schools Digital Convergence Plan: An initiative ""to close the digital divide...[this] transformation will not only provide greater digital content in mobile technologies, but will help create a new culture of learning by promoting blended learning environments & increasing 21st century learning opportunities."" In addition, it ""will aid in developing independent, self-initiated learners; provide for collaboration & communication between students & teachers; and extend student learning beyond the classroom.""
What We Need & What You GetAccording to a recent study, only 56% of residents owned a computer, 28% owned a printer and 51% of these residents had access to the internet (Village West Community Needs Assessment Survey Responses, 2013). Of the households surveyed, approximately 37% of the parents are unemployed or underemployed.  Often times, parents are unable to provide the proper resources in order to properly nourish and meet their child’s academic needs. 

We wish to provide our Community Resource Initiative with approximately 40 laptops/tablets, 2 desktops, 2 color printers/scanners, 1 SMART television, and 1 Promethean/SMART Board among a number of miscellaneous items required to assist in the effective function of this initiative. This will help aid in the effort to offer support to those students who do not have access to technology, thus increasing their prospects of bettering their grades in school. Our site has two State Certified Instructors certified in Exceptional Student Education, Mathematics, Accounting, Reading K12 and Middle Grades English Language Arts and one county certified instructor who specializes in Reading Intervention.

<b><br/>FATCUT
 UPCYCLING</b> is a collaborative network of more than 20 persons that 
experiments, creates and trash-forms seemingly useless objects (garbage) 
in order to give them greater sustainability and re-purpose them into 
useful products and educational toys (<b>upcycling*</b>). It is also a 
laboratory workshop  of ideas and know-how freely available to everyone,
 giving solutions to everyday needs.<br/><p><br/>Cardboard,
 newspapers, plastic bags, pallets, soda caps, damaged water heaters and other 
“garbage”...everything is being processed in order to postpone its arrival to the dump or 
junkyard and to increase its span of life. It is a way to minimize the already oversized mass 
of garbage and reduce the energy cost of consumption.
 It is an alternative to the traditional recycling of materials, which
is not CO2 efficient and which involves the huge cost of blue bins and the lack of state management.<br/><br/><b><a href=""Fat%20Cut%20Upcycling"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FatCut UPCYCLING</a></b>

<b>WHAT IS UPCYCLING?</b><br/><br/>The main idea of upcycling 
is <b>to reuse discarded materials</b> and make them useful again and give them <b>a
 new identity and ecological value</b>. As a consequence, upcycling helps to reduce the 
consumption of new raw materials in order to manufacture new products. To
 reduce consumption leads to a reduction of the 
required energy wasted for their construction. <b>By upcycling, we minimize the contamination of air, groundwater and the emissions of greenhouse gases.<br/><br/></b><ul><li>
<b>Downcycling</b> refers to processing materials and products into new materials of inferior quality.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Upcycling</b>
 on the contrary, uses the entire product, in order to either make it 
useful again or give it a new identity and value.</li></ul>

<b>OUR UPCYCLED PLAYGROUND</b><br/><br/>Our space <b>'CADO PARADISO' </b>('Trashcan Paradise') is <b>dedicated to play-based learning</b>. It has been constructed entirely
 <b>DIT (do-it-together)</b> by our team and is based in a <b>240 m2</b> old factory in Athens, Greece.<br/><br/>It’s
 <b>90% UPCYCLED</b>. Flying automatic dragons, castles and trampolines made 
from tires, huge plastic bottle puzzles, PVC tube slides, trash-formed
 bicycle games, optical toys and marble run walls are, among others, the scenery that aims to trigger the 
fantasy of the visitor. A series of workshops including DIY toys, 
arts &amp; crafts for children, geography, physics, biology games are 
introduced to the kids while and through playing.<b><br/></b><br/>The
 play and therefore the child are not spared from the collective fantasy
 of perpetual growth, where <b>'space-time' for free creative happiness</b> 
does not fit in nor is part of one’s daily busy schedule. One’s career

<b>ΤΙ ΕΙΝΑΙ ΤΟ UPCYCLING?</b><br/><br/>Η κυρίαρχη ιδέα του upcycling είναι <b>η επανάχρηση πεταμένων υλικών</b> ώστε να ξαναγίνουν χρήσιμα και <b>να αποκτήσουν μια νέα ταυτότητα και οικολογική αξία</b>. Σα συνέπεια, το upcycling βοηθάει στην μείωση της κατανάλωσης νέων πρώτων υλών και στη μείωση της απαιτούμενης ενέργειας που σπαταλιέται  για την κατασκευή νέων προϊόντων. <b>H άμεση ανακύκλωση είναι ένας καλός τρόπος να βοηθήσουμε την ελαχιστοποίηση της ατμοσφαιρικής μόλυνσης, της μόλυνσης των υδάτων και των εκπομπών του θερμοκηπίου.</b><br/>
<p><br/></p>
<ul><li>Το <b>Downcycling</b> είναι η συμβατική ανακύκλωση, δηλαδή η διαδικασία 
μεταποίησης υλών και 
προϊόντων σε νέα υλικά κατώτερης ποιότητας, αυξάνοντας ταυτόχρονα τις 
εργοστασιακές εκπομπες διοξειδίου του άνθρακα (CO2) στην ατμόσφαιρα.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Το <b>Upcycling</b>, αντίθετα, 
χρησιμοποιεί εξ'ολοκλήρου το προϊόν, είτε καθιστώντας το εκ νέου 
χρήσιμο, είτε προσδίδοντάς του νέα ιδιότητα και αξία, μειώνοντας το 
ενεργειακό κόστος και τις εκπομπές ρύπων και αυξάνοντας την 
εφευρετικότητα και τη δημιουργικότητα του ανθρώπου.<br/><br/>

Κατασκευάστηκε αποκλειστικά από μέλη της ομάδας μας σε μια διαδικασία <b>D.I.T (do-it-together)</b>.
 Πρόκειται για έναν χώρο 240τ.μ., στην οδό Εριγόνης 3, στα Κάτω Πετράλωνα
 της Αθήνας, που φιλοξενεί παιδιά όλων των ηλικιών, 
προκειμένου να παίξουν, να απασχοληθούν δημιουργικά και να εκπαιδευτούν 
σε τεχνικές κατασκευής upcycled παιχνιδιών και χρηστικών αντικειμένων.<br/><br/>Ο παιχνιδοχώρος <b>""ΚΑΔΟ ΠΑΡΑΝΤΙΣΟ"" είναι κατα 90% κατασκευασμένος από ανακυκλωμένα υλικά</b>. Ιπτάμενοι δράκοι, τεράστια πάζλ από 
πλαστικά μπουκάλια, μεταποιημένα παιχνίδια με ποδήλατα, μουσικά 
παιχνίδια και τσουλήθρες απο σωλήνες pvc, κάστρα και τραμπολίνο απο 
ρόδες αυτοκινήτων και πολλά άλλα θα συνθέσουν μια φαντασμαγορία για τις 5
 αισθήσεις παιδιών και μεγάλων.
Στον χώρο λαμβάνουν μέρος μια σειρά εργαστηρίων δημιουργικής 
απασχόλησης όπου η γνώση θα προκύπτει πάντα μέσα απο την χαρά του 
παιχνιδιού. Τα εργαστήρια περιλαμβάνουν κατασκευές παιχνιδιών, κουκλοθέατρο, μουσική, εικαστικά, χοροθέατρο, φυσική, βιολογία, γεωγραφία, βοτανολογία, πολιτική αγωγή.<br/><br/>Το παιχνίδι και συνεπώς το παιδί δε γλίτωσαν απ' τη συλλογική φαντασίωση

 UPCYCLING is a collaborative network of more than 20 persons that 
experiments, creates and trash-forms seemingly useless objects (garbage) 
in order to give them greater sustainability and re-purpose them into 
useful products and educational toys (upcycling*). It is also a 
laboratory workshop  of ideas and know-how freely available to everyone,
 giving solutions to everyday needs.Cardboard,
 newspapers, plastic bags, pallets, soda caps, damaged water heaters and other 
“garbage”...everything is being processed in order to postpone its arrival to the dump or 
junkyard and to increase its span of life. It is a way to minimize the already oversized mass 
of garbage and reduce the energy cost of consumption.
 It is an alternative to the traditional recycling of materials, which
is not CO2 efficient and which involves the huge cost of blue bins and the lack of state management.FatCut UPCYCLING
 was founded 5 years ago.

During these years we have set up ""CADO PARADISO"" (Trashcan Paradise), the first upcycled playground in Athens (Greece), where we are currently based
We have published the #1 
issue of ""The TRASHFORMERS"" comic series in order to pass the message of upcycling through the visual culture of comics. We are currently illustrating the #2 issue to be published in April 2016.
We have participated in upcycling exhibitions, touring the Mediterranean 
Sea with an upcycled sailing boat ""MYSTIC BLUE"" EcoSailing & Diving.

We are organizing several Upcycling Workshops to educate people
 of all ages how to build ecological stoves out of used heaters, how to make glasses
 out of beer bottles and educational toys out of plastic cups etc.


WHAT IS UPCYCLING?The main idea of upcycling 
is to reuse discarded materials and make them useful again and give them a
 new identity and ecological value. As a consequence, upcycling helps to reduce the 
consumption of new raw materials in order to manufacture new products. To
 reduce consumption leads to a reduction of the 
required energy wasted for their construction. By upcycling, we minimize the contamination of air, groundwater and the emissions of greenhouse gases.
Downcycling refers to processing materials and products into new materials of inferior quality.

Upcycling
 on the contrary, uses the entire product, in order to either make it 
useful again or give it a new identity and value.

OUR UPCYCLED PLAYGROUNDOur space 'CADO PARADISO' ('Trashcan Paradise') is dedicated to play-based learning. It has been constructed entirely
 DIT (do-it-together) by our team and is based in a 240 m2 old factory in Athens, Greece.It’s
 90% UPCYCLED. Flying automatic dragons, castles and trampolines made 
from tires, huge plastic bottle puzzles, PVC tube slides, trash-formed
 bicycle games, optical toys and marble run walls are, among others, the scenery that aims to trigger the 
fantasy of the visitor. A series of workshops including DIY toys, 
arts & crafts for children, geography, physics, biology games are 
introduced to the kids while and through playing.The
 play and therefore the child are not spared from the collective fantasy
 of perpetual growth, where 'space-time' for free creative happiness 
does not fit in nor is part of one’s daily busy schedule. One’s career 
starts early enough so as to ensure, more and more, the lack of 
imagination in the game and later in life. Although
 the industrialization of the 'play' and the 'lamination' of toys is 
something relatively recent, the times when children had their time and 
space to create their own games, seems something distant, long gone and forgotten. We want to break contemporary parents' motto: 'I don’t have 
time, you don’t have time, let’s buy it'. We aim to introduce an educational space-time that will cultivate 
solidarity, respect towards diversity, participation in decision making 
and autonomy. The joy of learning cannot be scored! 
OUR WORKSHOPS SPACEOne floor above our upcycled playground we have set up FatCut Upcycling workshops space. It is here that we construct the toys for our playground and where our Upcycling workshops are taking place every week. For the time being, it is equipped with:
a carpenter's room for re-purposing wood to toys and wooden constructions
tools for upcycling metal scrap
tools for upcycling bottles into glass products
2 sewing machines for the making of dolls for kids
a metal press to upcycle waste paper into briquettes
storage tubes for plastic & paper
warehouse to store collected items

επανοικειοποίηση πρώτων υλών που πετιούνται. Στα εργαστήρια αυτά 
ασχοληθήκαμε με τη κατασκευή οικολογικών σομπών, ποτηριών, πρεσών για μπρικέτες και εκπαιδευτικών παιχνιδιών μεταξύ πολλών άλλων.



ΤΙ ΕΙΝΑΙ ΤΟ UPCYCLING?Η κυρίαρχη ιδέα του upcycling είναι η επανάχρηση πεταμένων υλικών ώστε να ξαναγίνουν χρήσιμα και να αποκτήσουν μια νέα ταυτότητα και οικολογική αξία. Σα συνέπεια, το upcycling βοηθάει στην μείωση της κατανάλωσης νέων πρώτων υλών και στη μείωση της απαιτούμενης ενέργειας που σπαταλιέται  για την κατασκευή νέων προϊόντων. H άμεση ανακύκλωση είναι ένας καλός τρόπος να βοηθήσουμε την ελαχιστοποίηση της ατμοσφαιρικής μόλυνσης, της μόλυνσης των υδάτων και των εκπομπών του θερμοκηπίου.

Το Downcycling είναι η συμβατική ανακύκλωση, δηλαδή η διαδικασία 
μεταποίησης υλών και 
προϊόντων σε νέα υλικά κατώτερης ποιότητας, αυξάνοντας ταυτόχρονα τις 
εργοστασιακές εκπομπες διοξειδίου του άνθρακα (CO2) στην ατμόσφαιρα.
Το Upcycling, αντίθετα, 
χρησιμοποιεί εξ'ολοκλήρου το προϊόν, είτε καθιστώντας το εκ νέου 
χρήσιμο, είτε προσδίδοντάς του νέα ιδιότητα και αξία, μειώνοντας το 
ενεργειακό κόστος και τις εκπομπές ρύπων και αυξάνοντας την 
εφευρετικότητα και τη δημιουργικότητα του ανθρώπου.

 ΤΟ ΚΑΔΟ ΠΑΡΑΝΤΙΣΟΟ χώρος μας ονομάζεται ""ΚΑΔΟ ΠΑΡΑΝΤΙΣΟ"" και είναι αφιερωμένος στη μάθηση μέσω του παιχνιδιού. Κατασκευάστηκε αποκλειστικά από μέλη της ομάδας μας σε μια διαδικασία D.I.T (do-it-together).
 Πρόκειται για έναν χώρο 240τ.μ., στην οδό Εριγόνης 3, στα Κάτω Πετράλωνα
 της Αθήνας, που φιλοξενεί παιδιά όλων των ηλικιών, 
προκειμένου να παίξουν, να απασχοληθούν δημιουργικά και να εκπαιδευτούν 
σε τεχνικές κατασκευής upcycled παιχνιδιών και χρηστικών αντικειμένων.Ο παιχνιδοχώρος ""ΚΑΔΟ ΠΑΡΑΝΤΙΣΟ"" είναι κατα 90% κατασκευασμένος από ανακυκλωμένα υλικά. Ιπτάμενοι δράκοι, τεράστια πάζλ από 
πλαστικά μπουκάλια, μεταποιημένα παιχνίδια με ποδήλατα, μουσικά 
παιχνίδια και τσουλήθρες απο σωλήνες pvc, κάστρα και τραμπολίνο απο 
ρόδες αυτοκινήτων και πολλά άλλα θα συνθέσουν μια φαντασμαγορία για τις 5
 αισθήσεις παιδιών και μεγάλων.
Στον χώρο λαμβάνουν μέρος μια σειρά εργαστηρίων δημιουργικής 
απασχόλησης όπου η γνώση θα προκύπτει πάντα μέσα απο την χαρά του 
παιχνιδιού. Τα εργαστήρια περιλαμβάνουν κατασκευές παιχνιδιών, κουκλοθέατρο, μουσική, εικαστικά, χοροθέατρο, φυσική, βιολογία, γεωγραφία, βοτανολογία, πολιτική αγωγή.Το παιχνίδι και συνεπώς το παιδί δε γλίτωσαν απ' τη συλλογική φαντασίωση
 της αέναης ανάπτυξης, όπου ο χωρο-χρόνος της ελεύθερης δημιουργικής 
ευτυχίας δε χωράει, ούτε είναι μέρος του καθημερινού ασφυκτικού 
προγράμματος. Η ""καριέρα"" ξεκινάει νωρίς ώστε να εξασφαλίζεται η ολοένα 
και περισσότερη απουσία φαντασίας στο παιχνίδι και μετέπειτα στη ζωή.Παρόλο που η «πλαστικοποίηση» και η εκβιομηχάνιση του παιχνιδιού είναι 
κάτι σχετικά πρόσφατο, η περίοδος όπου τα παιδιά είχαν το χωρο-χρόνο 
τους για να δημιουργούν τα παιχνίδια τους, φαίνεται κομμάτι κάποιου απροσδιόριστου μακρινού 
παρελθόντος. Θελουμε να ""σπάσουμε"" τη λογική ""δεν προλαβαίνω, δεν 
προλαβαίνεις, ας το αγοράσουμε..."". Θέλουμε να αναβιώσουμε εναν χώρο εκπαίδευσης που θα καλλιεργεί την 
αλληλεγγύη, τον σεβασμό στη διαφορετικότητα, την οικονομία με την 
πρωταρχική της σημασία, τη συμμετοχή και την αυτονομία. Η χαρά για τη γνώση δεν βαθμολογείται!
Ο ΧΩΡΟΣ ΕΡΓΑΣΤΗΡΙΩΝ UPCYCLINGΣτον 1ο όροφο πάνω από το ΚΑΔΟ ΠΑΡΑΝΤΙΣΟ εγκαταστήσαμε το χώρο εργαστηρίων μας. Εδώ κατασκευάζουμε τα παιχνίδια του παιχνιδοχώρου και οργανώνουμε σε εβδομαδιαία βάση τα εργαστήρια upcycling για ενήλικες. Ο χώρος είναι εξοπλισμένος με:
ξυλουργείο για τη μεταποίηση ξυλείας σε παιχνίδια και χρηστικά αντικείμενα


εργαλεία ανακύκλωσης μεταλλικών αντικειμένων

εργαλεία ανακύκλωσης γυάλινων μπουκαλιών σε χρηστικά αντικείμενα

2 ραπτομηχανές για την κατασκευή παιδικής κούκλας και άλλων αντικειμένων

μια μεταλλική πρέσσα για την κατασκευή μπρικέτας από χαρτί


αποθηκευτικοί χώροι για πλαστικό, χαρτί, κουτιά αλουμινίου


αποθήκη για τα πεταμένα αντικείμενα.

<p>When rape survivors seek medical care after their assault, most are alone
and uninformed about the basic services they require in order to <b>prevent HIV, pregnancy and
sexually-transmitted infections</b>.</p>
<p>In many places around the world, medical staff may also be unaware of the
specific services that survivors need or they may even be hostile to rape
survivors because of cultural attitudes. Even if a survivor is brave enough to
show up, she* might not get antibiotics, antiretrovirals or Plan B. Sometimes she* <b>may even be denied care and asked to
leave</b>. All of this can increase the risk of a rape survivor developing <b>PTSD, anxiety or depression</b>. </p>
<p>* (We use “she” here, because women are the most common survivors, but
it’s important to point out that rape survivors can be any gender and come from
any background.)</p>
<p>In some richer countries, rape crisis centers train and organize
networks of volunteer <b>rape crisis
counselors</b> to accompany and <b>advocate

A growing body of <a href=""http://codeinnovation.com/some-research-on-the-efficacy-of-rape-crisis-counseling/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">research</a> shows that these services have a significant effect on long-term recovery.</p>

<p>All over the world, rape survivors and their communities are

<p>We need to create a real resource that takes the knowledge gained from
decades of advocacy at rape crisis centers and put it in the hands of every
single person who needs it. </p>
<p>This isn’t counseling, or medical assistance. It’s simple advocacy:
information and support for the crucial visit to the hospital where rape
survivors get the life-saving care they need to begin recovery.</p>
<p>We’re keeping the app focused only on this important moment, because getting
medical care is an early moment when a survivor needs care and support and
because the protocol doesn’t change, no matter where in the world a survivor
lives. </p>
<p>We hope this resource encourages people to establish rape crisis
counselors around the world and that it will help to create a network of
healing that extends far beyond the app itself. Our partners in U.S. rape
crisis centers are already eager to share their resources and to support
volunteers who self-organize and seek to provide more formal services for rape
survivors in other countries.</p>

</h4>
<p>Intimate partner violence makes up 15% of all reported crime in the
U.S. [URL] and domestic violence is a major issue in every country. Often, rape
crisis counselors also serve as advocates for survivors of intimate partner
violence when they seek medical care, and this component is something we would
partner to build out if we raise additional funds.</p><p><br/></p>
<h4>
<b>2. 
</b><b>$62,500:</b><b> Intimate
Partner Violence Advocacy Module &amp; Digital Resources for Extended Survivor
Support and Community Advocacy</b>
</h4>
<p>This section would help survivors locate additional resources for
psychological support and services, by walking them through the process of how
to identify quality resources and how to reach out for expert support when it
is available. (Please note that we would not create a directory of, or a link
to services, because we do not have the resources to evaluate and keep this
list active.) Advocacy resources would also include how to self-organize a rape
survivor support group, a volunteer network or a crisis hotline. The content
would be provided by our partner rape crisis centers and adapted by our global coalition.

<p>Elie wrote an article last summer, <a href=""http://www.expatbackup.com/2015/07/shifting-the-silence-around-rape-and-sexual-assault-in-aid-culture/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Shifting the Silence around Rape and Sexual Assault in Aid Culture,”</a> that sparked emails from rape
survivors around the world who identified a need for an advocacy resource that
would help them to negotiate receiving appropriate medical care. This is where
the idea for digitizing the training program of rape crisis counselors originated.</p>
<p>To validate the idea, we reached out to dozens of rape
crisis centers in the US, the global network of women’s rights activists and
non-profits at Women Living under Muslim Laws, and support groups for
humanitarian aid workers, as well as gender-based violence experts. </p>
<p>All of the rape crisis centers who responded were supportive
of the idea of creating a digitized mobile version of rape crisis counselor
training and adapting it be be used as stand alone training materials and also
as an in-hand resource for survivors and their advocates in health centers. </p>
<p>Over a dozen women’s rights activists and non-profits around
the world wrote back to offer to join our coalition and support the project. In
addition, many of the aid workers and gender-based violence experts we reached
out to also offered their guidance and support for the project.</p>
<p>Over 100 people and groups we reached out to were unanimous
in their support of the app as a tool to help survivors, their advocates and
would-be volunteers to help facilitate getting rape survivors the medical care
they need.</p>
<p>There is not yet an appropriate app of this kind to be found
on the App store or the Google Play store. While one resource created for the
U.S. military is professionally done, most of the apps in our category are
inappropriate and are not optimized by experts for use by rape survivors around
the world.</p><p><br/></p>
<h4>
<b>2.  </b><b>Will this app provide formal certification
for rape crisis counselors?</b>
</h4>
<p>No, it will not. Formal rape crisis counselor certification
is available only through accredited rape crisis centers after what is usually
a 40-hour in-person training. Our resource is for educational purposes only and
does not confer any titles or privileges associated with such titles. Our legal
disclaimer and introductory content will make very clear that the app content
does not make anyone a certified rape crisis counselor and is to be used for
informational purposes and at the user’s full discretion. We hope it will
encourage people to seek formal training and to support rape crisis counseling
centers. But the app itself is for reference only.</p><p><br/></p>
<h4>
<b>3.  </b><b>Why
make an app and not a mobile-ready website?</b>
</h4>
<p>Apps work
without active data or Internet connectivity, whereas websites do not. In
addition, we are creating a mobile learning user interface that helps our
different users (survivors, advocates or would-be volunteers) through the
content sequentially and that branches into different decision trees as needed.
This kind of user experience is better suited to a mobile app. </p><p><br/></p>
<h4>
<b>4.  </b><b>Will the app offer medical assistance or
advice?</b>
</h4>
<p>No, it will
not. Qualified medical personnel at the health center where the survivor is
seeking care are the ones to provide medical assistance. The app is focused on
offering psychological support and advocacy within the medical system, and it
will not contain any medical information aside from a reference to the healthcare protocol for sexual assault. The app is also not
diagnostic in any way.</p><p><br/></p>
<h4>
<b>5.  </b><b>How
will the app function in low bandwidth contexts where Internet service is poor?</b>
</h4>
<p>We will limit
the download size by restricting the app content to mostly text and ensure that
no Internet or data service is necessary for the app to function. Once the app
is downloaded, it will not require connectivity to function.</p><p><br/></p>
<h4>
<b>6.  </b><b>Will
having this app on a smartphone identify someone as a rape survivor? Could its
visibility cause problems to the people who have it?</b>
</h4><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Although it can
be used as a tool for survivors and their advocates, the app is primarily a
training resource for volunteer rape crisis counselors in their communities. It’s
title and visual identity will be training-focused for volunteers and not cue
or identify the user as a rape survivor.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<h4>
<b>7.  </b><b>How
will people who don’t own a smartphone be able to access the content?</b>
</h4>
<p>We are creating a mobile resource for people with access to
smartphones because the number of smartphone users around the world is rapidly
increasing as the cost of handsets and mobile connectivity drops. While mobile
penetration will never reach 100% of the global population, smartphone owners
are influencers in their communities. </p>
<p>We faced a similar challenge when Code created our <a href=""http://codeinnovation.com/2014/04/press-release-free-about-ebola-mobile-app-targets-smart-phone-users-in-african-languages/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“About Ebola” mobile app</a> in early 2014 and it was downloaded over 12,000 times, mostly
by users in West Africa. While not everyone in West Africa had a smartphone, we
designed the resource to be used one-to-many, which means that one person with
access to the content could use the tool to train or teach others. In this way,
the content can still benefit people without their own smartphone.</p><p><br/></p>
<h4>
<b>8.  </b><b>Could this app be used by predators?</b>
</h4>
<p>Our app will not collect identifying data from its users,
but smartphone use in general carries with it definite risks that are not
specific to the app and that need to be carefully considered. For instance, any
smartphone can show its location and share sensitive information with predators
who have the digital sophistication to access this data. But running our app
will not create additional avenues for predators to access vulnerable people. </p><p><br/></p>
<h4>
<b>9.  </b><b>Rape survivors face different challenges in
different contexts. Are you going to make regional versions?</b>
</h4>
<p>There will be one version of the app that can toggle to
different languages. While in the future, we may create regional content if our
partners identify the need for this, our initial build will focus on creating a
single resource that fits most cultural and health system contexts. This is why
our partners’ expertise is so important, because their knowledge of their own
cultural issues and health system challenges will help to ensure that the
resource is more appropriate for a wide user base, wherever they may be.
Naturally, there will be subtle differences in language because of cultural
differences in referring to this sort of violence; but the core content will be
consistent.</p><p><br/></p>
<h4>
<b>10.  </b><b>Is there already something like this on the
app store?</b>
</h4>
<p>Dozens of apps already on Google Play and the App Store that present
themselves as tools in the fight against sexual violence are inappropriate at
best and harmful at worst. Many, you’re meant to download and activate if and
when you get raped, pressing a button to alert your friends and family that
this is happening to you. </p><p><br/></p>
<h4>
<b>11.  </b><b>What other languages will you translate the
app into?</b>
</h4>
<p>For now, we have partner organizations willing to translate
the content into Arabic, Farsi, French and Spanish, and we would love to
include more. If you sign up to support our Ambassador perk, you will support the app
to be translated into the language of your choice, which is something we hope
will happen!</p>

</div></div>","Worldwide, one in five women will be raped in her lifetime. That’s over 700 million women and girls.
There’s a global epidemic of sexual violence with women at the frontlines.When Seeking Medical Care, Rape Survivors often Lack Advocates and Support 
When rape survivors seek medical care after their assault, most are alone
and uninformed about the basic services they require in order to prevent HIV, pregnancy and
sexually-transmitted infections.
In many places around the world, medical staff may also be unaware of the
specific services that survivors need or they may even be hostile to rape
survivors because of cultural attitudes. Even if a survivor is brave enough to
show up, she* might not get antibiotics, antiretrovirals or Plan B. Sometimes she* may even be denied care and asked to
leave. All of this can increase the risk of a rape survivor developing PTSD, anxiety or depression. 
* (We use “she” here, because women are the most common survivors, but
it’s important to point out that rape survivors can be any gender and come from
any background.)
In some richer countries, rape crisis centers train and organize
networks of volunteer rape crisis
counselors to accompany and advocate
for rape survivors when they come into the emergency room. A growing body of research shows that these services have a significant effect on long-term recovery.
But in most places, the resources to train rape crisis counselors aren’t
available. And survivors and their advocates lack access to guidance on how to ensure that a survivor receives
the care she needs.
Our Global
Coalition of Experts Who Care
I’m Elie Calhoun, a rape crisis counselor, and aid worker and a public
health expert at Code Innovation, where we take solutions to problems
like this one and digitize them so they can scale. 
We’ve worked in Africa and on technology projects for over a decade, connecting
people in hard-to-reach environments with education that empowers them to make a difference in their own lives and in their communities.
Now we’re reaching out to bring rape crisis counselor training to
everyone who has access to a smartphone. Every year, the affordability of mobile phones and
the availability of data is rising. 
We’ve brought rape crisis centers around the U.S., including the DC Rape Crisis Center (the oldest in the US) and the Pittsburgh Action against Rape coalition, together with humanitarian,
gender-based violence experts, mobile learning specialists, women’s rights
defenders and non-profits from around the world to make this happen.
A Rape
Crisis Counseling App Available to All
Our Rape Crisis Counseling app will be a mobile version of the
training that rape crisis centers provide for their volunteers. This training
will be adapted for a range of different health care settings and cultural
contexts. It will:


Allow anyone, anywhere to train herself as an
informal rape crisis counselor who can help rape survivors in her network or
community;


Be an in-hand resource that helps friends,
colleagues and family members know what to do when they accompany a survivor to
get medical care;


Support a survivor who has to seek medical care on
her own  to negotiate asking for and
getting the health services she needs;


Include resources for LGBTQIA survivors and
their advocates, as well information on how to advocate for children and people
with disabilities.


We’re betting that smartphones will be in the hands of almost everyone
before too long – which means that the resources to begin healing after sexual
assault have the potential to reach anyone, anywhere. 
Mobile
Training Resources for Would-Be Volunteers
All over the world, rape survivors and their communities are
responding to the aftermath of sexual violence without access to the full range
of information that could help them in their process.
We need to create a real resource that takes the knowledge gained from
decades of advocacy at rape crisis centers and put it in the hands of every
single person who needs it. 
This isn’t counseling, or medical assistance. It’s simple advocacy:
information and support for the crucial visit to the hospital where rape
survivors get the life-saving care they need to begin recovery.
We’re keeping the app focused only on this important moment, because getting
medical care is an early moment when a survivor needs care and support and
because the protocol doesn’t change, no matter where in the world a survivor
lives. 
We hope this resource encourages people to establish rape crisis
counselors around the world and that it will help to create a network of
healing that extends far beyond the app itself. Our partners in U.S. rape
crisis centers are already eager to share their resources and to support
volunteers who self-organize and seek to provide more formal services for rape
survivors in other countries.

Join Us  
Rape makes even the strongest among us feel powerless, but together we
can take a stand so that survivors can access the information they need to take
a first step towards healing.
Join us on the journey to create this much-needed resource. We’ll be
sending project updates and stories every step of the way.We have two Stretch Goals that we’d love to see happen if we get more
than we’re asking for:
1. 
$37,500: Intimate
Partner Violence Advocacy and Support Module

Intimate partner violence makes up 15% of all reported crime in the
U.S. [URL] and domestic violence is a major issue in every country. Often, rape
crisis counselors also serve as advocates for survivors of intimate partner
violence when they seek medical care, and this component is something we would
partner to build out if we raise additional funds.

2. 
$62,500: Intimate
Partner Violence Advocacy Module & Digital Resources for Extended Survivor
Support and Community Advocacy

This section would help survivors locate additional resources for
psychological support and services, by walking them through the process of how
to identify quality resources and how to reach out for expert support when it
is available. (Please note that we would not create a directory of, or a link
to services, because we do not have the resources to evaluate and keep this
list active.) Advocacy resources would also include how to self-organize a rape
survivor support group, a volunteer network or a crisis hotline. The content
would be provided by our partner rape crisis centers and adapted by our global coalition.

Our goal 
 Irembo Foundation is established with the aim of breaking the vicious cycle of poverty, tackling the obstacles that restrict the freedom of vulnerable families in Kigali. Because we believe that, if empowered, anybody can be agent of change in their own life.
We want to ensure that every child has access to education and the self-sufficiency of the
families en Kacyiru district and surroundings (Kigali, Rwanda) through: 


1. a vocational training program (sewing and shoemaking) for the parents of the families in a vulnerable situation and the opening of Irembo
Boutique, the shop where these products with a unique African touch and produced by these families will be sold.  
2. a volunteer program for youth to engage in activities with a positive social impact and the
empowerment of women through a single women’s club. 






What we need 
 What do we need this 5,000 EUR for?  Sewing machines: we aim to purchase at least 13 sewing machines for a group of 25 women. 
Rent of the place that will serve as workshop and Irembo Boutique. We need to cover 5 months of rent. We have estimated that after these 5 months, the rent will be paid with the profits obtained selling the products. 
House reforms. Materials: beautiful and good quality African fabrics, leather and paint to create our unique products. 
Tools: scissors, rulers, blackboards, tables, chairs...
Instructors: two professionals will be teaching these men and women and receiving a symbolic payment.    


The impact
 Collaborating with Irembo Foundation you won't just be making a simple donation, you will become the investor of a social enterprise that will change the lives of many people giving them the opportunity to take control of their own lives. We don't believe in charity, we look for long-lasting and efficient solutions to give these families the opportunities and freedom they deserve. 







After a 5 months training period, this project will become self-sufficient and profits will contribute to our employees salaries and the expansion and
development of new activities in the Youth
for Youth and Mama Rwanda Project. It will
also provide special assistance for those
families who still face problems paying for
school fees. 





Challenges   It might not be an easy task but we have made sure we have all the ingredients we need for a successful project:   
Market opportunity: increasing number of tourists visiting Rwanda with an interest in having a positive social impact with their visit.  
Human Centered Design Approach: our projects are created to suit the needs of the people we help.  

Trust: we have been working with families in this district for the last 2 years, proving our commitment and willingness to improve their lives. Our Irembo Foundation President in Rwanda, Bertrand Ishimwe has lived in this district his entire life.     Other ways you can help us  Post it, tweet it, share it!! If you know anybody who could be interested in helping a project like ours, let him/her know. And if you are interested in participating in the rest of activities we are carrying out in Kigali, visit our website and leave us a message: www.irembofoundation.org 
We also want to thank the people who have already collaborated with us in this campaign: Juan José Ocaña, Javier San José, Bibiana Gil, Sheila, Luís Javier Acedo, Luciano Lilloy, Marisa Martín, Ramón Marcebo, Daniel Risueño and Amadro Lorente :)



Nuestro objetivo 
Irembo Foundation ha sido creada con el objetivo de romper el círculo vicioso de la pobreza, abordando los obstáculos que restringen la libertad de las familias más vulnerables de Kigali. Porque nosotros creemos que todo el mundo, si se le da una oportunidad, puede ser agente de cambio de su propia vida.  
Queremos asegurar que todo los niños tienen acceso a la educación y la autosuficiencia de las familias del distrito de Kacyiru y alrededores mediante:  
1. un programa de formación profesional (costura y creación de zapatos) para los padres y madres de las familias en situación vulnerable, y la apertura de Irembo Boutique, la tienda donde se venderán estos productos con un toque africano único y producidos por estas familias. 
2. un programa de voluntariado para jóvenes donde llevarán a cabo actividades con un impacto social positivo y el empoderamiento de la mujer mediante un club para madres solteras.   

Lo que necesitamos

¿Para qué necesitamos estos 5,000 EUR?

Máquinas de coser: queremos comprar al menos 13 máquinas de coser para el grupo de 25 mujeres con el que estamos trabajando. 
El alquiler de un local que será nuestro taller y tienda Irembo Boutique. Necesitamos cubrir 5 meses de alquiler. Hemos estimado que después de estos 5 meses, se hará frente al alquiler gracias a los beneficios obtenidos mediante la venta de nuestros productos.  
Reformas del local. 
Materiales: bonitas telas africanas de la mejor calidad, cuero y pintura para crear nuestros productos únicos. 
Herramientas: tijeras, reglas, pizarras, mesas, sillas...
Instructores: dos profesionales estarán instruyendo a nuestro grupo de mujeres y hombres y recibiendo una paga simbólica.

Our mission at the Treehouse Project  is to empower humanity with sustainable holistic solutions.  Solutions that can be applied anywhere in the world to provide FOOD, CLEAN WATER, SHELTER, ENERGY, COMMUNITY, and ECONOMIC STABILITY. Our vision is to see people live ethically with the environment and each other.  

These Skills Include: Welding, Wood Working, Planting food, Designing Eco Communities, Health & Fitness, and more!



From Founder, Scott Bunn: ""Why I Got Into Sustainability""

""I am motivated by  whole system solutions to many of the challenges we face today including food/water scarcity, pollution, climate, and economics.  Human ingenuity can  reduce, eliminate, or comfortably  adapt to these challenges.Chelsea and I have devoted our lives to creating learning centers and programs until the ability to care for oneself  & their community is common knowledge. ""

Building + Growing Food + Team Building + Health  = Resilience

Understanding these solutions can be challenging, so we are creating the Treehouse Learning Center. This hands-on training facility is a half-acre permaculture demonstration of food, water shelter, energy, and community development. Treehouse Tools & Training is a educational program within the learning center focused on hands-on, skills and techniques for sustainability.  It is holistic applied learning model, giving students of all ages the opportunity to build community service projects while learning the skills to do so.
Some of the skills covered In TTT include:  construction, metal fabrication, health & fitness, food security, and reforestation.  The best experience is immersive, where students stay at the Treehouse Learnign Center in an Activated Peer Group
 True empowerment comes through experience-based education, and with education comes economic stability.""




 



Purpose for Funding 

1. Materials to finish the Treehouse Learning Center - the half acre permaculture demonstration so visitors and students will understand how to implement permanent improvements to culture in their own communities. 


Community Center: an outdoor pavilion with a kitchen, bathroom and garden roof.
Greenhouse: including an aquaponics demonstration, hands-on plant propagation, table-top demonstration of the Learning Center that shows how the rain and sun are harnessed to produce energy.
Yurt: installed next to the greenhouse as a living space for teachers and visitors
Natural Storefront to display products and services as well as several natural building methods
Energy Production: We want this entire site to produce more power than it uses!

Natural Swimming Pool, serving several functions:




    geothermal cooling for surrounding structures in the summer time


    food production via fish and water plants

    reflection pond for passive solar heating in the winter time

    rain water collection from the main house    


    key point irrigation pond to irrigate the rest of the property


    wet conveyance transportation system teaching element

    oh, and a swimming pool for the ever so important relaxation

What have we done so Far?               
About 30%!
- Obtained land from the neighboring trailer park
- Became Certified in Permaculture Design, and designed the Learning Center
- Developed a fruit Orchard, garden and two ponds
- Build a chicken area with 3 paddocks for rotational grazing
- Installed a reforestation project with Shubhendu Sharma
- Built an Earth Dome, used for a Sanctuary and Demonstration
- Developed Treehouse Tools & Training
- Created the Treehouse Tool Library
We have a good portion of materials and heavy machinery, and most importantly, a devoted team. But we’re asking you to help us raise $57K for the remaining materials needed to complete the Learning Center. 
Wait, that's not all we're doing this year!
We want to run at least 50 people through the monthly Treehouse Tools & Training program, which includes 20 meals + their room and utility expense - $102,350 
The cool part is that you can not only help fund the construction of the Learning Center BUT you and other participants can actually help us build it! Part of the TTT program is actually getting hands-on training through building the Center!
3. We need to cover startup, reward and campaign costs to ensure our success! ($52,000)
TOTAL FUNDING: $211,350

Recently Completed Projects

Energy upgrades to our home
Planted a fruit orchard
Planted a reforestation project
Installed two reflection ponds which function as a rain water holding spaces, food production, reflection ponds to assist in heating structures in the winter. 
Milled lumber using trees from our site
Recycled 6,000 bricks from Clemson University

Built a tiny house on wheels as a mobile teaching unit



GLOBAL IMPACTThis is a fascinating time in human history – it is crazy to think of how industry has changed the face of the planet. With an exponential population growth, we are all feeling the pressures of climate, pollution, and scarcity. We have to address these issues, and we have to start at the root of the problem.
We, here at the Seneca Treehouse Project, have a dream of permanent global lifestyle change through building sustainable communities and learning centers that implement and teach permaculture, construction, fabrication and ethical cohabitation with the environment and others. So far, over 1,000 people have visited the TTreehouse Project, leaving inspired and with the training necessary to make life change. As we launch our new training program, Treehouse Tools and Training, our goal is to train 50 new teachers every year who can teach 50 more and so on... That’s 6 million teachers by 2020!
We’ve done our research, we’ve built the framework, we’ve tested it in our own home (it works!). Now, it’s time to spread the wisdom, and we need you to be a part of it.

<p>Igneous Foundation is an organization

<p>The

<p>We
inspire to provide the joy of music and art to youth, empower those with an interest
in an artistic vocation, and create a new generation of artists.
Igneous Foundation

subsidize the necessary instruments, training and supplies of which an artist
could not readily afford.</p>
<p>Igneous Foundation
is dedicated to the
late Michael Evans Boyd III, who in preceding his passing, and despite his personal special needs challenges, dreamed of such a facility

<p><b>WHY CRIMINOLOGY </b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Like most kids, I dreamed of becoming a police officer. Unlike most kids, I started reading criminology and psychiatry manuals with pictures and detailed crime scene descriptions at the age of 10. But when I applied for university at the age of 17, I thought I didn't have the guts to make such a mentally challenging job my life. </p>
<b></b><p>I chickened out and picked the easy option: writing. I liked writing, and I figured that by studying journalism I could uncover crimes without being directly involved with them. Except that there was a thing I hadn't considered: social media. </p>
<p>Now <a href=""http://www.prweek.com/article/1369897/social-media-changing-face-journalism"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">everybody can break the news</a>. Crime is everywhere: from Twitter to Netflix, the success of <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2016/01/03/why-making-a-murderer-is-netflixs-most-significant-show-ever/#3fac740c5c00"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shows like Making a Murderer</a>, The Jinx or Serial means that talking about crime, filming it or analysing it is no longer a journalist's prerogative.</p>
<p><b>WHY I WANT TO STUDY CRIMINOLOGY NOW</b> </p>If it's easier to know when crimes are happening, now it's the why that we're going after. We want to know why miscarriages of justice happen, or what brings people like us to commit gruesome crimes. </div><div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The ""Eureka!"" moment came during the life-changing <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/scholarship-for-the-university-of-sydney/www.undergraduateawards.com/winners-of-the-undergraduate-awards-2015/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Undergraduate Awards Summit in 2015,</a> where I won an award in the Media and Journalism category thanks to my paper on how the most followed UK journalists on Twitter used the social network to comment on Margaret Thatcher's death. </p>
<p>During one of the panels, the incredibly inspiring Cyber-Psychologist <a href=""http://www.maryaiken.com/?page_id=4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dr Mary Aiken</a> said: “We are living through one of the largest unregulated social experiments of all time,” referring to violent social media content's impact on young minds.  </p>
<p>Because crime is so widely available online, for me reporting it and sharing it is no longer enough. I want to go and do something about it, because all of us, especially kids, are exposed to potentially harmful content online.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>WHY I'M RE-TRAINING</b></p>
<p>I've explored what makes people buy a product, read a story or buy into a campaign. Now I want to go to the dark side and explore the reasons behind crime.<b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></b></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">After grabbing all the opportunities the fast-paced London life offered me, I now feel confident enough to follow my dreams. Once I finish my master, I'd like to do a PhD looking at what connects crime, the media and the Internet.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>WHY AUSTRALIA</b></p>
<p>I've been living in London for nearly five years and I'm looking forward to a new challenge. <br/><br/>I've explored studying in the United States, but criminology MAs + PhDs in there can last <a href=""http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-humanities-schools/criminology-rankings"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">up to seven years</a> with equally expensive fees. Plus, Sydney Uni hosts the <a href=""http://sydney.edu.au/law/criminology/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sydney Institute of Criminology</a>, a hub of research I really want to be involved with. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">HOW MUCH</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Despite working hard and being nice to people for over four years in London, I haven't managed to save enough to go back to university.

<p><b>WHY I NEED YOUR HELP</b></p>
<p>Since I've never studied criminology before, it's hard for me to qualify for most course-specific scholarships. The Italian government doesn't offer student loans and neither does the Australian one. </p>
<p>With a small donation you can help me study my dream degree and take it further: after the MA, I would like to keep pursuing my criminology studies by earning a PhD, focusing on researching new, unexplored areas of cyber-crime and crime and the media. <br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T REACH MY GOAL?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>I've chosen Indiegogo's Flexible Funding option, which means I will still be able to save your contributions and use them towards my degree. Which means that you will still be entitled to all the perks your donation gives you the right to.</p>

<p>Although a nice craft cocktail or a pint is always very much appreciated, you would have my eternal gratitude - and one of the perks listed here - if you decided to fund my education instead of my passion for alcoholic drinks.</p>

Funding a one-year criminology master Help me re-train and pursue my life-long dream to study criminology at the University of Sydney. 
WHY CRIMINOLOGY 

Like most kids, I dreamed of becoming a police officer. Unlike most kids, I started reading criminology and psychiatry manuals with pictures and detailed crime scene descriptions at the age of 10. But when I applied for university at the age of 17, I thought I didn't have the guts to make such a mentally challenging job my life. 
I chickened out and picked the easy option: writing. I liked writing, and I figured that by studying journalism I could uncover crimes without being directly involved with them. Except that there was a thing I hadn't considered: social media. 
Now everybody can break the news. Crime is everywhere: from Twitter to Netflix, the success of shows like Making a Murderer, The Jinx or Serial means that talking about crime, filming it or analysing it is no longer a journalist's prerogative.
WHY I WANT TO STUDY CRIMINOLOGY NOW If it's easier to know when crimes are happening, now it's the why that we're going after. We want to know why miscarriages of justice happen, or what brings people like us to commit gruesome crimes. 

The ""Eureka!"" moment came during the life-changing Undergraduate Awards Summit in 2015, where I won an award in the Media and Journalism category thanks to my paper on how the most followed UK journalists on Twitter used the social network to comment on Margaret Thatcher's death. 
During one of the panels, the incredibly inspiring Cyber-Psychologist Dr Mary Aiken said: “We are living through one of the largest unregulated social experiments of all time,” referring to violent social media content's impact on young minds.  
Because crime is so widely available online, for me reporting it and sharing it is no longer enough. I want to go and do something about it, because all of us, especially kids, are exposed to potentially harmful content online.

WHY I'M RE-TRAINING
I've explored what makes people buy a product, read a story or buy into a campaign. Now I want to go to the dark side and explore the reasons behind crime.
After grabbing all the opportunities the fast-paced London life offered me, I now feel confident enough to follow my dreams. Once I finish my master, I'd like to do a PhD looking at what connects crime, the media and the Internet.

WHY AUSTRALIA
I've been living in London for nearly five years and I'm looking forward to a new challenge. I've explored studying in the United States, but criminology MAs + PhDs in there can last up to seven years with equally expensive fees. Plus, Sydney Uni hosts the Sydney Institute of Criminology, a hub of research I really want to be involved with. 

HOW MUCH
Despite working hard and being nice to people for over four years in London, I haven't managed to save enough to go back to university. So I'm trying to raise half of the course's fees through crowd-funding, falling back on my parents' help and on part-time jobs to fund the rest of my degree. 
Therefore, this campaign's budget goal is £15,000, which will help towards paying the remaining half of my tuition fees and the initial living expenses while I look for a part-time job in Sydney. 

Here is a break-down of costs required to study at Uni Sydney (click on the figures to see where they come from):


Master of Criminology for international students: $38,000 (£19,610.70)


Living expenses for a year: $16,800 (£8,669.55)



I'm trying to raise £15,000 ($29,041.9) of which:

£9,815,6 ($19,000) will go towards the remaining half of my tuition fees


£5,814.4 ($11,254) will go towards initial living expenses such as rent, transport and food



YOU CAN TRUST ME - I PROMISE!

Before you panic, I'm not just a random person asking for money to go to Vegas. I've already been to Vegas, dressed as Hunter S. Thompson.

It was fun, but now I'm an adult. So here's more information about me.
I am not a fake avatar asking for friends, your selfies or your credit card number. You can find me everywhere online. I write for:

My blog Couchsurfer Reviews, which I started just before taking off couchsurfing in the USA alone for two months at the end of my BA 
On Italian Kingdom, for which I write the ""Cosmopolitalian"" column, a the lifestyle guide for Italians in London
On the Huffington Post 

You can also find me on Twitter and LinkedIn. 

As I mentioned, I have BA in Journalism from City University London. My undergraduate dissertation won the prize for best dissertation in the course.


I presented my paper at media conference ECREA 2014 in Lisbon and at the International Journalism Festival in Perugia, which helped me win the Undergraduate Awards 2015 for Media & Journalism.


In my free time, I listen to heavy metal and write novels. I'm currently looking looking to publish my fourth book, a story about toxic relationships and society's fascination with bad boys... Which you might get a sneak peek of in case you decide to help with this campaign :)
WHY I NEED YOUR HELP
Since I've never studied criminology before, it's hard for me to qualify for most course-specific scholarships. The Italian government doesn't offer student loans and neither does the Australian one. 
With a small donation you can help me study my dream degree and take it further: after the MA, I would like to keep pursuing my criminology studies by earning a PhD, focusing on researching new, unexplored areas of cyber-crime and crime and the media. 
WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T REACH MY GOAL?

I've chosen Indiegogo's Flexible Funding option, which means I will still be able to save your contributions and use them towards my degree. Which means that you will still be entitled to all the perks your donation gives you the right to.

    Risks & Challenges I realise helping a random girl on Indiegogo fund her degree might not be your number one life goal. 
However, think about it like this. If we ever meet in a bar, you'll probably find out I'm a huge foodie and an amateur cocktail fan. We would probably end up talking lots and buying each other a drink at some point. 
Although a nice craft cocktail or a pint is always very much appreciated, you would have my eternal gratitude - and one of the perks listed here - if you decided to fund my education instead of my passion for alcoholic drinks.


And if university doesn't leave me too broke, we could always go for that drink and that chat at some point. 
    Other Ways You Can Help We've all been there. We've all been too broke to help - I understand.  But if you do have a Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or an Instagram profile, I'd be eternally grateful if you could share this campaign for the world to see!   Over and out.ItalianoRaccolta fondi per un master in criminologiaSono un'ex pubblicitaria, una blogger e una studentessa di giornalismo che ha smesso di fare scelte facili. Ho deciso di tornare a all'università e seguire il mio sogno: studiare criminologia con un master all'Università di Sydney. Perché passare dal giornalismo alla criminologiaCome la maggior parte dei bambini, un tempo sognavo di fare la poliziotta. A differenza di molti bambini però ho iniziato a leggere manuali di criminologia e psichiatria (con tanto di foto dettagliate delle scene del crimine) quando avevo 10 anni. Ma quando a 17 anni ho fatto domanda all'università, non pensavo di aver la forza di intraprendere una carriera così pericolosa. Quindi ho preso una scorciatoia: mi sono messa a scrivere. Scrivere mi piaceva, e ho pensato che studiando giornalismo avrei potuto investigare vari crimini senza esservi direttamente coinvolta. Peccato che non avessi messo in conto una cosa: i social media.  Ora che grazie a Twitter tutti possono essere giornalisti, tutto quello che mi sentivo di poter offrire era un articolo scritto bene. Il crimine è ovunque: da Twitter a Netflix, il successo di programmi come Making a Murderer significa che parlare di crimini vari, filmarli o analizzarli col plastico a Porta a Porta non è più una gran novità. Perché voglio studiare criminologia adessoSe è più facile quando un crimine viene commesso, ora è il perché che ci interessa. Vogliamo sapere le ragioni dietro un'ingiustizia, oppure vogliamo scoprire cosa porta persone come noi a commettere azioni terribili.La rivelazione è arrivata durante l'Undergraduate Awards Summit nel 2015, dove ho vinto una medaglia per la categoria di media e giornalismo grazie alla mia tesi, che studiava come i giornalisti inglesi hanno usato Twitter per commentare la morte dell'ex primo ministro Margaret Thatcher. Durante una delle conferenze, la Dottoressa e Cyber-Psicologa Mary Aiken ha detto: “Stiamo vivendo dentro uno dei più grandi esperimenti sociali senza regole di tutti i tempi,”riferendosi all'impatto dei social media sulla nostra vita.  Dato che il crimine è così facilmente accessibile online, per me parlarne e scriverne non è più abbastanza. Voglio poterne capire le ragioni e combatterle, perché ora tutti noi, specialmente i più giovani, siamo esposti al crimine.Perché torno a studiareHo studiato cosa porta le persone a comprare un determinato prodotto, a leggere un determinato articolo o a credere in una determinata causa, ma ora voglio passare al lato oscuro: voglio capire le ragioni dietro determinati crimini. Grazie a tutte le opportunità che Londra mi ha offerto però, ora mi sento abbastanza forte per seguire i miei sogni: voglio studiare per assicurarmi un dottorato basato sulla ricerca di cosa lega il crimine ai media e a Internet. Sfortunatamente lavorare e studiare a Londra per quattro anni non è il modo migliore per risparmiare. In tutto questo tempo, non sono riuscita a mettere da parte abbastanza per pagare il mio master.Quanto costaPer questo vorrei raccogliere la metà dei costi del master attraverso il crowd-funding, chiedendo aiuto ai miei genitori e cercando un lavoro part-time per pagare il resto del corso. Questa campagna cerca di raccogliere £15,000 (€19026), che mi aiuteranno a pagare ciò che resta delle rate universitarie e le prime spese mentre cerco un lavoretto a Sydney. Ecco quanto costa studiare all'Università di Sydney (cliccate sui numeri per credere):
Master of Criminology per studenti internazionali: $38,000 (24771,28)
Vitto, alloggio e altre spese per un anno: $16,800 (€10430)

Con questa campagna sto cercando di raccogliere £15,000 ($29,041.9) delle quali: 
£9,815,6 (€12450) serviranno a pagare ciò che resta della rata universitaria 
£5,814.4 (€7375) serviranno per vitto, alloggio etc. 


Perché l'Australia
Ho vissuto a Londra per quasi cinque anni e dopo questa fantastica esperienza vorrei cambiare aria per usufruire di diversi modi di pensare e diversi metodi di ricerca. Ho pensato a studiare negli Stati Uniti, ma lì i master possono durare fino a sette anni con rate altrettanto costose. In più, l'Università di Sydney ospita il Sydney Institute of Criminology, un centro di ricerca con cui vorrei tanto collaborare. 

POTETE FIDARVI, VE LO PROMETTO!
Prima che vi spaventiate, non sono una truffatrice in cerca di soldi per andare a Las Vegas. Sono già stata a Las Vegas, vestita in stile Hunter S. Thompson da Paura e Delirio. 

E' stato divertente, ma adesso è ora di parlare seriamente. Eccovi qualche informazione in più su di me. 
Non sono un profilo fake: potete trovarmi ovunque su Internet. Scrivo per:

Il mio blog Couchsurfer Reviews, che ho iniziato prima di partire per un viaggio negli Stati Uniti tramite Couchsurfing
Su Italian Kingdom, la guida per Italiani all'estero per cui scrivo la rubrica ""Cosmopolitalian"" con consigli su bar e ristoranti
Sulla versione inglese dell'Huffington Post 

Ho una laurea in giornalismo dalla City University di Londra. La mia tesi su come i più seguiti giornalisti inglesi su Twitter hanno usato il social network per commentare la morte dell'ex primo ministro Margaret Thatcher, ha vinto il premio di miglior tesi del corso. 

Ho presentato questa tesi alla conferenza mediatica internazionale ECREA 2014 a Lisbona e al Festival Internazionale del Giornalismo di Perugia, che mi ha aiutato a vincere un premio nella categoria Media e Giornalismo degli Undergraduate Awards 2015.

Nel tempo libero ascolto metal e scrivo romanzi. Sto cercando di pubblicare il mio quarto romanzo, una storia di relazioni malate e l'ossessione che l'industria dell'intrattenimento ha per i bad boys. Date un'occhiata ai premi della campagna di crowd-funding e magari potrete leggerne qualche pagina :)
Perché ho bisogno del vostro aiuto
Non avendo mai studiato criminologia prima, non ho quello che serve per ottenere una borsa di studio. Il governo italiano non offre finanziamenti per studiare all'estero e quello australiano non offre prestiti come quello inglese. 
Con una piccola donazione mi aiutereste a portare avanti il mio sogno, continuando a studiare e, spero, ad assicurarmi un dottorato di ricerca per studiare gli effetti del cybercrime e la relazione tra il crimine e i media.
Cosa succede se non riesco a raccogliere abbastanza soldi?
Ho scelto l'opzione Funding flessibile di Indiegogo, il che significa che potrò comunque tenere le vostre offerte e usarle per finanziare il mio corso. Per voi, questo significa che riuscirete comunque ad ottenere i premi pubblicizzati qui. 
Perché dare i soldi ad una sconosciuta?Mi rendo conto che aiutare una sconosciuta ad andare all'università non sia il vostro obiettivo numero uno. Pensatela così: se un giorno ci vedessimo in un bar, capireste subito che amo cibi particolari e cocktail dalle ricette mirabolanti. Finiremmo a parlare delle tante cose che ci piacciono e ci offriremmo da bere a vicenda. Anche se un bicchiere di birra o un cocktail con l'ombrellino non guastano mai, vi sarei eternamente grata se invece di incoraggiarmi a bere mi incoraggiaste a studiare con una piccola donazione (anche solo £5). E se l'università non mi spenna troppo, possiamo sempre farcelo quel drink. Altri modi in cui potete darmi una manoA volte non è proprio possibile spendere soldi. Lo capisco: ci sono passata. Ma se avete un profilo Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn Instagram, me lo date un piccolo share? Passo e chiudo.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

productive and fulfilling life:
These
statistics do not reflect the true potential of our children. Every child in
Cambodia can and should achieve at a much higher level. What these statistics
tell us is that there is a deeply systemic problem that severely diminishes the
educational and life opportunities of Cambodian children, especially those
growing up in low-income communities.
WHATWe
believe that the key ingredient to solving this problem is leadership—a local
force of leaders who believe deeply that it is possible to put children growing
up in poverty on a life-changing path, who know what it will take to do so, and
who have the ability, experience and conviction to make it happen.Our mission is to enlist the nation's exceptional young leaders in an effort to expand educational opportunities for all children in Cambodia.HOWOur solution starts with the best and brightest Cambodians who are passionate about making a difference in education. We recruit recent top university graduates, then train and place them in classrooms in high-needs schools for two years
with on-going support to effect sustainable change in the form of:
1. 
Increased
number of high-quality and committed teachers in low-income communities across
the country
2. 
Improved
student achievement including academic outcome, mindsets, and aspirations
needed to access life-changing opportunities
3. 
A
future pool of lifelong leaders with conviction, experience, and commitment to
expand education opportunities for all children in Cambodia 
In
the process we will build a coalition of stakeholders – public and private – to
sustainably address educational inequity which is the most pressing problem facing
this country.Teach For Cambodia's Program ModelIMPACT AND GROWTH PLAN By
2018, we plan to place 80 outstanding teachers who will be serving 16,000
students across 25 schools.
We
will begin with an initial cohort of 20 Fellows in the 2016-2017 school year
then grow the number of incoming Fellows by 50% each year for the next three
years.

<b>While in grad school, I worked for five years with teens at Camp Augusta, a residential summer camp in Nevada City, CA. For my last two years, I ran their established teen leadership program online and in person.

I've made more adjustments, and I am getting ready to launch that program into the world as Teen Leadership Courses. Because what parent doesn't want to give their teen some TLC? </b><br/>

<li><i>In 2015, after 20 years working with youth, I completed a Masters in Education.

</div>

<h3><span></span></h3>All startups have inherent risk. I believe this venture will fly because the curriculum is tried and true, refined by the feedback of teens and parents, and I have a large base of support among families in my hometown of 12 years. I do anticipate some challenges, and here are the plans to address them:</div>
</div><div> <ul>
<li>
<b>Business Education: </b>I went to school for education, not for business. Starting a business is a new leap for me. I've been and will continue to receive free support from the Small Business Development Center of California, and will seek other allies and alliances. </li>
<li>
<b>Business Costs: </b>This campaign is a drop in the bucket of what it costs to run a business. I plan to apply for grants for startup businesses and female entrepreneurs. Feel free to point me towards some good ones! </li>
<li>
<b>Low Enrollment: </b>Certain workshops and programming will need a minimum enrollment to be financially sustainable over a longer term. The marketing budget will be tailored to promoting enrollment in courses and workshops, and free content generation will continue build the TLC mailing list to expand the reach of eligible and interested families.</li>
<li>
<b>Website Management:</b> I'm blessed with the support of a website designer who believes in this vision and has experience running online courses. If the needs of teenleadership.org should exceed what I am able to do and what he is able to give, we will need to find a new website manager. The campaign budget will be adjusted accordingly, and if/when we are able to hit stretch funding goals they will go towards website support.</li>
<li>
<b>Challenging Feedback: </b>While my feedback has been mainly positive, I've learned when working with teens in an honest way that encourages them towards growth, there's can be pushback from teens or parents. I have experience acknowledging and learning from this feedback as an opportunity for growth, taking it to heart, and allowing it to let me grow as an educator and gain more training when necessary. </li>
<li>
<b>Accessibility Goals:</b> Making TLC programming available for all youth and families who need it is at the forefront of my mind. While the first round of programming will be tuition-based while TLC is established, I aim to qualify as a vendor to offer curriculum packages and workshops through schools, and apply for grant funding for scholarships to support access for all students regardless of financial status.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p><b>Funding Request</b>: A 20-year old performing arts institution needs $17,500 for operating expenses, vehicle repair and facility improvements for our 2015/2016 after-school program for Washington, DC residents, 6-12 years of age.  </p>

<p><b>Our Challenge</b>: To maintain our studio space in a rapidly developing and popular living and recreation destination with roots in historic performing arts success, in the nation's capital.<br/><br/><b>Mission:</b> “African and Chinese Traditional Cultural Arts of kung fu, lion and dragon dance, and drumming train participants in strength, self-reliance, personal responsibility, and excellence as a means to prepare them to live a meaningful life. <br/><br/><b>VISION:</b>  HTCMLI has staying power because of it's support among city leaders and community participants, and as a result has become the region’s leading center of excellence for youth development. HTCMLI is entering a more mature phase to compete with monied interests that are less interested in arts and more interested in land development. <br/><br/><b>History:</b>  The Hung Tao Choy Mei Leadership Institute was founded in 1995 by Abdur-Rahim Muhammad a native Washingtonian.

Funding Request: A 20-year old performing arts institution needs $17,500 for operating expenses, vehicle repair and facility improvements for our 2015/2016 after-school program for Washington, DC residents, 6-12 years of age.  
Budget: Facilities Maintenance & Repair: $5,000. Architectural designs for studio renovation for better use of space = $1,250; Performance equipment purchase and repair = $4,250; Repairs to donated vehicle used to transport equipment to performances and in and out of storage as needed = $3,500; Lighting for exterior of building to showcase mural $1,000; New exterior signage $2,500
Our Challenge: To maintain our studio space in a rapidly developing and popular living and recreation destination with roots in historic performing arts success, in the nation's capital.Mission: “African and Chinese Traditional Cultural Arts of kung fu, lion and dragon dance, and drumming train participants in strength, self-reliance, personal responsibility, and excellence as a means to prepare them to live a meaningful life. VISION:  HTCMLI has staying power because of it's support among city leaders and community participants, and as a result has become the region’s leading center of excellence for youth development. HTCMLI is entering a more mature phase to compete with monied interests that are less interested in arts and more interested in land development. History:  The Hung Tao Choy Mei Leadership Institute was founded in 1995 by Abdur-Rahim Muhammad a native Washingtonian.  President Muhammad opened the Institute at 1351 U St. NW at a time when many home owners and businesses were hesitant to invest in the area and began teaching children few thought worthy of their attention.

This has been studied and proven over and over again. This is 
why the education system is so hotly debated and so passionately argued 
for. Unfortunately, even as our government is trying to keep it from happening, 
there is a group of students who are truly being left behind their peers
 and the rest of society.<br/>
</div><p><br/>For the better part of the last nine years we have worked at a youth ranch (<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/saving-lives-one-young-man-at-a-time/www.heartmountainnewbeginnings.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HMNB</a>) 
 designed as a group home for 12 - 17 year old at-risk boys, Jessica (MA, LPC) as a
 Licensed Professional Counselor and Travis (M.ed) as the Vice President of 
Operations and Education Director (after being promoted from tutor, to full staff member, to Education Director and subsequently VP of Operations). In our time at HMNB we find
that young men who come from traumatic backgrounds often develop mental 
health disorders (ADHD, ODD, Depression, and on and on) which greatly 
effect their ability to be successful in a mainstream school system. It 
is because of this, that America has seen group homes and residential 
treatment centers pop up all over the country.<br/><br/>Along with the 
traumatic experiences in their youth, we see that most of the young men are from cities, not rural America. This 
seemed to back up Richard Louv's idea of <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/06/130628-richard-louv-nature-deficit-disorder-health-environment/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nature Deprivation</a>.
 What we find though, is that even with these youth programs out there, 
many young men are just too far behind in school by the time their 
parents are able to get them help. They are unable to complete 
their high school education and/or complete their therapeutic treatment before turning 18 and leaving their youth program.<br/><br/>It is with this experience that we have found a great need 
for a place for 18 year old boys to go and finish their high school 
education and learn the skills needed to be successful in their lives. A Christian School that: offers multiple paths to completing a high school diploma,
 where a young man can be immersed in nature, receive multiple forms of 
therapy from a licensed professional counselor, and where he will learn
 to be completely self sufficient. A place that teaches a person not only how
 to pass a test, but teaches how and why you can/should grow your own 
food,  communicate with others, be mindful of one's self and surroundings,
 and be all around good stewards. </p><div> <h3>What This Crowdfund Means for Our Future Clients </h3>
<p> This is a break down of how the funds will be

The first one is a yearly Christmas letter, letting you know what we are doing and who/how your donation has helped. We also have an option where your name will be inscribed on a brick which will be laid in the pathway up to the bunkhouse or from the bunkhouse to the greenhouses. The last perk allows you to have the naming rights to the bunkhouse/school house. These will be a continual reminder to anyone who visits or stays at our campus that you helped make the difference in these young men's lives.

Change and growth is hard, which means some students may avoid and decide to fight against that growth and change. We will combat this challenge by creating a residential Christian environment where students are able to accomplish goals and discover their connection with society, nature and the world as a whole. <br/></p>
<p>""A primary reason for the decline in motivation, discipline, and achievement in schools is a lack of direction, and ownership among young people. Most students have the general perception that whether or not they show up, things still will go on without them. In other words, their contribution is irrelevant."" (Glenn, H. Stephen &amp; Nelson, Jane; Raising Self-Reliant Children in a Self-Indulgent World). So The Academy of Natural Living is designed where the students are an integral part of the daily functioning of their food production, animal care, and the well being of the community; therefore giving their presence at the school purpose and worth. <br/></p>
<p>The other challenge to overcome is diversification. Our goal is to expand over the next few years to include educational opportunities to high school students in our immediate community as well as adult education programs so that we can educate as many people as possible to become self sustainable stewards. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Wear it proudly
By stating what your
dreams, passions or choices of careers 
are right on your person, you can achieve them – ""Cause you are a Girl"".
The mission of “Cause l Am A Girl” is to reinforce a message that will empower girls of all ages in the four corners of the world to achieve their passions, goals and dreams by expressing it proudly on themselves. And not giving consent to those who tell them they cannot do it.
Why Support “Cause I Am A Girl”
In many countries, it is still believed that born as a girl is a
burden for parents and girls are inferior to boys… This way of thinking needs
to be banned and energy needs to be focused towards their real value and how much good girls bring to the world. Women have
made great strides over the years but still there is this minority assumption
in society. 
We need to empower and inspire girls so that they believe in their
value inside and out, and can achieve whatever they put their hearts and minds
to!


Believe It. Achieve It.By wearing the “Cause l Am A Girl” logo on themselves  with their passion  proudly,
(expressing) we hope that girls come to believe it and that one day they achieve it. A girl should be two things: who and what she wants.Coco Chanel - Fashion Designer (1883 - 1971)
Empowerment/Affirmation
Every time a girls creates a
t-shirt, a twin is sent to a Non Governmental Agency (NGO) to be distributed to
a girl.  It might not be their passion, but they will know that another girl half way around the world has this goal. And by wearing it, she supports her and hopefully is inspired to find her own passion and succeed.We hope through affirmation
both girls will fulfill their potential.

<p>Sure, we have the internet in its entirety, but what’s
the point if there’s too much misleading information to go through? We need a
place with information we can trust because the brand puts its reputation on
it. That’s the basis for Howloop. Howloop is an E-Learning site where you can
learn how to do almost anything. With Howloop, simply search for a video on the
topic you’re looking for. Then watch one of our high quality how-to videos. The
video will explain everything you’ll need to know regarding the subject. Howloop
is also a great opportunity for those who love to share and educate as well. If
you’re someone who likes to make high quality videos, but couldn’t make enough
money with other video platforms like YouTube, then you’ll find Howloop an
amazing opportunity. With a portion of money from each sale going to the
uploader, you won’t have to be dependent on money from ads. With Howloop you can
make enough money to not only make high quality videos but to support yourself
as well. Also, a portion of all sales go to an educational charity of your
choice! </p>
<p>We’re also looking to
make our site completely interactive, letting you make the learning experience
best for all learning styles. We want to make Howloop a place where you feel
comfortable learning at your own pace. If you want to learn a whole language or

Would you do anything in your power to reduce children's risk of developing chronic diseases and obesity in the future? As parents we think we definitely would specially if it can be done through a personalized balanced diet. That's why we started BabyNome. With the help of cutting edge science, we can now find out how each child processes different nutrients based on his or her genes and tailor a diet that meets their specific needs. This personalized diet will help parents and caregivers to lower their child's risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes, anemia, cardiovascular diseases, or hypertension that are associated with vitamin, mineral or metabolic deficiencies. 








 is a nutrigenomics (nutrition meets genomics) technology that uses the DNA data found in a child's saliva to analyze more than 40 nutrition and metabolism traits and  generates personalized nutrition recommendations. These recommendations are presented in a nutrition report that parents and caregivers can use to address their child's specific nutritional needs and help them lower their risk of developing different chronic diseases by providing adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals. 
Learn more about BabyNome



The BabyNome computational nutrigenomics technology has been developed based on decade of scientific research and the integration of hundreds of peer-reviewed genome-wide studies worldwide linking 2000+ genetic variations (known as SNPs) to more than 200 nutritional and well-being traits. The BabyNome Personalized Nutrition Report presents the most important nutritional and metabolic traits that are implicated in preventative health.

The Personalized Nutrition Report is a comprehensive 50-page report that covers more than 40 essential nutrition and metabolism traits that tell you how your child's body processes key vitamins and minerals, as well as his or her metabolism and dietary traits: 


The nutrition report has been designed by our nutrition expert specifically for children based on their predisposition level for various nutrition and metabolism traits. The report can be used to guide your child's diet and nutrition throughout her or his most developmentally-crucial childhood years.

Thank you for stopping by, </p><p>My name is Traian and I am a 33 year-old east-european calling himself a learning architect. I worked for the past twelve years trying to transform higher education in Romania. First I was a student activist and then I co-founded the Alternative University in Bucharest (read <a href=""http://www.traianbruma.ro/my-story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my story here</a>).<br/></p><p>I love my work and I consider re-inventing universities one important milestone for humanity going forward. Contributing to this gives meaning to my life so I plan to continue for at least 10 years. Now I feel ready to shift gears and to aspire to a new level of impact. So this project came to be.  </p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;""><p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p></span><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">The book</h1><div><br/></div><div>
<span>Break/Free will be a book for teenagers about universities. Its story will walk them behind the stage of the overwhelming and irresistible reputation that universities have. It will shed fresh light on their upcoming rite of passage into adulthood. My reasonable expectation is to help its teenage readers adjust their “university experience” while inside the university system.</span><br/>

<br/>
</div><p>The unreasonable hope in my heart is that small groups of brave, freedom-loving young people will be encouraged to do the unthinkable: say no to everything an established institution of higher education has to offer and create their own. <span>I will make the case that stepping away from the beaten track can be more joyful and also more messy, exhausting and dangerous. But also, in the end, this unconventional route into adulthood can make its walkers more alive, can free them from the obsolete mental models of the present and it will empower them as adults.</span></p> <p>The book will outline a vision for higher education where students assume the role of creators and full owners of their universities and not consumers. Its graduates can better challenge the status quo, can rebel against the broken ways and refresh society. This book will hint at a network of self-organized learning environments that unite into a game-changing, global university. This is my starting premise. I will allow the journey that follows to shape it.</p> <p>I will gather stories from all continents of the world about individual learning journeys, radical learning architectures, communities, hubs, hackerspaces, rituals and neat tech tools. It will have charming characters going through breathtaking adventures. All of them real. I will include some of my own stories of the past 12 years in building The Alternative University. I will put them all together into a master narrative that gets personal and subjective.

It was shaped by the unlikely story of spinning-off our revolted student activism into an alternative university and the fact that we were so young and inexperienced when we started. I think we have a unique voice to add to the conversation about the future of universities. If it’s just an illusion in my head, writing this book will dispel it.

<span style=""font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The questions to start from</span><br/>

On the “maybe” list I have: Uruguay, Argentina,Chile, Bolivia, Haití, DR Congo, Zimbabwe, Ghana, South Africa and going back to India. </span></p>From a list of 150 places/projects I will select some as I go, no more than 30. I want to visit a few classic universities like MIT (Media Lab) and Stanford (d.School) and some particularly innovative like ASU, Olin College or Quest University. I am most interested in the small radical experiments like Swaraj University, Thiel Fellowships, Open Masters or Deep Springs College. I will stop by some non-higher-education learning designs like Lumiar, Summerhill, Green School, AltSchool, School in the Cloud, Unreasonable Institute and Art of Learning Project. I will also look into a few edtech projects like Open Badges or edX, make it to some conferences like SXSWEdu and get involved with groups like Eco-versities, Lumina, Ashoka U and IDEO. But I will be looking for inspiration in many other places: from informal learning communities in skateparks and makerspaces to self-managed companies like Semco, indigenous tribes, countercultural movements like copyleft, occupy or free software, eco-villages or experimental towns like Auroville.

As I absorb the context naturally, my focus will be to (2) <b>discover organizations</b>, projects, movements or traditions and then ask questions, observe, take notes and collect stories. I will look for the chance to (3) <b>make myself useful</b> in some way; maybe facilitate a workshop, share my story, help with farming or take on a small one-week project. Ultimately, the journey is about (4) <b>meeting and connecting</b> with some of the learning architects, the activists, the visionaries, the wise and enlightened and the troublemakers of this world.

There are 2.3 billion people under 20 and 23.729 universities. These universities will not have enough places. Even if they did, their economic model is too expensive for many more people to go. And even if we had resources, we know that their learning model is ineffective; even counterproductive in nurturing the entrepreneurial changemakers that could steer the world in another direction. </p><p>I see myself as part of a global tribe of people that played for a long time at the edges of higher education. Long enough to know that something radically better is possible at a big scale: universities that are inexpensive, accessible to many more and effective in nurturing people to flourish and transform their world. </p><p>I want to dedicate my next ten years to that possibility. To upgrade my work to that level, I need to upgrade myself. It is a challenge that requires a deeper level of creativity, a better awareness of the world and an ability to connect with people worldwide. There are things to learn and things to unlearn. I hope that making the journey and writing the book will also enable my transformation:  </p><ul>
<li>from a local worldview to a big picture, global awareness;</li>
<li>from reading about people I admire to making selfies with them;</li>
<li>from Romania focused to being globally connected; </li>
<li>from busy and burned-out to being in flow and taking time for quality work;  </li>
<li>from entrepreneur to learning architect; </li>
<li>from boring explainer to charming storyteller; </li>
<li>from telling others to “learn like crazy” to walking the talk big time;  </li>
<li>from a good human being to a better human being.</li>
</ul>In the end, my whole life is no more than a drop in the ocean. No journey will change that. But I feel that, in some way, me walking this individual path of mine is part of a bigger collective story that is being born around the world. The ocean is made out of drops. My intuition whispers to me that the world will change thanks to our mindful efforts but in a way that will surprise all of us. And so I focus on bringing my gift to the world wholeheartedly and I trust the process that it will change the world.<h1><br/></h1><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">What do I Need</h1><br/><p><span>For the full version I need roughly 20 flights of 60.000 km, visas for 19 countries on 5 continents, 300 days of food, accommodation and urban transport in 30 cities. All this will get me to the core of this journey: more than 600 beers :-). Worst case, it can also be hot chocolate or water, just to sit in front of a glass for three hours and interview fascinating people or sit by myself and write. It all adds up to a total of 17.000 euros necessary to complete this journey.

Thank you for stopping by, My name is Traian and I am a 33 year-old east-european calling himself a learning architect. I worked for the past twelve years trying to transform higher education in Romania. First I was a student activist and then I co-founded the Alternative University in Bucharest (read my story here).I love my work and I consider re-inventing universities one important milestone for humanity going forward. Contributing to this gives meaning to my life so I plan to continue for at least 10 years. Now I feel ready to shift gears and to aspire to a new level of impact. So this project came to be.  The book
Break/Free will be a book for teenagers about universities. Its story will walk them behind the stage of the overwhelming and irresistible reputation that universities have. It will shed fresh light on their upcoming rite of passage into adulthood. My reasonable expectation is to help its teenage readers adjust their “university experience” while inside the university system.




The unreasonable hope in my heart is that small groups of brave, freedom-loving young people will be encouraged to do the unthinkable: say no to everything an established institution of higher education has to offer and create their own. I will make the case that stepping away from the beaten track can be more joyful and also more messy, exhausting and dangerous. But also, in the end, this unconventional route into adulthood can make its walkers more alive, can free them from the obsolete mental models of the present and it will empower them as adults. The book will outline a vision for higher education where students assume the role of creators and full owners of their universities and not consumers. Its graduates can better challenge the status quo, can rebel against the broken ways and refresh society. This book will hint at a network of self-organized learning environments that unite into a game-changing, global university. This is my starting premise. I will allow the journey that follows to shape it. I will gather stories from all continents of the world about individual learning journeys, radical learning architectures, communities, hubs, hackerspaces, rituals and neat tech tools. It will have charming characters going through breathtaking adventures. All of them real. I will include some of my own stories of the past 12 years in building The Alternative University. I will put them all together into a master narrative that gets personal and subjective. Hollywood will come begging to make a movie :-).Didn’t they write this book already?Deschooling Society, Pedagogy of the Oppressed or Turning Learning Right Side Up are deep critiques of the system to which I have few things to add. Excellent Sheep illuminates the particular way the elite universities train “brainy but soulless students”. Better Than College or Hacking Your Education guide young people in creating their own individual path. DIY U rounds up some of the emerging alternatives in 2010. There are many more. My contribution will be to (1) weave some of their core ideas, (2) go further by adding recent progress of the emerging radical models around the world and (3) add what I think it is a unique perspective. It was shaped by the unlikely story of spinning-off our revolted student activism into an alternative university and the fact that we were so young and inexperienced when we started. I think we have a unique voice to add to the conversation about the future of universities. If it’s just an illusion in my head, writing this book will dispel it. It is hard to live with that burden :-)The journey
The questions to start from
My quest for inspiration and connection will be guided by questions like: How do the 7 billion people on Planet Earth live? What is important to them? How do these people get good at living life? What is the best ice cream in town? How can the 23.729 universities in the world help the two billion people under 20 to flourish and transform our world? What else is there and who else is there? What is possible next?Where do I go I plan to spend a year traveling to Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba, USA, Canada, Morocco, Egypt, Oman, Russia and Moldova. On the “maybe” list I have: Uruguay, Argentina,Chile, Bolivia, Haití, DR Congo, Zimbabwe, Ghana, South Africa and going back to India. From a list of 150 places/projects I will select some as I go, no more than 30. I want to visit a few classic universities like MIT (Media Lab) and Stanford (d.School) and some particularly innovative like ASU, Olin College or Quest University. I am most interested in the small radical experiments like Swaraj University, Thiel Fellowships, Open Masters or Deep Springs College. I will stop by some non-higher-education learning designs like Lumiar, Summerhill, Green School, AltSchool, School in the Cloud, Unreasonable Institute and Art of Learning Project. I will also look into a few edtech projects like Open Badges or edX, make it to some conferences like SXSWEdu and get involved with groups like Eco-versities, Lumina, Ashoka U and IDEO. But I will be looking for inspiration in many other places: from informal learning communities in skateparks and makerspaces to self-managed companies like Semco, indigenous tribes, countercultural movements like copyleft, occupy or free software, eco-villages or experimental towns like Auroville. See the full list here.  What do I intend to do in each country?First, I will (1) immerse myself in the environment and participate in local daily life; live with someone local, learn about prices, read the news, walk a lot, use the public transport, make friends; talk to people on the street. As I absorb the context naturally, my focus will be to (2) discover organizations, projects, movements or traditions and then ask questions, observe, take notes and collect stories. I will look for the chance to (3) make myself useful in some way; maybe facilitate a workshop, share my story, help with farming or take on a small one-week project. Ultimately, the journey is about (4) meeting and connecting with some of the learning architects, the activists, the visionaries, the wise and enlightened and the troublemakers of this world. I will try to meet some of my heroes like John Taylor Gatto or Ricardo Semler, just to make sure they are real people :-).  Visiting Swaraj University in IndiaAnd it leads to ...I believe that the world needs to take a turn from the current direction. There are 2.3 billion people under 20 and 23.729 universities. These universities will not have enough places. Even if they did, their economic model is too expensive for many more people to go. And even if we had resources, we know that their learning model is ineffective; even counterproductive in nurturing the entrepreneurial changemakers that could steer the world in another direction. I see myself as part of a global tribe of people that played for a long time at the edges of higher education. Long enough to know that something radically better is possible at a big scale: universities that are inexpensive, accessible to many more and effective in nurturing people to flourish and transform their world. I want to dedicate my next ten years to that possibility. To upgrade my work to that level, I need to upgrade myself. It is a challenge that requires a deeper level of creativity, a better awareness of the world and an ability to connect with people worldwide. There are things to learn and things to unlearn. I hope that making the journey and writing the book will also enable my transformation:  
from a local worldview to a big picture, global awareness;
from reading about people I admire to making selfies with them;
from Romania focused to being globally connected; 
from busy and burned-out to being in flow and taking time for quality work;  
from entrepreneur to learning architect; 
from boring explainer to charming storyteller; 
from telling others to “learn like crazy” to walking the talk big time;  
from a good human being to a better human being.
In the end, my whole life is no more than a drop in the ocean. No journey will change that. But I feel that, in some way, me walking this individual path of mine is part of a bigger collective story that is being born around the world. The ocean is made out of drops. My intuition whispers to me that the world will change thanks to our mindful efforts but in a way that will surprise all of us. And so I focus on bringing my gift to the world wholeheartedly and I trust the process that it will change the world.What do I NeedFor the full version I need roughly 20 flights of 60.000 km, visas for 19 countries on 5 continents, 300 days of food, accommodation and urban transport in 30 cities.

I went abroad first time, for voluntary project to Turkey, working with ecological issues there. After I got a chance to visit a great seminar in Malta ""Liberty English Camp"", and met up with ""Students For Liberty"". This two events totally changed me, that I became a young representative of this educational NGOs in Ukraine. From that moment, I helped hundreds of Ukrainian students to develop themselves through international conferences, seminars and camps, how it was with me before. 
I'm super excited for the year ahead of me and I want to include you in my personal transformation! I feel like I'm taking charge of my life which something I've never really done before. But I'm not alone! I'm surrounded by you AMAZING FRIENDS! 




ISFLC 2016 -  is a leadership conference for libertarians, designed to inspire and to help young people find the skills necessary to take charge as a leader in their own life and it gives connections needed to create a direction in participants lives and find who they are. 
I will be surrounded by an amazing group of young leaders with the same mindset as me from whole over the world! Given the opportunity to reflect, learn, and grow in a supportive and encouraging environment, I know I will be able to tap into myself and develop a purpose for my future career! My hope is to return home and share my experiences with everyone. After this trip, broadening my perspective, and cultivating my character, I know I'll be able to help the people around me grow just as much as I have.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>On January 2009, an Israeli tank shelled the home of Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish in the Gaza Strip killing three of his daughters, Bessan, 21, Mayar, 15, and Aya, 13. It was Abuelaish’s response to the loss of his daughters that won him humanitarian awards around the world. Instead of seeking revenge or sinking into despair and hatred, he founded Daughters for Life Foundation in 2010 in memory of his daughters and seeks to honor their love of life, learning, their hopes and dreams for an educated future.</p>
<p>The Daughters for Life Foundation provides Scholarships, Awards, and Fellowship programs for aspiring young women living in the Middle East, to enable them to pursue studies otherwise inaccessible to them. Female students from Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Israel, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, etc... can access full scholarships at the graduate and undergraduate level to study in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Bangladesh. The foundation also provides financial awards to assist students attending Middle Eastern Universities.</p>
<p>We believe that empowering young women through quality education is the key to long-lasting peace in the Middle East and the rest of the world. Our recipients are chosen not only for their academic achievements, often in the face of socio-economic adversity and hardship, but also for their character and commitment to improving the lives of girls and young women in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Our goal is to invest in their potential for leadership and foster their success in whatever fields they choose to pursue. </p>
<h3>Why This Campaign</h3>
<p>For academic year 2016, we are planning to award 10+ girls, who are living in conflict regions such as Syria, Iraq, Palestine and elsewhere in the Middle East, FULL undergraduate scholarships to study in North America. Our scholarships cover the travel, tuition, accommodation, and food.</p>
<p><b>We need your help to get 5 of them the air tickets to get them out of Middle East to pursue better education opportunity!</b></p>
<p>The average cost of round trip air ticket from Middle East to US or Canada is $2000, so we hope to raise $10,000 for five of them.</p>

<p>Fleeing terror, persecution and war, record numbers of desperate refugees continue to make treacherous journeys despite even higher risks of drowning at sea in the increasingly harsh conditions of a European winter. The“Beyond Borders Convoy"" is a growing group of volunteers across Europe, providing emergency supplies and warm food at border crossings during the refugee crises. Our team, formed by Fiona Kelly, Alice Bordoloi and Alex Weston, will depart for Slovenia on the 4th of December.</p>
<p>Most recently we were stationed on the Austrian-German border, setting up a mobile cooking facility (from scratch) to feed refugees who had not eaten in days - including a shockingly high number of children and babies, all of whom were sleeping rough. Our experiences confirmed that there is a huge misconception amongst the general public that governments and international aid agencies are on the ground doing all the necessary work to help. The harsh reality is that this is very often not the case. Many refugees told us that they have been solely dependent on the good will of independent volunteers for their survival since arriving in Europe.</p>
<div><div>
<p></p>
<p>We have chosen Slovenia as our next destination because it has become the new bottleneck on the Balkan Route. We have a fully kitted mobile kitchen on board and a team of 2 professional chefs and their kitchen staff of 8 to cook and serve hot nutritious meals. Many of the refugees currently transitioning through the Slovenian camps en route to the Austrian border - babies and children included - do not have shoes or socks, and have been sleeping rough on concrete floors without food for up to 3 days at a time. Many suffer from hypothermia and other severe health conditions, and many have been subjected to severe brutality by police and armed forces along their way. ""Beyond Borders"" will also deliver emergency supplies (clothing, medical, sanitary items, blankets) that we have collected in our communities. We always call the emergency services immediately in the case of medical emergencies or child protection agencies in the case of unaccompanied minors. </p>
<p><b>With your donations we will provide emergency meals at the cost of 1 EUR per meal for 10,000 people</b>. The contributions will go towards buying red lentils, rice, fresh vegetables cooking oil and spices. We will also will buy additional water and baby formula milk for newborns and babies and make/sanitise bottles in the kitchen (Fiona, the mother of 4, will be on high alert and taking care of the mums with toddlers and babies again). We guarantee total transparency and will communicate all of our expenditure, as well as a blog on our progress on our Facebook page <i>'Beyond Borders Convoy' 04 Dec Slovenia. </i></p>
<p>Our previous experience has shown us that the political situation is extremely volatile. If for some reason, the camps in Slovenia are deemed inaccessible (by the authorities) to independent volunteers on the 4th of December, we have a Plan B in place. We will partner with an organisation on the Slovenian border with Austria - by expanding their kitchens' infrastructure- with our team and equipment (honouring our commitment to the refugees, and our donors to cook 10,000 meals). </p>

</div><h1><b>How Tix Global is going to make a change</b></h1>
<p>Right now in Malaysia, events are not receiving the proper exposure and
necessary tools to reach their true potential. </p>
<p>Events are all about attendance and exposure, the more people who know
about it, the more valuable the event becomes. Bigger events means better quality
events as more resources and effort are invested which can then be recuperated
from ticket sales and other income channels such as sponsor deals.</p>
<p>But what about the smaller events? The events that don't have the
resources or the platform to reach out to the masses. There's where Tix Global
comes in! We are building a one stop platform that boost not only their
management skills but also provides the best chance of making it big through a
pay per sale platform that only charges them for each ticket sold!</p>
<p>Now, maybe you're wondering. We already have eventbrite and peatix and
Facebook Event Page and what have you. But what sets Tix Global apart is the
unified effort of bringing exposure and marketing to all the events that we
host on our platform through a synergy approach where traffic for Event A is
also funnelled into Event B through a more organic and referral approach to
exposure where even our own marketing efforts will directly benefit all the
events held on the platform!</p>
<p>The same under-exposed locals who are craving for as much attention as
the dominating, bigger international branded events. We want to empower them in
building their dreams and to grant them the opportunity to support their local
brothers &amp; sisters so that they too can achieve their artistic goals.</p>
<h1><b>Why We Need The Funds</b></h1>
<p>We've been bootstrapping the development phase for almost half a year
now with our own savings and funds but in order to really bring the platform to
live, we are gonna need your help! </p>
<p>What 70,000 USD will do for us, Tix Global : </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Application development</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Programming and software development</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>User interface development</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Back-end development</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Marketing and operating expenses</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Payment Gateway application and full integration</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Email Blast integration</p>
<p>We implore you to help us build some traction so that with enough of a
running start, we are able to attract bigger investors and receive the
financial aid needed to really bring this platform to life.</p>
<h1><b>The Impact...</b></h1>
<p>Malaysia and Southeast Asia have so many events that are unorganized and
not reaching their full audience possible, and Tix Global is the key to
providing a better experience for all parties involved. Instead of looking to
solve event-related problems across various platforms, coordinators can now
focus on the actual event itself by leaving the management aspect up to Tix Global.</p>
<p>Our range of tools for event organization include:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Custom event page</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Custom form creation (for any details desired)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Accept all payment types and provide client receipts/tickets</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Real time analytics to track progress and respond to issues instantly</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Email blast features integrated into the system (send automatic updates)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Real time check-in system and attendance tracking (lowering waiting
queue)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Organic and user based marketing efforts </p><div>

</div></div>","How Tix Global is going to make a change
Right now in Malaysia, events are not receiving the proper exposure and
necessary tools to reach their true potential. 
Events are all about attendance and exposure, the more people who know
about it, the more valuable the event becomes. Bigger events means better quality
events as more resources and effort are invested which can then be recuperated
from ticket sales and other income channels such as sponsor deals.
But what about the smaller events? The events that don't have the
resources or the platform to reach out to the masses. There's where Tix Global
comes in! We are building a one stop platform that boost not only their
management skills but also provides the best chance of making it big through a
pay per sale platform that only charges them for each ticket sold!
Now, maybe you're wondering. We already have eventbrite and peatix and
Facebook Event Page and what have you. But what sets Tix Global apart is the
unified effort of bringing exposure and marketing to all the events that we
host on our platform through a synergy approach where traffic for Event A is
also funnelled into Event B through a more organic and referral approach to
exposure where even our own marketing efforts will directly benefit all the
events held on the platform!
The same under-exposed locals who are craving for as much attention as
the dominating, bigger international branded events. We want to empower them in
building their dreams and to grant them the opportunity to support their local
brothers & sisters so that they too can achieve their artistic goals.
Why We Need The Funds
We've been bootstrapping the development phase for almost half a year
now with our own savings and funds but in order to really bring the platform to
live, we are gonna need your help! 
What 70,000 USD will do for us, Tix Global : 
· 
Application development
· 
Programming and software development
· 
User interface development
· 
Back-end development
· 
Marketing and operating expenses
· 
Payment Gateway application and full integration
· 
Email Blast integration
We implore you to help us build some traction so that with enough of a
running start, we are able to attract bigger investors and receive the
financial aid needed to really bring this platform to life.
The Impact...
Malaysia and Southeast Asia have so many events that are unorganized and
not reaching their full audience possible, and Tix Global is the key to
providing a better experience for all parties involved. Instead of looking to
solve event-related problems across various platforms, coordinators can now
focus on the actual event itself by leaving the management aspect up to Tix Global.
Our range of tools for event organization include:
· 
Custom event page
· 
Custom form creation (for any details desired)
· 
Accept all payment types and provide client receipts/tickets
· 
Real time analytics to track progress and respond to issues instantly
· 
Email blast features integrated into the system (send automatic updates)
· 
Real time check-in system and attendance tracking (lowering waiting
queue)
· 
Organic and user based marketing efforts

Risk & Challenges

So far, we've half way through our development stage. 
We hope to launch the platform by March 2016.
We have secured our excellent development team that has over 15 years of working experience in coding and product development.
We have secured potential marketing partners that will handle the branding and marketing of the platform early next year.
We have already confirmed arrangements with local banks in Malaysia for our secured payment gateway. 
We have secured several clients that are really keen in adopting the platform into their events next year. 

Our biggest challenge is currently financial support, without a working platform to show for our work, investors aren't too keen. But with so much already invested, ( over 50,00 USD of our own funds ), we aren't in a position to give up. 
We are currently pitching in a startup grant next month, and with several angel investors that look promising. 
Our second biggest risk is economy.
With our Country, Malaysia under heavy scrutiny, investor confidence in our currency has fallen to a new low with the National Currency of Malaysian Ringgit currently trading at over MYR 4.50 to 1 USD with some reports suggesting the ringgit will plunge to MYR 5 to 1 USD early next year.

And please, SPREAD THE WORD!A little bit about meI live in Oakland, California and have two young children who LOVE toys.  We have lots of them.  Too many in my opinion.  But my kids don't think so.  They want more. And more. And more.How do I satisfy my kids' insatiable appetite for fun new toys?  And not spend thirty percent of our income doing it? Or constantly have to offload toys at the local donation station, never knowing whether they actually make it into the hands of other families, or maybe just end up in a landfill or floating around in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch?An online toy recycling program, of course, TOY-CYCLE.ORG.How it worksImagine a sunny Saturday afternoon. A beautiful day to be outside. But you are diligently working to clear the clutter of toys from the living room floor, your kid's bedroom and the hall closet. I mean, seriously, you can barely see the floor! You locate toys your child hasn't played with since kindergarten. Never mind she is in 3rd grade now. What can you do? Get online and offer those toys up to your local TOY-CYCLE.ORG group. Another family wants them. You connect and make arrangements for that family to get the toys from you.  Now, imagine the following Saturday. You see a post for a toy or game your entire family would love.  You respond to the posting family. Woohoo, it turns out they live just eight blocks from you!  You go pick it up, bring it home, thrill your kids.  No shipping, no packaging, no money changing hands.  When you sign up for TOY-CYCLE.ORG, you can try out the site for the first 60 days free.  If it works for you, you'll be asked to pay a small annual membership fee of $12 to help defray the costs of the site's operation and maintenance.

Women are stepping into the arena in droves, more fired up than ever before.
 

 
It's our time.
From arguing with Grandpa at Thanksgiving to running for office and everything in between, Get Politics 101 is designed to equip women with knowledge and confidence to stand in the conversation in new ways. The course will include:

an exploration of women's ""Politics Mindset"" and how to crush perceived obstacles
a solid foundation in government and politics

a guide to choosing the right action for you and shutting out the noise 

 
 

When politics meets comedy, something powerful happens.
Our shoulders relax. Through cry-laugh tears, we see things more clearly.
We’re bringing that power to online education for the first time ever!
We’re casting a dynamic group of women experts and comedians from the amazing talent pool of NYC for a brand new kind of online course. It will be informative, engaging, and entertaining like your favorite comedy talk show.
We need to reach as many women as possible in a brand new way without to-do-lists or judgement. This is how we will move the needle. 
 


We need Get Politics 101 to happen now.
Here's what we need to shoot the pilot:
Production: $14,700
Writing, Direction and Talent: $7,300
Cameras/Lights: $4,350
Location: $1,570
Art and Post Production: $9,250
Total being raised: $37,170
Every amount counts! Every contribution supports us and moves us towards our goal. Poli-Anna needs to happen. If you agree, contribute any amount you can. Your support means the world to us and it is bringing our pilot video closer to reality.
 


Get on board.
We're looking for the right partners who share our values and believe in our mission. If you're a business, this is a great time to put your name on this important project. Just to name a few ideas:

<p>The second half of this fundraiser is to jump start the Nature Connect program, to bring field earth and life science lessons and activities to classrooms across the country, free of any charge to schools, teachers, or students. These lessons and activities will be built around photos, videos, and data collected by students in the <a href=""http://sternberg.fhsu.edu/active-learning/camps/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sternberg Science Camps</a> during field programs. I will use these materials to create Next Generation Science Standard-aligned classroom materials. (This is crucial, as it allows teachers to justify using the lessons without putting their students behind on standardized test prep.) The lesson activities are key, and will introduce students to field science techniques and practices while hitting concept benchmarks during interactive exercises. <strong>All for free for educators to use in their classrooms, and accessible with a simple download of a module that includes media, data, instructions, rubrics, content outlines, and implementation support for the lesson+activity.

<h3>Why field sciences?</h3>
<p>Our understanding of how our planet functions is built on field research, exploring and answering questions in the earth and life sciences. In the face of a changing planet, we need as many excited young people as possible trained in the basics of field work, science, and natural history. Beyond training a new generation of future scientists, I want to recruit, train, and educate students who go on to be business owners, political leaders, lawyers, teachers, parents of their own children, and science-literate members of society with an informed appreciation for natural sciences. This means making impactful, experiential education opportunities available as widely as possible, in ways that will engage student’s attention, and inspire them to start asking their own questions. This starts with removing financial barriers to opportunity.</p>

<h3>Nature-Based Experiential Learning, For All</h3>
<p>Not all students have easy access to science learning opportunities. Low income students in urban and rural schools face some of the toughest challenges in pursuing their interests in science. A combination of lacking opportunities and economic resources can box out entire demographics of talented, driven students anxious to explore. A 2010 cooperative study by the Census Bureau, US Department of Education, and National Center For Education Statistics found the highest concentrations of youth living in poverty to be urban and rural in the West, Midwest, and South. Economically disadvantaged schools in urban and rural settings typically suffer from a sharp lack of resources for teachers to engage students in natural sciences in the classroom.</p> <p><strong>Here, I see two problems that can be approached simultaneously:</strong><br/>1) Socioeconomically disadvantaged students looking for opportunities to pursue interests in earth and life science.<a href=""http://sternberg.fhsu.edu/active-learning/camps/high-school-science-camps/sternberg-biology-camp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482462970/cq6emotsejmv8qfpkhqk.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></a></p>
<p>2) Resource-strapped schools lacking the ability to provide students with high quality, engaging classroom lessons and content to get students excited about science while complying with Next Generation Science Standard guidelines.  </p>
<h3>
<br/>A Solution to Kindle Interest in Nature, and Science</h3>
<p>Engaging students from underserved rural and urban communities, and providing them with the knowledge, confidence, and informational resources to pursue their interests in science and continue their education, are my biggest driving forces in operating these camp programs.<br/><br/>Your contribution will help train a new, diverse generation of earth and life science students in the places that need these resources the most.</p>

<p><strong>Before factoring in any education direct-purchase discounts (which many companies do), this equipment accounts $13,000, half of my $26,000 fundraising goal.</strong><br/><br/>Students will be trained in the use and maintenance of all equipment purchased during respective camp programs. This training is a central part of the camps. Students leave with functional skills relevant to field science in addition to greater knowledge of science concepts. In using this equipment, students will help gather materials I will use to build the Nature Connect classroom modules.<a href=""http://sternberg.fhsu.edu/active-learning/camps/middleschool/biology/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482463128/pmhwyodc68cxvtgup6g3.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></strong></a></p>
<p><strong>The other $13,000 in my fundraising goal will go towards financial aid scholarships to camps students. These scholarships are hugely important in insuring as many students excited about earth and life sciences can attend as possible. </strong></p>
<p>As our recruiting efforts and number of enrollments have grown, so have requests for needed financial assistance. Over the past three years, I have been able to provide over $8,000 in financial aid to students via donations. As the camps program grows and becomes more widely known, the need for financial aid funds will only increase. This $13,000 will be used to cover requests in 2017, and boost funds for 2018.</p>

<h3><strong>Fighting for student opportunity</strong></h3>
<p>Understanding of geology, paleontology, and field biology are the keys to the past, present, and future of our planet. Natural history studies have been slowly fading out of our classrooms and cultural awareness for decades, and we are the worse for it. Through the Nature Connect program, I want to give students a jolt of excitement for natural history, observation, and inquiry. We cannot take every student to the <a href=""http://sternberg.fhsu.edu/active-learning/camps/high-school-science-camps/sternberg-biology-camp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chiricahua Mountains</a>, or <a href=""http://sternberg.fhsu.edu/active-learning/camps/high-school-science-camps/expedition-ecuador/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cloud forest of Ecuador</a> to explore wildlife. Nor can we take every student to the <a href=""http://sternberg.fhsu.edu/active-learning/camps/high-school-science-camps/sternberg-paleontology-camp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">chalk beds of Kansas to explore the fossils</a> and geology of the ancient sea. With your help, we can begin work to bring some of those experiences to students anywhere in the country.<br/><br/>I will use stimulating, vibrant lessons and activities that draw straight from our field camp programs to drive observation, inquiry, and engagement with science through the spectacle of the natural world. <strong>But I can’t do it without your help.</strong></p>

<li>We are a small museum in a very low density population area, meaning this crowdfund is heavily reliant on word of mouth and social media extending outside our home-region.</li>
<li>The success of Nature Connect is predicated on teachers buying in to using the lessons.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addressing Risks and Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is the second crowdfund I have run. (The first was to start the Sternberg Science Camps in 2014.) I learned a lot from the experience, and my 2.5 years on the job since.</li>
<li>Despite being small, we have a skilled, dedicated staff devoted to accessible science education opportunities for all students.</li>
<li>Exercising connections to professional educator organizations, and direct connections to classrooms teachers, I will pilot the Nature Connect programs in a small set of initial classrooms, and work out from there. Widespread use of the lesson modules will not happen over night, but I'm confident that with a high quality product, the program will sell itself. Being free helps too!</li>
<li>As word spreads throughout the region and I get better at marketing, student enrollments have steadily increased. Since 2014, enrollment in the Sternberg Science Camps has tripled. Being able to recruit economically disadvantaged students with the confidence of scholarship support will be invaluable in this effort.</li>

<p>My name is David Levering. I have nearly two full years of combined time spent in the field with youth doing experiential science education programs. I have been a certified Wilderness First Responder for going on seven years. I have first-hand experience and coursework in wilderness safety, skills, and best practices.<br/><br/>My education includes a Bachelors of Science degree in geology from University of Oregon, and a Masters of Science degree in zoology from Oklahoma State University. At both institutions, my studies emphasized vertebrate paleontology, paleoecology, and principles of evolution and ecology in modern systems.<br/><br/>These experiential education programs are a result of almost a decade of planning, framing, cooperation, relationship-building, setting goals and reaching them. I'm just getting started, and hope you will join me in my effort to bring exciting earth and life science education experiences to as many students as possible. </p>

We offer nine single-day programs about natural sciences for 1st-5th grades during the summer, as part of the Sternberg Museum Science Camps.</p><p><strong>Why experiential education?</strong><br/>Learning by doing is the absolute soundest method of teaching outdoor and field science skills. Students in the field programs are guided through the use of tools and techniques, with the goal of them being able to work proficiently at basic fieldwork tasks by the end of the program. Feedback from students shows that it works. Returners, coming back a year later, retain functional knowledge of skills and procedures, demonstrate increased competence and confidence, and show greater initiative during field work and during camp tasks (setting up and breaking camp, loading vehicles, cooking meals, etc).</p><p><strong>Why base the Nature Connect activities and lessons on the Next Generation Science Standards?</strong><br/>In order to justify using the lessons to administrators, and to parents, educators need to know they will not be getting behind on preparing their students for standardized tests required each year. My goal is to work with the standards to create lessons and activities that teachers will use without anxiety over getting behind schedule.

For students fascinated by earth and life science, getting into the field can be an invaluable growth and learning opportunity. Hands-on experience documenting wildlife, exploring rock formations, and excavating fossils builds skills, knowledge, and character, all invaluable for a budding naturalist. My goal is to expand the availability of the Sternberg Science Camps programs to more students from underprivileged backgrounds.Participating in outdoor science education programs was an immensely important part of my teenage years. The growth I underwent in those programs learning about field paleontology continues to astound me. With that growth came opportunity, and a place to belong: paid jobs to build my resume, a path in college, lifelong friends with shared interests in science, and mentors that helped me reach my goals. I would simply not be who or where I am now, working as professional science educator and part-time researcher, without attending those programs in my youth.Without the financial aid I received from the camp program, I would never have been able to attend in the first place.Now, I run my own outdoor science education camps program, and I am working to create the same opportunities for a new generation of students driven by excitement and curiosity.I am campaigning to raise funds for student scholarships to attend the Sternberg Museum Science Camps program I run in western Kansas. I founded this program in 2014, to bring the kinds of transformative experiences I had to students who until now have had little access to such opportunities. My goal is to raise $13,000 for financial aid, to help economically disadvantaged students pursue their passions in earth and life science. 


 


The second half of this fundraiser is to jump start the Nature Connect program, to bring field earth and life science lessons and activities to classrooms across the country, free of any charge to schools, teachers, or students. These lessons and activities will be built around photos, videos, and data collected by students in the Sternberg Science Camps during field programs. I will use these materials to create Next Generation Science Standard-aligned classroom materials. (This is crucial, as it allows teachers to justify using the lessons without putting their students behind on standardized test prep.) The lesson activities are key, and will introduce students to field science techniques and practices while hitting concept benchmarks during interactive exercises. All for free for educators to use in their classrooms, and accessible with a simple download of a module that includes media, data, instructions, rubrics, content outlines, and implementation support for the lesson+activity. I want to make it as easy as possible for classroom science educators to bring these engaging, exciting classroom lessons to their students, irrespective of the school's finances. As a bonus, the students engage with science concepts in simulation of field research activities conducted by professional scientists.   In order to collect the photos, videos, and data needed to build the Nature Connect classroom lesson modules, I need to boost the quality of field equipment used by camps students in the field. To do this, my goal is to raise $13,000 for field equipment.Camps students receive focused training on the use of all equipment used to collect data and media. Double education bonus! See just below for a list of what I'm planning to add to the camps field gear armory, to facilitate the Nature Connect program.

Why field sciences?
Our understanding of how our planet functions is built on field research, exploring and answering questions in the earth and life sciences. In the face of a changing planet, we need as many excited young people as possible trained in the basics of field work, science, and natural history. Beyond training a new generation of future scientists, I want to recruit, train, and educate students who go on to be business owners, political leaders, lawyers, teachers, parents of their own children, and science-literate members of society with an informed appreciation for natural sciences. This means making impactful, experiential education opportunities available as widely as possible, in ways that will engage student’s attention, and inspire them to start asking their own questions. This starts with removing financial barriers to opportunity.

Nature-Based Experiential Learning, For All
Not all students have easy access to science learning opportunities. Low income students in urban and rural schools face some of the toughest challenges in pursuing their interests in science. A combination of lacking opportunities and economic resources can box out entire demographics of talented, driven students anxious to explore. A 2010 cooperative study by the Census Bureau, US Department of Education, and National Center For Education Statistics found the highest concentrations of youth living in poverty to be urban and rural in the West, Midwest, and South. Economically disadvantaged schools in urban and rural settings typically suffer from a sharp lack of resources for teachers to engage students in natural sciences in the classroom. Here, I see two problems that can be approached simultaneously:1) Socioeconomically disadvantaged students looking for opportunities to pursue interests in earth and life science.
2) Resource-strapped schools lacking the ability to provide students with high quality, engaging classroom lessons and content to get students excited about science while complying with Next Generation Science Standard guidelines.  

A Solution to Kindle Interest in Nature, and Science
Engaging students from underserved rural and urban communities, and providing them with the knowledge, confidence, and informational resources to pursue their interests in science and continue their education, are my biggest driving forces in operating these camp programs.Your contribution will help train a new, diverse generation of earth and life science students in the places that need these resources the most.
 


 
Your contribution will help us:
Purchase the equipment we need to create dynamic science lessons and activities, and train camps students in the use of professional-quality field equipment.

 
Before factoring in any education direct-purchase discounts (which many companies do), this equipment accounts $13,000, half of my $26,000 fundraising goal.Students will be trained in the use and maintenance of all equipment purchased during respective camp programs. This training is a central part of the camps. Students leave with functional skills relevant to field science in addition to greater knowledge of science concepts. In using this equipment, students will help gather materials I will use to build the Nature Connect classroom modules.
The other $13,000 in my fundraising goal will go towards financial aid scholarships to camps students. These scholarships are hugely important in insuring as many students excited about earth and life sciences can attend as possible. 
As our recruiting efforts and number of enrollments have grown, so have requests for needed financial assistance. Over the past three years, I have been able to provide over $8,000 in financial aid to students via donations. As the camps program grows and becomes more widely known, the need for financial aid funds will only increase. This $13,000 will be used to cover requests in 2017, and boost funds for 2018.
 


 
If we exceed our goal:

We will be able to provide more scholarships for larger amounts to student applicants!
More kids excited about earth and life science get to join the Sternberg Science Camps trips!
We will have more students in our field teams, allowing us to cover more ground, collect more media and data for the Nature Connect lessons and activities I will build.


If we do not reach our goal:


We won’t be able to provide as much financial as I estimate we’ll need in 2017.
We won’t be able to get all of the equipment necessary to create the best classroom programs possible with Nature Connect.
We will also not be able to provide as robust equipment use training to camps students out in the field.

 
Representation disparities still exist in the sciences. By growing our financial aid funding pool, the Sternberg Museum Science Camps staff will be able to more actively recruit gifted students excited about science to come participate, and interact with other students that share their interests. This group bonding aspect has been one of the strongest pieces of positive feedback camps staff has received from students and parents.
Your donation can help us change a summer, change a year, change the life of a student. In just three years since starting our programs, we have received a tremendous outpouring of positive feedback from parents and students.
Feedback from students.Feedback from parents.
Fighting for student opportunity
Understanding of geology, paleontology, and field biology are the keys to the past, present, and future of our planet. Natural history studies have been slowly fading out of our classrooms and cultural awareness for decades, and we are the worse for it. Through the Nature Connect program, I want to give students a jolt of excitement for natural history, observation, and inquiry. We cannot take every student to the Chiricahua Mountains, or cloud forest of Ecuador to explore wildlife. Nor can we take every student to the chalk beds of Kansas to explore the fossils and geology of the ancient sea. With your help, we can begin work to bring some of those experiences to students anywhere in the country.I will use stimulating, vibrant lessons and activities that draw straight from our field camp programs to drive observation, inquiry, and engagement with science through the spectacle of the natural world. But I can’t do it without your help.

We are a small museum in a very low density population area, meaning this crowdfund is heavily reliant on word of mouth and social media extending outside our home-region.
The success of Nature Connect is predicated on teachers buying in to using the lessons.

Addressing Risks and Challenges

This is the second crowdfund I have run. (The first was to start the Sternberg Science Camps in 2014.) I learned a lot from the experience, and my 2.5 years on the job since.
Despite being small, we have a skilled, dedicated staff devoted to accessible science education opportunities for all students.
Exercising connections to professional educator organizations, and direct connections to classrooms teachers, I will pilot the Nature Connect programs in a small set of initial classrooms, and work out from there. Widespread use of the lesson modules will not happen over night, but I'm confident that with a high quality product, the program will sell itself. Being free helps too!
As word spreads throughout the region and I get better at marketing, student enrollments have steadily increased. Since 2014, enrollment in the Sternberg Science Camps has tripled. Being able to recruit economically disadvantaged students with the confidence of scholarship support will be invaluable in this effort.

 



My name is David Levering. I have nearly two full years of combined time spent in the field with youth doing experiential science education programs. I have been a certified Wilderness First Responder for going on seven years. I have first-hand experience and coursework in wilderness safety, skills, and best practices.My education includes a Bachelors of Science degree in geology from University of Oregon, and a Masters of Science degree in zoology from Oklahoma State University. At both institutions, my studies emphasized vertebrate paleontology, paleoecology, and principles of evolution and ecology in modern systems.These experiential education programs are a result of almost a decade of planning, framing, cooperation, relationship-building, setting goals and reaching them. I'm just getting started, and hope you will join me in my effort to bring exciting earth and life science education experiences to as many students as possible. 
 
Do you have natural history science programs and scholarships for younger kids?We do! We offer nine single-day programs about natural sciences for 1st-5th grades during the summer, as part of the Sternberg Museum Science Camps.Why experiential education?Learning by doing is the absolute soundest method of teaching outdoor and field science skills. Students in the field programs are guided through the use of tools and techniques, with the goal of them being able to work proficiently at basic fieldwork tasks by the end of the program. Feedback from students shows that it works. Returners, coming back a year later, retain functional knowledge of skills and procedures, demonstrate increased competence and confidence, and show greater initiative during field work and during camp tasks (setting up and breaking camp, loading vehicles, cooking meals, etc).Why base the Nature Connect activities and lessons on the Next Generation Science Standards?In order to justify using the lessons to administrators, and to parents, educators need to know they will not be getting behind on preparing their students for standardized tests required each year. My goal is to work with the standards to create lessons and activities that teachers will use without anxiety over getting behind schedule. The Nature Connect classroom modules will serve as standards-congruent learning experiences for students with bonus-added material: media and data pulled straight from the field to engage them with content standards, and give them a glimpse at how science actually gets done in the field.Are all the Nature Connect activities digital? What about schools that don’t have enough computers for all their students?While all of the activity and lesson materials will be made available online, not all will require every student to have access to a computer. We will be working with teachers to find cost-effective, efficient solutions to resource deficiencies without sacrificing impact or educational content of the Nature Connect materials.Are you working with other scientists or educators on this project?Absolutely! While my background is pretty well-rounded, I definitely don’t have universal expertise in field work or pedagogy. I have a network of other professional educators and scientists who contribute their time as seasonal staff for the field programs, or serve as informal consultants. The core staff will grow with the field and Nature Connect programs as needed.What equipment will you be purchasing?I will be purchasing digital cameras, camera lenses, motion-detecting camera traps, a directional parabolic microphone kit, binoculars, Brunton geologic surveying compasses, and headlamps. All equipment will be used in the summer field programs. Students will be trained in the use and maintenance of the equipment by instructional staff in the field.

Nadine's Kitchen is a pop-up restaurant where people's spirits will be raised by an earful of soulful, genre-bending music and a stomach-full of Southern-inspired yet decidedly Northwest-raised food fusion.

Mentors from the Seattle music, arts and foodie scenes will teach these young trainees valuable job skills and introduce them into networks that can support their ambitions.

<p>Let me start by saying, <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span>thank you for visiting our campaign page and considering making a donation. This campaign is raising funds on behalf of  Liberian Council on Rural Poverty Alleviation's <b>""Empower Education with Bicycles, Dewoein District”</b> project </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i></i>In Dewoein, a province of Bomi County in Western Liberia, access to education and the opportunity to learn, something which every child must get regardless of their family background and community which they belong, is depressing for school children because of the lack of transportation means combined with long distances they have to walk  to school every day. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A little over 1,000 school children in the province walk 3-5 km to school every day. This cuts into their learning time and consequently affects school attendance and learning outcomes. In fact, sixty-five percent of these children do not go to school every day due to the long distances they have to trek to school every day. Parents of these children are unable to help them overcome the stress of walking this long distance because of poverty. Unlike you and I, they don't have any profession to </span>earn sustainable income. Cassava
farming and charcoal burning are the two main sources for income and  livelihood support.  In fact, their per
capita income per day is less than 2USD.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This state of condition is preventing these school children in the province from getting an adequate quality basic  education, and will be
ill-equipped to fight the cycle of poverty that affects their lives.</span>
</p>
<p>But we can change this - <b><i>by offering hope and  the education they
need and deserve.</i></b>  Working together
with you, we at Liberian Council on Rural Poverty Alleviation (LICORPA) want to
provide them with a proven vehicle for educational empowerment: <b>a bicycle.</b>
It’s proven that by providing school children who have   long distances
to travel to school with bicycles - shortening their travel time by up to 70%- their school attendance
and learning outcomes improve substantially. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>And that’s why we're obliged to launch this fundraising campaign, and we are appealing to you to join us and make your widow's might donations to this campaign .</i></b><br/></p>

improving access to education in Dewoein District, and its objective is to
increase school attendance and learning outcomes from the low of 10% to the
high of 20% at the end of the project.</span></p>
<p>Here are just few ways your donations will offer hope and education school children in Dewoein District need and deserve:</p>
<p>·<span> H</span>elp school children overcome
the stress of walking 3-5 km  to school every day.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Help school children get to
school on time and effectively participate in class learning work.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Encourage school children to
regularly attend school hereby increasing regular school attendance and
improving learning outcomes substantially.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Help the children to become
educated, fight the cycle of poverty, and contribute to the development of
their communities. </p>
<p>We are interested in this project for four main reasons.
Firstly, we believe, access
 to quality basic education and the opportunity to learn, is something which every child 
must get regardless of their family background and community which they 
belong; secondly, we believe in the axiom that if you educate a
child, you educate a community; thirdly, our children are our future and therefore, we must strive to protect that future; and fourthly, <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">we have a responsibility
to supporters like you to ensure that our philanthropic activities are highly
impactful. This campaign reflects our commitment to all of these goals.</span></p>

<p>This project will help to promote regular school attendance and improve learning outcomes
substantially. Moreover, it will help reduce poverty in the province because when the children are educated, they will overcome poverty and consequently  return to contribute to the development of their communities. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There
are  inherent risks and challenges  in the implementation of the project, and
they are: (1) some students might refuse to go to school after receiving the
bicycles, (2) some students might sell the bicycles and convert the money into
personal use, and (3) some students might decide to use the bicycles
for rental purposes.   To avoid the occurrence of these, the
following outlined measures will be adopted by LICORPA. (1)Community Monitoring Committees (CMC) will
be setup. These committees in collaboration with LICORPA,  will select
 students most in need and oversee the use of the bicycles, (2) Recipients
will learn about bicycle safety and sign an agreement with LICORPA for regular
school attendance, and (3) bi-weekly follow-up visitations will be made by LICORPA's Field Officer to get data on  regular school attendance and learning outcomes of beneficiaries. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Let me start by saying,  thank you for visiting our campaign page and considering making a donation. This campaign is raising funds on behalf of  Liberian Council on Rural Poverty Alleviation's ""Empower Education with Bicycles, Dewoein District” project 
In Dewoein, a province of Bomi County in Western Liberia, access to education and the opportunity to learn, something which every child must get regardless of their family background and community which they belong, is depressing for school children because of the lack of transportation means combined with long distances they have to walk  to school every day. 
A little over 1,000 school children in the province walk 3-5 km to school every day. This cuts into their learning time and consequently affects school attendance and learning outcomes. In fact, sixty-five percent of these children do not go to school every day due to the long distances they have to trek to school every day. Parents of these children are unable to help them overcome the stress of walking this long distance because of poverty. Unlike you and I, they don't have any profession to earn sustainable income. Cassava
farming and charcoal burning are the two main sources for income and  livelihood support.  In fact, their per
capita income per day is less than 2USD.
This state of condition is preventing these school children in the province from getting an adequate quality basic  education, and will be
ill-equipped to fight the cycle of poverty that affects their lives.

But we can change this - by offering hope and  the education they
need and deserve.  Working together
with you, we at Liberian Council on Rural Poverty Alleviation (LICORPA) want to
provide them with a proven vehicle for educational empowerment: a bicycle.
It’s proven that by providing school children who have   long distances
to travel to school with bicycles - shortening their travel time by up to 70%- their school attendance
and learning outcomes improve substantially. 
And that’s why we're obliged to launch this fundraising campaign, and we are appealing to you to join us and make your widow's might donations to this campaign .



 In fact, we are concerned that without your support, we won’t have the funds needed to help these school children.The project seeks the goal of
improving access to education in Dewoein District, and its objective is to
increase school attendance and learning outcomes from the low of 10% to the
high of 20% at the end of the project.
Here are just few ways your donations will offer hope and education school children in Dewoein District need and deserve:
· Help school children overcome
the stress of walking 3-5 km  to school every day.
· 
Help school children get to
school on time and effectively participate in class learning work.
· 
Encourage school children to
regularly attend school hereby increasing regular school attendance and
improving learning outcomes substantially.
· 
Help the children to become
educated, fight the cycle of poverty, and contribute to the development of
their communities. 
We are interested in this project for four main reasons.
Firstly, we believe, access
 to quality basic education and the opportunity to learn, is something which every child 
must get regardless of their family background and community which they 
belong; secondly, we believe in the axiom that if you educate a
child, you educate a community; thirdly, our children are our future and therefore, we must strive to protect that future; and fourthly, we have a responsibility
to supporters like you to ensure that our philanthropic activities are highly
impactful. This campaign reflects our commitment to all of these goals.

<br/><p></p>My name is Chris Harris, and I,
along with my fellow students, want to share Aikido and fellowship with my community. We have all chipped in to make this happen, and we will continue to fund ourselves as much as possible. Given the scope of what we are trying to acheive, we are reaching out for your help.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1321518/files/20150324075549-10628729_10204609727781879_9089778429026353916_o.jpg?1427208949"" src="""" style=""width: 361.66px; height: 217px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Our mission is to
provide a safe, harmonious environment where people, regardless of age, race,
gender, body type, or religion can practice and study the art of Aikido.
AikiState is committed to expanding our knowledge of Aikido by traditional,
modern, and innovative training methods.</span></p>
<p><span>We are devoted to
serving the community though humanitarian activities as well, and we intend to
share our love for our community through several community service activities
throughout our year. </span></p>
<p>We also wish to include the Deaf community in our practice. Tampa Bay harbors more than 4 million people,
and a large Deaf community as well. I hope to be able to share my art with this
often overlooked, but wholly engaged group. Both my wife and I have a bit of training in ASL, American Sign
Language, and we have always enjoyed both the culture and the people of the
Deaf community. We hope to include this group in our dojo in a way that has not
been done before. We would like to invite the Deaf community of Tampa Bay into
our lives, our hearts, our dojo.<br/>

<li><p>We are estimating practice space funds at $15000. This will cover six months of rent  ($9000), six months of utilities ($3000),  six months of insurance ($500), paint and cleaning supplies for initial move-in ($1500), and new signs for our new dojo ($1000).</p></li>
<li><p><b>Mats for our dojo- </b>($7000)   We are excited to be adding brand new mats on which our members can safely practice. We will be ordering Dollamur mats directly from the manufacturer, at a cost of $4683.26, for a square footage of 860. The remaining mat funds will be used to create a raised platform on which the mats will sit, allowing for better spring and more comfortable falls. We are estimating the cost of building this platform at around $2300.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Marketing- </b>In order to announce our official arrival to Tampa Bay, we will be spending an initial investment of $2000 into local newspaper, television, and billboard ads. This will also include fliers and stickers given at all our local colleges and universities, we expect this initial investment to cover approximately the first two months of marketing materials. The remaining funds will be put towards welcome packages for new members.</p></li>
<li><p><b> Decor and Seating- </b> In order to align ourselves with Aikido tradition, we will be placing a kamiza in the front of the mats. This Japanese tradition honors our founder by placing a picture of him alongside a few weapons and decorations. We consider this to be the crown of our dojo, and will be spending no less that $750 on this single piece. The remaining $1250 will be spent on visitor seating, benches in locker rooms, and overall decor.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Training equipment- </b> We would like our students to be prepared in any situation, and therefore we will also provide weapons training. Our budget for these supplies are as follows: Tonto (wooden knives, pictured below)- set of 15- $150. Bokken ( wooden sword, pictured below)- set of 15 $240. Jo (wooden staff, pictured below) Set of 15- $300. Weapons rack (pictured below) set of two- $90. Training hand guns - 2 for $30. Decorative basket for small weapons - $30.<br/></p></li>

</div></div>","*Special thanks to Heather Martin for interpreting our video. Heather will graduate this summer from the Ohio University Lancaster Interpreter Training Program. 
 


My name is Chris Harris, and I,
along with my fellow students, want to share Aikido and fellowship with my community. We have all chipped in to make this happen, and we will continue to fund ourselves as much as possible. Given the scope of what we are trying to acheive, we are reaching out for your help.


Our mission is to
provide a safe, harmonious environment where people, regardless of age, race,
gender, body type, or religion can practice and study the art of Aikido.
AikiState is committed to expanding our knowledge of Aikido by traditional,
modern, and innovative training methods.
We are devoted to
serving the community though humanitarian activities as well, and we intend to
share our love for our community through several community service activities
throughout our year. 
We also wish to include the Deaf community in our practice. Tampa Bay harbors more than 4 million people,
and a large Deaf community as well. I hope to be able to share my art with this
often overlooked, but wholly engaged group. Both my wife and I have a bit of training in ASL, American Sign
Language, and we have always enjoyed both the culture and the people of the
Deaf community. We hope to include this group in our dojo in a way that has not
been done before. We would like to invite the Deaf community of Tampa Bay into
our lives, our hearts, our dojo.

   What We Need & What You Get
**For corporate sponsorship opportunities, please contact us via AikiState@Gmail.com



**Tee Shirt designs can be viewed in the gallery**


For our dojo to be able to support the capacity we are anticipating, we will be using funds raised for the following:




· 
Practice Space $15000
· 
Mats $7000
· 
Marketing $3000
· 
Décor and Seating $2000
· 
Training Equipment $1000
· 
Business Fees and other related expenses $2000
 BREAK DOWN AND PERKS  
Practice space- We are currently looking at several options for dojo space. Once the campaign is completed and we have a better idea of our budget, we will make the final decision. 





We are estimating practice space funds at $15000. This will cover six months of rent  ($9000), six months of utilities ($3000),  six months of insurance ($500), paint and cleaning supplies for initial move-in ($1500), and new signs for our new dojo ($1000).
Mats for our dojo- ($7000)   We are excited to be adding brand new mats on which our members can safely practice. We will be ordering Dollamur mats directly from the manufacturer, at a cost of $4683.26, for a square footage of 860. The remaining mat funds will be used to create a raised platform on which the mats will sit, allowing for better spring and more comfortable falls. We are estimating the cost of building this platform at around $2300.







Marketing- In order to announce our official arrival to Tampa Bay, we will be spending an initial investment of $2000 into local newspaper, television, and billboard ads. This will also include fliers and stickers given at all our local colleges and universities, we expect this initial investment to cover approximately the first two months of marketing materials. The remaining funds will be put towards welcome packages for new members.
 Decor and Seating-  In order to align ourselves with Aikido tradition, we will be placing a kamiza in the front of the mats. This Japanese tradition honors our founder by placing a picture of him alongside a few weapons and decorations. We consider this to be the crown of our dojo, and will be spending no less that $750 on this single piece. The remaining $1250 will be spent on visitor seating, benches in locker rooms, and overall decor.
Training equipment-  We would like our students to be prepared in any situation, and therefore we will also provide weapons training. Our budget for these supplies are as follows: Tonto (wooden knives, pictured below)- set of 15- $150. Bokken ( wooden sword, pictured below)- set of 15 $240. Jo (wooden staff, pictured below) Set of 15- $300. Weapons rack (pictured below) set of two- $90. Training hand guns - 2 for $30. Decorative basket for small weapons - $30.
. Remaining budget will be used for weapons maintenance and a library of used Aikido books.














Business fees and other related expenses. As with any profitable business, we are aware and prepared for the necessary buget for administrative costs. This includes; an LLC filing at an approximate cost of $300, Legal representation and advice at a cost of approximately $400, business licenses $100, $1000 for CPA services, and the remaining $200 will be spent on Anime and hoola hoops. (Just making sure you are still paying attention!)

<h3><strong>Who we are:</strong></h3>
<p>For 54 years, the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Weld County, has been serving youth ages 6 to 18 years old in after school and summer programming. Our mission is to inspire and enable all youth, especially those who need us most, to become productive, responsible and caring citizens. We accomplish this for a membership fee only $10 per school year and $10 per summer for each child or teen. Our areas in which we provide activities in are: Academic Success, Good Character &amp; Citizenship, Healthy Lifestyles, and The Arts. On average we see over 525 kids per day during the school year. During the summer this number will be nearly 700 youth members in total at 8 our facilities! We expect 60 of these youth to be active members of our Teen Center located in Greeley, Colorado.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The teens we serve:</strong></h3>
<p>Teen programming is geared towards academic success and community engagement. We have several local partnerships to support college and career preparation. <i><strong>Our teens are also highly engaged within the community, and have been nominated for 5 awards at the national level from the Boy &amp; Girls Clubs of America! </strong></i></p>

<p>Sending them on this college trip encourages them to realize their dreams. When you invest in our youth, you are showing them that all of their hard work will pay off and that you personally believe in them.</p>
<p>You would be surprised how powerful a small investment of encouragement can alter the path of a single youth. We appreciate your support!</p>

<ul style=""list-style-type:circle;""><li>Airfare and lodging in a select region of the US – Current options include:<ul><li>Northeast United States / Northern California-Utah-Nevada / Hawaii</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<ul style=""list-style-type:circle;""><li>Campus Visits to at least 5 Universities</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;""> </p>
<ul style=""list-style-type:circle;""><li>Educational Tours and Site Seeing         </li></ul>
<p>For the duration of this campaign, our teens will be putting together the plan for their trip including planning for costs, transportation, sightseeing locations, and overall logistics! </p>
<p><i><u>Stay tuned for more details!</u></i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why:</h3>
<p>Think about your life and all of the things that you've accomplished or places you've been... Or maybe think about what you wish you were able to do or places you wanted to go...</p>
<p>Now put yourself in the shoes of a group of local teens that have barely begun to see the world outside of Northern Colorado, a group of teens who have faced substantial struggle in their lives. Your support will give our youth the courage, confidence and motivation to creatively explore their dreams.</p>
<p>Remember, these teens are our future and will soon become the young adult leaders in our community. It is crucial that we invest in them now because they are the ones that are going to shape the world for many years to come.</p>

</div></div>","Who we are:
For 54 years, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Weld County, has been serving youth ages 6 to 18 years old in after school and summer programming. Our mission is to inspire and enable all youth, especially those who need us most, to become productive, responsible and caring citizens. We accomplish this for a membership fee only $10 per school year and $10 per summer for each child or teen. Our areas in which we provide activities in are: Academic Success, Good Character & Citizenship, Healthy Lifestyles, and The Arts. On average we see over 525 kids per day during the school year. During the summer this number will be nearly 700 youth members in total at 8 our facilities! We expect 60 of these youth to be active members of our Teen Center located in Greeley, Colorado.
 
The teens we serve:
Teen programming is geared towards academic success and community engagement. We have several local partnerships to support college and career preparation. Our teens are also highly engaged within the community, and have been nominated for 5 awards at the national level from the Boy & Girls Clubs of America! 

Sending them on this college trip encourages them to realize their dreams. When you invest in our youth, you are showing them that all of their hard work will pay off and that you personally believe in them.
You would be surprised how powerful a small investment of encouragement can alter the path of a single youth. We appreciate your support!

<p>The Summer Sizzzle BVI group are joining efforts to support the rebuilding of the largest public high school in the British Virgin Islands. In September of 2017, Hurricane Irma brought devastation to the BVI, destroying or severely damaging nearly all buildings. Amongst the havoc left by Irma was the destruction of the Elmore Stoutt High School, rendering most of the building unusable just as the island’s students were about to embark on their new school year.</p>
<p>The Summer Sizzle BVI community, would like to raise enough money to assist families to provide school supplies to students to help in the restoration of Elmore Stoutt High School so that students can return to their normal day-to-day routines and the teachers can continue providing the students with the education they deserve.</p>

I am hoping that many of them will take advantage of this course to perfect their accent so they can be a more accurate model for the next generation.But in addition to teachers, I feel that this course will be very useful to students, especially those majoring in French or those going overseas for Junior Year Abroad or other exchange programs.  Another group of young people who would profit from the course are those going to French speaking countries as an au pair or live-in nanny.Business people who work for international companies with branches in France or other French speaking countries or who actually work overseas.  Other potential customers include Foreign Service personnel, Actors and singers and especially the many travelers who go to France each year. My mission is to help these people realize their goal of sounding more authentic when speaking French.Funding Needs:I have already spent over $6000 to get this project started.  These expenses include:  
Graphic and Web Design
SEO Search Engine Optimization
Purchase of a new computer
Video and editing expenses of producing the Word of the Week
Advertising design and publication of an ad in four issues of The French Review (Official scholarly review of the American Association of Teachers of French)
 Purchasing booth space at the annual convention of that organization
A direct mail campaign

And various printing expenses

I will definitely need financial help to complete the project.  The requested funding will pay for the production and editing of the videos of the course material, printing of the dvds and further marketing outreach.  Other Ways You Can Help 
Get the word out!   Whether you can contribute monetarily or not, please  share
 this campaign on all your social media outlets. Tell your friends, family, and anyone you know of who 
might be interested in Mastering French Pronunciation or in supporting me in this effort. Small amounts from
 lots of people can make this project a huge success! Let's make it to 
the goal so that the Mastering French course can be as great as it can be and so 
people around the world will hear about it!  Thank you for your generous support!",0.0,3,"1 Campaign

We are also budding artists, activists, and volunteers. We are carrying on the tradition of Expeditionary Learning where you gain the most by going out into the real world, fearlessly, knowing that you have a safety net in the beautiful, unique individuals surrounding you. We are jokesters, to tell the truth, but when it comes to identifying and solving the problems of today’s world, I don’t believe there is group of teenagers more passionate, courageous, and inventive than the class of 2016. We are your neighbors, relatives, customers, future employees, and maybe complete strangers, but we are friends. We are the supportive voices of the future, and we need your help.</p><h3>What is Junior Journey?</h3><p>The mission of the Junior Journey is to involve CBHS juniors in a one-week, cross-cultural learning experience that will expand students’ sense of both their world and who they are through service and adventure learning. Previous CBHS students and staff have travelled to Biloxi, Mississippi and Almost Heaven, West Virginia to document the journeys of residents whose lives have been impacted by the BP Oil Spill and Hurricane Katrina, as well as participating in service projects with Habitat for Humanity to help rebuild their communities. This year, over the week of April 12-18, the class of 2016 is going to Rockaway, New York, a community that was devastated by Hurricane Sandy and is still in the process of rebuilding itself. In addition to this service project, juniors will learn how to tell powerful stories through documentary in a process that includes interviewing area residents from our Expeditionary Learning partner school in Red Hook, New York and compiling oral histories to draw on and learn from the life experiences of others. </p><p>Former Junior Journey participants say:</p><p> “Although I am only 18, Junior Journey is, and I believe will always be, one of the most influential and life changing moments of my life.”</p><p>“Seeing the inside of her [the interviewee’s] home was very humbling to me, but knowing that the rain won't leak through her ceiling because of the roof that I helped build for her is very inspiring.”</p><p>“I always took my class for granted before, but now I realize just how amazing and unique each and every individual who was on the experience with me truly is.” </p><h3>Why do we need money?</h3><p>Buses, shelter, food... There are many things that go into getting 91 students from Portland, Maine to Rockaway, New York, and back. And our teachers have not been shy about telling us the rule: no funds, no trip.

The entire trip will cost about $50,000, a generous amount of which has already been covered by a combination of grants, local fundraisers, and parent contributions. However, we still have a ways to go, and are nowhere near where we need to be. As I mentioned, any amount is graciously appreciated, and if you would like we have a couple of perks available, including a complete DVD disc drive of our documentaries once they are finished, a limited edition class of 2016 Junior Journey t-shirt, and a thank you shoutout at one of our infamous school meetings. Feel free to contact us with any questions about money and donations.</p><h3>Why should you care?</h3><p>Because you know us. Well, you most likely don’t know all of us, but we are high school students, and you probably know some of those. You know how hard it is for high schoolers to learn in traditional settings, both socially and academically. And Casco Bay High School’s Junior Journey is an amazing opportunity for students to put themselves out there and learn from the real world and real people, fostering real friendships along the way. You know what it’s like to feel excited and inspired about the future of the world, and you care about exciting and inspiring youth, and giving the next generation an educational experience that will help shape them into motivated, intelligent leaders of tomorrow.</p><h3>How can you help?</h3>Besides donating the obvious way, we could use your help to spread the word about our campaign.

<p></p>

<p>The Jericho Orphanage Home is a licensed Orphanage founded by Kabalo in 2010. It presently hosts 18 children aged 7 – 15. Kabalo was 23 when he took a private initiative to help the first, small child in 2008. Now there are 18 children that Kabalo and we volunteers take care of – and not space enough in the old house, which is only 90 sqm (three rooms).</p></span></div>
<h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Kabalo's mission</span></h3>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><p>Kabalo's mission is to give children the same chance as
he got, when his father died. He was 12 and brought to an Orphanage. Deeply
grateful for the care and education he got there, he has made it his mission to
help children, empower them and coach them to become productive members of society. He believes
this is done through rehabilitation, education and teaching them selfreliance
skills. </p>
<p>To absorb knowledge, however, you have to have a secure
base - a functioning home, and that is why this project is so important to us. The
future of our children depends on it.</p></span></div>
<h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Kabalo's story: Why the Jericho Orphanage was founded</span></h3>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If you have watched the video, you will already know about Kabalo and his past.  If not, then here is a story that will touch your hearts:</span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Kabalo is 29 years old. He is
educated veterinarian, and his former job was tutoring vet students in college. Kabalo lost his father when he was 12 years old, and due to their economy, the
mother had to send Kabalo to an orphanage. The orphanage took care of him, and
is the reason, that he was able to attend school and get an education. The tutoring gave a good salary, but Kabalo wished to pay back to community in
gratitude for the chance he had been given.</span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">When Kabalo was 22 years old, he took in his first orphaned kid,
James. James was 6</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> years and albino – as were his parents. Some people in Tanzania believe that if
you kill an albino, you will receive luck and fortune, and James had lost both
his parents to this belief.</span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The second child that entered Kabalo's home was Neema, 9 years old. Both her parents had
died of HIV and she was left without anyone else.</span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The number of children increased, and the government advised Kabalo to get an
orphanage permit. He recieved the permit in 2010, when he was 25 years old, and that marked the beginning of Jericho
Orphanage home.</span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Kabalo now had a home full of kids he had to take care of, and it did not work
out with a full time job. He decided to sacrifice his job and dedicated himself
100% to the children.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">He now had two rents to pay (his own house and the house where the children lived) plus food, clothes, books, school etc. for the kids, and no job. To get a bit of an income, he decided to grow crops to sell and live from. As the years passed by, the number of kids kept increasing and we house 18 kids at the moment.</span></div>

<h3>The NEW Jericho Orphanage Home</h3>
<div>
<p>Kabalo took a big decision in 2014 and sold his car to
buy a piece of land outside the city, where a new and better orphanage home is
being built. </p>
<p>Since Kabalo owns the land, the new orphanage will not
have to pay rent and more of the little resources we have, can be used for
taking care of the children – so they can get better food and have the things
they need to attend school.</p>
<p>The new orphanage home will have better of space and
make it possible for everybody, kids, volunteers and Kabalo to stay with each
others 24/7. It is modest in western terms – but for us and the children a big
improvement.</p>
<p>It is situated outside the city with open fields and a
big garden and we are planning also to have some domestic animals, such as cows
and chickens, and make a vegetable garden on the estate to teach the kids how
to be selfprovided.</p>

</div></div>","The team 
Allow me start by introducing the team behind the NEW Jericho Orphanage Home. It currently consists of three members:
Kabalo, 29, Tanzania. Kabalo is the founder and coordinator of Jericho Orphanage Home .Lara, 22, Iceland. Volunteer. Responsible for budget, income and expenses. Lara has worked with Kabalo for 6 months helping out with the children and started planning the new orphanage with him.Emilie, 19, Denmark. Volunteer. Newcomer and touched by the initiative and big hearts of Kabalo - and initiator of this crowdfunding


The Jericho Orphanage Home is a licensed Orphanage founded by Kabalo in 2010. It presently hosts 18 children aged 7 – 15. Kabalo was 23 when he took a private initiative to help the first, small child in 2008. Now there are 18 children that Kabalo and we volunteers take care of – and not space enough in the old house, which is only 90 sqm (three rooms).
Kabalo's mission
Kabalo's mission is to give children the same chance as
he got, when his father died. He was 12 and brought to an Orphanage. Deeply
grateful for the care and education he got there, he has made it his mission to
help children, empower them and coach them to become productive members of society. He believes
this is done through rehabilitation, education and teaching them selfreliance
skills. 
To absorb knowledge, however, you have to have a secure
base - a functioning home, and that is why this project is so important to us. The
future of our children depends on it.
Kabalo's story: Why the Jericho Orphanage was founded
If you have watched the video, you will already know about Kabalo and his past.  If not, then here is a story that will touch your hearts:

Kabalo is 29 years old. He is
educated veterinarian, and his former job was tutoring vet students in college. Kabalo lost his father when he was 12 years old, and due to their economy, the
mother had to send Kabalo to an orphanage. The orphanage took care of him, and
is the reason, that he was able to attend school and get an education. The tutoring gave a good salary, but Kabalo wished to pay back to community in
gratitude for the chance he had been given.


When Kabalo was 22 years old, he took in his first orphaned kid,
James. James was 6 years and albino – as were his parents. Some people in Tanzania believe that if
you kill an albino, you will receive luck and fortune, and James had lost both
his parents to this belief.


The second child that entered Kabalo's home was Neema, 9 years old. Both her parents had
died of HIV and she was left without anyone else.


The number of children increased, and the government advised Kabalo to get an
orphanage permit. He recieved the permit in 2010, when he was 25 years old, and that marked the beginning of Jericho
Orphanage home.


Kabalo now had a home full of kids he had to take care of, and it did not work
out with a full time job. He decided to sacrifice his job and dedicated himself
100% to the children.

He now had two rents to pay (his own house and the house where the children lived) plus food, clothes, books, school etc. for the kids, and no job. To get a bit of an income, he decided to grow crops to sell and live from. As the years passed by, the number of kids kept increasing and we house 18 kids at the moment.
  
The NEW Jericho Orphanage Home

Kabalo took a big decision in 2014 and sold his car to
buy a piece of land outside the city, where a new and better orphanage home is
being built. 
Since Kabalo owns the land, the new orphanage will not
have to pay rent and more of the little resources we have, can be used for
taking care of the children – so they can get better food and have the things
they need to attend school.
The new orphanage home will have better of space and
make it possible for everybody, kids, volunteers and Kabalo to stay with each
others 24/7. It is modest in western terms – but for us and the children a big
improvement.
It is situated outside the city with open fields and a
big garden and we are planning also to have some domestic animals, such as cows
and chickens, and make a vegetable garden on the estate to teach the kids how
to be selfprovided.
We wish to make
our orphanage more attractive to volunteers who want to explore another culture
and way of living, and at the same time do something great for those who need
it. Therefore the new orphanage will also provide improved accomodation for our
volunteers from all around the world.



We want to give our children a second chance. Many of
them grew up on the streets with nobody to take care of them or help them
through life. They have faced challenges and situations, that no child should
ever have to be near, and we believe more than anything, that these kids
deserve a new chance in life. That is why we wish to create a safe environment for our kids, so they can focus their energy on studying and not on surviving. 
A project like this costs
money, and that is something that few has enough of here. We therefore ask for
your help.



What we need & what you get 
We need 17.000 dollars to cover all the building
expenses. Of this money 14.000 dollars provide us with bricks, cement, wood,
stones, water.
3.000 dollars cover toilet, sink, doors and windows. Payment to the workers are
included.
We are presently funding the building with our own
little supplies and hope to move all children in March 2015.
Are you in doubt of whether you want to contribute or not? - Here are some
numbers to take into consideration:
If we reach more than our goal, the spare money will
provide clothes, food, books, inventory, education and entertainment for the
children.


All kids go to school - and here is how big a
difference very little can do:
- 
A full school

-  School books for one child - 1,50 USD
-  Food for a day (three meals) - 3,50 USD
-

Little can mean a lot. For many years Kabalo has spent
all his time and money to care for the kids.
Let’s give the New Jericho Orphanage Home even better possibilities to raise and empower these children.

</div></div>","The Rundown

I'm Adam Nicholson. I'm a writer and artist, teacher, and community arts organizer, and I am launching a project to help artists connect with each other and the world, hone their skills, and make an independent living doing what they love.
Enter Sala Creative Association.
(Sala, to its friends)
Sala is designed to help musicians, writers, visual and performing artists, and creatives of all types place and sell their work; find employers, clients, and patrons; connect with other creatives in their field and all fields; develop professionally; master their craft; and engage in arts discourse.
I come from Springfield, Illinois, a city of amazing creative energy in the heart of so-called ""flyover country."" Springfield, like most places on Earth, is somewhat removed from major metropolitan creative centers, but in the twenty-first century, distance should be a trivial concern. And talent lives everywhere. As an association, Sala will be based online, connecting creatives from Springfield to Paris to everywhere with contacts and resources from all over, as well aswith each other — and in doing so, will connect great creative work to the world.
I am currently talking with web developers and planning the buildout of a powerful website collecting creative development, marketing, and networking resources in one place. Sala's Indiegogo campaign is live now, and with complete funding, the website should be ready for early access later this year and general availability by early 2016.

I see potential energy that I want to help turn into kinetic energy. I have known successful artists, and I have also known talented and ambitious artists with no strong sense for what steps to take after the creative work is done. Many of the most creative people aren’t always equipped for the ""left brain"" business of making a living from their creative work.
Meanwhile, the creative landscape is changing. Whereas before, gatekeepers like galleries, labels, and publishers presented something of an obstacle to artists — especially those with unique talents and visions outside the mainstream — today, with the right help and tools, creatives can be masters of their own destiny. Sala seeks to ensure creatives get those tools and that help.
It all starts with a website: a space where creatives can sell and showcase their work; build and host professional CVs and portfolios; seek out paying work and have work seek them; learn from the best and lend their own unique expertise and perspective in the areas they know and love. I hope you'll help make this all possible by giving to the cause at igg.me/at/sala and spreading the word. With your support, Sala will help to make creative work a more viable living, and help creativity live! Why?

Due to heavy mixing with the Spanish invaders in the early colonial period, the Guaiquerí have ostensibly lost all material connection with their pre-colonial ancestors. This could be a harrowing case for identity formation considering that material culture has been deemed fundamental to the development of collective identities, however, Guaiqueríes maintain a strong ethnic identity, expressed most notably in political organizations on the island.

The case of the Guaiqueríes has already been cursorily explored in my BA thesis, but requires comparison with other case studies as well as more work on Margarita before any definitive conclusions can be reached.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495094503/rjduvwjgyhbe5ovjot5x.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>For my BA thesis, I conducted two seasons of interviews and museum studies on Margarita in the attempt to establish if Guaiqueríes indeed had lost material continuity with their pre-colonial ancestors, and if so, what effect this had on their identity formation.

An important community aspect is also planned, in the form of informative written and audiovisual materials that will be designed for the community’s different age groups (adults and schoolchildren), the inhabitants of Margarita Island at large as well as visiting tourists. I plan to also conduct workshops uncovering other vestiges of Guaiquerí identity, materially (through archaeological digs) and orally (through focus groups and meetings). Finally, in the further future, I also plan to undertake comparative trans-national work on the Dutch island of Bonaire among the afro-Bonairean inhabitants of the town of Rincón, descendants of 19th-century enslaved salt rakers, to obtain a distinct comparative account of similar processes in the Southeastern Caribbean.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495027555/rw6mxxtjnr0hm5yb2ifh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2><p>The result of this research will be a fresh theoretical approach to understanding post-colonial identities (particularly their relationship to material culture) as well as novel work among the communities of the Southeastern Caribbean in an attempt to understand and manage colonial legacies with these communities themselves.

With a passion for archaeology, especially in my troubled home of Venezuela, and the Caribbean at large, I have dedicated my bachelor’s thesis as well as my upcoming Master's to the Guaiquerí ethnic group from Margarita Island in Venezuela. I spent my youth in Venezuela, graduating from Colegio Interacional de Caracas in 2013 with an IB diploma. In 2016, I finished a BA in Human Interaction, with a minor in Archaeology at Leiden University College, in The Hague. Since 2016 I have been a researcher associated to the Unidad de Estudios Arqueologicos, Universidad Simon Bolivar, Venezuela. This year I got accepted into Cambrige and Oxford for a MPhil in Archaeology, and I've picked Cambridge due to it being a 1 year program, and the faculty and program being better. Please help me  go to Cambridge University and continue this research!My ResearchMy research thus far has focused on the relationship between ethnic identity and material culture among the Guaiquerí ethnic group of Margarita Island, Venezuela.

I was initially introduced into the community by anthropologist Ayala Lafée-Wilbert, who has pioneered work among and authored important books about the little known Guaiqueríes[1] , particularly from the community in El Poblado, Porlamar, Margarita.

<p>In 1994 the Sons of Confederate Veterans placed a Southern Cross of Honor on the Mississippi grave of Silas Chandler, a black man.</p>
<p>By honoring Silas, the SCW helped transform a hazy story about an obscure slave into a full-blown legend. Films, prints, photos and T-shirts soon followed, all promoting him as a loyal son of the South who became a Confederate soldier, heroically battling Yankees alongside his white owner. High lighting Silas' military career is a way of suggesting that Southern blacks were just as eager as whites to fight back against the invaders. It is a position consistent with the belief that the war did not ignite over slavery but over predatory Northern acts.</p>
<p>The discovery of a letter from newly inaugurated President Abraham Lincoln to the governor of Florida has generated renewed interest in Lincoln's views toward slavery.</p>
<p>The letter, found at the Lehigh County Historical Society in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a form letter from Lincoln to Governor Madison S. Perry transmitting ""an authenticated copy of a Joint Resolution to amend the Constitution of the United States."" On March 16, 1861, Lincoln sent the same letter to all of the governors of the states, including states that had already seceded from the Union and formed their own confederate government. What was the Corwin Amendment and what was Lincoln's role in its attempted ratification.</p>
<p>Lincoln was telling the South, ""Just come back to the union and you can keep your slaves forever.” Lincoln was going into panic mode with all that cotton money walking away, one state at a time. What we were told in school, that the Civil War was over slavery, is an outright lie.</p>
<p>The Cross of Honor, created in 1900 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, was intended for Confederates who performed acts of valor on the battlefield, and the award was recently bestowed on soldiers descended from Confederate veterans. So what role did Silas and other slaves really play in the war, and why did he choose to fight for the South?</p>
<p>One thing is clear. Ever since the SCV posthumously honored Silas, a body servant who accompanied his white master into service, accounts of black Confederate troops have surged in popularity, with some now claiming that upwards of 100,000 blacks fought willingly in Southern ranks.</p>
<p>My name is Gregory Newson i’m an artist/writer and a descendant of former slaves from Jacksonville, Florida, my mother migrated north where i was born in New York’s Harlem Hospital. I started drawing and painting in a racially charge atmosphere at age nine way before I could read or write.</p>
<p>I hope what artist’s do is clear to everyone;  We embrace and bring attention to a subject or provoke thought. My journey started back when I did a painting of a black Confederate soldier from pure imagination that instigated a conversations from my Afro-American friends, they voiced an opinion; “Southern slaves were just stupid like (Stepin Fetchit)”. I realized at that moment, there opinion was Influenced by grammar school education, media and Hollywood's portrayal of Southern negroes.</p>
<p>But it was the word ""Stupid"" that disturb me the most as my community embrace the phrase Black Power, I was compelled to seek out a few historians which ignited a passionate search for clarity; “Who was the black Confederates?”</p>
<p>As I pondered the black Confederate soldier in my future study and paintings, I realized this subject had a therapeutic effect on me, I stop feeling like a victim, It was no boogeyman around the corner stopping me from being my own self superhero; No longer was I hearing the cattle call to participate in riots and American historical vandalisms.</p>
<p>Just learning about Anthony Johnson the first registered rich black slave owner in America and the Barbary Wars, where 1.5 million white Christians were held in authentic slavery by Africans blew my mind.</p>
<p>After self publishing, marketing my first book at Civil War reenactments and art shows “Uncle T and the Uppity Spy” attracted hundreds of people thanking me for shedding light on a forbidden history, And surprisingly i was invited to schools to speak about the black Confederates.</p>
<p>I need your help launching my next book named “The wizard and his black hands” it’s about Nathan Bedford Forrest from adolescent to military leader, Fort Pillow and Involvement with reconstruction Klu Klux Klan not the KKK we know today, it's remarkable how much is left out of our education about this American Patriot.  And as someone “me” that was born in a racially-charged environment which did Influence me to hang around the Black Panther Party, I know how Nathan Bedford Forrest’s environment influenced his early life.  I need your financial support to print a 32 page hardcover Y/A edition full color book and to market it to home study families and beyond. They are groups out there that's poorly educated about the Confederacy and Southern people.</p>
<p>I probably cannot do anything to stop historical vandalism,  but with your help we can at least educate the ones that's missing this forbidden history before they become leaders of tomorrow.</p>

I need your help launching my next book named “The wizard and his black hands” it’s about Nathan Bedford Forrest from adolescent to military leader, Fort Pillow and Involvement with reconstruction Klu Klux Klan not the KKK we know today, it's remarkable how much is left out of our education about this American Patriot.  And as someone “me” that was born in a racially-charged environment which did Influence me to hang around the Black Panther Party, I know how Nathan Bedford Forrest’s environment influenced his early life.  I need your financial support to print a 32 page hardcover Y/A edition full color book and to market it to home study families and beyond. They are groups out there that's poorly educated about the Confederacy and Southern people.
I probably cannot do anything to stop historical vandalism,  but with your help we can at least educate the ones that's missing this forbidden history before they become leaders of tomorrow.

Po pitanju imigracije, favorizira <i>slobodu kretanja</i>. U pogledu kulture on uzdiže <i>toleranciju</i>.

      Champion Dreams Productions is not only a Branding, Production and Design company but we are also a lifestyle company as well. We have completed various projects for a variety of individuals and companies while being in business for 6 years. We are looking to raise 1 million dollars in 365 days! A percentage of the funds will be raised for multiple scholarships for the youth. This initiative  is very important to us because it allows us to bless others during our journey plus give back in a major way to be able to assist them with the pursuit of their dreams. 
 

What We Need & What You Get

The goal is to raise 1 million dollars in 365 days. 
For your donation you will receive a Champion Dreams Collectors Trophy Pin. 

 

The Impact

Our fundraising scholarship initiative is very important to us. It enables us to give opportunities to other individuals to be able to capture their dreams through higher learning. 
We have never done a fundraising project like this but we believe we will reach our goal with your help!

 

Risks & Challenges

This initiative is already a challenge for us because we have never asked for funding before, so the fact that we are asking for your help is a challenge. 
We are always up for a challenge and we believe that this 1 Million Dollar goal is a great challenge that we believe that we can achieve.
