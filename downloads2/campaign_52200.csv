In a sport that is traditionally very white, there has been an under-representation of black players in roller derby, and this film follows the team’s preparation for the 2014 Roller Derby World Cup in Dallas.</p><p>From what started as an in-joke to an official entry, this documentary follows the characters, stories, determination and teamwork in the build-up to Dallas. With over 30 countries competing, and many with trained elite athletes from around the world, Team West Indies is very much the underdog.</p><p>As roller derby is relatively unknown in the West Indies, the team come from various parts of the UK and the USA, and all of West Indian heritage. They have mixed and diverse backgrounds, from a white girl born in Jamaica and brought up in the Bahamas to the full-blooded Jamaican who has spent her whole life in the UK. This film follows the lives of skaters, ‘DisorderLee’, ‘SheRarr’, ‘Jobson’, ‘Rammit’ and ‘Attack’ on their journey to Dallas where it’s as much about defining their identity as it is about training their minds and bodies for the competition ahead.</p><p>We are fundraising to complete this film and offer you the chance to help this story reach a broader audience.</p><p>After filming in London, Birmingham, Croydon, Manchester, Sheffield, Swansea and Dallas, we are now reaching the final stages of production and aim to have this project finished by the end of 2020. This last stage is crucial and will determine the future of the project. The majority of the funds collected will be for the hefty post-production costs.</p><p>Once the film is completed, it will be sent to film and documentary festivals before being shared to the general public.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597095017/lbw2dtgc2bpae46v8oqx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>What is Roller Derby?</h3><p>Roller Derby is a full contact women’s sport played on quad skates on a flat oval track. Originating in America, it is currently the fastest-growing women’s sport in the world. In the UK alone it has gone from zero to more than 100 teams in the fourteen years since it arrived.</p><p><u>The rules:</u></p><p>Roller derby is played on an oval flat track.<br/>Two 30 minutes halves are split into jams, and each jam lasts up to two minutes.<br/>Jammers are marked by a star on their helmets, and they start behind the blockers<br/>Jammers earn one point every time they pass a member of the opposing team.<br/>The blockers will try to stop the opposing jammers getting through the pack, while trying to help their own jammer getting through.<br/>Any skater who performs an illegal act gets 30 seconds in the penalty box.<br/>The team with the most points at the end of the game wins</p><p> </p><h3>The Characters</h3><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0""><tbody><tr>

During various interviews, they share about their connections to their West-Indian heritage and the influence it has on their sense of identity. They talk about what this full contact sport has brought in their life and the impact of training on their family and work life.</p><p> </p><h3>Why?</h3><p>Ever since I heard about the creation of this team, I felt inspired to follow this incredible story.

In a sport that is traditionally very white, there has been an under-representation of black players in roller derby, and this film follows the team’s preparation for the 2014 Roller Derby World Cup in Dallas.From what started as an in-joke to an official entry, this documentary follows the characters, stories, determination and teamwork in the build-up to Dallas. With over 30 countries competing, and many with trained elite athletes from around the world, Team West Indies is very much the underdog.As roller derby is relatively unknown in the West Indies, the team come from various parts of the UK and the USA, and all of West Indian heritage. They have mixed and diverse backgrounds, from a white girl born in Jamaica and brought up in the Bahamas to the full-blooded Jamaican who has spent her whole life in the UK. This film follows the lives of skaters, ‘DisorderLee’, ‘SheRarr’, ‘Jobson’, ‘Rammit’ and ‘Attack’ on their journey to Dallas where it’s as much about defining their identity as it is about training their minds and bodies for the competition ahead.We are fundraising to complete this film and offer you the chance to help this story reach a broader audience.After filming in London, Birmingham, Croydon, Manchester, Sheffield, Swansea and Dallas, we are now reaching the final stages of production and aim to have this project finished by the end of 2020. This last stage is crucial and will determine the future of the project. The majority of the funds collected will be for the hefty post-production costs.Once the film is completed, it will be sent to film and documentary festivals before being shared to the general public.What is Roller Derby?Roller Derby is a full contact women’s sport played on quad skates on a flat oval track. Originating in America, it is currently the fastest-growing women’s sport in the world. In the UK alone it has gone from zero to more than 100 teams in the fourteen years since it arrived.The rules:Roller derby is played on an oval flat track.Two 30 minutes halves are split into jams, and each jam lasts up to two minutes.Jammers are marked by a star on their helmets, and they start behind the blockersJammers earn one point every time they pass a member of the opposing team.The blockers will try to stop the opposing jammers getting through the pack, while trying to help their own jammer getting through.Any skater who performs an illegal act gets 30 seconds in the penalty box.The team with the most points at the end of the game wins The Characters

 The StyleWhile we follow the team’s preparation for the biggest competition of their derby career in the 6 months leading up to it, we get to know some of the team members. During various interviews, they share about their connections to their West-Indian heritage and the influence it has on their sense of identity. They talk about what this full contact sport has brought in their life and the impact of training on their family and work life. Why?Ever since I heard about the creation of this team, I felt inspired to follow this incredible story. The more I got to know the team members, the more I wanted to hear their individual stories. Who’d lived in the West Indies? Who had visited?

Des femmes s'affirmant dans ce sport de contact, des mères trouvant un équilibre entre l'entraînement et la vie à la maison, la positivité sur la vision du corps dans une communauté où avoir de grosses cuisses est une fierté, des inconnues se liant autour de la culture antillaise, et un héritage partagé dont elles prenaient conscience au cours de leur aventure.Équipe de réalisation du documentaire On the Road to Dallas a été réalisé et filmé par Mathilde Marinet avec l'aide de Hazel Palmer, toutes les deux professionnelles de la télévision et patineuses de roller derby. Cela donne au public un regard d'initié sur ce sport alternatif qui est bien plus que le jeu lui-même.Le film sera monté par Irène Sinou, artiste et cinéaste et Léo Bodelle, monteur et graphiste. La vision poétique d’Irène apportera une nouvelle dimension à ce projet aux multiples angles tandis que le tranchant de Léo apportera un rythme explosif à ce documentaire. Répartition du budgetNotre objectif de financement participatif est de £2000.Notre objectif initial lors de la première campagne était de £8 000, et nous en avons atteint 58%, soit £4 240 après les frais de la plateforme Indiegogo.Cette somme ne couvre que les coûts finaux de cette production et ne représente qu'une fraction du budget. Jusqu'à présent, ce film a été produit en volontariat et l'équipe de base a couvert tous les coûts elle-même. Nous avons maintenant besoin de votre aide pour le finaliser et voir ce projet enfin prendre vie et toucher le large public qu'il mérite. Voici la répartition du budget:Derniers mots:Vous ne pourrez peut-être pas tous contribuer, mais cela ne signifie pas que vous ne pouvez pas nous aider ou rejoindre notre aventure!Vous pouvez nous aider en partageant un lien vers cette campagne sur les réseaux sociaux comme Facebook, Twitter, Instagram et dans votre communauté.Merci beaucoup pour votre contribution.Site web: https://ontheroadtodallas.comInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ontheroadtodallas/Facebook: https://fb.me/OntheroadtoDallasdoc* Photos officielles de l'équipe part John Hesse @thejohnhesse",21.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>This is Hally and Lizzie's first professional production outside of an educational setting. This project started as a way for Hally and Lizzie to create their own opportunities when their industry was suffering, but it became much more. A few days before our original shoot date, Hally lost a family member. Suddenly so many things we had written into the script became real in Hally's life and for Lizzie as Hally's friend. The way that we approached the project completely changed as we now had the personal experience with loss and its aftermath. Our film became less about petty hurts and more about deep pain that we experience as humans, how we hurt others, and the perilous climb towards forgiveness.  </p>
<p>Our film is dedicated to Mary Hally Shortall as the importance of her life impacted the direction and performance of our film at every moment. We hope that our film sheds light on the complexities of mental illness while instilling that every life is worth living. </p>

This is Fior Di Fossa; a Renaissance drama & psychological thriller centered around two women, Katherine and Genevieve, who were once best friends but now find themselves at odds because of a supposed affair. After a devastating hardship befalls one of them, old wounds are opened. Can they pick up the pieces and move forward together?
The creators, Hally Smith & Lizzie Sherman, are both 2020 graduates from NYU Tisch, pursuing their art as best as they can in these trying times. As they both graduated into a world unexpected and an industry beyond limited, they are putting their whole hearts and efforts into creating meaningful work for themselves and their peers. Please help this team do what feels impossible in this current environment and donate to their post-production costs. Fior Di Fossa is in the editing stage and will be submitted to film festivals in the new year with your help!

<p><i><strong>Through Stone</strong></i> is a post-apocalyptic thriller about a depressed and suicidal man named Janus who wakes up at the doorsteps of hell. His guide Bryn, a demon masquerading as a woman wearing a blindfold, leads him to a dark cave where the only way Janus can return home is to keep moving forward into the depths...until he confronts the source of his grief.</p>
<p>The inspiration for this story came from my own struggles with mental health after losing my father. My understanding of grief as a universal human experience, yet also a very isolating one, serves as an undercurrent of the narrative and symbolic language of the film. I hope that the feelings of hopelessness, loss, and being lost can be understood and through being understood provide a form of connection for those who may too feel isolated. Ultimately, I want the film to explore the difficulty of finding meaning and connection in the wake of grief. At the same time, <i><strong>Through Stone</strong></i>, is a story of triumph.</p>
<p>This production is the culmination of my experience with and attempts to overcome depression, as well as the personal efforts of each and every member of our amazing and supportive crew! This project would not be possible without your support! </p>

However, he quickly discovered location sound recording and began engrossing himself in student productions. This interest in production gradually transitioned into a desire to learn other aspects of production: specifically, cinematography. Now, he specializes in lighting and cinematography for both short and long-form independent narrative fiction films. You can view his reel below:</p>

<p>Since this film will be shooting entirely on-location in a cave over the winter, a significant portion of our budget will be spent on keeping the cast and crew warm and fed while transporting equipment within the cave area. We'll also be dressing the interior of the cave to fit a surreal and Expressionistic vibe (<i>The Descent</i> meets <i>Eraserhead</i>), so we'll be allocating the next most significant percentage of our funds to art department (set dressing, costume/wardrobe, hair/makeup, special effects, production design). </p>
<p>We'll also be spending the budget on obtaining the highest quality gear possible for our camera, lighting, and sound departments in order to help our amazing and talented crew bring our vision to life on-screen and through the speakers!

Designed by Balagopal S Sahadev (https://www.behance.net/balagopalss)CORE CREW MEMBERSIt is pertinent to point out that crew members formed a year ago and who worked on the first schedule in India have been retained due to their familiarity with nuances of the project. The team members are an eclectic group from diverse cultures mirroring the international spirit of the film.With a successful first schedule behind us, the locations, cast and crew are in place for the second schedule. The second schedule which will complete the film, consists of 10 more scenes to be shot and integrated with the portions shot during the first schedule in India.  Funding for the second schedule is an important milestone to be crossed for the completion of our project.  SPECIAL THANKSWe would also like to express our gratitude to the following organisations whose unstinted support enabled our team to traverse this far in our journey of making this film.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What We Need</h3>

<li>

</ul>
<p>But this is not all we need. Whilst a good chunk of our required stuff is already bought or being donated by friends for free we still need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>More Equipment</u> like camera lenses, gripping items, microphones... sound is important too!</li>
<li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is very difficult for artists to gain experience in the film industry in Australia. The competition is fierce and job vacancies hard to find. The difference this film makes to those involved, especially those who have not worked on a professional short film project before, is huge. The finished film will act as proof to future potential employers that the crew member has the skills to make a quality product, that they understand the workings of a fiction films' production process. It will serve to reinforce long-term connections in the industry with people just like them; photographers, producers, actors, gaffers, sound techs, grips, painters, videographers, and the list goes on. It will serve to open them up to new skills they may not have thought of before. The possibilities are endless!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Any arts project, especially the highly collaborative art of film making, comes to a point were it is like a revving race-car on the start line. There are risks and challenges involved. Every turn requires adaptation, decisiveness, and calculation. These are overcome with know-how, determination, and ambition... which we are filled to the brim with.</p>
<p>We are rearing to race, we just need the fuel.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We as artists can certainly understand that not everyone can financially contribute to the success of this crowdfunding campaign. By you can help by sharing it with your friends, family, and everyone who happens to pass you by!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The voluntourism industry was under fire for the past decade for becoming more about the volunteers experiences than actually helping the communities. Now, in the midst of the COVID19 pandemic the travel industry as a whole has come to a stop. A travel reset movement has started in order to give the volunteer travel industry a chance to be reborn. This documentary film series, MISSION follows the journey of this travel reset movement.</p>
<p>This series will showcase communities in which voluntourism is incredibly popular. It will chronicle the volunteers’ and locals’ struggles during the pandemic, and discover what the future holds for the voluntourism organizations and the communities they aim to serve. </p>
<p>The Director/DP <strong>Melissa Pratt</strong>  completed her BFA in Film and Television with a concentration in cinematography and a minor in documentary at DePaul University. She has shot many films, music videos, and documentaries.</p>
<p>In high school, I attended a one-week mission trip every year for 5 years. As well as a service immersion trip my first year of college. As each year passed, while going on those trips, the question kept coming up: Am I actually helping these communities by going on this trip?</p>
<p>That is why I feel personally driven to make this documentary. I want to question these service organizations, and to live in these communities to figure out if they are getting the help they need. Also, I want to see how these organizations are planning to start back up after the travel ban due to the pandemic.</p>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
</div><div>
<p>In order to film the first and begin the second episode, we will need $10,000 to cover the costs of production including things like travel, lodging, transportation, equipment, COVID 19 safety precautions, as well as post production and editing costs.</p>
<p>The first episode will take place in Nepal, where we will get a follow up interview with Claire Bennett (post pandemic) as well as capture the community's perspective, volunteer organizations perspective and other travel specialists perspective on these changing times within the voluntourism and travel industry. It will also include traveling to interview Julia Green and Sydney Yelton in order to hear about how the travel reset movement got started and what their plans are for the future of the movement. </p>
<p>The perks you will get if you donate are a thank you postcard, A knick knack from the travels, a kindle edition of the book: <i>Learning Service: the essential guide to volunteering abroad </i>or a signed by Claire Bennett paperback, an executive producer credit, a call with the Director or the prerelease of episode 1. </p>
<p><strong>All funds raised, no matter if we reach our goal or exceed it will go toward this series. Anything helps make this series possible!</strong></p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This film will shed light on the controversy of voluntourism and educate people on what to look for when it comes to planning their next service trip or act of service. We want people to stop and question the voluntourism and travel companies before putting their money towards projects that are ill-equipped or ignorant to the community's problems and find companies that are actually helping the communities they intend to serve.</p>
<p>The biggest problem in this industry is a lack of accurate information available for those looking to make a positive impact through volunteering. These new volunteers don’t know how to look into the potential downfalls these organizations create within these communities. So the cycle of new, ignorant volunteers putting their spending towards these companies, keeps these organizations prosperous.</p>
<p>This project is timely and urgent because before the pandemic, this was a 173 billion dollar business that is taking advantage of people in need and people who are trying to help, in order to bank off of people’s insecurities and struggles. Now with the COVID 19 vaccine now out, traveling will start to begin again for many people. With this new beginning there is an opportunity for change.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613433503/smgji4wmer6vnbda2jgl.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always problems that can come up when traveling and filmmaking. I will be planning with members of each community I visit to ensure a safe and sustainable trip for each of my travels. Also I plan on taking all the precautions to ensure everyone included in this production is healthy and safe. I will be getting tested as regularly as possible and quarantining in each country before any filmmaking begins. </p>

<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p>Wilted is short drama film about Kairan and Jasmine, a couple who have suffered a devastating tragedy that has changed them and left them and their relationship both scarred and ... wilted. The strain and guilt over their loss lay the foundation to a pathway of multiple forms of abuse including: physical, emotional, mental, sexual, and financial. This is Kairan’s story.</p>
<p><strong>Who I am and why I need your support</strong></p>
<p>My name is Liane Moonraven. I am an American filmmaker, now living in England for the past two and a half years. In 2018, between February and November, I wrote and produced five short, self-funded films. This year I was prompted to write a script about male-victim domestic violence. All shooting is completed including principle and b-roll. I am raising funds to finish the project, now in post-production. I have never asked for help before, but this time I need your assistance in seeing the film through post-production completion.</p>
<p><strong>From the National Domestic Violence Hotline website:</strong> Domestic violence (also called intimate partner violence (IPV), domestic abuse or relationship abuse) is a pattern of behaviours used by one partner to maintain power and control over another partner in an intimate relationship. Domestic violence includes behaviours that physically harm, arouse fear, prevent a partner from doing what they wish or force them to behave in ways they do not want. It includes the use of physical and sexual violence, threats and intimidation, emotional abuse and economic deprivation. Many of these different forms of domestic violence/abuse can be occurring at any one time within the same intimate relationship.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Wilted will bring much-needed awareness to male-victim domestic violence.  Men are less likely to reveal that they have been victims of domestic abuse because of society's expectation that men shouldn't show emotional vulnerability or ""weakness"". Men often question their manhood or masculinity when being abused by a female domestic (or non-domestic) partner. </p>
<p>Here are some startling facts about male-victim domestic violence. Did you know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domestic abuse affects an estimated 700,000 male victims every year.</li>
<li>Men are less likely to be victims of domestic violence, but they are also less likely to talk about it.</li>
<li>Male victims are over three times as likely as women to keep their abuse a secret, or refuse to tell the police or medical professionals.</li>
<li>15% of men aged 16 to 59 have experienced some form of domestic abuse since the age of 16, equivalent to an estimated 2.4 million male victims.</li>
<li>For every three victims of domestic abuse, one will be male.</li>
<li>One in six to seven men suffer from domestic abuse in their lifetime.</li>
<li>In 2017, Jordan Worth, was the first woman in the UK to ever be convicted of male domestic abuse. She has been sentenced to seven and a half years in prison.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Renowned actor/director Adrian Pasdar is back in the director's seat with this hilarious comedy of two English brothers on holiday in New York City, and the cacophony of chance encounters that ensue in Coney Island. Based on the best seller by Lee Henshaw, this is a love letter journey about the value of revelry, relationships and unbeatable stories with existential angst and whip smart dialogue. Actor/Producer Amanda Righetti is partnering with the multiple award winning producer Christopher Martini of Triple Martini Productions. Barry Markowitz is the Director of Photography who has lensed Crazy Heart, Slingblade, All The Pretty Horses... to name a few. Quite simply a national treasure and one of the best cinematographers this world has ever known. With your generous contributions and collaboration we will be able to film our short project, and submit it to film festivals to help generate funding for the full length feature.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $20,000 to rent camera and lighting equipment, hire actors and crew, secure locations and permits, rent costumes and set decorations. If you have ever wanted a poster or script signed, a director chair back with your name on it, or have your name in film credits, this is your opportunity to collaborate and get involved on the ground floor. Lee Henshaw will be signing a limited edition republishing of the book our script is based on, specifically for our campaign. You'll only get this copy if you've contributed to our project. If we don't reach our entire goal, whatever funds we do raise will be used to help film our production. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Milton Berle said, ""Laughter is the best medicine in the world."" In the current dark circumstances of the world, we believe a little laughter can go a long way in giving people reprieve. Our project is in the good directing hands of multiple award winning actor/director Adrian Pasdar. Christopher Martini is a rising producer with 12 award wins for various films and short films throughout the independent film festival circuit. Amanda Righetti is an award winning actress and producer.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We understand the challenges and risks of making a film, and have surrounded ourselves with seasoned professional actors, crew, and producers that have tenacity, passion and dedication to see this project through. We believe the professionals we are engaging to make this film will do whatever it takes to finish it and make it great.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our project emphasizes diversity at the forefront of a blended, all-inclusive cast &amp; crew. Women fulfill key filmmaker roles as screenwriter, director &amp; executive producer. Supportive men stand with them. Love and mental health aren't always mutually exclusive. 'better.' weaves them together in a poetic romance that blossoms as fate intervenes, amidst two pasts that just won't let go.  Our story is based on actual events from the screenwriter's own life and it emphasizes the prevalence of mental health in the lives of people we know, and how it both impacts the person struggling and those around them.  We are using film as the visual medium to express the importance of support and vigilance in addressing mental health, in order to live a productive life both surrounded by love and through loving others.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A modest budget of $54,000 will help us cover the following areas:</p>
<p>$20,000 All actors and Above Line Crew for the entire duration of filming (pay according to scale, some accommodations for out of state key people)</p>
<p>$12,500 All Below Line Crew and Equipment (includes camera/lighting/sound professionals &amp; equipment, crew being hired from film school Alumni, makeup/hair/wardrobe expert and items)</p>
<p>$7000 Locations and Transportation (places to film in, required permits for locations, insurance, and one vehicle rental for getting around Los Angeles at a modest estimate)</p>
<p>$4000 Food (this covers required meals on set for cast and crew for the duration of filming)</p>
<p>$2750 Post Production &amp; Music Rights (editing, post-production sound &amp; music fees for the film)</p>
<p>$2500 Festival Fees, Publicity &amp; Expendables (super modest figure to enter the festival circuit to seek distribution options &amp; to promote the film)</p>
<p>$250 Prop Essentials (we have a few key props that are integral to the story)</p>
<p>8% Administration &amp; Processing fee (rounded down to $4000 for IGG campaign fees of actual 5% figure + contribution processing fee of 2.9% per transaction)</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's a powerful story that will resonate with audiences on a personal level. The characters are relatable and become people you truly care about as the story unfolds. You either know someone just like one or more of them, or you find yourself realizing you can relate yourself. It is an emotional journey that both tugs at your heartstrings and conveys very real consequences.</p>
<p>This isn't a typical perspective regarding mental health conveyed in a film. It elevates film nuances while still providing a well-rounded story that ebbs and flows.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580943090/bcanmnplzpnkvqlglu0p.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Currently, we are in pre-production and attempting to make a full indie feature film on a micro budget. It's a challenging task, considering the cost of making a film. However, we believe this modest budget will still provide us with the essential tools to still tell a valuable story to a good visual standard. </p>
<p>We took on the time and costs of pre-production on our own. The entire team has been a part of the film and television industry and express their individual talents in multiple areas of filmmaking to make this project work. Experienced film school alumni will have the chance to apply their skills on our all-inclusive, diverse crew, as well as additional roles through auditions for LA local actors.  These are important aspects for our film to stand out by providing opportunities to crew and more cast members without boundaries on race, religion or orientation, just people hungry to bring this project to life. </p>
<p>The teaser trailer was filmed so you could get an idea of the story and some of the faces in it but we really need some solid locations to better convey a New York vibe, as well as lighting and sound professionals to make it all come to life to a higher standard and do this story justice. Our budget is incredibly modest, as productions of this calibre tend to come in between $350,000 and $3.5 million. We are still applying for highly competitive grants as well, in hopes to have more funds for  key areas like location rentals and securing music rights. Our crew will remain minimal but at a comfortable number of professionals to make this all happen!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Your support is everything to getting this important story into the world.  Please share this campaign on social media and have conversations with your friends about just how essential it is to have a very real portrait of mental health and relationships on the big screen. Film is a beautiful medium that can touch so many lives and we hope you join us in getting the word out about our story.</p>

Our project emphasizes diversity at the forefront of a blended, all-inclusive cast & crew. Women fulfill key filmmaker roles as screenwriter, director & executive producer. Supportive men stand with them. Love and mental health aren't always mutually exclusive. 'better.' weaves them together in a poetic romance that blossoms as fate intervenes, amidst two pasts that just won't let go.  Our story is based on actual events from the screenwriter's own life and it emphasizes the prevalence of mental health in the lives of people we know, and how it both impacts the person struggling and those around them.  We are using film as the visual medium to express the importance of support and vigilance in addressing mental health, in order to live a productive life both surrounded by love and through loving others.


What We Need & What You Get
A modest budget of $54,000 will help us cover the following areas:
$20,000 All actors and Above Line Crew for the entire duration of filming (pay according to scale, some accommodations for out of state key people)
$12,500 All Below Line Crew and Equipment (includes camera/lighting/sound professionals & equipment, crew being hired from film school Alumni, makeup/hair/wardrobe expert and items)
$7000 Locations and Transportation (places to film in, required permits for locations, insurance, and one vehicle rental for getting around Los Angeles at a modest estimate)
$4000 Food (this covers required meals on set for cast and crew for the duration of filming)
$2750 Post Production & Music Rights (editing, post-production sound & music fees for the film)
$2500 Festival Fees, Publicity & Expendables (super modest figure to enter the festival circuit to seek distribution options & to promote the film)
$250 Prop Essentials (we have a few key props that are integral to the story)
8% Administration & Processing fee (rounded down to $4000 for IGG campaign fees of actual 5% figure + contribution processing fee of 2.9% per transaction)


The Impact
It's a powerful story that will resonate with audiences on a personal level. The characters are relatable and become people you truly care about as the story unfolds. You either know someone just like one or more of them, or you find yourself realizing you can relate yourself. It is an emotional journey that both tugs at your heartstrings and conveys very real consequences.
This isn't a typical perspective regarding mental health conveyed in a film. It elevates film nuances while still providing a well-rounded story that ebbs and flows.


Risks & Challenges
Currently, we are in pre-production and attempting to make a full indie feature film on a micro budget. It's a challenging task, considering the cost of making a film. However, we believe this modest budget will still provide us with the essential tools to still tell a valuable story to a good visual standard. 
We took on the time and costs of pre-production on our own. The entire team has been a part of the film and television industry and express their individual talents in multiple areas of filmmaking to make this project work. Experienced film school alumni will have the chance to apply their skills on our all-inclusive, diverse crew, as well as additional roles through auditions for LA local actors.  These are important aspects for our film to stand out by providing opportunities to crew and more cast members without boundaries on race, religion or orientation, just people hungry to bring this project to life. 
The teaser trailer was filmed so you could get an idea of the story and some of the faces in it but we really need some solid locations to better convey a New York vibe, as well as lighting and sound professionals to make it all come to life to a higher standard and do this story justice. Our budget is incredibly modest, as productions of this calibre tend to come in between $350,000 and $3.5 million. We are still applying for highly competitive grants as well, in hopes to have more funds for  key areas like location rentals and securing music rights. Our crew will remain minimal but at a comfortable number of professionals to make this all happen!


Other Ways You Can Help
Your support is everything to getting this important story into the world.  Please share this campaign on social media and have conversations with your friends about just how essential it is to have a very real portrait of mental health and relationships on the big screen. Film is a beautiful medium that can touch so many lives and we hope you join us in getting the word out about our story.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The film and the story</h3>
<p>DMA International is a film production company connected directly to the author of the novel The Wallenberg Dossier.

<p>Based on a true story and recounting the gestures of Raoul Wallenberg, the man who saved tens of thousands of Jewish families during the Holocaust, many more than Schindler did. An intense, passionate love story and a fast-paced thriller along the river Danube during the Second World War.</p>
<p>A man boarding a plane from Stockholm to New York will recognize a few seats before him the woman he once loved. As the plane crosses the Atlantic he thinks back at Budapest, Hungary, along the  waters of the Danube river, where the two lived an intense love affair and spy story. Sent to Hungary at President’s Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s direct orders, Wallenberg’s actions and courage will help save thousands of Jewish families. Wallenberg will eventually be arrested by Soviet forces entering Budapest and secretly brought to Moscow to face one of the harshest interrogations ever. A few years later Wallenberg will disappear in mysterious circumstances. However, no one knows the young woman he once loved is taking control of his destiny and reaching out to save him.</p>
<p>Based on the dossier ordered by the Nazi secret services to follow each single move of Wallenberg inside and outside the city of Budapest.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign is not only about producing a first rate feature film based on a successful novel. It is about unveiling for the first time to the world the true story of a man who saved many more people than Schindler did and did it at his own life risk. It is a about telling the story of a woman so modern and strong to change the course of history.

It is about the message of becoming our brother's and sister's keepers all over the world. <br/><br/>You are funding a feature film but the production planning encompasses also the filming and the accomplishment of a four-episode documentary, mainly using the film's scenes and distributed to schools, libraries and televisions dedicated to Raoul Wallenberg's life, the Holocaust and WWII.<br/><br/>By funding this film you can be part of an incredible production planning and come to know the skilled professionals that often work behind a film production and are unknown to the grater audience. And above all you can be part of a successful film that will set a difference for the industry and for the audience.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526982176/tae2qt2uuwzu4bwro033.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Wallenberg Dossier, like the novel from which the screenplay is adapted, begins and ends in contemporary times, while the central part of the story is a flashback set in the 1940s during World War II. This is our challenge. The central part of the story is costly to produce, especially the settings and locations. It poses a risk for the production. And this is why we need your funding.<br/>We have overcome this risk by carefully planning alternative shooting scenes, depending on the funding we will obtain. This enables the production to keep the highest quality throughout the film, while reducing the cost and the extent of some scenes.<br/>The production is also committed to solving typical risk factors such as the distribution pattern, the actors and partners involved, by planning different solutions depending on the final budget available. <br/>We are taking our job very seriously and play it transparent: all our funders whether they are Equities or Individuals believing in our project, will be able to follow on a monthly basis all our steps and investments. We aim at convincing all our supporters to invest a second time in our project, by showing them the value we can produce.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our philosophy - The way we work</h3>
<p>DMA International is a young company. Yes, longtime experienced professionals work with us, however we feel that our approach is important: we don’t produce films for us, we share films for all of you.</p>
<p>So, don’t expect our relation with you is finished once you've chosen your perk to back us! Rather, it starts there. From that moment we will consider you part of our team, we will write you regularly about our current and future projects. Occasionally we arrange production parties or roundups around the world that aim at making you feel part of our family and discuss with you your point of view and maybe also your ideas and, of course, also having a glittering evening together.</p>
<p>We want to keep this relation going because we believe that the best ideas often come up like this.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Funding is essential for us. However there are other solutions to help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please word out and make noise about our campaign. </li>
<li>Keep your friends and social media informed by reminding them to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

It is about the message of becoming our brother's and sister's keepers all over the world. You are funding a feature film but the production planning encompasses also the filming and the accomplishment of a four-episode documentary, mainly using the film's scenes and distributed to schools, libraries and televisions dedicated to Raoul Wallenberg's life, the Holocaust and WWII.By funding this film you can be part of an incredible production planning and come to know the skilled professionals that often work behind a film production and are unknown to the grater audience. And above all you can be part of a successful film that will set a difference for the industry and for the audience.

Risks & Challenges
The Wallenberg Dossier, like the novel from which the screenplay is adapted, begins and ends in contemporary times, while the central part of the story is a flashback set in the 1940s during World War II. This is our challenge. The central part of the story is costly to produce, especially the settings and locations. It poses a risk for the production. And this is why we need your funding.We have overcome this risk by carefully planning alternative shooting scenes, depending on the funding we will obtain. This enables the production to keep the highest quality throughout the film, while reducing the cost and the extent of some scenes.The production is also committed to solving typical risk factors such as the distribution pattern, the actors and partners involved, by planning different solutions depending on the final budget available. We are taking our job very seriously and play it transparent: all our funders whether they are Equities or Individuals believing in our project, will be able to follow on a monthly basis all our steps and investments. We aim at convincing all our supporters to invest a second time in our project, by showing them the value we can produce.
 
Our philosophy - The way we work
DMA International is a young company. Yes, longtime experienced professionals work with us, however we feel that our approach is important: we don’t produce films for us, we share films for all of you.
So, don’t expect our relation with you is finished once you've chosen your perk to back us! Rather, it starts there. From that moment we will consider you part of our team, we will write you regularly about our current and future projects. Occasionally we arrange production parties or roundups around the world that aim at making you feel part of our family and discuss with you your point of view and maybe also your ideas and, of course, also having a glittering evening together.
We want to keep this relation going because we believe that the best ideas often come up like this.

<h3>Synopsis - The Squirrel Catcher </h3>
<p>The Squirrel catcher is a BFA Short Film revolving around the themes of Humanity, Love, Community, Urban Nature, and One's own philosophy of Life.</p>
<p>In a time of great change, 1885, Alfred Benson aspires to do more for his city, and for his true love Christine. He has this brilliant idea to bring squirrels into the Boston Common, and with what starts as a romantic gesture becomes a spiritual clutch for himself as the truth of his reality surfaces, it forces him to cope with a new world.</p>

<p><strong>“</strong>I am a Senior at Emerson College, eager to share a story that has been sitting with me since my freshman year. I've written ""The Squirrel Catcher,"" to share an experience of a character that remains in his own world, and has a hard time accepting the truths of his reality. Dreams are the foundation of our heart's desires - and when our hearts are broken, we learn to move on, cope, and reconnect with what may bring back our spirits. It's incredible, the little things that can bring us together. I'm hoping that this film could be one of them.<strong>”</strong></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>Alfred is a lad lost within his own perception of the world, making him unaware of its brutal realities. He is kind-hearted and often by his lonesome. He enjoys the company of others but is sheepish in the way he presents himself. During a time of great change, the greatest change of all for him is learning about his realities truths; the way he copes with it all brings him closer to nature and humanity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Christine</strong>- Played by <i>Ashley Risteen</i></p>

<p>Christine is not only Alfred's love interest but a character that is before her time. Through multiple male-suitors, she provides herself with more than enough to live a full life, and though not morally justified, Christine has her reasons: to work around societies standards and to escape the fear of normalcy that lies in the home she once knew. She is powerful in that she knows how to get what she wants to protect herself. She also is fun and doesn't give a damn.</p>

<h3>My Ireland</h3>
<p>My name is Anthony Monaghan, but everyone calls me Tony. I am originally from Blacksod Bay, County Mayo in the West of Ireland, a gorgeous place. When I was 15, I had no choice but to leave Ireland in search of work abroad. My first job was picking potatoes in England, a place where The Irish weren't very popular at that time. Since then, I've traveled the world and lived in many different places. Eventually, I settled in St. Louis, Missouri where I started a successful masonry company called Irish Construction and raised three daughters. A few years ago, I founded <a href=""http://www.monaghanproductions.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Monaghan Productions, LLC</a> and independently directed and produced the internationally acclaimed documentary, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/rednecksandculchies"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rednecks + Culchies</a>. It took a hard look at the substance abuse problems of the American working class from the perspective of European tradesmen.<br/><br/>I am now setting out to make a new documentary on something I'm very passionate about - my homeland, My Ireland. It will tell my story, but more importantly, the story of countless Irish men and women who, like me, were forced to emigrate to make a living. Since my childhood, Ireland has evolved from being a very poor country to being a very wealthy one. Why then are the Irish still pouring out of Ireland in droves in search of employment just like they did generations ago? Who is to blame? But it is not just the people leaving Ireland who are losing their homes. Homelessness is on the rise as crooked banks and predatory Vulture Funds are kicking people out of their houses, including those of the middle class. My own home in Ireland where I took my daughters for fifteen years was misappropriated. The government and many of the politicians, too corrupt, indifferent or powerless to step in, have stood by and done nothing as lives were, and continue to be, destroyed. The press and media are reluctant to discuss these tragedies, treating them like a taboo subject. <br/><br/>In the making of My Ireland, I will travel across the nation with a film crew and interview Irish people from all walks of life and social classes, from the fisherman to the politician. I want to understand why these social injustices continue and, moreover, why they are tolerated by a people who, for hundreds of years, were known for being unconquered and untamable. By shedding light on these issues I hope to catalyze, if not directly effect, positive and radical change. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Making a film is neither an easy or inexpensive task, and this documentary will be particularly costly. I will be traveling across the Atlantic and all over Ireland with an American film crew for an indefinite period of time. In addition to the travel expenses of myself and my crew, there will be food, accommodations and equipment acquisitions to cover. Once everything is shot, I will have to pay for the lengthy process of post-production as the film is edited. Then comes one of the most expensive phases; the marketing and submission fees can cost as much, if not more, than the production itself. By donating to this fundraiser, you will be supporting a righteous cause, the Irish people. For those who cannot afford to contribute monetarily (and for those who can), please share this fundraiser with the powerful tools of social media. Help me to help my.. your...  our IRELAND!</p>

<p><i>Where It Dwells</i> is an ambitious graduation short film led by MA Film students and industry crew.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Tracking Your Cash</h3>
<p>From our £800 target, the money will be dispensed across various departments. The majority of the funds will go towards location fees (35%) and cast &amp; crew (24%). The rest will cover further production expenses such as catering, props, costume, travel, and consumables.</p>

<p>We want to thank everyone for your time, interest, and contributions. This is an ambitious undertaking and we're excited and invigorated by the challenges we've overcome and the ones that still lie ahead. Even the smallest support from the passionate filmmaking and film-loving communities gives us the ability to make <i>Where It Dwells</i> bigger and better than we could achieve alone.</p>

</div></div>","Erin is a withdrawn and troubled cleaner concealing a dark secret. Returning unaware to a malevolent presence in her home, Erin's trauma obscures the events that take place until she is made to confront the aftermath of that night.
Written and directed by Kayleigh Boyd, and inspired by Hush (2016), The Shining (1980), and Memento (2000), Where It Dwells is a home invasion horror/thriller that explores themes of secrecy and psychological trauma through an ambiguous narrative.
Developed with the support of Screen Academy Scotland and Developmental Producer Vicki Patterson, Where It Dwells is produced by Sunrise Ishimwe and Kayleigh Boyd.
 

Where It Dwells is an ambitious graduation short film led by MA Film students and industry crew. We wanted to create a film with a high production value that we could proudly share with festival audiences; to do this required quality cast, costume, and locations, as well as operating costs such as catering and vehicle hire.
Your support will really help us take Where It Dwells to new heights through the post-production process, and cover these necessary costs. Of course we wouldn't ask for your contributions without offering anything in return; for your financial support we are offering a selection of perks from social media shout outs and your very own credit, to private viewing links, signed props, and more.
Tracking Your Cash
From our £800 target, the money will be dispensed across various departments. The majority of the funds will go towards location fees (35%) and cast & crew (24%). The rest will cover further production expenses such as catering, props, costume, travel, and consumables.

 

 
Kayleigh is a Scottish writer/director with experience in commercials and short films. Taking a year out to study and refine her practice at Screen Academy Scotland, Kayleigh engages in character-driven dramas with dark and psychological influences. Kayleigh is steadily building her short film portfolio with ambitions to direct her first feature film.

Having worked in the Film and Television industry for over ten years, Stuart has received multiple nominations and wins for his work as a director and director of photography. After shooting two features, Bridal Fever and Lankin, as well as many other short films through 2016 and 2017, Stuart decided to further his education by studying a Masters at Screen Academy Scotland, specialising in Cinematography.

Sunrise graduated from the Film and Television Studies course at the University of Glasgow prior to specializing in producing. She has a passion for visual storytelling and aspires to be a producer across the Film, TV, and Gaming industries.

<p>When Megan, a young, independent, want-to-be inventor, accidentally swaps bodies with her cat, all hell breaks loose. For Cecil, it's the last straw!  In a series of hilarious twists and turns, finger pointing, stumbling and general quackery, Cecil finds himself without his coat, seated across the dinner table from a grumpy Grandpa Jack, and with his hope of making his date with his feline flame Celia, fading further into the distance. But then again not everything appears as it may seem.  </p>
<p>It all started one day when my cat said to me...""so you really want to know what we think? "" and the idea was born. Being around cats for most of my life I got to pick up on the details in cats that really make them...well, cat like. They are such incredibly intelligent animals, each one of them with its own strong personality.</p>
<p>The main thing with cats is that so many people can all relate to certain behavioural traits, even if they don't have cats. So even if you aren't currently owned by a cat, this film is still something that you can relate to and enjoy. </p>

<p>Why £16,000?  </p>
<p>We believe that if we are going to do something, we should do it right and not take the easiest, cheapest route as it is unfair to the cast and crew and unfair to you, our investors and supporters. We want to bring you, and our audience, the best film we possibly can. </p>
<p>Not only will we need to cover <strong>Locations</strong> , <strong>Cast,</strong> <b>Set Design,</b> <strong>Transportation</strong>,<strong> Insurance</strong>, <strong>Editing</strong>, <strong>Perk </strong><b>Fulfilment</b>, (and enough prawns to keep our main star happy), we believe that people should be rewarded for their hard work and passion, and we are not fans of offering      so-called ""exposure"" in exchange for peoples hard work. </p>
<p>To ensure you get a beautiful and fun film that is made to the highest standard, we need your help.</p>
<p>We truly appreciate your help and in return want to make sure you can be part of this project. Each contribution will get your paws on one of our pawsome perks, from mementos and a visit on set, to having your own film screened ahead of ours at the cinema that started cinema! </p>
<p>Please have a look at the list of perks &amp; rewards on the right to see which take your furry fancy, as any contribution will be most greatly appreciated.  </p>
<p><u><strong>What If We Don't Meet Our Goal? : </strong></u></p>
<p>Our aim is to get enough funding to make this project to the best of our ability and there is a limit to how low we can deliver. Should the campaign fail, the money will not be withdrawn and will be returned to you. In this case, we also won't be able to deliver on the perks, but will instead return your original contribution to you.</p>

<p>There is a saying ""Never work with children or animals"". The truth is, nothing good ever came easy. Yes, filming with animals, especially cats, can be tricky, but we believe that with the combined expertise of our professional Cat Handlers and our own successful experiences with filming and working with cats, we can achieve our goal. </p>
<p>From day one the script was written with a cat in mind and there were frequent consultations, in order to decide if it would be physically plausible for a cat to achieve what was written in the script.   </p>
<p>Animal and Cast and Crew Safety is our top priority so having a cast and crew that have worked with, looked after and are currently owned by cats, will ensure a safe working environment for all involved.   </p>
<p> </p>

<p>We believe that everyone should do their part to help keep our environment clean. For the production of our film we are going to have a "" Say No To Plastic"" policy on set on all of our production days.  This means that there will be little to no single use plastic on set, such as plastic cups, plastic takeaway cups, or plastic straws.   </p>
<p>We realise that a 100% no plastic on set is, at this time, not feasible, however in addition to the above there will be recycling bins on set for all of our production days and all cast scripts will be printed on recycled paper.  </p>
<p>By supporting our film not only will you be helping us to achieve our goal, you'll be helping us pave the way towards a greener way of film making. </p>
<p>All the perks we send out, will be shipped in plastic free and/or biodegradable packaging. </p>

Being around cats for most of my life I got to pick up on the details in cats that really make them...well, cat like. They are such incredibly intelligent animals, each one of them with its own strong personality.
The main thing with cats is that so many people can all relate to certain behavioural traits, even if they don't have cats. So even if you aren't currently owned by a cat, this film is still something that you can relate to and enjoy.

Why £16,000?  
We believe that if we are going to do something, we should do it right and not take the easiest, cheapest route as it is unfair to the cast and crew and unfair to you, our investors and supporters. We want to bring you, and our audience, the best film we possibly can. 
Not only will we need to cover Locations , Cast, Set Design, Transportation, Insurance, Editing, Perk Fulfilment, (and enough prawns to keep our main star happy), we believe that people should be rewarded for their hard work and passion, and we are not fans of offering      so-called ""exposure"" in exchange for peoples hard work. 
To ensure you get a beautiful and fun film that is made to the highest standard, we need your help.
We truly appreciate your help and in return want to make sure you can be part of this project. Each contribution will get your paws on one of our pawsome perks, from mementos and a visit on set, to having your own film screened ahead of ours at the cinema that started cinema! 
Please have a look at the list of perks & rewards on the right to see which take your furry fancy, as any contribution will be most greatly appreciated.  
What If We Don't Meet Our Goal? : 
Our aim is to get enough funding to make this project to the best of our ability and there is a limit to how low we can deliver. Should the campaign fail, the money will not be withdrawn and will be returned to you. In this case, we also won't be able to deliver on the perks, but will instead return your original contribution to you.
 

There is a saying ""Never work with children or animals"". The truth is, nothing good ever came easy. Yes, filming with animals, especially cats, can be tricky, but we believe that with the combined expertise of our professional Cat Handlers and our own successful experiences with filming and working with cats, we can achieve our goal. 
From day one the script was written with a cat in mind and there were frequent consultations, in order to decide if it would be physically plausible for a cat to achieve what was written in the script.   
Animal and Cast and Crew Safety is our top priority so having a cast and crew that have worked with, looked after and are currently owned by cats, will ensure a safe working environment for all involved.   
 

We believe that everyone should do their part to help keep our environment clean. For the production of our film we are going to have a "" Say No To Plastic"" policy on set on all of our production days.  This means that there will be little to no single use plastic on set, such as plastic cups, plastic takeaway cups, or plastic straws.   
We realise that a 100% no plastic on set is, at this time, not feasible, however in addition to the above there will be recycling bins on set for all of our production days and all cast scripts will be printed on recycled paper.  
By supporting our film not only will you be helping us to achieve our goal, you'll be helping us pave the way towards a greener way of film making. 
All the perks we send out, will be shipped in plastic free and/or biodegradable packaging. 
If you have any other suggestions or questions, we would love to hear from you at hello.kittenmefilm@gmail.com

 

   
 
We appreciate your continued support, and are truly humbled by the response we have received when telling people about our film. If you would like to help us but cannot contribute on indiegogo, please don’t despair! We’re also collecting certain old junk to use as props on set, and to create Megan’s wacky inventions! If you live in Greater London and have an unwanted wheel barrow, or rickety old chair you’d like to get rid of, please email us at hello.kittenmefilm@gmail.com and we’ll see about coming to take it off your hands!  
*We cannot guarantee that we will be able to collect from everyone who contacts us. Any items that are deemed to pose a safety hazard cannot be collected.

Last but not least, please do follow us on social media @kittenmefilm and get your friends talking about “You’ve Got To Be Kitten Me!”  
There are easy 'Like' and 'Share' buttons at the top of the campaign page and for a little something extra please visit and share our official website at https://www.kittenmefilm.com and feel free to get in touch, even if its just to say Meow! We'd love to hear from you. 
From all of us on the ""You've Got To Be Kitten Me!"" team ...THANK YOU and we hope you have A PAWSOME DAY!

<h2>MY FATHER BELIZE</h2>
<p>A US born Belizean man travels to Belize to scatter the ashes of his deceased father, only to discover that he himself conceived a son during a past visit to the country. He must now face his own conflicted feelings about fatherhood caused by the estranged relationship he had with the man who gave him life.</p>

<h3>THE STORY</h3>
<p>Sean Sierra (mid 30’s) travels from the United States to the beautiful tourist beach town of Placencia, Belize Central America, to scatter the ashes of his deceased father in his homeland.  Hosted by his uncle Nacio and cousin Nigel, Sean is taken to a village to visit with relatives. Walking through the spaces of his father’s past life proves difficult; it is painful for Sean to reconnect with a man who cheated on his mother and became estranged from the family. Sean feels he would have been better off if Uncle Nacio was his father, a man full of love and life, and whose relationship with Nigel is something Sean desires for himself. By coincidence Sean crosses paths with Aura, a young woman from Belize City who Sean had an affair with during a visit to Belize three years ago. To his surprise, Sean learns that Aura has a two-year-old son who was likely fathered by him. Now Sean must decide if he wants to be in his son’s life, a decision that could put at risk Sean’s engagement to his fiancé in the US. Also a decision that requires that he learn to be a better father than the one he had, a decision that hinders on Sean’s ability to find closure regarding his own feelings of abandonment. Whatever path he chooses will become more complicated as Sean discovers whom his father really was and why he made choices that left a family broken.</p>

<h3>WHY WE ARE INSPIRED TO BRING THIS FILM TO LIFE</h3>
<p>We, Director Leon Lozano and Writer Ron Sierra, are family--cousins--both of us born in the United States to parents who are immigrants from Belize Central America. For both of us, Belize holds a special place in our hearts. Throughout our lives we have both traveled to Belize, learning more about who we are, building and maintaining connections with family and our culture. Our passion for our heritage, the beauty of our homeland, and the stories of its amazing people are what we hope to share with you through this film and in future films to come.</p>
<p>Also, we both are parents of young children, Ron with two boys and Leon with a girl and boy. Our own experiences with fatherhood as sons and fathers are part of where we draw from when breathing life into this story. Fatherhood is complex, rewarding, daunting, wonderful, heartbreaking, and so much more. By exploring it, we hope our viewers will feel as we did when developing this story: validated, inspired, and hopeful. </p>

<h3>YOUR DONATION AT WORK</h3>
<p>Most of us are familiar with commercial films, which have multi-million dollar budgets. However, independent film is different; budgets are much smaller to say the least. At a budget of $15,800, even for a short film, it means our dollars have to stretch far. The cast and crew will be creating this film out of passion for the project.  The money we raise through the My Father Belize - Post Production Indiegogo campaign will go towards post-production expenses. After the film is shot, the picture editing, sound design, and music score composing will bring the film to completion. Then begins the life of the film.  If we are able to exceed our $3000 fund raising goal, the additional money will help close the gap on production expenses, and help us pay for the application fees to submit the film to the top film festivals around the world. It is on the festival circuit where a short film has the opportunity to be recognized, receive awards, and generate important buzz that will successfully position the film and its important message.</p>

<h3><u>Who am I?</u></h3>
<ul><li>I'm one of the founders of the charity Herts Welcomes Syrian Families. I'm also a local music teacher, mother and graduate student and freelancer in sound and music for film.</li></ul>
<h3><u>What is our film about?</u></h3>
<ul>
<li>A man and his family had to run.</li>
<li>He needed health care that couldn't be provided where he was.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, a few ordinary people come together to persuade and give confidence to local councils who feared the financial, logistical and political obstacles to taking part in the UK government's relocation scheme for vulnerable people. </li>
<li>And despite all my doubts, it actually worked!  A year later I was exchanging pictures of our children with another mother from Syria.</li>
<li>That man and his family are here in Herts now too.</li>
<li>Everyone who takes part, contributes and help make this happen will be helping us show the world through other eyes in the most powerful way: true story.</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>I am trying to raise up to £1000 to pay a student or emerging freelance animator. We will take the audio recording of our refugee speaking and work with him and the animator to make sure the pictures show how it felt, and looked, to be there.  The money will pay for the artist and also for an interpreter to help us make sure we get it right.</li>
<li>All contributors will:<ul>
<li>be listed in the credits</li>
<li>be invited to private drinks before HWSF's first screening</li>
<li>as a perk for donations of £20 or more, receive bonus video content of me building the sound effects and music.  I promise to start the camera rolling before I know what I'm planning on doing so you can see me work through the creative process - and you will probably get the chance to laugh at some of the experiments that don't work!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we do not manage to raise the full £1000, we will still continue with this plan, but will try to approach students who would be willing to work with us for a more nominal fee and credit.</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<ul>
<li>Our refugee really wants his story to be known.  We would be helping someone be heard.  The situation in Syria might be complex, but ordinary people on the ground can perhaps offer us the best glimpse of the reality amidst the noise of global political maneuvering. </li>
<li>HWSF campaigned successfully for, and has now welcomed, approximately 200 people brought here on the Vulnerable Persons Relocation scheme (more information <strong><a href=""http://www.hwsf.org.uk/svpr-scheme.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></strong>!).  We have provided welcome meals, befriended these people, coordinated English language help, provided items like bicycles for transport and clothes and more.</li>
<li>This film could be used to help HWSF with publicity so we can keep welcoming more vulnerable people until the war is over.</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>Where to find out more about us all</u></h3>
<ul>
<li>See<strong> <a href=""http://www.hwsf.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hwsf.org.uk</a> </strong>to learn more about Herts Welcomes Syrian Families, or find us on Facebook and Twitter (@HertsWSF).</li>
<li>See <strong><a href=""https://katharineseaton.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/points-of-audition-2-hikaru/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> </strong>to explore my research into the powerful connection between sound and the subconscious and its ability to show subjective experience.</li>
<li>I have previously written music about the refugee experience... <ul>
<li>
<strong><a href=""https://youtu.be/fTCNOMcReLo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Journeys</a></strong> is one of a set of three choral works for a local community choir and explores the dissipation of cultural identity using a poem of Mahmoud Darwish and quoting a traditional melody from St Kilda.</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/katie-seaton-565873597/the-route-031018/s-8U1KQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>The Route</strong></a> is a song inspired by the graphic novel <i>Alpha</i> by Bessora.​</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://youtu.be/XJifSudae4U"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Refugee Blues</strong></a> is a setting of the Auden poem for four female voices and percussion, a rough performance here is married with some images of the current refugee crisis.</li>

<li>And please find more of my work in sound and music<strong> <a href=""https://katharineseaton.com/work/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<ul>
<li>Coordinating creatives and interpreters will be challenging, but HWSF already has a network of Arabic speakers and volunteers who can help with logistics.</li>
<li>Making the filmed sections of this project look really professional is important, but as I am still finishing my master's degree I have access at the University of Hertfordshire to studios, equipment and advice and expertise at no expense.</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Who am I?
I'm one of the founders of the charity Herts Welcomes Syrian Families. I'm also a local music teacher, mother and graduate student and freelancer in sound and music for film.
What is our film about?

A man and his family had to run.
He needed health care that couldn't be provided where he was.
Meanwhile, a few ordinary people come together to persuade and give confidence to local councils who feared the financial, logistical and political obstacles to taking part in the UK government's relocation scheme for vulnerable people. 
And despite all my doubts, it actually worked!  A year later I was exchanging pictures of our children with another mother from Syria.
That man and his family are here in Herts now too.
Everyone who takes part, contributes and help make this happen will be helping us show the world through other eyes in the most powerful way: true story.

What We Need & What You Get

I am trying to raise up to £1000 to pay a student or emerging freelance animator. We will take the audio recording of our refugee speaking and work with him and the animator to make sure the pictures show how it felt, and looked, to be there.  The money will pay for the artist and also for an interpreter to help us make sure we get it right.
All contributors will:
be listed in the credits
be invited to private drinks before HWSF's first screening
as a perk for donations of £20 or more, receive bonus video content of me building the sound effects and music.  I promise to start the camera rolling before I know what I'm planning on doing so you can see me work through the creative process - and you will probably get the chance to laugh at some of the experiments that don't work!


If we do not manage to raise the full £1000, we will still continue with this plan, but will try to approach students who would be willing to work with us for a more nominal fee and credit.

The Impact

Our refugee really wants his story to be known.  We would be helping someone be heard.  The situation in Syria might be complex, but ordinary people on the ground can perhaps offer us the best glimpse of the reality amidst the noise of global political maneuvering. 
HWSF campaigned successfully for, and has now welcomed, approximately 200 people brought here on the Vulnerable Persons Relocation scheme (more information here!).  We have provided welcome meals, befriended these people, coordinated English language help, provided items like bicycles for transport and clothes and more.
This film could be used to help HWSF with publicity so we can keep welcoming more vulnerable people until the war is over.

Where to find out more about us all

See hwsf.org.uk to learn more about Herts Welcomes Syrian Families, or find us on Facebook and Twitter (@HertsWSF).
See here to explore my research into the powerful connection between sound and the subconscious and its ability to show subjective experience.
I have previously written music about the refugee experience... 

Journeys is one of a set of three choral works for a local community choir and explores the dissipation of cultural identity using a poem of Mahmoud Darwish and quoting a traditional melody from St Kilda.

The Route is a song inspired by the graphic novel Alpha by Bessora.​

Refugee Blues is a setting of the Auden poem for four female voices and percussion, a rough performance here is married with some images of the current refugee crisis.


And please find more of my work in sound and music here.



Risks & Challenges

Coordinating creatives and interpreters will be challenging, but HWSF already has a network of Arabic speakers and volunteers who can help with logistics.
Making the filmed sections of this project look really professional is important, but as I am still finishing my master's degree I have access at the University of Hertfordshire to studios, equipment and advice and expertise at no expense.

<h3>WHY IS THIS CAMPAIGN IMPORTANT TO US!</h3>
<p>This campaign is truly important to us because we really believe in this comedy and want to make it a reality. All that are involved loved the idea and the comedic value this film brought through its cast of chaotic characters all rooted to one common theme, celebrating New Years Eve. We all truly believe that each of these characters will make you belly laugh to your core as each new character that's introduced presents new problems for the hosts that we know every party host can relate to. </p>
<p>Ultimately if you help contribute to this feel good film you will be helping pay for devoted actors and crew that give their time and heart to make something they all truly believe in, who should be rewarded for all that they are and will be doing for us this November. You'll also help us pay for our location, costume, props, food, expenses and equipment hire. All of which would help us achieve greatness on this film, and make way for all of us to do what we love, and that's producing quality entertainment for all to enjoy</p>
<h3>The Story Behind The Film</h3>
<p>It all started as a dumb idea during a social realism exercise, wherein our two protagonists would be throwing a party, while actively ignoring everyone's problems. Instead being more concerned with keeping up appearances.<br/>Coming from a fairly middle class family, ‘social realism’ for me meant pretending there were no problems so as not to cause a fuss..<br/>The juxtaposition of the reality I knew and the ‘reality’ within kitchen sink dramas, I felt would play quite well. With the couple stressing about how the party is going, rather than the more dramatic issues of the guests, all set to the ticking clock of the food in the oven.<br/>We gave it the title of that stupid Garlic Bread thing.. Years later it's still just that Goddamn Garlic Bread Film.<br/>I'm truly looking forward to finally seeing it made!<br/>James Bergelin - Writer</p>

<p><strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>LiME follows the journey of a young black dancer learning to embrace his identity and creativity without apology while dissecting internal and external troubles brought about by the rejection of the world he longs to belong to.  </span>The film also encompasses the beauty of coming from the urban jungles and proudly wanting to be a part of where you come from, the beauty in our talents, the beats of our drums,  our dreams and ambitions. </strong></p>
<p><i><u>The film has a lot of light, and love as well. We have entangled the urban and prominent street drill team and drumline culture throughout, which will surely set a vibe!</u></i></p>
<p><strong>The producers of LiME really want to tell that story. With our passion, our hard work and your help... <u><i>WE CAN DO IT!</i></u></strong></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">WHY LiME?</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>LiMe is a film that’s desperately needed that can add to the dialogue about self-care, self-love, and self-acceptance. Growing up brown in the outskirts of Los Angeles provided its own set of challenges, and being “different” can make it even harder for one to feel like they belong.  Making this film won’t only add to to the anti-hate conversation and work being done, but the very hard conversations we need to have about the hate WE give in our communities.  As an artist, I want to tell a story that would open the eyes of many, inspire the youth and hopefully change the way we treat one another.  Sometimes art is the best way in, and through this film, we hope to reach the ones who need to be reached the most. This film includes melanin, majorette dancing, drum squads and its all for Tha Culture!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Even though LiMe is a short film, it’s still a truly ambitious endeavor. The majority of funds will go to obtaining a seasoned and visionary crew, set rentals, transportation, paying actors, band, drill team, filming permits (and in Los Angeles they aren't cheap ), locations, post-production( editing &amp; sound ), of course providing food( breakfast, lunch, and coffee) for the  hardworking cast, extras, and crew during our shoot in Los Angeles, CA &amp; festival submissions.

</div></div>","LiME follows the journey of a young black dancer learning to embrace his identity and creativity without apology while dissecting internal and external troubles brought about by the rejection of the world he longs to belong to.  The film also encompasses the beauty of coming from the urban jungles and proudly wanting to be a part of where you come from, the beauty in our talents, the beats of our drums,  our dreams and ambitions. 
The film has a lot of light, and love as well. We have entangled the urban and prominent street drill team and drumline culture throughout, which will surely set a vibe!
The producers of LiME really want to tell that story. With our passion, our hard work and your help... WE CAN DO IT!
WHY LiME?
LiMe is a film that’s desperately needed that can add to the dialogue about self-care, self-love, and self-acceptance. Growing up brown in the outskirts of Los Angeles provided its own set of challenges, and being “different” can make it even harder for one to feel like they belong.  Making this film won’t only add to to the anti-hate conversation and work being done, but the very hard conversations we need to have about the hate WE give in our communities.  As an artist, I want to tell a story that would open the eyes of many, inspire the youth and hopefully change the way we treat one another.  Sometimes art is the best way in, and through this film, we hope to reach the ones who need to be reached the most. This film includes melanin, majorette dancing, drum squads and its all for Tha Culture!


Even though LiMe is a short film, it’s still a truly ambitious endeavor. The majority of funds will go to obtaining a seasoned and visionary crew, set rentals, transportation, paying actors, band, drill team, filming permits (and in Los Angeles they aren't cheap ), locations, post-production( editing & sound ), of course providing food( breakfast, lunch, and coffee) for the  hardworking cast, extras, and crew during our shoot in Los Angeles, CA & festival submissions. To reiterate ...the majority of your contributions we receive will go directly to our collaborators! 



By donating to our campaign, you are contributing to the much-needed continuous conversation about living in your truth, accepting who you are and finding the courage to do so unapologetically.  No matter who you were or who you’ve become, we all can relate to the story about overcoming adversity, pain, and rejection. You will be helping people who feel like outsiders belong, you will be contributing to love and tolerance this film will incite. 

We would love it if you joined us in helping raise the funds necessary to make this short film a reality. In exchange for your help, we’re going to be giving away some pretty AMAZING perks! VIP access to our set on filming days 1 and 2 in Los Angeles, On-screen credits, Official LiMe Merchandise, and an advanced screening of the film, that's before EVERYONE else sees it! See all the prizes to the right and join the LiME Family! Lastly, the best PERK of them all.. supporting meand my team do someting really special!

<h3>The Story:</h3>
<p>Hello, I’m Alvaro Parra, the director of SONIDERO METROPOLIS, a documentary series that will explore cumbia communities across the United States. </p>
<p>I fell in love with cumbia during my years as a mobile deejay, playing at backyard parties in Southern California. At these multi-generational gatherings, with folks from different corners of Latin America, I learned there was one style of music that would always ignite the dance floor: CUMBIA.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/3YJPlorzBjiBLL1msJ/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The story of cumbia begins on the shores of Colombia, a union of Indigenous, African, and European musical DNA. In the latter half of the 20th century, a Mexico City style known as <i>cumbia sonidera </i>became popular in the working class neighborhoods of the ancient Aztec capital. This slower, bass heavy style was recorded by bands and played by SONIDEROS, the mobile sound systems that would blast this music at open air events, large or small. Microphone skills were a must. Over time, <i>Saludos</i> or shout outs became a vital component of the sonideros craft.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/uTYp8rJ1J9X09Du4pu/source.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At first glance, sonidero culture is a spectacle of towering speakers, neon lights and smoke machines, orchestrated by a deejay that interrupts the music with deft precision to shout out a never ending litany of names and places. On closer examination, there is a working class politics at play, occupying urban space through sound and dance, and as a result the construction of a social identity. The ardent fans who follow their sonideros around the city form part of a social fabric that includes dancers, clubs, promoters, and the ever present live streamer. Family members listening in the United States or Mexico via a live stream are given the ultimate gift: a saludo sent across thousand of miles, acknowledging their existence in a world of migrant labor where they are often rendered invisible.</p>

<p><b>Episode 1: Sonido Fantasma and the Los Angeles Scene</b></p>
<p>The first episode of Sonidero Metropolis will look to explore the intersection between migration, cumbia music, labor, legal status, and the city of Los Angeles. </p>
<p>Sonido Fantasma, aka Antonio De Jesus, originally from Atlixco, Puebla, itself a hot bed of sonidero culture, emigrated to Los Angeles in 1989. After working for years in the garment industry he saved enough money to buy his first system. In 1994 he blew out his speakers at his first solo show. He bounced back of course and for the past 27 years Sonido Fantasma has built up a massive audio and visual rig. He is of the rare U.S. based sonideros that often travel outside his home state for gigs. For more than 2 decades, Salon Lazaro's has been his L.A. home. Tony Fantasma has accomplished what many U.S. and Mexico based sonideros dream of: playing on both sides of the border and living solely from his craft. In the early 2000's he got the chance to play the most important sonidero stage in the world, Mexico City's Zocalo, and he's got the video to prove it. Through his story we will examine the history of the sonidero tradition in Los Angeles. </p>

<p>Episode 2: Turbo Sonidero and the Bay Area Scene</p>
<p>For many first or second generation Latinxs born in the U.S., cumbia music, like other genres from Latin America, can play a vital role towards connecting with their heritage.</p>
<p>Roman Zepeda, better known as Turbo Sonidero, is the embodiment of this idea. A Chicano producer from the east side of San Jose, since 2007 he has been producing a dark and gritty sound with roots in Mexico (CUMBIA) and the United States (HIP HOP). A dedicated vinyl collector of cumbia, Zepeda possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of bands, labels, and sonideros from all of the major epicenters of Mexican cumbia. He once moved to Puebla in order to immerse himself in the culture and glean further knowledge. As Turbo Sonidero, he has played countless cities across the U.S., Mexico, and last year he completed a tour of Colombia. In San Jose, he is a founding member of the Sonido Clash Collective, a crew that produces a variety of parties and cultural happening in the city, culminating each year with their capstone Sonido Clash Music Festival (last year's headliner was Alberto Pedraza, the godfather of MX City cumbia sonidera.) These days you can find him playing throughout the bay (and L.A.) and at the Oakland monthly party Cumbia Town. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Research and development for this project began 9 months ago and we have been shooting in Los Angeles and San Jose for the past 5 months. Now we need your help to complete the first two episodes. Funding will allow for the hiring of a crew to complete our final shooting assignments in both cities. Additionally, the funds we raise will also apply towards post-production editing, sound mixing and color grading. </p>
<p>As a thank you, our perks will take you into the heart of cumbia sonidera: the music. A few highlights include a personalized track by Turbo Sonidero and a live mix by Sonido Fantasma, as well as your name converted into a sonidero style animated logo. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In this current moment of national divisiveness and extreme stereotyping of immigrants, this documentary's biggest goal is to give a voice and a face to those that we pass on the street. The people that come to this country looking for a better life, chasing the American dream that so many have already succeeded at before them. By documenting sonideros, producers and followers of this predominantly migrant scene in Los Angeles and the Bay Area, I hope to shed some understanding on the immigrant experience. In particular, the way in which music gives meaning to peoples lives--how one can utilize a dance floor, or play a certain track to remember their homeland. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>At this time, less than 1% of Netflix's original series center the U.S. Latino experience. The time is now to support an episodic series that celebrates the cumbia communities of the United States. Our dream is to make episodes on the movers and shakers of the cumbia scenes in New York, Atlanta, Chicago, San Antonio, Portland, Seattle, and all of the places in between. Documenting both traditional migrant centered sonidero culture as well as the stories of people like Turbo Sonidero, the son of immigrants, remixing cumbia, and playing at the best Latin Bass parties across the land. There is a massive, vibrant cultural movement out there. This is positive cultural production, live and direct, and we intend to show it to the world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Any little bit helps and I am eternally grateful to anything that is contributed. But I understand if you just can't and would appreciate a share and help in getting the word out on this amazing project! THANK YOU! </p>

<p><strong>About the Story </strong></p>
<p>I lost my uncle and my grandmother in 2018, two months apart due to different illnesses. A month before the first loss, there was an fatal private jet accident back in my home country where 11 amazing young woman died. During this same time, living in the US, I witnessed the horrors of the Florida School Shooting followed by the death of Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade due to suicide. Yet, these were only a few of the incidents we heard because they were on the media.</p>
<p>The high school shootings and suicides in the past year have had a significant impact on many communities, pushing teenagers and young adults to create and participate in captivating movements aimed to spread awareness on gun control and suicide prevention. While these events were devastating and heartbreaking, these individuals and groups who stood up for what they believed in for the greater good was and remains inspirational.  </p>
<p>As the Walls Hum focuses on the intense elements of the mourning process that bring on emotional breakdowns, depression, eating disorders, and extended trauma.</p>
<p>Tackling such sensitive, deep and personal incidents, the story aims to serve as both an awareness raising and an comforting piece of visual work for others that was created from my own experience in my mourning process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How Do Graffiti Tie in With the Story? </strong></p>
<p>Moving to San Jose, California earlier this year, I was pleasantly shocked to see that this city was full of street art. Everyday as I walked pass by these amazing art pieces, I started recognizing the stories they all represented. Each had deeper meanings full of symbolism mostly generating an universal or a significant cause. Then it hit me, graffiti is an wide spread, freely viewed, universally understood pieces of art that almost always carries a hidden message about a cause or an effect.</p>
<p>Through this story, I wanted to challenge the current old school perception of viewing graffiti or any type of street art as an act of vandalism. For me, most are mesmerizing pieces of art that needs more appreciation along with the bold artists that creates them.</p>

I lost my uncle and my grandmother in 2018, two months apart due to different illnesses. A month before the first loss, there was an fatal private jet accident back in my home country where 11 amazing young woman died. During this same time, living in the US, I witnessed the horrors of the Florida School Shooting followed by the death of Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade due to suicide. Yet, these were only a few of the incidents we heard because they were on the media.
The high school shootings and suicides in the past year have had a significant impact on many communities, pushing teenagers and young adults to create and participate in captivating movements aimed to spread awareness on gun control and suicide prevention. While these events were devastating and heartbreaking, these individuals and groups who stood up for what they believed in for the greater good was and remains inspirational.  
As the Walls Hum focuses on the intense elements of the mourning process that bring on emotional breakdowns, depression, eating disorders, and extended trauma.
Tackling such sensitive, deep and personal incidents, the story aims to serve as both an awareness raising and an comforting piece of visual work for others that was created from my own experience in my mourning process.
 
How Do Graffiti Tie in With the Story? 
Moving to San Jose, California earlier this year, I was pleasantly shocked to see that this city was full of street art. Everyday as I walked pass by these amazing art pieces, I started recognizing the stories they all represented. Each had deeper meanings full of symbolism mostly generating an universal or a significant cause. Then it hit me, graffiti is an wide spread, freely viewed, universally understood pieces of art that almost always carries a hidden message about a cause or an effect.
Through this story, I wanted to challenge the current old school perception of viewing graffiti or any type of street art as an act of vandalism. For me, most are mesmerizing pieces of art that needs more appreciation along with the bold artists that creates them.

<h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Leslie Askew and I am a documentary filmmaker. I'm from the U.S., and for the majority of my career I've worked in documentary television for major networks as a Producer/Director.  In the past 10 years, I lived in The Netherlands and Australia creating a variety of content from travel shows to television commercials. </p>
<p>At the same time, I've independently made films for myself and non profits and I would like to focus more of my time on creating content about social issues and people that matter to me.</p>
<p>I'm a 41 year-old,married with 2 step daughters and a Australian Bulldog named Bernie Sanders. </p> <h2>WHY I NEED YOUR SUPPORT?</h2>
<p>My film Analog Man has recently been selected as a finalist in the ARFF Film Festival in Berlin and I super proud because this is the<u> first </u>film I've made that has made it into a film festival. This is an important milestone in my career and I couldn't be happier to finally be able to share it with an audience.</p>
<p><strong>BUT,</strong> I will only be able to do so if I can raise the money to pay for music clearance and to finalise the film. Early on I made the artistic decision to use incredible artists like Louis Armstrong, Cecil Taylor and Duke Ellington as the soundtrack for the film because this film is all about Sander's love of music.  </p>
<p><strong>NOW, </strong>I need to pay for it. The screening is on June 8th, <strong>ALMOST 2 WEEKS</strong> away and I need to hire a music supervisor to obtain permission from record labels and then pay the record labels for the music licensing for festival use only.</p>
<p>Also, the film needs the final bells and whistles with a colour grade and final sound mix so it is ready to be played in the cinema.</p>
<p>Up until now, I have fully funded this project out of pocket, but I am at the point where I need your help to finally make this film a reality.</p>
<p><strong>GOAL:</strong> To obtain festival level clearance for the film and then, fingers crossed, it will be picked up by a distributor and shown on a screen near you.</p> <h2>WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?</h2>
<p>There are 3 tiers to the fundraising. </p>
<p><strong>First </strong>priority is to get music clearance for the film festival in<strong> 2 weeks!!</strong> These are exact costs, no fluff added, on what it will cost to get the film on screens.</p>
<ul>
<li>Music Supervision: $3500 </li>
<li>Music Licensing: $5000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second</strong> step, get money for finalising film, so it looks and sounds its best! AND submit to more film festivals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finishing Film ( Colorgrading, Sound Mix ): $3000 </li>
<li>Festival Fees: $500 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third </strong>and final tier to the fundraising is if I reach my goal I would like to recoup production expenses already incurred. I estimate that I've already spent $15,000 on the film already, I would like to make some of that back, so I can reinvest in my next project.</p>
<ul><li>Production Expenses: $8000 </li></ul> <h2>IMPACT</h2>
<p>I've been a successful television producer / director for nearly 20 years keeping projects on time and on budget.  This my first foray into crowd funding and I am going to approach this in the same way I would budgets for television shows or commercials. Source the best talent for the best price, make sure legally all of the boxes have been ticked and make sure the film looks its best. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHY MUSIC MATTERS</h2>
<p>The music in this film is integral to telling the story of Sanders Chase.  Each song continues whatever discussion was being had by the characters and ties the story together.    The artist I chose are hugely significant to my life in some way or I discovered through the process of making the film. </p>
<p>Growing up,  I listened to Louis Armstrong and his album with Ella Fitzgerald was my absolute favourite. When I graduated from university, I was fortunate to get an internship, through my best friend Ioana Friedman at Magnum Photos. Magnum is a photo agency that represents some of the most famous photographers in the world. One of which, I became friends with who I adored and was a sort of mentor for me, Dennis Stock. He was best known for photographing James Dean in Times Square or Audrey Hepurbn on the set of Breakfast at Tiffanys.  Dennis would tell me hilarious  stories about his good friend Louis. He photographed Louis Armstrong extensively and a captured him in beautifully private and personal moments that have stayed with me to this day. Dennis was one of the first people who encouraged me to become a filmmaker and believed in me when I didn't. In Analog Man, I open and close the film in tribute to him and Louis Armstrong. Two artists that I respect and admire and whose example continue to inspire me. </p>
<p>One of my most proudest achievements is graduating from Duke Ellington School of the Arts, in Washington D.C. It is an incredible institution where I learned about African American culture, history, music and artistic tradition. Every morning our school 'bell', that singled its was time to go to our first class was Duke Ellington's song, 'The A Train.'  This education shaped me and I could never do enough to pay homage to him as an artist or the school.  So, there was no question I had to include him in this film.</p>
<p>The song, 'I Wonder' by Cecil Taylor, I discovered when I was editing the film. I'd never heard of him and immediately fell in love with his sound and melancholy. It was important to include this song because I wanted more people to experience him and also it fit perfectly with Henry, the Archivists, demeanour. It is my favourite scene in the film and I often just skip to the section just to watch it. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Thank you so much for supporting my project, I can't say thank you enough.</p>
</div><p><br/><br/><br/> </p></div>","WHO AM I?
Hi, my name is Leslie Askew and I am a documentary filmmaker. I'm from the U.S., and for the majority of my career I've worked in documentary television for major networks as a Producer/Director.  In the past 10 years, I lived in The Netherlands and Australia creating a variety of content from travel shows to television commercials. 
At the same time, I've independently made films for myself and non profits and I would like to focus more of my time on creating content about social issues and people that matter to me.
I'm a 41 year-old,married with 2 step daughters and a Australian Bulldog named Bernie Sanders.  WHY I NEED YOUR SUPPORT?
My film Analog Man has recently been selected as a finalist in the ARFF Film Festival in Berlin and I super proud because this is the first film I've made that has made it into a film festival. This is an important milestone in my career and I couldn't be happier to finally be able to share it with an audience.
BUT, I will only be able to do so if I can raise the money to pay for music clearance and to finalise the film. Early on I made the artistic decision to use incredible artists like Louis Armstrong, Cecil Taylor and Duke Ellington as the soundtrack for the film because this film is all about Sander's love of music.  
NOW, I need to pay for it. The screening is on June 8th, ALMOST 2 WEEKS away and I need to hire a music supervisor to obtain permission from record labels and then pay the record labels for the music licensing for festival use only.
Also, the film needs the final bells and whistles with a colour grade and final sound mix so it is ready to be played in the cinema.
Up until now, I have fully funded this project out of pocket, but I am at the point where I need your help to finally make this film a reality.
GOAL: To obtain festival level clearance for the film and then, fingers crossed, it will be picked up by a distributor and shown on a screen near you. WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?
There are 3 tiers to the fundraising. 
First priority is to get music clearance for the film festival in 2 weeks!! These are exact costs, no fluff added, on what it will cost to get the film on screens.

Music Supervision: $3500 
Music Licensing: $5000

Second step, get money for finalising film, so it looks and sounds its best! AND submit to more film festivals.

Finishing Film ( Colorgrading, Sound Mix ): $3000 
Festival Fees: $500 

Third and final tier to the fundraising is if I reach my goal I would like to recoup production expenses already incurred. I estimate that I've already spent $15,000 on the film already, I would like to make some of that back, so I can reinvest in my next project.
Production Expenses: $8000  IMPACT
I've been a successful television producer / director for nearly 20 years keeping projects on time and on budget.  This my first foray into crowd funding and I am going to approach this in the same way I would budgets for television shows or commercials. Source the best talent for the best price, make sure legally all of the boxes have been ticked and make sure the film looks its best. 
 
 
WHY MUSIC MATTERS
The music in this film is integral to telling the story of Sanders Chase.  Each song continues whatever discussion was being had by the characters and ties the story together.    The artist I chose are hugely significant to my life in some way or I discovered through the process of making the film. 
Growing up,  I listened to Louis Armstrong and his album with Ella Fitzgerald was my absolute favourite. When I graduated from university, I was fortunate to get an internship, through my best friend Ioana Friedman at Magnum Photos. Magnum is a photo agency that represents some of the most famous photographers in the world. One of which, I became friends with who I adored and was a sort of mentor for me, Dennis Stock. He was best known for photographing James Dean in Times Square or Audrey Hepurbn on the set of Breakfast at Tiffanys.  Dennis would tell me hilarious  stories about his good friend Louis. He photographed Louis Armstrong extensively and a captured him in beautifully private and personal moments that have stayed with me to this day. Dennis was one of the first people who encouraged me to become a filmmaker and believed in me when I didn't. In Analog Man, I open and close the film in tribute to him and Louis Armstrong. Two artists that I respect and admire and whose example continue to inspire me. 
One of my most proudest achievements is graduating from Duke Ellington School of the Arts, in Washington D.C. It is an incredible institution where I learned about African American culture, history, music and artistic tradition. Every morning our school 'bell', that singled its was time to go to our first class was Duke Ellington's song, 'The A Train.'  This education shaped me and I could never do enough to pay homage to him as an artist or the school.  So, there was no question I had to include him in this film.
The song, 'I Wonder' by Cecil Taylor, I discovered when I was editing the film. I'd never heard of him and immediately fell in love with his sound and melancholy. It was important to include this song because I wanted more people to experience him and also it fit perfectly with Henry, the Archivists, demeanour. It is my favourite scene in the film and I often just skip to the section just to watch it. 
Fundamentally, this film is about not forgetting where we come from and music is a repository where we store our lives. The music matters because we matter.

I am also a psychologist and a facilitator specializing in process work. A big part of my identity is also my healing path which I am describing in a memoir book I am currently working on. This music video for my song “4K Pieces” is very special to me and through it I would like to share with you my personal life story…</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>A healing journey: <strong>from 4K Pieces to a fulfilled person</strong>
</h2>
<p><strong>Agnieszka Olszewska-Kaczmarek</strong>: For most of my adolescent years I was a wounded and depressed woman. Having experienced extreme violence in my childhood I was like a knight hidden under armor, focused on survival and ready to fight with anyone who got too close. But my internal power and great need for fulfillment in life made me seek support. On this long path of pursuing happiness I experienced amazing healing from Mother Earth, spiritual forces, women’s circle, animals spirit medicine, ancestors, friends, lovers and therapists. Two years ago I was magically guided to meet a process work therapist and teacher Dawn Menken who changed my life completely. Thanks to sessions with her I stood firm on my feet, found my own core and became a loving friend for myself. Dawn helped me to find and put together pieces of myself scattered through the Universe.  I have become a complete and fulfilled person. And by the way I started to study a process work method!</p>
<p>In recognition of this healing journey and Dawn’s impact on me I wrote a song ‘4K Pieces’ and started to write a memoir book describing my life path.</p>
<p>Magic continued in my life as a few weeks later I met Małgorzata Ola Dobrowolska, a director of the beautiful documentary about Buddhist nuns <strong><a href=""https://bhikkhuni-film.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Bhikkhuni. Buddhism, Sri Lanka, Revolution”</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Małgorzata Ola Dobrowolska:</strong> When I meet Agnieszka I was deeply moved by her music and personality. One of my life's dreams has become to make a creative project with her.</p>
<p><strong>Agnieszka Olszewska-Kaczmarek: </strong>When Małgorzata listened to ‘4K Pieces’ and wrote the screenplay I was completely shocked when I read her ideas. I had goosebumps! We did not know much about one another but she suggested using props which precisely and literally symbolized special moments from my life path! Imagine. One of the main healing experiences of my life took place in a spiral shape built on the ground during a ceremony for Mother Earth. In the scenario the spiral is exactly the first sign that guides the main character to leave her lonely tower on the water! The more ideas Małgorzata brought to the table, the more thrilled I became.  I love how rich the screenplay is and I can’t wait to see the visual expression of all the scenes. We have done some initial shootings and they are captivating and moving. I feel we are guided by some greater force to cooperate on this production.</p>

<h2>The music video and short film<strong>: from patriarchy to New Consciousness. Story about Women's Spirituality and a New Paradigm of a peaceful world.  </strong>
</h2>
<p>The video’s story is about a severely wounded woman hidden beneath a suit of armor. She is a knight in her lonely tower on the water. One day, while guided by spiritual forces, she leaves her shelter and embarks on a magical journey that will change her life completely.</p>
<p>There will be many scenes on the water and interesting adventures. And everything that happens, every prop used, each outfit and location has a deeper meaning. We are sure the viewers will enjoy encoding the archetypal symbols, find their own meaning in them and experience emotions stimulated by the music and adventures of the main character. We feel a deep need to share this story with other people, to honor women’s power and healing forces, but most of all to support others. We hope those who watch it will see the reflection of their own experiences in this video.</p>

<p><strong>Creation.</strong> Screenplay, direction, cinematography and editing fee. We have already completed part of the shooting for the music video by investing our own money and resources, however, the production scenario became so rich, complex and full of different, difficult to manage locations, such as a tower on the water, a gate, journey on the boat etc., that now we need extra help to finish production. These locations demand much time and specialized equipment. Photo shoots on the water are much more time consuming than on land and demand extra safety precautions.</p>
<p>Except for the music video, we will also make a short movie about Agnieszka’s healing journey, with interview and shoots from the music video production.  </p>
<p><strong>Promotion.</strong> We would love the opportunity to share our work worldwide. We have a very interesting promotional plan. Our main destinations are the US, Australia, countries in Asia and our homeland Poland. We are planning study stays in those countries aimed at establishing new contacts, building support networks, exchanging experiences and of course organizing screenings!

</div></div>","What is spamflix.com?

A Video on Demand platform developed by Markus Duffner with the technology of Swiss based IT company Cryms  and designed by Brazilian Papanapa with transactional business model, where users pay for a single access to a film (between 3,5 and 5 € or 4 and 6 USD) for 72 hours streaming.
A brand with a precise editorial line that focuses mainly on films with a supernatural edge, fierce satire, black comedy and absolute weird nonsense. Spamflix will kick-off with around 40 titles and add 1 or 2 new features every month (scroll to the bottom to check-out our initial line-up).
A playful environment with different interactive activities that will be renewed periodically: quizzes, games and contests with free film coupons rewards.
A chance to propose your film to a wide audience: the Submit your film tab gives you the chance to propose your title to our selection team.
A selection of News highlights.
A selection of the craziest Browser Games (in development, coming in 2019).
Spamflix is now in testing and debugging stage and your help will be fundamental to widen our catalogue and boost our promotional campaign's outreach to make Spamflix a recognizable alternative VOD platform option after its release in September 2018.

About Us

Proud to be geek, Markus Duffner has a master degree in cinema with a thesis about Monty Python's Philosophy. With more than 10 years professional experience in international film industry and film festivals, Markus has been developing the project of Spamflix in the past 2 years given his international network with right holders and Film Sales companies and driven by a need for an alternative indie platform with a thrill for nonsense and playful silliness.
Half German, half Italian, working, among others, for a French magazine and a Swiss Film Festival, living in Portugal and with a Brazilian partner, it was obvious for Markus that this platform should be available Worldwide.



Where does your money go?

We need around 20K for our initial promotional campaign in order to create awareness around Spamflix and have the chance to be heard by our potential audience.
The budget will be mostly allocated for Facebook, Instagram and other social's promotion and to co-host events, master-classes or Q&As, with our film festival partners (Bruxelles International Fantastic Film Festival, MOTEL/X, Trieste Science Fiction Festival, etc.) and with the help of our media partners (Cineuropa.org, LatamCinema.com, etc.). At these events Spamflix's users will be able to live stream the event and ask questions to the invited guests.
Should we overcome our 20K initial goal, all the extra money will be used to enlarge our... catalogue! Help us to get as many weird titles as possible!

<p>The interviews capture not only their enthusiasm and vibrant creative spirits, but also a unique perspective on the impact their art has, and its contribution to the culture of Burning Man.</p>
<p>Flash forward to present day: we're now ready to complete their story arc, and illustrate the profound connectedness that this art brings to Black Rock City and the world...exploring what it truly means to be human.</p>
<p>Future interviews are secured with <a href=""http://www.marcocochranesculpture.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marco Cochrane</a>, <a href=""http://www.jakobbokulich.com/new-work.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jakob Bokulich</a>/<a href=""https://www.hatchfund.org/project/big_pollinator"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Big Pollinator crew</a>, and follow-up interviews with the aforementioned artists. The new interviews will discuss the change and impact their artistic careers have had over the past four years for themselves and the community, challenges and triumphs they faced, how we continue to evolve, and possibilities for the future. We will be gathering archives and documenting the artists’ process, showing their dedication, excitement and conviction. To complete this project we want to document them in their expansive states, immersed in the energetic transformation that occurs as they experience their projects come to life on the playa.</p>
<p>This feature length documentary will explore themes of growth; transformation; feminine empowerment; self expression; collaboration and giving; the creative process; the evolution of the art, the artists and the community; and, again, what it means to be human.</p>
</div><div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Our ambition</h2>
<p>The target audience for this project is...everyone. Radical inclusion is the core of Burning Man, and we want to bring the journey of the artists and the Burning Man community to as many people as possible, with the hope of inspiring others to express their own creativity and inner light.</p>
<p>We believe Burning Man has every possibility to encourage a more loving, peaceful, and open-minded existence for all of humanity. We want to celebrate the joys of how human connectedness brings great freedom and endless possibilities for the future. Art and community fosters this connectedness, which is why we are so passionate to create this film.</p>
<p>Our intention is to enter the film into film festivals and possibly, with enough acclaim, seek distribution on the web through streaming outlets so that everyone might experience the insight, vision and inspiration that these incredible individuals have to share.</p>

<p>Own a piece of the film from our 2014 interview with Erick Dunn, artist of BioTronEsis—a Burning Man HONORARIUM Art Installation. The BioTron itself was a large translucent cocoon inhabited by a super organism of hyper exotic alien light creatures on it’s outer shell. Inside, the cocoon grew thick layers of white fur for humans to sink comfortably into before being entranced. Then, all who enter her drift off with the entrainment frequencies of the blinking lights as they are lulled into a deep trance like hypnotic state.</p>
<p>The BioTron was lost in the 2017 October Sonoma wildfires.</p>
<p>As seen in the 2014 interview, he made beautiful rings sculpted from molds inspired by Mother Nature. Made from a soft rubber, they are comfortable, playful, and interactive to the touch. <strong><i>Incredibly rare</i></strong>, these are the last of his ring collection in the aftermath of him losing everything in the Napa fires. We are so lucky to offer you this amazing perk!</p>

</ul>
<p>Our process begins with design and 3D modeling. Tomas uses a digital sculpting software called Zbrush to craft every part with finesse and care, treating it as though it’s a piece of art to be hung in The Louvre. Once we’re happy with the design on-screen, we use our 3D printer to create a prototype</p>
<p>We then send our design and prototype to an Ethical Manufacturing facility in Bangkok, Thailand that takes care of the casting and finishing. There, our factory casts our jewelry in surgical stainless steel and plates them with silver, rose gold, 18k gold, or oxidized titanium. They use recycled metals in every piece they produce.</p>
<p>Once the casting and finishing process is complete, we place our orders in small batches to ensure every piece is completed with the highest quality and care in mind. In fact, our first batch achieved a rate of 70% recycled materials.</p>
<p>Even though every piece of jewelry is designed in a 3D environment, each one maintains the vintage charm of intricate handcrafted designs to create a piece that’s as unique as you.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Thank you so much for your contribution</strong></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">—The A.R.T. Team</h2>
</div></div>","Four years ago, prior to Burning Man 2014, Jessica had the privilege to interview a handful of remarkable artists set to debut the playa: Torrey Pines Smith, Kahai Sumida Tate, Erick Dunn, Peter Hudson, Katy Boynton, and notable people such as Tomas McCabe(former Executive Director of Black Rock Arts), Steven Raspa(Community Events Producer for Burning Man), and Tex Allen.
The interviews capture not only their enthusiasm and vibrant creative spirits, but also a unique perspective on the impact their art has, and its contribution to the culture of Burning Man.
Flash forward to present day: we're now ready to complete their story arc, and illustrate the profound connectedness that this art brings to Black Rock City and the world...exploring what it truly means to be human.
Future interviews are secured with Marco Cochrane, Jakob Bokulich/Big Pollinator crew, and follow-up interviews with the aforementioned artists. The new interviews will discuss the change and impact their artistic careers have had over the past four years for themselves and the community, challenges and triumphs they faced, how we continue to evolve, and possibilities for the future. We will be gathering archives and documenting the artists’ process, showing their dedication, excitement and conviction. To complete this project we want to document them in their expansive states, immersed in the energetic transformation that occurs as they experience their projects come to life on the playa.
This feature length documentary will explore themes of growth; transformation; feminine empowerment; self expression; collaboration and giving; the creative process; the evolution of the art, the artists and the community; and, again, what it means to be human.

 
Our ambition
The target audience for this project is...everyone. Radical inclusion is the core of Burning Man, and we want to bring the journey of the artists and the Burning Man community to as many people as possible, with the hope of inspiring others to express their own creativity and inner light.
We believe Burning Man has every possibility to encourage a more loving, peaceful, and open-minded existence for all of humanity. We want to celebrate the joys of how human connectedness brings great freedom and endless possibilities for the future. Art and community fosters this connectedness, which is why we are so passionate to create this film.
Our intention is to enter the film into film festivals and possibly, with enough acclaim, seek distribution on the web through streaming outlets so that everyone might experience the insight, vision and inspiration that these incredible individuals have to share.
 
Burning Man Approved Us!
Of hundreds of applications to film at burning man, only a few are selected each year. We are so excited and grateful to be approved and bring this film to you!

Our Unique Perks

Biotronesis Light Art | Interactive light and sound sculptures created by artist Erick Dunn.
Own a piece of the film from our 2014 interview with Erick Dunn, artist of BioTronEsis—a Burning Man HONORARIUM Art Installation. The BioTron itself was a large translucent cocoon inhabited by a super organism of hyper exotic alien light creatures on it’s outer shell. Inside, the cocoon grew thick layers of white fur for humans to sink comfortably into before being entranced. Then, all who enter her drift off with the entrainment frequencies of the blinking lights as they are lulled into a deep trance like hypnotic state.
The BioTron was lost in the 2017 October Sonoma wildfires.
As seen in the 2014 interview, he made beautiful rings sculpted from molds inspired by Mother Nature. Made from a soft rubber, they are comfortable, playful, and interactive to the touch. Incredibly rare, these are the last of his ring collection in the aftermath of him losing everything in the Napa fires. We are so lucky to offer you this amazing perk!

Astor + Orion | Just like many aspects of life, Astor + Orion was born out of a coincidental meeting.
The Stella filigree hoop earrings are intricately crafted and vibrate with good energy.

Made from 70% recycled stainless steel
Hinged post closure
Hand Sculpted with love in Seattle
*Finished with 18k rose gold
*Finished with 18k gold
*Finished with anodized titanium

Our process begins with design and 3D modeling. Tomas uses a digital sculpting software called Zbrush to craft every part with finesse and care, treating it as though it’s a piece of art to be hung in The Louvre. Once we’re happy with the design on-screen, we use our 3D printer to create a prototype
We then send our design and prototype to an Ethical Manufacturing facility in Bangkok, Thailand that takes care of the casting and finishing. There, our factory casts our jewelry in surgical stainless steel and plates them with silver, rose gold, 18k gold, or oxidized titanium. They use recycled metals in every piece they produce.
Once the casting and finishing process is complete, we place our orders in small batches to ensure every piece is completed with the highest quality and care in mind. In fact, our first batch achieved a rate of 70% recycled materials.
Even though every piece of jewelry is designed in a 3D environment, each one maintains the vintage charm of intricate handcrafted designs to create a piece that’s as unique as you.

<p>The story of ‘Harry Metcalfe: Big Gay Mess’ follows the internal arc everybody goes through following a break up; from pining after a lost love and carrying the shattered remains of a broken and grief-ridden ego to the slightly more optimistic stage of being ready to put yourself out there.</p>
<p>We follow as our eponymous hero guides us through his perspective on his experience as a self-described “trendy, young, bisexual man” thrust suddenly and unexpectedly into the world of the single life. We first meet Harry in the moments immediately following his unceremonious, over-the-phone dumping from his boyfriend of two years, after which we see a brief display of the initial weeks of sorrow and loneliness before Harry walks us through the process of preparation for his first foray back into the dating scene.</p>
<p>The story is told to us personally by Harry in several instances of direct address throughout the film. Where Richard III makes the audience complicit in his crimes, Harry invites us to share in his emotional redemption. Ultimately, after allowing his own sense of self-worth to be defined by those around him for the majority of his story, the film climaxes with Harry reconciling with his new status as a single man, and coming to learn that he doesn’t need another person in his life to make him happy. A sentiment he succinctly conveys to us in the form of a musical number somewhere between ‘Life’s a Happy Song’ and ‘Another Day of Sun’<strong> </strong> .</p>

<p><strong>Director's Statement:</strong></p>
<p>""Harry Metcalfe’s BGM gives a voice to LGBT community members living in the outskirts of England.</p>
<p>My team and I aim to create an entertaining film accompanied by a strong social message. The themes we will be depicting are loneliness and the hardship to find a companion through a comedic prism.</p>
<p>In that way, we will be able to transcend a very strong social message about the life of a bisexual man in a very engaging way. Our core idea is to capture in detail the reality and the struggle of an everyday bisexual man, by creating absurd and funny situations.</p>
<p>LGBT films should not only be defined by hardcore drama or flamboyant extremes but also as something casual and regular. We are in 2018 after all.</p>
<p>Regarding the visual style, we will be applying various techniques such as breaking the fourth wall and smooth transition shots while accompanied by smart production design elements. I want the film to be a window that invites the viewer to observe each and all the movie-magic tricks that we will create and give a naturalistic fluidity that appeals to the eye."" </p>

<h3>About the film</h3>
<p>The whole film has been done on a low budget, thankfully we have managed to get good deals on equipment, locations and cast/crew which has made the filming of this project possible. Up until this point we have funded the film ourselves, however, we are running low on our budget due to some unforeseen expenses so we need you to move us forward to post-production and distribution. </p>
<p>Each member of the crew and cast has worked really hard to make the pre-production and the production of this project as effective and high-quality as possible so we would really be disappointed if we weren't able to get the same high-quality effect from our post-production, or if people were not able to see the film because we cannot afford to submit it to festivals. Any money you can give would mean the world to us. When we say every little help, we really do mean it.</p>
<p>Please do take a look through the perks we are offering for contributors! It's our way of saying thank you for helping us out and we appreciate the help so much.</p>
<p>If you don't have any money to spare but like the sound of our project and want to help we would be so thankful if you could tell people about Harry Metcalfe and help us spread the word.</p>
<p>If we could give all you contributors a hug we would! </p>

The story is told to us personally by Harry in several instances of direct address throughout the film. Where Richard III makes the audience complicit in his crimes, Harry invites us to share in his emotional redemption. Ultimately, after allowing his own sense of self-worth to be defined by those around him for the majority of his story, the film climaxes with Harry reconciling with his new status as a single man, and coming to learn that he doesn’t need another person in his life to make him happy. A sentiment he succinctly conveys to us in the form of a musical number somewhere between ‘Life’s a Happy Song’ and ‘Another Day of Sun’  .

Director's Statement:
""Harry Metcalfe’s BGM gives a voice to LGBT community members living in the outskirts of England.
My team and I aim to create an entertaining film accompanied by a strong social message. The themes we will be depicting are loneliness and the hardship to find a companion through a comedic prism.
In that way, we will be able to transcend a very strong social message about the life of a bisexual man in a very engaging way. Our core idea is to capture in detail the reality and the struggle of an everyday bisexual man, by creating absurd and funny situations.
LGBT films should not only be defined by hardcore drama or flamboyant extremes but also as something casual and regular. We are in 2018 after all.
Regarding the visual style, we will be applying various techniques such as breaking the fourth wall and smooth transition shots while accompanied by smart production design elements. I want the film to be a window that invites the viewer to observe each and all the movie-magic tricks that we will create and give a naturalistic fluidity that appeals to the eye.""

About the film
The whole film has been done on a low budget, thankfully we have managed to get good deals on equipment, locations and cast/crew which has made the filming of this project possible. Up until this point we have funded the film ourselves, however, we are running low on our budget due to some unforeseen expenses so we need you to move us forward to post-production and distribution. 
Each member of the crew and cast has worked really hard to make the pre-production and the production of this project as effective and high-quality as possible so we would really be disappointed if we weren't able to get the same high-quality effect from our post-production, or if people were not able to see the film because we cannot afford to submit it to festivals. Any money you can give would mean the world to us. When we say every little help, we really do mean it.
Please do take a look through the perks we are offering for contributors! It's our way of saying thank you for helping us out and we appreciate the help so much.
If you don't have any money to spare but like the sound of our project and want to help we would be so thankful if you could tell people about Harry Metcalfe and help us spread the word.
If we could give all you contributors a hug we would!

<p>Il mestiere del Capitano racconta la storia umana e sportiva di Alessandro Lucarelli, il Capitano che ha riportato il Parma Calcio 1913 in Serie A conquistando tre promozioni consecutive e scrivendo un’impresa che non ha precedenti nella storia del calcio.

<p>“Il mio augurio è che in futuro quando qualcuno vi chiederà chi era Alessandro Lucarelli, voi possiate rispondere: uno di noi.” (Alessandro Lucarelli)</p>
<p>Il 22 giugno 2015, in seguito al fallimento societario, la storica squadra di calcio di Parma retrocede dalla Serie A agli inferi del calcio non professionistico: la categoria Dilettanti. La piccola grande squadra di provincia che ha fatto sognare gli amanti del calcio e che conta tantissimi tifosi e simpatizzanti in tutto il mondo, un pezzo di storia del calcio italiano - e non solo - rischia di essere cancellato per sempre.

<p>Il Capitano riparte dai malconci campi di provincia alla guida di un manipolo di giovani, sposando il progetto di calcio biologico del neonato Parma Calcio 1913.

<p>Il racconto parte dal fallimento societario del 2015 per poi fare un passo indietro e riassumere l’arrivo di Alessandro al Parma; la narrazione riprende l’andamento cronologico, mostrando tutto il percorso di risalita del club attraverso le serie minori e lanciando, in ultimo, un partecipe sguardo sul finale della stagione 2017/2018, che sarà anche l’ultima della carriera di Alessandro Lucarelli.</p>
<p>Il Capitano racconta le sue memorie ed emozioni, i suoi aneddoti e le curiosità, le difficoltà e le aspettative.

<p>In 2018, I was approached by a friend of the Ely family, whose 6-year old daughter Clara had just passed away to brain cancer, if I could curate a mural in her honour. Since Clara had attended PS9, in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn I suggested the mural be painted on the school premises.</p>
<p>After meeting with the principal of the school, she generously gave permission for use of one side of the school to paint the dedication mural. The mural started in May 2018 and took 1 month to complete. After the positive reaction of the school and community to the mural, I was approached by the PTO to expand the artwork on the entire school. Completed in October 2018, the S.T.E.A.M. mural project –named after the main themes it features, Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math– turned out to be one of the largest collections of mural street art in New York City.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560139893/cr7un1f23uf71vpw7ghu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As the STEAM Mural Project began to gain more popularity and publicity, more school districts began to show interest in bringing art onto their school grounds and into their diverse communities. At that point, I realised it would be necessary to film the murals and make a short video of the STEAM Mural Project so that other schools would see the optimistic messages and the inspiring, educational and socially-engaging artwork found on the walls of PS9.</p>
<p>A short while later, from a mutual friend, I met filmmaker <strong>Zaf (Zafeiris) Haitidis</strong>, who had recently relocated to Brooklyn from Athens, Greece. Following his years of documenting the Greek socioeconomic crisis as well as the refugee crisis in Europe, he was interested in getting involved with the New York street art scene. And, as has been the case throughout this emotional and artistic journey with Clara's Garden –which began with a mural in honour of little Clara, was followed up by the STEAM Mural Project which spread around PS9, and which then in turn began to expand into a mural movement across New York– so too, what began with a simple filming of the murals at PS9 and a few statements from 5-6 people involved with the Project, the initially-intended short video eventually started to grow in scope and began to blossom into a feature-length documentary.</p>

<p style=""text-align: right;"">(Clara Ely and her grandfather Mr. Robert Martin)</p>
<p>Clara and her courageous battle with brain cancer has been a ""seed"" of inspiration and unity, and a source of guiding light for all of us involved with Clara's Garden, the STEAM Mural Project and the mural movement that followed. Zaf and I are committed as artists and human beings to see to it that “Clara’s Legacy” comes to fruition in any shape or form.</p>

The attention from the wall has led to Jeff being the art curator for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's annual Chile Pepper Festival for the last two years. In 2017, Jeff was approached by a parent of a child who died of brain cancer to do a mural at her school, PS9. A few murals in her honour sparked a movement that has led to over 75 murals that cover the entire school. The attention has led to Jeff being contacted by other schools to spread the art to their walls.</p>

</div></div>","Clara’s Garden: 
An Ode to Love, Art and Comm-Unity!

In 2018, I was approached by a friend of the Ely family, whose 6-year old daughter Clara had just passed away to brain cancer, if I could curate a mural in her honour. Since Clara had attended PS9, in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn I suggested the mural be painted on the school premises.
After meeting with the principal of the school, she generously gave permission for use of one side of the school to paint the dedication mural. The mural started in May 2018 and took 1 month to complete. After the positive reaction of the school and community to the mural, I was approached by the PTO to expand the artwork on the entire school. Completed in October 2018, the S.T.E.A.M. mural project –named after the main themes it features, Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math– turned out to be one of the largest collections of mural street art in New York City.

As the STEAM Mural Project began to gain more popularity and publicity, more school districts began to show interest in bringing art onto their school grounds and into their diverse communities. At that point, I realised it would be necessary to film the murals and make a short video of the STEAM Mural Project so that other schools would see the optimistic messages and the inspiring, educational and socially-engaging artwork found on the walls of PS9.
A short while later, from a mutual friend, I met filmmaker Zaf (Zafeiris) Haitidis, who had recently relocated to Brooklyn from Athens, Greece. Following his years of documenting the Greek socioeconomic crisis as well as the refugee crisis in Europe, he was interested in getting involved with the New York street art scene. And, as has been the case throughout this emotional and artistic journey with Clara's Garden –which began with a mural in honour of little Clara, was followed up by the STEAM Mural Project which spread around PS9, and which then in turn began to expand into a mural movement across New York– so too, what began with a simple filming of the murals at PS9 and a few statements from 5-6 people involved with the Project, the initially-intended short video eventually started to grow in scope and began to blossom into a feature-length documentary.

(Clara Ely and her grandfather Mr. Robert Martin)
Clara and her courageous battle with brain cancer has been a ""seed"" of inspiration and unity, and a source of guiding light for all of us involved with Clara's Garden, the STEAM Mural Project and the mural movement that followed. Zaf and I are committed as artists and human beings to see to it that “Clara’s Legacy” comes to fruition in any shape or form.
 
What We Need
Crew/Gear: 30% / Production: 13% / Post-Production: 43%
Marketing: 3% / Rewards: 6% / Campaign Fees: 5%
We are trying to raise funds for two main purposes:
1) To complete production of this feature documentary, by covering expenses made to date by us, plus further expenses we can't cover ourselves, in order to:
a) Finish filming, including interviews of experts on paediatric cancer, some of which require out of town expenses, and aerial photography, b) Composition of an original music score, including recordings of real instruments in the orchestration, c) Complete post production process, including editing (3 months minimum); animation and motion graphics (to ""bring to life"" on screen certain of the STEAM murals and images from ""SuperClara""); sound design and sound mixing; plus other technical procedures (colour correction, digital master, etc), and d) Film festival expenses, including submission fees and marketing.
2) To help raise awareness in the fight to cure paediatric cancer, with all proceeds raised beyond this campaign’s goal being donated for that exact purpose to foundations such as “Bridge to a Cure Foundation,” founded by Clara’s grandfather, author and child advocate Mr. Robert Martin (“Bridge to a Cure Foundation”: https://bridgetoacure.org/).

Last year Less than 3% of dramas were directed by Scottish female talent!  Hindering us further is the fact we are also mothers. A blessing, of course, but when it comes to filmmaking, babies, on your hip, are a tricky addition.So we have decided that we have to find a way to do it on our own terms. We work when our children go to bed. We work while we are commuting to our day job, walking the dog or making the dinner.  Fortunately, we live in a world where all that is possible with shared drives and mobile phones.We believe passionately that women need to be both behind and in front of the camera if we are to have our voices heard.Chips is our first joint project and we are hoping it’s a small step towards changing the status quo here in Scotland.  Your support will allow us to take a crucial step forward. The money raised through this campaign will be used to fund the shooting costs as well as the post-production process: editing, colour correction, sound design and visual effects required to bring ‘Chips’ to lifeThe subject matter is close to our hearts. Nothing prepares you for losing a parent, but when it happens to you unexpectedly, it’s even more distressing.When my Dad died very suddenly, I was devastated. I never got the chance to say things I wanted to say and more importantly, I never got the chance to say goodbye.When the Arri Alexa Challenge announced that ‘Magic’ was their theme this year, I knew immediately what I wanted to make a film about. What if the magic of your imagination could help you find a way to say goodbye to a loved one you’ve lost?Daisy was there when my dad died. We are good friends as well as colleagues, so she was a great support to me. She dropped everything to look after my children the night it happened.When I told her what I wanted to make the film about she agreed one hundred percent. But, she pointed out that the key to film was to find the right device to tell the story. When learned that the competition theme for this year was magic, Daisy had a bolt out of the blue: she saw a child feeding the ashes of someone she loves to a goldfish. That’s when the concept for Chips was born.We are thrilled to say that our idea was selected for the Directors UK, ARRI Alexa Challenge 2019, meaning that we will be given the generous loan of a full ARRI Alexa camera kit, along with lighting equipment from Pinewood MBS Lighting.It will however take more than lights and camera for us to shout action. We need your support to make this film happen. THE LOCATIONSWe wanted the film to have a strong sense of place so we have set in a fishing village on the East coast of Scotland.  The exteriors of the fishing village and the harbour will be framed by the darkness of the North Sea. The trajectory of the Scottish winter sun will create a magical light which will be able to be captured to its full effect on the Arri Alexa.  We are striving to create a rich, filmic look and to reflect the light and shade of the story through the way we shoot the film. The distinctive character of the winter light in Scotland lends itself to a large-format look which we will achieve with the Arri Alexa and their lenses will help creative a cinematic look.In contrast, the interiors will feel empty and claustrophobic.  We will play with light and simple art direction to create the feeling that the child’s experience of grief mirrors that of the fish stuck in the bowl.The colour of the child’s hair and the colour of the goldfish will create a warm accent color in contrast to the bluey-grey exterior as well as the white empty interiors. The Arri Alexa will be able to give the richness and crispness of color and saturation this film needs to shine.The film will be shot in two days on location in Fife which is a place I spent a lot of my childhood with my Dad. There are two exterior and two interior locations all within close proximity. The cast is small with only one lead to keep the proposition achievable.   THE CHARACTERSSHAUNA: An introspective 10-year-old from a Scottish East coast fishing village.  She is not only struggling to process her loss but she feels abandoned by her mother who is also consumed by her grief. We watch as her mood moves from withdrawn and grief-stricken to joyful until the moment she thinks she’s lost  ‘Chips’ again.AILSA: Shauna’s Mother has struggled to bring her daughter up on her own and has been heavily reliant on her father’s support. It was something she never talked about with him because she felt ashamed that she had to go cap in hand to him when her marriage fell apart. It was a difficult relationship anyway.  When he died suddenly she realised she had never told him just how grateful she was for all his unquestioning love and support to herself and her daughter. She finds herself unable to cope with the loss and has nothing left to give to Shauna.CHIPS:  A devoted grandfather he adored Shauna feeling able to show her the affection he held back from his daughter. After her mother passed away he too had struggled with grief and had withdrawn from her just as she withdrew from Shauna. THE CASTSOPHIE LAWSON: Ten-year-old Sophie Lawson began performing in Stagecoach and has since graduated onto Glasgow’s Harlequin Youth Theatre, as well as dancing for the Scottish Ballet.I came across Sophie when I was doing drama with some kids at a local school. She really stood out from the crowd. This is her first film role and I feel sure she is perfect for the part.Casting is ongoing for Ailsa and Chips.

<li>Caleb Quinn and Danica Anna Uskert-Quinn are a husband and wife filmmaking team originally from San Francisco who now reside in LA.  They've been collaborating for years on experimental and narrative shorts that have been accepted into festivals such as VAULT Film Festival (UK), PFF Berlin, and PFF Vienna. </li>
<li>Danica is a mixed-race Asian American Pinay hapa and is committed to diversity in representation in film and film criticism.  Prior to this, her debut directorial feature, she was an executive producer on HP Mendoza's Filipino-American home-for-the-holidays LGBT dark comedy <strong>BITTER MELON</strong> (2018), is an associate producer on Richard Green's <strong>I KNOW CATHERINE</strong> (a documentary about Catherine Coulson, currently in post), and she continues to support diverse LGBTQIA writers and creators with her webzine about sex &amp; sexuality in cinema, <strong>Film &amp; Fishnets</strong> (<a href=""http://www.filmandfishnet.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.filmandfishnet.com</a>). </li>

<h3>The Film's Potential Impact:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>RAW NERVES</strong> is a chronicle of a San Francisco that no longer exists.  We shot in spaces like The Center for Sex &amp; Culture (which lost its physical location a few months ago &amp; can no longer afford to find a permanent home in SF), with an incredibly diverse LGBTQIA cast of actors and entertainers (many of whom also can no longer afford to live in the city).  It's a piece of local history, made by locals who deeply love the Bay Area and San Francisco...or at least the city it used to be.  Since the dot-com boom, the landscape of San Francisco--the architecture, the people, the culture--has been changing drastically.  Though all the newcomers to the city seem to welcome the sterile space it now is, any local will tell you, all the color has been wiped out.  <strong>RAW NERVES</strong> is a document of what the city was, briefly, and what it will never be again.</li>
<li>As mentioned earlier, Danica and Caleb are committed to diverse representation in cinema.  We made sure to use our debut to provide opportunities for an incredibly diverse array of up-and-coming young musicians, dancers and actors.  By supporting this project, you are also supporting cinematic diversity.  And not just diversity in casting--one of the filmmakers is, after all, an Asian-American woman (she's Filipina-Indian-Chinese-Spanish-Slovak, to be exact); our talented cinematographer Nicholas Nguyen is also Asian-American.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>By contributing to this movie, you are helping to make a place for cinema at it’s most fiercely independent, investing in creators who produce work without compromise or obligation to upper dictums.  It is a place without which art cannot exist.</p></li>
<li><p>As experimental filmmakers and fringe artists, we have been producing work without sponsorship for decades.  Each of our respective aesthetics push against the mainstream and exist in different margins of counter-cultural cinema.  Our strongly independent creative visions combine in this feature in the hopes of making a contribution to the conversation of mainstream storytelling in a way that audiences have never seen.</p></li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<ul>
<li>From the beginning, we knew we needed to have complete control over the project ourselves to achieve the kind of intimacy needed for such a personal story.  We decided to take a risk by hiring our good friend, Vietnamese-American cameraman and film scholar Nick Nguyen to shoot camera for us.  His eagerness for experimentation, openness to direction, and beaming energy shine through <strong>RAW NERVES</strong>.  The film wouldn't be what it is without his help.</li>
<li>We'd also like to thank our AD Danielle Ryan for flying from ATL to SF to assist with one of the more complicated sequences (and for keeping the set under control as Caleb experienced heart failure on the June shoot).</li>
<li>Inspired by Sean Baker's <strong>Tangerine</strong>, the film was shot entirely on an iPhone.  This non-invasive technique made exterior sequences much more natural, allowing for interaction with an urban environment while lending these scenes a swift, light-on-their-feet feeling.  At the same time, the deep focus allows for our packed production design to shine through during the interior sequences.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558556425/hc9sauhg6wkqkem6ktm7.png"" src=""""/></p>

<ul>
<li>We wrote this film together years ago, when we were falling in love, began production after we got married, stayed together after Caleb’s heart attack, and completed the film together as we were pulling through.  There are very real pieces of our lives in this.  But this story is not exactly us.  It is what we saved ourselves from becoming by making movies.</li>
<li>All of the challenges we faced on this movie, we faced for the first time.  We met them.  We will keep meeting them.</li>

RAW NERVES is a chronicle of a San Francisco that no longer exists.  We shot in spaces like The Center for Sex & Culture (which lost its physical location a few months ago & can no longer afford to find a permanent home in SF), with an incredibly diverse LGBTQIA cast of actors and entertainers (many of whom also can no longer afford to live in the city).  It's a piece of local history, made by locals who deeply love the Bay Area and San Francisco...or at least the city it used to be.  Since the dot-com boom, the landscape of San Francisco--the architecture, the people, the culture--has been changing drastically.  Though all the newcomers to the city seem to welcome the sterile space it now is, any local will tell you, all the color has been wiped out.  RAW NERVES is a document of what the city was, briefly, and what it will never be again.
As mentioned earlier, Danica and Caleb are committed to diverse representation in cinema.  We made sure to use our debut to provide opportunities for an incredibly diverse array of up-and-coming young musicians, dancers and actors.  By supporting this project, you are also supporting cinematic diversity.  And not just diversity in casting--one of the filmmakers is, after all, an Asian-American woman (she's Filipina-Indian-Chinese-Spanish-Slovak, to be exact); our talented cinematographer Nicholas Nguyen is also Asian-American.



By contributing to this movie, you are helping to make a place for cinema at it’s most fiercely independent, investing in creators who produce work without compromise or obligation to upper dictums.  It is a place without which art cannot exist.
As experimental filmmakers and fringe artists, we have been producing work without sponsorship for decades.  Each of our respective aesthetics push against the mainstream and exist in different margins of counter-cultural cinema.  Our strongly independent creative visions combine in this feature in the hopes of making a contribution to the conversation of mainstream storytelling in a way that audiences have never seen.




Risks & Challenges:

From the beginning, we knew we needed to have complete control over the project ourselves to achieve the kind of intimacy needed for such a personal story.  We decided to take a risk by hiring our good friend, Vietnamese-American cameraman and film scholar Nick Nguyen to shoot camera for us.  His eagerness for experimentation, openness to direction, and beaming energy shine through RAW NERVES.  The film wouldn't be what it is without his help.
We'd also like to thank our AD Danielle Ryan for flying from ATL to SF to assist with one of the more complicated sequences (and for keeping the set under control as Caleb experienced heart failure on the June shoot).
Inspired by Sean Baker's Tangerine, the film was shot entirely on an iPhone.  This non-invasive technique made exterior sequences much more natural, allowing for interaction with an urban environment while lending these scenes a swift, light-on-their-feet feeling.  At the same time, the deep focus allows for our packed production design to shine through during the interior sequences.




We wrote this film together years ago, when we were falling in love, began production after we got married, stayed together after Caleb’s heart attack, and completed the film together as we were pulling through.  There are very real pieces of our lives in this.  But this story is not exactly us.  It is what we saved ourselves from becoming by making movies.
All of the challenges we faced on this movie, we faced for the first time.  We met them.  We will keep meeting them.

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>Special Delivery is an NYU advanced film that uses the genres of action, crime, and comedy to tell the coming-of-age story of Anna and Danielle, two very different pizza delivery girls nearing adulthood. Anna has college dreams and struggles to balance her own goals with her father’s wishes, while Danielle works hard so that her family business thrives.  When their paths cross one fateful night in an expensive drug deal gone wrong, Anna finally has the opportunity to escape the rut she is in by mustering a bit of bravery and bending her moral code.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I’ve always loved movies that explore themes that we know in exciting world’s we do not. I would always go to film as a fun escape from boring, safe life while simultaneously falling into deeper touch with my own feelings. </p>
<p>Though this film’s plot is coincidental and heightened, I still want the characters to feel grounded in their struggles with family, morality, and survival. I want to explore these themes as they are close to my own life. Family is extremely important to me and the differences between them intrigue me. Growing up with my mother, aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents in the same house many times a year, I have been able to observe their relationships and compare them to my own experiences. Also, as a Catholic, I pay attention to its display in media and do not think the best way to incorporate religion into cinema is through films that seem to make the experience always glossy and miraculous. Though people may try with all their heart to remain true to their beliefs, high stress situations, difficulties, temptations, and dangers can cause commitment to falter and loopholes to be created.</p>
<p>Most action movies nowadays revolve around characters with extraordinary abilities whose only challenges relate to a world ending threat or matters of revenge. The most memorable characters though are the ones with whom we can relate, the John McClane’s, the average Joes who find themselves in a situation in which they cannot say no and need to step up. Many people need bare necessity to force them into drawing the courage to accomplish their goals. I personally find that my true desires come to the surface in my deepest lows. I hope others can relate to that too and that’s a feeling I want to convey in this film.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to make an action packed project in an action packed city, it requires a bit of dough (pun intended). NYU provides a solid $1300 dollars and camera bundle, but because of the scale of the project, locations, and the little details that add up to bring a film to life, we require more than that. We are seeking to raise $4,000 dollars in order to provide the necessary funding to make this world real and believable, while also making a set that is comfortable for the cast and crew. In the grand scheme of many student films, it’s not too much taking into account the multiple city locations, action set piece, and 4 day/night shooting schedule.</p>
<p>Your funding will go toward:</p> <p>- Transportation: 25%</p>
<p>- Locations: 24%</p>
<p>- Food: 19%</p>
<p>- Props: 16%</p>
<p>- Costumes: 4%</p>
<p>- Overhead: 12%</p> <p>No cent will be wasted and your contributions will not go unnoticed. Refer to the right side of the page for the gift you will receive based on your donation!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Shooting in the city always poses challenges related to time and space constraints. That is why we will be shooting over the course of 4 days and also allowing ample time for rehearsal and choreography before the actual shooting dates. I will be doing detailed storyboards and location scouts in order to make sure that every moment on this set is as safe and time efficient as possible. We are also in negotiations with pizza restaurants and a church that will allow us to film in their spaces.</p>

<h3><strong>My Story</strong></h3>
<p>The weather was rainy, fast winds blowing. Passengers were gripping their umbrellas firmly not to be swept away by the wind. The boy next door passed by on his bike and like always smiled at me. As soon as my mom noticed, she pulled my arm towards her as if she meant to detach it. I was just a little 6-year-old girl and in my sweet little world, I wondered ""why every time the neighbor's son smiles at me, my mom punishes me?”. I was in pain which was bitterly telling me not to ask. I looked back to see the boy while he was getting farther away but still kept looking back at me. My mom pinched my arm hard when she saw us looking at each other again. My arm was burning. I felt a big lump in my throat. The spot she pinched me was red for the next couple of days, then blue, and later green...</p>

<h3><strong>Synopsis</strong></h3>
<p>The sweet world of Mahi, a 12-year-old girl, gets shattered by the perception that she realizes from her mother’s wrong explanation in response to Mahi’s question, “How does a woman get pregnant?”. Mahi finds herself in a love triangle. Based on her mom’s answer she freaks out of being pregnant. A lunatic boy who never talks and another lover seem to assault Mahi sexually. Mahi suffers from a strange pain as she is around menarche. Her parents keep ignoring her physical and emotional changes while she hits puberty so Mahi is struggling with violence, punishment, isolation, ignorance, and abuse. Evelina, afraid of getting pregnant, suffers from unwanted pregnancy. Mahi and Evelina don't know each other but suffer from the same problem. They are two women with entwined lives.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Edoardo, the writer and director of ""Room 208"". I come from Milan, Italy and my passion for film brought me to study in London at Met Film School, where I am attending the 2 year BA in Film-making.  Between 2017 and 2018 I attended a course at Central Film School, where I learnt the basics of practical film-making. I have a great love for cinema, especially the art of storytelling and I hope I will get a chance to share my stories.</p>
<p>The story is about a dilemma, revenge vs forgiveness. Vincent is seeking revenge for the death of his wife. Dennis, who accidentally killed her in a car accident, is suffering due to his sense of guilt. When Vincent is about to kill Dennis, he finds him about to take his own, and recognizing his huge sense of guilt, he understands that the best revenge is forgiveness. Dennis sinks in his desperation and kills himself.</p>
<p>I am very passionate about this story because I think, in certain degrees, it can apply to all of us. We have all been hurt by someone at some point in our lives and we've had the desire of getting back at them. Hopefully with this story, when people will find themselves in a similar situation, they will take a step back and get out of their head for a moment to understand that also that person is or will suffer for what he did. We all have a consciousness and we all pay for ourselves for what we did.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The short film is set in a hotel.  We decided to re-create the hotel in a set for two reasons: it will give us more freedom as we can make the room bigger, secondly it will end up being less expensive as we would have to book two rooms for three days, one room for the shooting and one for the equipment. Most of the funding would go into building the hotel room, the corridor and the reception. We will have to buy dry walls, furniture and small props to give authenticity to the location. In total we will need about 500-600£ for all these expenses. In addition I would like to bring the actors in for a day of rehearsal, which would come to an additional cost of 200£.</p>
<p>I am very passionate about film-making but above all, about telling stories. Men have been telling stories for thousands of years. We used sit around campfires and share with each other our experiences. I think that nothing much has changed since then, it's just the medium that we are using that has. This is the feeling that I want to give to the audience, like we are all sitting around a campfire listening to a story that can help us to forget the outside world for a brief moment.</p>
<p>This is a low budget short film and any contribution will be extremely helpful. Creativity comes from being able of finding a solution in limiting circumstances. So, even if I won't reach the entire goal, I will still try and use what I have at my dispose to complete the film.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With this project, I'm trying to use many different influences in cinema history to build a better film. I still tried to find an idea that felt different, with a different perspective, but at the same time using films that have already been made to help me bring this idea to life. By doing this I think I will hope that the viewer will still be entertained and will gain a new perspective.</p>
<p>I have previously written and directed one short film called: ""The Last Night"". It was my first ever project and it helped gain experience in making a film. I know feel much more confident in managing the set and finding quick solutions whenever there is a problem.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the main challenges I might face is in the production design. Because we have to build the whole set, it might not look realistic enough and one of the main obstacles to achieve this goal is time and money. Although the production designer assigned to the project is extremely talented and capable, with your help, I believe we will be able to exceed our expectations.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are reading this passage, first of all, thank you for your time. Just the fact you read all of it it means a lot for all of us.

If you still like the concept of the project, please share this page with your contact on Facebook and on Instagram.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Miranda Powers, and I am an actress residing in New York City. I moved to New York from Missouri on my journey to obtain my MFA from The New School for Drama, and one big student loan later, I achieved a major dream, an MFA in Acting. But now what? I have had the idea for my microshorts for over a year. I meet so many unique individuals in this city and while most are surprisingly kind and full of heart, the inconsiderate are on a whole other level, something that never feels real. Like your favorite Looney Tunes character, only mean. These people are way over the top in their aggression, entitlement, jaded ways, and confidence in their douchebag tendencies. There's comedic gold in that! In my microfilm series I will highlight everything I have learned from observing theses individuals in the most comedic way possible. But I can't do it without your help! I have big goals for this project. Getting my micros to film festivals and other top platforms. To produce this project with no shortcuts, it will take a team of professional artists and a cup of tea or two. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am funding $4,400 to begin with a potential stretch goal if people are just as excited about this project as I am. This $4,400 will produce the first three episodes in the series. That's about $1,446.00 per episode. Where will the funds go?</p>
<p>Ideally, the shoot for the three films will take place in two days over three different locations. An assistant director will keep me on track and will help keep everyone else on track as well. <strong>The pay for the AD is $300.00 for two days. </strong></p>
<p>I will be directing most of the episodes but it is essential I hire a Director of Photography/ cinematographer. They will be in charge of the artistic and technical decisions related to the image and operation of the camera. (We will be shooting on a Sony a6300 that is free to use). <strong>This role will be paid $500.00 for two days. </strong></p>
<p>I will be hiring two actors to help me with this series. They will get paid according to SAG Low Budget rate. $125.00 a day times two for two days. <strong>$500.00 total. </strong></p>
<p>I need someone to help with sound. This is essential because we will be in some public settings where the sound will be a mess. I am hiring someone who will operate sound equipment they own,  <strong>$400.00 for two days. </strong></p>
<p>Lighting will be a must. I have to rent the equipment, again looking at someone who owns to the rate is cheaper. <strong>For two days, $400.00.</strong></p>
<p>I have to feed and caffeinate my team while we will work non-stop for two days. <strong>$350.00 will cover breakfast, snacks, and lunch. </strong>The goal is to work 7 am to 5 pm so dinner will not need to be provided. </p>
<p>Post editing I will be doing the majority of the editing with an assistant editor. <strong>Rate is $350.00.</strong></p>
<p>I need to hire a colorist who can make sure the color across the film is the same and looks stunning. <strong>$250.00 for this.</strong></p>
<p>Music can make or break a film. I will need to hire a composer who can put together something that will work for my project. <strong>$400.00 is the rate to create something from scratch for three different episodes.</strong></p>
<p>Film festivals are expensive to submit to an can be hard to know which one is a good fit for your project. I will be hiring a consultant to watch my series and talk with me about my festival expectations so they can guide me to the festivals that will be a good fit for me.<strong> The rate is $250.00. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The festival budget is $700.00.</strong> I am taking this microfilm series seriously. Submissions will be made to multiple festivals to show everyone what we have created and get people buzzing about the microseries. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I have some awesome perks to help with motivation to get this project moving and shaking! </strong></p>
<p>For a <strong>$15 donation</strong>, I will send you a postcard with a recent experience I have had with an asshole.</p>
<p>For a <strong>$30 donation</strong>, I will make a video shout out explaining why you are not an asshole and post it on Twitter and Instagram. </p>
<p>For a <strong>$60 donation</strong>, I will email you behind the scene production photos once we have the shoot and do a video shout out explaining why you are not an asshole and post it on Twitter and Instagram. </p>
<p>For a <strong>$100 donation</strong>, you will get a blooper reel! All the funny footage, brilliant mistakes, and any asshole moments captured that don't make it into the film will be sent to you after the shoot to watch. </p>
<p>For a<strong> $250 donation</strong>, you will get a special thanks listed in the credit at the end of one of the How to be an Asshole episodes.</p>
<p>For a <strong>$500 donation</strong>, you will be given an Associate Producer credit! Your name will be listed after every episode in the credits with your title.</p>
<p>For <strong>$1,000 donation</strong>, you will be given an Executive Producer credit as well as all the perks listed above as well as a custom thank you video from me and some of the cast and crew, an entry from my personal journal that I have kept tracking interesting people I have met across NYC, and a signed script from the first episode. </p>

<p>Jill , Matthew, Miranda met at Graduate school and became the perfect comedic trio. They trained together for three years where they learned to work well with the quirks and spontaneity they provided as a team.  They love working with each other and are trust each other to be big and bold in their comedic work! They have worked on several projects together and are so excited for this project. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's not enough anymore to point a finger at someone and explain politely why they are being rude and how it is not okay. Its time to get extreme and make comedy out of the most horrible moments people have. Lets create something together that will shine a light on some monstrous human behavior and make people think... with a laugh! </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Don't freak out over the name of the series!!!</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>I've had talks with people on if the title of my microseries, ""How to be an Asshole,"" is too much. Verdict - NOPE! For film festivals, the name of the series is just fine and is a major context clue as to what the style of comedy is. When I pitch this series to Insta/YouTube/Facebook TV, the series title can be up for negotiation with some back up titles like ""You suck and here's why,"" or "" How to be a horrible human being,"" etc. And remember - this is a comedy! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>One major challenge with this project is having a good time making the comedy without offending people. No jokes will be made targeting specific individuals using their specific names. No jokes will be made to purposely be insensitive to any gender or ethnic groups. We may joke about being assholes, but we are not assholes. </p>
<p>It is our goal to hire a diverse group of cast and crew. In my writing process I have had a team of diverse people who read my scripts to make sure the jokes are not harmful. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't help with money? I get that. I am in so much debt with my student loans, <i>that</i> should be made into a comedy. But there is another vital way to help me out. </p>
<p>Please use Indiegogo's share tools and make some noise about my campaign. Lets start a spark and blaze this project! You can also follow me on social media and I will follow back. Post about my project and I am happy to post about yours too. We're a community for a reason :)</p>

<h2><strong>Logline:</strong></h2>
<p>Prodigal(s), a drama thriller, follows Regan White and her four best friends as they run away to her boyfriend Seth’s ranch. After discovering things aren’t what they seem, Regan has to fight her way out learning that forgiveness is the only way to be truly set free.</p>
<h2><strong>Synopsis:</strong></h2>
<p>After the death of her mother, Regan White, an innocent small-town girl from Texas, has grown to hate her father. One day her four outcast friends decided they want to run away to her boyfriend Seth’s ranch. A place he used to live with his father until he died. Regan initially refuses but after a final argument with her father, Regan decides she belongs with them. So, one morning, they run away. They get to the ranch and begin to have a blast. They are finally free.</p>
<p>But one day Regan stumbles upon something she shouldn’t have seen, something bad. Bad enough to want to go back home. But her friends won’t let her leave; what she has seen can get her in trouble. So now Regan is trapped on a ranch by her “friends”. Things begin to get worse and worse, and eventually push Regan to fight her way out.</p>
<p>At the same time her father, who has been looking for her, stumbles upon the Ranch. Both her and her father fight their way out trying to escape death. </p>
<h2><strong>Why are we making this?</strong></h2>
<p>The film deals heavily with how people attempt to deal with pain in their life. It’s the entire reason Regan runs away. People often turn towards the wrong things to deal with their pain. It never truly heals them, but instead makes things worse. We believe the only way to truly deal with hurt and pain is to forgive those who have hurt you. This isn’t an easy concept for most people, but it is the truth. A person can never truly be healed if they haven’t forgiven. That’s what the film is about. That’s why we are telling this story. To show the world that Forgiveness and Love are always available, to everyone. We want people to know they are loved, and know they are forgiven. All you have to do is ask.</p>
</div><div>

Everything after that goes to making the film as best it can be. We want to insure you get the best film you possibly can. So we need the $70,000 in order to insure that will happen. But as long as we have $10,000, the film is happening!</p>
<p>*Whether or not we reach our goal you will receive the perks you have purchased after the film is completed.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>

Along with this all phone calls will happen after the release also because right now we are focused on making the best film possible.</p>
<p>We know this is a long way away but it will be worth the wait! This movie is going to be unlike anything you have ever seen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Your Contribution Matters</h3>
<p>Film is a powerful art form. It is one of the only art forms where multiple art forms are combined together. Music, images, spoken word, light, and so much more are all key aspects of film. This gives film the power to move people like nothing else. Because of this, film has a responsibility to push for a better world. It has a responsibility to move people to a better version of themselves. And that is exactly the purpose of Prodigal(s). It's to show people that healing is just around the corner. All they have to do is ask. Forgiveness heals, and I want the world to know this.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you are helping this message be spread. You are helping show people that no matter where they are in life, they can always come back home. That is powerful.  Help us show people that they do not have to live in their past, but they can look forward to the future.</p>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>My name is Stephen Fritschle, I have been inside of the film industry for 13 years and have been directing for 10 of them. I have directed so many different things over the years, mainly narrative shorts, but also done things like freelance videography, music videos, promotional videos, teasers, advertisements, and Indie Gogo videos. My work has been seen in multiple festivals and I have gotten the chance to learn under some of the top professionals in this industry. I have an Associates Degree from the Los Angeles Film School which is one of the top production schools in the nation.</p>
<p>I have spent so many years doing so many different things it finally came time to make this feature. So that is what I am doing. I have spent over a year and a half working on this and I am confident it's going to be incredible. My team also has been working tirelessly on this film to make sure it is the best it can possibly be.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are quite a few challenges we will have to overcome in order to make this film happen, but the big one is time. We only have two weeks on our location to shoot an entire feature. That is not a lot of time. This means my team and I have to be as prepared as possible. We want to have every aspect of the film figured out before we get to the location so that we can execute with minor issues. We have been preparing for months now, and I am sure we will be able to fit everything into our short window.</p>
<p>This film falls under the category of ""Run and Gun"". Basically that means it is going to be a small crew, with a short amount a time, with a small budget. The problems that could occurs are endless. Here is the good news: ""Run and Gun"" is what I have been doing for 10 years! The world of fast moving sets and small crews on small budgets is my home. I know how to handle every problem that will come our way, and I am prepared to face then head on.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Godiva Films</strong> is a London based Indie film production company, founded by Simon Rickards, who studied film making at university and has worked in television and film for many years, at Cineworld, Arqiva, BBC and Sky TV. </p>
<p><strong>Godiva Films</strong> is particularly passionate about social realism and drama and makes high quality films with interesting and compelling story lines.  We have made around 15 short films and won several awards.  With this level of experience and success, we felt the time was right to make our first feature film!  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561331161/jrhb7p8apbt0qba0ygbt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>""BRITISH MADE"" </strong></i>took shape as the political and societal landscape began to change whilst stories of lone men embarking on random killing sprees continued to make the news, in Britain and overseas.  The script weaved all these factors into a single story of a right-wing extremist, who is released from prison and tries to rebuild his life.  We raise important and controversial issues in the film but it is also very watchable, compelling and full of suspense.</p>
<p>The cast and crew worked extremely hard to make <strong><i>""BRITISH MADE""</i></strong> often working 10-12 hours a day in the cold and wet.  We are all very experienced in film-making but no-one was paid and everyone had other day jobs to help pay the bills.  This hard work and team spirit has produced a strong and thought-provoking film with excellent performances and high production values. </p>
<p>Our film has been very well received so far - we have been accepted in festivals in <strong>America</strong> (Indie Visions in Charlottesville), <strong>Rome </strong>(Prisma)<strong> </strong>and <strong>Madrid</strong> (Madriff) and are thrilled to have also won many awards at the <strong>SFAAF Festival, Chile</strong>, including <strong><u>Best Film</u></strong>, <u><strong>Best Director</strong></u> and <u><strong>Best Lead Actor</strong></u>.  We now need funds for more festival submissions which specialise in low-budget films of this genre, such as <strong>Raindance</strong> and <strong>Slamdance</strong>.  This will provide exposure to the film and allow it to be screened - having worked so hard to produce the film, we are keen for audiences to see it!</p>
<p>Your contributions will be used for the application fees and any other directly associated costs (such as professional printing of press packs and marketing material) - we will only use the funds for legitimate film festival costs.  We are very grateful for any and all contributions and would not be able to take the film any further without your help.  <strong>Thank you very much</strong>.   </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need <strong>2,000 GBP</strong> for submitting to approximately 120 film festivals worldwide - this may seem like a huge number, but it is similar to bands performing in lots of small clubs and pubs to get exposure and a solid following.  Distributors and promoters attend small film festivals and the more we enter, the higher our chance of being seen by industry influencers.  </p>
<p>Application fees range from $10 to over $100 each and some processes require additional upfront membership fees of $100.  Professional printing costs of press packs and marketing material are estimated at 500 GBP.</p>
<ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Godiva Films is a London based Indie film production company, founded by Simon Rickards, who studied film making at university and has worked in television and film for many years, at Cineworld, Arqiva, BBC and Sky TV. 
Godiva Films is particularly passionate about social realism and drama and makes high quality films with interesting and compelling story lines.  We have made around 15 short films and won several awards.  With this level of experience and success, we felt the time was right to make our first feature film!  

""BRITISH MADE"" took shape as the political and societal landscape began to change whilst stories of lone men embarking on random killing sprees continued to make the news, in Britain and overseas.  The script weaved all these factors into a single story of a right-wing extremist, who is released from prison and tries to rebuild his life.  We raise important and controversial issues in the film but it is also very watchable, compelling and full of suspense.
The cast and crew worked extremely hard to make ""BRITISH MADE"" often working 10-12 hours a day in the cold and wet.  We are all very experienced in film-making but no-one was paid and everyone had other day jobs to help pay the bills.  This hard work and team spirit has produced a strong and thought-provoking film with excellent performances and high production values. 
Our film has been very well received so far - we have been accepted in festivals in America (Indie Visions in Charlottesville), Rome (Prisma) and Madrid (Madriff) and are thrilled to have also won many awards at the SFAAF Festival, Chile, including Best Film, Best Director and Best Lead Actor.  We now need funds for more festival submissions which specialise in low-budget films of this genre, such as Raindance and Slamdance.  This will provide exposure to the film and allow it to be screened - having worked so hard to produce the film, we are keen for audiences to see it!
Your contributions will be used for the application fees and any other directly associated costs (such as professional printing of press packs and marketing material) - we will only use the funds for legitimate film festival costs.  We are very grateful for any and all contributions and would not be able to take the film any further without your help.  Thank you very much.   


What We Need & What You Get
We need 2,000 GBP for submitting to approximately 120 film festivals worldwide - this may seem like a huge number, but it is similar to bands performing in lots of small clubs and pubs to get exposure and a solid following.  Distributors and promoters attend small film festivals and the more we enter, the higher our chance of being seen by industry influencers.  
Application fees range from $10 to over $100 each and some processes require additional upfront membership fees of $100.  Professional printing costs of press packs and marketing material are estimated at 500 GBP.

You can contribute any amount - however large or small - it all really helps! 
We are able to offer some rewards or perks for particular contributions - please see below.......
For those who contribute 350 pounds, you will get a 'crew for hire' and be able to star in your own short film!
For the first 2 people to contribute 65 pounds, you will get a copy of the ""BRITISH MADE"" Script, signed by the lead actors and Director

For the first 2 people to contribute 50 pounds, you will get a copy of the ""BRITISH MADE"" Storyboard, signed by the lead actors and Director

For the first 10 people who contribute 25 pounds, you will get a copy of a ""BRITISH MADE"" flyer, signed by the lead actors and Director

<li>ART BUDGET: This project relies heavily on sets, props and costumes to make our cinematic world believable. Ranging from making custom outfits, to building sound stages, to designing other insane surprises, our art budget is essential.</li>
<li>FOOD BUDGET: It takes a lot to feed the hardworking cast &amp; crew, especially on a feature film. And food keeps people happy and creative. We’re filming FOUR 12-hour days every week for 6 weeks this summer. That’s a lot of food!</li>
<li>EDITING BUDGET: With the cameras we’re using, our high-quality footage takes up a LOT of space. To keep our footage safe and backed-up, we need storage hard-drives to make sure all our hard work is never lost or broken. This could literally make or break whether this film can be completed!</li>
<li>FESTIVALS: At the end of it all, this movie would never be able to thrive without donations to help us submit to film festivals across America.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Emma Bright and I am directing <i>San Miguel de los Baños</i>. I had the opportunity to travel to Havana, Cuba in March of 2018 with my filmmaking partner, Justin Kappy Schmidt. In Havana, we spent a week working with local filmmakers including Wendy García Castellanos. </p>
<p>For this project, we will be traveling to San Miguel, Cuba which features the ruins of a spa resort known for the healing properties of its water. When these healing properties were discovered by a slave named Miguel, the town quickly built hotels and businesses thinking this would lead to a popular tourist destination. This resort was up and running in the early-mid 1900s but all businesses closed shortly after during the revolution. The giant Balneario or ""Gran Hotel"" still stands today along with many of the water wells but all are slowly disintegrating. Other ruins are being used to house the homeless. </p>
<p>I feel that I have struck gold by crossing paths with Wendy. She grew up in the village of San Miguel and suggested this story to me. This is one of those stories that come about only a couple times in documentary filmmaker's lives, if you're lucky. Cuban and American ties have been up in the air for decades but remain open for now. The buildings, like the Balneario, are falling apart and the locals who witness the birth of the spa resort are getting older. Our subject, Olegario Leal Amaro, 96 years old, grew up in the village as a construction worker.</p>
<p>Cubans are dedicated to maintaining what they possess in the best way they can with very little resources. They depend greatly on tourist spendings to get by. I am trying to imagine how better off the village of San Miguel would be if the resort wouldn't had been bought by the government. I am also curious as to why the Balneario or any of the other structures in San Miguel were never refurbished and were left to disintegrate.</p>
<p>Our mission for this project is to uncover the mysteries and sadness of a crumbling reality as a result of little emotional and physical care. We are a group of diverse student filmmakers collaborating to grow as storytellers and international partners. We are passionate about immersing ourselves in the town of San Miguel to tell the story of how this town was transformed from a popular vacation spot to one of the lowest income areas of Cuba.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Money raised through this campaign ($5000 or more) will cover the cost of our roundtrip airfares for Emma, Justin, and Ryan, visas, production insurance, our extra luggage fees for equipment and personal items, a rental house in San Miguel for 20 days, food for the three of us and Wendy, transportation to and from the Matanzas and San Miguel, and production expenses like a hard drive, outlet converter, and SD cards.</p>
<p>We want to give back to our contributors because this project means the world to us.</p>
<p>If you donate...</p>
<p>$15 you will be included in the 'special thanks' section of the film's credits</p>
<p>$20 you will receive a direct download link of the completed video (Spring 2020) </p>
<p>$30 a 4"" x 6"" photograph of my choice from my first trip to Havana</p>
<p>$35 a  4"" x 6"" photograph of your choice from my first trip to Havana (see <a href=""https://emmabrightvisuals.com/cuba-2018"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://emmabrightvisuals.com/cuba-2018</a>) </p>
<p>$40 two 4"" x 6""photographs of your choice from my first trip to Havana</p>
<p>$45 a 8.5"" x 11"" photograph of my choice from my first trip to Havana</p>
<p>$50 a 8.5"" x 11"" photograph of your choice from my first trip to Havana</p>
<p>$60 a 8.5"" x 11"" photograph of the <i>Balneario </i>Hotel taken by Wendy</p>
<p>$65 a 8.5""x 11"" and 4"" x 6"" of your choice (<i>Balneario </i>or from my last trip)</p>
<p>$70 two 8.5""x 11"" photographs of your choice (<i>Balneario </i>or from my last trip)</p>
<p>$100 you will receive an authentic Cuban gift after production and two 8.5""x 11"" photographs of your choice</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All donations above $15.00 will receive a special thanks in the credits.</p>
<p>All donations above $20.00 will receive a direct download link of the completed video (Spring 2020).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal through this campaign we will still graciously put all the money made towards our trip. We are working on applying for small grants and scholarships in addition of this. We appreciate any and all amounts you can contribute.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your help will make it possible for this production to take place this summer. If we don't receive enough funding and can't go this summer, I will have less time to shoot during the fall and possibly a downsize in crew. It is very important to me that our crew takes our time during production so we are able to take everything in and capture all that we need in twenty days. </p>
<p>My photograph ""Manicura"" taken in Havana, Cuba won 2nd place in the Annual May Gallery Juried Competition last spring. Justin and I have worked together on several projects. Our film The Boy with the Red Ballon: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjvAUhjP46A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjvAUhjP46A</a> was featured in the St. Louis Filmmakers Showcase last summer.  My Director of Photography, Ryan Fitzgerald, has an abundance of professional international travel having traveled to Argentina, Ireland, and Italy with the Higher Education Channel. He has also had two films in the St. Louis Filmmakers Showcase. The Joy of Doing was also screened during the St. Louis International Film Festival: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/165468139"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/165468139</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our safety is our number one concern when traveling to Cuba. Wendy's aunt and uncle still live in San Miguel so they will be there to offer emergency support if needed. They are also providing a house for us to rent from them in San Miguel so we don't have to travel back and forth from the nearest major city (Matanzas) each day.</p>
<p>The language barrier is a small concern but we plan to have a translator with us. Justin and I have also been taking Spanish classes at Webster University throughout this past school year.</p>
<p>Our final concern is getting permission to film inside these abandoned buildings. Wendy visited San Miguel a few weeks ago and didn't have a problem entering and photographing them. She is working with her school, Instituto Superior de Arte, on obtaining permits to guarantee film access while we are there.</p>
<p> </p>

$100 you will receive an authentic Cuban gift after production and two 8.5""x 11"" photographs of your choice
 
All donations above $15.00 will receive a special thanks in the credits.
All donations above $20.00 will receive a direct download link of the completed video (Spring 2020).
 
If we do not reach our goal through this campaign we will still graciously put all the money made towards our trip. We are working on applying for small grants and scholarships in addition of this. We appreciate any and all amounts you can contribute.
 

The Impact
Your help will make it possible for this production to take place this summer. If we don't receive enough funding and can't go this summer, I will have less time to shoot during the fall and possibly a downsize in crew. It is very important to me that our crew takes our time during production so we are able to take everything in and capture all that we need in twenty days. 
My photograph ""Manicura"" taken in Havana, Cuba won 2nd place in the Annual May Gallery Juried Competition last spring. Justin and I have worked together on several projects. Our film The Boy with the Red Ballon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjvAUhjP46A was featured in the St. Louis Filmmakers Showcase last summer.  My Director of Photography, Ryan Fitzgerald, has an abundance of professional international travel having traveled to Argentina, Ireland, and Italy with the Higher Education Channel. He has also had two films in the St. Louis Filmmakers Showcase. The Joy of Doing was also screened during the St. Louis International Film Festival: https://vimeo.com/165468139. 
 

Risks & Challenges
Our safety is our number one concern when traveling to Cuba. Wendy's aunt and uncle still live in San Miguel so they will be there to offer emergency support if needed. They are also providing a house for us to rent from them in San Miguel so we don't have to travel back and forth from the nearest major city (Matanzas) each day.
The language barrier is a small concern but we plan to have a translator with us. Justin and I have also been taking Spanish classes at Webster University throughout this past school year.
Our final concern is getting permission to film inside these abandoned buildings. Wendy visited San Miguel a few weeks ago and didn't have a problem entering and photographing them. She is working with her school, Instituto Superior de Arte, on obtaining permits to guarantee film access while we are there.

<h3>The Unknown Story of Two Black Women Artists</h3>
<p>I am an award-winning filmmaker whose documentaries have aired on public television stations nationwide and have been screened throughout the U.S. and abroad. At a Washington, D.C. history conference, a striking modernist painting on a brochure cover caught my eye. The painting was entitled <i>Third and Rhode Island.</i> The artist was Hilda Wilkinson Brown. Intrigued by the painting and curious about its creator, I set out to find out what I could about the artist.</p>
<p>My search led me to Wilkinson Brown's niece, abstract artist Lilian Thomas Burwell. Wilkinson Brown had died in 1981; but Burwell, who is 92, was a fount of information about her aunt, who had inspired and encouraged her own career as an artist and educator. Initially planning a documentary about Wilkinson Brown, I expanded my project to include Burwell as I realized how interlocked the two women's lives had been.</p>
<p>Hilda Wilkinson Brown created striking modernistic paintings which portrayed Washington, D.C.'s historic LeDroit Park neighborhood, linoleum block prints depicting African-American families, watercolors of Oak Bluffs in Martha's Vineyard, and illustrations for <i>The Brownies' Book</i> - the first magazine for black children - and for <i>The Crisis</i> - the official magazine of the NAACP.  In her 92nd year, Burwell is experiencing a wave of recognition for her ""sculptural paintings"": wooden sculptures carved and shaped from sugar pine and covered with a painted canvas.</p>
<p><i>Kindred Spirits:  Artists Hilda Wilkinson Brown and Lilian Thomas Burwell </i>will open people's eyes to the impressive body of work of two underrecognized black women artists and will uncover the historical, economic, and social conditions that shaped their lives, their artwork and their careers.  Much of the artwork featured in the film has rarely been exhibited and will now be available to the public. Through the personal accounts of Lilian Thomas Burwell, other artists and historians, viewers will learn about the challenges and obstacles African-American artists faced during the era of segregation, the opportunities they had to create for themselves to exhibit their work, and the themes that inspired both of these women's artwork. Their stories will bring to life people's experiences and perspectives and preserve important moments in history that would otherwise be lost.</p>

<p> Moving to America from India in 2017 was the biggest, most terrifying and challenging step I’d ever taken. I arrived here with 20 years if my life packed into two suitcases, a heart full of passion for film and a head full of dreams. Life as a college student quickly taught me that it truly is a fight to the finish. From sleepless nights due to homesickness, homework, or overnight shoots, to befriending other international students, and falling in love, my life here has taught me valuable lessons and ones that I’ll always cherish.</p>
<p> Up until the summer of 2018, with Nicholas Sparks as my inspiration, I’d dreamed of making the biggest, most amazing rom-com ever. (Head full of dreams, remember?). My experience as a Producer since then taught me that even the smallest films need a sizable budget. Since then, my focus shifted to telling a story that wasn’t necessarily the biggest in the budget, but the biggest at heart.</p>
<p>  Being in an interracial relationship myself, I want to make this film for all the mixed couples, families and children out there. For all the people that have spent most of their lives quietly fighting for the love, they’ve found in unlikely places. For all the biracial people who are disrespected and discriminated against. For all the young biracial couples who are judged by the color of their skin. For the colored women of the world fighting to mark their spot in this industry.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I want to make this film for myself. I have invested so much time and love into this story and it is one amongst others have created that echo today’s need for racial empathy and open-mindedness. A film that talks about diversity without saying a word about race.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562683721/gbudrrdgegynjjf6gehc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I am Natasha Sequeira, a filmmaker from a little city called Chennai, 9041.57222 miles away from Atlanta. Some of you may know me from my time growing up in Chennai, you may have gone to college with me at MOP Vaishnav, or some of you know me from my recent years in Atlanta. I’ve met some of you through traveling, mutual friends, MUN conferences, or other social media, and some of you may not know me at all! I'm the introverted Anglo-Indian girl from Chennai who happened to fall in love with filmmaking. Growing up in a conservative society, I hardly imagined I’d be making a career out of filmmaking. I started out (as most Indians do) veering towards engineering. When I realized I could never spend my days at a desk working on codes, I went back to my filmmaking. With the help of loving and supportive family and the blessings of God, I received my letter of acceptance into SCAD Atlanta, where I’ve spent the last two years writing, directing and producing video content. When I started writing short stories and poems back in the 5th grade, I never imagined I’d filming something I wrote in America. I’ve loved writing, producing films from scratch and filming with my friends. Creating is my outlet and is what truly makes me happy. When I'm not working on film projects, I'm likely hanging out with my rabbit, watching TV/movies with Michael (my boyfriend/co-writer/editor), or reading books to find more inspiration.</p>

If you are not able to help financially, sharing my campaign on social media or liking/following Beyond Customs on Instagram is also a HUGE help. If you know someone who loves family stories, is in an interracial relationship/family, share this with them! We live during an amazing time where sharing is as easy as tapping or clicking a couple of buttons. Your support would mean the WORLD to me!</p>
<p>With our unique perks you have the chance to receive a special thanks in the credits, a digital copy of the film, a Beyond Customs t-shirt, and/or a private screening.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds will still be used to pay for the bare necessities such as food for the crew, travel and to pay for locations. In the past films that I’ve produced have been nominated for the Southeast Student Emmy’s, the Lift-Off Sessions and have won festival accolades. ‘Beyond Customs’ will be submitted to more of such festivals and with your help, will be a top contender!</p>

</div></div>","Moving to America from India in 2017 was the biggest, most terrifying and challenging step I’d ever taken. I arrived here with 20 years if my life packed into two suitcases, a heart full of passion for film and a head full of dreams. Life as a college student quickly taught me that it truly is a fight to the finish. From sleepless nights due to homesickness, homework, or overnight shoots, to befriending other international students, and falling in love, my life here has taught me valuable lessons and ones that I’ll always cherish.
 Up until the summer of 2018, with Nicholas Sparks as my inspiration, I’d dreamed of making the biggest, most amazing rom-com ever. (Head full of dreams, remember?). My experience as a Producer since then taught me that even the smallest films need a sizable budget. Since then, my focus shifted to telling a story that wasn’t necessarily the biggest in the budget, but the biggest at heart.
  Being in an interracial relationship myself, I want to make this film for all the mixed couples, families and children out there. For all the people that have spent most of their lives quietly fighting for the love, they’ve found in unlikely places. For all the biracial people who are disrespected and discriminated against. For all the young biracial couples who are judged by the color of their skin. For the colored women of the world fighting to mark their spot in this industry.
Most importantly, I want to make this film for myself. I have invested so much time and love into this story and it is one amongst others have created that echo today’s need for racial empathy and open-mindedness. A film that talks about diversity without saying a word about race.

I am Natasha Sequeira, a filmmaker from a little city called Chennai, 9041.57222 miles away from Atlanta. Some of you may know me from my time growing up in Chennai, you may have gone to college with me at MOP Vaishnav, or some of you know me from my recent years in Atlanta. I’ve met some of you through traveling, mutual friends, MUN conferences, or other social media, and some of you may not know me at all! I'm the introverted Anglo-Indian girl from Chennai who happened to fall in love with filmmaking. Growing up in a conservative society, I hardly imagined I’d be making a career out of filmmaking. I started out (as most Indians do) veering towards engineering. When I realized I could never spend my days at a desk working on codes, I went back to my filmmaking. With the help of loving and supportive family and the blessings of God, I received my letter of acceptance into SCAD Atlanta, where I’ve spent the last two years writing, directing and producing video content. When I started writing short stories and poems back in the 5th grade, I never imagined I’d filming something I wrote in America. I’ve loved writing, producing films from scratch and filming with my friends. Creating is my outlet and is what truly makes me happy. When I'm not working on film projects, I'm likely hanging out with my rabbit, watching TV/movies with Michael (my boyfriend/co-writer/editor), or reading books to find more inspiration.


I need financial help to bring my vision to life. Movies aren't cheap, even short ones! You may (or may not) have noticed that the setting for this film is in a high-end home, restaurant kitchen and school, and we're shooting in Atlanta. We'll need to find the perfect locations and have top-notch production design to pull off the look we need and that will cost money. Having professional actors tell the story will cost money too.

<h3><strong>DIRECTOR STATEMENT:</strong></h3>
<p>I am a British independent filmmaker from Iranian origin, since 2013 I’ve written, directed and produced three short films that fit loosely under a genre of spiritual black comedy. Rebirth was the second of the third short films and brought several accreditations: premiering at the Alexandria Film Festival -USA  and also winning Best Comedy Short at the “Madrid International Film Festival “ in 2015.</p>

<p>Having memories and encounters from the eight years of war between Iran and Iraq, alongside persecution for my personal abandonment of religious belief; I’ve dedicated my first feature film project “Universe Zone” to anti-violence and the tolerance towards all faiths. “Universe Zone” stands to question racist views and proposes to tackle religious conflict through a mystical science fiction story, offering love as the ultimate answer to disbelief. With this in mind I feel determination to make my first feature film within confines of a self funded micro budget.</p>
<p>“Universe Zone” is taking inspiration from “Roadside Picnic” written by Boris &amp; Arkady Strugatsky. Universe Zone captures a dialogue between our capacity for emotion, spiritual belief and ongoing debate between religion and science, set within the context of a fractured yet diverse society. In 1979, the legendary Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky completed Stalker based on the novel of the same name. Although “Universe Zone” shares many similar elements and qualities to both Strugatsky’s Roadside Picnic and Tarkovsky’s Stalker, it has been written quite differently to incorporate my own personal experiences.</p>

<h3>Pledge for fund support:</h3>
<p>As this is a feature film my personal saving and loan can only cover %50 of the cost of production, Although I have made a budget list very realistically and practically based on a minimum compact crew , free and fully authorised locations, minimum casts and less expenses still the budget of the film would need another %50 fund by crowdfunding bakers. This is why for the first time I have came to this crowdfunding platform to pledge for your fund support. It is my ultimate mission and goal to make this film this year not next year , and I wish you support this project and all the team who will work on this project to make a beautiful and amazing feature film together. We would be very grateful.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

We also will have a full transparent accounting on this project by certificate legal accountant. The company that will produce the film is ESPRIT STUDIOS Ltd. based in London , registration number is: 09120872</li>
<li>I have amazing perks for bakers;  I can offer bakers free accommodation and even dinner in London and Kiev luxury apartments. See offered perks options and if you have any more questions or you like to change something in the perks option I would be glad to get your message.</li>
<li>I would do anything to make this film this year, even just by using all my own self fund resources without crowdfunding fund I will still make this film project but sadly the crew and casts would not get paid which I think it would be unfair and also it would effect the quality of the film due to select non professional in order to reduce the cost, but if I get sufficient fund here I would pay the crew and casts total of the fund , as much as I get , to the last penny, and I would have better options to choose and hire professionals with experience.

<h3><strong>What is the story?</strong></h3>
<p>    The basic story is a Job-like scenario, where a man discouraged with his current place in life has a poetic conversation with God. Through this short story, God explains and reassures the Man that he isn’t missing out on life. He’s just in the middle of a process.</p>
<h3>What is the main idea?</h3>
<p>    Nothing you do will have a Godly, lasting impact if your heart's not in the right place, so don’t despise the time it takes to grow and work out your heart.</p>
<h3>Why do you want to make this production?</h3>
<p>     The reason I want to make this production is because it's a reflection of my own journey these past few years. I dream about being a filmmaker in the film industry, and I was excited to move to Atlanta to pursue my career and make movies that would change the world. However, I found myself dealing with drastic life changes and not really having a clear direction on where to start. There were even people who wounded me when it came to my dreams to the point where I had to deal with discouragement and a newfound anxiety. I saw myself as stuck and not doing anything worthwhile with my life.</p>
<p>     God didn’t see it that way. He used this stop in my life to work on my heart. He didn’t just heal the new hurts, but old ones that I didn’t know I was carrying before I moved to Atlanta. Without this pause in my life, I would’ve gone into a rough industry that would’ve taken advantage of these insecurities and taken me away from God’s true, better purpose in my life. I want to share this lesson that I learned with others facing similar situations. It is still something I wrestle with today, but now I have a reassurance that where I am is where I need to be.</p>
<h3>How are you going to make this video its best/successful?</h3>
<p>    While other spoken word videos typically recite poetry to a captive audience, <i>The Spoken Word</i> acts a little more like a condensed narrative. Both characters are talking to each other throughout the film, not to the audience. The idea here is to give new life to the format, where usually the artists could be reciting the poetry on stage or on video with no differences.</p>
<p>    Another way we are adding life is by filming at 2 locations that have direct contrasts with each other. One is a diner at night, and the other is an abandoned location with greenery and light. The locations could vary based on costs and availability, but the dark, more familiar scenario and the light, more distant scenario will still be the goal for the final product. </p>
<p>    We also have an amazing group of people leading the way for the film! Here are the primary crew members guiding the film to success!</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618407480/sf1lsmbcylvr5ineiq1z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><u><strong>Chloe Lewis as the Producer, Director, &amp; Editor</strong></u></p>
<ul><li>Chloe is an excitable personality with a love of people and good stories. Ever since she was a kid, she has always loved creating new worlds to explore and build. Stories are the reason she actually chose to make her faith in Christ her own. In 2005, she attended a walk-through play called Eternity House that revealed her own heart to her about how she wasn’t genuine in her beliefs and how that affected others. While still in high school, Chloe decided that she wanted to take her stories to the movies rather than just write them into books. She attended Evangel University and graduated with a BFA in Film in 2014. By the time she had graduated, she had 6 feature length school films under her belt, as well as a few short films and camp videos from Forest Home. (Fun fact! Her work nickname at camp was Blooper.) She got married to her best friend in 2016 and moved to Atlanta to pursue a career in film. While pursuing film hasn't looked exactly like she wanted, God has been faithful to her.

<ul><li>Born in Savannah, GA, Tyree was raised in a single mother home and in the church. This soon sparked his interest in music. It wasn't until junior high that his faith in God matched the lyrics in his songs. This eventually led to Tyree being bullied and expelled from school due to the numerous altercations he'd get into because of how differently he lived. With half of his heart concerned with following Jesus and the other half concerned with fending off school threats, the young artist found himself in a war for his life, trying to find his identity. After battling with years of straddling the fence as a high school student, he heard Christian Hip Hop and the message it was spreading. Tyree was ready to go all in for Jesus. He decided to recommit his entire life to serving God while boldly sharing the gospel through his words and life. Tyree continues to use his music as a platform to spread the message of Jesus while activating others to do the same. He now lives in Atlanta, GA with his wife of 3 years. Together, they serve their community by leading evangelistic outreaches around the area. This life of courage and boldness is embodied in Tyree's music and he desires to help invigorate and restore the hearts of people through music as it did for him.</li></ul>

<h3>Why should I help fund this project?</h3>
<p>    Originally, my plan was to gather a few hundred dollars and film as low budget as possible. However, as my friends and I progressed through pre-production, it became apparent that the film would not look or be its best without proper funding. This film would need about $5,000.00 to have a quality production. What this includes is…</p>

<p>     This does not include payments for the crew, from producer to production assistant. We will be feeding our crew good meals and snacks for our days of filming because they are donating their time for this awesome project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>     By investing in this project, you’re investing in myself and our wonderful team who helped bring this idea to its feet. We hope that you would invest into our passion and help this production move forward.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">It’s not just about the purpose but the process.</h2>
</div><p> </p></div>","What is the story?
    The basic story is a Job-like scenario, where a man discouraged with his current place in life has a poetic conversation with God. Through this short story, God explains and reassures the Man that he isn’t missing out on life. He’s just in the middle of a process.
What is the main idea?
    Nothing you do will have a Godly, lasting impact if your heart's not in the right place, so don’t despise the time it takes to grow and work out your heart.
Why do you want to make this production?
     The reason I want to make this production is because it's a reflection of my own journey these past few years. I dream about being a filmmaker in the film industry, and I was excited to move to Atlanta to pursue my career and make movies that would change the world. However, I found myself dealing with drastic life changes and not really having a clear direction on where to start. There were even people who wounded me when it came to my dreams to the point where I had to deal with discouragement and a newfound anxiety. I saw myself as stuck and not doing anything worthwhile with my life.
     God didn’t see it that way. He used this stop in my life to work on my heart. He didn’t just heal the new hurts, but old ones that I didn’t know I was carrying before I moved to Atlanta. Without this pause in my life, I would’ve gone into a rough industry that would’ve taken advantage of these insecurities and taken me away from God’s true, better purpose in my life. I want to share this lesson that I learned with others facing similar situations. It is still something I wrestle with today, but now I have a reassurance that where I am is where I need to be.
How are you going to make this video its best/successful?
    While other spoken word videos typically recite poetry to a captive audience, The Spoken Word acts a little more like a condensed narrative. Both characters are talking to each other throughout the film, not to the audience. The idea here is to give new life to the format, where usually the artists could be reciting the poetry on stage or on video with no differences.
    Another way we are adding life is by filming at 2 locations that have direct contrasts with each other. One is a diner at night, and the other is an abandoned location with greenery and light. The locations could vary based on costs and availability, but the dark, more familiar scenario and the light, more distant scenario will still be the goal for the final product. 
    We also have an amazing group of people leading the way for the film! Here are the primary crew members guiding the film to success! 
Chloe Lewis as the Producer, Director, & Editor
Chloe is an excitable personality with a love of people and good stories. Ever since she was a kid, she has always loved creating new worlds to explore and build. Stories are the reason she actually chose to make her faith in Christ her own. In 2005, she attended a walk-through play called Eternity House that revealed her own heart to her about how she wasn’t genuine in her beliefs and how that affected others. While still in high school, Chloe decided that she wanted to take her stories to the movies rather than just write them into books. She attended Evangel University and graduated with a BFA in Film in 2014. By the time she had graduated, she had 6 feature length school films under her belt, as well as a few short films and camp videos from Forest Home. (Fun fact! Her work nickname at camp was Blooper.) She got married to her best friend in 2016 and moved to Atlanta to pursue a career in film. While pursuing film hasn't looked exactly like she wanted, God has been faithful to her.

<h3><strong>What's Talibé means?</strong></h3>
<p>A talibé is a boy, usually from Senegal, Burkina-Faso, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali or Mauritania, who studies the Quran at a Daara, a residential Quranic school. His education is guided by a teacher known as a marabout. In most cases talibés leave their parents to stay in the daara.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The story</strong></h3>
<p><i><strong>LE TALIBE </strong></i> is a feature film that explores the harrowing story of a  young boy forced into a system of abuse and exploitation in the name of religion. Based on true events, the film tells the story of Moussa, a twelve year-old child who is taken from his village and forced to attend a traditional, Islamic boarding school (Daara) with his best friend. After arriving at the school, he quickly realized the school is not what it seems. Every day he is forced into the streets to beg for the schoolmaster (marabout). When the boys do not return with their daily quota, they are threatened, beaten, abused and held captive by the headmasters. As tragedy strikes, Moussa tries to escape and return to his family in the village.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>A message from the Writer/Director </strong></h3>
<p>I was born in the Ivory Coast and raised in Burkina Faso. I moved to the US in 2008 to study cinema. In 2015, I graduated with a B.A. in film from Point Park University in  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>As an African, one of my missions is to bring awareness to international issues like the  exploitation Islamic students  face in West Africa.</p>
<p>There are more than 100,000 talibés in Senegal alone, living in slavery-like conditions, suffering from abuse, neglect and exploitation.</p>
<p> Following the death of nine children in a late-night fire at a Daara near the center of Dakar in 2013,  I was motivated to shed light on this tragic issue. I travelled to Senegal and met with some of the organizations fighting for change, With this film, my hope is to see that every child receives a formal education and that the governments take actions towards the Daaras that are exploiting the students. </p>

of our short film AUДITION, almost entirely funded from the community, and upon the great interest, expressed by a wide range of international audiences around the globe during post-screening Q&A sessions and interviews asking us to further develop the story, we are excited to share with you that a process has been initiated to expand it into a full-length feature film!Maria has finished the script for the feature, while still traveling the globe, presenting the short at festivals, open-to-public and private screenings, allowing her to build the story and its pace, reflecting upon the reactions of the viewers, festival programmers and fellow film-makers and it is ever more poignant, relevant and brave, somewhat disturbing in moments, yet funny with its self-ironic and light-hearted tone.And again we turn to you for help and support in making the first step for developing the story into a feature film!THE STORY:An immigrant actress in her early 40s embarks on a mission to restart her once promising career, after more than a decade long hiatus due to marriage, giving birth and raising little children.Balancing between the full-time demands of motherhood and the desire to remain true to her lifelong dedication to acting, braving the do’s, don’ts and –isms of the Hollywood film industry, in a sudden twist she is faced with the challenge of imparting good values to her young inquisitive son in a typical atmosphere brimming with ethically questionable stereotypes, exposing him and the audience to the mechanics of the film-making, revealing some of Hollywood's dirty little secrets.Without being nagging and self-righteous, rather in a satirical and comic way, the story aims at empowering underdogs to stay strong in their pursuit of happiness, regardless of the obstacles and hardship.HOW FAR ARE WE WITHIN THE PROCESS?After Maria was done editing and polishing the script, following an input from a large number of film professionals and screen writers, as well as generic film lovers for a balanced and diverse opinion, we presented it to potential members of the production team and we are thrilled to announce that established, highly regarded, as well as awarded film-makers and actors, including some key figures from AUДITION, expressed readiness and excitement to commit their talents and passion, joining the feature film bandwagon.Majority of them are women film-makers, which further motivates us to develop the project – not only because it is in unison with the zeitgeist and caries a noble cause, but it feels conceptually right a story of a determined female professional and a loving mom to be told by a team of female movie-makers.PURPOSE OF THE CAMPAIGNDuring a course of year-long consultations with some prominent Producers and Production companies worldwide, who saw a great potential in the story, as it is universal, has a hint of a #MeToo element and could attract some celebrity names, we were advised that an opportunity exists for the script to be developed into a larger budget production (exceeding $2,000,000), rather than stay within the margins of what is considered low and ultra-low budget segment, thus dooming it to become art-house project with very limited, often festivals-only exposure.Achieving such goal would require hiring a Development Executive (DE) for a period of at least 6 months to 1 year - between $20k and $40k cost, with the necessary experience and connections - both here in Hollywood, as well as overseas, due to possibilities of expanding the potential market for such story, focused on an immigrant artiste to which a large international audience could relate.The tasks of the DE would require them to meet with members of large Production Companies, both international and local, and pitch for the project. That agent should also know well and feel at home within the realm of Film Distribution, as a portion of the financing of the future production could be secured in advance from a potential Distributor – a so-called “Pre-Sale Financing”.We have an exact fit for such position, meeting all of the above requirements! Someone who loved AUДITION unconditionally, who is inspired by Maria’s talents and in overall is a champion of Women-In-Film movement and who have already committed quite a lot of his time on multiple occasions without any financial interest in doing it so far and would continue doing it in the same manner. However, actually paying someone to pitch for “Day Player” to large studios full-time, instead of whenever her/his busy schedule allows, would guarantee that the film could become a reality, while the story is still relevant and the characters in it are not already history book personas.WHY SHOULD THIS FILM BE MADE?To find answer on such question, we ask you to please complete the following simple questionnaire, do the math and see which category of potential viewers you fall into: “Does a 40 year old mother deserve to dream of a career success at such age?”No – 0 points; It depends – 1 point; Yes – 2 points.“Is being an artiste considered a profession?”No – 0 points; It depends – 1 point; Yes – 2 points. “Have you ever left your birth place to live somewhere else for more than a few years to obtain higher education or in pursue of better opportunities?”No – 0 points; It depends – 1 point; Yes – 2 points.Results:0 to 1 point – you are probably in your infancy, but you can still enjoy the animated sequences in “Day Player”, get some good laughs out of the whole film,  and dance on the soundtrack, if we manage to properly finance all those elements, critical for a true rendition of the script and overall a well-made film.2 to 5 points – you are most likely in adolescence and you will dig the spicy language in “Day Player”, you will relate to at least 2 main characters in it and will get educated about a number of professions associated with film-making, learn more on how stuff works in Hollywood and probably will develop a strategy on how to remain true to your passions, persistent in pursuing your dreams and how to avoid and protect yourselves from predators at your future workplace – all useful knowledge in your forthcoming choice of a lifetime career.6 points – This film is just for you and making it with the right budget, level of craftsmanship and scale will benefit you as well, as it raises awareness about problems similar to yours and searches for solutions, not only philosophically and metaphysically, but quite real and pragmatic.Please support us and become part of our family, raising our baby “Day Player” as a community!",9.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>And he also finds out that he needs to fix the rescue pod within one hour or he will drift away into space.</p>
<p>That is the first episode of a new short film series that we are going to make. A series about Jack that find his way to the exoplanet Uus Elu 451 where he think he will be the first person to ever set foot on that new world. But soon finds out that he isn't alone on the planet.</p>

<p>After making the first episode as a separate short film we realized that we had so much more to tell and that we enjoy making film. We wanted to tell the story of Jack and how he struggles with facts that, as a child, you shouldn't be handling. </p>
<p>Uus Elu is estonian and means New Life. Jack's expedition were on their way to explore Uus Elu for a possebility of new life. And he finds new life but also creatures that needs a new life them self.</p>
<p>Suddenly the story is more about what life is, how you overcome your own thoughts about life and how far you are willing to go to save some one else's life.</p>
<p>This series will have a total of 5 episodes that will be 14 minutes long each. We only have children and youths infront of the camera and our main audience will be children and youths aged 8-15.</p>
<p>The four coming episodes will take place on the planet of Uus Elu and will be shot on Gotland, Sweden, an island in the Baltic Sea known for its magical environment for film and photography.</p>
<p>And we need your help to bring this to life.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have already got 10'000:- SEK in support from our local film resource center Film on Gotland. And we are super happy about it.  But we need more.</p>
<p>We have estimated the budget to 35'000:- SEK and the budget is roughly divided like this:</p>
<p>8000:- will go to set building, to build an exterior of the rescue pod and the interiors of three different facilities.</p>
<p>5000:- will go to props of all different kinds. To buy both actual props and building material.</p>
<p>4000:- will go to costumes, mainly to buy cloth for making costumes but also overalls and other parts that we can't make on our own.</p>
<p>8000:- is for renting three lenses that we need. We are filming with Black Magic Ursa Mini cameras but the lenses we had during the first episodes aren't available this summer, so we need to rent them from an other company.</p>
<p>3000:- is our food budget. It might sound very little, but we believe in making food from instead of buying already made food. In that way we can keep down our costs and also keep the food healthy and nutritious.</p>
<p>2000:- is for gas and transportations.</p>
<p>2000:- is for SFX Make-up. We need to create an alien mask for one of our actors and need to buy materials for that.</p>
<p>3000:- is our misc. budget. Things that might be needed.</p>
<p>The money we have got from Film on Gotland will be most for set building, props and costumes, so we do need to raise money for the lenses and food.</p>
<p>We are asking companies in Sweden to support us, but due to Covid-19 and other reasons we find if difficult to get help from them.</p>
<p>So if you help us out we will be more than greatful. We will love you for the rest of our life.</p>

<h3>The Director's speech</h3>
<p>To make this project become real would me so much to all of us.</p>
<p>As a director and producer, I haven't been able to make my own film in almost a decade. My inspiration has been totally of and there have been high demands that has made me feel that I just don't want to be a part of the filmmaking world for a long time. People telling me that I have to make films in their way and not my way.</p>
<p>With Uus Elu I am finally living out a dream and that is to make a sci-fi with youths and children infront of the camera, with a story that is for the same age as the actors are. To tell a story about life, the future, the ability to stand on your own and make decisions that could change your life totally. It is a story about growing up fast, but still try to be a child. It is a story about finding a way of new life and still keeping your own.</p>
<p>I have such great talents both infront and behind the camera, that I am privileged to work with. My cinematographer is 15 years old and is a shooting star. My actors are between 10-16 years old and all of them are hand picked because of their acting skills. </p>
<p>We all love to make film and we all believe in this story. And we all want to share it with the rest of the world!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590754956/od08qznrcf3oi3jeicw2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is always a risk with crowdfunding and filmmaking. There is always a risk that when the film is done it will be hard to screen it and even get it sold. But we can't do more than trying.</p>
<p>Let us reassure you that EVERY penny counts! Even if we don't reach our target goal, every bit of funding will come to use. There are many holes to fill but we also know how to work with what we have. But the more budget we have the better production we can make.</p>
<p>And we want to make a production that will be so good that festivals and TV-channels want to have our films there. We know we can make it, with your help.</p>
<p>The main challenges we have is to find lenses for the cameras. We have the opportunity to borrow cameras from the directors work, but we don't have the same lenses as we had when we did the first film. And if we don't get those lenses we will find lenses that we can work with, so the production will be made no matter what.</p>
<p>The only thing that can set us back is if every one gets sick. But then we'll move the production forward in time and make is as soon as possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that it is a strange time in the world right now. We know that people have lost their jobs, family members, dreams etc. We know that social distancing most likely will become a part of our new life.</p>
<p>By that we also know that many might now have the possibility to help us financially, but you can help us by sharing this campaign all over the place. Just by sharing this campaign on facebook, twitter, blogs, vlogs, communities and so on you ARE helping us. </p>
<p>Use the Indiegogo sharing tools to spread the word around.</p>

<p>After HANNAH, 25, finds out that her only family—GRANDMA, 76—is dying from Parkinson’s Disease, she struggles to cope with the news as past trauma rears its head, and her own disposition to internalize her feelings stands in the way. We bear witness to Hannah’s emotional journey in all its complexity but also its simplicity, as it unfolds through the dark, still hours of the night into a bright, stirring dawn. We watch the reversal of roles between the two women, as the cared-for becomes the caregiver, in this <u>story about loss, the grieving process and the potency of the act of feeling.</u></p>
<p><u>I want to make this film in honor of my own grandmother who passed away in 2017 after a years-long battle with Parkinson’s Disease.</u> You see, I have no memory of my grandmother in which she is healthy and lucid—I only ever remember her suffering.  Her’s is one of two funerals I have ever been to; and during it, I didn’t know how to be. Through the character of Hannah, this film is me looking back and trying to answer the question I had back then, the question about <u>how to face death.</u></p>
<p>Hannah’s relationship with her grandma is the first of many <u>female relationships</u> I hope to explore, and her character is the first among a string of <u>three-dimensional female roles</u> I hope to write. <u>Hannah is lonely but independent, messed-up but brave, stubborn but introspective. She is contradictory. She is flawed. She is learning. She is me.</u></p>

<p>Not only am I a <u>student filmmaker</u>, but I’m also a citizen from a third-world country living in NYC on a student visa that legally forbids me to get a job. That being said, I’m not asking you to fund the entire production—as in most student films, the students have to invest in their own visions.</p>
<p>Student films are riddled with budgetary constraints anyway, but now, <u>even more expenses are required for productions to adapt to COVID-19. OUR GOAL IS TO RAISE $3500. Any funds that we are lucky enough to raise on here will be spent toward covering the extra costs that are conducive to the welfare of the cast and crew.</u> To wit:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><p><strong>SAFETY GEAR: </strong>In light of the present COVID-19 situation, a significant portion of the budget must be spent on bulk orders of masks, hand sanitizers, wipes, gloves, soaps, an infrared thermometer for daily temperature-checks etc. for <u>NINETEEN CAST AND CREW MEMBERS</u>, as well as the frequent disinfection of both the set and equipment over <u>multiple days of shooting.</u></p></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>TRANSPORTATION:</strong> NYC Transit is expensive, more so now due to COVID-19 because we have to ensure that none of the nineteen cast and crew members has to take the subway/bus to travel to and from set for the duration of the shoot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CREW SALARIES:</strong> As a student filmmaker, I have been lucky enough to have had friends work on my film in the past for free due to budgetary constraints. But now, with the soaring unemployment rates, I cannot fathom not paying the nineteen cast and crew members for the hard work that they will undoubtedly bring to the film, especially since my cast and crew will consist of both <u>students and professionals who are currently out of a job</u> (film shoots will most probably not be allowed to commence before September in NYC).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FOOD:</strong> Instead of a self-service buffet, it is safer to have <u>box meals.</u> Organizing a <u>box meal per person for every meal during a multiple-day shoot</u> is proving to be more expensive.<strong> </strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>LOCATION:</strong> Before, we needed a location that was appropriate to the story but now, <u>we need a location that is also large enough to accommodate the various departments in separate areas so that they are isolated from each other during the multiple-day shoot.</u><strong>                                                                                                                  </strong></p></li>

I now have 3 years of experience working as a filmmaker in the US. I have written, directed and produced three short films. I was the director on commercials for clients such as Apple India, Kohler Co., and Line Producer on music videos for clients such as Apple India, Viacom 18 India and T-series.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>LET'S SPREAD THE WORD AND BEGIN THIS EXCITING JOURNEY TOGETHER!</u></strong></h3>
</div></div>","After HANNAH, 25, finds out that her only family—GRANDMA, 76—is dying from Parkinson’s Disease, she struggles to cope with the news as past trauma rears its head, and her own disposition to internalize her feelings stands in the way. We bear witness to Hannah’s emotional journey in all its complexity but also its simplicity, as it unfolds through the dark, still hours of the night into a bright, stirring dawn. We watch the reversal of roles between the two women, as the cared-for becomes the caregiver, in this story about loss, the grieving process and the potency of the act of feeling.
I want to make this film in honor of my own grandmother who passed away in 2017 after a years-long battle with Parkinson’s Disease. You see, I have no memory of my grandmother in which she is healthy and lucid—I only ever remember her suffering.  Her’s is one of two funerals I have ever been to; and during it, I didn’t know how to be. Through the character of Hannah, this film is me looking back and trying to answer the question I had back then, the question about how to face death.
Hannah’s relationship with her grandma is the first of many female relationships I hope to explore, and her character is the first among a string of three-dimensional female roles I hope to write. Hannah is lonely but independent, messed-up but brave, stubborn but introspective. She is contradictory. She is flawed. She is learning. She is me.
 
MOVIE COMPARABLES
Lynne Ramsay's 'YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HERE' meets Terrence Malick's 'THE TREE OF LIFE.'


 
INFLUENCES
'Grandma' is heavily influenced by the transcendental style of filmmakers Yasujirō Ozu and Robert Bresson.
   
I have set up this fund with the full knowledge that AT PRESENT, THERE ARE MANY MORE IMPORTANT CAUSES THAT NEED MONETARY SUPPORT. In this context, I unequivocally state that a student thesis film is very low on the list of what matters most at this moment in time. I urge you, therefore, to DONATE TO GEORGE FLOYD'S MEMORIAL FUND, the various CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUNDS or any fund of your choice FIRST AND FOREMOST. 
THEREAFTER, if you choose to give—no matter how much—to this film because you know someone who suffers from Parkinson’s Disease or you’ve lost a grandparent or you can see yourself in Hannah, I’d like you to know that you’re getting a film made. And a film, to me, serves to extend an audience’s empathetic reach to include someone else’s experiences—a new narrative that you haven’t seen, that you haven’t FELT, before. I believe in my film enough to know that it advocates for empathy because it is a story that is deeply rooted in real, universal human experiences. 
We all know that film is a collaborative medium. No matter the scale of the film, it takes more than one person to bring it to fruition. I’ve lived my film. I know that many of you have, too. To me, this story is OUR STORY. I hope that you will feel the same way, too.
  

Not only am I a student filmmaker, but I’m also a citizen from a third-world country living in NYC on a student visa that legally forbids me to get a job. That being said, I’m not asking you to fund the entire production—as in most student films, the students have to invest in their own visions.
Student films are riddled with budgetary constraints anyway, but now, even more expenses are required for productions to adapt to COVID-19. OUR GOAL IS TO RAISE $3500. Any funds that we are lucky enough to raise on here will be spent toward covering the extra costs that are conducive to the welfare of the cast and crew. To wit:
 
SAFETY GEAR: In light of the present COVID-19 situation, a significant portion of the budget must be spent on bulk orders of masks, hand sanitizers, wipes, gloves, soaps, an infrared thermometer for daily temperature-checks etc. for NINETEEN CAST AND CREW MEMBERS, as well as the frequent disinfection of both the set and equipment over multiple days of shooting.

TRANSPORTATION: NYC Transit is expensive, more so now due to COVID-19 because we have to ensure that none of the nineteen cast and crew members has to take the subway/bus to travel to and from set for the duration of the shoot.
CREW SALARIES: As a student filmmaker, I have been lucky enough to have had friends work on my film in the past for free due to budgetary constraints. But now, with the soaring unemployment rates, I cannot fathom not paying the nineteen cast and crew members for the hard work that they will undoubtedly bring to the film, especially since my cast and crew will consist of both students and professionals who are currently out of a job (film shoots will most probably not be allowed to commence before September in NYC).
FOOD: Instead of a self-service buffet, it is safer to have box meals. Organizing a box meal per person for every meal during a multiple-day shoot is proving to be more expensive. 
LOCATION: Before, we needed a location that was appropriate to the story but now, we need a location that is also large enough to accommodate the various departments in separate areas so that they are isolated from each other during the multiple-day shoot.                                                                                                                  

WE PLEDGE THAT ALL LEFTOVER FUNDS WILL BE SPLIT AMONG:

GEORGE FLOYD'S MEMORIAL FUND
THE CORONAVIRUS EMERGENCY RELIEF FUND
THE MICHAEL J. FOX FOUNDATION FOR PARKINSON'S RESEARCH

 

For now, we aim to begin shooting in the first week of October, 2020.

<p align=""center""><u><strong>DOES LOVE DIE WITH TIME AND AGE?</strong></u></p>
<p>How many short films do you see based around an elderly Australian couple? Not many.</p>
<p>I – Ashlee Herpich, the writer/director - and a crew from JMC Academy Sydney are creating the short film <strong>AGED</strong> to tell the story of the acceptance of aging, and reconnecting with someone you once loved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>Graeme – who would rather stay in his room watching television in the dark – is dragged out into the world by his wife Miriam. The elderly couple re-live their first dates back when they were young. From a makeover, to sharing a milkshake in a diner café, and riding around a park. But Graeme is still defiant about being out. And tensions between the couple come bubbling over. But will they reconnect? Or have they lost sight of who each other really are once and for all?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Meaning of AGED</strong></p>
<p>As we grow older, we can drift apart from each other, but that doesn’t mean all is lost. In the final years of our lives, reconnection is an important thing, to bring back the relationship and love two people once shared.</p>
<p>AGED shows the differences in two people, and their ability to reconnect with each other, even after so long apart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why are we creating AGED?</strong></p>
<p>I have the desire to create a film that focuses on a demographic not commonly represented in short films. I want to tell their stories, and show a glimpse into the struggles of this elderly couple, not just as characters, but as people.</p>
<p>I aim to depict the differences in people, how age impacts us differently, and how relationships are changed over time.</p>
<p>I hope this film can be an eye-opener for all generations to the relationships and changes between older Australians.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>AGED is</strong> a sense of hopefulness, warmth, an upbeat adventure, reminiscence, and a heart-warming feeling that resonates throughout the film.</p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","DOES LOVE DIE WITH TIME AND AGE?
How many short films do you see based around an elderly Australian couple? Not many.
I – Ashlee Herpich, the writer/director - and a crew from JMC Academy Sydney are creating the short film AGED to tell the story of the acceptance of aging, and reconnecting with someone you once loved.
 
Story
Graeme – who would rather stay in his room watching television in the dark – is dragged out into the world by his wife Miriam. The elderly couple re-live their first dates back when they were young. From a makeover, to sharing a milkshake in a diner café, and riding around a park. But Graeme is still defiant about being out. And tensions between the couple come bubbling over. But will they reconnect? Or have they lost sight of who each other really are once and for all?
 
Meaning of AGED
As we grow older, we can drift apart from each other, but that doesn’t mean all is lost. In the final years of our lives, reconnection is an important thing, to bring back the relationship and love two people once shared.
AGED shows the differences in two people, and their ability to reconnect with each other, even after so long apart.
 
Why are we creating AGED?
I have the desire to create a film that focuses on a demographic not commonly represented in short films. I want to tell their stories, and show a glimpse into the struggles of this elderly couple, not just as characters, but as people.
I aim to depict the differences in people, how age impacts us differently, and how relationships are changed over time.
I hope this film can be an eye-opener for all generations to the relationships and changes between older Australians.
 
AGED is a sense of hopefulness, warmth, an upbeat adventure, reminiscence, and a heart-warming feeling that resonates throughout the film.
 
Vision
My vision is for a heart-warming, sweet film. With a colourful vibrant world, and a sound track of upbeat 1950’s hits. Despite the fun feeling of adventure with the characters, the emotional beats are strong, with a real sense of being in the moment with the characters, seeing the depth of their situation and of their truth.
 
Budget
According to 4 filming days

 
 
The majority of the budget will be dedicated to location approvals and payments.
The art department will take up $1000 of the total budget
The rest of the budget is dispersed between our logistical aspects of catering, transport, etc.
Contingency and Other are safety nets for the production for unexpected situations.
Surplus money will go to festivals, cast, and final payments.
Therefore, we will be aiming for a $4000 budget for the entire film.

<h3>The Film</h3>
<p>Homecoming is a story about a college freshman returning home for the first time, only to say goodbye to his past, one which he has a complicated love/hate relationship with.</p>
<p>The film's themes include the harmfulness of denial, the myth of true closure, and (most of all) suburban boredom!</p>
<p>We're drawing inspiration from other coming-of-age films like Mid90s, Pineapple Express, American Graffiti, and Superbad. We noticed that there were no coming of age films that tackled someone's first summer back home... and that's where the idea for HOMECOMING was born from!</p>

<h3>About TRASHY:</h3>
<p>My name is Heather Gustafson, and I'm not going to throw any trash away for 365 days. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I know it seems over-the-top, but already; people all over the world are doing their part to make as little trash as possible in their daily lives. It's called zero-waste and it's gained popularity over the past few years thanks to social media. In fact: you may have even seen some influencers online touting the trash they've produced over X amount of years, and how it can fit into a 16oz mason jar!</p>
<p>As I document my experience, I'm not going to try and fit my trash for a year into a glass jar. Instead, I'm using a much larger clear bin.</p>
<p>Let me tell you more about myself before we go any further...</p>
<h3>A little about me:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have nearly a decade of experience in broadcast journalism</li>
<li>I won an EMMY last December for my work in TV news</li>
<li>I love the environment, but also love make up, and online shopping!</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing this, I'm hoping it shows you that I have a knack for story telling; a personal interest in this topic; and just might be relatable to some of you out there who want to help the environment but don't want to go to extremes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What the money $$$ is for:</h3>
<p>Most of this budget is for travel and lodging for me and my three crew members. The TRASHY team doesn't need to travel in style, but even in a pandemic, air-travel is expensive! </p>
<p>Additional costs include: setting up the call-to-action website to continue the impact after the film is over. As well as film festival application costs.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We don't expect you to just give us money without something in return. (Although we won't turn it away if you do)! </p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of some of the perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Special Thanks! in the credits</li>
<li>A Reusable straw</li>
<li>A Glass mason jar</li>
<li>A TRASHY tshirt</li>
<li>A Film screening followed with a Q&amp;A</li>
<li>Associate and Executive Producer credits</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>After the film is over, we hope viewers take away a better understanding of what zero-waste is; as well as some daily tips they can use in their lives to help the planet. We also hope to set up a call-to-action on our website and have people take the TRASHY challenge of going zero-waste.</p>
<p>We feel this film is entertaining but also important for the world to see. We want to reach as many people as possible - you can help us do that! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The good news--We are already in-production and are halfway through filming!</p>

<h3>LETS POUR THE TEA THEN...</h3>
<p>From Jodie Davey Creates Lift Off Sessions finalist 2020 film 'VOID', we now want to introduce HALO HALO productions and our first, theatrically whimsical dark spoken word film, Pouring Tea.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/BZxujgRrEKI?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Jodie. I am a Filipino and British 26 year old Actor and Film maker from Suffolk UK - based in and climbing through a jungle of creative visions in South West London.</p>
<p>I founded JODIE DAVEY CREATES in 2018 and in 2021 I have resurrected the dream to bring my production company 'HALO HALO productions' to life.</p>
<p>HALO HALO productions means Mix Mix in Tagalog, the language of my heritage from The Philippines. HALO HALO production's name comes from the idea of a traditional Filipino desert that consists of a mixture of different elements, surprising and spontaneous ingredients, that make an unexpectedly delicious concoction.<br/>THIS is exactly what our productions will embody.</p>
<p>We value teaming up with other creatives from under represented background</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?</h3>
<p><strong><i>Pouring Tea </i></strong>is a spoken word piece written and directed by Jodie Davey. The film is based on a true story, true events and experiences.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""text-align: center;font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Must we have to reach breaking point in order to follow our dreams?</b></p>
<p>Our short film, Pouring Tea, explores the notion of experiencing grief, longing and hope in an oppressive and fast pace society where the societal norms, obligations and stereotypes remain stagnant.</p>
<p>We follow the story of 6 waitresses suppressing their mental breakdowns in order to keep themselves and their dreams alive.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>""Pouring Tea...that's me<br/>As I pour another drink, I think<br/>Of a desired future<br/>One that can link this and that<br/>Together<br/>Forever.""</i></strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Pouring Tea</strong></i>, once a memo on my iphone , now evolves into a short film 3 years later into a script that will soon be brought to life. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630581123/bttazojltlxdoqjqju0i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHY SHOULD WE CARE?</strong></h3>
<p>HALO HALO Productions celebrates and takes pride in employing creatives from underrepresented backgrounds, creating a safe space and environment for anyone working with us.</p>
<p>We strive to tell meaningful stories that tackle themes and issues that usually get overlooked by the norms in our media.</p>
<p>HALO HALO productions will always be open to new forms of story telling, new ideas, stories and innovative and sustainable film making.</p>
<p><i><strong>Why should we care about Pouring Tea?</strong></i></p>
<p>Ask yourself these questions.<br/>Have you ever felt pushed to the side at your job? <br/>Have your aspirations ever felt squashed by others who deem them unimportant?<br/>Have you ever felt targeted by the colour of your skin, the thickness of your accent, the identity that you treasure?<br/>Have you ever felt the need to pour the tea and shed your thoughts on this?<br/>That's why we're here.<br/><br/>Following on from my own personal experiences as a woman and sharing experiences with my friends and family from under represented backgrounds, Pouring Tea's narrative follows the stories of women who tackle racism and harassment, yet prevail through sheer resilience, fear and exhaustion with the help of their hope of dreaming.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">According to UNWOMENUK :<br/><strong><i>""71% of women of all ages in the UK have experienced some form of sexual harassment in a public space. This number rises to 86% among 18-24-year-olds and only 3% of 18-24 year-olds reported having not experienced any of the types of harassment listed.<br/><br/>The two main reasons women of all ages cited for not reporting incidents are: “I didn’t think the incident was serious enough to report” (55%) and “I didn’t think reporting it would help” (45%)</i></strong><br/><a href=""https://www.unwomenuk.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/APPG-UN-Women-Sexual-Harassment-Report_Updated.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">-https://www.unwomenuk.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/APPG-UN-Women-Sexual-Harassment-Report_Updated.pdf</a></p>
<p>I wanted to highlight this theme within Pouring Tea because issues such as racism, inequality, sexism and sexual harassment are met every single day by somebody and most cases go unreported or shrugged away. But what if we felt more compelled to be vocal about these issues? What will our world be like today?</p>
<p>It's time to re-ignite the conversation.</p>
<p>It's time to pour the tea.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHEN IS THE BIG DAY?</h3>
<p>IT'S A BIG PUSH!</p>
<p>We have found our perfect cafe location in Twickenham London, and we have a date.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>28TH SEPTEMBER 2021 - THE SHOOT DATE!</i></strong></p>
<p>The funding of this campaign means a lot to everyone in the process of making this film and everyone beyond who resonates with such themes and issues of Pouring Tea.</p>If you believe in GREAT storytelling and even GREATER production ethos - then I think you could make some dreams come true.<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE FUNDING - WHAT WE NEED</h3>
<p>Here's what we need!</p>
<p>As some of you might know, the funding process is all or nothing, So we really need your help in reaching our goal.<br/><br/>The funding will employ actors and crew, cover the costs of travel expenses, location, camera equipment and the post production process.</p>
<p>With anything raised over the goal, we hope to use this to contribute to film festivals such as BFI's shorts and donate to charities that support the vulnerable, women's protection and communities in need in the UK.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629246228/qaynfgwxlyqiicck7w8f.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The total cost of production we need to raise is <strong>£6000.00.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The funding will help cover the costs of:</strong></p>
<p>-<strong> LOCATION</strong> - Cafe in SW London + Theatre with access to lighting and rigging</p>
<p><strong>- CAST </strong>( 10 ACTORS IN TOTAL) - Voice over recording in studio and 2 x rehearsal sessions</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Cinematography is a crucial factor in the making of Pouring Tea. Developing the visual scope will be one of our biggest challenges as we begin to face the great job of sourcing the right equipment to truly bring our vision to life. We are planning to film a sequence with a rain machine of which will be used inside a theatre. This will mean we need to source the correct crew and equipment to operate this scene efficiently and safely.</p>
<p>We will be shooting our film within our uncertain COVID-19 era. Our challenge here is to ensure the health and safety of our crew and actors at all times therefore we will be undergoing daily check ins with every one and we will ensure lateral flow tests will be taken to make sure everyone feels as safe as possible. Social distancing will still be maintained where possible and all areas and equipment will be disinfected on set. </p>
<p>The BIGGEST challenge of all is to try and raise our set goal for our production. In order to do this we need to spread the word as much as possible to gain the support of our generous backers. We want to bridge this challenge and we want to ensure you that we couldn't do this without your help - you matter.<br/> </p>

From Jodie Davey Creates Lift Off Sessions finalist 2020 film 'VOID', we now want to introduce HALO HALO productions and our first, theatrically whimsical dark spoken word film, Pouring Tea.
 

 
WHO ARE WE?
Hi, I'm Jodie. I am a Filipino and British 26 year old Actor and Film maker from Suffolk UK - based in and climbing through a jungle of creative visions in South West London.
I founded JODIE DAVEY CREATES in 2018 and in 2021 I have resurrected the dream to bring my production company 'HALO HALO productions' to life.
HALO HALO productions means Mix Mix in Tagalog, the language of my heritage from The Philippines. HALO HALO production's name comes from the idea of a traditional Filipino desert that consists of a mixture of different elements, surprising and spontaneous ingredients, that make an unexpectedly delicious concoction.THIS is exactly what our productions will embody.
We value teaming up with other creatives from under represented background
 
 
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?
Pouring Tea is a spoken word piece written and directed by Jodie Davey. The film is based on a true story, true events and experiences.
Must we have to reach breaking point in order to follow our dreams?
Our short film, Pouring Tea, explores the notion of experiencing grief, longing and hope in an oppressive and fast pace society where the societal norms, obligations and stereotypes remain stagnant.
We follow the story of 6 waitresses suppressing their mental breakdowns in order to keep themselves and their dreams alive.
""Pouring Tea...that's meAs I pour another drink, I thinkOf a desired futureOne that can link this and thatTogetherForever.""
Pouring Tea, once a memo on my iphone , now evolves into a short film 3 years later into a script that will soon be brought to life. 
 

 
 
 
WHY SHOULD WE CARE?
HALO HALO Productions celebrates and takes pride in employing creatives from underrepresented backgrounds, creating a safe space and environment for anyone working with us.
We strive to tell meaningful stories that tackle themes and issues that usually get overlooked by the norms in our media.
HALO HALO productions will always be open to new forms of story telling, new ideas, stories and innovative and sustainable film making.
Why should we care about Pouring Tea?
Ask yourself these questions.Have you ever felt pushed to the side at your job? Have your aspirations ever felt squashed by others who deem them unimportant?Have you ever felt targeted by the colour of your skin, the thickness of your accent, the identity that you treasure?Have you ever felt the need to pour the tea and shed your thoughts on this?That's why we're here.Following on from my own personal experiences as a woman and sharing experiences with my friends and family from under represented backgrounds, Pouring Tea's narrative follows the stories of women who tackle racism and harassment, yet prevail through sheer resilience, fear and exhaustion with the help of their hope of dreaming.
According to UNWOMENUK :""71% of women of all ages in the UK have experienced some form of sexual harassment in a public space. This number rises to 86% among 18-24-year-olds and only 3% of 18-24 year-olds reported having not experienced any of the types of harassment listed.The two main reasons women of all ages cited for not reporting incidents are: “I didn’t think the incident was serious enough to report” (55%) and “I didn’t think reporting it would help” (45%)-https://www.unwomenuk.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/APPG-UN-Women-Sexual-Harassment-Report_Updated.pdf
I wanted to highlight this theme within Pouring Tea because issues such as racism, inequality, sexism and sexual harassment are met every single day by somebody and most cases go unreported or shrugged away. But what if we felt more compelled to be vocal about these issues? What will our world be like today?
It's time to re-ignite the conversation.
It's time to pour the tea.

Risks & Challenges
Cinematography is a crucial factor in the making of Pouring Tea. Developing the visual scope will be one of our biggest challenges as we begin to face the great job of sourcing the right equipment to truly bring our vision to life. We are planning to film a sequence with a rain machine of which will be used inside a theatre. This will mean we need to source the correct crew and equipment to operate this scene efficiently and safely.
We will be shooting our film within our uncertain COVID-19 era. Our challenge here is to ensure the health and safety of our crew and actors at all times therefore we will be undergoing daily check ins with every one and we will ensure lateral flow tests will be taken to make sure everyone feels as safe as possible. Social distancing will still be maintained where possible and all areas and equipment will be disinfected on set. 
The BIGGEST challenge of all is to try and raise our set goal for our production. In order to do this we need to spread the word as much as possible to gain the support of our generous backers. We want to bridge this challenge and we want to ensure you that we couldn't do this without your help - you matter.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Jason Karman (pronouns he/him) and I am an Asian LGBTQ writer-director-producer based in Vancouver.  When I grew up in Western Canada, I remembered the impact of trying to please others during my formative years; you end up losing yourself in the process.  I seek and engage in activities that are fulfilling and unexpected but struggled with how to present my sexuality to “save face.” As a result, I have written-directed 17 short films exploring themes of reconciliation, measuring ourselves to our role models, and male fragility.</p>
<p>Golden Delicious is the first feature-length movie that I am directing and it is a modern-day coming-of-age drama about an Asian Canadian teen caught between his father's expectations, his girlfriend's dreams and his newly awakened feelings for the boy next door.</p>
<p>The film empowers me to share and commiserate on experiences that are challenging to talk about openly. Golden Delicious offers teachable moments by showing us possibilities in leading and sometimes failing; the feature-length format gives me the necessary space to examine how we conduct ourselves and dares us to ask if we can do better. Feelings of shame have largely prevented diaspora communities of gay Asian men from finding themselves and each other desirable. Golden Delicious shows that if we embrace who we are, we would all be happier.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Shooting our first feature, and during a pandemic, was a pursuit in keeping everyone safe, staying efficient and taking an artistic risk. Our cast and crew worked tirelessly through all the health and safety protocols to bring this award-winning story to life. Securing locations required considerably more resources during a pandemic. Through the support of Telefilm Canada, BC Arts Council and Canada Council For The Arts, we wrapped principal photography in March 2021. I am extremely thankful nobody got sick during production. </p>
<p>To get us over the finish line, I need your help. With these protocols and our low independent budget, we experienced a shortfall and need to do pick-ups. The funds raised will also go towards post-production, specifically colour correction, sound mix and design, music composition and deliverables: assets that make the film accessible to a broader audience. I want to bring this film to schools and community screenings post-pandemic, engaging with students and educators. </p>
<p>We want to make a difference.  Please help us in making this film a success.  </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the 1990s, I worshipped the few role models in the media who were lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and questioning (LGBTQ+), as their experiences closely mirrored mine. However, there were no LGBTQ+ Asian role models in the media at the time, and it was not until later that I realized the importance of seeing myself represented on screen. In subsequent years, as a filmmaker, I discovered that by seeing yourself represented, you get to see what is possible; without that imagery, the search for role models becomes muddled and unclear, and the idealized versions of ourselves are never fully realized.</p>
<p>Despite it being 2021, there is still a social stigma attached to being queer, leading to less positive outcomes for young folks in our community. LGBTQ+ youth today still experience disproportionate rates of death by suicide, physical violence, intimidation, and bullying. Through this film, I want to give them hope that they are not alone, especially if they are visible minorities. The democratization of media today is breaking barriers, allowing Asian men to be taken seriously while questioning the notion of masculinity. Stories exploring themes of male fragility, measuring ourselves to others, and reconciliation resonate strongly with me: they reflect experiences endured in my upbringing. </p>

</div></div>","The Story
Hello, my name is Jason Karman (pronouns he/him) and I am an Asian LGBTQ writer-director-producer based in Vancouver.  When I grew up in Western Canada, I remembered the impact of trying to please others during my formative years; you end up losing yourself in the process.  I seek and engage in activities that are fulfilling and unexpected but struggled with how to present my sexuality to “save face.” As a result, I have written-directed 17 short films exploring themes of reconciliation, measuring ourselves to our role models, and male fragility.
Golden Delicious is the first feature-length movie that I am directing and it is a modern-day coming-of-age drama about an Asian Canadian teen caught between his father's expectations, his girlfriend's dreams and his newly awakened feelings for the boy next door.
The film empowers me to share and commiserate on experiences that are challenging to talk about openly. Golden Delicious offers teachable moments by showing us possibilities in leading and sometimes failing; the feature-length format gives me the necessary space to examine how we conduct ourselves and dares us to ask if we can do better. Feelings of shame have largely prevented diaspora communities of gay Asian men from finding themselves and each other desirable. Golden Delicious shows that if we embrace who we are, we would all be happier.
 

 
Team 
In 2013, I met a screenwriter Gorrman Lee. His story of being the family peacemaker while simultaneously carving out his own identity and a career in the arts resonated with me. We immediately connected and saw where our stories could intersect and merge. Subsequently, Gorrman worked as a story editor on my shorts, ""Up and Down"" and ""I Really Like You.""  
Golden Delicious is produced by Kristyn Stilling. Born and raised in British Columbia, Canada, Kristyn has immersed herself into the Canadian film community as an independent Producer who has produced over 17 short films and been nominated for a Leo 4 times. She is also the Programming Director For the Next Generation Indie Film Awards and the Chair of the Vancouver Short Film Festival. She has previously worked for such prestigious organizations as the National Film Board of Canada, Whistler Film Festival, Crazy8s Film Society, eOne, and the CMPA.
Our outstanding team is comprised of (but not limited to and in no particular order): Cinematographer Alfonso Chin, Production Manager Eli Morris, 1st AD Matthew Herst, Production Coordinator Jamie Lam, Locations Sound Recordist Coby DeGroot and Alex Shamku. Boom Operators Ivette Novales and Mauricio da Rocha Zani. Script Supervisor Corinne Taliunas, Production Designer Jordan Bent, Art Director Stafford Matthews,  Locations Manager David Pfrimmer, Steadicam Operators Chris Chow, Jay Kamal and Kenneth Lau, Key Hair/Make-Up Iveta Duong, Hair/Make-Up Assist Kana Okada, Stunt Choreographers Ashlea Earl and Jovan Nenadic, Intimacy Coordinators Megan Gilron and Phay Moores, 1st AC Parker Chen, 2nd AC Jacob Bombala, Sabrina Dang and Melissa Brewster, DIT/Assistant Editor So Young Park, Gaffer Laurel Brown, Key Grip Duke Nolan, Rob Shaw, Belen Garcia, and Declan Adams, Swing Grip Eloane Venkatapen, Diego Navarro, and Lucas Rojen. Dolly Grip Connel McLeod and Joe Lidderdale, Props Master Juan Gonzalez, Set Decorator Hayley MacPhail and Bonnie Smith. On Set Props Melissa Masse, Costume Designer Karyna Barros, Costume Assistants Robin Metcalfe and Danna Roycroft, Crafty Sherayn Dibley, Key PA Emily DeGusti, and COVID Safety Officer Henriette Viljoen.
Our exceptional cast is comprised of Cardi Wong, Chris Carson, Parmiss Sehat, Ryan Mah, Leeah Wong, Claudia Kai, Jesse Hyde, Zavien Garrett, Hunter Dillon, Jeffrey Joseph and Kameron Louangxay. Main Casting by Errin Lally and Annalese Tilling. Background Casting by Laurie Pavon Solis. 
Our pitch video is made possible by our Picture Editor Mike Jackson. Original Music is by Mary Ancheta, and BTS Videographer is by Jason Pope. BTS Stills is by Syd Wong.


 
What We Need & What You Get
Shooting our first feature, and during a pandemic, was a pursuit in keeping everyone safe, staying efficient and taking an artistic risk. Our cast and crew worked tirelessly through all the health and safety protocols to bring this award-winning story to life. Securing locations required considerably more resources during a pandemic. Through the support of Telefilm Canada, BC Arts Council and Canada Council For The Arts, we wrapped principal photography in March 2021. I am extremely thankful nobody got sick during production. 
To get us over the finish line, I need your help. With these protocols and our low independent budget, we experienced a shortfall and need to do pick-ups. The funds raised will also go towards post-production, specifically colour correction, sound mix and design, music composition and deliverables: assets that make the film accessible to a broader audience. I want to bring this film to schools and community screenings post-pandemic, engaging with students and educators. 
We want to make a difference.  Please help us in making this film a success.

The Impact
In the 1990s, I worshipped the few role models in the media who were lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and questioning (LGBTQ+), as their experiences closely mirrored mine. However, there were no LGBTQ+ Asian role models in the media at the time, and it was not until later that I realized the importance of seeing myself represented on screen. In subsequent years, as a filmmaker, I discovered that by seeing yourself represented, you get to see what is possible; without that imagery, the search for role models becomes muddled and unclear, and the idealized versions of ourselves are never fully realized.
Despite it being 2021, there is still a social stigma attached to being queer, leading to less positive outcomes for young folks in our community. LGBTQ+ youth today still experience disproportionate rates of death by suicide, physical violence, intimidation, and bullying. Through this film, I want to give them hope that they are not alone, especially if they are visible minorities. The democratization of media today is breaking barriers, allowing Asian men to be taken seriously while questioning the notion of masculinity. Stories exploring themes of male fragility, measuring ourselves to others, and reconciliation resonate strongly with me: they reflect experiences endured in my upbringing.

<h4>Can I support this project without having an Indiegogo account?</h4>
<p>Yes, you can give directly using a check, credit card, PayPal, etc. and you can choose any of the perks listed here or a custom reward for your support. Call 253-874-8400 or <a href=""http://facebook.com/ChristopherRedner"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact Christopher Redner</a> for details. </p>
<h4>What other kinds of perks/rewards are available?</h4>
<p>We're happy to work with you to design a reward package you'll love. Things like concerts, handwritten lyrics, special videos and album release parties in your town are just some of the options. Call 253-874-8400 or <a href=""http://facebook.com/ChristopherRedner"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact Christopher Redner</a> for details. </p>
<h4>When do you send perks like CDs, downloads, etc.?</h4>
<p>We send downloads by email, typically within 5-8 days. CDs typically ship the week after you receive your download by email. Custom perks may take longer, depending on what perks we're providing.</p>
<p>Fulfilling perks isn't an automated process - it is completely personally one perk at a time. After Indiegogo processes your donation they send an email confirmation to Christopher Redner. He'll sends all download perks contacts anyone who selects a  custom perk to find out what they want. If your perk includes a CD, he'll notify Bryan Duncan so he can autograph it for you and then mail it.</p>
<h4>Doesn't it take more funds than the goal to do a video?</h4>
<p>It does. But not all the funds are needed at once because not all the work happens at the same time. The amount raised mainly affects how many videos we can produce and how quickly.</p>
<h4>Can I participate even if I don't live in the United States?</h4>
<p>Not directly through Indiegogo. Unfortunately, the fees for international transactions through Indiegogo are now way too high. If you live outside the United States, please <a href=""http://BryanDuncan.com/contact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact Christopher Redner</a> for other options. </p>
<p>There are some extra shipping costs, compared to mailing the same items to an address in the United States, if you choose a perk that is rewarded by mailing you something. However, if you get multiple CDs together you'll save on the CDs and the shipping.</p>
<h4>Can I give an album or other perks to my friends?</h4>
<p>You betcha! Indiegogo allows you specify who you want the perk sent to and indicate that it is a gift. You can even include a note for the recipient of your gift.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499792644/nco7i7wuy6wfcziqialk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

Bryan needs videos to build support for new recordings and to promote the albums so people get to hear and enjoy them. 
Video makes other content more effective. Social media, special reports, and ministry updates are all more effective when they use videos.


 
We've successfully produced three albums using crowdfunding campaigns like this. You can get those albums here --->.We have the passion and ability to make more great videos but not the budget. For everyone who already knows they want to help Bryan, here's how you can get involved. We've got lots of rewards-- something for everyone.

FAQ
Can I support this project without having an Indiegogo account?
Yes, you can give directly using a check, credit card, PayPal, etc. and you can choose any of the perks listed here or a custom reward for your support. Call 253-874-8400 or contact Christopher Redner for details. 
What other kinds of perks/rewards are available?
We're happy to work with you to design a reward package you'll love. Things like concerts, handwritten lyrics, special videos and album release parties in your town are just some of the options. Call 253-874-8400 or contact Christopher Redner for details. 
When do you send perks like CDs, downloads, etc.?
We send downloads by email, typically within 5-8 days. CDs typically ship the week after you receive your download by email. Custom perks may take longer, depending on what perks we're providing.
Fulfilling perks isn't an automated process - it is completely personally one perk at a time. After Indiegogo processes your donation they send an email confirmation to Christopher Redner. He'll sends all download perks contacts anyone who selects a  custom perk to find out what they want. If your perk includes a CD, he'll notify Bryan Duncan so he can autograph it for you and then mail it.
Doesn't it take more funds than the goal to do a video?
It does. But not all the funds are needed at once because not all the work happens at the same time. The amount raised mainly affects how many videos we can produce and how quickly.
Can I participate even if I don't live in the United States?
Not directly through Indiegogo. Unfortunately, the fees for international transactions through Indiegogo are now way too high. If you live outside the United States, please contact Christopher Redner for other options. 
There are some extra shipping costs, compared to mailing the same items to an address in the United States, if you choose a perk that is rewarded by mailing you something. However, if you get multiple CDs together you'll save on the CDs and the shipping.
Can I give an album or other perks to my friends?
You betcha! Indiegogo allows you specify who you want the perk sent to and indicate that it is a gift. You can even include a note for the recipient of your gift.

How can I get more information about Bryan Duncan, his music, etc.?
If you back this project you'll receive his Soul Furnace Reports and an invitation to a private forum. Both contain lots of behind-the-scenes stories, information, and the opportunity to connect with Bryan Duncan directly. People who are interested in Bryan but not ready to back this project are invited to get his newsletter here.
What if I have a question that isn't answered here or want a perk that isn't offered?
Send me a message using the contact link or send a message on Facebook.

<p><strong>THANK YOU for helping us reach our stretch goal!!  With 30 days to go, we're launching our second stretch goal of £1200!  The extra £200 will cover our initial festival submission fees for when the film is complete and ready to be screened.</strong></p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p><strong>Thanks to our backers we have hit our target!  We are blown away by the support you have shown 'Authentic'!  With 56 days left, we are now opening an ambitious Stretch Goal of £1000 to help with the following:</strong></p>
<p>- Hire extra lenses and equipment to make the visuals as beautiful as they can be.</p>
<p>- Book our first choice location for the interior scenes.</p>
<p>- Cover Indiegogo fees so we can put a larger amount of funds towards the film.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Trailer:</h3>
<p>Our trailer embodies what the film is about - truth, realness and authenticity - it’s honest and a little rough around the edges as we’ve made use of self-tapes as opposed to professionally filmed tapes to eliminate any unnecessary filming during COVID. But it’s got heart and Authenticity and we hope you enjoy our concept before you see the real deal.</p>
<h3>Cast and Crew</h3>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're hoping to raise £500 towards production costs in order to pay travel expenses, feed the talented cast and crew and fund entry into festivals when the film is complete.</li>
<li>In return for your generous donations, we're offering some great perks, including the chance to have your name in the credits and the opportunity to check out the finished film before anyone else!</li>
<li>As the majority of 'Authentic' is self funded, it will still be made if we don't reach our goal.  Any funds raised here will be used to promote the film through festivals, creating opportunities and exposure for the team.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>We believe that nobody should feel they have to hide who they are.  If this film helps to give even one person the confidence to embrace their authentic self, we will have succeeded in producing something very special.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Covid-19 is still a threat in 2021,  All cast and crew have completed up-to-date Screenskills Coronavirus training and are aware of the protocols required to keep everyone safe while filming.  There is a chance that further restrictions and lockdowns may impact filming.  No filming will take place until we are legally allowed to do so and in order to comply with legislation we have made the decision to shoot in Nicola's local area using outdoor locations where reasonably possible.  Full risk assessments will be undertaken by our producer for each location and all cast and crew will be provided with free hand sanitiser and all meals and snacks will be individually wrapped.  </li>
<li>Outdoor shoots involve many challenges in terms of logistics.  As we plan to shoot in February there is the chance that the shoot will be affected by inclement weather.  To prepare for this, we will encourage all cast and crew to dress appropriately and we will provide blankets and hot drinks while outdoors.</li>
</ul>

What We Need & What You Get

We're hoping to raise £500 towards production costs in order to pay travel expenses, feed the talented cast and crew and fund entry into festivals when the film is complete.
In return for your generous donations, we're offering some great perks, including the chance to have your name in the credits and the opportunity to check out the finished film before anyone else!
As the majority of 'Authentic' is self funded, it will still be made if we don't reach our goal.  Any funds raised here will be used to promote the film through festivals, creating opportunities and exposure for the team.


The Impact
We believe that nobody should feel they have to hide who they are.  If this film helps to give even one person the confidence to embrace their authentic self, we will have succeeded in producing something very special.

Risks & Challenges

Covid-19 is still a threat in 2021,  All cast and crew have completed up-to-date Screenskills Coronavirus training and are aware of the protocols required to keep everyone safe while filming.  There is a chance that further restrictions and lockdowns may impact filming.  No filming will take place until we are legally allowed to do so and in order to comply with legislation we have made the decision to shoot in Nicola's local area using outdoor locations where reasonably possible.  Full risk assessments will be undertaken by our producer for each location and all cast and crew will be provided with free hand sanitiser and all meals and snacks will be individually wrapped.  
Outdoor shoots involve many challenges in terms of logistics.  As we plan to shoot in February there is the chance that the shoot will be affected by inclement weather.  To prepare for this, we will encourage all cast and crew to dress appropriately and we will provide blankets and hot drinks while outdoors.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The first time I was gaslit by a doctor was in 2018. I’m a petite 20-something that at first glance, you’d assume is generally healthy. I went to the emergency room for chest pains and told him about my history with hypertension. After listing my symptoms and raising the concerns I researched, he condescendingly reassured me that “It’s nothing.” I followed up with my PCP doctor, and after several series of tests she sent me off to an Oncologist. Again, I had to defend my symptoms with the oncologist and was tossed around by multiple doctors. Now panicked, I kept replaying the patronizing conversations in my head. Frustrated with the cycle of reiterating my symptoms, being disregarded by medical professionals, and stressed from the numerous bills and inconclusive results; I gave up. Thankfully, after four specialists -  I found a doctor who treated my disease. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">For many women, it is far too common to have our symptoms downplayed. For Black women, we are assumed to have hysteria and exaggerate our pain.

As the Coronavirus pandemic sieges the nation, Black communities bear the brunt of the infections due to existing healthcare disparities. It's a legacy of structural discrimination that has limited access to healthcare for Black people, and further increases mistrust between the Black community and the medical industry.

<p>Nybie and Darren are a Black millennial couple and new parents. They're residents of Southern California but transplants from the South. ""Maternity"" will be visually fractured, similar to the current state of Nybie's anatomy. As the story progresses, Nybie's body becomes not her own. She is a broken and restructured mass similar to that of a paper collage, filled with pieces that don't quite fit; however, they somehow make a whole. Her ""whole"" is her home and daughter Zora. Much of the film will be captured through her husband's lens, who in the story is an editorial photographer. His black and white photography will be juxtaposed with the dark elements in Nybie's birthing sequence.<br/>The intensity of complications in pregnancy will come alive through deep color and heavy contrast. The piece explores intimacy devoid of touch to create visual tensions on the screen. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606432201/kpqq4fjuuqelzqpkyq2e.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Our film ""Maternity"" aims to tackle the difficult discussion around maternal mortality in America. Implicit bias in healthcare is not a new phenomenon; Black bodies have endured medical inequalities since the founding of this nation. We hope to initiate a dialogue around preventable maternal deaths and highlight the inhumanity many Black mothers experience at hospitals. Black mothers are dying. In hospitals across America, Black women are three to four times more likely to die during childbirth and postpartum. Throughout the American healthcare System, Black women have a high mortality rate despite socio-economic status and education. Racial disparities are a leading cause of mistreatment, incorrect diagnosis, and access to quality reproductive care. It is estimated that 60 percent of maternal complications are preventable, yet America ranks 55th for maternal mortality. The United States has the worst maternal death rates in the developed world— 700 - 900 avoidable deaths occur every year.</p>

<h3><b>The Short of It:</b></h3>
<p><b><i>Memoir </i></b>is a short drama that takes place in the 90s and it's a film about a socially inept man with an abusive past who is forced to face his inner demons when he befriends a boy with a similar traumatic childhood. Scroll down to the ""<i>Reminiscing in Memoir</i>"" section below to learn more about the details of the film.<br/></p>
<h3>Why I need your help:</h3>
<p>My name is An Drew Lim and I'm in my final year of my film production program at Loyola Marymount University. This project is my first of two thesis films and it represents the final lap in my long journey striving to be a young filmmaker and marks the onset of a new chapter in my life.</p>
<p>My thesis film, <i>Memoir</i> is the ideal medium to express my creativity and my form of storytelling. Every moment in life is a memory, and we are the product of our memories; be it good or bad memories. This film explores themes regarding the past and how it transcends an individual's present to shape their understanding about the future.</p>
<p>YOU ARE IMPORTANT because all big things have small beginnings. To those who are unfamiliar with the process of filmmaking, it requires a lot of hard work, creativity, and financial resources to help bring a vision to life. Hence, your contribution, no matter if it is small or big, goes a long way.</p>
<h3>Reminiscing in <i>Memoir</i><br/>
</h3>
<p>They say that characters make the story. <br/></p>
<p><b>MICHAEL KING</b> - A socially inept person with trust issues who has decided to close himself from the outside world as a result of an abusive past in the hands of his alcoholic father. He grows up and works as a used electronic salesperson and one day, reluctantly befriends his landlord's son, Benjamin over a music session. They form a friendship but Michael is soon caught at a crossroads when he discovers that Benjamin suffers from a similar traumatic childhood. Placed in a familiar setting once again, Michael has to decide whether to face his inner demons or to walk away.</p>
<p><b>BENJAMIN</b> - A shy and timid boy full of curiosity that is rendered a victim of physical abuse as a result of a physical disability since birth; by being born with a cleft lip. He is fond of his neighbor, Michael and secretly wants to be friends with him even though Michael feels the opposite. Benjamin finds music as a form of solitude and peace from his abusive life through a used cassette player which belongs to Michael. Benjamin must soon decide between living an abused life with a blood relative or risk having a better future with a stranger.</p>
<p><b>TONY</b> - An alcoholic divorcee who spends his time getting drunk with his rent collection and letting out his frustrations on his only son, Benjamin as a form of stress relief. He views Benjamin as an exact reflection of his failure in life and marriage. Benjamin's physical disability adds salt to his wounds as his only product in life is nothing more than a burden.</p>
<p><b>WILLIAM KING</b> - An exact resemblance of Tony. As an average working class citizen, William turns to alcohol as a solution after discovering that his wife cheated on him. Young Michael King becomes physically abused as result of William's frustration and pain. </p>
<p><b>YOUNG MICHAEL KING</b> - An innocent soul who happens to be the victim of a physical abuse because his mere presence is a reflection of somebody else's failure. As a result, he is forced to live the rest of his life with a traumatic childhood.<br/></p>

</div></div>","The Short of It:
Memoir is a short drama that takes place in the 90s and it's a film about a socially inept man with an abusive past who is forced to face his inner demons when he befriends a boy with a similar traumatic childhood. Scroll down to the ""Reminiscing in Memoir"" section below to learn more about the details of the film.
Why I need your help:
My name is An Drew Lim and I'm in my final year of my film production program at Loyola Marymount University. This project is my first of two thesis films and it represents the final lap in my long journey striving to be a young filmmaker and marks the onset of a new chapter in my life.
My thesis film, Memoir is the ideal medium to express my creativity and my form of storytelling. Every moment in life is a memory, and we are the product of our memories; be it good or bad memories. This film explores themes regarding the past and how it transcends an individual's present to shape their understanding about the future.
YOU ARE IMPORTANT because all big things have small beginnings. To those who are unfamiliar with the process of filmmaking, it requires a lot of hard work, creativity, and financial resources to help bring a vision to life. Hence, your contribution, no matter if it is small or big, goes a long way.
Reminiscing in Memoir

They say that characters make the story. 
MICHAEL KING - A socially inept person with trust issues who has decided to close himself from the outside world as a result of an abusive past in the hands of his alcoholic father. He grows up and works as a used electronic salesperson and one day, reluctantly befriends his landlord's son, Benjamin over a music session. They form a friendship but Michael is soon caught at a crossroads when he discovers that Benjamin suffers from a similar traumatic childhood. Placed in a familiar setting once again, Michael has to decide whether to face his inner demons or to walk away.
BENJAMIN - A shy and timid boy full of curiosity that is rendered a victim of physical abuse as a result of a physical disability since birth; by being born with a cleft lip. He is fond of his neighbor, Michael and secretly wants to be friends with him even though Michael feels the opposite. Benjamin finds music as a form of solitude and peace from his abusive life through a used cassette player which belongs to Michael. Benjamin must soon decide between living an abused life with a blood relative or risk having a better future with a stranger.
TONY - An alcoholic divorcee who spends his time getting drunk with his rent collection and letting out his frustrations on his only son, Benjamin as a form of stress relief. He views Benjamin as an exact reflection of his failure in life and marriage. Benjamin's physical disability adds salt to his wounds as his only product in life is nothing more than a burden.
WILLIAM KING - An exact resemblance of Tony. As an average working class citizen, William turns to alcohol as a solution after discovering that his wife cheated on him. Young Michael King becomes physically abused as result of William's frustration and pain. 
YOUNG MICHAEL KING - An innocent soul who happens to be the victim of a physical abuse because his mere presence is a reflection of somebody else's failure. As a result, he is forced to live the rest of his life with a traumatic childhood.

</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p>Hello!
First of all, thank you for checking out our campaign! We are very excited
about getting our project off the ground and we are grateful for your support!
The above clip is just a sneak peek of what we hope will become a short
documentary film about the amazing work being done at the non-profit
organization, the Sachamama Center for Biocultural Regeneration (SCBR), located in the
town of Lamas in the High Amazon region of Peru. You already met our founder
and director in the video, anthropologist Frederique Apffel-Marglin. Following
 the vision and leadership of Frederique, and featuring the artistic 
talents of independent filmmaker Doug LeConte, our goal is to create a 
film, both in English and Spanish, for educational purposes 
in Peru and the rest of Latin America as well as for the US and Canada. 
The knowledge this documentary details holds the promise of food sovereignty for indigenous and other small farmers throughout Latin America and, by offering an
 affordable and simple alternative to slash and burn agriculture, can bring 
about reforestation. Simultaneously, this knowledge holds the promise of 
powerfully mitigating the climate crisis anywhere in the world.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431279792/fjdwhmb7h9kw6xzbvigl.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 588px; height: 441px;""/></p><p><i>The Chacra-Huerto at the Sachamama Center for Biocultural Regeneration, the once degraded sandy soil was recovered after we applied Amazonian Dark Earth!</i><br/></p>Albert
Einstein said that no problem can be solved from the same level of
consciousness that created it. In order to find meaningful solutions to the
climate crisis and achieve a true sense of sustainability, we have to
reconsider our current worldview and how and why it has led us down a road of destruction
and disconnection. While recycling, composting, investing in renewable energy
sources and fuel efficient cars, and fossil fuel divestment are all steps in
the right direction, meaningful change and the healing of the earth cannot
occur unless we shift our paradigm to include the co-existence and co-creation
with nature and all her beings. <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431279690/z0qtkchlmvkwsy1aua7j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p></p><i>Pile of Amazonian Dark Earth made by the  local Sachamama team</i><b><br/><br/>The Impact</b>
<p>The
soil we are recreating at Sachamama, known as Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE) or terra
preta do indio (black earth of the Indians), is more than a mere technological
fix and represents a worldview of co-creation, reciprocity, and regeneration. We are the first to attempt its recreation in Peru and so far we have seen great results which we want to show through the film! It is providing a local alternative to slash and burn agriculture which can slow
deforestation and improve local agriculture while helping to reverse the
climate crisis. This miraculous ancient technology, with its biochar component,
sequesters CO2 from the atmosphere, is a permanent form of agriculture, recovers degraded lands, and
produces yields up to 800% higher than existing soils! It is also adaptable and
transferable to the other places both in Latin America and the US and Canada. <br/></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431281056/k4sc5i5oikyoqcspceqj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Students walking through a chacra (food field) in the indigenous community of Solo</i><br/></p>The
potential of the soil and the far-reaching effects it can have for those of us
living in the North are huge. We live in a society where, not just the earth,
but the people are suffering as well. The
evidence of this is all around us. People are physically, mentally,
emotionally, and spiritually sick. We suffer from a deep disconnection with the
earth and each other and this has led to some very sad and tragic consequences.
The story of the soil can bring us hope. Our goal in making this film is to
spread the word about this amazing soil and the profound stories that it holds.
By supporting our campaign you will help make this dream possible. More
importantly, you will be contributing to the desperately needed healing of not
only the Earth, but ourselves as well!<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431281662/n77f9h8j6xnr6g1r1eqh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Kids from the indigenous community of Shukshuyaku playing in the chacra-huerto</i><br/></p><b>What

be done in Peru, and because unfortunately we are not full time filmmakers, the
window of time in which we can travel to Peru to film is very limited. Travel

<br/></div>","IntroductionHello!
First of all, thank you for checking out our campaign! We are very excited
about getting our project off the ground and we are grateful for your support!
The above clip is just a sneak peek of what we hope will become a short
documentary film about the amazing work being done at the non-profit
organization, the Sachamama Center for Biocultural Regeneration (SCBR), located in the
town of Lamas in the High Amazon region of Peru. You already met our founder
and director in the video, anthropologist Frederique Apffel-Marglin. Following
 the vision and leadership of Frederique, and featuring the artistic 
talents of independent filmmaker Doug LeConte, our goal is to create a 
film, both in English and Spanish, for educational purposes 
in Peru and the rest of Latin America as well as for the US and Canada. 
The knowledge this documentary details holds the promise of food sovereignty for indigenous and other small farmers throughout Latin America and, by offering an
 affordable and simple alternative to slash and burn agriculture, can bring 
about reforestation. Simultaneously, this knowledge holds the promise of 
powerfully mitigating the climate crisis anywhere in the world.The Chacra-Huerto at the Sachamama Center for Biocultural Regeneration, the once degraded sandy soil was recovered after we applied Amazonian Dark Earth!Albert
Einstein said that no problem can be solved from the same level of
consciousness that created it. In order to find meaningful solutions to the
climate crisis and achieve a true sense of sustainability, we have to
reconsider our current worldview and how and why it has led us down a road of destruction
and disconnection. While recycling, composting, investing in renewable energy
sources and fuel efficient cars, and fossil fuel divestment are all steps in
the right direction, meaningful change and the healing of the earth cannot
occur unless we shift our paradigm to include the co-existence and co-creation
with nature and all her beings. Pile of Amazonian Dark Earth made by the  local Sachamama teamThe Impact
The
soil we are recreating at Sachamama, known as Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE) or terra
preta do indio (black earth of the Indians), is more than a mere technological
fix and represents a worldview of co-creation, reciprocity, and regeneration. We are the first to attempt its recreation in Peru and so far we have seen great results which we want to show through the film! It is providing a local alternative to slash and burn agriculture which can slow
deforestation and improve local agriculture while helping to reverse the
climate crisis. This miraculous ancient technology, with its biochar component,
sequesters CO2 from the atmosphere, is a permanent form of agriculture, recovers degraded lands, and
produces yields up to 800% higher than existing soils! It is also adaptable and
transferable to the other places both in Latin America and the US and Canada. Students walking through a chacra (food field) in the indigenous community of SoloThe
potential of the soil and the far-reaching effects it can have for those of us
living in the North are huge. We live in a society where, not just the earth,
but the people are suffering as well. The
evidence of this is all around us. People are physically, mentally,
emotionally, and spiritually sick. We suffer from a deep disconnection with the
earth and each other and this has led to some very sad and tragic consequences.
The story of the soil can bring us hope. Our goal in making this film is to
spread the word about this amazing soil and the profound stories that it holds.
By supporting our campaign you will help make this dream possible. More
importantly, you will be contributing to the desperately needed healing of not
only the Earth, but ourselves as well!Kids from the indigenous community of Shukshuyaku playing in the chacra-huertoWhat
We Need & What You Get
We have set our funding goal at
$29,000. The bulk of the funds will go toward production and distribution costs,
but will also include travel and accommodations to and from Peru where we will
be filming. We have lots of awesome perks to offer as a thank you for your
support no matter how large or small the contribution, including up to a 7 day
stay at the beautiful Sachamama Center in Lamas, Peru, hand-painted Sachamama
t-shirts, DVDs and books to name a few, and these are also covered by our
funding goal. A view of the Sachamama Center for Biocultural Regeneration Challenges

<p>John Stramen is a writer who struggles to come up with an idea for his next novel after his break-out hit ‘Dark Strings’. He lives in a secluded mountainous village with his dog and works as a woodchopper during the day to pay the bills. He moved there after the death of his wife, hoping he would find inspiration and peace. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He spends most of his nights sketching a cloaked figure he saw in his dreams, and believes to be haunted by it as he continuously sees it in the forest and around his house. All the while, he has become victim of childish pranks that seem to get more violent and extreme by the day. He begins to suspect that a secret from his past has come back to punish him and he becomes increasingly paranoid that one of the villagers is out to get him. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Woods is a film that plays with the themes of paranoia and guilt, and shows in an extreme way what people do to and for the people we love.</b></p>

<p>Woods is the <b>Prague Film School</b> graduation project of director <b>Sean van Leijenhorst</b> but aims to be a grandiose and professional film. The director was inspired by the works of <b>Alfred Hitchcock</b> and stories by <b>Stephen King</b>, as well as old TV shows like <b>GOOSEBUMPS</b> and <b>ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?</b> <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>The film is a short psychological horror film that is meant to slowly creep under your skin, and hopefully, leave a terrifying impression.</b></p>

<h3><b>The Crew: </b></h3>
<p>We managed to assemble a large multinational crew of professionals who were enthusiastic about the script and believed in the film. </p>
<p><b>We had people in our crew from over 15 countries worldwide! </b></p>
<p>The crew came from Netherlands/Ireland, Venezuela/Uruguay, France, Belgium, Portugal, Canada, Greek, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Uruguay/Peru and Cuba. </p>

<p>Sean has been making short films for a while now. To master his craft he moved to Prague to study at the Prague Film School and this film is his graduation project. He's always been an avid fan of horror films and previously made a successful psychological horror film based on the Irish legend of the <b>Banshee</b>, which you can check out <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLQX9Rbd_6A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>! For Woods he drew inspiration from old TV shows like Goosebumps and Are You Afraid Of The Dark as well as the works of Hitchcock and Stephen King.</p>

<p>The extremely talented Cédric Larvoire has been a professional cinematographer for 10+ years and also studied at the Prague Film School. He now works as a freelancer working both on documentary and fiction films, as well as shooting most of Skoda Auto commercials in Prague. Woods was a refreshing project for Cedric as he had to adapt to the project's '<b>magical realism</b>' as his regular style tends to lean more towards realism.</p>

<p>Brigitte could not have been more perfect for the project of Woods. Already as a child she was interested in puppeteering, creating and manipulation her own puppets. Considering the film features the use of puppets we couldn't have been more happy to have Brigitte on board. As an adult she works mainly in theater with the <b>Prague Shakespeare Company</b> as the prop designer, as well as assistant stage manager. She also has her own workshop in Prague, Dark Smile Studios, where she creates all sort of puppets, masks and things.  Woods is her first step in the film industry, and since she loves horror films and monsters Woods was a great first project for her. <b>Some of her work are included in the perks, see below, like the terrifying masks of the film's antagonists.</b> See her work <a href=""http://www.dark-smile-studio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p>

<p>Joana graduated from Make-up school in France as a Special Effects Make-up Artist. What does that mean? Well, if you need a throat cut, a prosthetic arm or a demonic mask then Joana is the one to call. She helped us realize the many practical effects on set and made sure the actors looked good (or not so good depending on their health in the story ;) ).

<p>
</p>
<p>Pasa la mayor parte de sus noches dibujando una figura encapuchada que ve en sus sueños, y que cree lo acosa porque la sigue viendo en el bosque y alrededor de su casa. Al mismo tiempo, se ha convertido en la víctima de juegos, inicialmente inocentes, que se vuelven cada vez más violentos y extremos. John empieza a sospechar que un secreto de su pasado ha vuelto para castigarlo; su paranoia aumenta hasta pensar que algún habitante del pueblo le persigue.</p>
<p>

<p>‘Woods’ (Bosque) es un cortometraje que juega con los temas de paranoia y culpa, y los muestra de una manera extrema a través de lo que las personas serian capaces de hacer por los seres que aman.</p>

<h3><b>PŘÍBĚH</b></h3>
<p>John Stramen je spisovatel, který se po vydání
svého knižního hitu „Temné struny“ potýká s nedostatkem nápadů pro svůj
nový román. Žije v izolované horské vesnici jen se svým psem a aby se
uživil, pracuje přes den jako dřevorubec. Do vesnice se přestěhoval po smrti své
ženy doufaje, že tam najde inspiraci a klid na psaní.</p>
<p>Většinu nocí tráví skicováním postavy zahalené
v plášti, kterou vídá ve svých snech. Věří, že ho tato tajemná postava
straší, protože ji několikrát spatří i v lese nebo v blízkosti svého
domu. Aby toho nebylo málo, John se zároveň stává obětí dětinských žertíků
neznámého původu, které se však postupně stávají čím dál agresivnějšími a
extrémnějšími. Začíná nabývat podezření, že ho dohání jisté tajemství
z jeho minulosti, které se ho snaží potrestat, a čím dál více trpí
paranoidní představou, že ho jeden z vesničanů chce zabít.</p>

(Česká verze následuje po španělské)
 

John Stramen is a writer who struggles to come up with an idea for his next novel after his break-out hit ‘Dark Strings’. He lives in a secluded mountainous village with his dog and works as a woodchopper during the day to pay the bills. He moved there after the death of his wife, hoping he would find inspiration and peace. 


He spends most of his nights sketching a cloaked figure he saw in his dreams, and believes to be haunted by it as he continuously sees it in the forest and around his house. All the while, he has become victim of childish pranks that seem to get more violent and extreme by the day. He begins to suspect that a secret from his past has come back to punish him and he becomes increasingly paranoid that one of the villagers is out to get him. 


Woods is a film that plays with the themes of paranoia and guilt, and shows in an extreme way what people do to and for the people we love.



 

Woods is the Prague Film School graduation project of director Sean van Leijenhorst but aims to be a grandiose and professional film. The director was inspired by the works of Alfred Hitchcock and stories by Stephen King, as well as old TV shows like GOOSEBUMPS and ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK? 


The film is a short psychological horror film that is meant to slowly creep under your skin, and hopefully, leave a terrifying impression.



The Crew: 
We managed to assemble a large multinational crew of professionals who were enthusiastic about the script and believed in the film. 
We had people in our crew from over 15 countries worldwide! 
The crew came from Netherlands/Ireland, Venezuela/Uruguay, France, Belgium, Portugal, Canada, Greek, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Uruguay/Peru and Cuba. 

Sean van Leijenhorst (NL) - Writer/Director



Sean has been making short films for a while now. To master his craft he moved to Prague to study at the Prague Film School and this film is his graduation project. He's always been an avid fan of horror films and previously made a successful psychological horror film based on the Irish legend of the Banshee, which you can check out here! For Woods he drew inspiration from old TV shows like Goosebumps and Are You Afraid Of The Dark as well as the works of Hitchcock and Stephen King.

Lucía Giménez Viloria (Venezuela) - Producer


Lucia has worked on many feature films as well as commercials both in the Czech Republic and in her home country Venezuela. Among them are feature film ""Un Lugar Lejano"", the popular reality show ""Te ponemos en las buenas"" and Slamdance Festival winnner ""Hank and Asha"". Woods was a special project for Lucia as it is the first horror film she's ever produced. The director assured her it's actually more fun than scary working on a horror set :) 


Cédric Larvoire (France) - Director of Photography 



The extremely talented Cédric Larvoire has been a professional cinematographer for 10+ years and also studied at the Prague Film School. He now works as a freelancer working both on documentary and fiction films, as well as shooting most of Skoda Auto commercials in Prague. Woods was a refreshing project for Cedric as he had to adapt to the project's 'magical realism' as his regular style tends to lean more towards realism.

Brigitte Dörner (Germany) - Art Director


Brigitte could not have been more perfect for the project of Woods. Already as a child she was interested in puppeteering, creating and manipulation her own puppets. Considering the film features the use of puppets we couldn't have been more happy to have Brigitte on board. As an adult she works mainly in theater with the Prague Shakespeare Company as the prop designer, as well as assistant stage manager. She also has her own workshop in Prague, Dark Smile Studios, where she creates all sort of puppets, masks and things.  Woods is her first step in the film industry, and since she loves horror films and monsters Woods was a great first project for her. Some of her work are included in the perks, see below, like the terrifying masks of the film's antagonists. See her work here. 

Joana Boulay (France) - Special FX Make-up Artist



Joana graduated from Make-up school in France as a Special Effects Make-up Artist. What does that mean? Well, if you need a throat cut, a prosthetic arm or a demonic mask then Joana is the one to call. She helped us realize the many practical effects on set and made sure the actors looked good (or not so good depending on their health in the story ;) ). You can check out some of her work here. 

Varhan Orchestrovic Bauer (Czech Republic) - Music Composer


We are proud to announce that famous Czech composer/conducter Varhan Orchestoric Bauer will provide the soundtrack for Woods! Varhan gained international notoriety for composing the soundtrack for famous Czech director Milos Forman's film 'Goya's Ghosts'. Varhan has worked as a music composer and conducter for 25+ years and has provided the scores for 20+ films. We cannot be more excited to work with him and create a terrifying soundtrack for Woods. Check out his work here. 
The cast:

David Clark (USA) - Main role as John Stramen


Dave was born and raised in Alaska, a similar setting to where Woods takes place, and started acting at a young age. In his career he has played in several big productions like 'COLOMBIANA', '99 FRANCS' and 'TAKEN 3'. Dave said Woods was a dream project for him as when he watched Tales From The Darkside as a boy he always wanted to play in a similar project. 

Eva Larvoire (France) - Side role as Beth

The immensely talented Eva Larvoire, wife of cinematographer Cedric Larvoire, previously played the main role in Sean's film Banshee, for which she was awarded the prize of 'Best Actress' by the Hollywood Reporter. Eva plays the role of Beth, a waitress and friend of John who seems to want more than just a friendship with him. 

Ted Otis (USA) - Side role as Norbert

Ted Otis plays the role of Norbert, the seemingly harmless neighbor of John. Ted, now living in Prague, makes a living by playing in commercials and fiction films. He was perfect for the part of Norbert as he could play both the calm and humoristic side of the character, as well as the darker side. 

Baako the Dog (Czech Republic)

Baako, owned by Dominika Hojdová, is an award-winning Rhodesian Ridgeback. He plays himself (pun) in the film as John's trusty four-footer. Baako is perfectly trained and was a delight to work with.

The shooting is over! We have AMAZING footage and the next step is to complete the film in post-production. To be able to complete this last stage we need money to put the film together: edit the footage and design what it will sound like, the composition and recording of the music as well as the final coloring. 
We have an amazing team of professionals helping us out with this, and although they have taken a grand interest in the story and have given us tremendous favors, given the time and effort the post-production takes it cannot be done for free. And that is why we need your help to make the film the best film we can possibly make!




Our Post-production team includes:

Cesar Mendonca (Brazil), Video editor and currently a FAMU Student for the editing program.

Tomas Patlich (Czech Republic), together with his team from Sype Studios (http://sypestudios.com/) will take care of the Sound design and the Sound mixing.
Juan Carlos Herrera (Cuba), amazing 3D animator who will prepare the end-credit titles.


The coloring will be done by the cinematographer of the film, Cédric Larvoire and the director, Sean van Leijenhorst.

Finally, the music will be composed by the greatest, Varhan Orchestrovič Bauer (http://www.varhan.cz/) and recorded with his orchestra in Prague. 

And of course the most important thing for us it to make sure as many people as possible can watch and enjoy our film! Our plan is to distribute the film throughout festivals worldwide first, and then consider home-entertainment options like VOD (Video On Demand) and other free platforms. 
We made this film with a tremendous amount of passion and love, and want to share it with as many people as possible. And you can help us with that!





We've arranged for a wide variety of awesome perks for you! 
You can choose from:


Digital version of the film
Blu-Ray of the film
The official poster of the film
The original masks (2) featured in the film
The official soundtrack by famous composer Varhan Orchestrovic Bauer
Associate and Executive Producer credits both in the film and on IMDB.com

Invitation to the official premiere in Prague
Invitation to a special screening in Prague where the soundtrack will be played live by composer Varhan Orchestrovic Bauer


OTHER WAYS TO HELP
Money isn't the only way you can help us. It would mean a great deal to us if you could simply take the time to tell your friends about the film,  share it on social media like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram so it can reach a bigger audience. 


WOODS will be released in the end of May and we'd like to thank everyone who was part of the making of the film, and that means YOU too!

La Historia


Pasa la mayor parte de sus noches dibujando una figura encapuchada que ve en sus sueños, y que cree lo acosa porque la sigue viendo en el bosque y alrededor de su casa. Al mismo tiempo, se ha convertido en la víctima de juegos, inicialmente inocentes, que se vuelven cada vez más violentos y extremos. John empieza a sospechar que un secreto de su pasado ha vuelto para castigarlo; su paranoia aumenta hasta pensar que algún habitante del pueblo le persigue.


‘Woods’ (Bosque) es un cortometraje que juega con los temas de paranoia y culpa, y los muestra de una manera extrema a través de lo que las personas serian capaces de hacer por los seres que aman.


¿Quién está detrás de éste proyecto?
Woods es el proyecto de graduación del director Sean van Leijenhorst de la Escuela de Cine de Praga, que tiene todo para convertirse en una gran película. El director se inspiró en la obra de Alfred Hitchcock y relatos de Stephen King, así como en las antiguas series de television GOOSEBUMPS y ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?

Este equipo esta formado por personas procedentes de más de 15 países del mundo! Holanda / Irlanda, Venezuela / Uruguay, Francia, Bélgica, Portugal, Canadá, Grecia, República Checa, Alemania, Italia, Uruguay / Perú y Cuba.


¿Por qué necesitamos de tu ayuda?
El rodaje ha terminado y tenemos un material INCREÍBLE! ahora el siguiente paso es terminar la post-producción. Para poder realizar esta última etapa, necesitamos contribuciones financieras para completar la película: editar el material, el diseño de sonido, la composición y grabación de la música, así como la coloración final.


Contamos con un equipo de profesionales en estas especialidades que tienen un gran interés en la historia y nos han brindado un gran apoyo, pero el tiempo y el esfuerzo de la post-producción ameritan costos de retribución que no pueden hacerse de forma gratuita. Es por eso que necesitamos tu ayuda para hacer de WOODS la mejor película!

<h3><b>Summary</b></h3> <p>Healthcare as we know it today is not meeting the needs of the American people.  It is focused on a diagnosis instead of the cause of an ailment, it is a system for profit causing out of control costs associated with our healing and there is an over dependency on pharmaceuticals and invasive surgeries.  Project HEAL America is an initiative started through our<b> non-profit </b>holistic healing center, The HEAL Center, located in Ojai, California.  Through this non-profit we have developed a ground-breaking and unique integrative healthcare model that we want to bring to the world.  Project HEAL America is a vehicle not only for us to share this new model, but also to provide a platform for Americans to share their stories of healthcare (learn more at <a href=""http://projecthealamerica.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ProjectHealAmerica.com</a>).  <b>Our mission is to do all we can to see a healthier, happier humanity!</b></p>
<p>This campaign is to raise funds for training our practitioners, securing a space large enough to implement and pilot this innovative model while collecting the data we need to show it's success.  We need lab equipment to show diagnostic improvement, space for our team approach to healing to function within and we need to hire the appropriate trainers to ensure that our Western (doctors, nurses, physical therapists, etc.) and Eastern (acupuncturists, naturopaths, herbal remedy specialists, etc.) healing practitioners are all well-versed on natural healing techniques and integrative medicine, learn to operate as a team without self-importance, and engage in their own analysis of their ego, emotional triggers and personal needs.</p>
<p>We believe that together we can create a new healthcare for humanity!</p>

<h3><b>Project specifics</b></h3>
<h4><b>Who we are: The HEAL Center</b></h4>
</div><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The HEAL Center is a holistic healing and learning center in Ojai, California.  We have 25+ holistic healing practitioners who provide our clients with natural methods of healing, balancing, and growing.  We see the effects of healing naturally on a daily basis, but realize that we are needing to bridge the gap between our system and the standard Western method of healing, which is what led us to design a system that can bring technological advancements and time-honored methods of natural healing together.</span>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1320457/files/20150323230225-NewModel.jpg?1427176945"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We have developed a model of healthcare that combines both
Western (Doctors, nurses, clinical psychologists, nutritionists, physical
therapists, etc.) and Eastern (acupuncturists, energy healers, naturopaths,
herbal medicine practitioners, ayurvedic practitioners, etc.) modalities
together to work with the whole of a person as a team to determine what they
need physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually to be the
healthiest they can be.  This system is designed to be replicable in its
business model, practitioner training model, team treatment approach and
healing approach.  There are many integrated models out there, however most of those are built from or are contained within a Western model--the very model we know is not working.  We are not bound by the requirements of the typical Western system that prevent true change from occurring.</div><div>
<h4><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>What it is like to come to the HEAL Center</b></span></h4>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When someone comes to our center they will be greeted warmly and treated as an equal in their healing.  A person may come to us for physical ailments, emotional or mental ailments, for personal growth, advice on their relationship or career or they may not know exactly why they come, they are just drawn to be there.  The first approach to our healing partnership is an initial consultation.  During this meeting the patient is asked about their mental &amp; emotional state, their physical health, their career, their relationships with colleagues, friends and family, their upbringing and their life in general.  By engaging in this collaborative analysis between the patient and practitioner we are looking at the whole person, noticing patterns and beginning to make connections between all aspects of their life.  This information is then shared with our team of practitioners who will then determine the best course of action for that individual person's healing.  The patient is a team member along with the team of practitioners and can choose to take all suggestions, some, or none of them; the team will support the patient's decision regardless of what it is.  The healing for the patient is approached from the aspect of looking for the cause of the ailment followed by the use of any of the following: education, physical remedies, mental and emotional healing and clearing, or energetic balancing.  The amount and length of appointments will be dependent on each individual with constant recommendations and support from the team.</span><br/></p>
<h4><b>We Find the Cause of an Ailment Through a Team Approach</b></h4>
<p>Our
Team of practitioners look for the cause of ailments, not just diagnose an
isolated issue and treat it with a band-aid cure or invasive pharmaceuticals
and surgeries.  </p>
<p>Through
this healthcare model, clients will engage in an intake process where they
speak about their mental, physical, emotional, and energetic well-being along
with speaking about nutrition, family, career, social life, spiritual journey,
and personal history. Based on that initial consultation, the team of health practitioners will give recommendations of a health
and healing plan that includes a multitude of healing modalities. </p>
<p>For
example one person may come to the HEAL Center for lower back pain and could receive a recommendation to engage in any of the following: emotional clearing,
x-rays, Myofascial Release, MRI, acupuncture, relationship counseling,
nutritional coaching, etc. The client then has the choice to take some, all, or
none of the recommendations made.</p>
<p>Within
this process clients may receive a diagnosis for a medical concern, however,
once again there will be no pharmaceuticals or invasive surgeries recommended
and all treatments will be holistic, natural, and non-invasive. <b>We believe the
root cause of most illnesses, conditions, and dis-ease within the body is a
result of a combination of emotional, mental and nutritional health</b>.  We
look to see what is not functioning within you to find the cause of your
physical, emotional, or mental distress, therefore finding the cure.</p>
<p>Although
we are firm with delivering only natural approaches to healing we do understand
that there are times that pharmaceuticals and surgeries are needed so we will
be prepared to refer clients to other facilities as needed.</p>
<h4><b>Holistic &amp; Natural Treatments</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1321568/files/20150324081010-all-elements.jpg?1427209810"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>A holistic model means that we explore all aspects of a person.  Our team will ask about a person emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and physically.  They will ask about a person's relationships, home life, career, upbringing, nutrition, life journey and so on so  that they can determine how your<b> life</b> is affecting your health.  Once this is explored the team can then determine the best course of action for you to heal.  Examples
of the treatments available will include naturopathic medicine, physical
therapy, nutritional counseling, Chinese medicine, body alignment and
mechanics, myofascial release, herbal remedies, energetic healing, meridian
balancing and stabilization, emotional release, mental support and countless
approaches to a natural way to treat the whole person.</p>
<h4><b>Built on a Holistic Foundation</b></h4>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1321536/files/20150324080100-two-systems-small.jpg?1427209260"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>There
are several features in this medical model that sets it apart from other
systems. Where many systems are built on the foundation of a Western medical
model and add in a few holistic approaches and practitioners into their current
system, this model is built from a holistic foundation bringing Western
practitioners in as equal team members, blending techniques and approaches to
bring about a collaborative approach to health and wellness.</p>
<h4><b>Unique Business Model that Keeps Self-Importance at Bay</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1339541/files/20150330125536-business-model.jpg?1427745336"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Another
unique feature is that this model does not support a hierarchy. All members of
this model, including a medical doctor, receptionist, registered nurse, or
holistic healing practitioner are of equal standing. Practitioners in this
model are equal team members regardless of their training or degrees. We
believe that perspective keeps self-importance at bay so that real work can be
done. Indulgence of the ego does not contribute well to balance within an
organization. After speaking with a local Naturopath she explained that she was involved in an integrated model that stemmed from the Western model.  When she arrived for her first day in this system a doctor pulled her aside and said, ""Do you see that line?  Don't cross it; this side is for naturopaths and this side is for doctors.""  We see how damaging the ego can be and it is our goal to temper that as much as we are able to ensure that our patients and colleagues are all treated with dignity and respect.  Within this model there are different roles people play and
“executive” decisions must be made, however there is no personal importance
attached to the roles we play along-side each other.  <b>Our business model
is a flower of life sphere, where all are equal, connected parts of a whole that together make an
organization run</b>.  Our front desk staff has a vital of a role as our
doctors and we keep that reality in check.</div><h4><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Unconventional Training Program</b></h4><div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A
final unique feature comes through our practitioner training program. All
practitioners, Eastern and Western, along with all staff members must be
trained in the language and basic understanding of treating someone
holistically. We have developed a series of trainings that provide a basic
understanding of concepts such as the body’s meridians, Chinese medicine, using
herbs, tinctures and remedies, the myofascial system, intuitive coaching, energetic healing, emotional releasing,
etc. The uniqueness is that in addition to technical trainings <b>we are requiring
all of our practitioners and staff to go through the same personal healing
methods we take our clients through</b> - engaging in a process of healing old
emotional baggage, personal triggers and needs, and receive ongoing support on
their own journey.</span><br/></p>
</div><h4><b>Three Phases</b></h4><div>We have designed three phases of development for our model. <b> </b>
</div><div>
<b>Phase I </b>is our training and pilot phase, which this Indiegogo Campaign is funding.   Phase I is the most critical phase in that it:</div><div>
<ul>
<li>Sets up and validates our Western &amp; Eastern practitioner training model </li>
<li>Solidifies our practitioners operating as a true team to support client healing</li>
<li>Provides the ability to collect diagnostic data to show our system is effective</li>
<li>Demonstrates our unique ""spherical"" business model that removes self-importance and ego from our system</li>
<li>Allows us to pilot our system to work through intended and unintended intervening variables that may prevent our model from becoming replicable</li>
</ul>Once we have our model in a position that it has proven effective, has operated successfully, and can be replicable we can then not only expand our operation, but we can begin promoting the vision around the country and potentially around the world.  </div><div>
<b>Phase II</b> is where we integrate and expand into areas such as:</div><div>
<ul>
<li>Natural birthing</li>
<li>Transitioning services</li>
<li>Natural dentistry</li>
<li>Growing our own medicinal herbs</li>
<li>Long-term care for those moving through tough life experiences</li>
<li>Expanding our Integrative Training Model to be offered to the public</li>
<li>Developing a training and business model manual so that others can replicate the system</li>
</ul>During this phase we will begin our<b> income-based fee scale</b> where those living below the poverty line will have the ability to receive services according to their income.  Our current HEAL Center offers donation only clinics twice a month and these will expand into our integrated system as often as we are able.</div><div>Phase II will also offer our training model to those outside of our system.  As we stated above, our training model provides a common understanding and common language for understanding and working within a system of natural treatment.  In addition, it brings practitioners through an analysis of their own ego, self-importance, emotional triggers, and personal needs.  By self-examining these personal aspects practitioners are better able to meet patients with humility and compassion.</div><div>
<b>Phase III</b> allows us to expand even farther into developing retreat centers that will allow us to bring this model, the wisdom that it brings, and the self-healing techniques it offers to the masses.  We will expand into services for the homeless and at-risk.  It will also expand into physically building these centers around our country and our world.  </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are asking for $111,000.  These funds are to go toward training our practitioners, securing a space large enough to implement and pilot this new model while collecting the data we need to show it's success.  We need lab equipment to show diagnostic improvement, space for our team approach to healing to function within and we need to hire the appropriate trainers to ensure that our Western and Eastern healing practitioners are all well versed on natural healing techniques &amp; integrative medicine, learn to operate as a team without self-importance, and engage in their own analysis of their ego, emotional triggers and personal needs.</p>
<p>As you can see in the pie chart below we allot a significant amount of our funding toward project management and marketing &amp; promoting our model.  We want to be transparent about the reality that if we want to see this model become replicable around the globe we need to make sure that people know about it.  That takes time, effort and manpower.  We are committed to seeing this happen and encourage you to view the specific biographies of the team we have pulled together to make this happen.  </p>

<p></p>
<p></p>Project HEAL America and this campaign are all about changing the current model of healthcare and proving to the world that <b>ego, profit, isolated diagnoses, and invasive pharmaceuticals and surgeries do not have to be standard protocol</b>.  We are here to impact all of us.  Although we are only one team, we can reach far and wide with what we have developed.  We also know that to affect a true change of the system, the wayshower cannot come from within the current system; there is too much tradition, ego, and bureaucracy that will hinder the type of change we are looking to bring about.  By us creating change outside of the system we have the freedom we need to show its effectiveness without barriers.</div><h4>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why is this valuable to you?</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  </span>
</h4><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you want to see change, we need to band together.  This impacts you, as the potential patient of a system like this one, in that our model can be replicated around the globe.  Once we have the kinks worked out–how to team, how to operate without ego, how to bill with the sliding fee scale, how to have enough knowledge about each others' practices, etc.–we can create training and operation manuals for our system to be built in your home town. </span></div><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In addition, our model has features that utilize technology so that distance is not a barrier to your healing.  We use video streaming, phone conferencing, and online classrooms often and will continue that method of healing in the new center.  If physical diagnostic assessments or examinations need to be performed they can be done in your home town and we can guide you through an analysis of treatment from a distance.  Our distance clients find just as much of an impact in healing as those who are with us physically.</span></div><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are willing to help others develop similar systems in other towns and since we are a non-profit organization, we are more interested in seeing this happen than lining our pockets by holding things close to the vest.  </span> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We have been very realistic about our implementation of our system.  We believe our greatest challenges will be:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Learning to operate as a team, not due to ego, but due to logistics and communication.  It is difficult to organize efficiency to the level that moves into true performance.   Although we know that we will reach the performance stage, we understand that when dealing with multiple personalities, multiple opinions, and multiple clients there are always bumps along the way.</li>
<li>Without intending confrontation or to ruffle feathers, we understand that there may be pharmaceutical companies or medical organizations who are threatened by what we have created and they may not want to see us succeed.  We are taking this into account by making sure that we are documenting, measuring and operating with the utmost care and professionalism.  We see our transparency about everything we are doing–financially, treatment-wise, or as an organization–as our saving grace to allow us to continue operating as the intended model outlines.</li>
<li>One other challenge will be to grow at a pace that can ensure integrity to the model. As we stated above, we can only go as fast as our slowest parts can move. Growing too fast can damage an organization and warp the intended model so we are moving forward conscious of this potential risk.   We know people want this model of healthcare, but realize that we can only serve the amount of people we have capacity to assist with honor and integrity.  Since we are not for profit, we are not interested in quantity, we are interested in quality.</li>
</ul>

Summary Healthcare as we know it today is not meeting the needs of the American people.  It is focused on a diagnosis instead of the cause of an ailment, it is a system for profit causing out of control costs associated with our healing and there is an over dependency on pharmaceuticals and invasive surgeries.  Project HEAL America is an initiative started through our non-profit holistic healing center, The HEAL Center, located in Ojai, California.  Through this non-profit we have developed a ground-breaking and unique integrative healthcare model that we want to bring to the world.  Project HEAL America is a vehicle not only for us to share this new model, but also to provide a platform for Americans to share their stories of healthcare (learn more at ProjectHealAmerica.com).  Our mission is to do all we can to see a healthier, happier humanity!
This campaign is to raise funds for training our practitioners, securing a space large enough to implement and pilot this innovative model while collecting the data we need to show it's success.  We need lab equipment to show diagnostic improvement, space for our team approach to healing to function within and we need to hire the appropriate trainers to ensure that our Western (doctors, nurses, physical therapists, etc.) and Eastern (acupuncturists, naturopaths, herbal remedy specialists, etc.) healing practitioners are all well-versed on natural healing techniques and integrative medicine, learn to operate as a team without self-importance, and engage in their own analysis of their ego, emotional triggers and personal needs.
We believe that together we can create a new healthcare for humanity!

Project specifics
Who we are: The HEAL Center

The HEAL Center is a holistic healing and learning center in Ojai, California.  We have 25+ holistic healing practitioners who provide our clients with natural methods of healing, balancing, and growing.  We see the effects of healing naturally on a daily basis, but realize that we are needing to bridge the gap between our system and the standard Western method of healing, which is what led us to design a system that can bring technological advancements and time-honored methods of natural healing together.

Project HEAL America
This project’s intent is to unite people in our shared desire to see healthcare transform into a system that supports true healing.  We believe that true healing is attained by finding the cause of an ailment as opposed to simply diagnosing and treating it in isolation from other issues within the being.  We also believe that our healthcare system cannot be driven from greed, power, conflict of interest, or ego.  To unite people together we are asking for people to not only support the development of this new system, we are providing a platform for people to share their stories of how they healed naturally, how the current system failed them, or both.   Learn more about this initiative and submit your story at ProjectHealAmerica.com. 
Our new model of healthcare: HEAL Center for Integrative Health and Wellness



We have developed a model of healthcare that combines both
Western (Doctors, nurses, clinical psychologists, nutritionists, physical
therapists, etc.) and Eastern (acupuncturists, energy healers, naturopaths,
herbal medicine practitioners, ayurvedic practitioners, etc.) modalities
together to work with the whole of a person as a team to determine what they
need physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually to be the
healthiest they can be.  This system is designed to be replicable in its
business model, practitioner training model, team treatment approach and
healing approach.  There are many integrated models out there, however most of those are built from or are contained within a Western model--the very model we know is not working.  We are not bound by the requirements of the typical Western system that prevent true change from occurring.
What it is like to come to the HEAL Center
When someone comes to our center they will be greeted warmly and treated as an equal in their healing.  A person may come to us for physical ailments, emotional or mental ailments, for personal growth, advice on their relationship or career or they may not know exactly why they come, they are just drawn to be there.  The first approach to our healing partnership is an initial consultation.  During this meeting the patient is asked about their mental & emotional state, their physical health, their career, their relationships with colleagues, friends and family, their upbringing and their life in general.  By engaging in this collaborative analysis between the patient and practitioner we are looking at the whole person, noticing patterns and beginning to make connections between all aspects of their life.  This information is then shared with our team of practitioners who will then determine the best course of action for that individual person's healing.  The patient is a team member along with the team of practitioners and can choose to take all suggestions, some, or none of them; the team will support the patient's decision regardless of what it is.  The healing for the patient is approached from the aspect of looking for the cause of the ailment followed by the use of any of the following: education, physical remedies, mental and emotional healing and clearing, or energetic balancing.  The amount and length of appointments will be dependent on each individual with constant recommendations and support from the team.
We Find the Cause of an Ailment Through a Team Approach
Our
Team of practitioners look for the cause of ailments, not just diagnose an
isolated issue and treat it with a band-aid cure or invasive pharmaceuticals
and surgeries.  
Through
this healthcare model, clients will engage in an intake process where they
speak about their mental, physical, emotional, and energetic well-being along
with speaking about nutrition, family, career, social life, spiritual journey,
and personal history. Based on that initial consultation, the team of health practitioners will give recommendations of a health
and healing plan that includes a multitude of healing modalities. 
For
example one person may come to the HEAL Center for lower back pain and could receive a recommendation to engage in any of the following: emotional clearing,
x-rays, Myofascial Release, MRI, acupuncture, relationship counseling,
nutritional coaching, etc. The client then has the choice to take some, all, or
none of the recommendations made.
Within
this process clients may receive a diagnosis for a medical concern, however,
once again there will be no pharmaceuticals or invasive surgeries recommended
and all treatments will be holistic, natural, and non-invasive. We believe the
root cause of most illnesses, conditions, and dis-ease within the body is a
result of a combination of emotional, mental and nutritional health.  We
look to see what is not functioning within you to find the cause of your
physical, emotional, or mental distress, therefore finding the cure.
Although
we are firm with delivering only natural approaches to healing we do understand
that there are times that pharmaceuticals and surgeries are needed so we will
be prepared to refer clients to other facilities as needed.
Holistic & Natural Treatments


A holistic model means that we explore all aspects of a person.  Our team will ask about a person emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and physically.  They will ask about a person's relationships, home life, career, upbringing, nutrition, life journey and so on so  that they can determine how your life is affecting your health.  Once this is explored the team can then determine the best course of action for you to heal.  Examples
of the treatments available will include naturopathic medicine, physical
therapy, nutritional counseling, Chinese medicine, body alignment and
mechanics, myofascial release, herbal remedies, energetic healing, meridian
balancing and stabilization, emotional release, mental support and countless
approaches to a natural way to treat the whole person.
Built on a Holistic Foundation



There
are several features in this medical model that sets it apart from other
systems. Where many systems are built on the foundation of a Western medical
model and add in a few holistic approaches and practitioners into their current
system, this model is built from a holistic foundation bringing Western
practitioners in as equal team members, blending techniques and approaches to
bring about a collaborative approach to health and wellness.
Unique Business Model that Keeps Self-Importance at Bay

Another
unique feature is that this model does not support a hierarchy. All members of
this model, including a medical doctor, receptionist, registered nurse, or
holistic healing practitioner are of equal standing. Practitioners in this
model are equal team members regardless of their training or degrees. We
believe that perspective keeps self-importance at bay so that real work can be
done. Indulgence of the ego does not contribute well to balance within an
organization. After speaking with a local Naturopath she explained that she was involved in an integrated model that stemmed from the Western model.  When she arrived for her first day in this system a doctor pulled her aside and said, ""Do you see that line?  Don't cross it; this side is for naturopaths and this side is for doctors.""  We see how damaging the ego can be and it is our goal to temper that as much as we are able to ensure that our patients and colleagues are all treated with dignity and respect.  Within this model there are different roles people play and
“executive” decisions must be made, however there is no personal importance
attached to the roles we play along-side each other.  Our business model
is a flower of life sphere, where all are equal, connected parts of a whole that together make an
organization run.  Our front desk staff has a vital of a role as our
doctors and we keep that reality in check.Unconventional Training Program
A
final unique feature comes through our practitioner training program. All
practitioners, Eastern and Western, along with all staff members must be
trained in the language and basic understanding of treating someone
holistically. We have developed a series of trainings that provide a basic
understanding of concepts such as the body’s meridians, Chinese medicine, using
herbs, tinctures and remedies, the myofascial system, intuitive coaching, energetic healing, emotional releasing,
etc. The uniqueness is that in addition to technical trainings we are requiring
all of our practitioners and staff to go through the same personal healing
methods we take our clients through - engaging in a process of healing old
emotional baggage, personal triggers and needs, and receive ongoing support on
their own journey.
Three PhasesWe have designed three phases of development for our model.  

Phase I is our training and pilot phase, which this Indiegogo Campaign is funding.   Phase I is the most critical phase in that it:

Sets up and validates our Western & Eastern practitioner training model 
Solidifies our practitioners operating as a true team to support client healing
Provides the ability to collect diagnostic data to show our system is effective
Demonstrates our unique ""spherical"" business model that removes self-importance and ego from our system
Allows us to pilot our system to work through intended and unintended intervening variables that may prevent our model from becoming replicable
Once we have our model in a position that it has proven effective, has operated successfully, and can be replicable we can then not only expand our operation, but we can begin promoting the vision around the country and potentially around the world.  
Phase II is where we integrate and expand into areas such as:

Natural birthing
Transitioning services
Natural dentistry
Growing our own medicinal herbs
Long-term care for those moving through tough life experiences
Expanding our Integrative Training Model to be offered to the public
Developing a training and business model manual so that others can replicate the system
During this phase we will begin our income-based fee scale where those living below the poverty line will have the ability to receive services according to their income.  Our current HEAL Center offers donation only clinics twice a month and these will expand into our integrated system as often as we are able.Phase II will also offer our training model to those outside of our system.  As we stated above, our training model provides a common understanding and common language for understanding and working within a system of natural treatment.  In addition, it brings practitioners through an analysis of their own ego, self-importance, emotional triggers, and personal needs.  By self-examining these personal aspects practitioners are better able to meet patients with humility and compassion.
Phase III allows us to expand even farther into developing retreat centers that will allow us to bring this model, the wisdom that it brings, and the self-healing techniques it offers to the masses.  We will expand into services for the homeless and at-risk.  It will also expand into physically building these centers around our country and our world.    What We Need & What You Get We are asking for $111,000.  These funds are to go toward training our practitioners, securing a space large enough to implement and pilot this new model while collecting the data we need to show it's success.  We need lab equipment to show diagnostic improvement, space for our team approach to healing to function within and we need to hire the appropriate trainers to ensure that our Western and Eastern healing practitioners are all well versed on natural healing techniques & integrative medicine, learn to operate as a team without self-importance, and engage in their own analysis of their ego, emotional triggers and personal needs.
As you can see in the pie chart below we allot a significant amount of our funding toward project management and marketing & promoting our model.  We want to be transparent about the reality that if we want to see this model become replicable around the globe we need to make sure that people know about it.  That takes time, effort and manpower.  We are committed to seeing this happen and encourage you to view the specific biographies of the team we have pulled together to make this happen.  


If we do not reach our goal through this campaign we will still be moving forward with our vision.  Nothing will stop us, however, it may be significantly delayed as we work to raise the necessary funds.  We will do as much as we can with the funding we receive.  As we see it, we can start small and build slowly or we can bring our vision into a reality through the phases we have developed.  Regardless of our funding we know this system will come to fruition eventually, it is, however, based on the funding that determines how steadily we move forward.  We do not believe in moving faster than our slowest parts need to develop, but we do also realize that we cannot move forward even with our slowest parts--those that need to develop with calculated precision-- if we do not have the funding to do so.    The Impact

Project HEAL America and this campaign are all about changing the current model of healthcare and proving to the world that ego, profit, isolated diagnoses, and invasive pharmaceuticals and surgeries do not have to be standard protocol.  We are here to impact all of us.  Although we are only one team, we can reach far and wide with what we have developed.  We also know that to affect a true change of the system, the wayshower cannot come from within the current system; there is too much tradition, ego, and bureaucracy that will hinder the type of change we are looking to bring about.  By us creating change outside of the system we have the freedom we need to show its effectiveness without barriers.

If you want to see change, we need to band together.  This impacts you, as the potential patient of a system like this one, in that our model can be replicated around the globe.  Once we have the kinks worked out–how to team, how to operate without ego, how to bill with the sliding fee scale, how to have enough knowledge about each others' practices, etc.–we can create training and operation manuals for our system to be built in your home town. In addition, our model has features that utilize technology so that distance is not a barrier to your healing.  We use video streaming, phone conferencing, and online classrooms often and will continue that method of healing in the new center.  If physical diagnostic assessments or examinations need to be performed they can be done in your home town and we can guide you through an analysis of treatment from a distance.  Our distance clients find just as much of an impact in healing as those who are with us physically.
We are willing to help others develop similar systems in other towns and since we are a non-profit organization, we are more interested in seeing this happen than lining our pockets by holding things close to the vest.     Risks & Challenges We have been very realistic about our implementation of our system.  We believe our greatest challenges will be:


Learning to operate as a team, not due to ego, but due to logistics and communication.  It is difficult to organize efficiency to the level that moves into true performance.   Although we know that we will reach the performance stage, we understand that when dealing with multiple personalities, multiple opinions, and multiple clients there are always bumps along the way.
Without intending confrontation or to ruffle feathers, we understand that there may be pharmaceutical companies or medical organizations who are threatened by what we have created and they may not want to see us succeed.  We are taking this into account by making sure that we are documenting, measuring and operating with the utmost care and professionalism.  We see our transparency about everything we are doing–financially, treatment-wise, or as an organization–as our saving grace to allow us to continue operating as the intended model outlines.
One other challenge will be to grow at a pace that can ensure integrity to the model. As we stated above, we can only go as fast as our slowest parts can move. Growing too fast can damage an organization and warp the intended model so we are moving forward conscious of this potential risk.   We know people want this model of healthcare, but realize that we can only serve the amount of people we have capacity to assist with honor and integrity.  Since we are not for profit, we are not interested in quantity, we are interested in quality.

    Other Ways You Can Help We know not everyone has the ability to contribute financially, so here are a few ways you can help:  Help us spread the word!!  Post our video on your Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Blog, or really...anywhere!  We need to have people see what we are doing!  Email friends and family about this, talk about it with people and get them excited about the changes we are making.

CUBAN FILM NEEDS YOUR CONTRIBUTION  </b><i>The founding father of Afro-Cuban Cinema; Sergio Giral is helping bring the black Cuban experience
onto the screen.  </i>Karen Juanita
Carrillo, BFM  </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>THE INVISIBLE COLOR:  BLACK IS MORE THAN A COLOR</b></p><p></p><p><b>THE STORY                                                                                                                           </b></p><p>
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>DOCUMENTARY STATEMENT</b></p>
<p>This documentary investigates the black Cuban exile in South
Florida, since the first wave of political refugees in the 1959 revolutionary
aftermath, to today. It tracks its presence throughout the region, and
highlights its contribution to Miami’s civic culture through testimonies and
visual documentation.</p>
<p>While any visitor to Cuba will notice the ubiquitous
presence of Afro-descendants everywhere, and they have become the public image
of the post-Soviet Cuban diaspora in Europe and around the world, black Cubans
are invisible in the biggest Cuban enclave outside Cuba: South Florida. The
Miami exile is white.  The Cuban revolution exodus
occluded a U.S. civil rights movement in which the newcomers, by and large, did
not participate, setting Miami in “an alternative path for race relations,”
according to historians. Consequently, the city has remained one of the most
segregated and racially unequal in the country, and black Cubans have tended to
bypass it for friendlier places farther north and west. Research has shown, in
addition, that those who stayed did not benefit from the enclave’s economic and
social networks, and in the context of a lingering residential segregation,
settled in black neighborhoods and integrated into the African American
community within one generation. The result is that the faces of Cuban exile
are exclusively white. </p>
<p>Today, only about 2% of all Cubans living in South Florida
identify as non-white, and the city of Hialeah, which features the largest
Cuban population in the U.S. (over two thirds of the total), is 97% white. This
demographic invisibility of black Cubans is related not only to their relative
size vis-a-vis the white Cuban community. It is also related to several
cultural facts: one is that Cubans define race as color, rather than in the
U.S. as ancestry. Someone looking white is white, and there is not a one-drop
rule. Another is that the Cuban racial classification includes the intermediate
category of “mulatto-a,” further works to make Afro-Cubans invisible, as many
–aware of their racially mixed heritage- identify themselves as “other,” rather
than as black. A third is the stigmatization of blackness, as identified with
poverty and therefore with undesirability. Indeed, black Cubans have the
highest poverty index of all black and non-black racial and ethnic groups in
Dade County, according to a recent study by the county’s Community Relations
department.  </p>
<p>The Invisible Color seeks to both address and redress this
silence, and showcase Afro-Cubans’ experiences in Miami as both exiles and
immigrants, their relations with their white co-nationals as well as with other

CUBAN FILM NEEDS YOUR CONTRIBUTION  The founding father of Afro-Cuban Cinema; Sergio Giral is helping bring the black Cuban experience

THE INVISIBLE COLOR:  BLACK IS MORE THAN A COLORTHE STORY                                                                                                                           
DOCUMENTARY STATEMENT
This documentary investigates the black Cuban exile in South
Florida, since the first wave of political refugees in the 1959 revolutionary
aftermath, to today. It tracks its presence throughout the region, and
highlights its contribution to Miami’s civic culture through testimonies and
visual documentation.
While any visitor to Cuba will notice the ubiquitous
presence of Afro-descendants everywhere, and they have become the public image
of the post-Soviet Cuban diaspora in Europe and around the world, black Cubans
are invisible in the biggest Cuban enclave outside Cuba: South Florida. The
Miami exile is white.  The Cuban revolution exodus
occluded a U.S. civil rights movement in which the newcomers, by and large, did
not participate, setting Miami in “an alternative path for race relations,”
according to historians. Consequently, the city has remained one of the most
segregated and racially unequal in the country, and black Cubans have tended to
bypass it for friendlier places farther north and west. Research has shown, in
addition, that those who stayed did not benefit from the enclave’s economic and
social networks, and in the context of a lingering residential segregation,
settled in black neighborhoods and integrated into the African American
community within one generation. The result is that the faces of Cuban exile
are exclusively white. 
Today, only about 2% of all Cubans living in South Florida
identify as non-white, and the city of Hialeah, which features the largest
Cuban population in the U.S. (over two thirds of the total), is 97% white. This
demographic invisibility of black Cubans is related not only to their relative
size vis-a-vis the white Cuban community. It is also related to several
cultural facts: one is that Cubans define race as color, rather than in the
U.S. as ancestry. Someone looking white is white, and there is not a one-drop
rule. Another is that the Cuban racial classification includes the intermediate
category of “mulatto-a,” further works to make Afro-Cubans invisible, as many
–aware of their racially mixed heritage- identify themselves as “other,” rather
than as black. A third is the stigmatization of blackness, as identified with
poverty and therefore with undesirability. Indeed, black Cubans have the
highest poverty index of all black and non-black racial and ethnic groups in
Dade County, according to a recent study by the county’s Community Relations
department.  
The Invisible Color seeks to both address and redress this
silence, and showcase Afro-Cubans’ experiences in Miami as both exiles and
immigrants, their relations with their white co-nationals as well as with other
resident groups and the city at large.
