<p>Deeply influenced by the power of plants, animals and natural elements, the Shipibo are an indigenous community in the Amazon Rainforest of Peru, who are fighting to protect their culture and maintain their ancestral knowledge, despite years of invasion and colonisation.</p>
<p>This is a story we are all too familiar with — an indigenous community breaking down and now their knowledge and traditions threatened.</p>
<p><strong>The story of the Shipibo and their Onanyas has never be told in such detail and depth.</strong></p>
<p>The Shipibo culture is at risk of extinction. The last generations to speak Shipibo are dying out. With that comes the loss of thousands of years of knowledge, art and medicine. By supporting this project, we have the opportunity, as a collective, to help preserve and strengthen this very special culture.</p>
<p>This documentary will help the Shipibo people by stimulating a more conscious and direct economic growth to local people, help support cultural and educational programmes that have been created by the family featured in the documentary. This will keep their culture strong by keeping local children in the local area rather than migrating to larger cities.</p>

<p><strong>Maestro Feliciano Marquez Pinedo</strong> is the eldest Son of Mama Rosa. Feliciano’s Shipibo name is <strong>Kanan Betsa</strong> which means a man with a good profile and talented in business. Feliciano became very ill when he was 39. He sought out a local plant healer named Wakapoko who was able to treat him and who imparted significant knowledge of plant medicines to Feliciano. When he was recovered, he furthered his studies by completing a 9 year apprenticeship with shaman Daniel Ramos. Prior to working at the Pachamama Temple, Feliciano worked in multiple centers in the city of Tarapoto and other parts of Peru.</p>

A doctor told them that Genaro would die this way, therefore leaving Mama Rosa and Feliciano responsible for his death. They spent over one year healing Genaro’s leg through ceremonies and rituals that would put Mama Rosa’s mastery to the test. Genaro had to go through many master plant diets himself to engage with the healing process. Through this process, he became a trainee Onanya and healer, passing on his gratitude and healing hundreds of people since.</p>

<h3>ANTINO-WHO?</h3>
<p><strong>Antinous was the lover of the Roman Emperor Hadrian,</strong> and -upon his death by drowning in the Nile- was deified, as was custom in Egypt in those days.  The cultus started by his beloved Hadrian lasted for centuries.  We of the<strong> <a href=""https://naosantinoou.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Náos Antínoou: A Temple of Antinous</a> </strong>are a syncretist reconstructionist community, and we revived the cultus to Antinous as He relates to our LGBTQ+ community in these modern times. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>The Náos provides space for practicing devotion to Antinous, participation in His Sacred Mysteries, and together we seek the promotion of social and spiritual justice.</i></p>
<p>Visit our <a href=""https://naosantinoou.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u><strong>website</strong></u> </a>or our <strong><a href=""https://naosantinoou.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Náos FB Page</a></strong> for more information.</p>
<h3>ANTINO-WHAT?</h3>
<p>We offer this dedicated Temple space at Pantheacon to the larger community, where we will <strong>practice regular Devotionals to the Gods</strong>, <strong>provide a safe space for LGBTQ+ people to meet</strong> in friendship and kinship, and will offer <strong>opportunities for participating in Rites of Passage for Transformation, Affirmation, and Healing</strong>.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>We invite folks to bring statues and images of their Queer and Queer-friendly Gods, and of their Beloved and Mighty Dead, to share in the cultus during the weekend.  <strong>ALL GODS AND DIVINE BEINGS ARE WELCOME TO PARTY WITH ANTINOUS! </strong> All personal items must be picked up by Sunday night.  </i></p>
<p>Schedule of rites and devotionals to be announced at the convention. The Naos is open to devotees of all genders and sexualities.  Check out the <strong><u><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/naos-antinoou-temple-of-antinous-hospitality-room/x/20056298#/faq"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FAQ</a> </u></strong>for more information on all this.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>ANTINO-WHY? </h3>
<p>As part of our regular practice, during our Rituals we always do a Divination, and sometimes we even engage in Oracular / Possession Work.  In the past year, a few of us have received strong, unmistakable, and repeated instructions from our Beautiful Boy (Antinous) to make His blessings, divine healing, and acceptance available to more people in the Pagan / Polytheist LGBTQ+  world.  To this end, we decided to begin with the largest gathering of our kin at PantheaCon 2019.  We are grateful to the organizers for accepting our proposal.<br/><br/>We are a small Temple, and do not seek to profit from any of our events and rituals.  We intend to offer this Temple as a labour of love and devotion to Antinous.  Alas, as a small group who never charges for rituals and does not receive tithes, our resources are limited. Hence, we seek the assistance of our LGBTQ+ kin, and of all Polytheists who might be inclined to support this all-inclusive space.</p>
<h3><strong>ANTINO-GOAL $1500</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Our <strong>goal of $1500 </strong>is to offset as much as possible the costs we expect to incur for the Hospitality Temple.</li>
<li>Your donations will go to the cost of the room; the food and other supplies for sacred offerings; the welcome snacks and beverages for our visitors; the pamphlets and other informational materials; the badge ribbons; the mailing costs for some of the perks;  the gas for the extra car we are bringing to carry the Temple furnishings; as well as take into consideration Indiegogo's fees and 6 month reserve. </li>
<li>All the perks are made / donated by us, or by our friends and supporters.  We want to provide healthy snacks, offerings to the Gods for visitors to worship and devote to the Gods, as well as a nurturing atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>ANTINO-STRETCH $ 2000</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>This stretch goal would enable the Temple to purchase official stoles for our Mystai, Mystagogue, and Temple Assistants (our Priesthood titles), with Antinous' symbols on it, embroidered by a friendly local Pagan merchant. The cost for these will be around $35-45 each, and we currently need ten.</li>
<li>Our stretch goal would also help cover some of our Temple Initiates' travel costs from WA to CA, and lighten their burden if possible.  As most people, we are all on fairly limited income, and anything helps.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>ANTINO-PERKS</strong></h3>
<p>We want to make sure that you, our contributing Temple-Raiser, feels appreciated.  We have sourced some small perks from our merry band of Temple members and friends, and we hope they will feed your soul as you feed Antinous with your offerings. </p>
<ul>
<li>Each item will be charged by Temple Initiates with Antinous' blessings of Healing and Acceptance at one of our local PNW Temple Rituals in the upcoming weeks</li>

</div><div><h3>ANTINO-RISKS</h3></div><div><p>There are no risks of the Temple not happening, as a couple of us have already agreed to carry the full cost of all needed, even if we do not reach the full goal, and the room is already paid for.  Hence, we are doing this as a Flexible Funding goal, meaning we will take whatever you generously donate and use it towards the costs listed, and pay for the rest ourselves.<br/>However, that would be a heavy responsibility and strain on our personal finances.  <br/>Any amount we get will be helpful to offset our personal gift to Antinous and the mandate He entrusted us with.  </p></div><div>

<h3><strong>ANTINO-THANKS!</strong></h3>
<p>The members of the <strong><a href=""https://naosantinoou.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Náos Antínoou: A Temple of Antinous</a> </strong>thank you, and bless all of you in the name of the Beautiful Boy:  may He bring you healing dreams, peaceful days, and loving acceptance of your magnificent selves in this world of ours.<br/><br/><strong>In service to Antinous and the Gods, we remain truly grateful to you all.<br/>Jay &amp; Ceinan, with Merri-Todd, Duffi, Sister Krissy, Gabriel, and Otter, and all our local PNW Temple friends.  </strong></p>
</div><p> </p></div>","ANTINO-WHO?
Antinous was the lover of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, and -upon his death by drowning in the Nile- was deified, as was custom in Egypt in those days.  The cultus started by his beloved Hadrian lasted for centuries.  We of the Náos Antínoou: A Temple of Antinous are a syncretist reconstructionist community, and we revived the cultus to Antinous as He relates to our LGBTQ+ community in these modern times. 
The Náos provides space for practicing devotion to Antinous, participation in His Sacred Mysteries, and together we seek the promotion of social and spiritual justice.
Visit our website or our Náos FB Page for more information.
ANTINO-WHAT?
We offer this dedicated Temple space at Pantheacon to the larger community, where we will practice regular Devotionals to the Gods, provide a safe space for LGBTQ+ people to meet in friendship and kinship, and will offer opportunities for participating in Rites of Passage for Transformation, Affirmation, and Healing.  
We invite folks to bring statues and images of their Queer and Queer-friendly Gods, and of their Beloved and Mighty Dead, to share in the cultus during the weekend.  ALL GODS AND DIVINE BEINGS ARE WELCOME TO PARTY WITH ANTINOUS!  All personal items must be picked up by Sunday night.  
Schedule of rites and devotionals to be announced at the convention. The Naos is open to devotees of all genders and sexualities.  Check out the FAQ for more information on all this.

ANTINO-WHY? 
As part of our regular practice, during our Rituals we always do a Divination, and sometimes we even engage in Oracular / Possession Work.  In the past year, a few of us have received strong, unmistakable, and repeated instructions from our Beautiful Boy (Antinous) to make His blessings, divine healing, and acceptance available to more people in the Pagan / Polytheist LGBTQ+  world.  To this end, we decided to begin with the largest gathering of our kin at PantheaCon 2019.  We are grateful to the organizers for accepting our proposal.We are a small Temple, and do not seek to profit from any of our events and rituals.  We intend to offer this Temple as a labour of love and devotion to Antinous.  Alas, as a small group who never charges for rituals and does not receive tithes, our resources are limited. Hence, we seek the assistance of our LGBTQ+ kin, and of all Polytheists who might be inclined to support this all-inclusive space.
ANTINO-GOAL $1500

Our goal of $1500 is to offset as much as possible the costs we expect to incur for the Hospitality Temple.
Your donations will go to the cost of the room; the food and other supplies for sacred offerings; the welcome snacks and beverages for our visitors; the pamphlets and other informational materials; the badge ribbons; the mailing costs for some of the perks;  the gas for the extra car we are bringing to carry the Temple furnishings; as well as take into consideration Indiegogo's fees and 6 month reserve. 
All the perks are made / donated by us, or by our friends and supporters.  We want to provide healthy snacks, offerings to the Gods for visitors to worship and devote to the Gods, as well as a nurturing atmosphere.

ANTINO-STRETCH $ 2000

This stretch goal would enable the Temple to purchase official stoles for our Mystai, Mystagogue, and Temple Assistants (our Priesthood titles), with Antinous' symbols on it, embroidered by a friendly local Pagan merchant. The cost for these will be around $35-45 each, and we currently need ten.
Our stretch goal would also help cover some of our Temple Initiates' travel costs from WA to CA, and lighten their burden if possible.  As most people, we are all on fairly limited income, and anything helps.

ANTINO-PERKS
We want to make sure that you, our contributing Temple-Raiser, feels appreciated.  We have sourced some small perks from our merry band of Temple members and friends, and we hope they will feed your soul as you feed Antinous with your offerings. 

Each item will be charged by Temple Initiates with Antinous' blessings of Healing and Acceptance at one of our local PNW Temple Rituals in the upcoming weeks
Items can be picked-up at PantheaCon, locally, or will be mailed right after the fundraiser closes, so end of March 2019, except for custom paintings (April 2019)

NEW - ADDED 5 Feb - BOOK ""QUEER MAGIC - BEYOND POWER BOUNDARIES"" - $20 - 10 Available

From the Publishers: ""A rare text highlighting intersectional LGBTQIA+ spirituality In a wide variety of pagan paths, many forms of modern magic and mystery hold an expectation that all parties are heterosexual, cisgender, and, in many cases, white. In Queer Magic: Power Beyond Boundaries, Lee Harrington and Tai Fenix Kulystin bring together a diverse and passionate collection of authors and artists who break out beyond that belief and explore how being LGBT+ is not just acceptable when exploring magic, but powerful. Using the diverse tools of queer activism, education, and storytelling, through academic essays and first-person narratives to comics and poster-style art, this intersectional group exposes a world beyond what so many magical practitioners have presumed is ""normal.""And here is a REVIEW on Gods & Radicals.  Don't miss a chance to get this fabulous compilation book, while helping a good cause!

A rosary is an ancient practice found in many religions, using beads to count prayers.

EGYPTIAN STYLE DIORAMA BOX - $50 - 1 availableThis 14"" x 10"" x 3"" diorama box was crafted by Mystai Ceinan on the occasion of the 2017 Megala Antinoeia, and dedicated devotionally to Antinous at the Megala Ritual.  Painted in metallic acrylics from a repurposed wooden box, the top shows a copy of a lotus motif from a Temple, with the original blue replaced by Antinous' Red Lotus on the center triad.  Antinous' name is written in Greek & latin on the side, and in Hieroglyphs in the center, copied from His Cartouche on the Obelisk of Antinous .  Opened, the side chains keep the lid vertical, and you will find a mixed-media, three-dimensional depiction of the river Nile and the desert to the North. Local plants were used for the reeds and palms, glass tiles for stylized waves, and a glass bauble for the sun;  the sand is from her own stash of Mediterranean sand, while small accents of real clay pottery, painted lotus & fish floating and hippo wading in the water, local mosses for shrubs, and other careful details complete this devotional piece dedicated to Antinous.  This piece was one of the winners of the 2017 Megal Games contest, and has been part of many of the Festivals and Devotionals of the  Náos' PNW branch.  May it bring the blessings of Antinous and all His divine Love to they who graciously choose this Perk!   


""ANTINOUS RISING"" CALLIGRAPHY ARTWORK by Owenuma - $60 - 1 availableFor more info on Owenuma, please check description above under POETRY BOOKMARKS Perk .  Owenuma created this custom piece exclusively for us.  The idea was to use the word 'Antinous', and transform it into a symbolic flowing river Nile, where our Beautiful Boy drowned.  Floating on the waves, is the Red Lotus, symbol of the blood spilled during the Lion Hunt.  This is the 'miracle flower' that was said to bloom from the blood of the defeated lion.   This red lotus flower represents the strength of the lion that has become the power of Antinous, and the potential for failures to transform and blossom into something more beautiful and more powerful.  The red lotus has also become one of the main symbols used by Antinoans to represent devotion to our God.

EGYPTIAN-STYLE CUSTOM PAINTED WOOD PANEL - 23.5"" x 13.5"" - $80 - 1 availableSame as smaller panel offered above, but more than double the heighth.  Actual wood panel is 24.5"" x 13.75"".  For options and delivery, see above description.

""OPHIOLATREIA"" LIMITED EDITION BOOK - $200 - 1 availableInformation from the Publisher HERE  This is a stunning offering, copy # 43 of a limited 200 run edition, found now  rarely for sale on line from $400 to over $900.  New artwork illuminating the original plates by Pacific North West artist Lis Wright-Ivec, real snakeskin spine binding, the cloth covers, and the beautiful red foil cover stamping make this a stunning example of book-binding art, enhancing this occult-classic (with added content to the original) on snake worship.  This is a rare chance to get this book at a very low cost, while supporting a great cause. 

ANTINO-RISKSThere are no risks of the Temple not happening, as a couple of us have already agreed to carry the full cost of all needed, even if we do not reach the full goal, and the room is already paid for.  Hence, we are doing this as a Flexible Funding goal, meaning we will take whatever you generously donate and use it towards the costs listed, and pay for the rest ourselves.However, that would be a heavy responsibility and strain on our personal finances.  Any amount we get will be helpful to offset our personal gift to Antinous and the mandate He entrusted us with.  
ANTINO-HELP!
How can YOU help?


CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUND, if you can and are called to, and be a modern-day Temple-builder.  Antinous' blessings on you and yours!

SHARE THIS FUNDRAISER on all your Social Media:  Twitter, FB, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.Each Share brings a few dollars more, and we appreciate your assistance in getting the word out.

ANTINO-THANKS!
The members of the Náos Antínoou: A Temple of Antinous thank you, and bless all of you in the name of the Beautiful Boy:  may He bring you healing dreams, peaceful days, and loving acceptance of your magnificent selves in this world of ours.In service to Antinous and the Gods, we remain truly grateful to you all.Jay & Ceinan, with Merri-Todd, Duffi, Sister Krissy, Gabriel, and Otter, and all our local PNW Temple friends.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The creation of such a trail, which has long been a goal of the Liberation Route Europe Foundation, is becoming a reality thanks to the cooperation of our international partners, notably the Dutch hiking organization, Wandelnet, and the support of other British, French, Belgian and German hiking associations. For this trail, our foundation has collaborated with the renowned architect Daniel Libeskind and <a href=""https://libeskind.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Studio Libeskind</a>, who has designed a symbolic family of markers: the ‘VECTORS’.</p>

<p>Based on historical data, the Liberation Route Europe Hiking Trail uses and connects existing long-distance hiking trails and links them together into one route. </p>
<p>The route will be recognizable through special trail markers called 'Vectors', developed in collaboration with hiking associations and architect/artist <strong>Daniel Libeskind </strong>(see below)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Regions &amp; Proposed Principal Storylines</strong></p>
<p>There are six main regions and storylines along the hiking trail following the western allies advance during the final two years of the war (1944-45):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<u>Southern England:</u>  from London to Portsmouth, where in 1944 the allies prepared for the large-scale invasion of continental Europe that became known as D-Day.</li>
<li>
<u>Northern France:</u>  from Normandy to Paris, where the D-Day landings and the subsequent Battle of Normandy were some of the most intense battles of the war.</li>
<li>
<u>Belgium:</u>  including the major cities of Mons, Brussels, and Antwerp - an important location during the crucial Battle of the Scheldt. A branch route will connect to the Ardennes, home of the infamous Battle of the Bulge during the winter of 1944-1945.</li>
<li>
<u>The Netherlands:</u>  passing through North-Brabant and Gelderland, locations of one of the largest airborne operations of the war - Operation Market Garden. A branch route will connect to the Dutch provinces of Zeeland and Limburg. </li>
<li>
<u>Western Germany</u>:  winding through the Hürtgen Forest &amp; the Rhineland, where the allies made the decisive push into Germany heading towards Berlin. </li>
<li>
<u>Berlin:</u>  the final battle of the war in Europe where the Soviet Red Army captured the city in May 1945.</li>

<p>We are proud of our partnership with renowned architect<strong> Daniel Libeskind </strong>for this project, who designed a special family of markers called the Vectors. Our aim is that within the next five years a Vector can be found at least every 5 kilometers of the trail. In total, there are<u> four types of Vectors</u> that will indicate key regions, provide directions along the trail, and detail information about places of interest.</p>
<p><u><strong>Type #1: Remembrance Site Vector</strong></u></p>

<p>In addition to the development of the physical infrastructure including the Vectors, we are striving to create robust online tools, such as a website and mobile application (4+ languages) with four different levels of content:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<u>General storyline:</u> Main introduction to a region with the necessary historical background to understand the sites along the trail.</li>
<li>
<u>Itineraries:</u> Suggested routes based on historical themes, regions, and interests including key POI's and historical locations. </li>
<li>
<u>Anchor locations:</u> POI’s or historical locations found directly on the route of the hiking trail</li>
<li>
<u>Additional POI’s and Spots:</u> Locations not on the actual route but able to be visited via a small detour.</li>
<li>
<u>Biographies:</u> Unit or personal biographies providing additional interesting information about men/women/units that were active in a specific area of the trail. </li>
</ol>
<p>We are also planning a series of physical travel guides and books to promote the hiking trail. </p>
<h3>Budget and Timeline</h3>
<p>Though we are working closely with organizations, countries, regions, and cities to “adopt” and sponsor part of the trail, a storyline, and dedicate it to a specific country, region, veteran or organization, we are seeking <strong>your support</strong> to make this route a reality. </p>
<p>Our aim is to raise the <strong>€30.000</strong> during the course of this initial crowdfunding campaign – which breaks down to<strong> </strong>€10/kilometer of the total length of the hiking trail.</p>
<p>Though our target budget for this two-year program is over €3 million, this first €30.000 will ensure that we can launch this unique project in time for the 75th anniversary celebrations of the end of WWII in May 2020.</p>
<p>The funds raised from this campaign will go towards the project development of the route, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>historical content development</li>
<li>website</li>
<li>mobile application</li>
<li>travel guides</li>
</ul>

Southern England:  from London to Portsmouth, where in 1944 the allies prepared for the large-scale invasion of continental Europe that became known as D-Day.

Northern France:  from Normandy to Paris, where the D-Day landings and the subsequent Battle of Normandy were some of the most intense battles of the war.

Belgium:  including the major cities of Mons, Brussels, and Antwerp - an important location during the crucial Battle of the Scheldt. A branch route will connect to the Ardennes, home of the infamous Battle of the Bulge during the winter of 1944-1945.

The Netherlands:  passing through North-Brabant and Gelderland, locations of one of the largest airborne operations of the war - Operation Market Garden. A branch route will connect to the Dutch provinces of Zeeland and Limburg. 

Western Germany:  winding through the Hürtgen Forest & the Rhineland, where the allies made the decisive push into Germany heading towards Berlin. 

Berlin:  the final battle of the war in Europe where the Soviet Red Army captured the city in May 1945.

The Vectors 


We are proud of our partnership with renowned architect Daniel Libeskind for this project, who designed a special family of markers called the Vectors. Our aim is that within the next five years a Vector can be found at least every 5 kilometers of the trail. In total, there are four types of Vectors that will indicate key regions, provide directions along the trail, and detail information about places of interest.
Type #1: Remembrance Site Vector

This remembrance site Vector will introduce a region and an important story line with background information along the trail. This also marks important remembrance sites along the trail. 
​Type #​2: Crossroad Vector

The crossroad Vector will be placed at crossroads around remembrance sites to point in the direction of information spots and places of interest as well as providing background information on regions and sites. 
​Type #3: Wall Vector

The wall Vector will mark important buildings denoting details of historical interest. This could be displayed at certain partners along the trail such as museums.
Type #4: Floor Vector

The floor Vector serves as a plaque marking the direction of the trail. 
​The Online Trail

In addition to the development of the physical infrastructure including the Vectors, we are striving to create robust online tools, such as a website and mobile application (4+ languages) with four different levels of content:  


General storyline: Main introduction to a region with the necessary historical background to understand the sites along the trail.

Itineraries: Suggested routes based on historical themes, regions, and interests including key POI's and historical locations. 

Anchor locations: POI’s or historical locations found directly on the route of the hiking trail

Additional POI’s and Spots: Locations not on the actual route but able to be visited via a small detour.

Biographies: Unit or personal biographies providing additional interesting information about men/women/units that were active in a specific area of the trail. 

We are also planning a series of physical travel guides and books to promote the hiking trail. 
Budget and Timeline
Though we are working closely with organizations, countries, regions, and cities to “adopt” and sponsor part of the trail, a storyline, and dedicate it to a specific country, region, veteran or organization, we are seeking your support to make this route a reality. 
Our aim is to raise the €30.000 during the course of this initial crowdfunding campaign – which breaks down to €10/kilometer of the total length of the hiking trail.
Though our target budget for this two-year program is over €3 million, this first €30.000 will ensure that we can launch this unique project in time for the 75th anniversary celebrations of the end of WWII in May 2020.
The funds raised from this campaign will go towards the project development of the route, including:

historical content development
website
mobile application
travel guides

<p>The Isle of Wight is, in spite of - or possibly as a result of its location - a place bustling with artists, writers, and musicians, in a community with many unique and often surprising facets informed by its geography and sense of displacement from the rest of the UK.<br/><br/>Wolverton Manor, in Shorwell, has long been a centre of cultural activity on the island, accommodating artists and musicians, from its concerts of world-class classical music to the annual Folk &amp; Blues Festival, fostering an atmosphere of creativity that has also seen the births of locally legendary Isle of Wight punk, avant-garde and hip-hop projects.<br/><br/>Wolverton FM, a new community arts radio station based in the grounds of The Manor, celebrates the island's creative heritage and provides a platform for experiment and expression for the Isle of Wight, through DJ radio shows, documentaries, radioplays, sound installations, field recordings, live sessions and talk radio. We aim to bring the best of international underground culture to the Isle of Wight, and bring the work of Isle of Wight artists, activists and writers to the world.</p>
<p>Since launching on October 1st Wolverton FM has featured programmes by artists from the Isle of Wight and all around the world. Regular audio treats include shows on the international songwriting underground by Pete Murphy &amp; David Graham, magical transmissions from Australia from sound-artist Jon Panther,  Isle of Wight Walks with Pauline Stirling, sound-collage and mashed-up mambo from Albuquerque's great collagist The Superfools, USA collage author Tom Comitta's ""The Nature Book"", Portsmouth's Cantando Female Voice Choir, and a feature on the island's legendary magician David Randini. </p>
<p>Our station is unusual in that we have a particular focus on radio drama, poetry and hoerspiel. Productions in the last fortnight have included an adaptation of an 1854 Punch &amp; Judy script, Rotterdam's Dr Klangendum Radio failing at Beckett's At That Fall, an Oulipo N+13 version of Shakespeare, experimental durational radioplays made from Youtube comments and Amazon reviews, and a KAOS Pad version of Kurt Schwitter's Ursonate.</p>
<p>We have also been running regular programming using experimental radio techniques to reflect on the history of the Isle of Wight, with ambient-historical radio collages about the poet David Gascoyne, Lewis Carroll's visits to Sandown Beach, Alfred Lord Tennyson, and the community that centred around Julia Margaret Cameron at Dimbola Lodge. Also coming soon is the entirety of the audio recordings of the 2016 full, continuous 12-day, 1445-person reading of the Chilcot Report at Edinburgh Fringe.</p>
<p>Wolverton FM is run by autistic and trans artists, and is developing a large body of programming dedicated to neurodiversity advocacy.

Lottie was part of the winning team of the Edinburgh Festival Panel Prize 2016 for ""Iraq out and Loud"", and is curator of the long running London avant-garde multidisciplinary arts event ""Depresstival Presents"". Also running the project is Ergo Phizmiz - an artist, radio playwright, composer and opera maker, who has a long association with the Isle of Wight. Both artists recently collaborated with the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra on their production of R. Strauss' opera ""Ariadne auf Naxos"", which received Critic's Pick in the New York Times.</p>

<p>Shoofly Liberty is one of my iconic paintings expressing the concept of liberty for all.

It is the image I will be using for the fine art prints offered in my perks for this campaign.<br/>Part of my goals for a professional studio space open to the public will be to share my passion for liberty and story telling through the arts.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a stay-at-home mom actively participating in community-based and public art projects. I am a self-taught painter with a degree in illustration. Combining these talents has enabled me to tell a story through my art.</p>
<p>When I purchase a building, if space allows, I want to offer a common area where artists can collaborate and share ideas while they work on individual projects. I would like this public space to be central to the building with my personal studio space on one side and the artist’s individual spaces wrapping around at least two sides. The collaborative workspace would also be conducive to community art classes, cultural lectures, and artists' workshops.</p>
<p>I have worked with several groups over the years on a scaled-down concept of this kind. In art groups with weekly meetings, artists worked on their current projects, reserving time at the end of each session for critiques. In this way, ideas are exchanged and personal obstacles are overcome. It is always helpful to have an outside view of your art, even if you disagree with the changes suggested. Personal growth comes from understanding other points of view.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>*I am asking for $200,000 dollars with a goal of purchasing and renovating a historic building to use as a professional studio. In addition to allowing me to expand my business as an artist, I will be able to offer more events and programs in my community.</p>
<p>*The perks for this campaign are based on an original piece of art from my studio. The original painting is 30 x 40” and is offered at the first donation of $5000 or more, up to $10,000. Perks start at $25 a digital download of the featured painting, Shoofly Liberty. Fine art prints are offered in several sizes at different investment levels and commissions are available at the $10,000 level and above.</p>
<p>*If I do not reach the full goal of $200,000, I will seek a rental property within the budget determined by money raised during this campaign. If possible, I would use this space to enact some of the community-based initiatives listed above. I would also use a physical presence in the community to continue building partnerships with local businesses. It is my hope that these goals would generate the income necessary to save for the purchase of a building or expand my marketing capabilities and run a second campaign to raise the remaining funds.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As an investor in this campaign, you will receive a signed reproduction of one of my iconic Liberty paintings. One donor will receive the original piece of art, and the highest level donors will have the opportunity to work directly with me on an original commissioned piece of art. On a personal level, full funding of this campaign will allow me to partner with other businesses and community leaders to increase cultural opportunities in our rural community.</p>
<p>This is my first crowdfunding campaign as well as my first effort to raise support for a personal goal. However, for 3 years, I have worked closely with my local Arts Council to help them raise money for community projects, hosting art shows for the local schools, and offering scholarships to students entering colleges with a focus on cultural education.</p>
<p>Art is a passion for me but I am limited by inadequate space in my home studio and an inability to meet with clients in a professional setting. Although I volunteer as much as possible in my community, having a physical presence downtown would allow me to expand my contributions there as well. It would certainly enable me to offer open studio events and coordinate with other merchants and artists to determine the next step in cultural growth in our community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My biggest challenge will be finding a building that can be purchased and renovated within the budget set by money raised during my campaign. I have already discussed my plans and looked at property with a local Realtor and a consultant in the contracting/development industries. I am aware of the challenges of bringing a historic property up to code and will not purchase one without full inspection and a reasonable understanding of the costs involved.<br/>If there are no suitable properties for purchase, I have several rental options in the same area that will allow for most or all of my goals. I have run a thorough cost analysis on the project to determine all foreseeable costs, including business licensing and permits, utilities, overhead, etc. I believe the strong work ethic that has carried me to the point of outgrowing my home studio will see me through any additional obstacles that may arise.<br/>In addition, I am confident in the support of my local community, existing patrons, and partnering businesses who have helped me through the planning stages of this campaign, including their willingness to host events to showcase my art and increase my reach within the local community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, I understand. It's a huge favor to ask. There are other ways you can help with a few minutes of your time. Please share my campaign and follow me on my web page, blog, and social media. The more you share any of these platforms with your networks, the more exposure I get, allowing me to appeal to more investors.<br/>I am already humbled by all of the support I have received from friends who have put in hours helping me shoot and edit videos, make campaign perks and incentives for people to come out to local events, and manage the daunting task of social media promotion for the campaign.</p>
<p>I am extremely grateful to local businesses who have hosted trunk shows so I can show people my art first hand and explain how I want to contribute directly to the community with this project. I will also be asking a lot of favors locally when the time comes to ship out the perks that the investors in this campaign have earned.<br/>Thank you so much for taking time to read my story and for any help you are able to give me.</p>

We are passionate about bringing together our community of residents and the season's visitors with live music and music performances. The cooler weather that keeps us from gathering at outdoor venues brings us closer together indoors at 3 local restaurants with live music at dinner time,  then a headliner on the VFW stage. These events will continue to feed and nourish us as a community and inspire our hearts with amazing soulful live music. Make a donation to help us make these events happen.

<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p> My name is Miroslav, I am 25 years old and <strong>passionate about art</strong> in its many diverse forms - drawing, calligraphy, photography, graphic design, silk screen printing, street art. I have always been driven by the need to make art, to experiment and to find new ways of applying different techniques. For the last three years, <strong>my dream</strong> has been to build a place that would allow artists to gather, work together, get motivated and expand their scope of interests.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>I’ve discovered for myself that <strong>remoteness</strong> from the fast-paced and consumerist lifestyle of the city <strong>stimulates my creative urges</strong>. And I believe that there are many other artists around the world who would benefit from having a tranquil, close-to-nature environment to use as a studio. This has been my main objective for establishing <strong>NoPoint</strong> <strong>Atelier</strong> Art Residency. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535484361/xpd7gtckq4x40x8xccvx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The NoPoint Project</strong></h3>
<p>This project has started three years ago as an idea and since then many steps on the way of making it a reality has been made. </p>
<ul>
<li>We <strong>bought</strong> the house</li>
<li>We laid a <strong>concrete floor</strong> in the atelier</li>
<li>We found <strong>professionals</strong> to create a plan for the atelier <strong>(you can see below)</strong>
</li>
<li>We <strong>renovated</strong> the common spaces - bathroom, bedrooms, living room</li>
<li>We <strong>maintained</strong> the yard and built a small garden for growing vegetables</li>
<li>
<strong>Now</strong> we're working on the kitchen</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535485182/uq313sgdkaz00x94ivcr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>All of this so far I have funded with personal finances. What is now ahead is the repair of the old barn - <strong>the future atelier</strong>. Unfortunately, it <strong>needs major renovations </strong>before it can run as a residency and welcome artists, including construction strengthening, wet and heat insulation instalment, setting up electricity and water supply, coating and painting of the walls and the roof, as well as the floor, which will need an additional coating.</p>
<p>And although I am <strong>dedicated</strong> to doing everything myself, this huge renovation requires way more than I could provide alone. That's the reason why I decided to run this Indiegogo campaign. Right now, simultaneously with it, I am organizing an <strong>exhibition in Sofia</strong>, also dedicated to the project. All the money earned from it are going to add up to this project and would be used for equipment and fundamental art supplies, such as a table, a sink, chairs, stands, lights and others. </p>
<h3>The Believers</h3>
<p><strong>Many have already believed</strong> in the idea - my parents who were very supportive and played a huge role in finding the house; my friends who are with me on this project; my graphics professor Rosen Andreev, who donated to the future art residency a <strong>lithography </strong>and <strong>etching</strong> <strong>graphics presses </strong>with all their supplementary equipment. Right now they are situated in a garage, waiting to be put to use into the atelier. His gesture gave a strong push to the project, as this equipment is a highly <strong>valued</strong> <strong>rarity</strong> in Bulgaria and holds strong potential.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535634892/kkmlsuraqfcuiehre1ht.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>All these people and their support during the last years make me confident that I am on the right path. And right now, facing this huge challenge, I need more people to believe in it and help us with <strong>the final step</strong>. All of you can help and any help would be of great importance to this project!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535485321/gobnktzdl6zohds8vaaf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>The Atelier renovation</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535634986/vbo5scdfnqyzweszyodm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The future atelier</strong> needs serious and precise repair works that we cannot do alone and without a special equipment. That's why we have already found professionals to execute the whole renovation. A freshly graduated architect with several years of experience in this field has already created a project with all the needed measurements and calculations, including <strong>a concept visualization</strong>. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535486976/lk5r6cupknjy2hi0xj3n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The total cost for the project amounts to $12,000. The funds raised during the campaign are going to be used, as it goes, for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthening of the main structure with steel - $3,900</li>
<li>New cross-beams and rafters - $1100 </li>
<li>Polymer floor coating - $1,400</li>
<li>Wet and heat roof insulation - $900</li>
<li>Window panes - $1,600</li>
<li>The needed materials for the walls (bricks, thermal insulation sheets, ground coat, paint, brushes, rollers, and other materials) - $1,200</li>
<li>Work (Setting up the woodwork of the building; thermal insulation and ground coat applying, building a wall on the west side of the building, that is now made only by wooden planks, wall putty, setting up the windows) - $1,900</li>
<li>All funds raised above this amount would add up to equipment and supplies that would allow more artist to visit and work here.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The support</h3>
<p>I fully understand the scale of this project and the <strong>amount of support</strong> needed. That's why I have put a serious thought into figuring how to say ""Thanks"" to all of you, who would decide to <strong>become part</strong> of it and <strong>donate</strong> for our campaign. As I am working on starting an art residency, I found it best to give back a personal gift of a handmade silkscreen work, that I made here in Balani village. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535636133/xrbdabldfonx8t1nn5tf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Of course, I have taken into consideration the possibility of not reaching our goal with this Indiegogo campaign. In case this happens, I would use the raised funds for the most demanding improvement: the roof.</p>
<h3>The Potential </h3>
<p>Once the atelier is ready and set, <strong>NoPoint</strong> is going to become a member of the Worldwide Network of Artist Residencies (<i><a href=""http://www.resartis.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.resartis.org</a></i>). This way, <strong>artists from all over the world</strong> would be able to find out about it and come to work here throughout the year. I am going to organize one main event with several artists, applying with portfolios, who are going to work on a specifically picked subject. The main point of this event would be <strong>to provoke artists</strong> to work with the <strong>surrounding environment </strong>(in the village, or in the town) on solving different sociology, psychology, communicational or other issues.</p>
<p>At the same time, <strong>NoPoint </strong>will stimulate a <strong>cultural exchange</strong> and mutual education between the locals and the visiting artists. While the artists can submerge in the authentic local culture, the locals will get familiar with the artists’ pieces and methodology. Gabrovo residents could observe the working process of the creators during <strong>“Open Door Days”</strong> of the atelier, open <strong>lectures</strong> and <strong>workshops</strong>. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535631276/ojmc2zdrkkarvlw4ynvi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The past winter I organised a calligraphy workshop for beginners that was visited by about 15 Gabrovo residents. All of them got involved in a collaborative process to focus on calligraphy-related problems that do not bother them in their day-to-day life. Familiarising people with the peculiarities of a creative process in a cosy, friendly environment encourages them to follow their creative impulses and build on their skills.<strong> Educational events</strong> hosted in the <strong>NoPoint</strong> <strong>Atelier</strong> can enrich the culture and aesthetic critique in certain artistic fields that can nurture <strong>long-term improvements</strong> in common visual culture.</p>

 My name is Miroslav, I am 25 years old and passionate about art in its many diverse forms - drawing, calligraphy, photography, graphic design, silk screen printing, street art. I have always been driven by the need to make art, to experiment and to find new ways of applying different techniques. For the last three years, my dream has been to build a place that would allow artists to gather, work together, get motivated and expand their scope of interests. 
I’ve discovered for myself that remoteness from the fast-paced and consumerist lifestyle of the city stimulates my creative urges. And I believe that there are many other artists around the world who would benefit from having a tranquil, close-to-nature environment to use as a studio. This has been my main objective for establishing NoPoint Atelier Art Residency. 

 
The NoPoint Project
This project has started three years ago as an idea and since then many steps on the way of making it a reality has been made. 

We bought the house
We laid a concrete floor in the atelier
We found professionals to create a plan for the atelier (you can see below)

We renovated the common spaces - bathroom, bedrooms, living room
We maintained the yard and built a small garden for growing vegetables

Now we're working on the kitchen






All of this so far I have funded with personal finances. What is now ahead is the repair of the old barn - the future atelier. Unfortunately, it needs major renovations before it can run as a residency and welcome artists, including construction strengthening, wet and heat insulation instalment, setting up electricity and water supply, coating and painting of the walls and the roof, as well as the floor, which will need an additional coating.
And although I am dedicated to doing everything myself, this huge renovation requires way more than I could provide alone. That's the reason why I decided to run this Indiegogo campaign. Right now, simultaneously with it, I am organizing an exhibition in Sofia, also dedicated to the project. All the money earned from it are going to add up to this project and would be used for equipment and fundamental art supplies, such as a table, a sink, chairs, stands, lights and others. 
The Believers
Many have already believed in the idea - my parents who were very supportive and played a huge role in finding the house; my friends who are with me on this project; my graphics professor Rosen Andreev, who donated to the future art residency a lithography and etching graphics presses with all their supplementary equipment. Right now they are situated in a garage, waiting to be put to use into the atelier. His gesture gave a strong push to the project, as this equipment is a highly valued rarity in Bulgaria and holds strong potential.

All these people and their support during the last years make me confident that I am on the right path. And right now, facing this huge challenge, I need more people to believe in it and help us with the final step. All of you can help and any help would be of great importance to this project!


 
The Atelier renovation

The future atelier needs serious and precise repair works that we cannot do alone and without a special equipment. That's why we have already found professionals to execute the whole renovation. A freshly graduated architect with several years of experience in this field has already created a project with all the needed measurements and calculations, including a concept visualization. 


The total cost for the project amounts to $12,000. The funds raised during the campaign are going to be used, as it goes, for:

Strengthening of the main structure with steel - $3,900
New cross-beams and rafters - $1100 
Polymer floor coating - $1,400
Wet and heat roof insulation - $900
Window panes - $1,600
The needed materials for the walls (bricks, thermal insulation sheets, ground coat, paint, brushes, rollers, and other materials) - $1,200
Work (Setting up the woodwork of the building; thermal insulation and ground coat applying, building a wall on the west side of the building, that is now made only by wooden planks, wall putty, setting up the windows) - $1,900
All funds raised above this amount would add up to equipment and supplies that would allow more artist to visit and work here.

The support
I fully understand the scale of this project and the amount of support needed. That's why I have put a serious thought into figuring how to say ""Thanks"" to all of you, who would decide to become part of it and donate for our campaign. As I am working on starting an art residency, I found it best to give back a personal gift of a handmade silkscreen work, that I made here in Balani village. 


 
Of course, I have taken into consideration the possibility of not reaching our goal with this Indiegogo campaign. In case this happens, I would use the raised funds for the most demanding improvement: the roof.
The Potential 
Once the atelier is ready and set, NoPoint is going to become a member of the Worldwide Network of Artist Residencies (www.resartis.org). This way, artists from all over the world would be able to find out about it and come to work here throughout the year. I am going to organize one main event with several artists, applying with portfolios, who are going to work on a specifically picked subject. The main point of this event would be to provoke artists to work with the surrounding environment (in the village, or in the town) on solving different sociology, psychology, communicational or other issues.
At the same time, NoPoint will stimulate a cultural exchange and mutual education between the locals and the visiting artists. While the artists can submerge in the authentic local culture, the locals will get familiar with the artists’ pieces and methodology. Gabrovo residents could observe the working process of the creators during “Open Door Days” of the atelier, open lectures and workshops. 

The past winter I organised a calligraphy workshop for beginners that was visited by about 15 Gabrovo residents. All of them got involved in a collaborative process to focus on calligraphy-related problems that do not bother them in their day-to-day life. Familiarising people with the peculiarities of a creative process in a cosy, friendly environment encourages them to follow their creative impulses and build on their skills. Educational events hosted in the NoPoint Atelier can enrich the culture and aesthetic critique in certain artistic fields that can nurture long-term improvements in common visual culture.

<p>By contributing to our campaign, you can help us establish this space, and support its continuation. We hope to grow it into an ongoing lecture series, which will be documented and disseminated. We want to learn from each other by crossing boundaries of knowledge and geography.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $10,000. This is going towards the purchase of a small tract of remote land, some basic improvements to it, and travel expenses for the speakers at our first residency. If we raise more, it will go towards a bigger experience. Things we'll be building on the property include: a screen for projecting films and presentations, basic amenities, an outdoor kitchen, tents (eventually we will be build several small adobe dwellings for glamping). <br/> </p>
<ul>
<li>By donating, you will be invited to attend some of our unique events over the next year in Marfa, TX, and New York City. You will be joining a unique club of artists, lecturers, scientists, chefs, musicians, and thinkers. You will get to come to one of the most remote parts of the continental USA, and camp under the stars in the high desert at a curated event with great food and stimulating conversation. </li>
<li>Being able to come to our events is the biggest perk. If you are not able to come to our preliminary event, we will be doing a residency at least every season, with longer, less intensive residencies in between. This means an initial residency from May 9th-14th, another in August, and another in the Fall, with longer, more carefree times in between when we will focus on building sustainable adobe houses on the Marfa land, and working on personal, durational art projects. A donation now can get you a discounted ticket to future events, which will increase in price. Tickets include food and shelter for 3-6 days. We'll be having large home cooked meals, with an emphasis on vegetarian food and smoked BBQ. I will be cooking meat on request as well and making my famous smoked softboiled eggs and some other delicacies. Mostly we'll be camping but there will actually be a few trailers as well with bedrooms. </li>
<li>If we do not reach our entire goal here on Indiegogo, the funds allocated will still go towards the project, which is going forward with all of our energy (and money) either way. This is a way for you to get in before we sell tickets at a higher price. You have the flexibility to choose which event you'll come and participate in. We are also working with some local sponsors, which will help offset the cost of the event.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Archaeology of the Frivolous is a celebration of art and culture outside the austere environment of a university or a detached art world conference. There will be big group meals, interactive hikes, lectures in hot springs, spontaneous cold springs, etc. You'll be living with, meeting, and interacting with people over a shared experience. <br/> </li>
<li>The ability to disconnect from your phone, laptop, work email, and other endless holes of infotainment is going to be the one of the biggest commodities of the 21st century. Come enjoy a week off, and take time for introspection and a new (ancient) kind of stimulation. </li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>Marfa, TX is a remote location, and a long travel distance for some of the guest speakers we would like to invite.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate now, you can always spread the word to people who may be interested in attending, or presenting at, an event, and to businesses that might want their products featured at our events.

<h3>“Home Movie Day is the perfect opportunity for people to connect with our past and to move the conversation about preserving our cultural heritage into the future.” — Ken Burns</h3>
<p>We are an independent group of archivists and archival enthusiasts and small formats with experience in revision, restoration, projection and promotion of analog cinema and since 2014 we have celebrated Home Movie Day.</p>
<p>So far we have used the materials and equipment that each could provide but it is necessary to equip ourselves better so that the work of reviewing films is done in a more professional way.<br/><br/>In 2013 I was Director of the Archivo Memoria Project of the National Cineteca de México and confirmed the importance of family cinema for Mexicans, promoting and presenting family films is also fundamental for the creation of new contents and that is where my personal interest is in focus.</p>
<p>This year's edition will be held at a cultural center north of the city that was founded by the government of Mexico City in an abandoned cinema, FARO Aragon. This will allow us to expand our diffusion and reach because we have the center impulse and its activities focused on the cinema and the film culture.<br/><br/>Your collaboration will help us buy materials and equipment and will make a difference in this important initiative for Mexican cinema. The help of our friends for this goal is fundamental.</p>

<p> </p> <h3>What we need and what you get</h3>
<p>We need a list of materials and equipment including Regular 8, Super 8 and 16mm leader, Super 8 and 16mm splicers, paper tape, rewinders for small gauge film, splicing tape for 8 and 16mm, Super 8 and 16mm viewers, 16mm split reels and plus. The money that we put together will be entirely destined for the purchase of these materials in the United States because it is no longer possible to obtain them in Mexico.<br/><br/>We need at least $ 4,000 but for now our goal is less because we believe it will be more feasible to put it together. Urbanski Film, Illinois, will be our main supplier and has fair prices and variety of materials that we need.<br/><br/>If you support us you will get unique rewards and the satisfaction of supporting a citizen initiative that aims to highlight the importance of home cinema in Mexico.<br/><br/>In case we do not reach the goal, the money collected will be used to buy the most urgent materials and equipment.

By helping Rock Slam, donors will receive perks and have the knowledge that they are helping a wonderful group of poets travel to Chicago in order to make strangers feel things with their words.</p>
<p>Rock Slam’s 2018 team includes Nick Yuk, Fiefie LaColla, Adam Biggs, Sean O'Reilly, and Greg Bassell. They earned spots on our team by competing in our monthly slams at Casa del Sol in Nyack, NY, and by impressing the audience at our end-of-the-season slam in late April.</p>

<p>Adam Biggs lives in Chestnut Ridge and has been writing poetry for over 14 years. This is his second time representing our area at the National Poetry Slam.

<p>Fiefie LaColla is a 19-year-old Nyack native. They've been involved with Rockland Poets for a few years, both as a performer and as an organizer.

He's a physical therapist and has been a member of Rockland Poets since it was founded as Suffern Poetry in an art gallery in Suffern back in 2011.

<p>Nick Yuk is from New Jersey. Sad. He's been a part of our poetry scene for over three years and is one of our organizers.

<p><strong>What is it</strong>: Digital Cyprus is an online platform aiming to provide all there is to know about Cyprus and its inhabitants making this the most popular site when it comes to any content request about the island. The platform’s information will be authored and edited by the public, offering the opportunity to share knowledge thus its success depends on the people who love to learn and share knowledge and have a great appreciation for the island. Digital Cyprus’ mission is to create and empower an online volunteer community who will help to gather this knowledge and make it available for everyone to read. </p>
<p><strong>Who Created it</strong>: The Digital Cyprus project is inspired and promoted by Future Worlds Center and will be eventually owned and maintained by the Digital Cyprus Foundation, a Cyprus based nonprofit organization who is currently under formation.

<p>For reasons that our beyond the purpose of this document, Cyprus has not managed to fully exploit the power of digital technologies and, except for some cases, join the digital revolution.</p>
<p>The project falls within the Europe 2020 EU's growth strategy for the coming decade, the European Commission’s Digital Agenda[1], the Onlife Manifesto[2], as well as Cyprus 2020 strategy.

<h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
<p>In 2017, we launched <i><strong><a href=""https://www.hapamag.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hapa Mag</a></strong></i>, inspired by our Editor-In-Chief’s former blog called <i>Me So Hapa</i>. </p>
<p>For many of us, it has come to represent a space for us to express our mixed racial heritage with Asian/Pacific Islander ancestry. To be Hapa is to be part of a diverse and growing community with many perspectives. In 2021, we made the decision to move to a broader future by re-naming ourselves </p>
<p><strong>MIXED ASIAN MEDIA (MAM) is a collective created by multiracial, mixed Asian/Pacific Islanders Americans (APIA's). </strong>We seek to build a community within this group through conversations of what it means to be of mixed Asian/Pacific Islander descent and find intersectionality in our search for our ever-evolving place in society.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Do</strong></h2>
<p>We provide a platform to explore pertinent experiences, build powerful relationships, and discover sought-after clarity in the mixed-Asian narrative.<strong> We believe that representation and diversity matters in all mediums.</strong> From every issue of the magazine to an annual creative festival, we strive to capture mixed Asian/Pacific Islander American (APIA) stories and experiences throughout all of our current and future mediums.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why Are We Crowdfunding?</strong></h2>
<p>Last year we were featured as one of three online magazines in the <strong>Nielsen Consumer Report</strong> on engaging Asian American consumers. Our publication has featured such notable mixed Asians as <strong>Apolo Ohno, Jessica Henwick, Midori Francis, Jason Tobin, and Andrew Koji, </strong>to name a few. We also had over <strong>1.1 million impressions from Google </strong>search results the past year.</p>
<p>We have been <u><strong>a volunteer-based organization since 2017.</strong></u> With the name change and re-brand, our hope is to be able to financially cover our business operation, including but not limited to, paying our staff and magazine writers, purchasing a password manager, and upgrading our email suite. We will also be able support our larger projects such as the Mixed Asian Media Festival in September 2021 and cover Mixed Asian Media’s photo and video production costs for the remainder of 2021.  </p>

<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>Due to COVID-19, our volunteer-based staff is still running <i>Hapa Mag</i>, but now without stable salaries from other jobs. 2020 was a year of exponential growth in terms of our readership, recognition, and business developments. We’ve been putting in extra hours to develop and strategize our business plan. We continue to work because we believe in our mission, and we believe our efforts have developed a viable product and will lead to profits and recognition as a leading mainstream mixed Asian franchise.</p>
<p>Without funding, MAM and MAM Fest will continue, but we will need to continue to rely on our volunteer staff. Our founder will have to continue to pay expenses out of pocket, and the organization will continue to be in the red for the remainder of 2021. </p>
<p>COVID-19 also affected us in a completely different aspect. The current pandemic gave rise to a strong wave of anti-Asian sentiment and blatant acts of racism. <strong>We at <i>Hapa Mag</i> soon to be MIXED ASIAN MEDIA, along with the rest of Asian American society, have worked hard to combat this, and we’ve pushed through harmful stereotypes to portray the ever-growing, diverse, Asian demographic as a positive and beautiful community. <a href=""https://stopaapihate.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#STOPAAPIHATE</a> <a href=""https://www.standwithasians.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#STANDWITHASIANS</a></strong></p>

<h3>Why Paris?</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Clive Matson, a poet who cut his literary teeth in 1960's New York City among the Beats.   In September 2017, the European Beat Scholars Network will hold their annual conference in Paris.  This group of scholars and fans of Beat literature help to promote the reading, critiquing and study of the last great American literary movement, which occurred over 50 years ago.  Today that movement has regained its relevance in an age of global crisis, when people do not trust government to solve their problems, when we are faced with the possibility of extinction of the human race, along with many other species.  Young people are turning more and more to the arts, and specifically poetry, as an expression of our dismay, our hope, our possibility of a future.</p>
<p>Paris is a significant site for this conference, not only because some of the most prominent and well-known of the Beats, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Gregory Corso, sojourned in Paris, but because it is also the city of the Climate Accord.  In Paris, in conjunction with the conference,  I will perform the World debut reading of  <i>Hello Paradise, Paradise Good-Bye</i>, my long poem on the threat to human existence posed by current world conditions.</p>
<p>In addition to myself, the EBSN Conference will host three other people with personal connections to the Beat Generation: Bonnie Bremser, memoirist of the Beat Generation, Eila Kokkinen, art editor of the Chicago Review when the Regents censored the publication of works by Burroughs, Ginsberg and Dahlberg in 1958, and Jerome Poynton, friend and excecutor of the literary estate of Herbert Huncke, progenitor of the Beats. </p>
<p>Our attempt to raise airfare, accommodations and related expenses will make possible  a direct communication with a past in America that has been neglected and suppressed.  The development of the Summer of Love in 1967, the Hippies, the protest against the Vietnam War and all subsequent war protests, human rights campaigns, the threat of species extinction and climate change, and the hope for a better world stem from the honest and authentic questioning of who we are and what is important in life, first posed by the Beats.  Now that history and that proposition formulated by the Beat authors, artists, and film makers is relevant again.  The dialogue that will occur in Paris in September will profoundly frame the issues we face today. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need approximately 20,000 dollars to do this right.  Airfare, accommodations, food and other expenses for the participants is essential.  No-one gets rich as an artist.  Be it poetry, literature, art, film, most artists barely get by while dedicating their life to their art.  Without them, what kind of world would we live in?  Today, that struggle is even worse, given the cost of housing and the other necessities of life.  The recent Ghost Ship fire in Oakland, CA, where we are based, is an example of the struggle artists face every day to survive and continue their work.  </p>
<p>In addition, we hope to create a short film on the Beats for showing in France, an after-Paris poetry tour of Germany, a possible CD of poetry readings and jazz, a form revived by the Beats in the 1950's and gaining popularity now.  But first and foremost, help us present to the Europeans some of the last survivors of the Beat Generation, with the opportunity to tell their first hand stories of a remarkable time in American letters.</p>
<p>This tour is sponsored by WordSwell, a 501(c)(3) corporation, committed to the advancement of the written word and opportunities for anyone to test their creative urges through low cost writing workshops.  All donations are tax-deductible and, where available, matching funds are provided by employers.</p>
<p>The obstacles to achieving our goals are many, but that should not stop anyone from promoting the truth, authenticity and honesty, as did the Beats in their day.  America and, indeed, the World are gravely in need of such approaches to life, as we face crises that can seem insurmountable globally.</p>
<p>There are many risks and challenges for us today, particularly in America where Federal funding for the Arts appears under threat.  We have politicians who cannot see the essential need for support for creative expression throughout our society, but the need exists nonetheless.  That includes our history as a people, and the significance of the various Bohemian art movements that created new attitudes and awareness through their exploitation of what seemed to be the outrageous.  Without those challenges to authority and conformity, we would be a poorer nation.</p>
<p>We can understand if you are unable to contribute at this time.  We only ask that you share our campaign with your friends and like-minded individuals.  Please help us, in this time of new threats to our creativity and freedom, to spread the word.  Help the Beats to, once again, share their experiences and observations in Paris and in the Greater World.  Share our Indiegogo campaign with friends!</p>
<p>For every donation over 50.00 USD you get a choice of one of the following books and videos by Clive Matson: <i>Squish Boots, The Chalcedony Songs: Books One and Two </i>or a DVD of Clive's performances with Gael Alcock, cellist.  </p>

<h3>Pourquoi nous aider?</h3>
<p>Le festival s'est toujours démarqué par son caractère non-commercial et par ses alternatives vis-à-vis l'industrie. D'ailleurs, un des piliers de sa réussite est sans contredit l'implication bénévole et collective. Le temps d'une fin de semaine, c'est des gens funky de partout dans le monde qui se réunissent pour faire du bruit et échanger. Malheureusement, tout ça coûte quand même quelque chose. Les dépenses sont minimes, mais sortent de la poche de l'organisation et nous sommes tristement pauvres ! <br/><br/>Pour nous aider, c'est vraiment très très simple et tu verras à ta droite tous les cadeaux disponibles ! En passant d'un simple coup de pouce à l'achat d'un autobus à ton nom, tout est là. Si on parvient à notre objectif, on te promet une folle édition et notre éternel respect.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3> L'impact</h3>
<p>L'an dernier, 10 000$ ont été amassés avec la vente d'alcool seulement. C'est beaucoup d'argent diriez-vous, mais il en manque encore un peu pour couvrir : l'achat de 120 caisses de bières pour votre plaisir, la tente du SHAMAN, la location de l'Auberge, l'équipement sonore, les verres réutilisables, les permis, le site web, les assurances et autres platitudes administratives. Bref, 2500$ pour nous représente ni plus ni moins que l'autonomie de l'événement. </p>

</div></div>","Pourquoi nous aider?
Le festival s'est toujours démarqué par son caractère non-commercial et par ses alternatives vis-à-vis l'industrie. D'ailleurs, un des piliers de sa réussite est sans contredit l'implication bénévole et collective. Le temps d'une fin de semaine, c'est des gens funky de partout dans le monde qui se réunissent pour faire du bruit et échanger. Malheureusement, tout ça coûte quand même quelque chose. Les dépenses sont minimes, mais sortent de la poche de l'organisation et nous sommes tristement pauvres ! Pour nous aider, c'est vraiment très très simple et tu verras à ta droite tous les cadeaux disponibles ! En passant d'un simple coup de pouce à l'achat d'un autobus à ton nom, tout est là. Si on parvient à notre objectif, on te promet une folle édition et notre éternel respect.  

 L'impact
L'an dernier, 10 000$ ont été amassés avec la vente d'alcool seulement. C'est beaucoup d'argent diriez-vous, mais il en manque encore un peu pour couvrir : l'achat de 120 caisses de bières pour votre plaisir, la tente du SHAMAN, la location de l'Auberge, l'équipement sonore, les verres réutilisables, les permis, le site web, les assurances et autres platitudes administratives. Bref, 2500$ pour nous représente ni plus ni moins que l'autonomie de l'événement.

My name is Mohamed Swaleh Ali, but most people know me by my nicknames, “Moody,” “Moodyblooz,” or “King Mohamed.” I was born here in Kenya, in the southern coastal village of Matondoni just north of Lamu on the Indian Ocean. I am currently living in Old Town Mombasa where I work as a tour guide. I also have an apartment (my friends call it “The Penthouse”) overlooking the harbor that I rent out to friends and guests who want to stay here in Old Town Mombasa while on holidays.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517874042/ulf2wllujajlw9byptil.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>My Paradise Dhow Dream</h3><p>It has been my dream, ever since I came to Mombasa and started working in the tourism industry, to own a Lamu-style dhow — a traditional sailing ship. You see hardly any traditional dhows in the old town harbor, as most of the boats here are made from fiberglass and belong to the fishermen. Although there are one or two large dhows kept by large hotels for their guests, there are no small dhows for taking locals or other tourists around Old Town harbor. Hence my dream was born — to be the first person to have a traditional dhow which would take foreign and local tourists around the harbor and parts of Mombasa Island, and showcase the beauty of the traditional coastal culture.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517874173/re2qmnyvwzpnihlfppcq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The traditional Lamu-styled dhow I want is known as a “Kasa” dhow. I opted for this choice, as it is relatively small and can be made of local materials. The dhow itself will be built by traditional craftsmen in one of the coastal villages here in Kenya. This will not only create employment for the locals, but the dhow, once completed, will serve as a model, showcasing local craftsmanship and hopefully acting as a catalyst in helping to revive the local boat-building industry. The dhow will also be crewed by local lads from the coast of Kenya.</p><h3>Paradise Dhow Budget</h3><p>The dhow will cost $20,000 to build, and another $10,000 is needed to supply the rigging, life jackets, a small motor, licensing fees, and other startup costs. After consulting with friends, crowdfunding seemed the best possibility for raising this amount, and I very much appreciate any and all contributions toward turning my dream into a reality!</p><p><strong>Our Target of $30,000 includes the following (estimated):</strong></p><ul>

This centuries-old city sits on an island in the Indian Ocean off the main shore of Kenya, and is recognized as Kenya's main tourist destination.</p><p>Mombasa was founded between the 1st and 5th century and was originally ruled by native Swahili. Its strategic position on the Indian Ocean and its very functional harbor made it an historical trading center as well as a much sought after and fought after location. Throughout its history it has been occupied by many groups, most prominently the Portuguese, Arabs, and British. The occupation of these various groups has left its mark in the richness of Mombasa's culture, and architecture especially in the Old Town section of Mombasa. Here one sees a melding of Islamic, European, and East Indian architecture and cultures with that of the original African Swahili.</p><p><a href=""http://www.museums.or.ke/fort-jesus-mombasa/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fort Jesus</a><strong> </strong>is Mombasa's most famous historical landmark and is a Unesco World Heritage treasure. Built by the Portuguese in 1593, it changed hands at least nine times between 1631 and the 1870s, finally falling under British control until Kenya's independence in 1963.</p><p>Mombasa's location on the Eastern Coastline of Kenya provides many beautiful beaches. Its historical and cultural heritage is enhanced by the beauty of these tropical beaches, both on its <a href=""http://www.cosmicsafaris.co.ke/article/mombasa-south-coast"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">South Coast</a> and its <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mombasa#/media/File:Nyali_Beach.JPG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">North Coast</a>. The warm emerald waters are inviting to both tourists and locals and have helped to make Mombasa a major center of the East African coastal tourism industry.</p><p>The main religions of Mombasa are Islam, Hindu, and Christianity, with approximately 70 percent of the inhabitants practicing the Islamic religion. Mombasa's religious diversity is reflected in its many beautiful mosques, Hindu temples, and churches. The echos from one mosque to another of the Islamic call to prayer five times a day adds a calming and magical element to this city of rich and colorful diversity.</p><p>For those who desire to experience African wildlife, the Mombasa vicinity offers <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haller_Park"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Haller Park</a> and <a href=""http://www.kws.go.ke/content/shimba-hills-national-reserve"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Simba Hills National Reserve</a>. These locations provide lush tropical vegetation and an abundance of giraffes, hippos, elephants, monkeys, antelopes, and reptiles to observe.</p><p>Historical sites, craft and spice markets, beautiful beaches, wild animals, and fascinating people: Mombasa offers something truly special for everyone who wants to experience Africa.</p><h3>Swahili: People, Religion, Language, Culture</h3><p>The word Swahili means ""coastal people."" Historically it is believed that Swahilis emerged from the coastal part of the African Great Lakes region, mainly from areas that are now Kenya and Tanzania. Swahilis originated from the Bantu peoples who settled on the East African Coast and developed agricultural and fishing communities. These coastal sites gave rise to an ever stronger and more diverse Swahili culture through sailing and trade.</p><p>Due to their advantageous coastal location, Swahilis have evolved into a very mixed stock of people who have historically been greatly influenced by foreign trade, domination, and control. Beginning in the 12th century, the strong presence of Arabs and Persians resulted in an ever increasing Islamic influence. This has continued to the extent that today the Islamic religion and traditions govern nearly every aspect of the Swahili tribes' lives, although it is generally a much more liberal version than that practiced in the Middle East.</p><p>Swahili as a language has quite a fascinating history. It also developed out of the coastal location of the original Swahilis. It was originally adapted from the African Bantu language and enriched from the Arabic, Portuguese, and Hindu languages. It became solidified as the main language of the area as it spread through East and Central Africa along the great trade caravan routes. Today it is the national language of Kenya and of Tanzania, and is spoken in more countries and by more people than any other language in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Many aspects of the <a href=""http://www.kenya-information-guide.com/swahili-tribe.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Swahili culture</a> reflect the influence of many diverse groups of people who have traded and settled in the coastal areas. Swahili cuisine has influences from India and Arabic cultures. Their main foods of fish, rice, and tropical fruits are often prepared with exotic spices. Multicultural influences can also be found in Swahili art, furniture, and architecture, although it is recognized that the original, local population were chiefly responsible for the development of the art and architecture of the Swahili coast.</p><p> </p></div>","Hello, Dear Friends!Let me first introduce myself.

With much knowledge, many years of experience, and much enthusiasm, Fadhil has signed on to take care of the business end of my dream, which could not come true without him.Meet our computer whiz Jacob Cobb. Jacob was born in Mombasa, but schooled in Nairobi. As a foster child, his dreams were built in the streets of the slum known as Kibera. After studying computer applications in college, Jacob scored a job in our local cyber café, helping those with little knowledge to submit online applications, print photos, or just read their emails. He found his purpose helping others with little technical knowledge get along on computers. Jacob is also a rap musician, having grown up with and been inspired by Kenyan Rap king, ""Octopizzo.""Our Paradise Dhow Captain, Shee Obo, was literally born and bred at sea. Shee is a jolly chap, whose friendly face, charming smile and lively personality can fool you into thinking he isn't cut out for the sea. But he is a true sea dog, born on a dhow and brought up on the island of Lamu. He started to crew on a dhow when he was just eight years old. With twenty-five years of experience of sailing under his belt, you can relax, take in the scenery, and perhaps enjoy our delightful homemade Swahili cuisine while Shee takes command of the dhow.Paradise Dhow Dream Setting: Mombasa, KenyaVisiting Mombasa is an exciting experience. This centuries-old city sits on an island in the Indian Ocean off the main shore of Kenya, and is recognized as Kenya's main tourist destination.Mombasa was founded between the 1st and 5th century and was originally ruled by native Swahili. Its strategic position on the Indian Ocean and its very functional harbor made it an historical trading center as well as a much sought after and fought after location. Throughout its history it has been occupied by many groups, most prominently the Portuguese, Arabs, and British. The occupation of these various groups has left its mark in the richness of Mombasa's culture, and architecture especially in the Old Town section of Mombasa. Here one sees a melding of Islamic, European, and East Indian architecture and cultures with that of the original African Swahili.Fort Jesus is Mombasa's most famous historical landmark and is a Unesco World Heritage treasure. Built by the Portuguese in 1593, it changed hands at least nine times between 1631 and the 1870s, finally falling under British control until Kenya's independence in 1963.Mombasa's location on the Eastern Coastline of Kenya provides many beautiful beaches. Its historical and cultural heritage is enhanced by the beauty of these tropical beaches, both on its South Coast and its North Coast. The warm emerald waters are inviting to both tourists and locals and have helped to make Mombasa a major center of the East African coastal tourism industry.The main religions of Mombasa are Islam, Hindu, and Christianity, with approximately 70 percent of the inhabitants practicing the Islamic religion. Mombasa's religious diversity is reflected in its many beautiful mosques, Hindu temples, and churches. The echos from one mosque to another of the Islamic call to prayer five times a day adds a calming and magical element to this city of rich and colorful diversity.For those who desire to experience African wildlife, the Mombasa vicinity offers Haller Park and Simba Hills National Reserve. These locations provide lush tropical vegetation and an abundance of giraffes, hippos, elephants, monkeys, antelopes, and reptiles to observe.Historical sites, craft and spice markets, beautiful beaches, wild animals, and fascinating people: Mombasa offers something truly special for everyone who wants to experience Africa.Swahili: People, Religion, Language, CultureThe word Swahili means ""coastal people."" Historically it is believed that Swahilis emerged from the coastal part of the African Great Lakes region, mainly from areas that are now Kenya and Tanzania. Swahilis originated from the Bantu peoples who settled on the East African Coast and developed agricultural and fishing communities. These coastal sites gave rise to an ever stronger and more diverse Swahili culture through sailing and trade.Due to their advantageous coastal location, Swahilis have evolved into a very mixed stock of people who have historically been greatly influenced by foreign trade, domination, and control. Beginning in the 12th century, the strong presence of Arabs and Persians resulted in an ever increasing Islamic influence. This has continued to the extent that today the Islamic religion and traditions govern nearly every aspect of the Swahili tribes' lives, although it is generally a much more liberal version than that practiced in the Middle East.Swahili as a language has quite a fascinating history. It also developed out of the coastal location of the original Swahilis. It was originally adapted from the African Bantu language and enriched from the Arabic, Portuguese, and Hindu languages. It became solidified as the main language of the area as it spread through East and Central Africa along the great trade caravan routes. Today it is the national language of Kenya and of Tanzania, and is spoken in more countries and by more people than any other language in sub-Saharan Africa.Many aspects of the Swahili culture reflect the influence of many diverse groups of people who have traded and settled in the coastal areas. Swahili cuisine has influences from India and Arabic cultures. Their main foods of fish, rice, and tropical fruits are often prepared with exotic spices. Multicultural influences can also be found in Swahili art, furniture, and architecture, although it is recognized that the original, local population were chiefly responsible for the development of the art and architecture of the Swahili coast.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our goal is to address the issues of the female world in Sub-Saharan African countries by giving women the opportunity to speak up.

<h3>You can be part of this project </h3>

<li>As you may have noticed on our website, we really believe in the value of this project, and we have launched it through self-financing. We have gotten in touch with a few Ghanaian poets, meeting them in their homes, at their workplaces, in their own communities, and willing to create a relationship. It is thanks to poetry that they let us enter their lives and those of many other women. Several topics have emerged: domestic violence, the effects of colonialism into African culture, feminism, the desire for independence, the fight against socio-cultural conventions and the rebellion against certain traditions. We are sure that, by pursuing this path, we will discover a submerged world and stories that rarely appear in the press with the actual spontaneity, the drama or the joy of those who live there. And we are sure that AfroWomenPoetry can make an accurate and original contribution to the knowledge of African women.</li>
<li>The amount of money collected will be used to cover the costs for the continuation of the project, mainly supporting travel, transport, food and accommodation costs on the spot, as well as the necessary technical equipment.

<p><strong>If you would have seen the look on my 7 year old’s face when he woke up that morning to find that he was visited at night by camels and kings and that they had left him gifts…</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Mathew and I have a son named Josiah.  He’s a pain in my butt sometimes but I adore him.  He is your typical child – always hungry, funny, energetic, and curious.  At this age, he is soaking up information (He knows every Bruno Mars song on the radio word for word) so I try to teach him as much as I can.  I want, more and more, to be able to teach him things I was taught and to pass down traditions that were passed down to me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Recently, I shared with Josiah the amazing story of the 3 Kings.  His eyes were HUGE as I told him of the adventure of the 3 Wise Men and their journey to bring gifts to baby Jesus.  I mentioned to him why the holiday is important, and how to celebrate it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So we began looking for items around the house to celebrate 3 Kings day appropriately (Mom wasn’t very happy with the mess we made).  We had so many questions.  What grass should we use?  Where would one get hay?  Where would we get a box?  Would a shoebox work? Could we color it?  Where do we put the water? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, we finally made it work.  We accomplished our 3 Kings Day offering and if you would have seen the look on my 7 year old’s face when he woke up that morning to find that he was visited at night by camels and kings and that they had left him gifts…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our mini excursion into 3 Kings Day got me thinking - this is a holiday that kids would LOVE.  Why isn’t there an all-in-one resource for this amazing holiday?  And this is where the idea for the My3KingsDay Kit was born.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’ve created a Kit that allows us to pass the traditions, share the magic, and spread the joy.  The My3KingsDay Kit is a kit that will be just for kids and offer a convenient, fun, and educational look into the wonder of Three Kings day or Dia De Los Tres Reyes.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each Kit comes with a My 3 Kings Day story Booklet, Customizable Hay Box with Activity Section, A My3Kingsday Water Bowl (FOR THE CAMELS, DUH), 45 grams of 100% Authentic Timothy Hay, 8 acrylic paint pots and paint brush.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Awesome RIGHT?!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“SO WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME?”</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m asking for your help in developing this kit.  $3,000.00 is needed to develop it from start to finish, develop the business entity, and to provide some preliminary marketing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contribution will be designated as follows:  </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>11 reasons why My3KingsDay Kit is AWESOME!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>#1 There’s nothing like it!</strong></p>
<p>No, really!  Nothing exists like this product.  Believe me! I’ve looked!  This is the only 3 Kings Day kit that is specifically catered to children.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>#2 The Joy it brings is priceless!</strong></p>
<p>Let’s be honest.  Gifts always make kids happy.  But gifts delivered to them by 3 Kings and camels?...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>#3 Build New Traditions with your loved ones.</strong></p>
<p>Children will fondly remember their 3 Kings Day the same way they remember their Christmas holiday.  It will create lasting memories that bring families closer together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>#4 It encourages, strengthens, and educates</strong></p>
<p>Growing up Christian has offered me a path of light and faith.  Early exposure to the my faith at an early age has guided me throughout my childhood and continues with me today.  Items like the My2KingsDay kit strengthens faith, educates children , and encourages them further to seek and understand our faith. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>#5 It’s another Holiday!</strong></p>
<p>Something else to celebrate!  Celebration is always great!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>#6 Cultural Identity</strong></p>
<p>As children get older or as they assimilate more and more to American ideals and values sometimes they may lose sight of who they are and where they come from.  Cultures throughout the globe celebrate 3 Kings Day differently.  Some equate the importance of 3 Kings Day with that of Christmas or Easter.  Some see it as a small reminder of our faith.  The My3KingsDay kit will offer children an opportunity to learn more of their culture and build within them a sense of belonging and identity. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>#7 Quality time with the Family</strong></p>
<p>Each kit comes with a customizable My3KingsDay kit Hay Box.  Children and families are encouraged to customize the box to their own liking.  As I sat with my own son and hand painted his box with him not only did we learn a bunch about each other, and have a blast painting together, I also finally realized that maybe I should take some art classes…I’m pretty bad at drawing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>#8 All-in-one resource for your child’s 3 Kings Day Experience</strong></p>
<p>As I educated my son about the 3 Kings or 3 Wise men he had some questions.   Nothing Google couldn’t answer of course but then I realized that I should learn a bit more about this holiday if I planned to make this a family holiday tradition.  So I educated myself and learned everything I could about the 3 Wise men.  When I was finished educating my son about this holiday I realized that we have arrived at the execution phase.  Now it’s time to make this story come to life!  Some basic items are needed in order to celebrate 3 Kings Day: A box, a bowl, and grass.  Sounds easy enough, right? WRONG!  It took forever trying to find exactly what we needed.  It even took a trip to the local big Box store (I won’t say their name here but let’s just say it rhymes with Shmarget).  A Shoebox, cereal bowl, and front lawn grass would eventually do the trick.  I thought there had to be an easier way!  NOW THERE IS!  Now I can educated my child (and future children) about this awesome story and I’d have all the items needed to celebrate it.  No trips to the store, no fumbling through Google, no emptying out closets in search for boxes, and definitely no grassless patches in my yard!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>#9 Baby Jesus</strong></p>
<p>Really…Do I have to elaborate?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>#10 $15.00 is VERY reasonable</strong></p>
<p>It starts at a great price point!  $15 is a good amount for EVERYTHING that comes within the kit.  It’s worth every cent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>#11 It makes a great gift!</strong></p>

We need an actual marketing budget to reach more of our unknown Pack around the world – from the mountains of the Andes to the lakes of (where). The reality is – without a digital advertising budget, our work is algorithmically buried. Help our Pack find us and us them!

Other Ways to Help:

Help us spread our howl by sharing Of The Wolves on your socials and with friends and family who you think could benefit from the work we are doing!
Sign up for our Monthly Newsletters! We promise we won't flood your inboxes.
Howl with us on Instagram and on our website!

Our Mission Statement:
To create stellar educational and storytelling content in various forms that innately adds value to the Pack, even if focused on life’s challenges. To normalize what already is normal but under discussed, by presenting various viewpoints and approaches. To model positive community support for our global Pack, present tangible ways to lessen our ecological footprint, and to provide our work (content, services, seminars, education and sustainably-made items) at a reasonable rate, with little to no barrier to entry.

Meet the Founders:

Lulu Brud is the wild woman behind the brand Of The Wolves. She is a part of the whole. A piece of the movement back into the wild. She finds inspiration in the quiet of the desert, sunrises/sunsets, sacred geometry, patterns and colors in nature, the lunar cycle, synchronicities, dance and movement, stillness and quiet, the mountains, the pulse of the ocean, wolves and birds, communities and tribes. Lulu is an actress (Pretty Little Liars, Ray Donovan, Entourage), artist, writer and home sanctuary maker and sustainable lifestyle promoter. She lives and loves on the east side of Los Angeles with her husband, Justin, and their little dog Paixley. Of The Wolves began in 2014 and has evolved and expanded naturally over the course of the last two to three years as a way to share stories, brands, recipes and more.
Micha Thomas is the other half, the other wild woman leading the Of The Wolves community. She’s a creative director, entrepreneur, and trained life and executive coach. Micha has carved out successful marketing, content, branding and communication initiatives for clients across culture, music, innovation and technology industries for over 13 years. She is the creator of The MiA (Made in America) Project and is certified in Executive and Organizational Coaching via Columbia University and in NLP-based life assistance and hypnotherapy. Micha has contributed stories and interviews over the years to Elle Magazine, High Snobbery, Mind Body Green, and multiple regional culture blogs…she’s lived a few places. She’s a trained dancer, alleviates angst by regular boxing sessions, and adores photography, the desert, communes, and her gaggle of pet pals.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>THIS is a really special one for us...</h3>
<p>In 2014, we set out to tour the country with The Tale of a Town.</p>
<p>Our aim: to capture the collective community memory of our Canada’s beloved main streets.</p>
<p>Since then, this husband and wife duo, has toured all 10 provinces and 3 territories, gathering stories through interviews in our storymobile (a.k.a. recording studio on wheels) - with the exception of Nunavut, where we toured by ship.  </p>
<p>These recorded stories inspired the the creation of dozens of performances developed in collaboration with local artists , and presented in storefronts across the country.</p>
<p>Oh, and also along the way, our two sons were born, and joined the ride!</p>
<p>And now, we are beyond excited to present this piece that will feature some of the thousands of voices we have recorded from coast to coast to coast during this 3 year trek across the country in this epic family adventure.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>THIS is ambitious...</h3>
<p>The Tale of a Town - Canada travels with a team of 4 artists, and features local elements in each place where it tours, including a community choir, a home grown band, and local performers.  In addition, there is customized content derived from local interviews, to ensure the audience will be able to hear their own voices inside this national tale.</p>
<p>Engaging with the local community is important to us, but in order to realize this vision, there are added expenses incurred.</p>
<p>We have received funding from The Ontario Arts Council, The Toronto Arts Council and a presentation fee from each of our theatre partners, but we still need a bit more support to keep us moving.</p>
<p><u>Your contribution will go directly to cover the following expenses:</u></p>

<p><u>The Tale of a Town - Canada</u> will offer our audiences the opportunity to hear stories from vast parts of the country alongside each other, juxtaposing voices from urban centres with those from less travelled places such as<i> Labrador City NL, Prince George BC </i>and <i>Oyster Pond NS</i>.  Songs and sounds collected from across the country accompany a range of voices like that of a <i>104 year old woman from Georgetown PEI, an elder from Churchill Manitoba, our first female mayor in Whitehorse Yukon, Acadians of Caraquet New Brunswick, and Inuit artists in from Cape Dorset Nunuvut</i>, alongside local stories. Each presentation also integrates an acknowledgement of the land, as told by indigenous elders interviewed in each place who shared their knowledge with us for inclusion in this production.</p>

<h3>EG Cohen Medal Foundation Seed Funding</h3>
<p>Hi Phil Gresley here. I am sure my grandfather (and father) would both have been so deeply proud of seeing everyone come together and enjoying themselves the other night on the rooftop.</p>
<p>Sophie, Daniel and I are very excited about the positive response you have shown us (and each other) and are energetic about progressing the ideas discussed on the night.</p>
<p>We believe that you medal winners are a bunch of like-minded people wanting to contribute something extra into our architectural world.</p>
<p>We see the EG Cohen ""foundation"" (or however we end up defining ourselves) as an <strong>exclusive </strong>group with an<strong> inclusive</strong> focus - spending energy inwards and also focused outwards to assist those in need by using our combined knowledge, experience, networks and skills.</p>
<p>We are quite unique for a group which has no obvious generational bias. This was wonderfully evident on the night. I listened to a great conversation between Tuan, one of our youngest members, and Michael one of most senior, discussing the ""fourth industrial revolution"". Super.</p>
<p>For those that were not able to attend on the night, all is not lost as there will be many more opportunities to catch-up. We also look forward to getting you on board with this exciting venture and trust you will consider throwing a few bucks into the kitty to kick things along!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What are the next steps?</h3>
<p>We have had significant interest from medallists for joining the ""board"" but will be looking for more to get involved as time goes on.</p>
<p>Right now we are specifically looking to raise $4000 from our medallist group to put towards;</p>
<p>1) researching and implementing  the most appropriate model for a  formal organization, with appropriate governance structure including a ""board"" etc.</p>
<p>2) obtaining professional assistance in identifying funding opportunities, writing grants, and ultimately obtaining  funding to allow us to embark upon a range of activities related to the unique characteristics of the award - a sprirt of unselfishness.  See below.</p>
<p>If we all pitch in (say) $50, $100, or even $200 each we can easily raise enough money to get started. Due to our wonderful spread of ""career age"", its obvious that $100 can mean much more to some than others, so lets be generous in spirit with our younger members. There is also no pressure to give.</p>
<p>Some of our initial ideas to be explored should we obtain funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mentoring / assistance / scholarships to underprivileged architectural students which might include indigenous, immigrant and other students who require help.</li>
<li>Embarking upon an education campaign about the importance of design, architecture and the built environment - to all levels of the education sector and possibly outwards into the broader public. This should also include educating students about what we actually ""do"" as architects.... We will look with a strategic focus and integrate into other possible programs / funding streams already in operation. Thanks Suzie Hunt for making us all aware of some future opportunities we may be able to explore in partnership with the AIA.</li>
<li>Providing assistance to immigrant architects who are qualified and hard working but may have trouble entering into the workplace due to language, cultural or other barriers (thanks David Hartree!)</li>
<li>The medallists could become a valuable ""resource centre"" for each other. </li>
<li>The group consists of quite a number of well respected members of our profession and there is opportunity the group to become an advocate for issues that members consider important. A different voice from that of the AIA or the ACA and one perhaps crafted to be ""thought leading"" or ""trusted advisor"".</li>
<li>At the very least an annual get together to enjoy each others company and to introduce thew new winners! This could include the winners introducing themselves by way of presentation of themselves and their journey. We hope that being awarded the EG Cohen medal is somewhat exclusive and by entering into the group will provide an opportunity for members to provide knowledge, resources, mentorship and career assistance to the winners as they embark upon their careers.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, we will have at least obtained funding to put together some catered events into the future to simply celebrate and enjoy each others company.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Please show your support!</p><p>Please also note that at this stage I have linked this campaign to an unused personal bank account. Upon the completion of the campaign this will be re-distributed into an appropriate account relating to the structure of the organisation.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","EG Cohen Medal Foundation Seed Funding

2) obtaining professional assistance in identifying funding opportunities, writing grants, and ultimately obtaining  funding to allow us to embark upon a range of activities related to the unique characteristics of the award - a sprirt of unselfishness.  See below.
If we all pitch in (say) $50, $100, or even $200 each we can easily raise enough money to get started. Due to our wonderful spread of ""career age"", its obvious that $100 can mean much more to some than others, so lets be generous in spirit with our younger members. There is also no pressure to give.
Some of our initial ideas to be explored should we obtain funding:

Mentoring / assistance / scholarships to underprivileged architectural students which might include indigenous, immigrant and other students who require help.
Embarking upon an education campaign about the importance of design, architecture and the built environment - to all levels of the education sector and possibly outwards into the broader public. This should also include educating students about what we actually ""do"" as architects.... We will look with a strategic focus and integrate into other possible programs / funding streams already in operation. Thanks Suzie Hunt for making us all aware of some future opportunities we may be able to explore in partnership with the AIA.
Providing assistance to immigrant architects who are qualified and hard working but may have trouble entering into the workplace due to language, cultural or other barriers (thanks David Hartree!)
The medallists could become a valuable ""resource centre"" for each other. 
The group consists of quite a number of well respected members of our profession and there is opportunity the group to become an advocate for issues that members consider important. A different voice from that of the AIA or the ACA and one perhaps crafted to be ""thought leading"" or ""trusted advisor"".
At the very least an annual get together to enjoy each others company and to introduce thew new winners! This could include the winners introducing themselves by way of presentation of themselves and their journey. We hope that being awarded the EG Cohen medal is somewhat exclusive and by entering into the group will provide an opportunity for members to provide knowledge, resources, mentorship and career assistance to the winners as they embark upon their careers.
If we don't reach our goal, we will have at least obtained funding to put together some catered events into the future to simply celebrate and enjoy each others company.

Please show your support!Please also note that at this stage I have linked this campaign to an unused personal bank account. Upon the completion of the campaign this will be re-distributed into an appropriate account relating to the structure of the organisation.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Founded by a Royal Academy of Music violin graduate, Lycaeum Music sought to fill in the gaps created by the cuts to the musical education provision in the UK. </p>
<p>Music On Wheels is to be our flagship program for delivering music lessons, workshops, and concerts to some of the children that would otherwise never have the chance to experience them.</p>
<p>Lycaeum will contribute with £1800 toward this project every school month of 2019 and, with your help, we estimate that we will be able to introduce to music and teach over 8000 children in 2019. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need £15.000 to get the project going which will be used as:</p>
<ul>
<li>£7000 for purchasing a 2nd hand bus</li>
<li>£3000 for refurbishing it</li>
<li>£3000 for purchasing the instruments onboard</li>
<li>£2000 for the initial running costs</li>
</ul>
<p>For your contribution you will get various rewards ranging from a personalised 'thank you' letter and free passes to our events, to an entire day out on a picnic with the bus or having parts of the vehicle named after you.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Playing music has been scientifically proven over and over again to be an invaluable and wholesome way for a children to develop their cognitive capabilities, as well as their artistic ones. </p>
<p>You might have heard that 'love is the universal language of mankind' but music surely comes as a very close 2nd, with the same 12 different notes of the octave being understood across continents and cultures.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make this more accessible and affordable for as many children and adults as possible.</p>
<p>At Lycaeum we have so far taught 250 students privately in 2018, and have engaged with around 400 more through various community projects at Angel Central, St Pancras International, and at the Royal Academy of Music. With your help we can do so much more!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>So far we have overcome a number of challenges such as finding the bus to purchase and the people to operate it, as well as the tutors that will be giving lessons on it. </p>
<p>Many more are yet to be overcome, such as permanent parking, security, refurbishment, and the instrument purchase, as well as securing possible deals with councils and businesses to cover the operational costs.</p>
<p>We are currently in talks with a number of private and public entities that have showed interest in supporting the project, and are confident that all the challenges will be overcome by February 2019. </p>
<p>If we do not manage to get the full amount funded, we will be using the available funds to deliver comparable community projects without a vehicle.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>For those of us who can't quite afford to help us with a contribution, no worries at all!</p>
<p>If you believe this project will have a positive impact for the UK's children, please help us spread the word about the campaign! </p>
<p>You can share it on social media or simply tell some friends about it.</p>
<p>Help us keep the music playing where it is needed most!</p>

<p><strong>Join the Story, our collective story,</strong> by helping us a build an underground chapel from granite that will exist for 3000 years - <i>at least</i>. Ebenezer Chapel will use leading-edge innovations in architecture &amp; design, engineering, acoustics and sustainability practices to hew a chapel underneath the earth that will become a place of prayer, meditation and hope for people from around the world.</p>
<p>Visitors will enjoy the lovely 6 acre park and then can then enter the chapel and begin the descent to the sanctuary. As you slowly walk the concourse, you'll be surrounded by natural light, raw granite and corten steel (see the perks about having your name engraved) until you are finally in the quiet of the chapel. Natural light will enter from a skylight and the walls will hold artwork representing Christianity and faith.</p>
<p>The sanctuary itself will hold up to 250 people and be a perfect place for weddings, large church groups, special events or just a place of rest for solitary travelers hoping to sit quietly in contemplation and peace.<br/><br/><strong><a href=""https://vimeo.com/184004825"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TAKE THE ANIMATED VIDEO TOUR.</a></strong></p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>... is as multi-layered as the granite itself. For starters, public places dedicated to faith are more important than ever.

<h3>Positivity Through Dance</h3>
<p>Slum Dance Africa is a project that started in 2015 by B-Boy Vick in Kibera, Nairobi. The aim was to engage the children and youth in the surrounding community with something positive that brings joy and keeps them active and away from trouble. From one small community hall in the heart of Kibera Slum Dance Africa has now grown to be a continent wide movement that brings dance and opportunities to urban areas around Africa. Slum Dance Africa continues to have several local projects that are training children and young people in dance and arts in Kibera and thus also providing employment for young artist involved in the Slum Dance Africa staff.</p>
<p>The biggest project of Slum Dance Africa is the international dance competition tour taking place annually. This year the tour will go through Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Congo and Burundi collecting the most talented break dancers around to participate to a one week dance camp and final battle in Nairobi in December 2019.</p>
<p>Slum Dance Africa goes around each country with qualification events and the 2 finalists of 1vs1 and the best 3vs3 crew will win a money prize and a fully covered travel to Nairobi for the Final week. All dancers, no matter their origin, gender, age, education or economical status are eligible to participate and compete to win.</p>
<p>Providing young dancers opportunities is step by step making dance, arts and culture more appreciated in their communities. Slum Dance Africa is offering a platform and stage for the young dancers to showcase their skills and acknowledges the hard work they are putting in to making it to the top.</p>
<p>The team of Slum Dance Africa consist of people passionate about dance, art and making a change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>B-Boy Vick - The Creator, The Boss and the Heart of Everything</p>
<p>Edwin Mokaya - The Artistic All-over Organizer and International Guest Coordinator </p>
<p>B-Boy Rodger - The Leading Trainer &amp; ""On the Ground"" Project Coordinator </p>
<p>Mustapha ""Moose"" Haji - The Visual and Technical Genius behind the screen</p>
<p>Don Wilson Odhiambo - The Guy behind the awesome pictures</p>
<p>Oscar Human - The Manager and Trusted Advisor</p>
<p>Saara Saturo - Assistant Producer and Crowdfunding Coordinator</p>
<p>Grace Atieno - The Secretary keeping us all organised</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Food, Beds and Bus tickets please!</h3>
<p>With this campaign we are looking assistance to cover the remaining 30% of the costs that are yet missing funding.  Each year Slum Dance Africa has gotten bigger and better. Meaning that this year the Final Week in December 2019 will consist almost 40 dancers from 6 different countries.</p>
<p>Transporting all these dancers from their homes to Nairobi and back will be about 2000 USD (approximately 25-50USD/bus ticket/person depending on the country of origin)</p>
<p>Providing everyone a place to sleep for 7 nights will be about 4000 USD (approximately 15 USD/person/night)</p>
<p>Giving everyone three meals a day and water to drink during practices will be about 2500 USD (approximately 9 USD/person/day)</p>
<p>So in total we are looking to collect 8500 USD through this campaign to help transport, feed and accommodate the young dancers traveling for the Final Week. We are hoping to reach our goal with this campaign and thus ensure all dancers are able to participate and be comfortable in where they stay and how they eat. In case we remain under our goal, the dancers will share beds and only eat once a day! ;)  Or... we will find a way to work with what we have the best way we can, like we always do!</p>
<p>We have already secured a budget for costs relating to all six country qualifications (travel, accommodation, event organizing, money prizes) as well as the event organizing costs of the final week dance camp and battle (venue and equipment rent, prize money, guest artist facilitation, technique and marketing). We are happy to work with valuable partners and sponsors who share our vision and enthusiasm and are making the project come alive. With your help we will make it fly!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Slum Dance Africa is making a difference?</h3>
<p>""Before I left home to Nairobi, my mom told me that I better win and come back with that prize money or otherwise I should<br/>just stay wherever I am and find work. Am so happy to go home now and tell her dance is actually paying our rent now."" - The winner of 1vs1 battle 2018 from Tanzania</p>
<p>""Slum Dance Africa is just simply about making kids and young people smile and happy by dancing!"" - B-Boy Vick, The Founder</p>
<p>""I want to thank all of you as we have been together here as family, though even tomorrow we are going to start our journeys after the battle we stay together and we are together."" - Participant from Rwanda</p>
<p>""Slum Dance Africa is the most commendable youth program that spreads positivity among the youth in the slum"" - One of the previous year sponsors, Member of Parliament Mr. Ken Okoth</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Overcoming all the obstacles!</h3>
<p>The team of Slum Dance Africa is quite used to overcoming obstacles. Throughout the years many things have come on our way and we always overcome one way or another!</p>
<p>As cliché as it may sound ""This is Africa"" meaning, things do happen. And even more of a cliche ""Hakuna Matata"" meaning in Swahili no worries. No matter if it is a bus breaking down, immigration trouble, unexpected costs occurring, technique failing, power black outs, internet not working, flights delayed, schedules failing because of traffic jams we have done it all and know that there is no situation our team cannot handle with smooth and style!</p>

Slum Dance Africa is a project that started in 2015 by B-Boy Vick in Kibera, Nairobi. The aim was to engage the children and youth in the surrounding community with something positive that brings joy and keeps them active and away from trouble. From one small community hall in the heart of Kibera Slum Dance Africa has now grown to be a continent wide movement that brings dance and opportunities to urban areas around Africa. Slum Dance Africa continues to have several local projects that are training children and young people in dance and arts in Kibera and thus also providing employment for young artist involved in the Slum Dance Africa staff.
The biggest project of Slum Dance Africa is the international dance competition tour taking place annually. This year the tour will go through Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Congo and Burundi collecting the most talented break dancers around to participate to a one week dance camp and final battle in Nairobi in December 2019.
Slum Dance Africa goes around each country with qualification events and the 2 finalists of 1vs1 and the best 3vs3 crew will win a money prize and a fully covered travel to Nairobi for the Final week. All dancers, no matter their origin, gender, age, education or economical status are eligible to participate and compete to win.
Providing young dancers opportunities is step by step making dance, arts and culture more appreciated in their communities. Slum Dance Africa is offering a platform and stage for the young dancers to showcase their skills and acknowledges the hard work they are putting in to making it to the top.
The team of Slum Dance Africa consist of people passionate about dance, art and making a change.
 
B-Boy Vick - The Creator, The Boss and the Heart of Everything
Edwin Mokaya - The Artistic All-over Organizer and International Guest Coordinator 
B-Boy Rodger - The Leading Trainer & ""On the Ground"" Project Coordinator 
Mustapha ""Moose"" Haji - The Visual and Technical Genius behind the screen
Don Wilson Odhiambo - The Guy behind the awesome pictures
Oscar Human - The Manager and Trusted Advisor
Saara Saturo - Assistant Producer and Crowdfunding Coordinator
Grace Atieno - The Secretary keeping us all organised
 

Food, Beds and Bus tickets please!
With this campaign we are looking assistance to cover the remaining 30% of the costs that are yet missing funding.  Each year Slum Dance Africa has gotten bigger and better. Meaning that this year the Final Week in December 2019 will consist almost 40 dancers from 6 different countries.
Transporting all these dancers from their homes to Nairobi and back will be about 2000 USD (approximately 25-50USD/bus ticket/person depending on the country of origin)
Providing everyone a place to sleep for 7 nights will be about 4000 USD (approximately 15 USD/person/night)
Giving everyone three meals a day and water to drink during practices will be about 2500 USD (approximately 9 USD/person/day)
So in total we are looking to collect 8500 USD through this campaign to help transport, feed and accommodate the young dancers traveling for the Final Week. We are hoping to reach our goal with this campaign and thus ensure all dancers are able to participate and be comfortable in where they stay and how they eat. In case we remain under our goal, the dancers will share beds and only eat once a day! ;)  Or... we will find a way to work with what we have the best way we can, like we always do!
We have already secured a budget for costs relating to all six country qualifications (travel, accommodation, event organizing, money prizes) as well as the event organizing costs of the final week dance camp and battle (venue and equipment rent, prize money, guest artist facilitation, technique and marketing). We are happy to work with valuable partners and sponsors who share our vision and enthusiasm and are making the project come alive. With your help we will make it fly!
 

Why Slum Dance Africa is making a difference?
""Before I left home to Nairobi, my mom told me that I better win and come back with that prize money or otherwise I shouldjust stay wherever I am and find work. Am so happy to go home now and tell her dance is actually paying our rent now."" - The winner of 1vs1 battle 2018 from Tanzania
""Slum Dance Africa is just simply about making kids and young people smile and happy by dancing!"" - B-Boy Vick, The Founder
""I want to thank all of you as we have been together here as family, though even tomorrow we are going to start our journeys after the battle we stay together and we are together."" - Participant from Rwanda
""Slum Dance Africa is the most commendable youth program that spreads positivity among the youth in the slum"" - One of the previous year sponsors, Member of Parliament Mr. Ken Okoth

 
Overcoming all the obstacles!
The team of Slum Dance Africa is quite used to overcoming obstacles. Throughout the years many things have come on our way and we always overcome one way or another!
As cliché as it may sound ""This is Africa"" meaning, things do happen. And even more of a cliche ""Hakuna Matata"" meaning in Swahili no worries. No matter if it is a bus breaking down, immigration trouble, unexpected costs occurring, technique failing, power black outs, internet not working, flights delayed, schedules failing because of traffic jams we have done it all and know that there is no situation our team cannot handle with smooth and style!

<h3><strong>WHAT AM I RAISING MONEY FOR? </strong></h3>
<p>In this first round of fundraising, I am seeking support for the first nuAfrica micro-festival to be held in New York City in the Summer of 2020. The single day event will be a micro music concert x conference experience celebrating African creative contributions with a curated crowd of diverse industry professionals, investors, brands, artists and fans. The event will feature a panel discussion, live music from African acts from the continent and the diaspora, and community building workshops for the establishment of cross-continental connections and collaborative projects. </p>
<p>Money raised from Indiegogo backers in the first round will go towards securing an event venue and creating marketing content for the event. Subsequent rounds of fundraising will fund the international travel of African music artists. With additional brand sponsorships and producer investments, I will fund collaborative projects for the event. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHY? </h3>
<p>With the recent global mainstreaming of African sounds, aesthetics, and cultures, there is substantial demand for embracing shared African heritage through the exploration of music. Africa is known for being rich in creative innovation and talent, and everybody wants in on the zeitgeist. Yet lasting legacies of colonialism and neocolonialism have limited Africa’s ability to compete in global trade markets, systematically excluding African artists from the global creative economy and its lucrative music industry. </p>
<p>It’s time to disrupt this system towards African economic development. Creativity as a commodity can dictate where global capital flows. Multiple studies have shown that creative industries are key catalysts for income generation, job creation, increased export earnings, foreign exchange and investment, and the growth of leisure and tourism industries. These are important factors for a continent still reeling from its peripheral position in the global economy. Furthermore, Leveraging U.S.resources and infrastructure for African development is a radical subversion of traditionally exploitative world systems.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>NEXT STEPS</h3>
<p>Although nuAfrica will host an annual event, the firm’s core activities will be to advocate for and consult on the creation of collaborative projects between multiple stakeholders. After the event, I will continue to build new relationships and leverage existing ones, seeking further investment for projects and programs that advance the interests and platforms for African artists in New York City and around the world. The long term vision is to create high-level interventions that can impact infrastructure on the continent and increase Africa’s share of the global creative economy.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ABOUT ME </h3>
<p>My name is Sibabalwe Mona and I am a social enterprise strategist living in New York City. I am driven by my passion for African socio-economic justice and development, and inspired by the creative contributions and cultural impact of Africans globally. </p>
<p>Born and raised in South Africa, I hold Bachelor of Arts and BA Honours degrees in International Relations from the University of Cape Town, and a Master of Arts in International Affairs from The New School.

<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES </h3>
<p>Funding &amp; Access: African artists lament the barriers that keep them from their audiences abroad, including financial resources for travel and visa limitations. If I am unable to raise enough capital in subsequent fundraising rounds, the event’s musical programming will be compromised.</p>
<p>Collaborators: This event relies on cultivating relationships with multiple stakeholders across public and private sectors and creating community towards a shared goal. If no one believes in the impact potential of nuAfrica’s mission, the event may suffer.</p>

<p><strong>Wer ist fairMATCHING und was machen wir?</strong></p>
<p>fairMATCHING ist ein Verein aus 5 Menschen, der seit rund einem Jahr Arbeit suchende Flüchtlinge und Unternehmen gezielt vernetzt. Durch unsere Begleitung sollen engagierte Unternehmen unterstützt und Geflüchtete nachhaltig integriert werden.</p>
<p>Viele Geflüchtete bringen hohes Potential, Know how und vor allem großen Ehrgeiz mit. Sie haben ein Ziel vor Augen, das sie in ihrer neuen Heimat erreichen wollen. Weil die Ressourcen fehlen, um diese Menschen individuell zu betreuen, können öffentliche Arbeitsvermittlungsangebote oft keine Rücksicht auf die Kompetenzen und Wünsche der Bewerber nehmen. Dadurch wird Arbeit als Integrationsmotor abgewürgt und aus Motivation wird Frustration.</p>
<p><strong>Wieso diese Kampagne?</strong></p>
<p>Wir wollen unsere Arbeit weiterführen und unsere Strukturen professionalisieren, um noch zielgenauer arbeiten zu können. Auch nach einem Jahr ehrenamtlicher Arbeit haben wir aus öffentlicher Hand noch keine Unterstützung erhalten. Daher ist das Überleben von fairMATCHING nun von dieser Kampagne abhängig<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Was haben wir mit dem Geld vor?</strong></p>
<p>Mit 89.000 Euro könnten wir mindestens ein Jahr weiterarbeiten – da uns jede/r Einzelne und das individuelle Arbeiten und nicht die Masse an Vermittlungen wichtig ist, geben wir ungern „Erfolgsprognosen“. Aber vor dem Hintergrund der Learnings des letzten Jahres, dem Netzwerk, das wir bereits aufgebaut haben und die Bekanntheit, die fairMATCHING in Salzburg schon erreicht hat, gehen wir davon aus, mit 2 Fixangestellten im kommenden Jahr rund 40 Bewerber langfristig vermitteln zu können</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Was bekommt ihr von uns?</strong></p>
<p>In unserer bisherigen Arbeit haben wir jeden Helfer, Unterstützer und positiven Einfluss gerne und berechtigt extra hervorgehoben. Wir möchten, dass die Welt von jedem einzelnen Unterstützer dieser Kampagne erfährt und haben uns dafür ganz besondere Perks überlegt. </p>
<p><strong>Und wenn wir das Ziel nicht erreichen?</strong></p>
<p>Wir werden jeden Euro in die Arbeit von fairMATCHING stecken und sind für unsere motivieren und qualifizierten Bewerber froh um jeden Tag, an dem wir sie unterstützen können. Auch wenn das Funding-Ziel nicht erreicht wird, arbeiten wir mit der Summe, die wir bekommen, so lange wie möglich weiter. </p>
<p><strong>Wieso ist unsere Arbeit so wichtig?</strong></p>
<p>Unsere Wirtschaft, aber auch unsere Gesellschaft stehen vor einer enormen Integrationsherausforderung, die wir mit fairMATCHING angenommen haben! Mit einer Unterstützung übernehmt auch Ihr Verantwortung und ermöglicht eine nachhaltige Integration unserer neuen Mitbürger. Lasst uns gemeinsam dazu beitragen, dass die positiven Beispiele unüberhörbar werden.​<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Wie kann unsere Arbeit helfen?</strong></p>
<p>Um zu vermeiden, dass das Potenzial, die Ziele und Wünsche der Arbeit suchenden Flüchtlinge untergehen, ist eine individuelle Betreuung unumgänglich. Das ist natürlich zeit und personal-intensiv. Unsere Arbeit im letzten Jahr hat uns aber gezeigt, dass genau so die schönsten Erfolge erzielt werden und beide Seiten gleich von dem MATCHING profitieren.</p>
<p>Wir wollen in Zukunft noch mehr Kontakt zu fairen Unternehmen pflegen und unser Netzwerk sinnvoll einsetzen. Auch im Sinne der Bewusstseinsbildung, dass Diversität etwas Positives ist, das viel kreatives Potenzial freisetzen kann. Gelungene MATCHING-Beispiele sind die Motoren für eine solche Entwicklung</p>

We have been able to stick to our vision of presenting strong original music on a daily basis - regardless of genre, current popularity or even common sense. We are proud to continue to be the incubator to countless new projects and our sole wish is to keep doing so for many years to come. </p><p>Times they have a-changed, however. Surviving as a small business in this new, re-branded Brooklyn has become a sometimes insurmountable challenge. The overall price of doing business has increased tremendously (higher rent, increase in the cost of goods, services, permits, insurance etc.. ) and we have accumulated a debt that our dwindling profit margin has made nearly impossible to manage: $50,000 owed to our bank and  $20,000  owed to our landlord – most of it for city services related costs that, over the past few years, have spiraled out of control.</p><p>Our landlord had thus far been understanding, but as the city has now placed a lien on his building, we are faced with a hard deadline: pay $20,000 by July 1st.</p><p>Our credit line has reached its ceiling and our personal credit doesn’t allow us to borrow any more. Barbès has no assets - our only assets are the musicians who have chosen Barbès as a creative home, and the Barbès audience that comes and supports them.    </p><p>So, we turn to you. Raising the full $70,000 we owe would insure that we stay in business for at least another five years - when our second lease ends. In this current economic and political climate, five years feels reasonably close to an eternity. Having a sounder financial base might even enable us continue longer, but we are still a few bridges away from that particular crossing.<br/>Short of that goal - which we do understand might be overly ambitious - we do need to find $20,000 before July 1st...

We have been able to stick to our vision of presenting strong original music on a daily basis - regardless of genre, current popularity or even common sense. We are proud to continue to be the incubator to countless new projects and our sole wish is to keep doing so for many years to come. Times they have a-changed, however. Surviving as a small business in this new, re-branded Brooklyn has become a sometimes insurmountable challenge. The overall price of doing business has increased tremendously (higher rent, increase in the cost of goods, services, permits, insurance etc.. ) and we have accumulated a debt that our dwindling profit margin has made nearly impossible to manage: $50,000 owed to our bank and  $20,000  owed to our landlord – most of it for city services related costs that, over the past few years, have spiraled out of control.Our landlord had thus far been understanding, but as the city has now placed a lien on his building, we are faced with a hard deadline: pay $20,000 by July 1st.Our credit line has reached its ceiling and our personal credit doesn’t allow us to borrow any more. Barbès has no assets - our only assets are the musicians who have chosen Barbès as a creative home, and the Barbès audience that comes and supports them.    So, we turn to you. Raising the full $70,000 we owe would insure that we stay in business for at least another five years - when our second lease ends. In this current economic and political climate, five years feels reasonably close to an eternity. Having a sounder financial base might even enable us continue longer, but we are still a few bridges away from that particular crossing.Short of that goal - which we do understand might be overly ambitious - we do need to find $20,000 before July 1st... Every bit will help..Of course, you’re probably asking yourself why you should help. It’s a fair question, and we may not have a good answer.  We do think that we’ve built a place that is different from any other - and that what we are adding to the Brooklyn cultural landscape is worth preserving.  On the other hand, times are indeed changing: we may have ceased to be relevant and may deserve the slow death that seems to be awaiting us.We hope not. In any case, we do believe that for the past fifteen years, Barbès has played host to a vibrant community and acted as a laboratory for all kinds of new music.

<h3>What is the San Juan Drama Company?</h3>
<p>¡Hola! The San Juan Drama Company, since 2010, has been home to hundreds of youth with the aspiration to become performing artists. Some of our young actors live in public housing developments while others come from middle class homes. This keeps them away from the streets, drugs and violence as well as uniting them in what they all have in common - their passion for the arts! </p>
<p>During the last 5 years, we have produced over 20 theatre productions and have been able to work in different community service projects. Now we would like to expand our creative energies into television and film! </p>
<p>That is why we will be taking 20 of our most talented youth to Mexico City for an intensive ""acting for the camera"" workshop in the exclusive M&amp;M Studio (<a href=""http://www.patriciareyesspindola.com)%C2%A0from"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.patriciareyesspindola.com)</a> from July 16th till the 31st, 2017. </p>
<p>We are currently facing Puerto Rico's largest economic crisis in its history but are working very hard so that this political situation will not affect our youth's dreams and goals.  </p>
<p>For example, our final fund-raiser will be in a few weeks. It will be our presentation of the musical ""The Addams Family"". It will be held at the majestic Teatro Tapia in Old San Juan on the 7th, 8th and 9th of July.  With the money remaining after production expenses,  we are aiming to  cover the tuition, some airfare tickets and hotel expenses for those most in need. </p>

<ul>
<li>Our goal for this campaign is $2,800. This will cover dinner expenses for the trip. This works out to $10 per person, per night for 15 nights. </li>
<li>Once we reach our goal, the excess will allow us to add a cultural field trip and attend some of the awesome theatre productions that are currently being presented in the city.</li>

As a queer Chinese-Vietnamese American, growing up, I felt pretty isolated and unsure of who I was, as part of the LGBTQ+ community and growing up as part of multiple cultures. Maya Reddy states in the Mission Statement of the Gaysian Project, “When we are not seen, we are not known. That sense of loneliness is overpowering. Rarely are all Asian ethnicities recognized. And just as rarely are all identities of queerness celebrated, especially within Asian American representation.”  Representation is just a small part of this event—it’s about creating and fostering community.</p><p> As a writer, I seek to tell stories that not only entertain but also inspire others and show inclusive characters who reflect the world we live in. In 2017, I curated the first iteration of this event in partnership with the Chinese American Museum, and was overwhelmed by the amount of amazing people who turned up for what I thought would be a modest reading and panel. Instead, the CAM courtyard overflowed with community and people who came together to see our performers, explore the exhibits and participate in a lively discussion. This year, with your support, I’m hoping to create a unique and enriching experience for the community, working with the Chinese American Museum and the Gaysian Project to encourage people to explore the amazing exhibits at the museum and also participate in an evening of discussion.</p><h3><strong>2018: CELEBRATING THE ASIAN AMERICAN LGBTQ+ EXPERIENCE</strong></h3><p>CELEBRATING THE ASIAN AMERICAN LGBTQ+ EXPERIENCE brings together queer identified artists, musicians, and writers in historic downtown Los Angeles at the Chinese American Museum for Lambda Literary’s LitFest 2018.

While many industries were able to continue to function in some capacity during shutdown these pillars within our culture are undoubtedly one of the hardest hit from this global crisis. Ireland is a nation of artists and a land bursting with culture that has brought the world the likes of: <i>Riverdance</i>, Enya, Oscar Wilde, Niall Horan, Pierce Brosnan, Saoirse Ronan, Cillian Murphy, Bono and Liam Neeson. Not to mention the added plethora of talent that has stemmed from the Irish Diaspora thereafter. The list goes on and on, but what it proves is how influential and deeply embedded Irish art and culture are in global society even amongst people who aren’t Irish. In fact, <strong>St. Patrick’s Day</strong> is the only national holiday that is celebrated throughout the entire world!</p><p>My mother, Shannon Kincaid, is a Fine Artist and I, myself, am a former dancer with <strong><i>Riverdance</i></strong> and an entrepreneur who is passionate about Ireland. Together, we have collaborated to create a new series of paintings depicting the various pillars of Irish culture and we are offering prints of them with <strong>100% of the profits</strong> going directly to support:</p><ul>
<li>Irish musicians, singers and performers</li>
<li>Irish dancing schools, clubs and professional dancers</li>
<li>Actors, writers and artists</li>
<li>Festivals and concerts</li>
<li>Theatres and event/cultural spaces</li>
<li>Crews &amp; other essential backstage workers</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><strong>All of these various people, groups and institutions</strong> have experienced extreme financial hardships after the past several months. Built up rents on studio/rehearsal spaces, cancelled tours and performance runs with no end in sight, pubs and other cultural hubs closed could potentially cripple these industries in a way that they might never recover. It’s also highly likely that funding for upcoming and new projects will suffer. While debunked, it was long rumoured that During WWII Winston Churchill was asked to cut funding for the arts to which he replied, “then what are we fighting for?”  He was quoted, however, saying ““The arts are essential to any complete national life. The State owes it to itself to sus­tain and encour­age them…. Ill fares the race which fails to salute the arts with the rev­er­ence and delight which are their due.” As we fight this current war against the novel coronavirus it feels very fitting to try and use art to help save the entire culture and industry within the arts.</p><p>While some would argue that these industries and these areas are nonessential, I would argue the exact opposite. However, I understand the difference between charitable donations to the healthcare system and frontline workers, which is why we are not asking for people’s charity without giving them the option to get something in return. While, there is the option to donate simply out of charity, donations of <strong>$25+</strong> will allow people to choose a piece of art that resonates most with them. <strong>This collection of art illustrates the greatest parts of Irish culture: music, dance, literature, mythology, festivals and pub culture. We want to make art that celebrates the very best of Irish culture and make accessible to everyone who identifies with it. This is a means of uniting the global Irish community together under a common cause to ensure Irish culture thrives in the times ahead.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593452805/a71miyeusobw2xlixjuo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Shannon in her studio</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Art of Irish Culture Collection:</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593453800/olqkmc6xlrj5dzrrt7nl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong><u>The Dancer:</u></strong></p><p>Irish people’s love of dancing has been well documented throughout their written history. In fact, one of the earliest references to dancing details a visit between the Mayor of Waterford and Mayor of Baltimore in 1413. The modern Irish dancing of today is no longer merely a processional combination of singing and dancing as an act of celebrating, but a sport that produces athletes that are physically strong, as well as creative and artistic. What was once a tradition specific to Ireland (as well as England, Scotland, and some parts of America) caught like wildfire in 1994 with the debut of <i>Riverdance</i>. The theatrical show consisting mainly of traditional Irish music and dance took the world by storm and has been a global phenomenon ever since. Now, twenty-five years later, the Irish dancing community consists of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people around the world today. Teachers from around the world have committed themselves to spreading their love and passion for Ireland’s traditional form of expression. Regardless of how far a dancer progresses competitively or professionally, being an Irish dancer is something that is inextricably bound to their identity forevermore. In this piece entitled “The Dancer,” you feel the excitement, the confidence, and the artistry that comes from expressing a centuries-old tradition that has touched the hearts of many.</p><p><strong><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593453883/lt5tbpqwtq18cgmnymdc.jpg"" src=""""/>The Session:</u></strong></p><p>A session is a casual gathering of musicians playing traditional Irish music, usually taking place in a pub, but has also been known to take place on street corners or even in someone’s kitchen. Irish “trad” music has garnered a deep appreciation, not just in Ireland, but also around the world. It’s important to note that a session is more than just a casual jam between musicians – the focus is on the instrumental tunes found within the Irish tradition – reels, jigs, hornpipes, polkas, slip jigs, and the like. Whether it be in a pub or someone’s home, sessions are times of brilliant music and ever-flowing drink that have a certain habit of continuing late into the night, if not into the wee hours of the morning!</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593453900/x2gmrmw5rhfzsgmnps42.jpg"" src=""""/></u></p><p><u><strong>The Pub:</strong></u></p><p>There is much more to an Irish pub than just having a drink. In Ireland, pubs are central to the way of life. Similar to a church, they represent a pillar of Irish social life and community. A place where pints, comfort food, live music, and sport can be always be found; somewhere you can meet friends, neighbors, or even complete strangers, in an inviting atmosphere. It’s for these reasons that recreations of Irish pubs can be found in any city around the world. O'Connor’s was opened as a pub in Galway in 1942 by Thomas O'Connor, and is currently operated by third generation O’Connors. Every inch of it decorated in eclectic memorabilia, the pub has become famous for its hospitality and world-class live music. So much so that Ed Sheeran used it as the location of his music video “Galway Girl” in 2017 featuring actress Saoirse Ronan, furthering the pub’s world-wide recognition.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593453926/t3pxigcbnkag8qpzbz66.jpg"" src=""""/></u></p><p><strong><u>The Wit:</u></strong></p><p>“<i>Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.” </i></p><p><i>“To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.”</i></p><p>These are just two quotes from one of the biggest literary personalities in Ireland’s history, Oscar Wilde. A literary treasure, Wilde was a hugely popular playwright and poet in the late 1800s. Besides well-known works such as <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray </i>and <i>Lady Windermere’s Fan</i>, his biting wit and flamboyant style gained him notoriety as well. As a people, the Irish are known for their good sense of humour, which has bolstered them during periods of great hardship throughout history. Wilde embodied this intrinsically Irish trait to the very end. Even as he faced death, he was cracking jokes and reportedly said, “This wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. Either it goes or I do.” A collection of art in support of Irish culture would be incomplete without paying homage to Oscar Wilde.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593453965/zrtttgum1wvjurjuttij.jpg"" src=""""/></u></p><p><strong><u>The Myth:</u></strong></p><p><i>Ériu</i> is the goddess of sovereignty and the mythological mother of Ireland. She is often interpreted as the modern-day personification of Ireland. Along with her two sisters, Banba and Fódhla, Ériu was a part of a triumvirate of goddesses. Before their final defeat, each goddess requested that the island be named for her. This was granted to all of them, but Ériu became the chief name in use. The old Irish name Ériu evolved into Éire in modern Irish and depending on the case is spelled Éireann or Éirinn. This is how we finally arrived with the English name for the country, Erin.</p><p>The painting has been imbued with symbols to depict all that Ériu embodied within pre-Christian Irish culture. Ériu represents the sacred feminine, as illustrated in the column capitals, or the decorative element at the top of a column, that represent the three phases of a woman’s life cycle – the maid, mother and crone. The stars behind her and the lunala around her neck evoke her role as a lunar goddess. Her hair bleeds into the trees, depicting her connection to the earth and its bounty. She holds this bounty in her hand as a glass of mead, which was served at the feast of Goibhniu, and offered immortality to those that drank it. Around her head is a ring of knot work encasing the land, which is topped by the stone of divisions from the hill of Uisneach, the symbolic and sacred centre of the island in Irish mythology. Ériu’s bones are said to have been laid to rest on this hill and serves as a gateway between the Underworld and the world above.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593454027/zhvt8qx3e2qbzifqic4r.png"" src=""""/></u></p><p><strong><u>The Rose: </u></strong></p><p>Ireland has a rich tradition of various festivals taking place throughout each year. The Rose of Tralee was first held in 1959 and has since been held every August in Tralee, County Kerry, to select a young woman to be crowned the Rose. Cities all over the world host their own selection balls to determine who will represent them in Ireland. The festival bills itself as a celebration of the ""aspirations, ambitions, intellect, social responsibility, and Irish heritage"" of modern young women. Bursting with music and dancing, this festival celebrates the very best of Irish culture and the future of Irish relations worldwide. The winner and their family become a part of a global network, showcasing how Irish culture is thriving amongst the Irish Diaspora. They say, “Once a Rose, always a Rose.”</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593454088/kd4fj9dle8slor2vtoyx.jpg"" src=""""/></u></p><p><u><strong>The Gig:</strong></u></p><p>Ireland and Scotland combined have a rich culture within the performing arts, which has resulted in a thriving gig scene. Musicians are constantly pushing the boundaries in order to create new and fresh work that is often steeped in tradition. Many are staunch believers that musical traditions must be preserved as they always have been – the “play it like my father used to” kind of sentimentality. Yet, every generation brings a new wave of talent that feels that this attitude discourages progress and evolution. This debate between tradition and innovation is a tale as old as time. Still, many feel it is possible to honour your origins while also exploring and adapting to the future; they are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>Irish music legend, Míchéal Ó Súilleabháinn, believed that traditions are never frozen, but rather are fluid. He believed that the idea of authenticity originating from a pure source located in antiquity was bogus! This painting is for the new wave of artists and musicians who are creating some of the most incredible new-age folk / Trad music in the world. Project Smok, Beoga, Talisk, Ímar and the like are leading the way for the future of Irish music.</p><p>“Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.” - George Bernard Shaw</p><p> </p><p><strong>Here's the problem:</strong><br/><br/>While established organisations and big business may receive government funding to help overcome these financial challenges, we are interested in providing assistance to the thousands of <strong>self-employed</strong> <strong>individuals, schools, clubs and smaller organisations</strong> who teach, perform and share their craft within the performing arts that define our culture.</p><p>It's simply a fact that mass gatherings as we were previously accustomed to will be the last thing that will be allowed to resume as normal, meaning that music concerts, album releases, stage productions, dancing competitions, festivals, etc. will most likely feel the effects of COVID-19 longer than any other industry. <br/><br/>We have all are all currently doing our part by social distancing and self-isolating at home in an effort to get control over the spread of COVID-19. During this chapter of <strong>doom and gloom</strong>, people are finding joy and welcome escape in all of the creative content that is being uploaded on social media. This has highlighted what a vital role entertainment and the arts, in all of its forms, are to our society and how it is the glue that connects us all to each other. People are using creative expression to bring <strong>joy, inspiration and meaning</strong> to others. We’ve seen virtual concerts on Zoom, brilliant collaborations with dancers and musicians far and wide and TikTok after TikTok and hilarious memes that we’ll never forget. It’s true that the arts create hope and healing.</p><p><br/>Yet, as restrictions ease and we begin rebuilding essential businesses and local economies, there will be significant cuts in areas that are deemed nonessential. Potentially, what will have been a very large part of what helped us endure this pandemic will suffer. We must ensure that performing artists (<strong>actors, dancers, musicians, singers, theatres and leaders within artistic disciplines</strong>) do not just survive, but thrive after we emerge from this!<br/> </p><p><strong>Here’s our solution:</strong></p><p>Our culture is what unites us. It’s the glue that binds us altogether regardless where in the world we may be. It’s the music, the dance, the song, the wit and written word and the craic. Ireland may be a small island but more than 80 million people around the world call her home. There are roughly 30 million Irish Americans in the States, while the total population of Ireland is just 6.2 million. The Irish global population is a tight knit one that stretches across nearly every country on the planet. I have always said that if the world is six degrees of separation, Ireland is two and Irish dancing is one. If you know one person, you know them all.</p><p>Imagine if we were able to get donations from just 1% of that population. What unbelievable relief could we provide to the people who help define our own identity as being Irish? That is why we’re seeking donations to support everything that it means to be Irish and calling upon anyone who identifies or has every enjoyed the fruits of Irish culture. There’s a saying in Irish, “ní neart go cur le chéile,” which means “<strong>There is no strength without unity.” </strong>And now is the time, more than ever, to unite as one people and band together.</p><p>Once we have achieved our fundraising goal we will begin accepting applications and start distribute the money directly to <strong>anyone</strong> within the Irish performing arts or any cultural endeavours in need of financial support.</p><p>This fundraising campaign is intended to help alleviate this newfound reality so many have found themselves in. Even though you can’t go to a show or a concert to see or hear anyone perform, but you can still support them. This new collection of paintings is available to anyone and everyone who feels a connection to Ireland and her culture.</p><p><strong>We have intentionally priced the prints at roughly the cost of a typical social gathering / interaction, for example:</strong></p><ol>
<li>What’s the average price of a ticket to a: shows, concerts or gigs you were unable to attend because of COVID-19?</li>
<li>What’s the average price to enter a dancing competition?</li>
<li>On average what would you spend on a round of drinks?</li>
<li>What’s the average price of admission into a lecture or seminar?</li>
</ol><p>International travel is surely to be heavily restricted for the foreseeable future so if you love Ireland and identity with the culture, but maybe can’t visit or return anytime soon we would ask that you consider buying a print to support this cause.</p><p>Let’s use these prints as a reminder of the times we have endured and the things we have sacrificed and hopefully these paintings will be a reminder of the things that we truly value as a people and a culture.</p><p> </p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593455045/obpwzcev73k2zgh2mits.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong>Technical Information:</strong></p><p>All of the artwork has been professionally scanned at one of the leading Fine Art reproduction firms in the United States called Coupralux.

She is also one of the leading and finest portrait artists in the world with an extensive clientele. Shannon has also had a career as a singer, having recorded several albums. Her first, in 2005, was a Grammy contender, being nominated in three categories: best album, best song and best female vocalist, where Shannon’s name was beneath Alicia Keys'. </p><p>This isn’t the first time Shannon has used her artwork to raise awareness for charitable and noble causes. After the horrific terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, Shannon painted two life-sized paintings of a policeman and a fireman and called them <i>The New Twin Towers</i>. The paintings were sent to New York City, where they resided in the front windows of Ground Zero’s popular restaurant, Gino’s, alerting the first responders where they could come and eat for free. Because of their high visibility and historical significance, the paintings were acquired by the New York Historical Society and the Fireman’s Museum.</p><p>In 2006, Shannon received word that she’d won the Lilly Oncology International Art Contest for her painting “Will He Still Love Me?” out of 2000 entries from 43 countries. Her painting traveled to the Royal Academy of London for a week’s exhibition and from there, toured the world for the next two years, raising money for the cause of breast cancer.</p><p>In 2007, Shannon painted the cover of a book titled <i>TORCH</i>, written by survivors of ovarian cancer. It was the authors’ hope to be invited onto the Oprah show to discuss ovarian cancer, which gets much less press than other cancers. When months of trying proved fruitless, Shannon had the idea of painting Oprah, herself, in a way that portrayed her humanitarian spirit, by depicting her with one of the children from her leadership academy in Johannesburg, South Africa. Included in the crate with the painting was the <i>TORCH</i> book and all the local press it had received. It surely got their attention and when Oprah came to open the Texas State Fair that fall, she and Shannon got to meet and discuss the <i>TORCH </i>ladies and their project. Oprah promised to have a show discussing ovarian cancer as soon as it was possible. She was true to her word and the following summer, there were two shows devoted to the subject by her successor, Dr. Oz. Oprah had her portrait shipped to the school in South Africa, where it hangs above the mantle in the library and is said to be the students’ favorite piece of art on the entire campus. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593454506/uwjyd44oyuvlanybgqkb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593454526/loqrc0syecmlbsivwtrc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Kincaid Stringer is a former dancer with <i>Riverdance</i>, entrepreneur and currently teaches with The Hession School of Irish Dancing in Galway, Ireland.

While many industries were able to continue to function in some capacity during shutdown these pillars within our culture are undoubtedly one of the hardest hit from this global crisis. Ireland is a nation of artists and a land bursting with culture that has brought the world the likes of: Riverdance, Enya, Oscar Wilde, Niall Horan, Pierce Brosnan, Saoirse Ronan, Cillian Murphy, Bono and Liam Neeson. Not to mention the added plethora of talent that has stemmed from the Irish Diaspora thereafter. The list goes on and on, but what it proves is how influential and deeply embedded Irish art and culture are in global society even amongst people who aren’t Irish. In fact, St. Patrick’s Day is the only national holiday that is celebrated throughout the entire world!My mother, Shannon Kincaid, is a Fine Artist and I, myself, am a former dancer with Riverdance and an entrepreneur who is passionate about Ireland. Together, we have collaborated to create a new series of paintings depicting the various pillars of Irish culture and we are offering prints of them with 100% of the profits going directly to support:
Irish musicians, singers and performers
Irish dancing schools, clubs and professional dancers
Actors, writers and artists
Festivals and concerts
Theatres and event/cultural spaces
Crews & other essential backstage workers
 All of these various people, groups and institutions have experienced extreme financial hardships after the past several months. Built up rents on studio/rehearsal spaces, cancelled tours and performance runs with no end in sight, pubs and other cultural hubs closed could potentially cripple these industries in a way that they might never recover. It’s also highly likely that funding for upcoming and new projects will suffer. While debunked, it was long rumoured that During WWII Winston Churchill was asked to cut funding for the arts to which he replied, “then what are we fighting for?”  He was quoted, however, saying ““The arts are essential to any complete national life. The State owes it to itself to sus­tain and encour­age them…. Ill fares the race which fails to salute the arts with the rev­er­ence and delight which are their due.” As we fight this current war against the novel coronavirus it feels very fitting to try and use art to help save the entire culture and industry within the arts.While some would argue that these industries and these areas are nonessential, I would argue the exact opposite. However, I understand the difference between charitable donations to the healthcare system and frontline workers, which is why we are not asking for people’s charity without giving them the option to get something in return. While, there is the option to donate simply out of charity, donations of $25+ will allow people to choose a piece of art that resonates most with them. This collection of art illustrates the greatest parts of Irish culture: music, dance, literature, mythology, festivals and pub culture. We want to make art that celebrates the very best of Irish culture and make accessible to everyone who identifies with it. This is a means of uniting the global Irish community together under a common cause to ensure Irish culture thrives in the times ahead.Shannon in her studio The Art of Irish Culture Collection: The Dancer:Irish people’s love of dancing has been well documented throughout their written history. In fact, one of the earliest references to dancing details a visit between the Mayor of Waterford and Mayor of Baltimore in 1413. The modern Irish dancing of today is no longer merely a processional combination of singing and dancing as an act of celebrating, but a sport that produces athletes that are physically strong, as well as creative and artistic. What was once a tradition specific to Ireland (as well as England, Scotland, and some parts of America) caught like wildfire in 1994 with the debut of Riverdance. The theatrical show consisting mainly of traditional Irish music and dance took the world by storm and has been a global phenomenon ever since. Now, twenty-five years later, the Irish dancing community consists of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people around the world today. Teachers from around the world have committed themselves to spreading their love and passion for Ireland’s traditional form of expression. Regardless of how far a dancer progresses competitively or professionally, being an Irish dancer is something that is inextricably bound to their identity forevermore. In this piece entitled “The Dancer,” you feel the excitement, the confidence, and the artistry that comes from expressing a centuries-old tradition that has touched the hearts of many.The Session:A session is a casual gathering of musicians playing traditional Irish music, usually taking place in a pub, but has also been known to take place on street corners or even in someone’s kitchen. Irish “trad” music has garnered a deep appreciation, not just in Ireland, but also around the world. It’s important to note that a session is more than just a casual jam between musicians – the focus is on the instrumental tunes found within the Irish tradition – reels, jigs, hornpipes, polkas, slip jigs, and the like. Whether it be in a pub or someone’s home, sessions are times of brilliant music and ever-flowing drink that have a certain habit of continuing late into the night, if not into the wee hours of the morning! The Pub:There is much more to an Irish pub than just having a drink. In Ireland, pubs are central to the way of life. Similar to a church, they represent a pillar of Irish social life and community. A place where pints, comfort food, live music, and sport can be always be found; somewhere you can meet friends, neighbors, or even complete strangers, in an inviting atmosphere. It’s for these reasons that recreations of Irish pubs can be found in any city around the world. O'Connor’s was opened as a pub in Galway in 1942 by Thomas O'Connor, and is currently operated by third generation O’Connors. Every inch of it decorated in eclectic memorabilia, the pub has become famous for its hospitality and world-class live music. So much so that Ed Sheeran used it as the location of his music video “Galway Girl” in 2017 featuring actress Saoirse Ronan, furthering the pub’s world-wide recognition. The Wit:“Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.” “To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.”These are just two quotes from one of the biggest literary personalities in Ireland’s history, Oscar Wilde. A literary treasure, Wilde was a hugely popular playwright and poet in the late 1800s. Besides well-known works such as The Picture of Dorian Gray and Lady Windermere’s Fan, his biting wit and flamboyant style gained him notoriety as well. As a people, the Irish are known for their good sense of humour, which has bolstered them during periods of great hardship throughout history. Wilde embodied this intrinsically Irish trait to the very end. Even as he faced death, he was cracking jokes and reportedly said, “This wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. Either it goes or I do.” A collection of art in support of Irish culture would be incomplete without paying homage to Oscar Wilde. The Myth:Ériu is the goddess of sovereignty and the mythological mother of Ireland. She is often interpreted as the modern-day personification of Ireland. Along with her two sisters, Banba and Fódhla, Ériu was a part of a triumvirate of goddesses. Before their final defeat, each goddess requested that the island be named for her. This was granted to all of them, but Ériu became the chief name in use. The old Irish name Ériu evolved into Éire in modern Irish and depending on the case is spelled Éireann or Éirinn. This is how we finally arrived with the English name for the country, Erin.The painting has been imbued with symbols to depict all that Ériu embodied within pre-Christian Irish culture. Ériu represents the sacred feminine, as illustrated in the column capitals, or the decorative element at the top of a column, that represent the three phases of a woman’s life cycle – the maid, mother and crone. The stars behind her and the lunala around her neck evoke her role as a lunar goddess. Her hair bleeds into the trees, depicting her connection to the earth and its bounty. She holds this bounty in her hand as a glass of mead, which was served at the feast of Goibhniu, and offered immortality to those that drank it. Around her head is a ring of knot work encasing the land, which is topped by the stone of divisions from the hill of Uisneach, the symbolic and sacred centre of the island in Irish mythology. Ériu’s bones are said to have been laid to rest on this hill and serves as a gateway between the Underworld and the world above. The Rose: Ireland has a rich tradition of various festivals taking place throughout each year. The Rose of Tralee was first held in 1959 and has since been held every August in Tralee, County Kerry, to select a young woman to be crowned the Rose. Cities all over the world host their own selection balls to determine who will represent them in Ireland. The festival bills itself as a celebration of the ""aspirations, ambitions, intellect, social responsibility, and Irish heritage"" of modern young women. Bursting with music and dancing, this festival celebrates the very best of Irish culture and the future of Irish relations worldwide. The winner and their family become a part of a global network, showcasing how Irish culture is thriving amongst the Irish Diaspora. They say, “Once a Rose, always a Rose.” The Gig:Ireland and Scotland combined have a rich culture within the performing arts, which has resulted in a thriving gig scene. Musicians are constantly pushing the boundaries in order to create new and fresh work that is often steeped in tradition. Many are staunch believers that musical traditions must be preserved as they always have been – the “play it like my father used to” kind of sentimentality. Yet, every generation brings a new wave of talent that feels that this attitude discourages progress and evolution. This debate between tradition and innovation is a tale as old as time. Still, many feel it is possible to honour your origins while also exploring and adapting to the future; they are not mutually exclusive.Irish music legend, Míchéal Ó Súilleabháinn, believed that traditions are never frozen, but rather are fluid. He believed that the idea of authenticity originating from a pure source located in antiquity was bogus! This painting is for the new wave of artists and musicians who are creating some of the most incredible new-age folk / Trad music in the world. Project Smok, Beoga, Talisk, Ímar and the like are leading the way for the future of Irish music.“Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.” - George Bernard Shaw Here's the problem:While established organisations and big business may receive government funding to help overcome these financial challenges, we are interested in providing assistance to the thousands of self-employed individuals, schools, clubs and smaller organisations who teach, perform and share their craft within the performing arts that define our culture.It's simply a fact that mass gatherings as we were previously accustomed to will be the last thing that will be allowed to resume as normal, meaning that music concerts, album releases, stage productions, dancing competitions, festivals, etc. will most likely feel the effects of COVID-19 longer than any other industry. We have all are all currently doing our part by social distancing and self-isolating at home in an effort to get control over the spread of COVID-19. During this chapter of doom and gloom, people are finding joy and welcome escape in all of the creative content that is being uploaded on social media. This has highlighted what a vital role entertainment and the arts, in all of its forms, are to our society and how it is the glue that connects us all to each other. People are using creative expression to bring joy, inspiration and meaning to others. We’ve seen virtual concerts on Zoom, brilliant collaborations with dancers and musicians far and wide and TikTok after TikTok and hilarious memes that we’ll never forget. It’s true that the arts create hope and healing.Yet, as restrictions ease and we begin rebuilding essential businesses and local economies, there will be significant cuts in areas that are deemed nonessential. Potentially, what will have been a very large part of what helped us endure this pandemic will suffer. We must ensure that performing artists (actors, dancers, musicians, singers, theatres and leaders within artistic disciplines) do not just survive, but thrive after we emerge from this! Here’s our solution:Our culture is what unites us. It’s the glue that binds us altogether regardless where in the world we may be. It’s the music, the dance, the song, the wit and written word and the craic. Ireland may be a small island but more than 80 million people around the world call her home. There are roughly 30 million Irish Americans in the States, while the total population of Ireland is just 6.2 million. The Irish global population is a tight knit one that stretches across nearly every country on the planet. I have always said that if the world is six degrees of separation, Ireland is two and Irish dancing is one. If you know one person, you know them all.Imagine if we were able to get donations from just 1% of that population. What unbelievable relief could we provide to the people who help define our own identity as being Irish? That is why we’re seeking donations to support everything that it means to be Irish and calling upon anyone who identifies or has every enjoyed the fruits of Irish culture. There’s a saying in Irish, “ní neart go cur le chéile,” which means “There is no strength without unity.” And now is the time, more than ever, to unite as one people and band together.Once we have achieved our fundraising goal we will begin accepting applications and start distribute the money directly to anyone within the Irish performing arts or any cultural endeavours in need of financial support.This fundraising campaign is intended to help alleviate this newfound reality so many have found themselves in. Even though you can’t go to a show or a concert to see or hear anyone perform, but you can still support them. This new collection of paintings is available to anyone and everyone who feels a connection to Ireland and her culture.We have intentionally priced the prints at roughly the cost of a typical social gathering / interaction, for example:
What’s the average price of a ticket to a: shows, concerts or gigs you were unable to attend because of COVID-19?
What’s the average price to enter a dancing competition?
On average what would you spend on a round of drinks?
What’s the average price of admission into a lecture or seminar?
International travel is surely to be heavily restricted for the foreseeable future so if you love Ireland and identity with the culture, but maybe can’t visit or return anytime soon we would ask that you consider buying a print to support this cause.Let’s use these prints as a reminder of the times we have endured and the things we have sacrificed and hopefully these paintings will be a reminder of the things that we truly value as a people and a culture. Technical Information:All of the artwork has been professionally scanned at one of the leading Fine Art reproduction firms in the United States called Coupralux. Together we have designed the layout of each print and approved the samples. We are just waiting to place the official order with our printer once the campaign is completed!Sizes are as follows: 
The Dancer: 12”x10”
The Session: 10”x14”

They are extremely affordable and come in nearly any style you can imagine! A little more about Shannon and Kincaid:Shannon is a versatile fine artist whose portfolio includes paintings of Oprah Winfrey, James Bond Girl, Luciana Paluzzi, Mickey Mantle and The Dallas Cowboy’s legendary coach, Tom Landry. She is also one of the leading and finest portrait artists in the world with an extensive clientele. Shannon has also had a career as a singer, having recorded several albums. Her first, in 2005, was a Grammy contender, being nominated in three categories: best album, best song and best female vocalist, where Shannon’s name was beneath Alicia Keys'. This isn’t the first time Shannon has used her artwork to raise awareness for charitable and noble causes. After the horrific terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, Shannon painted two life-sized paintings of a policeman and a fireman and called them The New Twin Towers. The paintings were sent to New York City, where they resided in the front windows of Ground Zero’s popular restaurant, Gino’s, alerting the first responders where they could come and eat for free. Because of their high visibility and historical significance, the paintings were acquired by the New York Historical Society and the Fireman’s Museum.In 2006, Shannon received word that she’d won the Lilly Oncology International Art Contest for her painting “Will He Still Love Me?” out of 2000 entries from 43 countries. Her painting traveled to the Royal Academy of London for a week’s exhibition and from there, toured the world for the next two years, raising money for the cause of breast cancer.In 2007, Shannon painted the cover of a book titled TORCH, written by survivors of ovarian cancer. It was the authors’ hope to be invited onto the Oprah show to discuss ovarian cancer, which gets much less press than other cancers. When months of trying proved fruitless, Shannon had the idea of painting Oprah, herself, in a way that portrayed her humanitarian spirit, by depicting her with one of the children from her leadership academy in Johannesburg, South Africa. Included in the crate with the painting was the TORCH book and all the local press it had received. It surely got their attention and when Oprah came to open the Texas State Fair that fall, she and Shannon got to meet and discuss the TORCH ladies and their project. Oprah promised to have a show discussing ovarian cancer as soon as it was possible. She was true to her word and the following summer, there were two shows devoted to the subject by her successor, Dr. Oz. Oprah had her portrait shipped to the school in South Africa, where it hangs above the mantle in the library and is said to be the students’ favorite piece of art on the entire campus.  Kincaid Stringer is a former dancer with Riverdance, entrepreneur and currently teaches with The Hession School of Irish Dancing in Galway, Ireland. In 2011 he was featured on the cover of the Irish Dance Magazine as the first ""Man of The Year."" He has performed all over the world and is proud to share his love for Irish culture where ever he goes.  He has also an active member of the Ireland Fund's Young Leaders programme for the past six years which is a global fundraising network for people of Irish ancestry and friends of Ireland, dedicated to raising funds to support programs of peace and reconciliation, arts and culture, education and community development throughout the island of Ireland. Kincaid enlisted the help of his mother to create a collection of paintings that would fully manifest the idea of Irish art supporting the Irish arts. Together, they hope that the pieces resonate with others and bring the Irish community around the world a sense of togetherness during a time when we all had to remain apart. ""I hope to embolden and motivate the millions of Irish people around the world to take action and ensure that our people and our culture don’t survive, but thrive.""Kincaid pictured here with several of his pupils at The Hession ball celebrating their successes at the Irish Dancing World Championships in 2019.

 Why IndieGoGo?Other fundraising platforms like GoFundMe are great options when raising money for causes and other charities. We realised that the arts and culture didn’t fall within the immediate need for relief like that of frontline and healthcare providers, which is why we’ve chosen to use IndieGoGo so that we may offer backers various options to get something in return for supporting our cause. Together, we believe that we can unite the Irish Diaspora in support and celebration of our shared culture.Every little bit helps so even if you’re not in a place to contribute to our campaign right now, your voice is still valuable! Please take the time to share us on your various social media accounts and help spread the word amongst all of your friends! Risks and Challenges:While, we have set our fundraising goal at $250,000 we believe there is the potential to raise much more, which will all be dedicated to supporting the Irish arts and culture. It’s a win-win for everyone. People who love Ireland not only get a piece of Fine Art that illustrates the various aspects of our culture, but they also get the satisfaction of knowing that they were able to contribute to a fund that will help preserve and grow Irish culture going forward.The great challenge we foresee is getting the campaign in front of as many people as possible. Our initial fundraising goal requires at that we have 10,000 people back the campaign provided they purchase one print. But, there are millions of Irish people around the world who we are confident this project will resonate with so we just have to work hard enough to ensure that they hear about what we’re doing.If for any reason you have questions or concerns, please feel free to email us at:irishartsandculturefund@gmail.com and we will get back to as soon as possible! We thank you for your consideration.- Kincaid & Shannon",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

We narrate from shared and own experiences, an alternative to the dominant discourse, visibilizing and promoting rebellions that defy oppressions and established orders. Our core work are communication, free training and cultural management.</p><p> </p><p>ABOUT ""LA MUNAY""</p><p>Munay is a quechua word; is a principle that tells us about the will of love and reciprocal love as the main axis of life, something as simple as walking together in the same direction, even if we are different in body and mind.</p><p>Seven months ago we opened our house with the help of several feminist partners from Huancayo city, because in our hearts we know that there is another way out and another possible world. A world where fit those who has escaped from the norm, those who do not fit in their moral and who question the patriarchal order. Diversity is incompatible with a system bent on denying the possibility of the existence of other identities, other bodies and other ways of living and experiment sexuality and gender. In the world we aspire, diversity is the base for a real, inclusive, egalitarian and just democracy.</p><p>We dream that feminism invades all the spaces in which we are socialized and with its transformative and revolutionary capacity allows us to meet others. We speak about a space for all, open to our feelings and thinkings, generating a mystical collective more solidarity, participatory and community processes between accomplices that generate deep micropolitical transformations, networks of affection and creativity, collective actions against oppression in favor of freedom and the right to renounce to imposed forms of life, autonomy, visibility, happiness of women and dissidents of sexuality and gender.</p><p>La Munay is synonymous for strength and illusion, a filled space of apprenticeship to understand where we come from and continue building a collective feminist responses against machism. An increasingly complicated task in a city like Huancayo</p><p>Since the opening of La Munay, we have been carrying out several activities, workshops, meetings, talks, traveling library, art events, etc.</p><p> </p><p>WHY DO WE DO IT?</p><p>Feminism is not just a struggle to add, it is a central pillar of society that we aspire to build. It is a tool for self-organization, empowerment, and political development, for women who find in the feminist movement a space from which to be protagonists of our struggle. And it is as a movement that puts the system upside down, by calling into question what the logic that moves the world should be.

Un mundo donde tengamos cabida quienes escapamos de la norma, quienes no encajamos en su moral y que cuestionamos el orden patriarcal. La diversidad es incompatible con un sistema empeñado en negar la posibilidad de la existencia de otras identidades, otros cuerpos y otras formas de vivir y experimentar la sexualidad y el género. En el mundo al que aspiramos la diversidad es la base para una democracia real, inclusiva, igualitaria y justa.Soñamos que el feminismo invada todos los espacios en los que somos socializadas para que su capacidad transformadora y revolucionaria nos permita encontrarnos con otras, otros y otres. Hablamos de un espacio para todes, abierto a nuestros sentires y pensares generando místicas colectivas más solidarias, participativas y  procesos comunitarios entre cómplices que activen profundas transformaciones micropolíticas, redes de afecto y creatividad, acción colectiva contra las opresiones a favor de la libertad y al derecho a renunciar a las formas de vida impuestas, la autonomía, la visibilidad, la felicidad de las mujeres y las personas disidentes de la sexualidad y el género.La Munay es sinónimo de ilusión y fuerza, un espacio lleno de aprendizajes para entender de dónde venimos y continuar construyendo respuestas feministas colectivas contra el machismo. Una tarea cada vez más complicada en una ciudad como Huancayo Desde la apertura de La Munay, venimos realizando diversas actividades, talleres, encuentros, conversatorios,  biblioteca ambulante, eventos artísticos, etc.¿POR QUE LO HACEMOS?El feminismo no es sólo una lucha más que sumar, es un pilar central de la sociedad que aspiramos a construir. Lo es como herramienta de auto-organización, de empoderamiento, de elaboración política, para las mujeres que encontramos en el movimiento feminista un espacio desde el que ser protagonistas de nuestra lucha. Y lo es como movimiento que pone patas arriba el sistema, al poner en cuestión cuál debe ser la lógica que mueva el mundo. El feminismo trata de visibilizar lo invisible, de dar voz a quien no la tiene y de politizar lo cotidiano. El PROBLEMADurante estos siete meses de existencia La Munay ha venido trabajando desde la economía solidaria y la autogestión, nos unimos para hacerle frente a las lógicas capitalistas de consumo y producción en un mundo patriarcal y hostil para las mujeres y personas LGTBIQ, en donde el encontrarse es una necesidad  en épocas de crisis que nos pegan siempre más duro a nosotrxs.Les somos honestas, no ha sido sencillo. El individualismo ha dificultando que nos relacionemos a partir de lo que necesitamos conjuntamente y día a día se confabula para que espacios como el nuestro no abran más. QUE HAREMOS CON TU AYUDACon tu aporte buscamos seguir manteniendo abierta LA MUNAY y que siga ofreciendo un espacio inclusivo, un espacio liberado  de actitudes opresoras, donde fortalecernos, cuidarnos y hacer que la lucha feminista se visibilice, multiplique y propague. A la vez también queremos ampliar los servicios que ofrecemos a las mujeres, poder gestionar más actividades y implementar una biblioteca, una sala de proyección, entre otras cosas. ¡Ayúdanos a seguir tejiendo nuestros sueños y esperanzas! Además:¿Cómo donar si no tienes tarjeta de crédito o débito?

We narrate from shared and own experiences, an alternative to the dominant discourse, visibilizing and promoting rebellions that defy oppressions and established orders. Our core work are communication, free training and cultural management. ABOUT ""LA MUNAY""Munay is a quechua word; is a principle that tells us about the will of love and reciprocal love as the main axis of life, something as simple as walking together in the same direction, even if we are different in body and mind.Seven months ago we opened our house with the help of several feminist partners from Huancayo city, because in our hearts we know that there is another way out and another possible world. A world where fit those who has escaped from the norm, those who do not fit in their moral and who question the patriarchal order. Diversity is incompatible with a system bent on denying the possibility of the existence of other identities, other bodies and other ways of living and experiment sexuality and gender. In the world we aspire, diversity is the base for a real, inclusive, egalitarian and just democracy.We dream that feminism invades all the spaces in which we are socialized and with its transformative and revolutionary capacity allows us to meet others. We speak about a space for all, open to our feelings and thinkings, generating a mystical collective more solidarity, participatory and community processes between accomplices that generate deep micropolitical transformations, networks of affection and creativity, collective actions against oppression in favor of freedom and the right to renounce to imposed forms of life, autonomy, visibility, happiness of women and dissidents of sexuality and gender.La Munay is synonymous for strength and illusion, a filled space of apprenticeship to understand where we come from and continue building a collective feminist responses against machism. An increasingly complicated task in a city like HuancayoSince the opening of La Munay, we have been carrying out several activities, workshops, meetings, talks, traveling library, art events, etc. WHY DO WE DO IT?Feminism is not just a struggle to add, it is a central pillar of society that we aspire to build. It is a tool for self-organization, empowerment, and political development, for women who find in the feminist movement a space from which to be protagonists of our struggle. And it is as a movement that puts the system upside down, by calling into question what the logic that moves the world should be. Feminism tries to make visible the invisible, to give voice to those who do not have it and to politicize the everyday. THE PROBLEMDuring these seven months of existence La Munay has been working from the solidarity economy and self-management, we unite to face the capitalist logics of consumption and production in a patriarchal and hostile world for women and LGTBIQ people, where is a necessity meet us in times of crisis that always hit us harder.If we are honest, it has not been easy.Individualism has made it difficult for us to relate from what we need as group and day by day is conspiring for spaces like ours do not open anymore. WHAT WE WILL DO WITH YOUR HELPWith your contribution, we look for to continue to keep open LA MUNAY and continue to offering an inclusive space, a space liberated from oppressive attitudes, where we can strengthen and take care of ourselves and make the feminist struggle become visible, multiply and propagate.At the same time we also want to expand the services we offer to women, to be able to manage more activities and to implement a library, a projection room, among other things.Help us to continue weaving our dreams and hopes!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Bonjour à tous ! L’Association Capoeira Bénin (A.C.B.) a le plaisir de vous présenter ce projet de Festival International de Capoeira au Bénin ! Chaque jour, nous découvrons un peu plus l’histoire afro-brésilienne qui est ancrée dans notre patrimoine, par exemple dans l’architecture (villes de Porto Novo, Agoué, Ouidah), dans les dialectes (dans les mots Tchavi - Clé, Igredja-église, Akara-beignet de beurre), et dans notre culture (en cuisine, danse, cérémonies, et capoeira !)… Le festival que nous organisons est une occasion de partager ces découvertes avec vous.</p>
<p><i>– Hello everybody! The Association Capoeira Benin (</i><i>A.C.B.</i><i>) is happy to present you this project of International Capoeira Festival in Benin! Every day, we discover a little bit more on afro-Brazilian history, which is represented in an architectural, linguistic and cultural heritage here in Benin. This festival is an opportunity to share about this heritage, and acknowledge the African influence in Brazilian culture.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>La Capoeira au Bénin – <i>Capoeira in Benin</i></strong></p>
<p>La capoeira est un art de combat et danse afro-brésilien originaire des pratiques des peuples africains du temps de l'esclavage au Brésil. La capoeira consiste en un jeu entre deux personnes qui se pratique dans un espace circulaire (la roda) formé par un nombre indéfini de personnes qui chantent en rythme. La Capoeira est reconnue comme patrimoine culturel immatériel de l'humanité (UNESCO, 2014). Elle représente une activité culturelle, d’éducation physique et sportive, et permet de développer la discipline, sociabilité, sensibilité, coordination, musique et l’autonomie, à tous les âges, genres, races et religions.</p>
<p>La pratique de la capoeira au Bénin est relativement récente : le premier et le seul groupe de Capoeira au Bénin, Ogun Eru (Capoeira, lutte et héritage des Africains contraints à l'esclavage) a commencé en 2003 sous l’initiative de Mamoudou FASSASSI. Plus d'une centaine d'étudiants font maintenant partie du groupe ! L'Association Capoeira Bénin (A.C.B.), créée en 2013, soutient le groupe à promouvoir la capoeira au Bénin, en Afrique de l'Ouest et dans le reste du monde.</p>
<p><i>–</i><i> Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian martial art and dance originating from practices from African communities in the time of slavery in Brazil. It consists of a two-player game practiced in a circular space (the Roda), formed by other people playing music and singing in rhythm. In 2014, Capoeira was inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Capoeira represents an excellent cultural, physical and educational activity which teaches discipline and sociability, stimulates sensibility, and helps develop motor skills.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The practice of Capoeira in Benin is very recent, as the first and only Capoeira group in Benin, Ogun Eru (Capoeira, fight and heritage of Africans forced to slavery), started in 2003. More than one hundred students are now part of the group and Capoeira has demonstrated its capacity to promote social and cultural development in Benin on multiple levels. The non-profit organization A.C.B was created in 2013, to support the group and promote Capoeira in Benin, West Africa and the rest of the world.</i></p>

<p><strong>Quel est le but de ce festival ? <i>– What is the objective of this festival ?</i></strong></p>
<p>Le festival aura lieu du 23 au 28 mai et inclura des ateliers de Capoeira pour tous les âges, des démonstrations de Capoeira, des visites touristiques et des conférences. Le caractère unique de cet événement est la cérémonie de <i>Formatura</i> du Mestre Fassassi: pour une première fois en Afrique, un africain va recevoir le titre de maître de capoeira.

<p>Having spent years working in journalism and later as a creative director in advertising, my everyday task is dealing with insight.

They answered the Festival’s call to offer a subtle, cosy and playful interpretation of the insular life for participants to softly dig into this culture and embrace its uniqueness. ​ 生活節一連三日嘅成本包括材料費、製作費、合作單位酬金、人力資源開支、宣傳費用、保險同緊急備用金，預算係港幣$457,000，有幸得到香港藝術發展局同信言設計大使贊助嘅港幣$367,000，計劃籌募餘下平衡成本嘅港幣$97,000。我哋而家由離島社區開始募捐，期望借呢個機會團結本地社區。而今次眾籌以預售生活節產品嘅方式，希望籌得尚欠金額中嘅港幣$50,000，同時透過眾籌引起大眾對香港離島文化同生態嘅關注。我哋相信才華同勞力都應該要得到回報，因此籌得款項主要會撥入合作單位酬金同人力資源開支，超出目標金額嘅部分，將會分配到因預算不足而被逼擱置或者縮減規模嘅活動計劃。感謝你嘅支持！ How are we funded?The 3-whole-day festival’s costs include materials, production, fees of collaborators, personnel, promotion, insurance and contingency. Our budget totals at HK$457,000. We are grateful to have received sponsorships from the Hong Kong Arts Development Council and Design Trust that amount to HK$367,000 in sum. We are currently raising funds from the local communities to inscribe the Festival in the local traditions and enhance the relationship and sense of belonging with the local communities.With this crowdfunding, we pre-sell some of our Festival souvenirs in hope to raise part of the remaining HK$97,000. We also believe it is a way for people to show their concern about Hong insular identity and our city landscape and invaluable nature. We hope you too will feel concerned and could contribute!Where will the donation go?Our target of HK$50,000 is the minimum we need to carry out the Festival. Thanks to our current sponsors, we can offer a (small) retribution to our collaborators, and pay for most of their material and production costs. However, the fees of personnel (staff, technicians, volunteers) and overall production (set-up, promotion,...) are the most in need. We hope everyone taking part in this Festival can receive a fair compensation for their work.What happens if we exceed our target?We had an ambitious plan to start with but the lack of fundings exacerbated by the current crisis forced us to scale down our plan. Therefore if we exceed our target, part of the donations will be allocated to our current collaborators so as to offer fair payments to their contributions. Next in line will be activities that are on hold or scaled-down because of the lack of funds. ​ 我哋為生活節準備咗一系列代表離島文化嘅產品，邀請島民匠人、設計師協作出品，凸顯島嶼智慧同現代生活嘅和諧。 

船到橋頭名信片: 用島民角度為你拍低一套六張，長洲芝麻灣梅窩坪洲，仲有我哋嘅橫水渡；

坪洲桑葉茶 X 手工皂: 天然手工小草皂房聯乘有機農夫品川一誠，用島產有機桑葉製作手工皂，坪洲天然獨家；

長洲手織漁網袋: 長洲品牌島中坊研協作設計，生活節限定釣魚袋；

橋頭福袋: 釣魚袋暗藏五款驚喜小物，留念島嶼生活文化。
 Like Inter-island Festival itself, our perks crystallise the different facets of the insular culture.  They are unique collaborations with craftsmen and designers from the islands that show the beauty and value of local know-hows and their compatibility with modern lifestyle.

Inter-island Postcards: 6 postcards showing unique angles from the six locations - Cheung Chau, Chi Ma Wan, Mui Wo, Peng Chau and the inter-island ferry;

Peng Chau Tea Soap: Collaborating with Peng Chau-based Green Green Soap and Issei Shinagawa, we offer this unique natural soap that reveals the properties of locally growing mulberry leaf tea! The tea is collected by Japanese farmer Issei Shinagawa and used by Green Green Soap to make this soap. Both of them will be fairly retributed when you chose this perk;

Cheung Chau Handmade Fishing Bag: Cheung Chau-based Island Workbench reinterprets its unique collaboration with local fishermen specially for the Festival! Reusing traditional craftsmanship, these bags show how local crafts can create beautiful items fit for our modern urban lifestyle; 

Surprise box: Together with the fishing bag, the soap and the postcards, you will find a set of five finely-selected little gifts that will let explore the local culture further.
 ​ 船到橋頭生活節嘅發起人係三個坪洲居民：城市規劃研究者Myriem Alnet、陸日小店老闆之一陳俊傑，與及藝術家同策展人葉啟俊。三人關注島嶼文化，其中Myriem同阿傑出版咗探討島嶼生活特式嘅雜誌<<島民>>，阿俊亦曾經喺島上籌辦藝術活動。面對當前變化，我哋想藉住生活節將島民同非島民連結，為保存同發展島嶼文化出一分力。另外，我哋組成咗橋頭團隊：長洲聯絡人黎穎欣、梅窩聯絡人陳希雯同吳若琪、文案寫作編輯施揚、平面設計Studio Orbit ，以更有效籌組生活節。 Inter-island Festival is initiated by Myriem Alnet, Chan Chun-kit and Yip Kai-chun. We have lived on Peng Chau for a few years.Myriem is an urbanist; Kit is one of the founders of Sun Sat Store on Peng Chau; and Chun is an artist-curator. Kit and Myriem have founded ‘ISLANDERS’, a zine on the island cultures, and Chun has organised small-scale art events on Peng Chau before.  Seeing the changes happening now and in the future, we want to take one step further to contribute to the islands and organise this Festival to connect everyone. We are joined on the sailing by Vanessa Lai Wing-yan (Cheung Chau correspondent), Chan Hei-man and Kay Ng (Mui Wo correspondents), Adrian Si (content writer & editor), Studio Orbit (graphic design).",10.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Getting Back to The Land, and to Each Other</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hello Friends, Family, and IndieGoGo Community,</strong></p>
<p>Our world is in crisis. <strong>Our current levels of consumption are not sustainable.</strong> The results of this overconsumption are the loss of farmland, growing urbanization, the destruction of the environment and a global food crisis. Simultaneously, social isolation is taking hold and we are growing more and more disconnected from each other with dire consequences to our physical, mental and emotional health. <strong>We need powerful solutions</strong> that we can integrate into our everyday realities that enable us to address these issues together.</p>
<p>This is what we are creating at <i>Abundance Community Farm</i>. <strong>We have developed a Community Agriculture model</strong> that bridges the gap between the city and the country and enables city dwellers to become farmers. It can be replicated  around the world to grow local organic food and create thriving communities that can better withstand the challenges and uncertainties of our global economy.<strong> Our model aims to improve quality of life for all </strong>by strengthening our connections to each other while reducing our ecological footprint through sharing resources.</p>
<p>We’ve had an amazing journey with implementing this model. It has allowed us to grow our in season produce and develop a deep sense connection to land and food. It has also enabled us to build rooted community and a sanctuary that kids and adults can come alive. This is truly providing us a better life with less, which is exactly what our world needs.<br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“<i>Visiting Abundance Community Farm is a coming home every time, home to the land and to the community. Just a few days there recharges me and reminds me of what is really important in life.</i>” ~ <strong>Bettine Rothe, Community Agriculture Member</strong></p>
<p><br/>We need your support to be able to spread this model and inspire others to take similar initiatives. We express our sincere gratitude for taking the time to consider supporting this campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Much Love and Gratitude</strong><br/>Amir &amp; the Abundance Team</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>MAJOR NEWS! ***</h3>
<p>We have been receiving some <strong>incredible donations and offerings</strong> to assist in our construction project including 80 bunk beds donated from Samesun Vancouver, and donations of building &amp; labour for our barn renovations! This means we can manage the project with a lower budget of $80,000 - which we have now reflected on our campaign goal. THANK YOU SO MUCH to Samesun &amp; community for the huge support! <br/> </p>

<h3><strong>What is ""Community Agriculture""?</strong></h3>
<p><br/>Community Agriculture (CA) is a system that <strong>bridges the divide</strong> between farmers and consumers, and between the city and the country. In the CA model we ARE the farmers AND the consumers, and we are city dwellers AND country lovers! Each of our 50 CA members come to the farm one weekend a month throughout the planting, growing and harvesting season. <strong>We work together to grow food for ourselves and contribute to the broader community.</strong> We also build community by sharing meals, telling stories around the fire, creating art, playing music and dancing</p>
<p>As the vegetables and fruits ripen, members harvest each weekend and the ripe, fresh, organic food is delivered to drop off points in the city for the other members to pick up. <strong>In the 2017 growing season our 1 acre garden fed over 70 people weekly</strong> and provided fresh food donations to a variety of community organizations. In addition, our community had an oasis in which to leave behind the stress and isolation of the city, recharge, reconnect, and have fun!</p>
<p>It’s an extraordinary dream coming true!</p>
<p><strong>Community Agriculture is a replicable model</strong> that allows city dwellers to use nearby land to grow food and build community. Join us in the movement towards food sustainability through community-led agriculture. We would love to share the experience and inspire other communities to create their own version of Abundance Community Farm. <br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">​“<i>My family and I LOVE Abundance farm! We go as often as possible in the spring and summer weekends to get deeper into nature. We can relax, unwind, get our hands in the earth, learn to grow our own food, swim in the river with friends and family, dance in the barn, share our talents, develop new skills and come together in supportive community. Children are growing up here and lifelong friendships are strengthening. Our dreams of building sustainable models are manifesting at Abundance Farm.</i>”<strong>~ Maggie Blue, Community Agriculture Member</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Who Are We?</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>The founder of the farm, Amir Niroumand, sold his house in Vancouver, BC, Canada in 2016 and bought the land that became <i>Abundance Community Farm</i>. He was part of a community of cultural creatives in Vancouver that grew local organic food in their backyards and created cultural activities and events in their living rooms. He trusted that having land close to the city would inspire his network to <strong>take their care for the environment</strong> and passion for culture and community to the next level. The response has been greater than he’d ever imagined!</p>
<p>The farm is located on 40-acres of land in Agassiz, BC, 1.5 hours east of Vancouver. There are 5 permanent residents living on the farm, and a network of Community Agriculture members who live in the Metro Vancouver and <strong>farm-share one weekend monthly</strong> to grow food, connect to nature, and build community. We care about our footprint on the planet and believe that our local community-based action is a powerful path to global change. We strive to model a new cultural paradigm that is based on <strong>collaboration, sharing resources, and healthy relationship to the land</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>

<strong>Our Recent Successes</strong><br/> </h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“<i>For me, the Abundance Community Farm is dream come true!  A welcoming place where community gathers to work with the land, learn to grow, savour and preserve food and celebrate with laughter and dance. My participation in the CA program at the Farm has enabled me to slow down and nourish my body and spirit.</i>” <strong>~ Jenna Card, Community Agriculture Member</strong><br/> </p>
<p>We’ve had a wild success in our first season in 2017. Our garden has been bountiful and our community has thrived to an extent beyond our imagination. Here are some highlights:<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>Organic Farming</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Cultivated one acre of veggies and planted a one-acre food forest comprised of 150 fruit and nut trees</li>
<li>Grew over 40 varieties of vegetables and harvested thousands of pounds of food</li>
<li>Provided delicious ripe organic produce to ~100 members, neighbours, and community organization every week of the growing season</li>
<li>Hosted several canning and preserving events</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<br/><strong>Community Development</strong>
</h3>

<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>New initiatives always come with risks and ours is no exception. The main challenge with community-based initiatives is navigating through the conflicts that arise. One of our farm residents is a communication facilitator. He takes the lead on resolving our conflicts. <strong>We're proud of how we have moved through our differences</strong> and have made collective decisions that everyone supports. It's not always easy to work through conflict, but we accept that conflict is a normal part of community, and we are committed to addressing it to the best of our abilities.</p>
<p>Regulatory issues are another challenge. There are no bylaws for our model of Community Agriculture where a group of people live in the city and farm on weekends. We are trying to fit our model as much as possible to established bylaws, and also work with regulatory bodies to incorporate new regulations that are more supportive of Community Agriculture. We are not yet financially sustainable. We have sources of funding that have supported our operation, and we have created professional partnerships for hosting retreats as part of our income. This fundraiser is a critical step that enables us to upgrade our facilities in order to become financially sustainable.</p>

<h3>Are You Ready for Real Change?</h3>
<p><i>Racebridge LLC</i> is a brand new online media publishing company that offers premium content on cultural diversity, equality, and unity in America. We represent a huge step toward the next generation of leaders who believe in equality and moreover, want to put action behind those beliefs.</p>
<p>Our mission is to connect people from various cultures and subcultures through the use of shared stories, personal connections, and experiences. We will primarily feature, highlight, and promote people of color and women, but our main purpose is to bridge the gap between the human race as we head toward total fairness in America.</p>
<p>Our content will entail initiatives, statistics, news, solution-oriented proposals, healthy debates, inspiring stories, celebrations of cultures, and more. We are at the most critical point in world history. We ask that you help <i>Racebridge </i>positively influence American's hearts and minds, as we continue to progress by taking unprecedented action!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As a contributor to our startup launch fund, you will provide the core foundation to uplift our mission and push our media into the world. Your generosity supports <i>Racebridge’s</i> ability to advertise and promote media, produce high quality content, and hire team members.</p>
<p>*Contributors who donate <strong>$50 or more</strong> will receive a <i>Racebridge</i> bumper sticker to show your pride as an advocate.</p>
<p>*Contributors who donate <strong>$100 or more</strong> will receive the bumper sticker, <strong>plus</strong> a <i>Racebridge</i> hat, <strong>plus</strong> the option of being listed as a <i>Racebridge Hero</i> on our website once it’s live.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise <strong>$25,000+</strong>, and if this is accomplished, we will be able to produce a larger volume of content, add operational expenses (i.e. software), hire virtual assistants, and advertise during the startup phase of the company.</p>
<p>We appreciate all supporters and every contribution makes a difference.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here is the difference your contribution will make:</p>
<p>1. <strong>People Are Tired of Divisive Content</strong> - Some media companies have a business goal of acquiring attention at all costs, even at the cost of negatively portraying certain cultures. They may be unaware, or they may not care. Either way, <i>Racebridge</i> promotes diversity even when it's uncomfortable in order to showcase cultural differences as a valuable thing to cherish.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Media Shapes Perceptions</strong> - A white mother in the suburbs is scared of black people because she has no black friends. A black person in the hood is uncomfortable around white people because they automatically assume white people don't care about them. Bridging the cultural gap between officers and communities, men and women, black and white, gay and straight, are all a part of our mission. We make the effort to show positive relationships, so that people become comfortable with others who are different than themselves.</p>
<p>3. <strong>The Topic Of Race Will Never Disappear</strong> - Avoiding race makes it more of a sensitive topic, because at the end of the day, we all know it’s there. So instead, let’s talk openly, honestly, and respectfully. That’s when we understand how to create actionable change, so everyone feels comfortable and accepted.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Every Side Has A Story</strong> - People are quick to judge without seeking to understand first. We push the opposite agenda. You’re free to judge and completely disagree <i>after</i> a person explains their story, but it’s important to put emotions aside and think with logical empathy first.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge at <i>Racebridge</i> is the lack of capital to expand our reach and operations. We’re determined to improve the quality and volume of content in regard to cultural connections and making a difference in America’s perception of race, gender, sexual orientation, and more. </p>
<p>If you are unable to donate, we just ask that you help promote our mission by following our social media accounts @racebridge and sharing our page!</p>

The COVID-19 pandemic has destroyed the con scene, especially the small creators who depend on it for income. </p><p><br/>We have always wanted to create a safe, all-ages-friendly queer space for people from all over the LGBTQIA+ spectrum. As nerds and con kids since we were knee high to a grasshopper, we felt we’d be best at making that space for the nerdy side.</p><p><br/>Te and Be from the Atomic Pixies started talking with friends, especially their queer friends in the nerdy art community, about laying the grounds for a new convention in 2017. We chose the name Dandy Con both for the historical reference to Dandies, fashionable men of a certain mindset, and because dandelions are an amazing analogy—They’re a beneficial weed that provide food and medicine, make their (biological) community better, bring brightness, beauty, and resilience everywhere they go...and never get the respect they deserve.</p><p><br/>Seems fitting.</p><p><br/>We want this to be a place for all. The queer community is amazing, but we still lack a lot of places that aren’t tied to the night scene. Places that are welcoming to all ages, families, and anyone who might not feel comfortable in a bar. And recently the nerd community, on every level, has been exploring new life and new horizons...of course we want to take that journey with it, with these two communities, intertwined. While we were planting these seeds...the world turned on its head.</p><p> </p><p>Now we want to make something new.

Check out Dandycon.com for those opportunities and more. Maker Market and Community Garden open Sunday, May 17th for submission.All presenters will also have Ko-fis available where you can tip them directly during the event if you appreciate their content!  Where did this idea come from?If you have blissfully been in the woods for the last 6 months or so, well, thank you for checking out our campaign first thing, and I’m very, very sorry. The COVID-19 pandemic has destroyed the con scene, especially the small creators who depend on it for income. We have always wanted to create a safe, all-ages-friendly queer space for people from all over the LGBTQIA+ spectrum. As nerds and con kids since we were knee high to a grasshopper, we felt we’d be best at making that space for the nerdy side.Te and Be from the Atomic Pixies started talking with friends, especially their queer friends in the nerdy art community, about laying the grounds for a new convention in 2017. We chose the name Dandy Con both for the historical reference to Dandies, fashionable men of a certain mindset, and because dandelions are an amazing analogy—They’re a beneficial weed that provide food and medicine, make their (biological) community better, bring brightness, beauty, and resilience everywhere they go...and never get the respect they deserve.Seems fitting.We want this to be a place for all. The queer community is amazing, but we still lack a lot of places that aren’t tied to the night scene. Places that are welcoming to all ages, families, and anyone who might not feel comfortable in a bar. And recently the nerd community, on every level, has been exploring new life and new horizons...of course we want to take that journey with it, with these two communities, intertwined. While we were planting these seeds...the world turned on its head. Now we want to make something new. To dig those roots deep into the soil and create Dandy Con as something unique. Help us make Dandy Con blossom!",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

Today, we want to organise these events in order to spread the message that it’s possible to heal. Today more than ever, it is vital to break the taboo around sex, consent and mental health.

This film is part of the current global movement for gender equality and for mental health. Our goal is to allow people from different social and political background to start talking about consent.

Working closely with Rape Crisis Scotland, there is evidence that when a trauma survivor hears another’s story, it shows them they are not alone. The world becomes one step safer.

Many people reached out to us after, telling us the film helped them open up about their own trauma or believe they could heal and stop relying to medication to cope with what they went through.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">This film will show that despite the pain and the suffering one experiences, there is always a way to reach out to others and be part of someone’s recovery!

<p>This idea came to Irondale co-founder Terry Greiss after watching the video of Eric Garner's fatal 2014 encounter with police officers in Staten Island. Like so many of us - he felt enraged: </p>
<p><i>""I kept seeing people not talking to each other, not looking at each other and the tragedy that evolved because of that. So, in my anger about this, I wrote a letter to the police commissioner and I said: This is what we do and I think you need it.""</i>    (NPR, Jeff Lunden). </p>
<p>To the company's surprise - the NYPD replied immediately and ""To Protect, Serve, and Understand"" was born. </p>

<p>Over a period of<strong> ten weeks</strong>, seven officers and seven community members come together to eat, talk, and play together. They learn to improvise, tell their own stories, and <strong>“step into each other’s shoes.” </strong></p>
<p>The workshops culminate in original and spontaneous public performances that show what can come from mutual trust and empathetic understanding.    </p>

<p>After dinner, no matter how heated things get, the company jumps into the work.</p>
<p>The work consists of improvisation games and actor techniques all taught by Irondale's teaching Artists. <strong>We laugh, we sing, we get silly, and we confront difficult topics thru the art. </strong></p>
<p>We use these improvisation and storytelling techniques to help participants take on the roles of individuals who are unfamiliar to them. Participants are asked to interview people in their communities and to use their personal stories.

<h3>About Irondale Ensemble: 35 years of Arts Activism</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Irondale Ensemble is one of the premier and longest-established companies of its kind in the United States. Since our founding, in 1983, we have created over 60 theater productions in New York City, including 13 original works created collaboratively by the company. Our work in theaters and in the community is held in the highest esteem and, as one of the pioneers in the field of arts education, we have used the art of theater to enhance teaching and learning for thousands of students, teachers and “at-risk” youth. Our STEM to STEAM program now reaches 400 high school science, math and engineering students, using theater to teach them presentation skills. Over the years we have toured to Russia, created programs for AIDS affected children in South Africa, and directed at the Drama Centre London, a premier British training program. Irondale is the recipient of commendations from the Brooklyn Borough President, the Otto Award for Humanitarian and Political Theater, and the CINE Award for Best Educational Video. The ensemble won the Grand Prix at the St. Petersburg International Theater Festival for its production You Can’t Win. We helped create the Network of Ensemble Theaters, now the preeminent association of artist-driven theaters in the country, and the Downtown Brooklyn Arts Alliance, and served as a model in the creation of five theater companies in the US and Canada.</p>

</div></div>","In 2015, Irondale invited the New York Police Department to join them in developing a program that would use theatrical improvisation to build communication and empathy between officers and the communities they are charged to protect and serve.
This idea came to Irondale co-founder Terry Greiss after watching the video of Eric Garner's fatal 2014 encounter with police officers in Staten Island. Like so many of us - he felt enraged: 
""I kept seeing people not talking to each other, not looking at each other and the tragedy that evolved because of that. So, in my anger about this, I wrote a letter to the police commissioner and I said: This is what we do and I think you need it.""    (NPR, Jeff Lunden). 
To the company's surprise - the NYPD replied immediately and ""To Protect, Serve, and Understand"" was born. 

 

Over a period of ten weeks, seven officers and seven community members come together to eat, talk, and play together. They learn to improvise, tell their own stories, and “step into each other’s shoes.” 
The workshops culminate in original and spontaneous public performances that show what can come from mutual trust and empathetic understanding.    

 


Each workshop begins with the entire group sitting down together to have a meal. This is a vital part of the experience. How often do we really get to sit down and hear other perspectives on topics that are very hot in the world right now? Topics we need to hear another point of view on but rarely do.  
 
Take A Walk in My Shoes... 
 

After dinner, no matter how heated things get, the company jumps into the work.
The work consists of improvisation games and actor techniques all taught by Irondale's teaching Artists. We laugh, we sing, we get silly, and we confront difficult topics thru the art. 
We use these improvisation and storytelling techniques to help participants take on the roles of individuals who are unfamiliar to them. Participants are asked to interview people in their communities and to use their personal stories. Cops interview civilians; civilians interview cops.  And then they play each other. By speaking, moving, and thinking as another person, and ultimately making someone else’s story their own, they develop true understanding that leads to a heightened level of trust and cooperation. Participants are given the tools to appreciate and honor the other person’s experience. 
 

 
We Believe Communication & Empathy is what the World Needs Now
This program addresses one of the timeliest issues in our society today: the relationship between police officers and the individuals they protect and serve. We believe that fear and misconceptions about the “other” stand in the way of achieving understanding between people who need to trust and respect each other in order for society to function safely and equitably.

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489006450/bgdusgm0k1o49upwrold.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Creative Justice was launched by 4Culture in 2015 as an arts-based alternative to incarceration for youth in King County, Washington. Rather than being locked in jail, court-involved young people remain in the community where they participate in 3-4 month project sessions with mentor artists whose work is grounded in social justice. Through multi-disciplinary arts experiences and community-centered dialog, the youth consider many of the root causes of incarceration like racism and other forms of oppression. At the end of each session, they use art to amplify their voices and promote change, leading and producing community based actions in which they offer their own ideas, vision, and creativity to address the issues that most impact them.</p>
<p>In exchange for their creative work, Creative Justice youth receive community service credit and stipends that help pay court fines. Program participation is also used as mitigation in their cases, with benefits ranging as far as full case dismissal. The impact of the experience, however, is much farther reaching than court outcomes alone. Participants develop authentic relationships with supportive mentors, are introduced to the artist-activist community, and are encouraged to use their leadership skills to bring about meaningful social change. In these ways, Creative Justice offers a new vision of what justice can be, reminding the court system that secure confinement is not necessary.</p>
<p>The Creative Justice Youth Leadership Team provides a way for program participants to engage with mentors long after their project sessions end via monthly gatherings and special projects. These emerging leaders are helping guide the program’s evolution, continuing to contribute to the dialog about juvenile justice reform through their individual and collective creativity. Leadership development training opportunities are coupled with public presentations of art, pop-up exhibits, panel discussions, and community workshops.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489004484/wf0kei7jqm2xtpphzuoz.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p><i>Creative Justice participants initiated the #FreeTheYouth campaign with music, a video, and a t-shirt design. The message serves as anthem for the Youth Leadership Team's upcoming workshop at Open Engagement.</i></p>
<p><br/><strong>About Open Engagement 2017 </strong></p>
<p>Open Engagement (OE) is the largest artist-led conference dedicated to expanding the dialogue around, and creating a site of care for, the field of socially engaged art. Founded in 2007, OE has evolved into an unparalleled hub for practitioners and audiences to assemble. OE supports emerging and established artists and organizers, highlights the voices of students alongside professionals, and collaborates closely with national institutions to further the networks of support for socially engaged art. OE is committed to the power of art to enact radical social change.</p>
<p>Too often, artists and activists working across a wide spectrum of issues ranging from immigration, food and environmental justice, urban planning, gentrification, police violence, and many other vital and timely reckonings are isolated from one another.</p>
<p>In 2017, OE is focused on the theme of JUSTICE. The conference will take place at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a constellation of sites across the city. How can artists contribute to the work for justice? How can these movements be more effective with the work of artists? This conference is intended to break down these silos, serve as an educational resource, facilitate crucial dialogue, and provide opportunities to highlight successful artistic and community engagements. OE is a site to learn from one another and to provide opportunities for attendees to access valuable skills and tools that push and support their work in embedded contexts.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why This Campaign?</strong></p>
<p>Open Engagement participation presents a unique leadership development opportunity for our youth, but the cost cannot be funded through the Creative Justice budget. We are launching this campaign to raise the funds needed to cover project expenses, travel costs and accommodations for the youth and chaperones. Every dollar you donate (up to our goal) will directly support youth participation in the Open Engagement conference. Should we surpass our goal, any additional funds will help maintain the activities of our currently under-funded program.</p>
<p>To thank you for your support, we have an array of gifts from digital downloads of youth art to #FreeTheYouth bracelets and T-shirts, and even some cool swag generously donated by our friends at Sub Pop Records! We'll be posting new perks throughout the campaign, with surprises along the way.</p>

Creative Justice was launched by 4Culture in 2015 as an arts-based alternative to incarceration for youth in King County, Washington. Rather than being locked in jail, court-involved young people remain in the community where they participate in 3-4 month project sessions with mentor artists whose work is grounded in social justice. Through multi-disciplinary arts experiences and community-centered dialog, the youth consider many of the root causes of incarceration like racism and other forms of oppression. At the end of each session, they use art to amplify their voices and promote change, leading and producing community based actions in which they offer their own ideas, vision, and creativity to address the issues that most impact them.
In exchange for their creative work, Creative Justice youth receive community service credit and stipends that help pay court fines. Program participation is also used as mitigation in their cases, with benefits ranging as far as full case dismissal. The impact of the experience, however, is much farther reaching than court outcomes alone. Participants develop authentic relationships with supportive mentors, are introduced to the artist-activist community, and are encouraged to use their leadership skills to bring about meaningful social change. In these ways, Creative Justice offers a new vision of what justice can be, reminding the court system that secure confinement is not necessary.
The Creative Justice Youth Leadership Team provides a way for program participants to engage with mentors long after their project sessions end via monthly gatherings and special projects. These emerging leaders are helping guide the program’s evolution, continuing to contribute to the dialog about juvenile justice reform through their individual and collective creativity. Leadership development training opportunities are coupled with public presentations of art, pop-up exhibits, panel discussions, and community workshops.
Creative Justice participants initiated the #FreeTheYouth campaign with music, a video, and a t-shirt design. The message serves as anthem for the Youth Leadership Team's upcoming workshop at Open Engagement.
About Open Engagement 2017 
Open Engagement (OE) is the largest artist-led conference dedicated to expanding the dialogue around, and creating a site of care for, the field of socially engaged art. Founded in 2007, OE has evolved into an unparalleled hub for practitioners and audiences to assemble. OE supports emerging and established artists and organizers, highlights the voices of students alongside professionals, and collaborates closely with national institutions to further the networks of support for socially engaged art. OE is committed to the power of art to enact radical social change.
Too often, artists and activists working across a wide spectrum of issues ranging from immigration, food and environmental justice, urban planning, gentrification, police violence, and many other vital and timely reckonings are isolated from one another.
In 2017, OE is focused on the theme of JUSTICE. The conference will take place at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a constellation of sites across the city. How can artists contribute to the work for justice? How can these movements be more effective with the work of artists? This conference is intended to break down these silos, serve as an educational resource, facilitate crucial dialogue, and provide opportunities to highlight successful artistic and community engagements. OE is a site to learn from one another and to provide opportunities for attendees to access valuable skills and tools that push and support their work in embedded contexts.
 
Why This Campaign?
Open Engagement participation presents a unique leadership development opportunity for our youth, but the cost cannot be funded through the Creative Justice budget. We are launching this campaign to raise the funds needed to cover project expenses, travel costs and accommodations for the youth and chaperones. Every dollar you donate (up to our goal) will directly support youth participation in the Open Engagement conference. Should we surpass our goal, any additional funds will help maintain the activities of our currently under-funded program.
To thank you for your support, we have an array of gifts from digital downloads of youth art to #FreeTheYouth bracelets and T-shirts, and even some cool swag generously donated by our friends at Sub Pop Records! We'll be posting new perks throughout the campaign, with surprises along the way.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

The damage prevented the car from being shipped by rail and it was placed in a siding near Queensgate Yard in Cincinnati, OH. The bad ordered caboose would end up staying in that disused siding over 10 years.</p><p>Earlier this summer officials at CSX Transportation reached out to Cincinnati Scenic Railway to save 904137 which was slated to be removed by a scrapper. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the nonprofit organization was able to pull together enough funding to rescue the historic caboose. Working with Case Towing, it was transported at the eleventh hour to the Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad in Lebanon, OH.</p><p>Despite being exposed to vandals and the elements for over a decade, 904137 is in remarkably good condition retaining nearly all of its original interior fixtures. It will make an amazing addition to Cincinnati Scenic Railway's expanding collection of operating rolling stock.</p><p>If parts can be sourced in a timely manner and funding goals achieved, volunteers expect to have the caboose fully restored within 6-12 months. The caboose will be used as a shove platform in freight and passenger excursion service.</p><p> </p><h3>About Cincinnati Scenic Railway</h3><p>Cincinnati Scenic Railway is a 501(3)c nonprofit organization operating the Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad and the Ohio Rail Experience.</p><p>The organization is proud to fund nearly all of it's restoration efforts out the fare-box while serving nearly 55,000 passengers a year.</p><p>The Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad, is a successful shortline tourist railroad based in Lebanon, OH.

We plan to complete the following work as a part of the restoration:</p><p>- Replace windows damaged by vandals.</p><p>- Replace the missing door on the ""B"" end.</p><p>- Underneath, a lot of repair work is needed to get the car into revenue service, including, but not limited to: replacing the damaged self centering device, changing out the brake valves, and completing repairs to the draft gear assembly.</p><p>- Restore the original diesel oil fired stove.</p><p>- Patch holes in interior made by an investigating scrapper.</p><p>- Paint the caboose exterior.</p><p> </p><h3>Operation</h3><p>C&amp;O 904137 will be used by Cincinnati Scenic Railway on their Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad in Lebanon, OH</p><p>It will be used as a shove platform in freight and passenger excursion service. The public will have the opportunity to ride in the caboose on passenger trains.</p><p>The LM&amp;M Railroad operates 5 miles of track from Lebanon, OH to Hageman Junction in partnership with the Cincinnati Railway Company.

Working with Case Towing, it was transported at the eleventh hour to the Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad in Lebanon, OH.Despite being exposed to vandals and the elements for over a decade, 904137 is in remarkably good condition retaining nearly all of its original interior fixtures. It will make an amazing addition to Cincinnati Scenic Railway's expanding collection of operating rolling stock.If parts can be sourced in a timely manner and funding goals achieved, volunteers expect to have the caboose fully restored within 6-12 months. The caboose will be used as a shove platform in freight and passenger excursion service. About Cincinnati Scenic RailwayCincinnati Scenic Railway is a 501(3)c nonprofit organization operating the Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad and the Ohio Rail Experience.The organization is proud to fund nearly all of it's restoration efforts out the fare-box while serving nearly 55,000 passengers a year.The Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad, is a successful shortline tourist railroad based in Lebanon, OH. The Ohio Rail Experience, is a one-of-a-kind operator of rare mileage excursions over nearly 400 miles of track.Cincinnati Scenic Railway is home to 3 vintage EMD locomotives and over 25 historic railcars.The organization is actively fundraising for the acquisition of Chessie System B&O GP30 6955. More information on that project can be found here: https://tinyurl.com/y4l8vjl8#savethechessie Our PlansRestoration The caboose is in great shape but needs more than just a little TLC. Over $7,000 has already been invested into preserving C&O 904137, but we need your help to complete the project. We plan to complete the following work as a part of the restoration:- Replace windows damaged by vandals.- Replace the missing door on the ""B"" end.- Underneath, a lot of repair work is needed to get the car into revenue service, including, but not limited to: replacing the damaged self centering device, changing out the brake valves, and completing repairs to the draft gear assembly.- Restore the original diesel oil fired stove.- Patch holes in interior made by an investigating scrapper.- Paint the caboose exterior. OperationC&O 904137 will be used by Cincinnati Scenic Railway on their Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad in Lebanon, OHIt will be used as a shove platform in freight and passenger excursion service. The public will have the opportunity to ride in the caboose on passenger trains.The LM&M Railroad operates 5 miles of track from Lebanon, OH to Hageman Junction in partnership with the Cincinnati Railway Company. The railroad is a popular regional attraction with well patronized passenger excursions running year-round. Use of Funds Beyond GoalFunds raised beyond the $2,800 goal and any unspent funds will benefit Cincinnati Scenic Railway's campaign to purchase and restore Chessie System B&O GP30 6955.

<h3><strong>Overview </strong></h3>
<p>Memory Kaleidoscope is a delightful card game that allows us to connect with families, friends, coworkers and strangers. The artwork featured on the cards helps us surface big and small moments of our lives. Players will deepen their understanding of one another through listening and discussing the memories shared. The game rewards those with an open heart and a curious mind.</p>
<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p>We are dreamers from <a href=""http://www.designdreamlab.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Design Dream Lab</a>. We are a non-profit creative collective based in NYC striving to bring positive impacts to the local community by applying the empathy-based Design Thinking mindset. We bring our passion and love for humanity to everything we build, with everyone we connect, and to all our projects. The dreamers who are working on this game have a lot of heart, and they also come with expertise in game design, user research, cultural education, behavioral therapy, and community building.</p>

<h3><strong>The Backstory</strong></h3>
<p>Developing this game over the past 14 months has been a labor of love. It all began with a simple email. On September 11, 2017, Design Dream Lab got an email inquiry from the Queens Public Library in New York City:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>“We’d like to build a ... game for families to play together during the holidays...to introduce story sharing as a fun activity and (hopefully) begin a family’s dialog ... to not only sharing their heritage within their own family, but sharing it with their library’s local history collections.”</i></p>
<p>Design Dream Lab members (AKA dreamers) got together and created a game to be played during holidays with family. However, during the development of the game, we didn’t have enough families to test out the game. So we tested with different groups- with complete strangers, with college interns, with our neighbors, and with our co-workers. </p>
<p>And something magical happened. Strangers, colleagues, and neighbors began sharing stories of their childhood, their recent travels, and memories they haven’t shared in a long time with anyone. And those memories connected people in such a meaningful and delightful ways.</p>
<p>That is when we decided to expand the reach of this game to communities beyond families.</p>
<p>We discovered that sharing memories, listening, curiosity, and empathy - which are essential ingredients in playing this game - could bring people together in such meaningful and surprising ways.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573876733/c25cnr5s4btw7fptf2qk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Why It Works</strong></h3>
<p>Conventional conversations often make us focus on being right as opposed to hearing others and being heard. In developing this game, we asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>How might we create a safe space for the storyteller to share stories beyond the surface level topics?</li>
<li>How might we encourage listeners to stay curious about the person who shares the story without judgement?</li>
<li>How might we allow the players to see the connections with other players beyond their own stories?</li>
<li>How might we reflect on the stories shared and appreciate being together?</li>
</ul>
<p>You will find the answers by playing this card game. It was developed to bring us together as human beings - with curiosity, with authenticity, with empathy, with connections, and with deep gratitude for the memories players share with one another.</p>
<p>We playtested this game with a variety of people and settings - with families at a street fair, with seniors at senior centers, with college students at an orientation, with leaders at startups.</p>
<p>We heard repeatedly that Memory Kaleidoscope helped players connect with one another in a way that felt fun, safe, intimate, meaningful, and satisfying.</p>
<p>People got to know one another through their shared memories and had a sense of relatedness when common themes arose.  Family members who have known each other for 20+ years also learned something new about one another that never surfaced before in years of interaction.</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>There are few games that encourage people to share their memories while cultivating genuine curiosity about others. Knowing others through their lived experience helps us form deeper connections with one another.

<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>

<p>We hope to focus our effort so that Memory Kaleidoscope can reach those who can benefit from it most.

Recognising our effort and commitment to engage the children with very limited resources, the neighbourhood coffeeshop has stepped up and offered to sponsor a shop space for the exhibition.

The children are also guided to observe their environment and appreciate their surroundings in ways that people have forgotten to notice, inspiring and connecting others as they move around the neighbourhood taking photographs. For a few weeks in December, Isabelle has been become a familiar ‘Lady in Pink’ figure in Lengkok Bahru as she visits daily to take pictures using her own camera and portable darkroom. for a few weeks in December. In the process of this pilot experience, more than 10 cameras were made and over 30 photographs were developed with over 15 children, many of whom have already been engaged in 3Pumpkins’ community development programme Let’s Go PLay Outside!, a joint partnership with South Central Community Family Service Centre since April 2019. Our programmes are carefully designed to build upon one another to enable sustainability in the long run.Our work also encourages the community to step up. Recognising our effort and commitment to engage the children with very limited resources, the neighbourhood coffeeshop has stepped up and offered to sponsor a shop space for the exhibition. This signifies a positive start to how members of the community, or the community eco-system, can come together to create a warm and inspiring place for our children to grow up in.  Risks & ChallengesThe project will only work if children decide to get involved and take the time to go around, create cameras and develop pictures. It is unlikely, but possible, that only few children get involved in the project. While we aim for an impact over at least 40 of the neighbourhood’s children, even one or 2 participants can make a difference. The pilot experiment shows that many of the children are excited by the project and will likely come and visit out of curiosity, will make cameras, and use the dark room more than once. Eventually, we are confident that we can create a library of over 100 photographs of the neighborhood, people, bicycles, playground, building, trees, communities… Other Ways You Can HelpDo you like the campaign but cannot contribute financially? You can still support this campaign by sharing widely! This will help the project become known, and make it more meaningful. Children will be very excited to learn that their project and photographs are reaching not just beyond their neighbourhood to reach the rest of Singapore, but hopefully throughout the world too.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Since this is such a major undertaking, we've had to set aside our art for the past 4 months and have just been hemorrhaging our savings. </p>
<p>What's made a huge impact in the short time we've owned Churchill is the number of people who've volunteered their time and talents.

With <i>7 bedrooms, 2 kitchens, a library common space, an outdoor patio plus an acre of green space totally secluded from the road</i>, the Lodge will make it possible for us to host all kinds of groups for residencies, retreats, workshops, and special events. This space will be designed to host a wide array of needs, including but not limited to: band rehearsals; artist residencies (writers, studio artists, dancers, et al); team-building for professional development; skill shares and educational workshops; special celebrations, events, and gatherings for families and friends. Each room will be furnished and equipped with love and care that reflects the rich history and culture of our creative community that surrounds this space.</p>
<p><strong>the GROUNDS - </strong>Our campus offers an escape from city life and an immersive opportunity to connect with nature as a source of inspiration. As stewards of this land, we have cultivated gardens &amp; orchards between the banks of the 10-Mile River and our backyard creek. With a commitment to environmental conservation, we honor the traditional territory of the Lenni-Lenape tribe by growing native plants to encourage cross - pollination of species &amp; ideas. Guests will be invited to learn about the native ecosystems and participate in its cultivation, enjoying seasonal activities like tapping maple syrup or harvesting produce from the gardens.</p>
<p><strong>the BARN -</strong> Our 19th century barn found new life as a DIY recording studio in the coldest, darkest days of COVID.

<h2>
<strong>Hi, I’m Marc, </strong><strong>of Buffalo Bike Tours. </strong>
</h2>
<p>As a Buffalo Native who recently returned, I was blown away by how much the city has changed and all there is to see and do. Buffalo is home to a resurgent culture, world-class food, an amazing biking community, and some of the most endearing people anywhere.</p>
<p>While I love being back in my hometown, I noticed that most local tour offerings left a lot to be desired. Downtown was full of party bikes, double decker buses, and dry architectural tours – but I saw a need to create a tour company that would stand out with true authenticity. I had no money or investors – just passion for two of my favorite things: <strong>bikes and Buffalo.</strong><br/><br/>I started leading free, donation-based tours. I wrote songs, brought poems to read, shared jokes, and showed people some of my favorite places while breaking down some of Buffalo’s negative perceptions. Much to my surprise, it worked! <strong>More than 250+ people showed up</strong> and we realized just maybe we're on to something.</p>
<h2><strong>2019 promises to be much, much bigger. </strong></h2>
<p><strong>This year we're excited to partner with <a href=""https://gobikebuffalo.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GObike</a>, our bike advocacy organization, to offer bike rentals.</strong> We're taking 8 bikes destined for the landfill – and going to be refurbishing them and decking them out with decals, lights, and helmets. Tourists and locals alike will then be able to check them out from <a href=""https://hostelbuffalo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buffalo-Niagara Hostel</a>, where all tours will depart from and return to.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552838853/vljoftwfz9a2dghwuiqr.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554996800/podtttbgvwa2kjti1hvy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>
<strong style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Moreover, we're offering more tours at more times, including</strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">:</span>
</h2>
<p><a href=""https://www.buffalobiketours.com/bsidesride/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>B/Sides Ride: Buffalo’s Unsung History</strong></a><br/>Explore the deep cuts from Buffalo history – from civil rights to workers’ unrest – and how these movements have shaped the city today.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.buffalobiketours.com/asidesride"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>A/Sides Ride: The Best of Buffalo</strong></a><br/>Bike through parks while learning about Buffalo’s heavy hitters – from wild Erie Canal stories to the Pan American Exposition and the city’s world-class architecture.<br/><br/><a href=""https://www.buffalobiketours.com/thewingride"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>The Wing Ride: The Classic Buffalo Foodie Experience</strong></a><br/>Earn your wings on this fresh trail through Buffalo’s tastiest restaurants and watering holes – with samples at 5 wide-ranging eateries.</p>

<h2>What your backing means.</h2>
<p>Our tours provide one more reason to stay in Buffalo. It is our aim to get people exploring our many great neighborhoods. We want people not just to come to Buffalo as a stopping point on their way to Niagara Falls but to extend their stays. This means more support for our local business community – and all done on bikes!</p>

<h2><strong>We're asking for community buy-in.</strong></h2>
<p>In order to make our needed leap, we'll need at least $5,000. This will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,500 - for fully refurbishing a fleet of 8 bikes.</li>
<li>$1,000 - for a lean online advertising budget.</li>
<li>$1,000 - for collateral including rack cards, posters, business cards, and website.</li>
<li>$500 - for legal and incorporating expenses.</li>
</ul>

</ul></div></div>","Hi, I’m Marc, of Buffalo Bike Tours. 

As a Buffalo Native who recently returned, I was blown away by how much the city has changed and all there is to see and do. Buffalo is home to a resurgent culture, world-class food, an amazing biking community, and some of the most endearing people anywhere.
While I love being back in my hometown, I noticed that most local tour offerings left a lot to be desired. Downtown was full of party bikes, double decker buses, and dry architectural tours – but I saw a need to create a tour company that would stand out with true authenticity. I had no money or investors – just passion for two of my favorite things: bikes and Buffalo.I started leading free, donation-based tours. I wrote songs, brought poems to read, shared jokes, and showed people some of my favorite places while breaking down some of Buffalo’s negative perceptions. Much to my surprise, it worked! More than 250+ people showed up and we realized just maybe we're on to something.
2019 promises to be much, much bigger. 
This year we're excited to partner with GObike, our bike advocacy organization, to offer bike rentals. We're taking 8 bikes destined for the landfill – and going to be refurbishing them and decking them out with decals, lights, and helmets. Tourists and locals alike will then be able to check them out from Buffalo-Niagara Hostel, where all tours will depart from and return to.


Moreover, we're offering more tours at more times, including:

B/Sides Ride: Buffalo’s Unsung HistoryExplore the deep cuts from Buffalo history – from civil rights to workers’ unrest – and how these movements have shaped the city today.
A/Sides Ride: The Best of BuffaloBike through parks while learning about Buffalo’s heavy hitters – from wild Erie Canal stories to the Pan American Exposition and the city’s world-class architecture.The Wing Ride: The Classic Buffalo Foodie ExperienceEarn your wings on this fresh trail through Buffalo’s tastiest restaurants and watering holes – with samples at 5 wide-ranging eateries.
East Meets West Ride: An International Foodie ExperienceAn epic meal on bikes connecting the city’s history to its current immigrant communities through the lens of its culinary traditions.
What your backing means.
Our tours provide one more reason to stay in Buffalo. It is our aim to get people exploring our many great neighborhoods. We want people not just to come to Buffalo as a stopping point on their way to Niagara Falls but to extend their stays. This means more support for our local business community – and all done on bikes!
 
We're asking for community buy-in.
In order to make our needed leap, we'll need at least $5,000. This will cover the following:

$2,500 - for fully refurbishing a fleet of 8 bikes.
$1,000 - for a lean online advertising budget.
$1,000 - for collateral including rack cards, posters, business cards, and website.
$500 - for legal and incorporating expenses.


What's in it for me?
We have some great perks for your support – including advance tickets to tours, locally-made merch, and incentives such as naming rights. So, be a part of our story, and save your spot on a tour before they fill up. Every bit helps!
When do we get to party?
The campaign will run for a month and culminate with Buffalo Bike Tours May’den Voyage on May 1, from 5:30PM-7:30PM, departing from GObike Community Workshop (98 Colvin Avenue). Everyone is welcome, and bike floats and costumes are encouraged.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Who are we?</u></h2>
<p>The Falls of Clyde was built in 1878 (in Port Glasgow) and was one of eight sister ships named after the waterfalls of Scotland. She is now the sole survivor and is currently afloat in Honolulu, Hawaii. However, she is more than just a piece of Scottish history and heritage, she is a testament to the power of Scottish Shipbuilding as, after over 139 years, she is still steady and still floating.</p>
<p>But, there's a problem, she has fallen into disrepair and the Hawaiian authorities had planned to sink her. Our Glasgow based group 'Save Falls of Clyde International' campaign was formed -  by David O'Neill  - with the aim of stopping her being sunk and bringing her home to Scotland to be rebuilt and sailing again. After lengthy negotiations, we have managed to convince them to work with us to help bring her home and rebuild her so she can sail around the world again and we have ambitious plans for her (as detailed below).</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>We need your help!</u></h3>
<p>By donating whatever you can, we can raise enough money to bring her back to Scotland. We have been in lengthy talks and have come to an agreement with a lift ship company who are prepared to offer a contract to bring her back in March 2019 and we are attempting to raise half of the full balance and by helping us do this, you will ensure her future.</p>
<p>We need £550k ($720k) to book the lift ship that will bring her home (this is half of the entire lift ship bill) and anything raised above this target will go towards the final lift ship bill, repair and rebuild costs. If we don't reach our target, we will use the money to try and negotiate a new deal with the lift ship company and if this fails (and she is ultimately sunk) we will donate the money to homeless charities in Scotland and Hawaii. However, we are confident that everyone will dig deep to help us meet the target.</p>
<p>Any funds raised above the £1.35 million ($1.5 million) needed for the lift ship will contribute towards her restoration.</p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Impact</u></h2>
<p>As well as a ship that is steeped in history and heritage, she will have several other roles :</p>
<p><strong><u>Helping the poorest of our communities</u></strong></p>
<p>We want to help the most underprivileged kids from our communities and take them on the trip of a lifetime. For 9 months of the year, we will be teaching them onboard with our 'education at sea' program (via fully qualified teaching staff and crew) and help them grow, mature and give them hope for a brighter future as they experience new cultures and see the world. </p>
<p><strong><u>Fairtrade Cargo</u></strong></p>
<p>We plan to carry Fairtrade cargo such as rum, whiskey, chocolate and coffee (to name but a few) and help communities all over the world, ensuring farmers and workers are paid a living wage and that their children are able to go to school. We also want to teach the kids onboard about these communities, getting them involved with all the steps and processes and helping them strengthen relationships and make lifelong friends. We have further plans to set up a fair trade project from Scotland - becoming a carbon-free sail powered cargo service.</p>
<p><strong><u>Ocean waste and plastic collection, cleanup and recycling</u></strong></p>
<p>Plastic in our oceans is a huge problem and we plan to put the Falls to good use by fitting with the latest technology available and cleaning up the ocean as she sails. We will clean-up, recycle and collect the plastics from our oceans and have several promising plans in place to make this happen. </p>
<p><strong><u>Carbon Free/neutral technology</u></strong></p>
<p>We plan to fit her with the latest 'green' technology (including renewable energy such as solar, electric and - of course - wind power) to ensure that she remains carbon free/neutral. Becoming a role model for the rest of the world and trailblazing the latest green technology - the world will be following in our wake!  </p>
<p><u><strong>Sail training</strong></u></p>
<p>We want everyone to get a chance to sail on this beautiful ship and, during certain times of the year, we will have space on board for sailing adventures. Letting the public experience life on the big blue ocean and helping them reach their full potential, reaching heights they never thought possible.</p>
<p><strong><u>History and Heritage</u></strong></p>
<p>During her rebuild phase (and beyond) we have plans to build a museum and genealogy centre around the harbour where she is being rebuilt. Here people can learn about the history of ship building, the history of the 'Falls Of Clyde' and genealogy; helping us understand the world around us. <br/><br/>Once restored, we are also considering reinstatement of the once famous 'Tea Races' culminating on the Clyde. Challenging other tall ships globally and showing them why Clyde built remains the best built.</p>
<p><strong><u>Self sustaining ship</u></strong></p>
<p>All of the duties listed above will ensure that the ship will be self sustaining whilst making an impact and putting Scotland firmly on the map in terms of technology, social and community causes and ensuring that we give the future generations hope for the future.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h2>
</div><div>
<p>There is always risk with a project as large as this. Not raising enough money and the ship being deliberately sunk is the biggest risk at the moment as we are on a tight deadline and the Hawaiian authorities have given us a limited time to complete this task. She also needs to be repaired and getting her onto the lift ship will be a delicate operation.</p>
<p>In order to overcome these risks, we are continually updating the Hawaiian authorities and being as transparent as possible about any problems we face to ensure a strong working relationship continues and they continue to cooperate in getting her home. There have also been several naval architect reports done and all of them have come to the same conclusion that she can be repaired and would be able to sail again. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we are continually talking with the lift ship company and they are confident that this operation can be completed with minimal risk to the ship. We are also continually negotiating with councils back in Scotland, ensuring she has a place to come home to. This has, at times, proven difficult but by building trust and developing relationships, we are now very much underway and, presently, she is heading back to Troon to for the first stage of her repairs.</p>
<p>Finally, the bill to bring her home and restore her was originally much higher (to just bring her home was costing around £3.8 million - $5 million -) but we have managed to bring the price down to a more realistic target and are actively engaging with various companies and trades to bring the repair costs down further.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">
<u><strong>The n</strong></u><u><strong>ext phase</strong></u>
</h2>
<p>We are aware that we are only asking for half of the money needed to bring her back home but even though we plan to raise as much money as we can via crowdfunding platforms (through the incredible generosity of you guys!) we plan to raise further funding through a commercial sponsorship campaign during her journey home. </p>
<p>We are currently planning to launch the commercial sponsorship campaign for global companies to gain brand exposure during her journey home. We have been talking with media stations all around the world about covering this journey and we are confident she will be well covered through TV, social media and radio which, in turn, will mean people will see the company's logos emblazoned on our 'temporary' sails (see the plan below)- this will help us raise more of the money needed to help rebuild her and get her sailing again. The branding will also be present during the several stops we have planned on her journey home and the final bonanza (spanning the length of the Clyde) on her return to Scotland. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536669841/gag8pwl5ciavsy17ddxw.jpg"" src=""""/>Furthermore, we have been advised that part of the funding could come from various social and lottery funds but, without your help, none of this will happen as we need to get her back home (in UK waters) first in order to qualify for this type of funding. We are confident that if we can raise enough money to get her home, we can raise the rest of the money needed to restore her as we also have innovative ideas around engaging with suppliers and skill sets and these ideas have been positively received. This, in turn, will help reduce the overall cost of her rebuild.</p>

This is the idea that inspired the La Calaca Festival and this is why it is free and open to the entire community of San Miguel de Allende during the Day of the Dead celebrations. To preserve and promote this beautiful tradition, we need your help!This communal projected memorial will raise the funds necessary to cost the multiple high resolution projectors, and all the technology and logistics needed to pull off a piece of work of these dimentionsObviously we can't do it all for $5000, but the more we exceed our modest goal, the more exciting programming we can offer to the community.Why a public, collective video memorial is impactful.This projected communal projection mapping memorial will be seen by thousands of people who will be moved to remember their loved ones who have passed, and others whom they admired and respected.We wish to honor the victims of the earthquakes that have shaken the spirits of the Mexican people and the global community. We do not wish to burden the town with solicitations for funds when funding is so scarce in the wake of this tragedy. La Calaca is known for its resourcefulness, year after year (it was founded in 2012) despite the tiny budgets we have had to work with.Please share this campaign with your friends!The more people who contribute a video or still image honoring someone special, the more impactful the installation will become. And the more funding we will have to move the hearts of the community during this profound traditional holiday, which is beginning to be recognized as a relevant celebration the world over. So thank you for sharing this campaign far and wide (Indiegogo share tools make it easy). It feels good to honor people we care about, and we amplify how impactful these people were in your life in a beautiful, crowd-sourced way in one of the most magnificent towns in the world.

<h3><strong>A propos du film / About the Film</strong></h3>
<p><strong><i>French:</i></strong> La France Cachée est une série de documentaires qui met en avant les communautés peu représentées en France. La première partie présente la communauté noire de France à travers une riche palette d’acteurs de différentes origines, religions et milieux sociaux. </p>
<p><i><strong>English:</strong></i> La France Cachée (The Hidden France) is a docuseries that empower underrepresented communities in France. The first part presents the black community of France through a rich palette of actors from different origins, religions and social backgrounds.</p>

<h3>Qu'est ce qui a poussé le réalisateur à faire ce projet / What prompted the director to create this project:      </h3>
<p><strong><i>French: </i></strong>Je suis arrivé sur Paris en décembre 2015 après avoir passé sept ans et demi en Asie du Sud. J’ai été très content de voir la diversité en France comparée au manque de mixité en Asie. J'ai ensuite remarqué le manque de représentation des personnes racisées dans les médias (magazines, télévision, publicités, etc…) </p>
<p>Je ne comprenais pas ce décalage, surtout dans un grand pays cosmopolite comme la France. J’ai également eu le même sentiment lorsque j'ai visionné des émissions et des films français. Très peu de personnes racisées obtiennent des premiers rôles. </p>
<p><i><strong>English:</strong></i> I arrived in Paris in December 2015 after seven years and half in South Asia. I was immediately very happy to see the diversity in France compared to the lack of diversity in Asia. Just few months later I began to see the lack of representation of people of color in the media (magazines, television, advertising, etc ...) I did not understand this shift especially in a large cosmopolitan country like France. I also had the same feeling when I watched French programs and films, very few people of color were given leading roles.</p>

<h3>Pourquoi devriez-vous soutenir ce projet / Why people should support the project:</h3>
<p><strong><i>French: </i></strong>A son arrivée en France, sur Paris, les retrouvailles avec ses racines, sa culture et sa communauté ont joué pour beaucoup dans le processus de création de La France Cachée. Beaucoup de questions dont certaines encore aujourd’hui n’ont pas trouvés réponses, ont poussées Christin Bela à comprendre pourquoi.  </p>
<p>Pourquoi, la société française n’est pas représentative de ce qu’elle est réellement. </p>
<p>A travers la réalisation complète de ce projet, nous voulons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Déconstruire les préjugés qui existent entre certains groupes d’individus en France. </li>
<li>Unifier et permettre un échange inter-communautaire afin de construire un meilleur vivre ensemble pour nous et nos générations futures. </li>
<li>Que chacun se réapproprie de sa narration afin de mieux partager son vécu, son passé et pour célébrer ses origines. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>""La double culture est une richesse qui ne fait pas partie de l’idéologie sociétale française. Si elle était beaucoup plus représentée, le racisme, l’islamophobie, l’antisémitisme, la xénophobie et tous les autres sujets qui crispent la société française seraient moins présents"". </i></p>
<p><strong><i>V</i></strong><strong><i>ivre dans un monde utopique n’existe pas mais il est possible de créer une société qui accepte et célèbre la différence.</i></strong></p>
<p>Nous avons créé une série de documentaires, car ces sujets sont souvent abordés à l’écrit par des médias mais pas souvent en video. Or, selon les études, le téléspectateur moyen se souvient de 95% d'un message lorsqu'il est regardé, alors que seulement 10% de celui-ci est lu. Notre but est de casser les préjugés et d’inspirer les générations futures à s’ouvrir aux autres.</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><i><strong>English: </strong></i>Upon his arrival in France, in Paris, his reconnection with his roots, his culture and his community played a lot in the process of creating La France Cachée.    Many questions, some of which still have not been answered, prompted Christin Bela to understand why.  Why, French society is not representative of what it really is.   </p> <p>If we can fully get this project completed we want to:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Break the prejudices that exist between certain groups of individuals in France. </li>
<li>Unify and allow an intercommunity exchange to build a better life together and our future generations. </li>
<li>Allow each group to reappropriate their own narration and share their experiences, because only them can do it better.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Double culture is a wealth that is not part of the French society ideology. If it were much more represented, racism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and all the other subjects that tense French society would be less present. </i></p>
<p><i><strong>Living in a utopian world does not exist but it is possible to live in a society that celebrate our differences. </strong></i></p>
<p>We initiated these docuseries because these type of subjects are often written in newspaper or online medias but not often in video. According to studies, the average viewer remembers 95% of a message when viewed, while only 10% of it is read. Our goal is to break prejudices and to inspire future generations to be more open with one another.</p>

A propos du film / About the Film
French: La France Cachée est une série de documentaires qui met en avant les communautés peu représentées en France. La première partie présente la communauté noire de France à travers une riche palette d’acteurs de différentes origines, religions et milieux sociaux. 
English: La France Cachée (The Hidden France) is a docuseries that empower underrepresented communities in France. The first part presents the black community of France through a rich palette of actors from different origins, religions and social backgrounds.

Qu'est ce qui a poussé le réalisateur à faire ce projet / What prompted the director to create this project:      
French: Je suis arrivé sur Paris en décembre 2015 après avoir passé sept ans et demi en Asie du Sud. J’ai été très content de voir la diversité en France comparée au manque de mixité en Asie. J'ai ensuite remarqué le manque de représentation des personnes racisées dans les médias (magazines, télévision, publicités, etc…) 
Je ne comprenais pas ce décalage, surtout dans un grand pays cosmopolite comme la France. J’ai également eu le même sentiment lorsque j'ai visionné des émissions et des films français. Très peu de personnes racisées obtiennent des premiers rôles. 
English: I arrived in Paris in December 2015 after seven years and half in South Asia. I was immediately very happy to see the diversity in France compared to the lack of diversity in Asia. Just few months later I began to see the lack of representation of people of color in the media (magazines, television, advertising, etc ...) I did not understand this shift especially in a large cosmopolitan country like France. I also had the same feeling when I watched French programs and films, very few people of color were given leading roles.

Ce que nous avons accompli jusqu'à présent/ What we've achieved so far: 
French: La première partie est une vidéo qui présente plus de 85 talents en studio. Elle à été entièrement autofinancée par le réalisateur Christin Bela cela comprend: la production et la post production ( location du matériel, location studio de tournage) l’organisation de plus de cinq projections en France (projection privée, festivals, salle de cinéma) l’organisation des projections à l’étranger (Canada, Londres) .Visibilité dans les médias écrits, télévisés et radios
English: The first part is an introductory video that presents more than 85 participants in  studio. It was entirely self-financed by the director Christin Bela it includes: production and post production (equipment rental, film studio rental) the organization of more than five screenings in France (private screening, festivals, movie theater) the organization of several screenings abroad (Canada, London, Cambodia) Visibility in print, television and radio media

Ce que nous voulons faire / What we want to do now:
French: 

Continuer à présenter les talents présents dans la vidéo avec des portraits individuels . 
Rencontrer de nouveaux profils non présents dans la première partie. 
Organiser un événement inter-communautaire pour permettre un échange culturel entre les communautés.

English: 

Continue to present talents in the film with individual video portraits.  
Meet new profiles not present in the first part.
Organize an intercommunity event to allow cultural exchange between communities.



 
Pourquoi devriez-vous soutenir ce projet / Why people should support the project:
French: A son arrivée en France, sur Paris, les retrouvailles avec ses racines, sa culture et sa communauté ont joué pour beaucoup dans le processus de création de La France Cachée. Beaucoup de questions dont certaines encore aujourd’hui n’ont pas trouvés réponses, ont poussées Christin Bela à comprendre pourquoi.  
Pourquoi, la société française n’est pas représentative de ce qu’elle est réellement. 
A travers la réalisation complète de ce projet, nous voulons:

Déconstruire les préjugés qui existent entre certains groupes d’individus en France. 
Unifier et permettre un échange inter-communautaire afin de construire un meilleur vivre ensemble pour nous et nos générations futures. 
Que chacun se réapproprie de sa narration afin de mieux partager son vécu, son passé et pour célébrer ses origines. 

""La double culture est une richesse qui ne fait pas partie de l’idéologie sociétale française. Si elle était beaucoup plus représentée, le racisme, l’islamophobie, l’antisémitisme, la xénophobie et tous les autres sujets qui crispent la société française seraient moins présents"". 
Vivre dans un monde utopique n’existe pas mais il est possible de créer une société qui accepte et célèbre la différence.
Nous avons créé une série de documentaires, car ces sujets sont souvent abordés à l’écrit par des médias mais pas souvent en video. Or, selon les études, le téléspectateur moyen se souvient de 95% d'un message lorsqu'il est regardé, alors que seulement 10% de celui-ci est lu. Notre but est de casser les préjugés et d’inspirer les générations futures à s’ouvrir aux autres.
________________________________________________________________________________________
English: Upon his arrival in France, in Paris, his reconnection with his roots, his culture and his community played a lot in the process of creating La France Cachée.    Many questions, some of which still have not been answered, prompted Christin Bela to understand why.  Why, French society is not representative of what it really is.    If we can fully get this project completed we want to:  

Break the prejudices that exist between certain groups of individuals in France. 
Unify and allow an intercommunity exchange to build a better life together and our future generations. 
Allow each group to reappropriate their own narration and share their experiences, because only them can do it better.

Double culture is a wealth that is not part of the French society ideology. If it were much more represented, racism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and all the other subjects that tense French society would be less present. 
Living in a utopian world does not exist but it is possible to live in a society that celebrate our differences. 
We initiated these docuseries because these type of subjects are often written in newspaper or online medias but not often in video. According to studies, the average viewer remembers 95% of a message when viewed, while only 10% of it is read. Our goal is to break prejudices and to inspire future generations to be more open with one another.

Risks & Challenges
“If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way” Napoleon Hill
French: La réalisation de films est un art pas une science exacte. Les principaux défis seront la planification, la gestion du temps, l’argent. Essayez de programmer 40 personnes vivant dans différentes villes pendant 30 jours! Pas une tâche facile.
Tous ces jours nécessitent diverses configurations de caméra, des réarrangements de lumières, un enregistrement audio propre et le plus imprévisible ""la météo"" puisque nous filmerons entre l’automne et l’hiver.
Je travaille avec une petite équipe de professionnels talentueux pour m'aider à terminer le projet et je suis convaincu que tous les risques susceptibles d'être rencontrés seront atténués de manière appropriée et avec votre soutien. Nous savons que nous pourrons en faire une série de documentaires incroyables.
English: Filmmaking is an art not an exact science. The main challenges will be scheduling, time management, money. Try scheduling 40 people all living in different cities over 30 days! Not an easy task. 
All of those days require various camera setups, light rearrangements, clean audio recording and the most unpredictable"" the weather "" since we will be filming  between autumn and winter. 
I am working with a small team of talented professionals to help me finish the docuseries and I am confident that any risks that might be encountered will be mitigated appropriately and with your support, we know we can make this an incredible docuseries.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Craftsbury Academy gifted their industrial arts building to Sterling College in 2017. Considering the growing needs of Paradise Hall, our former woodworking facility, the timing was impeccable. To ensure that Horace’s legacy endures, Sterling College is working to renovate the newly acquired building and rename it for Horace Strong--a space for Sterling students, the Academy's students, and members of the greater community with open-shop hours. </p>
<p>The renovated space will be home to Sterling College's Environmental Humanities program where students will engage<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> in the creative process to communicate, express their artistry, and effect change while exploring ways in which humanity engages with nature. We're prioritizing a space where students can explore what it means to transform a piece of ash into a canoe paddle, wool from the farm into yarn, local clay into pottery, plant pulp into paper, and ideas into poetry and prose. Ultimately, it means fully engaging with the natural world as we interpret, create, and share impressions and ideas with the broader community.</span></p>
<p>Horace was a man who found passion, friendship, and humor in our community; he was known for so many things, his commitment to his craft being one of them. This fundraising campaign is a way for you, the people that were so fond of Horace, to see that his commitment lives on. </p>
<p>While all donations are much appreciated, those who can contribute $250 or more will receive a token of our appreciation. The larger the gift, the more perks you are eligible for. All donors at the $250 level or higher will receive a 9 - 11"" tree cookie wood burned with your favorite Horace Strong quote -- here's a sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show me the person who never made a mistake and I’ll show you someone who never made anything.</li>
<li>As long as it’s perfect, it’s good enough.</li>
<li>The nice thing about wood and wood projects - they all will burn.</li>
<li>Never bleed on the work.</li>
<li>If at first you don’t succeed - blame Horace.</li>
<li>If at first you do succeed - try not to show your astonishment.</li>
<li>If you can't learn to do it well, learn to enjoy doing it badly.</li>
<li>Cheer up, it could be worse - I cheered up once and it got worse.</li>
<li>It’s good enough for who it’s for.</li>
<li>You are never a failure - you can always be used for a bad example.</li>
<li>A fool is always astonished by his early efforts.</li>
<li>Making a mistake is not a disgrace if you can make a new one every time.</li>
<li>One day reality will descend upon you like the warm sweet kiss of a sharp left hook.</li>
<li>It’s hard work working hard, ‘ent it?</li>
<li>If it weren't for the last minute, I wouldn't get anything done.</li>
<li>It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.</li>
<li>True success is overcoming the fear of being unsuccessful.</li>
<li>You can learn something new everyday if you don't know too much to start with.</li>
<li>Work a little, look a lot.</li>
<li>If all else fails, read directions. If that fails, follow them!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. Peer to peer fundraising, like this campaign, rely on <u>lots</u> of sharing. There is no such thing as over-sharing a campaign. And while broad sharing is good, so is personally inviting your fellow Horace-fans to join you in supporting the effort.</p>
