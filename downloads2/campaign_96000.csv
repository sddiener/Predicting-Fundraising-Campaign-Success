<p><strong>Who are earhoox™ designed for?</strong></p>
<p>earhoox™ are designed for everyone, with athletes in mind. The team took to the drawing board to solve a common problem, and focused on how individuals move with their music and their earbuds. We found that running, and intense exercise are a great reason pop in a pair of earhoox™, but that life is a great reason to keep them in. Whether wearing them for comfort, security, or style, earhoox™ will be there for you.</p>
<p><strong>Where do I specify the color I want?</strong></p>
<p>Please leave a comment with your color choice. </p>
<p><strong>Where do I specify the clothing size I want?</strong></p>
<p>Please leave a comment with your size choice. </p>
<p><strong>What am I supporting?</strong></p>
<p>The earhoox™ team has two goals for this project to fund. First, we plan to fund the production molds required to produce thousands of earhoox™ for the earhoox™ fan base! Secondly, we plan to fund the design and production of retail packaging that suits our brand, and that we would be proud to display on shelves in stores around the world.</p>
<p><strong>How do earhoox™ work?</strong></p>
<p>earhoox™ have two main features: the tire and the shark fin tip. Made of durable silicone, the tire stretches around any circular earbud to create a snug fit that keeps earhoox™ in place at all times. The shark fin tip comes in two sizes, Large &amp; Small, which provides a flexible shape to apply outward pressure and traction to key points of the ear. Together, the tire and shark fin tip transform your ordinary earbuds and elevate your listening experience.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know which size I am?</strong></p>
<p>Every set of earhoox™ comes with a pair in both sizes: Large and Small. We haven't found an ear that doesn't fit one of these sizes! So when you receive your set, try on both, pick a preference and then share the other pair with a different sized friend!</p>
<p><strong>""I love it, so what now?""</strong></p>
<p>Jump over to the perks section on the right hand side. We have created a bunch of options for you, and we hope you find one that suits you as well as earhoox™ themselves will.

<p>We want our supporters to love earhoox™ forever…so we made sure to mitigate as many risks as possible leading up to our launch:</p>
<p>• earhoox™ have already been fully designed, prototyped and tested! We’ve seen how our ‘testers’ love them and we know you will too! <br/><br/>• Some of our testers have been consistently wearing their earhoox™ for the past 6 months with no signs of wear, so we know they can withstand a beating! <br/><br/>• We’ve developed a great relationship with our manufacturer during our exhaustive prototyping phase. They are ready to ship as soon as we hit our funding goal! <br/><br/>• Our manufacturer is prepared to fulfill our expected goal – but they are also prepared to fulfill a much larger order (while maintaining quality) if earhoox™ are a wild success!<br/> <br/>• If any setbacks were to occur during the fulfillment process, we would keep our supporters very informed via personal messages and our social networks (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram)</p>
<p>With that said, we do believe our final challenge to overcome is getting the word out. earhoox™ needs to reach a lot of people to be successful. We’ve asked all our friends and family to spread the word, but that’s not enough. With so many great projects out there, we’re asking everyone to please share earhoox™ with your friends!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">About Roofus</h3>
<p>I'm Sean Pepper a carpenter from Western Australia. As an apprentice roof carpenter, I noticed a problem with the layout process of building material, most importantly rafters. There were too many tools required to complete such a simple task, I wanted one layout tool that could do it all, but it didn't exist.  So I invented one. It began with many drawings and sketches as an apprentice and developed into a series of prototypes. Most of them once lived in my tool belt and were used on site until the next prototype took its place.  It took 7 years, 25+ working prototypes, and a lot of really hard work to reach the final production design you are buying/using today.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>A donation of even the smallest amount can go a very long way as it may not just be you that's donating. Any small donation would be hugely appreciated as every bit counts and will help get my invention on shelves all around the globe. If you just can't contribute right now, or you have but want to help out more, please share our campaign using the social media share buttons, and best of all, help out by 'liking' us on Facebook and tagging all your friends that might be interested in the Roofus.</p>

After receiving a lot of feedback from the original Modifi3D and getting a vast number of requests for a more powerful, temperature controlled version we started the process of building a Modifi3D PRO towards the end of 2017.Much of 2018 was spent testing and developing various iterations of design. We have built numerous prototypes in various formats before settling on its final form and function.We devoted a lot of time to producing high quality tips giving a good selection of functions. These have been treated with our improved coating and have been trialed with numerous print materials. If you know someone who owns a 3D printer please share our campaign by clicking on the share buttons at the top of this page.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Imagine what it would feel like to leap out of bed every day knowing exactly what you needed to do. Then getting to the end of the week with a feeling of happiness and satisfaction because you had achieved everything you had set out to. Imagine waving goodbye to overwhelm, lack of focus, confusion, procrastination. 

Visualize being guided along every day on your road to success by a simple and proven goal setting system that allows you to stay completely focused on what really matters. MY PA helps you break down your long-term mission into bite-size daily goals and tasks so everything is more manageable. There's a gratitude journal, weekly review and idea and inspiration vault for mind-mapping and doodling plus you have a daily health and fitness tracker.

People who set three goals every day are more likely to achieve them.
This is why at the beginning of each day there is a space to write your three most important goals for the day.

My PA is a stylish planner and goal setting system, designed to make you feel like you have your very own personal assistant.
My PA is more than just a planner, it's a road map for your success with everything you need to turn your vision into a reality. It's designed for creatives, freelancer & entrepreneurs who really want to make the most of their gifts and lives.
Think of it as having your very own 24/7 personal assistant helping you to stay on top of your game, stop you from feeling overwhelmed and help you make every single day count. There is a place for every goal, project, idea, thought or intention. 

 
A chic & stylish planner which you'll want to keep with you all the time
 

My PA guides you step by step from creating your vision to planning everything you need to do to achieve your goals and dreams.



 


 


 

 When your tasks are scheduled in pieces, you'll reach your bigger goals with ease instead of trying to do everything in one day (and reaching burnout). 
MY PA guides you step by step through creating your big goals and then listing the projects you need to do to achieve those goals. It then helps you to break these big goals up into smaller monthly, weekly and daily goals as you go along.  It makes everything more simple and straightforward and takes away all those feelings of being overwhelmed.


 When you make space for your ideas, you create a mindset that allows you to feel even more inspired creative.


A gratitude journal helps you notice the beauty and the good thing that already surround you and helps train your mindset to find more things to be thankful for.

""I practice being grateful ""Oprah Winfrey said. And a lot of people say 'Oh Oprah that's easy for you, cause you got everything""
""On the contrary"" Oprah argued ""I've got everything because I practice being grateful""

You'll be sure to be more productive with the daily health and wellness tracker where you can record your exercise, mediation, and water intake daily.  

Have you ever written on paper and noticed your pen gliding across the page beautifully? We specifically designed MY PA  to give you that feel, upgrading the paper from other planners we saw on the market to create something you LOVE using. The lay flat section sewn binding is designed so even when you open your planner in the middle it will still lie completely flat. 



At 10 X 7 inches or 240 X 140 mm, the size is perfect and is between A4 and A5. Can be easily carried in a handbag or briefcase. The pages are section-sewn which makes it possible for the book to lie flat even when opened in the middle.
The matt laminate cover is easy to keep clean and flexi-bound, purposefully chosen to give a workable and friendly feel. The thicker elastic is designed to hold the notebook shut and can be used as a bookmark so that you can easily turn to the right page every time you open the notebook. There are two ribbon markers as well to help you keep other sections to hand.

The Members Club is an exclusive online Facebook Group where members connect and network with other like-minded entrepreneurs so they can continue to feel empowered, inspired, and motivated. The group will provide a place to sound ideas, find and give support and find accountability partners as well.  


We also realize that life is not just about work – it’s about balance. My PA provides support for health and fitness goals with a daily exercise, health and wellness tracker.

Just load the clay, download the model and click start to enjoy it, the process of creation. It allows you to print your special cup, vase and bowl, in addition to artworks like mask, sculpture and building model. The print material, clay, makes it different from the traditional 3D printer. Clay can be reused, very environment-friendly. Besides, the standardized process of loading clay is as simple as changing a battery.“Allowing you to create anything from intricate vases and bowls to masks and models, it’s a great idea — and something any self-respecting maker is going to want to add to their home studio.” -Digital Trends“ClayXYZ promises to be a revolutionary tool for individual ceramicists and sculptures ”- Designboom“ Printing in clay is getting more popular, where items could make fantastic gifts, mugs, light shades and models. It’s certainly a niche of 3D printing that’s worth exploring further.”-All3DP                      We love to bring our incredibly magical design to life.                                 Design Ceramic Musical Instrument                                                                        See detail                                     Intricately textured ceramic artworkTurn your idea into reality. Design your personalized vase, bowl and lampshade.

Now you can use ClayXYZ to print out a unique cup, fire it in kiln. After that, the cup can be directly used to drink water. You can also 3D print your own lampshade and bowl, design your own warm home.Three Steps to Start  
Load the clay: Load clay into the tube, then connect the tube with extrusion device. 
Download the model: start slicing software, download the model you want to print, then set such parameters as thickness and fill ratio. 
 Hit print: click start to send print order to the 3D printer. 
                                                   Three Steps to EnjoyDon't worry about limited 3D design experience We share Library of Models. We are continuously developing and adding new models on our Website or Thingiverse. So far, we have successfully printed many models, like cups, kettles, bookends, mask and Great Wall. All those models have been tested, which can be perfectly realized by ClayXYZ.                                     You can download models from clayxyz.com Also, users can upload awesome models to our website, share them with others. You can repair the printed artworkYou are able to choose different clays to deliver different styles. Also, you can glaze the artwork if you want it more fascinating. Glaze it with different colors, then fire it via kiln.                                    You can repair the clay-printed artwork.Extremely stunning! Besides, you can repair the clay-printed artwork. Don’t worry about making it worse. Melt it in the water and reuse the material. Pretty environment-friendly!ClayXYZ helps you starting from 1 to ∞With ClayXYZ, you will be free from spending much time on the same things. As an architect or sculptor, you can let ClayXYZ help you to print a lot of rough models, and then you can adjust and even recreate artworks on the basis of that. This is very time-saving! Just focus on making your most desirable design.                                                    For Artists and DesignersThe traditional 3D printer uses ABS plastic material which can not be reused. ClayXYZ uses the ordinary clay. You can dissolve it in water and reuse the material. Pretty environment-friendly.                                                     Extremely funEasy to Get the Print MaterialsYou can buy it anywhere you can. Amazon LinkThe clay is affordable for everyone.Reusable Natural MaterialMelt it in the water and reuse the material.

Great for both classroom and studio use 
Doesn't require oven baking - air dries in 24 hours 
Super pliability helps build hand strength and fine motor skills 
Perfect for all ages
You do not need to worry about firing problems because of this kind of clay exists. It is easy to buy (Amazon Link), and the price is very affordable.Fire the ModelDecorating it Before Firing  You can add some decorating components when it is half-dry.How to do it
Use a moist sponge to softly smear the surface of the dry model, until it is moist; 
Smear the glaze on the surface of the model, until the model is covered with 4 to 5 layers of glaze. Then air-dry the model. 
Add beautiful patterns on the surface by using other glazes if you like it. 
Put it into a kiln to fire it. 20 hours later, done!
If you just want to verify your design, then you do not need firing. If you want to make porcelain, you can choose to fire it. It is easy to buy (Amazon Link), and the price is very affordable.                               ClayXYZ Extrusion Device for ClayIt can be compatible with many existing FDM 3D printers.

The Impact
Imagine... A place where students can go to have some pure, unadulterated fun with friends. But I don't want to stop there...my ultimate dream is to franchise this and take it to other campuses so that students everywhere have the option of clean, healthy fun with their friends.  Your support will help create those good times and give students an alcohol-free alternative to the bars. As a personal and professional commitment to my community, I will endeavour to uphold a reputation of outstanding philanthropic and volunteer-based service by establishing a company culture that encourages such involvement with the community.       Non-Profits to Benefit:           - Sigma Chi Foundation           - Second Harvest Foodbank           - Cardinal WINGS (Ball State Student Organization)           - Many more...

<h3><strong>The most featured notebook ever</strong></h3>
<p>In today’s world wherein technology &amp; modernization are replacing every aspect of our life; one thing which remains mostly untouched is our notebooks. If you do a quick analysis on the history of notebooks &amp; journals nothing much has changed as most of the features remain same.</p>
<p>We at MintMug thought this situation needs a check and initiated the process of developing the most beneficial and most featured notebook ever. After a yearlong period of research &amp; development, numerous opinion surveys and countless prototypes we came up with <strong>“The Mont Notebook”.</strong></p>

<h1>What is the point?</h1>
<p>We at Vibrant Advertising have come to a decision. We want to help make marketing easier. Today that means digital marketing, because the days of paper ads are long gone. If you are a small retailer, that might mean finding a way to target your customers with ads that apply to them and will encourage them to visit your store. For others, it might mean placing an emphasis on a certain product you need to sell more of. For yet others, it could mean targeting a nationwide or global market, without a multi-million dollar budget. We think that should be not only possible, but easy. </p>
<h1>Now is the time to make it happen</h1>
<p><b>Mobile advertising – put your ads in EVERYONE'S POCKET. </b></p>
<p><b>Digital signage – Malls. Fast food. Hotels. Airports. Even sell advertising space on your sign, anywhere you want.</b></p>
<p><b>Web ads – UMM, HOW DID YOU FIND THIS?</b></p>
<p>Any and every platform that you decide is best. We will be there, watching and helping you succeed. We are developing a solution that can help do all of these things, and more. Much more.</p>
<h1>Vibrant Advertising has an incredible concept</h1>
<p>Design your own advertising. We will help you design it, target it, and if you want, publish it and manage it. But it’s yours. You decide where it should go and to whom. If you want a video wall that is 20 feet wide in your casino, we can help you make that happen, and you won’t have to spend another dollar on another software product. If you want to get ads to cell phones of people in your town that want to buy glow in the dark fish, we can help you make that happen too. The point is, it’s YOURS. Own it. If you believe in it, it will work. That’s our philosophy with our products, and we live by it. This is the Designer in it's current state.</p>

<p></p>
<p>We are building the best software possible, and it will make it easy to design and deploy your advertising. We have the best marketing and design staff available if you need them, and they can make your advertising return great results. Is there more work for you to do? Probably. There’re a lot of questions that have to be answered. But we will help you answer them. What do you want to do? Are you a single outlet retailer selling souvenirs out of a 200sf store? Will having walk-by traffic stop and look through your windows help sales? Are you looking to get people to sign up for your fantasy hockey league? Are you a cruise ship owner that has to target ads on dozens of huge HD screens on your ship? Do you own 9 casinos and have a new act performing? That’s cool. No matter who you are, how large or small your target audience may be, we can make your life easier and your advertising budget drop.</p>
<h1>Don’t buy the hype</h1>
<p>There are a lot of companies that can claim a million impressions of your ad every day on the web. The catch? They may be in Yugoslavia at 3 a.m., and you still get billed. You know what marketing works best? The marketing that finds people that might be interested in what you’re selling and tells them why to buy from you instead of someone else. It’s that simple. If you need local, walk by exposure, think about digital signage. If you need internet attention, we are partnered with an exceptional team of internet search specialists, NTS Search Marketing. They can help you target markets, manage results, and much more. What about mobile ads? How many have you seen on your phone, in Facebook™, or Angry Birds™ or any other app? Yours could be there too, reaching millions of consumers every day. Use your imagination!</p>

<p>A solution that does it all. Yeah, we know, it sounds too good to be true… and we all know what comes of that. The truth is, it is possible to solve this dilemma with one product (and some elbow grease). Our AdEx Suite will help you do everything we’ve claimed. You can design 1 ad that looks great on a 60 inch TV in your store, and export that to a mobile ad that looks just as good and can be sent straight to Google’s™ AdWords - and hit every mobile phone you want. Yes, you still have to pay for the ads in the apps or on their sites. Nothing good is free. But if you want us to manage that, no problem. If you want to handle it yourself, that’s cool too.</p>

<h1>The (not so) small print</h1>
<p>We talk a lot about digital signage. We’re big believers, and it works in a LOT of places. But here’s the real deal. In order to show stuff (ads, shows, commercials) on a TV or monitor, it takes a box plugged into that TV or monitor. For us that means a small computer attached to the TV or monitor. Same applies to any digital signage solution. (Does your TV work without any input? Exactly.) We have 2 solutions, and which one you might want depends on what you want to accomplish. We have a low cost, Android™ based solution that is solid and will do the basics. It can play your movies, ads, static pictures, and can support one HD monitor or TV. Perfect for a single storefront, for example. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/114172/files/20131005070130-AndroidPlayer.png?1380981690"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The other solution is based on Windows™ and costs a bit more, but it can handle advanced graphics, data access, and multiple monitors. The other reality, if you want to handle a video wall (more than 2 monitors) is you’d better call us and get the specs. It takes a serious computer to handle that much video, although our AdEx Player software can handle it no problem. We want to make sure you know the reality of what you’re getting.</p>
<p><b>The rest of the real deal</b></p>
<p>Any and ALL rewards that do not include a player device WILL require one to utilize the digital signage player features. You will NOT need anything additional to use our software for it's great advertising export features.</p>
<h1>Other stuff</h1>
<p>Yes, we call this a digital advertising tool. But think about that for a second. Does advertising mean you have to be selling something? Or just telling people something? Because we do a bit more than the name might suggest. How about the flight status monitors you’ll find in any airport? Or the menu at a fast food restaurant? Those are perfect for us too. If you’re interested in data access and display, please check out the technical specs, and do so believing we have you covered.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 40px;"">The AdEx Suite</span><br/></p>
<p>AdEx is the brainchild of Russ Thiel, a gifted software developer hailing from Denver, Colorado. On one of his many projects, he found himself searching for a reliable, easy-to-use Digital Signage package, and pretty much came up empty. He located a couple that were very outdated and very, very overpriced, and a couple more that will host and display pictures and videos from the web but not much else. Neither extreme fit the bill.</p>
<p><b>Enter the AdEx Suite</b>. Supporting all 3 major platforms – Windows, Android, and iOS – all in one Designer. Just imagine, creating a single project and targeting any of the 3 platforms with 1 click! We will initially have limited functionality on Android and iOS, and full functionality on Windows. But the upside to that is we are building in an export tool (think <a href=""http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/55699807924/yahoo-acquires-admovate"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/55699807924/yahoo-acquires-admovate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MOBILE ADVERTISING</a>), so you can create static or animated content, and save it as images or movies, <i>targeted to each mobile platform</i>. Exactly like the big marketing firms do! We expect that the Digital Content firms are going to be really upset, because we’ve pretty much made them obsolete. Maybe we should give them a discount or something.</p>
<p><b>But back to the project</b>. There are 3 basic software components; the Designer, which is where all the cool, artsy stuff happens. It Supports animations(which vary depending on platform), all kinds of data - and we mean all kinds (Windows Players only!) - Sql Server, Oracle, Excel, MySql, and anything else that has an ODBC driver. Not sure what ODBC is? That’s cool, there is a wizard to walk you through getting any of your data to the Designer in a few simple steps. Of course we included the ‘standard’ transitions you see everywhere, like pixilate, blinds, fade and wipe; but we also added things like animating transparency, location, colors, and rotation! We know that’s a lot to take in, although it’s a tiny fraction of what the AdEx Suite can do. So please watch the video to see some examples of what we mean.</p>
<p><b>The second component</b> is not quite as sexy, but every bit as important. Called the AdEx Server, it gives you the tools to schedule, rotate, and manage playing your content on your digital signs. You can control everything from your web browser using our secure server.</p>

We at Vibrant Advertising have come to a decision. We want to help make marketing easier. Today that means digital marketing, because the days of paper ads are long gone. If you are a small retailer, that might mean finding a way to target your customers with ads that apply to them and will encourage them to visit your store. For others, it might mean placing an emphasis on a certain product you need to sell more of. For yet others, it could mean targeting a nationwide or global market, without a multi-million dollar budget. We think that should be not only possible, but easy. 
Now is the time to make it happen
Mobile advertising – put your ads in EVERYONE'S POCKET. 
Digital signage – Malls. Fast food. Hotels. Airports. Even sell advertising space on your sign, anywhere you want.
Web ads – UMM, HOW DID YOU FIND THIS?
Any and every platform that you decide is best. We will be there, watching and helping you succeed. We are developing a solution that can help do all of these things, and more. Much more.
Vibrant Advertising has an incredible concept
Design your own advertising. We will help you design it, target it, and if you want, publish it and manage it. But it’s yours. You decide where it should go and to whom. If you want a video wall that is 20 feet wide in your casino, we can help you make that happen, and you won’t have to spend another dollar on another software product. If you want to get ads to cell phones of people in your town that want to buy glow in the dark fish, we can help you make that happen too. The point is, it’s YOURS. Own it. If you believe in it, it will work. That’s our philosophy with our products, and we live by it. This is the Designer in it's current state.

Who we are
We've built a solid team with years of development, sales, and digital marketing experience, all pointing to this project being a success. Meet our team.

This is what we do

We are building the best software possible, and it will make it easy to design and deploy your advertising. We have the best marketing and design staff available if you need them, and they can make your advertising return great results. Is there more work for you to do? Probably. There’re a lot of questions that have to be answered. But we will help you answer them. What do you want to do? Are you a single outlet retailer selling souvenirs out of a 200sf store? Will having walk-by traffic stop and look through your windows help sales? Are you looking to get people to sign up for your fantasy hockey league? Are you a cruise ship owner that has to target ads on dozens of huge HD screens on your ship? Do you own 9 casinos and have a new act performing? That’s cool. No matter who you are, how large or small your target audience may be, we can make your life easier and your advertising budget drop.
Don’t buy the hype
There are a lot of companies that can claim a million impressions of your ad every day on the web. The catch? They may be in Yugoslavia at 3 a.m., and you still get billed. You know what marketing works best? The marketing that finds people that might be interested in what you’re selling and tells them why to buy from you instead of someone else. It’s that simple. If you need local, walk by exposure, think about digital signage. If you need internet attention, we are partnered with an exceptional team of internet search specialists, NTS Search Marketing. They can help you target markets, manage results, and much more. What about mobile ads? How many have you seen on your phone, in Facebook™, or Angry Birds™ or any other app? Yours could be there too, reaching millions of consumers every day. Use your imagination!
Our answer
A solution that does it all. Yeah, we know, it sounds too good to be true… and we all know what comes of that. The truth is, it is possible to solve this dilemma with one product (and some elbow grease). Our AdEx Suite will help you do everything we’ve claimed.

Our Idea
As with any innovative idea, SeatSync comes from the belief in a better way to do things. We are die-hard sports and music fans, and we know how challenging it can be to buy or sell tickets to an event. Exorbitant fees, inconvenient transactions, and poor customer service are the status quo for the industry. In addition, trying to buy or sell tickets at the last minute usually ends in disappointment or, even if you are lucky, the hassle of coordinating a complicated transaction.We are creating SeatSync to unite buyers and sellers in a transparent, convenient, and low-cost secondary marketplace. We are committed to creating the experience our users deserve.
This means:


No huge fees. Our competitors charge up to a 25% commission on every transaction. We think that is unfair. SeatSync charges a flat usage fee of $2 per transaction to anyone who sells tickets to an event. Buyers pay no fees. 



A safe ticket transaction that values your privacy first, while ensuring accountability by using a well-established peer-to-peer marketplace strategies.



A seamless, mobile marketplace using location-based technology, centered around buying or selling your tickets as efficiently as possible.

With SeatSync, listing your tickets is fast, easy, convenient and FREE. Then, when you sell your tickets, sellers pay only $2 per transaction. Buyers pay no fees, so the full ticket price is received by the ticket seller. Plus, no fee for buyers makes them more likely to buy your tickets. 
 How does SeatSync work?
SeatSync is a simple, easy to use native application for your mobile phone. The process couldn't be simpler. 

Ticket sellers list their tickets on SeatSync for upcoming events, and the place(s) and time(s) when a transaction works best.
Ticket buyers search the SeatSync listings based on each event, price, and seat location, and select tickets for purchase.
SeatSync facilitates the transaction, enabling the buyer and seller to meet at an agreed upon time and place, usually based on the seller’s ticket listing.
SeatSync then follows up with both parties to ensure that the transaction went well, the tickets were as expected, and that everyone is happy.

The Impact
SeatSync is currently slated for launch in the early summer months of 2012. We are looking to raise $7,500 to help fund application development and ensure that our initial launch this summer is a success.

<h3>The smarter way to write and cite</h3>
<p>Meet <strong>Evie</strong> and <strong>Emma</strong>, they’re both writing their final Masters assignment which involves group work.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511829944/bkwiopayzlwavuuzhbby.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Evie</strong> is writing in Microsoft Word and uploading to Google Drive for collaboration. When a group member makes changes, she downloads the new version, edits, and uploads; and so do the others. There’s a lot of emails checking on where everyone’s at. Others in the group prefer DropBox to collect research. All group members have used different kinds of formatting and referencing, and it’s taken her hours to reformat to the right style. They’ve spent more time on managing each other and formatting than they have on writing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511829991/ltjj0gjmt9bw31d6wlst.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Emma</strong> has ComWriter. She and her group members all access the same document and can see each others’ changes in real time. She uses the task management tool to keep everyone on track with deadlines. Because they're all on the same page, literally, they’re all using the same University style guide and formatting the references was instant. The team has also invited their supervisor to check the draft online.</p>

The smarter way to write and cite
Meet Evie and Emma, they’re both writing their final Masters assignment which involves group work.

Evie is writing in Microsoft Word and uploading to Google Drive for collaboration. When a group member makes changes, she downloads the new version, edits, and uploads; and so do the others. There’s a lot of emails checking on where everyone’s at. Others in the group prefer DropBox to collect research. All group members have used different kinds of formatting and referencing, and it’s taken her hours to reformat to the right style. They’ve spent more time on managing each other and formatting than they have on writing.

Emma has ComWriter. She and her group members all access the same document and can see each others’ changes in real time. She uses the task management tool to keep everyone on track with deadlines. Because they're all on the same page, literally, they’re all using the same University style guide and formatting the references was instant. The team has also invited their supervisor to check the draft online.

 
ACADEMIC SUCCESS STARTS HERE

Imagine being able to do all of this:

Collaborate and make changes in real time; you can see others writing as they write on your screen, just like Google Docs (but with all the academic tools you need). Say goodbye to messy file sharing or file syncing forever.


Format everything correctly in just one click; automatic formatting and reformatting using built-in style guides and templates; for references AND text.

Use it anywhere, and collaborate with anyone; it’s cloud-based so there’s no need to install software. Plus, it backs everything up for you so you never lose your work.

Access more than 30,000 journal and university style guides for all disciplines; apply a pre-defined style guide or customize your own to make all your text AND references perfect for your personal writing, your assignment, your thesis, conference paper or journal article.


Store all your research material (including your bibliography, images, tables and Url links) to reuse instantly in other projects.
​​

Write anything: blogs, preprints, conference papers, teaching material, assignments, or essays, for ANY subject or discipline.


Manage what needs to get done by adding comments, todos, and notes. Assign tasks to colleagues and set due dates for tasks. Chat with colleagues online.


Track milestones or monitor the progress of sections (e.g., chapters). Assign sections to collaborators, set wordcount and reference targets, or add due dates.

The reason for this is that the delta design has a few advantages over Cartesian printers. The most important one is that the moving parts are lightweight, making it print faster and with higher precision. Another important advantage is that the overall design is less complicated and uses less parts, which in turn makes the machine cheaper to produce and easier to maintain. The downside is that the printer, because of how the arms move, must be much taller than the actual print volume used, but for the Optimus though, we have turn this downside into a strength since the extra length is then available to you when you turn it into the Cartesian configuration, working with the laser or CNC.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484305283/zgtozziirfpks8t6fiws.png"" src=""""/></p><p>With the 50cm long sliders the printing volume is 24cm in diameter and 30cm in height.

We have installed a CNC machined aluminum heat sink in combination with cooling fans to effectively transport heat away from places we do not want it. Inside the heat sink is also a titanium isolator which conducts half as much heat as steel, and five times less than brass. This keeps the heat concentrated around the nozzle where we want it and greatly reduces blocks.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485940108/lmxvfh0j42zpglgoxxmm.png"" src=""""/></p><p>In case you would like to print with different nozzle sizes we made it very easy to swap.

<p>The control box is the brain of the Optimus and contains two powerful 32-bit processor boards, one for machine control and the other for the touch screen. On the back we put easy to use, plug and play connectors, connecting the control box to the different parts of the machine in a easy way. You can control the printer with the touch screen in similar ways to how you use your smartphone. You can transfer gcodes either by USB or SD. With our phone app (more info further down) you can connect over WIFI to e.g operate the machine, send gcodes or set it up for laser cutting and CNC milling.</p>
<h3><strong>Automatic bed leveling</strong></h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.febtop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/calibration.gif"" src=""""/><p>To make sure the machine prints with reliable quality every time you use it, we installed an automatic bed leveling system to make sure the bed is always leveled. The delta arm will probe the bed and figure out the perfect plane matching the bed. This makes sure that the first layer will be printed perfectly with optimal adhesion.</p>
</div>
</div><h3><strong>All metal body</strong></h3><p>The majority of the parts on the Optimus is made out of metal.

All without compromising the performance or quality of any of the tools.Press Reviews​The ideaWe wanted to make a machine that could help you make your own products, going from an idea, to a prototype and to a final product. We wanted the machine to be capable of modifying your personal items, like engraving your own name on a bag. But most of all we wanted a machine that could build things you can not find in stores, like this inductive chess game, which are fully made with the Optimus.In this chess game the pieces has been 3D printed, the black squares laser engraved and the tracks separating them, has been cut with the CNC. Even the PCB board powering the induction coils under it, has been made with the CNC.The Optimus is bornThe solution we came up with was a modular machine that can quickly be transformed by the user into the tool that you need, illustrated in this stop-motion video.The Optimus has two different configurations, a vertical delta formation and a horizontal Cartesian configuration. Each form is optimized for for a certain tool. The delta for 3D printing and the Cartesian for laser cutting and CNC.By making it easy to rebuild into two different configurations we could fit a 3D printer, laser cutter and CNC mill into the same machine. The transformation can be done in less than 10 min.To make sure that this absolutely works we have:

 Made it so that after transforming the machine it can calibrate itself so you do not have to spend time and effort every time tuning it in. No need for manual calibration.​

We tested three Optimus machines, assembling/disassembling each of them more than 500 times and it had no effect on the performance. If you transform once a week, 500 times means 10 years! Because of the metal body, transforming it a large number of times will not affect its accuracy.  But it is important to fasten the screws tight each time!
Made it extra strong and rigid for the CNC  with a unique mechanical design as shown below.
​​To give you an idea how strong and reliable the Optimus is, Simon did some crazy tests on it.  

 
The slider is the fundamental part of the machine. It is the movable part used in both configurations.Because of its simple design it is easy to manufacture and transport, bringing down the costs.PerksThe Optimus a very affordable and capable desktop fabrication machine that gives you a lot of bang for the buck. Here is a comparison table of tools on the market with similar performance.We have built and carefully tested 20 machines and we have already started production of 50 units that will be ready to ship to the first backers in March, after the campaign is over. Below you can see some pictures and a video from the production.
 

Premium delta 3D PrinterWe choose to design the 3D printer of the Optimus as a delta model. The reason for this is that the delta design has a few advantages over Cartesian printers. The most important one is that the moving parts are lightweight, making it print faster and with higher precision. Another important advantage is that the overall design is less complicated and uses less parts, which in turn makes the machine cheaper to produce and easier to maintain. The downside is that the printer, because of how the arms move, must be much taller than the actual print volume used, but for the Optimus though, we have turn this downside into a strength since the extra length is then available to you when you turn it into the Cartesian configuration, working with the laser or CNC.With the 50cm long sliders the printing volume is 24cm in diameter and 30cm in height. Large enough to satisfy most of your 3D printing needs.AssemblyThe assembly of the delta is simple and contains just a few easy steps and can be put together in less than 10 min. Below Simon does a live demonstration of this process. NozzleFor the Optimus we have made sure you will not have problems with a blocked hotend. We have installed a CNC machined aluminum heat sink in combination with cooling fans to effectively transport heat away from places we do not want it. Inside the heat sink is also a titanium isolator which conducts half as much heat as steel, and five times less than brass. This keeps the heat concentrated around the nozzle where we want it and greatly reduces blocks.In case you would like to print with different nozzle sizes we made it very easy to swap. You simply remove one screw on the side of the hotend and pull it out. Nozzel sizes ranges from 0.2mm, 0.4mm, 0.6mm to 0.8mm.​
 

The Control box

The control box is the brain of the Optimus and contains two powerful 32-bit processor boards, one for machine control and the other for the touch screen. On the back we put easy to use, plug and play connectors, connecting the control box to the different parts of the machine in a easy way. You can control the printer with the touch screen in similar ways to how you use your smartphone. You can transfer gcodes either by USB or SD. With our phone app (more info further down) you can connect over WIFI to e.g operate the machine, send gcodes or set it up for laser cutting and CNC milling.
Automatic bed leveling
To make sure the machine prints with reliable quality every time you use it, we installed an automatic bed leveling system to make sure the bed is always leveled. The delta arm will probe the bed and figure out the perfect plane matching the bed. This makes sure that the first layer will be printed perfectly with optimal adhesion.

All metal bodyThe majority of the parts on the Optimus is made out of metal. We put thick 12mm steel rods and 10mm timing belts as the main structural component which makes the machine very strong, minimizes vibrations and optimizes print quality. This also makes it very quiet and smooth when printing.  Optional heated bedThe Optimus can also be upgraded with a heated bed covered with a PEI sheet on top, which makes prints stick to the bed without using glue, hairspray or other tricks.ExtendableIt is easy to extend the height of the Optimus if you would like to have a larger print volume. Just replace the sliders with longer ones.Technical details

<p><strong>Our Story:</strong></p>
<p>We are a Nomadic Society and keeping track of
assets and accounts is hard.<span>  We are the Baby Boomer generation, we are
Entrepreneurs, we are Parents,  We have a
lot of things to keep track of these days. 
Most of us also have aging parents that are a little bit
disorganized.  Almost all of us use the
internet in some way, shape or form.  Find
It Later was born out of sheer necessity to keep it straight.  There is almost no one on the planet that
would not benefit from our services.</span></p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<p>So how about this?<span> 
We created password-protected CheckItNow Lists that you download and
fill out on your desktop.  Only YOU and
your key-keeper (the lucky person in your life who gets your password) can even
open these lists.  We can’t even access
your lists – we only store the password.</span></p>
<p>Then, you create the trail.<span>  And the trail is this….go thru our extensive
CheckItNow lists. For example, write
down WHERE the account is located (Bank of America), what it is (Individual
Savings), and the last four digits (2222). 
Then move on thru the Lists.  You
will be also adding your User Names for Social Media accounts and where you
have those accounts.  Do you really want
someone to endorse you for sales when you are no longer with us?  That’s kinda creepy.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why we are on IndieGoGo:</strong></p>
<p>We can run this company without the 25K but we want
to make it better for you.<span>  Right now,
you download the CheckItNow Lists, fill them in, share your password with that
lucky Key-Keeper we mentioned above. With our fundraising goal of 25K, we can
offer you a lot more and also advertise in targeted areas to spread the word.</span></p>
<p>Here we go.<span> 
You will have your password-protected list on your desktop.  But what if your Key-Keeper lives in Texas
and you live in California?  What if you
are in the military and stationed overseas? 
The point is, your CheckitNow Lists would be in the cloud in safe,
secure storage.  No, this is NOT hackable
information because no full account numbers and passwords for those accounts
are stored.  You are storing the TRAIL. So now, if you pass on, your Key-Keeper enters
the password on the link provided from anywhere in the world and they can begin
to the process.</span></p>
<p>If you say to us – but my parents, myself, my
husband – already wrote a will so do I really need this?<span>  Yes, because a will doesn’t tell you WHERE
things are, it just tells you what you get. 
A will also doesn’t list money that is hidden under the bed or your
Social Media accounts.  And just because
THEY wrote a will for the both of you, each and every person has their own
stuff.  ESPECIALLY these days.  And if you own your business?  That’s a whole bunch more.  You need the trail, for you, Your aging parents?  You may have to buy them one and fill it out
for them – that’s what I did – but they still need it.</span></p>
<p><strong>And here are the facts to back this up:</strong> </p>
<p>Across the United States, there is more than $58
BILLION in unclaimed money.<span>  In New York
and Florida ALONE there are more than 36 MILLION UNCLAIMED insurance and bank
accounts.  Where does it go?  To the state. Then you say, that won’t happen to me.  I have all of it written down already.  Really? 
Because I said the same thing and found $27K in an IRA that I forgot
about.  I found it creating this
business!</span></p>

</div></div>","Our Story:
We are a Nomadic Society and keeping track of
assets and accounts is hard.  We are the Baby Boomer generation, we are
Entrepreneurs, we are Parents,  We have a
lot of things to keep track of these days. 
Most of us also have aging parents that are a little bit
disorganized.  Almost all of us use the
internet in some way, shape or form.  Find
It Later was born out of sheer necessity to keep it straight.  There is almost no one on the planet that
would not benefit from our services.
How it works:
So how about this? 
We created password-protected CheckItNow Lists that you download and
fill out on your desktop.  Only YOU and
your key-keeper (the lucky person in your life who gets your password) can even
open these lists.  We can’t even access
your lists – we only store the password.
Then, you create the trail.  And the trail is this….go thru our extensive
CheckItNow lists. For example, write
down WHERE the account is located (Bank of America), what it is (Individual
Savings), and the last four digits (2222). 
Then move on thru the Lists.  You
will be also adding your User Names for Social Media accounts and where you
have those accounts.  Do you really want
someone to endorse you for sales when you are no longer with us?  That’s kinda creepy.
Why we are on IndieGoGo:
We can run this company without the 25K but we want
to make it better for you.  Right now,
you download the CheckItNow Lists, fill them in, share your password with that
lucky Key-Keeper we mentioned above. With our fundraising goal of 25K, we can
offer you a lot more and also advertise in targeted areas to spread the word.
Here we go. 
You will have your password-protected list on your desktop.  But what if your Key-Keeper lives in Texas
and you live in California?  What if you
are in the military and stationed overseas? 
The point is, your CheckitNow Lists would be in the cloud in safe,
secure storage.  No, this is NOT hackable
information because no full account numbers and passwords for those accounts
are stored.  You are storing the TRAIL. So now, if you pass on, your Key-Keeper enters
the password on the link provided from anywhere in the world and they can begin
to the process.
If you say to us – but my parents, myself, my
husband – already wrote a will so do I really need this?  Yes, because a will doesn’t tell you WHERE
things are, it just tells you what you get. 
A will also doesn’t list money that is hidden under the bed or your
Social Media accounts.  And just because
THEY wrote a will for the both of you, each and every person has their own
stuff.  ESPECIALLY these days.  And if you own your business?  That’s a whole bunch more.  You need the trail, for you, Your aging parents?  You may have to buy them one and fill it out
for them – that’s what I did – but they still need it.
And here are the facts to back this up: 
Across the United States, there is more than $58
BILLION in unclaimed money.  In New York
and Florida ALONE there are more than 36 MILLION UNCLAIMED insurance and bank
accounts.  Where does it go?  To the state. Then you say, that won’t happen to me.  I have all of it written down already.  Really? 
Because I said the same thing and found $27K in an IRA that I forgot
about.  I found it creating this
business!
We did our homework.  Check out our website:  www.FindItLater.com,
our Facebook page, www.Facebook.com/finditlater
and our Twitter account, www.Twitter.com/kd_find
Thank you so much for the support.  You will thank me later when everything is
all easy-breezy.  And when you FIND
something you didn’t know you had, share it with us!  We will add it to our arsenal of
testimonials.

Street Shield was founded on the concept that we’re all human, and that
as humans, we are subject to error. Something as simple as a one-time mistake
in our entire busy, overloaded lives shouldn’t cost $75 or more; adding that
parking rules are often confusing and poorly laid out – well, we’ve had enough.
We at Street Shield recognize that parking tickets are a big drain on funds and
energy, and that there needs to be a better way of following the rules. You’re
a lawful citizen – why should you have to contribute to the annual pot of $17
billion dollars collected from parking tickets? We hear you – Street Shield is
the solution.<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
Your money will go towards the development of a technology that will
alert you when you are in danger of being fined. Street sweepers? No problem.
Through your phone, Street Shield will tell you when and where they are. Contributors
will be given a slot in our beta program, making you a first Street Shield
user.
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
</div>
The average person receives anywhere from 1-3 parking tickets a year –
if the city is being lenient, that’s anywhere from $75-$225! Pooling all of our
parking tickets together leaves a total of $17 billion dollars collected
annually going into what – more ways to give parking tickets. Street Shield
thinks we can all agree that we’re collectively <i>done</i> paying for that, can’t we?<div>
<br/><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div></div>
There isn’t much standing in our way. All we need is your help to finish
priming technology that essentially already exists. The last obstacle standing
is the government officiates, and with your help in cutting their funds by
following the law, it won’t take much more to cut that barrier down. After all,
who could argue with a product that helps a country’s citizens uphold the rules
of the road.<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div></div>
So don’t just sit there – help us so we can help you. If you can’t
donate today, that’s okay! There’s always tomorrow. And even if not then, just
spreading the word helps. Tell your family. Tell your friends. The reign of
street sweepers is over – Street Shield is here to stay.</div>

annually going into what – more ways to give parking tickets. Street Shield
thinks we can all agree that we’re collectively done paying for that, can’t we?

Risks & Challenges

There isn’t much standing in our way. All we need is your help to finish
priming technology that essentially already exists. The last obstacle standing
is the government officiates, and with your help in cutting their funds by
following the law, it won’t take much more to cut that barrier down. After all,
who could argue with a product that helps a country’s citizens uphold the rules
of the road.
  Other Ways You Can Help

So don’t just sit there – help us so we can help you. If you can’t
donate today, that’s okay! There’s always tomorrow. And even if not then, just
spreading the word helps. Tell your family. Tell your friends. The reign of
street sweepers is over – Street Shield is here to stay.

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p></p></div>","We launched a successful campaign a year ago and FLEKS3D is now with over 500 users in all 50 states and 37 countries. We are now back to offer additional sizes, plates for the DELTA 3D printers FLASHFORGE (and similar sized 3D printers) and the FLEKS3D ""Simple"". Plus we are offering our most popular sizes again for 3D Printers like MAKERBOT, ULTIMAKER and COBBLEBOT.


see full article here









FLEKS3D is an ADD-ON compatible
with ANY desktop 3D printer (FFM). FLEKS3D makes 3D printing EASIER, with a HIGHER SUCCESS RATE and provides a SMOOTHER WORKFLOW. EASIER
 by releasing the print with a single ""FLEKS"" of the plate. The part 
simply pops off. No more damaged prints, no more scraping and no more 
cut fingers. 



HIGHER SUCCESS RATE with a proprietary texture that grabs the first layer and keeps it in place. No more blue tape, No more hairspray.







SMOOTHER WORKFLOW with interchangeable print plates. Once the print is done, just switch the plate to a new one. FLEKS3D on ULTIMAKER 1.0

8x8 FLEKS3D on an Ultimaker 1 using ABSFLEKS3D on FlashForge






FLEKS3D ""SIMPLE"" is the most attainable of our products. This is a
 great entry level model to try us out. It simply attaches to the 
print-bed with clips. These are offered as a single plate starting from 
$15. An added bonus is that the SIMPLE offers more printable area since 
there is no frame, great options for those edge-to-edge prints.FLEKS3D ""SIMPLE"" on FlashForge



Yes, yes, yes and yes. With over 500 users worldwide FLEKS3D has been tested with a wide range of filaments. Our community has tested FLEKS3D to the max. FLEKS3D just works. 















FLEKS3D works with heated plates up to 100°F (40°C). However, we 
have found that it works great without a heated plate and we recommend 
trying without it first. When using a heated plate FLEKS3D might 
bend a little. If so hold it down with clips and you are good to go.
We provide a ""self-leveling puck"" for the users that have that feature. 
In the end of the campaign we will reach out to everyone to see who 
needs one.




Our first prototypes still work 18 months later. So we can’t say how 
long the lifespan is, just that it is longer than 18 months.

<h3>The Engine</h3>
<p>An amazing engine was invented over 30 years ago by a man named Joseph Papp. The engine had no cooling system, no intake, and no exhaust. It was fueled by an inexpensive mixture of inert gasses sealed into its cylinders. The engine was elegantly simple in construction and adaptable to mass production. It can be readily sized for individual home generation use in the Kilowatts up to village use in the megawatts. Its high torque power output was certified as correct to the USPTO. Unfortunately the eccentric and controversial inventor died taking the secrets to the fuel with him.</p>

We lost Tom to pancreatic cancer two years ago and have been struggling to find a perfect replacement since.</p>

<p title=""www.Pappengine.com"">Our efforts to restore this technology to operational status have taken giant steps forward.

<h3>
<br/>The Funding</h3>

<h3>
<br/>Enviromental Notes</h3>
<p>The environmental benefits of having no emissions what-so-ever should be quite obvious to all.

<h3>
<br/>Company Goals</h3>
<p>RGEnergy is driven only to take the engines to this final prototype stage before turning them over to the engine manufacturers with their vastly superior technology skills, and manufacturing abilities. We are in no way interested in reinventing the wheel. It is our belief that a superior product will be created by the existing manufacturers as they jump-in and retool voluntarily once the availability and standardized fuels cells is complete.</p>
<p>Initially, we believe that these engines will likely be relegated to functions such as regional power generation and pumping, until the development and reliability reaches a sufficient level to allow wider applications. Here we are getting ahead of ourselves and only speculating. But with each engine replaced the world will get healthier.</p>

It is our belief that a superior product will be created by the existing manufacturers as they jump-in and retool voluntarily once the availability and standardized fuels cells is complete.
Initially, we believe that these engines will likely be relegated to functions such as regional power generation and pumping, until the development and reliability reaches a sufficient level to allow wider applications. Here we are getting ahead of ourselves and only speculating. But with each engine replaced the world will get healthier.
 
Thank You
The support , the technical details, and the history is a far richer story than can be presented here. Please be sure to visit our website at www.rgenergy.com to learn more.
Your contribution could be the final piece of the puzzle. If you can’t contribute I would appreciate it if you would spread the word to others who can.
Together, let’s give old mother Earth a clean bill of health.

 Media report""It’s a little clamshell computer with HDMI, USB, and Ethernet ports… and a Serial port and a rugged design. The idea is that it’s a computer that could be used by network engineers, sys admins, and other folks who need those features. But with an expected price tag of $299, I suspect it might also appeal to other mobile PC enthusiasts when it goes up for order in a few months."" more >> The anti-shock aviation-level ABS synthetic resin LG-DOW 121H is imported from South Korea, with a thick thickness of 1mm, which is flame retardant, high-heat resistant, and V-0 fireproof, with a Rockwell hardness up to 109 R, and bending strength up to 26000kg/cm2. Its integrity rate reaches 97.63% under the 1.5m drop test.Its streamlined appearance is matt UV-sprayed, with rounded corners for great affinity and comfortable feel.The area of the strip-shaped hollow air inlet on the back is up to 28%, and the 3mm-high feet makes the bottom air inlet design sleeker.On the back, the 45°-inclined air outlet protects the external interfaces from dust accumulation and dissipates heat more smoothly.The non-slip twill groove gives a strong grip.Its 6” high definition (HD) wide color gamut (WCG) screen, with Corning® Gorilla® Glass 4 has a vividly colorful, natural, smooth and visible effect.With the 178° view, users can obtain an excellent visual experience at any angle.With 1280×720 resolution and 3000: 1 static contrast, it displays dedicate and bright colors.The rotatable axis supports stepless adjustment for the maximum stretch of 150°.A qwerty keyboard, touchpad, and 3D mouse are integrated into the C face, which is only 15×9cm in size. The metallic film button is wedge-shaped designed, which is more ergonomic and provides an excellent experience for finger pressing. The qwerty keyboard is backlit to meet the emergency needs at night, or in no light or dim light.The keyboard layout is more reasonable. You may complete all operations with your left thumb in case of only number inputs.MicroPC has a built-in touchpad with a larger operable area, while also supporting the left and right buttons of the touchpad. In this way, the cursor is slide more accurately through right thumb.The upper left corner of the C face is the left, middle, and right mouse buttons, with an appropriate width to assure an unfettered operation.The power key is recessed to avoid accidental touch. It is extremely convenient to turn on or off the machine by holding it in the left hand.The fan switch is centered, and the Off and On states are clearly identifiable.Two copper nuts (suitable for 2.5mm-diameter screws) are embedded on the back for fixing the machine in various complex environments. You can attach it to any rotatable hanger, stand, lift, tray, bracket, etc.MicroPC is provided with a user-friendly front lanyard hole, fit for any badge or mobile lanyard.The RS-232 serial port is widely used in industrial instrumentation, mouse, keyboard, printer, etc. Or go to RS-485 from RS-232 to achieve the data communication at 1200m and 100Kbps. MicroPC has built-in Gigabit NIC, and it supports wired network access through RJ45 interface for the maximum download speed of 125MB/s. MicroPC supports wireless 2.4G/5G dual bands, with the dual-channel max. transfer rate of 433Mbps.Similarly, in response to Internet of things applications, MicroPC also has a built-in Bluetooth 4.2 module that supports IPv6 connectivity options to make data transfer faster.The microSDXC slot carries the microSDXC card that is UHS-I bus, Class 10 standard, U2 grade and A1 specification, supporting the minimum random read and write I/O performance up to 1500 IOPS / 500 IOPS, the maximum data transfer at 104MB/s, and the expandable storage space up to 2TB.GPD MicroPC use Intel 8th Gemini Laks N4100 Embedded processer, reduced package size.TDP of CPU raise to 10W,  compare with 4415y(Microsoft Surface Go), a few advantage in single-core test but a number of advantage in multi core test.Compared to the 4415Y in the seventh-generation Kaby Lake architecture, N4100 in the eighth-generation Goldmont+ architecture boosts the CPU cache to 4MB, while 4415Y is only 2MB, which means the data execution time of N4100 is much lower than 4415Y.Description:CPU Mark Rating: As of 18th of December 2018 - Higher results represent better performance.CPU Single Thread Rating: As of 18th of December 2018 - Higher results represent better performance.CPU Value (CPU Mark / $Price): As of 18th of December 2018 - Higher results represent better value.The N4100 processor has a reference frequency of 1.10 GHz and a pulse frequency of 2.4 GHz, while 4415Y only supports a reference frequency of 1.6 GHz and no turbo frequency acceleration. In terms of overall performance, N4100 is better than 4415Y.MicroPC uses 9.5-generation Intel® UHD Graphics 600, supports operating frequency up to 700MHz, and increases the bandwidth by 33% over the previous generation. It supports 10-bit 4K VP9 film decoding, while the thermally-designed power consumption is only 10W, which can be called as a low-power decoder, and ideal for home theater personal computer (HTPC) and game console. The output of 4K×2K/60p HD video is available via HDMI 2.0 interface. Compared to Microsoft Surface Go's built-in LPDDR3, MicroPC is paired with high-frequency LPDDR4. Although it is a single-channel design, the indicators of read, write, and copy are not weak.MicroPC's built-in M.2 interface, together with the standard 128GB SSD for M.2 2242 interface, can expand the large-capacity SSD infinitely. The hard disk is tested with CrystalDiskMark for continuous reading and writing, and the result shows 576MB/s read rate and 465MB/s written rate. Its write rate is obviously higher than the Microsoft Surface Go 64GB and 128GB versions. Additionally, the read / write speed of MicroPC is more balanced while the write speed of Microsoft Surface Go is evidently lower.It applies the PC-level cooling solution with the active cooling design and high-power turbofan. MicroPC demonstrates better overall performance than the passively cooled Microsoft Surface Go.Three USB 3.0 interfaces and one Micro SD slot support up to 4 external storage devices and infinite storage. It is possible to extend more peripherals through the Hub.MicroPC supports PD 2.0-based fast charging, which can fill half the battery in 30 minutes. It also supports all 5V/3A-based mobile phone chargers and portable power source. Therefore, a charger can be shared between the MicroPC and the mobile phone. You can easily find the charging source at the airport or coffee shop (5V/3A charging output standard is available in most places).The much-maligned Windows 10 Home is abandoned, and instead, MicroPC will have Windows 10 Pro to give users a new experience!Furthermore, under the strategic cooperation with Ubuntu MATE, MicroPC will support Ubuntu MATE 18.10.At that time, you may download the Ubuntu MATE 18.10 firmware on the GPD official website and crowdfunding update area. The shipped machine defaults to Windows 10 Pro.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(000, 000, 000); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We’ve all heard about the Cloud. This brand technology allowing companies to put their data somewhere
else to reduce their expenses. The fact is that current offers do not really
cover what the Cloud is capable of.</span><br/></p>
<p>Plus, all current
offers aren’t privileging what really company needs: something <span style=""color: #2e74b5;""><b>easy to use</b><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span>, something <span style=""color: #2e74b5;""><b>trust worthy</b></span>,
and something which really make the Cloud <span style=""color: #2e74b5;""><b>beneficial</b></span>.</p>
<p>The Cloud is a remarkable tool, thou not yet used to it's full potential. Vistory was founded to bring it to the next level.</p>
<p>So, we created VESS, the
Virtualized Emulated and Secured Solution, the first <span style=""color: #2e74b5;""><b>Meta Cloud Management Platform</b></span>, the only global
Cloud Computing solution.</p>
<p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/933219/files/20141015115850-whats_vess.jpg?1413399530"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Cloud allows users to easily share, acces, monitor a software, information or data through a network.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/933221/files/20141015115946-VESS_ENG.png?1413399586"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>VESS is just the kind
of example illustrating this definition. But, contrary to existing offers, VESS
proposes more:</p>
<p><i><span style=""color: #538135;""><b><br/></b></span></i></p><p><i><span style=""color: #538135;""><b>The advantage?</b><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span></i></p>
<p>If indeed our solution
offers Intel systems host as the market is today, we added what the market isn’t offering: the hosting of Legacy systems such as Sparc,
AS400, MVS…</p>
<p>We know that today
companies are investing a lot of ressources (money, staff, time) just to keep those machines running.<b> </b><span style=""color: #2e74b5;""><b>The
investment can represent thousands even millions</b></span>.</p>
<p>VESS helps those companies
to reduce their budget, <span style=""color: #2e74b5;""><b>saving
30% to 70% on their IT budget</b><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span>.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><i><span style=""color: #538135;""><b>Keep it secured</b><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span></i></p>
<p>We
created VESS since the first day by <span style=""color: #2e74b5;""><b>optimizing it for all security matters</b><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span>.</p>
<p></p>

may have different needs in terms of confidentiality and security, VESS can be
deployed both in a Public Cloud (infrastructures are shared) or in Private

</ul><p></p>
<p><i><span style=""color: #538135;""><b><br/></b></span></i></p><p><i><span style=""color: #538135;""><b>A dedicated app</b><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span></i></p>
<p>Because efficiency and
speed are as important as cost is, Vistory developed VESS to assist <span style=""color: #2e74b5;""><b>customer needs whenever and
wherever they are</b><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span>.</p>
<p>We now live in a PC+
era. We need to access data everywhere, which is more important in a company
who needs <span style=""color: #2e74b5;""><b>flexibility</b><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span>. </p>
<p>And because those
profiles can be varied, VESS is now available on iOS and Android, and will be
soon released on Windows phones.</p>

<p>As explained, VESS is
allowing companies to not only transfer their data for Intel machines, but it
is also for older machines. <span style=""color: #2e74b5;""><b>This kind of offer does not exist today on the market</b><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span>. </p>
<p>More, today companies
have to deal with 3 or 4 different majors to access their data, or to simply
virtualize their servers. Coming soon, VESS will not only assure
virtualization, but also allow companies to access their data hosted by those 3
or 4 majors through <span style=""color: #2e74b5;""><b>only
one interface: VESS itself</b><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span>.</p>
<p>No more dealing with 4
invoices; 4 contracts; 4 suppliers. VESS is the only 1.</p>

<p>Coming from various
horizons, various experiences with several majors like Microsoft, Total or
FedEx, Vistory is firstly about dedicated people sharing the same business vision. And
as friends, we wanted to create something together.</p>
<p>Within our jobs, we
have met engineers, sales and even final customers, and, thanks to their
feedbacks, we thought our solution for each of them.</p>
<p>So, we know the market
is always right. If this is true today, what would it be in the next 3 or 5
years? Will all current applications be on the Cloud? </p>
<p>We strongly believe it
will be the case. And we don’t want to let the old Legacy servers remain a
blocker to the Cloud adoption for all customers. We used our experience to
answer to one simple question: what is the market is waiting for today?</p>
<p><span style=""color: #2e74b5;""><b>And VESS was born</b><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span>.</p>

<br/><p>We already have invested
20k on our own, and we’re expecting to raise 75k with this crowdfunding
campaign. Thanks to you donations, you will allow Vistory to <span style=""color: #2e74b5;""><b>extend its offering</b><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span> and provide VESS with

<p><span style=""color: #538135;""><b>Functionalities</b><span style=""color: #000000;""></span></span></p>
<p>Donation will allow us
to extend VESS to more machines not yet handled by the market. Those are for
the most legacy devices (old used servers, still running but not supported
anymore). VESS is now proposing Sparc, but we still need money to improve our
R&amp;D to add more old machines.</p>

<p>Here at Vistory, we
are aware of risks and challenge for a start up to present a new product on any
market, especially when you try to bring something new. Working for some of us
as IT project managers, we have solved many commercial/engineering/production
issues. </p>
<p>Plus, with our
experience at Majors as Microsoft and others, we perfectly handle all processes
from the plan paper to the final customer. </p>
<p>We’ve launched this
solution because we know that many companies are handling old servers, called
Legacy systems. Those are generally maintained for business constraints:</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>30 % of an
ITD budget is dedicated to the preservation of these servers</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Most of
them are 10 years old, thus at the end of editor / manufacturer support
lifecycle</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>They
involve security and maintainability risks</p>

<p>Thank you
for having taken time to read our offering and product. I am completely aware
that it is essential for you that your money is used of the best possible way.
Because we committed ourselves in the transparency of VESS, be sure we
committed also in the use of this fund raising.</p>
<p>Indiegogo is a wonderful platform, allowing startups and small companies to exist, to
market products, to create jobs. And hopefully, thanks to you, Vistory will be
one of those.</p>
<p>But none of
this can be possible without your donations. You are in the middle of the real
economy, the foundation of the future, Vistory’s future.</p>
<p>Make it
possible! Make it real! We count on you!</p>

else to reduce their expenses. The fact is that current offers do not really
cover what the Cloud is capable of.
Plus, all current
offers aren’t privileging what really company needs: something easy to use, something trust worthy,
and something which really make the Cloud beneficial.
The Cloud is a remarkable tool, thou not yet used to it's full potential. Vistory was founded to bring it to the next level.
So, we created VESS, the
Virtualized Emulated and Secured Solution, the first Meta Cloud Management Platform, the only global
Cloud Computing solution.



The Cloud allows users to easily share, acces, monitor a software, information or data through a network.


VESS is just the kind
of example illustrating this definition. But, contrary to existing offers, VESS
proposes more:
The advantage?
If indeed our solution
offers Intel systems host as the market is today, we added what the market isn’t offering: the hosting of Legacy systems such as Sparc,
AS400, MVS…
We know that today
companies are investing a lot of ressources (money, staff, time) just to keep those machines running. The
investment can represent thousands even millions.
VESS helps those companies
to reduce their budget, saving
30% to 70% on their IT budget.
Keep it secured
We
created VESS since the first day by optimizing it for all security matters.



Regarding the user access: Role-based user
access (RBAC), secured authentication


Network connection: Customer ring-fenced data,
firewalls, secured VPN network

Hybrid cloud solution : Because the companies
may have different needs in terms of confidentiality and security, VESS can be
deployed both in a Public Cloud (infrastructures are shared) or in Private
Cloud (infrastructures are dedicated), or a mix of the two models

A dedicated app
Because efficiency and
speed are as important as cost is, Vistory developed VESS to assist customer needs whenever and
wherever they are.
We now live in a PC+
era. We need to access data everywhere, which is more important in a company
who needs flexibility. 
And because those
profiles can be varied, VESS is now available on iOS and Android, and will be
soon released on Windows phones.
Cloud 2.0
As explained, VESS is
allowing companies to not only transfer their data for Intel machines, but it
is also for older machines. This kind of offer does not exist today on the market. 
More, today companies
have to deal with 3 or 4 different majors to access their data, or to simply
virtualize their servers. Coming soon, VESS will not only assure
virtualization, but also allow companies to access their data hosted by those 3
or 4 majors through only
one interface: VESS itself.
No more dealing with 4
invoices; 4 contracts; 4 suppliers. VESS is the only 1.
As Sauron would say:
‘1 solution to rule them all’ (lol)







Virtualized all machines with no exception


Administrate your users: create your account,
setup your own environments, manage your systems over VESS


Hosting location transparency: choose your
datacenter location in APAC, EMEA or USA. 


Pay-per-use: Only pay for what you use


Hybrid Solution: public and private Cloud
available


Scalable solution: whatever you are a small or
a major company, VESS adapts itself to your needs


Accessible through all type of devices: PC,
tablets, smartphones


On time invoicing: no surprises, you know in
real time what costs to expect







Coming from various
horizons, various experiences with several majors like Microsoft, Total or
FedEx, Vistory is firstly about dedicated people sharing the same business vision. And
as friends, we wanted to create something together.
Within our jobs, we
have met engineers, sales and even final customers, and, thanks to their
feedbacks, we thought our solution for each of them.
So, we know the market
is always right. If this is true today, what would it be in the next 3 or 5
years? Will all current applications be on the Cloud? 
We strongly believe it
will be the case. And we don’t want to let the old Legacy servers remain a
blocker to the Cloud adoption for all customers. We used our experience to
answer to one simple question: what is the market is waiting for today?
And VESS was born.



We already have invested
20k on our own, and we’re expecting to raise 75k with this crowdfunding
campaign. Thanks to you donations, you will allow Vistory to extend its offering and provide VESS with
more:
Functionalities
Donation will allow us
to extend VESS to more machines not yet handled by the market. Those are for
the most legacy devices (old used servers, still running but not supported
anymore). VESS is now proposing Sparc, but we still need money to improve our
R&D to add more old machines.
Design
After an intense research, companies are expecting VESS. But beyond functionalities, we need to
develop our own graphic identity, to propose something modern, sexy, and simple
for the final user.


Go
to market
A marketing campaign will be launched on 2015 to stimulate our international growth & commercial offer. Your donations will be used to expand our product visibility on the market.
Current
Roadmap







 
Well, if you’re
interested in participating to our growth, you may donate:







Here at Vistory, we
are aware of risks and challenge for a start up to present a new product on any
market, especially when you try to bring something new. Working for some of us
as IT project managers, we have solved many commercial/engineering/production
issues. 
Plus, with our
experience at Majors as Microsoft and others, we perfectly handle all processes
from the plan paper to the final customer. 
We’ve launched this
solution because we know that many companies are handling old servers, called
Legacy systems. Those are generally maintained for business constraints:
• 
30 % of an
ITD budget is dedicated to the preservation of these servers
• 
Most of
them are 10 years old, thus at the end of editor / manufacturer support
lifecycle
• 
They
involve security and maintainability risks

And as explained on
the video, the primary need is coming from the market itself, not from us. We
just seized this amazing opportunity.





Thank you
for having taken time to read our offering and product. I am completely aware
that it is essential for you that your money is used of the best possible way.
Because we committed ourselves in the transparency of VESS, be sure we
committed also in the use of this fund raising.
Indiegogo is a wonderful platform, allowing startups and small companies to exist, to
market products, to create jobs. And hopefully, thanks to you, Vistory will be
one of those.
But none of
this can be possible without your donations. You are in the middle of the real
economy, the foundation of the future, Vistory’s future.
Make it
possible! Make it real! We count on you!
Alexandre Pédemonte, CEO

FAQ

My friends already use PGP. Can I email with them?  Yes you can. Our automatic key lookup will find their key if it is available from a number of well-known key servers. Otherwise you can import their keys yourself.


I need more technical detail on the Whiteout solution.  Please check out our website for more information.


My friends do not have PGP and do not have Whiteout Mailbox. Do they need to get Whiteout Mailbox as well?  They can choose to get Whiteout Mailbox as well for a fully protected mailbox or they can PGP-enable their existing Mailbox by using the free Whiteout client.


What if I don't want a T-shirt?  Let us know and we'll donate the cost of the shirt to one of the well-known PGP non-profits.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

The quickest way to see MASSIVE improvement in your life is to question every next decision. Is this choice benefiting me or slowing me down? From bad habits to the words you use, and most importantly how you view yourself. Ask yourself, what do I need to do to have the life I want?  All of us have an instinct for success, but many people live their whole lives not utilizing this instinct. Most people go through life just wishing something great or exciting will happen but are left disappointed and frustrated because they're still stuck in a job they don't like and are still struggling in life. The only way to change the circumstances in your life is to change the way you THINK and the way you live. You deserve more than you tell yourself you do. You deserve to be HAPPY and FREE to pursue your dreams and your life's purpose. You deserve to live a life on your own terms, one that is designed by YOU and you alone. You deserve to succeed and become the best person you can be!  This is why we created this planner. Our MISSION is to help you navigate your days as efficiently as possible and maximize productivity in a fun, interactive way. We designed it as a game, so you can always challenge yourself to follow through your goals.Get into the habit of writing down your dreams and goals and review them frequently and revise them when necessary.Once you've steered your life to the direction you need to go and have developed yourself in the process, then we are successful in our mission. Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something. Don't let anyone dictate how your life should be lived. You are the Master of your fate and the owner of your mind and soul.     Productivity Game designed to challenge you in a fun way and lets you set rewards for a job well done.

<p> </p></figure></div><p> </p></div>","ARMPAL is a cross-age 3D wooden assembly tabletop game suitable for entertainment between 1-4 people, which could be perfect for either party games or family entertainment.  
 

 
 We designed quick-removable and replaceable head kits to expand the playability of Armpal.Based on the same set of control system and robot arm, we have designed three sets of components: manipulator caliper, excavator bucket, and magnetic crane.
Get ready to be surprised by our new upcoming replaceable head kits!
In only a few seconds, you can quickly transform your device.  
 ARMPAL can be used for multiple entertainment modes such as single-player entertainment, two-player battles, and multiplayer cooperation.We recommend the following 8 ways of playing according to the different requirements for operational proficiency, the actual duration of the game (short time≤3 min, long time＞3 min), and the number of participants in the game. 
   
 Manipulator Caliper Kit - Stack TowerThe players can use the mechanical robot arm-calipers kit to stack up the wooden cube blocks in turn in the central areas on Armpal exclusive table mat.If one side fails to stack or the wooden block tower falls down, the other side wins the game.Excavator Bucket - Seesaw Time⏳The time limit of this mode is 3 minutes.The players can use the excavator bucket kit to move the goods in your stacking area to the balance scale. When time is up, the very side with heavier goods to the balance scale (the side of the balance is lower) wins.Magnetic Crane - Transferring Race⚖️The players can use the magnetic crane kit to scramble for the goods in the central area and move them to your own stacking area.The game is over when all the goods are moved out. The very side who moves heavier goods wins. 
 

 
Build a 3×4 wooden block wall in the Obstacle Area. Players will take turns to throw wooden cubes using Armpal robot arm and try to destroy the wooden block wall.
A total of 3-N rounds are performed according to the number of players (the wooden block wall should be restored after each throw).1 point for each block shot, the player with the highest score wins!

 
Build a 3×4 wooden block wall in the Obstacle Area. Players will take turns to throw wooden cubes and try to put them into the Armpal Scale Box controlling the robot arm, 5 throws for each player.
3 points for Box 1, 10 points for Box 2, and -5 points for accidentally knocking down obstacle blocks.The player with the highest score wins when all the throws are done! 

 
9 Blocks in the Kick Off Area for each player to carry the wooden blocks to the Scoring Areas within the 3-min game. Successful transportation to the right areas gain points, and the player with the highest score wins when time’s up!
Each successful placement of a wooden block in the Central Area will get 1 point. The 3-Points Area and 5-Points Area are the Scramble Areas, and the very side with the block at the top of the pile in these areas when time’up will get the corresponding scores.When players accidentally knock down the wood cubes which are already in the Scramble Areas, corresponding points should be taken from their final scores. 
 
 


 
Two people operate a device (each person with one of the 2 handles) simultaneously , each group of players transports wooden blocks from the Stacking Area to the Central Area within the 3-min game, and the group with more wooden blocks wins when time’s up.
 



 
Players will pass the wooden blocks in a circle controlling their Armpals.Watch out! Don’t drop it!The 2 players who dropped the wooden block while passing it will fail the game and the other 2 players win! 
  The new Cannon Kit emphasizes the sense of simulation like the existing kit, so it will have a firing principle that is completely different from other firearm model toys —— this might probably the closest one to real ammunition in the current market!  For the new cannon kit, we designed ammunition containing bullet, case, primer, and even powder (replaced by spring energy storage). At the same time, we designed the components for delivery and return. And also, a series of institutions of shelling (throwing shells).  In addition to controlling the aiming of the robotic arm during operation, you will also use the two triggers on the handle of the control unit, one of which is used to fire and the other is used to deliver the bomb. 5 Rounds of ammunition can be loaded at once. *The Cannon Kit is currently undergoing verification and finishing work, will be available for purchase at special price for ALL BACKERS ON KICKSTARTER on pledge manager when the campaign ends. 

 
 
   Armpal is a set of wooden assembled, non plug-in tabletop game.Reducing the difficulty of the assembly process to the lowest level, the most complicated tool you’ll use is only a screwdriver, which make ArmPal well-adapted to a very wide age range.
 

 
 We have designed a multi-axis operating system for Armpal that is beyond imagination.  

You can easily use your hands to cooperate with the manipulation machinery to complete complex operations.
 If you want to experience the joy of manipulating machinery without leaving home, this set of tabletop game must be a very good choice.  As a set of mechanical-themed tabletop game, you can find armpal ingeniously integrates gear transmission, hydraulic transmission, pulleys, magnets, and multiple mechanisms. The visualized design enable us to enjoy the whole working process of movements with all the beautiful mechanical structures.   
 

 
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
 
 
  
  The optimization of the production process is also an important part of the design work.The laser cutting of the main wood knot structure can ensure smooth edges, and makes it easy to be taken apart without tools.
For better gaming experience and longer life of the mechanical structure, we’ve done a lot of work. Besides the strengthened structure and decreased wear and tear, special windows were designed to maintain the hydraulic transmission system with simple steps.In just a few steps, the entire hydraulic system can be rejuvenated to counteract possible liquid evaporation.    Our designers try to assign hand-made models to the attributes of the game. Such products can bring people back to the real world from mobile phones and the Internet, increasing face-to-face communication between people.The time spent playing with family or friends is full of happiness. And what is even more amazing is that this game is made by yourselves!",42.0,8,"2 Campaigns

<h2>A not so long time ago in a city not so far far away...</h2>
<p><span>The idea for SavySwap (spelled with one V on purpose) started  7 months ago by two ambitious lads Chris Coleman &amp; Cal Knight.  Both were living in Philadelphia at the time but complete strangers to one another. Chris was a college student who had attended the University of Colorado and later moved back to the East Coast to Washington DC to finish his education. With a background in journalism and a love for technology, Chris found himself writing and creating his own material for his techblog and eventually helping to found Strategic Media, a mobile strategies company. He knew he was destined to make a bigger impact in the world.  </span></p>
<p><span>Cal, who had been a part of a promising startup in 2010 which he sold to his partner was now working towards a new venture in the eCommerce space. He was determined to follow in the footsteps of the serial entrepreneur, Richard Branson, Calvin would not give up on this dream!</span></p>
<img alt=""Founders Cal Knight &amp; Chris Coleman"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/PprMil.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Cal Knight &amp; Chris Coleman""/><p> </p>
<h2>So what happened next?  </h2>
<p><span>Cal had started a  group in Philadelphia that Chris had joined. At the time, Chris had a really great idea for a campus-share company that would help college students buy and trade items with each other within their own campus. He was looking for a co-founder who could help execute this plan. While discussing the idea, what was supposed to be a 30 minute call turned into hours of brainstorming which turned into something much bigger than sharing items on a college campus.  </span></p>
<h2>The Problem and The Savy Solution!</h2>
<p><span>Cal &amp; Chris discussed how irritating it was to sell or list specialty items on sites like Ebay, Craigslist, and Amazon. After doing detailed research, they found that over 50% of the items on Ebay never receive a bid or a view, Amazon caters towards businesses selling its products to users and relatively ignores customer to customer selling and local businesses. And Craigslist...well we all know how difficult it can be to buy or sell things from trustworthy users. </span></p>
<p><span>There had to be a better way; a way to get connected with people with similar interests that you could get to know and trust in an exciting manner while leveraging your existing social network! What if there were profiles like Airbnb and a means of communicating instantly where you could work deals with other buyers and sellers? </span></p>
<h2>Changing The Way We Buy, Sell, and Trade Online</h2>
<p><span>The current eCommerce space is limited in the ways to get what you want. Currently users have the option to outright buy an item, or place a bid on them and that's it!  Well, what if you were looking for a new camera, but didn't necessarily have the money to get the one you wanted? What if someone had that exact camera you were eyeing, and was looking for an item that you already owned and didn't mind getting rid of...<strong>enter Swapping</strong>! You may then ask, what if the items didn't equal each other in value....<strong>enter Bartering!</strong>  For the unfamiliar...</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Barter</strong> is a system of exchange by which goods or services are directly exchanged for other goods or services without using a medium of exchange, such as money.</span></p>
<p><span>We were inspired by Kyle MacDonald, who in 2006 started with a paperclip and bartered his way into getting a house!!!! </span></p>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/KUSL7.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Kyle Macdonald with red paperclip""/><p><span>Bartering has been a part of our lives since the day we could communicate. You may remember going to school at a very young age with an apple for lunch and wanting that double chocolate fudge pudding Jennifer had. What did you do, did you stick with your apple in misery or did you try to work a deal with Jennifer to get what you wanted? The same concept can be applied to getting what we want from each other online!  </span></p>
<p>  </p>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/NJKSd.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Girls Bartering""/><h2>Why this Campaign?</h2>
<p><span>In the very quick amount of time we've developed <a href=""http://www.savyswap.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>SavySwap</span></a> we have received numerous amounts of positive feedback from advisors, investors, and successful startup entrepreneurs about the potential of the idea. We've put in hours upon days upon weeks of hard work to make strategic connections with people who are passionate about this idea like us and share the vision of how it can make a difference in the lives of people around the world.</span></p>
<p><span>The only thing holding us back from delivering a great product is money. We've already poured our own funds into getting mockups and the development of a prototype and wireframes; but, in order to deliver a finished, more polished product that people will love and can use to its fullest extent, we will need your help.</span></p>

<h2>What We're Asking for and What You Get in Return...</h2>
<p><span>Sourcebits roots are in working with larger corporations but they are looking to explore more freedom to pursue startup projects similar to ours. They created a great promo program for startups where they will take 50% upfront of the capital needed for an app to be designed and developed. We are asking for $35,000 to reach our goal of developing the fully functional SavySwap app. </span></p>
<p><span>As we mentioned, the cost for the project we are creating is $50,000. We will use $25,000 of the funds to put towards the app being developed and delivered to you, the people! We will then use the remaining money toward additional marketing to ensure we gain enough initial users to really enhance the SavySwap experience and validate the success of the application! </span></p>
<p><span>In return we have many unique and awesome personalized perks to thank you greatly for your contributions!!!!!! We wanted to really have our donors feel a sense of pride, passion, and excitement about SavySwap, so we are offering everlasting thank you's!</span></p>
<h2>Perks</h2>
<p><span>Rewards range from an elegant handwritten and embossed thank you card to a sleek decal from Stickermule with the SavySwap logo! </span>The larger your donation the more SavySwap swag you'll get.  Check out all the sweet perks you can claim on the right side bar of this campaign!  Remember even donating $1 is a big help and we thank you eternally!</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p><span>SavySwap will be extremely valuable to anyone who has ever wanted to find a better way to sell, buy, and trade items and services and refused to settle for the status quo. If you've ever felt like you couldn't make money from something you had because you would never find someone else who wanted it, or wanted to buy something you really loved but felt you couldn't get it because you couldn't find it or didn't have the money to afford it, SavySwap will save the day!  </span></p>
<p><span>Your contributions will help us revolutionize the way people connect with each other to get items they want. No longer will they have to settle for buying for that new SLR camera lens or Les Paul Guitar for stock value! You can work with other users to strike a deal and barter for what you think is fair! </span></p>
<p><span>SavySwap also couldn't come at a more important time! With a down economy and currency losing value we need to look to each other to build up ourselves and communities to be stronger than ever before!  History shows that when capital is weak, trading and bartering thrive!  We can use those skills we learned as children to bring excitement, fun, and communication into ecommerce!  SavySwap will be the place users can build their own personalized communities and get connected with others who have similar interests or hobbies!  Together we can enhance our experiences by taking action and leading the way in revolutionizing how ecommerce is engaged!  </span></p>

With a background in journalism and a love for technology, Chris found himself writing and creating his own material for his techblog and eventually helping to found Strategic Media, a mobile strategies company. He knew he was destined to make a bigger impact in the world.  
Cal, who had been a part of a promising startup in 2010 which he sold to his partner was now working towards a new venture in the eCommerce space. He was determined to follow in the footsteps of the serial entrepreneur, Richard Branson, Calvin would not give up on this dream!
 
So what happened next?  
Cal had started a  group in Philadelphia that Chris had joined. At the time, Chris had a really great idea for a campus-share company that would help college students buy and trade items with each other within their own campus. He was looking for a co-founder who could help execute this plan. While discussing the idea, what was supposed to be a 30 minute call turned into hours of brainstorming which turned into something much bigger than sharing items on a college campus.  
The Problem and The Savy Solution!
Cal & Chris discussed how irritating it was to sell or list specialty items on sites like Ebay, Craigslist, and Amazon. After doing detailed research, they found that over 50% of the items on Ebay never receive a bid or a view, Amazon caters towards businesses selling its products to users and relatively ignores customer to customer selling and local businesses. And Craigslist...well we all know how difficult it can be to buy or sell things from trustworthy users. 
There had to be a better way; a way to get connected with people with similar interests that you could get to know and trust in an exciting manner while leveraging your existing social network! What if there were profiles like Airbnb and a means of communicating instantly where you could work deals with other buyers and sellers? 
Changing The Way We Buy, Sell, and Trade Online
The current eCommerce space is limited in the ways to get what you want. Currently users have the option to outright buy an item, or place a bid on them and that's it!  Well, what if you were looking for a new camera, but didn't necessarily have the money to get the one you wanted? What if someone had that exact camera you were eyeing, and was looking for an item that you already owned and didn't mind getting rid of...enter Swapping! You may then ask, what if the items didn't equal each other in value....enter Bartering!  For the unfamiliar...
Barter is a system of exchange by which goods or services are directly exchanged for other goods or services without using a medium of exchange, such as money.
We were inspired by Kyle MacDonald, who in 2006 started with a paperclip and bartered his way into getting a house!!!! 
Bartering has been a part of our lives since the day we could communicate. You may remember going to school at a very young age with an apple for lunch and wanting that double chocolate fudge pudding Jennifer had. What did you do, did you stick with your apple in misery or did you try to work a deal with Jennifer to get what you wanted? The same concept can be applied to getting what we want from each other online!  
  
Why this Campaign?
In the very quick amount of time we've developed SavySwap we have received numerous amounts of positive feedback from advisors, investors, and successful startup entrepreneurs about the potential of the idea. We've put in hours upon days upon weeks of hard work to make strategic connections with people who are passionate about this idea like us and share the vision of how it can make a difference in the lives of people around the world.
The only thing holding us back from delivering a great product is money. We've already poured our own funds into getting mockups and the development of a prototype and wireframes; but, in order to deliver a finished, more polished product that people will love and can use to its fullest extent, we will need your help.

 


 


 
 
 
About The Developers 
The contributions that we receive through this funding campaign will allow us to work with a great and well renowned mobile development company, Sourcebits!  They have developed apps for companies such as Twitpic, Velib, Coca-Cola, General Electric, IBM, and Intel!
After our initial consulting session with the technical team at Sourcebits, they were excited to work on a cutting edge app with our team and bring our idea of social bartering to life! However, you pay for what you get, and working with a professional team such as this is not cheap. The cost of the project will be $50,000. Not only will your contributions allow us to work with this A+ team to develop the app, but also ensure the best user experience for you!

 
 

What We're Asking for and What You Get in Return...
Sourcebits roots are in working with larger corporations but they are looking to explore more freedom to pursue startup projects similar to ours. They created a great promo program for startups where they will take 50% upfront of the capital needed for an app to be designed and developed. We are asking for $35,000 to reach our goal of developing the fully functional SavySwap app. 
As we mentioned, the cost for the project we are creating is $50,000. We will use $25,000 of the funds to put towards the app being developed and delivered to you, the people! We will then use the remaining money toward additional marketing to ensure we gain enough initial users to really enhance the SavySwap experience and validate the success of the application! 
In return we have many unique and awesome personalized perks to thank you greatly for your contributions!!!!!! We wanted to really have our donors feel a sense of pride, passion, and excitement about SavySwap, so we are offering everlasting thank you's!
Perks
Rewards range from an elegant handwritten and embossed thank you card to a sleek decal from Stickermule with the SavySwap logo! The larger your donation the more SavySwap swag you'll get.  Check out all the sweet perks you can claim on the right side bar of this campaign!  Remember even donating $1 is a big help and we thank you eternally!
 
 



 
The Impact
SavySwap will be extremely valuable to anyone who has ever wanted to find a better way to sell, buy, and trade items and services and refused to settle for the status quo. If you've ever felt like you couldn't make money from something you had because you would never find someone else who wanted it, or wanted to buy something you really loved but felt you couldn't get it because you couldn't find it or didn't have the money to afford it, SavySwap will save the day!  
Your contributions will help us revolutionize the way people connect with each other to get items they want. No longer will they have to settle for buying for that new SLR camera lens or Les Paul Guitar for stock value! You can work with other users to strike a deal and barter for what you think is fair! 
SavySwap also couldn't come at a more important time! With a down economy and currency losing value we need to look to each other to build up ourselves and communities to be stronger than ever before!  History shows that when capital is weak, trading and bartering thrive!  We can use those skills we learned as children to bring excitement, fun, and communication into ecommerce!  SavySwap will be the place users can build their own personalized communities and get connected with others who have similar interests or hobbies!  Together we can enhance our experiences by taking action and leading the way in revolutionizing how ecommerce is engaged!

<p>And this one,</p>
<h4>Review from Thomas S, ""I am honestly impressed with these Knife Edge bits!""</h4>
<p>I backed a lot of projects, at last count I have had about 65 that have been successfully funded, and almost 100 that have not been. <strong>The knife edge bits that you have created, are the first rewards I have ever received from a Kickstarter project, where I have genuinely felt like they will improve my quality of life.</strong> They work amazingly well, and I was finally able to unscrew a door hinge, where someone previously had almost destroyed the head of the screws. It was one of those little irritations that I kept meaning to fix, but none of my bits had enough “bite”. When I got my new Knife Edge bits through the post, it was the first problem I tackled with them.</p>
<h4><b><a href=""https://knifeedgebit.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">About Our Story</a></b></h4>
<p>Hello, First let us state that we have spent most of our lives working with tools. It is important to us that you understand that we do know what we are talking about. We had to experience the problems before we could seek the remedy. We are not wasting your valuable time. We would not do that. </p>
<p>If you want a short third-party version of our bit, here is a nice write-up on <a href=""http://www.coolthings.com/knife-edge-pjillips-screwdriver-bit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.coolthings.com/knife-edge-pjillips-screwdriver-bit/</a> </p>
<p>Something we would like to emphasize is that if you use our Knife Edge® bit to begin with, you are very unlikely to ever see another stripped screw head from your work. It does make a nice removal tool but that is not it's primary function. VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ. This is a professional grade hardened steel tool. It is very likely that the screws you are working with are much softer so it is important that you start out slowly with the KnifeEdge® Bit and give your screw a chance to turn. This will give you the best chance of success.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading on.</p>
<p>What if we told you that we have the one tool that you have always wanted? The one you thought you could never have because it didn't exist, before now? The instant you try it, you will want it, and once you have it, you will protect it, because losing it would make you far less effective like you were before this. If you are like most of us, this is a tool that you think you already own several of, but you hate to use. This tool is (reluctantly) used at least as often as any other but often with problems and words you would not want your mother to hear that come directly from its use. This tool was NOT designed to be used as it is today, but no one has ever explained to you why, until now. We looked around and tried everything we could find. What we found was that even though everyone we have ever talked to hates the way this tool works, No one had ever bothered to make the needed design improvements, so we did! Aside from the most basic shape that had to be maintained in order to still fit Phillips screws we made several major changes in almost every aspect of its design so that it was satisfactorily updated to be efficient, effective and finally, gratifying to use. Odd's are you have old ones with you whether you are at home, work or driving. We are talking about Phillips screwdrivers. Specifically Phillips bits, the part that actually touches the screw to make it turn. Our advanced new ""KnifeEdge®"" Bit for Phillips screws works with new screws or damaged old screws. Oily, rusty or dirty screws. Screws that before now had to be painstakingly removed and thrown away. Again, It works with most damaged, greasy, oily or wet screws the same way it does when you are in a clean, dry shop with new screws. It requires less effort than ever before and it works the same reliable way whether you use it for putting a project together or taking it apart. Sounds great, doesn't it?</p>
<p>What you are about to discover can be life-changing. (Your tool use may vary.) </p>

<h2> </h2>
<p><b>Damaged Screws Easily Turned By KnifeEdge® Bit</b></p>
<p>Before we begin we would like to share with you the attributes we required of ourselves for our tool to be worthy of your support. </p>
<p>1. You should instantly notice the superiority when you first use it without any doubt. </p>
<p>2. It should save you time and/or money. Both would be best.</p>
<p>3. It should save you energy and help protect you from injury. </p>
<p>4. You should want to think of it as your, ”only bit” after one use. You realize its value and will not let the ""KnifeEdge®"" Bit out of your sight once you have it. Old out of date bits will be retired. You'll have to experience it to fully understand.</p>
<p>As you will see we are proud to say that we have successfully accomplished all 4. </p>
<p>Most of us learned at an early age the basics of tools, which hammers worked with nails, which saws cut wood or metal and certain screwdrivers worked with certain screws, right? Experience teaches us that if you apply your hammer properly you will drive a nail straight into your work every time as desired. Conversely, anyone who has ever tried to drive a Phillips screw knows the frustrating disappointment of using your best efforts trying to complete the simple task of turning a screw, only to watch that screw often become unusable as the bit pushes itself out and destructs the screw head right before your eyes. This out of date tool should be called the ""Screw Destroyer"", not screwdriver because it often destroys more than it drives. So now you’re stuck and it isn’t your fault! Here's proof.</p>

<p><b>Henry Phillips Patent For Driver To ""Cam out"" Or Push Out When ""It"" Thinks It's Finished, Not You. It Served A Purpose Then. Now It's The Cause Of Your Problems.</b></p>
<p>Does this sound familiar? Do you have that little job on your list that you promised to take care of before you head out, only to be stopped in your tracks by a stripped screw head because the bit came out and destroyed it before you were finished? You are left with a screw that is not out and it’s not in. It’s just…there! You bite your tongue to not get in trouble but we all know the feeling, right? Now you either have to leave it for later or your plans have to change.</p>
<p>These bits will change that.</p>

<p><b>Made For Todays Phillips Screws. It's Like Nothing Else You've Seen!</b></p>
<p>The ""KnifeEdge®"" Bit Will Be Your Only Bit of Choice. </p>
<p>We have perfected the design of the ""KnifeEdge®"" Bit. The Trade Mark has been issued. The Utility Patents have been filed with the U.S. Patent Office. This is a serious professional grade tool. As such we will only make professional quality bits using the best materials and machining techniques available. This is important to understand because due to their very complex patent pending design these KnifeEdge® Bits are much more expensive to make than the old style Phillips bits of the past. Those bits are generally made by stamping them out in mass quantities at speeds too fast to see. Our bit is much more multifaceted, machined and the attention to detail is much higher with closer tolerances so those methods simply would not work for us. An example might be if you think about a table leg, one that is basically straight from end to end costs much less to make than one with lots of details that takes more time, labor and expertise so while our cost is more, they are worth every penny simply because they are so much easier to use, should last a lot longer and offer a much better result. In short, ours actually work!</p>
<p>The difference in cost is a small price to pay when compared to how much better the “KnifeEdge®” Bit performs. Think of all the frustration you’ll no longer experience using this bit and they are less expensive than the rescue bits mentioned above. Also, Henry's old bits do not last as long as preliminary tests have shown ours do because ""KnifeEdge®"" Bits do not bounce in and out of the screw heads beating themselves to death like before while they destroy your screws which is what greatly accelerates the wear and tear to Henry's old bits. </p>
<p>We are offering the most common sizes, a No.1, a No.2 in either a 1.35-inch length that fits a standard magnetic bit holder or as a 2-inch power bit that fits most power-driven drills and chucks as well as others. FYI Most screws take a No.2 bit. If they are smaller screws they will require a No.1 bit. Using the correct size, as with most things, is critically important.  If you are not sure we suggest you buy both and use the one that fits. This way your job will be easy to complete.</p>

I backed a lot of projects, at last count I have had about 65 that have been successfully funded, and almost 100 that have not been. The knife edge bits that you have created, are the first rewards I have ever received from a Kickstarter project, where I have genuinely felt like they will improve my quality of life. They work amazingly well, and I was finally able to unscrew a door hinge, where someone previously had almost destroyed the head of the screws. It was one of those little irritations that I kept meaning to fix, but none of my bits had enough “bite”. When I got my new Knife Edge bits through the post, it was the first problem I tackled with them.
About Our Story
Hello, First let us state that we have spent most of our lives working with tools. It is important to us that you understand that we do know what we are talking about. We had to experience the problems before we could seek the remedy. We are not wasting your valuable time. We would not do that. 
If you want a short third-party version of our bit, here is a nice write-up on http://www.coolthings.com/knife-edge-pjillips-screwdriver-bit/ 
Something we would like to emphasize is that if you use our Knife Edge® bit to begin with, you are very unlikely to ever see another stripped screw head from your work. It does make a nice removal tool but that is not it's primary function. VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ. This is a professional grade hardened steel tool. It is very likely that the screws you are working with are much softer so it is important that you start out slowly with the KnifeEdge® Bit and give your screw a chance to turn. This will give you the best chance of success.
Thank you for reading on.
What if we told you that we have the one tool that you have always wanted? The one you thought you could never have because it didn't exist, before now? The instant you try it, you will want it, and once you have it, you will protect it, because losing it would make you far less effective like you were before this. If you are like most of us, this is a tool that you think you already own several of, but you hate to use. This tool is (reluctantly) used at least as often as any other but often with problems and words you would not want your mother to hear that come directly from its use. This tool was NOT designed to be used as it is today, but no one has ever explained to you why, until now. We looked around and tried everything we could find. What we found was that even though everyone we have ever talked to hates the way this tool works, No one had ever bothered to make the needed design improvements, so we did! Aside from the most basic shape that had to be maintained in order to still fit Phillips screws we made several major changes in almost every aspect of its design so that it was satisfactorily updated to be efficient, effective and finally, gratifying to use. Odd's are you have old ones with you whether you are at home, work or driving. We are talking about Phillips screwdrivers. Specifically Phillips bits, the part that actually touches the screw to make it turn. Our advanced new ""KnifeEdge®"" Bit for Phillips screws works with new screws or damaged old screws. Oily, rusty or dirty screws. Screws that before now had to be painstakingly removed and thrown away. Again, It works with most damaged, greasy, oily or wet screws the same way it does when you are in a clean, dry shop with new screws. It requires less effort than ever before and it works the same reliable way whether you use it for putting a project together or taking it apart. Sounds great, doesn't it?
What you are about to discover can be life-changing. (Your tool use may vary.) 
 


 
Damaged Screws Easily Turned By KnifeEdge® Bit
Before we begin we would like to share with you the attributes we required of ourselves for our tool to be worthy of your support. 
1. You should instantly notice the superiority when you first use it without any doubt. 
2. It should save you time and/or money. Both would be best.
3. It should save you energy and help protect you from injury. 
4. You should want to think of it as your, ”only bit” after one use. You realize its value and will not let the ""KnifeEdge®"" Bit out of your sight once you have it. Old out of date bits will be retired. You'll have to experience it to fully understand.
As you will see we are proud to say that we have successfully accomplished all 4. 
Most of us learned at an early age the basics of tools, which hammers worked with nails, which saws cut wood or metal and certain screwdrivers worked with certain screws, right? Experience teaches us that if you apply your hammer properly you will drive a nail straight into your work every time as desired. Conversely, anyone who has ever tried to drive a Phillips screw knows the frustrating disappointment of using your best efforts trying to complete the simple task of turning a screw, only to watch that screw often become unusable as the bit pushes itself out and destructs the screw head right before your eyes. This out of date tool should be called the ""Screw Destroyer"", not screwdriver because it often destroys more than it drives. So now you’re stuck and it isn’t your fault! Here's proof.
 

 
Henry Phillips Patent For Driver To ""Cam out"" Or Push Out When ""It"" Thinks It's Finished, Not You. It Served A Purpose Then. Now It's The Cause Of Your Problems.
Does this sound familiar? Do you have that little job on your list that you promised to take care of before you head out, only to be stopped in your tracks by a stripped screw head because the bit came out and destroyed it before you were finished? You are left with a screw that is not out and it’s not in. It’s just…there! You bite your tongue to not get in trouble but we all know the feeling, right? Now you either have to leave it for later or your plans have to change.
These bits will change that.

 

 
Made For Todays Phillips Screws. It's Like Nothing Else You've Seen!
The ""KnifeEdge®"" Bit Will Be Your Only Bit of Choice. 
We have perfected the design of the ""KnifeEdge®"" Bit. The Trade Mark has been issued. The Utility Patents have been filed with the U.S. Patent Office. This is a serious professional grade tool. As such we will only make professional quality bits using the best materials and machining techniques available. This is important to understand because due to their very complex patent pending design these KnifeEdge® Bits are much more expensive to make than the old style Phillips bits of the past. Those bits are generally made by stamping them out in mass quantities at speeds too fast to see. Our bit is much more multifaceted, machined and the attention to detail is much higher with closer tolerances so those methods simply would not work for us. An example might be if you think about a table leg, one that is basically straight from end to end costs much less to make than one with lots of details that takes more time, labor and expertise so while our cost is more, they are worth every penny simply because they are so much easier to use, should last a lot longer and offer a much better result. In short, ours actually work!
The difference in cost is a small price to pay when compared to how much better the “KnifeEdge®” Bit performs. Think of all the frustration you’ll no longer experience using this bit and they are less expensive than the rescue bits mentioned above. Also, Henry's old bits do not last as long as preliminary tests have shown ours do because ""KnifeEdge®"" Bits do not bounce in and out of the screw heads beating themselves to death like before while they destroy your screws which is what greatly accelerates the wear and tear to Henry's old bits. 
We are offering the most common sizes, a No.1, a No.2 in either a 1.35-inch length that fits a standard magnetic bit holder or as a 2-inch power bit that fits most power-driven drills and chucks as well as others. FYI Most screws take a No.2 bit. If they are smaller screws they will require a No.1 bit. Using the correct size, as with most things, is critically important.  If you are not sure we suggest you buy both and use the one that fits. This way your job will be easy to complete.
Please Follow Us On Facebook. Go here and share with everyone. It will only take a minute and it makes a big difference!
 

A Final But Important Thought:
During the last four years, we have worked with many people who without their skillful help we would have never made it this far. We appreciate them all tremendously and are forever thankful. We often heard from those who have worked with us in developing the ""KnifeEdge®"" Bit that once you know about it, once you've tried it, every time you need to turn a Phillips screw, you will be glad you have one. Those that had our prototypes similarly said they were very relieved to have the right tool for the job. We have now heard similar statements from many of the happy people who supported our Kickstarter campaign.
The instant you try it, you will see why this could easily become the industry standard. Get yours now and please share us with your friends so we can offer these to everyone as soon as possible! Thank you for your time and support! We seriously appreciate you!

<h2><strong>It's Not Just An App...It's A Movement!<br/></strong></h2>
<p>Won't you join us in our quest to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help the good people of the world find the food they really want and not get a geography lesson or a bunch of outdated listings when they search.</li>
<li>Give restaurant owners (especially the mom and pops) a powerful, new way to promote their best dishes and thus grow their businesses and their contribution to the economy.</li>
<li>Assist travelers and people new to an area in cutting through the confusion and finding the truly good places to eat.</li>
<li>Give people who like to post what they're eating online a solid community and culture that transcends any single social network.</li>
<li>Stop indecision among all the groups of friends, co-workers, and business associates who spend too much of their lunch breaks figuring out where to eat.</li>
<li>Create an app and online database that makes it fast, easy, and outright tantalizing to look for food.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Ultimate Food App Story</h2>
<p>We developed the concept of the “Ultimate Food App Project” while traveling with our families and for work. We found it difficult to discover great food because the web is designed towards locating restaurants, not awesome dishes.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to find exactly what to eat without having to sift through a large mindless list of different restaurants online. Wouldn’t it make more sense to find and see the actual dishes that you want? Wouldn't it be great if the food selections nearby simply appeared on your smartphone, with little or no searching at all. </p>
<p><strong>The Ultimate Food App focuses on the actual food, which makes finding your next great meal easy.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We aim to create the largest and most useful, socially driven menu in the world, served through your smartphone. A large “potluck” where <em>Users</em> and <em>Restaurants</em> can contribute dish postings to a menu of great food that’s nearby. The Ultimate Food App will forever change the way you find the best food around.</p>
<p>We believe that <strong>EVERYONE</strong> should have the ability to find whatever food they want, wherever they are. We also want to connect restaurants and food vendors with you, by providing a platform to showcase their best dishes. The Ultimate Food App is designed to do all of these things and more.</p>
<p>We have worked hard on developing the concept, and built a working prototype. WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT for the next critical step in the creation of this amazing app.</p>
<p>It's more than an app. It's Revolutionary! It's a Movement. It's a Food Culture!</p>

<p>When you open our app, the first thing you see is the food near you sorted by relevance…not just the number of “likes” but also ranked by review.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something in particular, we offer various ways to search. </p>
<p>Just like with food, users can also add and review restaurants if the restaurant isn’t already listed.  Every restaurant in the world gets a simple, free listing.</p>
<p>But, if they really want to create a noticable presence, the restaurants can upgrade. </p>
<p>We’ve come to realize that the social element is what’s missing from the other food apps.  The app lets you add photos that you can post along with the food on whatever social networks you use.  All of them with one tap!  You can even email them to people who are not on your networks.</p>

<p>2.      People like you submit dishes and restaurants.</p>
<p>3.      Restaurants submit their best dishes</p>
<p>All three work together through our app.</p>
<p>It goes beyond the app.  It’s a MOVEMENT and a CULTURE!</p>
<p>And EVERYONE can use it to make the biggest and best Social Menu in the world!</p>
<p>Isn’t that REVOLUTIONARY?</p>

<h2>What We Need to Make This App a Reality</h2>
<p><img alt=""piggy bank"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.richmonddance.co.uk/Blue%20Piggy%20bank.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As of this moment, the most powerful means for anyone to help make this app a reality for all of us, is to support and contribute to this ambitious project on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>Our project requires $30K USD. All the funds will be used to build the core functionality of the Ultimate Food App. This requires design creation, technical development, coding, alpha build, beta testing, and the actual launch itself. All funds in excess of our funding requirments will be used to add additional features to enhance your experience and expand the reach of the app. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Stretch Goals</strong></h2>
<p>Our primary funding goal is for the core functionality of the app.  Pretty much what you see in the videos above.  But like many campaigns, we've added some ""stretch goals"" for additional capabilities that we can add, should you, the good people of the indiegogo community see fit to provide us the funds.</p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goal #1:  Android Version</strong></h3>
<p>It is our strategy to increase the likelihood of successful funding of this project by setting an initial goal to develop only for the iOS platform.  It was a decision based upon the popularity of the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. </p>
<p>However, we realize that a lot of you use Android devices (as do many of us).  Plus Banshee Cloud believes that everyone should have a choice as to which devices they want to use and not be forced into any system by software developers.</p>
<p>So while this is technically a stretch goal, we truly believe that The Ultimate Food App will not be complete until it is available in an Android version.  And as Android users, we are genuinely upset when the Android version of an app doesn't work as well as the iOS version.  So we want to assure you that when we develop ANYTHING cross platform, it will look and work and be just as fun to use as any other version.</p>
<p>If our funding reaches the $50,000 level, we will immediately begin development of an Android version of The Ultimate Food App.</p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goal #2: Web Interface</strong></h3>
<p>If we genuinely want to make our app available to everyone worldwide, we have to acknowledge that not everyone has nor even wants a smartphone.  But many people do search for restaurants on their computers.  Plus there are several other mobile operating systems which have web-browsing capability. </p>
<p>To make the app accessible to anyone with internet access, we will build a web interface with the full capabilities of the app if our funding reaches the $65,000 level. </p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goal #3: Windows Phone</strong></h3>
<p>We cannot overemphasize how strongly we feel about giving people the right to choose their mobile computing platform.  With the upcoming release of Windows Phone 8, we want to make the Ultimate Food App available to anyone using Microsoft's new mobile operating system.  To this end, we plan to develop for Windows Phone with $85,000 in backing.</p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goal #4: Food Bank Connect</strong></h3>
<p>While the United States is the wealthiest country on earth, it is deplorable to see that USDA statistics show a 14.6% increase in “food insecurity” nationwide from 2008-2010.  The increase is nearly 20% in some Southern states.  (USDA. Coleman-Jensen, A., Nord, M., Andrews, M., &amp; Carlson, S. <em>Household Food Security in the United States in 2010)  </em></p>
<p>In our community and throughout much of the nation, food bank officials will tell you that they are seeing more middle class families turning to charitable outlets to find basic sustenance.</p>
<p>We believe that not only is it our civic duty to address this issue, but also that we could not in good conscience call it The Ultimate Food App if we could not find a way to use this technology to help you feed the hungry in your community.  We propose to create a capability within The Ultimate Food App that allows users and restaurant owners alike connect to food banks nearby.  Whether you run a licensed commercial kitchen or have extra groceries at home, you will be able to inform one or more food banks that you have surplus food and make arrangements to get the food to where it’s needed most.</p>
<p><em>We will not charge any user, restaurant, or food bank to use this system.</em></p>
<p>At a funding level of $105,000, we plan to develop this vital service.</p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goal #5:  Dietary Edition</strong></h3>
<p>Just like the app itself, the inspiration for this capability came from personal experience.  At lunchtime one day, Rene and his companions tried to use an app to find food, only to realize that everyone in the car had dietary considerations.  And none of their mobile apps could search or filter upon factors such as no red meat, low carbs, lactose free, etc.</p>
<p>Since the preliminary design for The Ultimate Food App had already started, it occurred to us that it would be a great idea to come up with an app that could take dietary data and locate dishes that meet the user's requirements. </p>
<p>Restaurants, regardless of their subscription status with us can submit the dietary profiles for no charge.</p>
<p>We plan development of this capability at $135,000.</p>
<p><img alt=""Stretch Goals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/474911/pictures/full/20121004200352-Stretch_Goal_Thermometer.png?1349406243"" src="""" style="""" title=""Stretch Goals""/> </p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>What's in a Name?</strong></h2>
<p>With apologies to Mr. Shakespeare and Ms. Juliet, while our app is a great concept to us, naming it is a different story altogether.  Rene thinks it should be called Meal-O-Cator and Rodney thinks it's FoodLync.  Rather than letting them bicker over this, we've decided to leave it up to our backers.  So if you pledge $10 or more to our project, you get to vote on its name.  You'll see them asking anyone they see about this, but the contributors are the ones in the dimly lit room who really call the shots.  And yes, that means you can also vote to keep calling it The Ultimate Food App.  It certainly would save us having to do a lot of new artwork.</p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/BG0-QLP-rC8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""foodlync vs. Meal-O-Cator""><img alt=""foodlync vs. Meal-O-Cator"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/474997/pictures/full/20121004213842-POSTER_foodlync_vs_Meal-O-Cator.png?1349411928"" src="""" style="""" title=""foodlync vs. Meal-O-Cator""/></a> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WE LOVE PERKS!</h2>
<p>In gratitude for your contirbution, we are offering some very cool perks.</p>
<p>But first a few things to point out...</p>
<p><em>We are not giving away iPhones. The iPhones in the images below represent the app. Nor are we giving away the plate, silverware, and napkin.  They are just illustrations.  Foodie Swag logo imprints are simulated.  While we will do all we can to portray these items accurately, the actual appearance of items may vary.  Actual appearance of Rene and Rodney certainly will vary.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<h3><strong>About the Foodie Swag</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, we are giving out some really cool Foodie Swag to our contributors.  But we want to emphasize that it's more than branded merchandise.  Anything with the app logo on it is specifically designed to  be useful to Foodies and anyone else who goes out to eat. But more importantly, the Foodie Swag is meant to serve as <strong>campaign material</strong> for the Movement.  We've given some serious thought to what we're giving out. </p>
<p>For instance, look at the Ultimate Food App Sticky Notes.  Everyone jots down notes and leaves them stuck in a prominent spot.  It helps them remember important stuff.  But at the same time, you can also give the people that wander into your cubicle a hint about how they can join our Movement and add the food they love for everyone to find.</p>
<p>And the hand sanitizer.  If you go out to eat, there's no need to leave your hard won seat to practice good personal hygiene.  That girl dining alone at the table next to yours will see your bottle and ask about the app.  She'll probably even ask to borrow your phone so she can post her Panini Special on Facebook.  The app truly does bring people together! </p>

<h2>Statement of Transparency </h2>
<p><img alt=""handshake"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ebyline.biz/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/handshake.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>(Let's get serious for a moment...)</p>
<p>There has been a lot of press lately on how tech companies, including some of the most successfully funded projects in crowdfunding history, have either run out of money or are announcing serious delays in the delivery of their product.  We are uncomfortable with this trend, as we see crowdfunding and Indiegogo in particular as an important and necessary alternative means of financing tech projects.  To this end, we are undertaking the development of the Ultimate Food App with the understanding that our success or failure will reflect upon the viability of all other technology and software development projects that are on Indiegogo, whether at this time or in the future.</p>
<p>To substantially increase the probability of success, we plan to apply key principles of project management that our team has utilized in past capacities for software and web development in several industries, in sectors ranging from manufacturing to government, and applications ranging from inventory management to social networking.  Key milestones have been established and controls will be utilized to assure conformity to standards of scheduling and the quality of deliverables.</p>
<p>In addition to strict management of deadlines and development standards, we are addressing the issue of financial sustainability through the application for planning methodologies for close monitoring of budget variances and cash flow projections.  Of course, none of this would be of use if not for our foundation of a comprehensive budget for the project. </p>
<p>Even outside of Indiegogo, many software developers primarily focus on the design and coding of the product to the neglect of the marketing of what they produce.  Our approach stems from the realization that without a defined market and promotional activity to connect to that market, any for profit venture will inevitably be received with a lukewarm response at best.  Before even the founding of our company, the members of our management team have always taken the approach of identifying a need in a market and creating a product around that need.  And of course, with the primary markets segments for our product identified, our promotional activities can not only be planned but also properly accounted for in our budgeting process.</p>
<p>While these macro-level financial plans are simply overall good business practice, we also have to be cognizant of some key considerations when operating under the specific constraints of an environment such as Indiegogo.  Specifically, with necessity to hit one’s set funding goal, the primary issue encountered is the establishment of a realistic and sound target.  Our project budget has been created for the development of the minimum functionality required to create a product with the right features to address the market needs at hand.  And so our goal becomes that much more attainable. </p>
<p>But we also understand that to settle for minimum functionality is to compromise the need to strive for excellence.  And so we have defined a series of additional features and capabilities that we feel are logical steps in the continued advancement of our product.  Fortunately, Indiegogo and the world of crowdfunding have given rise to the concept of the stretch goals.  We have seen numerous projects successfully implement the idea of setting a series of progressive goals, to be implemented as additional funds are pledged by their funders. </p>
<p>Our goals reflect this approach.  The initial funding target is specifically for the development of an app for Apple’s pervasive iOS platform.  The scope of the project reflects the minimal, yet very useful features of the iOS application.  And the scope has been locked in order to develop the product within the funding goal. </p>
<p>Past the initial goal, stretch goals have been established, most notably the first such goal involving development of an Android version of the app.  It has always been our intention to include users of devices in this fast growing market.  Which incidentally, includes many of our team members.</p>
<p>So in summary, while our Indiegogo project will last just over a month in duration, it is the culmination of a planning process which has taken the better part of a year.  The project itself is only part of a larger entity that includes our marketing plan and ongoing development well beyond the stretch goals of the project.  While predicting the future in detail is in the realm of science fiction, we feel that we have developed plans and controls that will allow us to execute the development and marketing of what we see as an incredibly viable product. </p>
<p>But what reaches far beyond our business and the app itself is the fact that the true key to success is not our software, but how its use can affect the lives of people throughout the world.  The interaction between the users and the restaurants and food vendors is what drives this.  We sincerely believe that what we are helping to create is a movement and a culture of sharing and helping and improving how people dine out worldwide.  This truly is what makes our app unique and different from all the other apps currently on the market.</p>
<p>And so the success of our app and the database of food is in the end dependent upon how well our funders, and subsequently our users understand its potential and use it.  Fortunately, this is an area that is completely under the control of the community of funders on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Won't you join us in our quest to:

Help the good people of the world find the food they really want and not get a geography lesson or a bunch of outdated listings when they search.
Give restaurant owners (especially the mom and pops) a powerful, new way to promote their best dishes and thus grow their businesses and their contribution to the economy.
Assist travelers and people new to an area in cutting through the confusion and finding the truly good places to eat.
Give people who like to post what they're eating online a solid community and culture that transcends any single social network.
Stop indecision among all the groups of friends, co-workers, and business associates who spend too much of their lunch breaks figuring out where to eat.
Create an app and online database that makes it fast, easy, and outright tantalizing to look for food.

 
The Ultimate Food App Story
We developed the concept of the “Ultimate Food App Project” while traveling with our families and for work. We found it difficult to discover great food because the web is designed towards locating restaurants, not awesome dishes.
It’s difficult to find exactly what to eat without having to sift through a large mindless list of different restaurants online. Wouldn’t it make more sense to find and see the actual dishes that you want? Wouldn't it be great if the food selections nearby simply appeared on your smartphone, with little or no searching at all. 
The Ultimate Food App focuses on the actual food, which makes finding your next great meal easy.
 
We aim to create the largest and most useful, socially driven menu in the world, served through your smartphone. A large “potluck” where Users and Restaurants can contribute dish postings to a menu of great food that’s nearby. The Ultimate Food App will forever change the way you find the best food around.
We believe that EVERYONE should have the ability to find whatever food they want, wherever they are. We also want to connect restaurants and food vendors with you, by providing a platform to showcase their best dishes. The Ultimate Food App is designed to do all of these things and more.
We have worked hard on developing the concept, and built a working prototype. WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT for the next critical step in the creation of this amazing app.
It's more than an app. It's Revolutionary! It's a Movement. It's a Food Culture!
PLEASE JOIN US AND HELP FUND OUR VISION!
As seen on:

 
How Does It Work?

When you open our app, the first thing you see is the food near you sorted by relevance…not just the number of “likes” but also ranked by review.
If you’re looking for something in particular, we offer various ways to search. 
Just like with food, users can also add and review restaurants if the restaurant isn’t already listed.  Every restaurant in the world gets a simple, free listing.
But, if they really want to create a noticable presence, the restaurants can upgrade. 
We’ve come to realize that the social element is what’s missing from the other food apps.  The app lets you add photos that you can post along with the food on whatever social networks you use.  All of them with one tap!  You can even email them to people who are not on your networks.
 
The Social Menu - What Really Makes the App Ultimate

We call it the Social Menu.
How do we make sure that there are enough dishes and restaurants?
It’s easy as 1-2-3.
1.      We start with the most comprehensive listing of restaurants online.
2.      People like you submit dishes and restaurants.
3.      Restaurants submit their best dishes
All three work together through our app.
It goes beyond the app.  It’s a MOVEMENT and a CULTURE!
And EVERYONE can use it to make the biggest and best Social Menu in the world!
Isn’t that REVOLUTIONARY?
 
 


What We Need to Make This App a Reality

As of this moment, the most powerful means for anyone to help make this app a reality for all of us, is to support and contribute to this ambitious project on Indiegogo.
Our project requires $30K USD. All the funds will be used to build the core functionality of the Ultimate Food App. This requires design creation, technical development, coding, alpha build, beta testing, and the actual launch itself. All funds in excess of our funding requirments will be used to add additional features to enhance your experience and expand the reach of the app. 
 
 
The Stretch Goals
Our primary funding goal is for the core functionality of the app.  Pretty much what you see in the videos above.  But like many campaigns, we've added some ""stretch goals"" for additional capabilities that we can add, should you, the good people of the indiegogo community see fit to provide us the funds.
Stretch Goal #1:  Android Version
It is our strategy to increase the likelihood of successful funding of this project by setting an initial goal to develop only for the iOS platform.  It was a decision based upon the popularity of the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. 
However, we realize that a lot of you use Android devices (as do many of us).  Plus Banshee Cloud believes that everyone should have a choice as to which devices they want to use and not be forced into any system by software developers.
So while this is technically a stretch goal, we truly believe that The Ultimate Food App will not be complete until it is available in an Android version.  And as Android users, we are genuinely upset when the Android version of an app doesn't work as well as the iOS version.  So we want to assure you that when we develop ANYTHING cross platform, it will look and work and be just as fun to use as any other version.
If our funding reaches the $50,000 level, we will immediately begin development of an Android version of The Ultimate Food App.
Stretch Goal #2: Web Interface
If we genuinely want to make our app available to everyone worldwide, we have to acknowledge that not everyone has nor even wants a smartphone.  But many people do search for restaurants on their computers.  Plus there are several other mobile operating systems which have web-browsing capability. 
To make the app accessible to anyone with internet access, we will build a web interface with the full capabilities of the app if our funding reaches the $65,000 level. 
Stretch Goal #3: Windows Phone
We cannot overemphasize how strongly we feel about giving people the right to choose their mobile computing platform.  With the upcoming release of Windows Phone 8, we want to make the Ultimate Food App available to anyone using Microsoft's new mobile operating system.  To this end, we plan to develop for Windows Phone with $85,000 in backing.
Stretch Goal #4: Food Bank Connect
While the United States is the wealthiest country on earth, it is deplorable to see that USDA statistics show a 14.6% increase in “food insecurity” nationwide from 2008-2010.  The increase is nearly 20% in some Southern states.  (USDA. Coleman-Jensen, A., Nord, M., Andrews, M., & Carlson, S. Household Food Security in the United States in 2010)  
In our community and throughout much of the nation, food bank officials will tell you that they are seeing more middle class families turning to charitable outlets to find basic sustenance.
We believe that not only is it our civic duty to address this issue, but also that we could not in good conscience call it The Ultimate Food App if we could not find a way to use this technology to help you feed the hungry in your community.  We propose to create a capability within The Ultimate Food App that allows users and restaurant owners alike connect to food banks nearby.  Whether you run a licensed commercial kitchen or have extra groceries at home, you will be able to inform one or more food banks that you have surplus food and make arrangements to get the food to where it’s needed most.
We will not charge any user, restaurant, or food bank to use this system.
At a funding level of $105,000, we plan to develop this vital service.
Stretch Goal #5:  Dietary Edition
Just like the app itself, the inspiration for this capability came from personal experience.  At lunchtime one day, Rene and his companions tried to use an app to find food, only to realize that everyone in the car had dietary considerations.  And none of their mobile apps could search or filter upon factors such as no red meat, low carbs, lactose free, etc.
Since the preliminary design for The Ultimate Food App had already started, it occurred to us that it would be a great idea to come up with an app that could take dietary data and locate dishes that meet the user's requirements. 
Restaurants, regardless of their subscription status with us can submit the dietary profiles for no charge.
We plan development of this capability at $135,000.
 
 
What's in a Name?
With apologies to Mr. Shakespeare and Ms. Juliet, while our app is a great concept to us, naming it is a different story altogether.  Rene thinks it should be called Meal-O-Cator and Rodney thinks it's FoodLync.  Rather than letting them bicker over this, we've decided to leave it up to our backers.  So if you pledge $10 or more to our project, you get to vote on its name.  You'll see them asking anyone they see about this, but the contributors are the ones in the dimly lit room who really call the shots.  And yes, that means you can also vote to keep calling it The Ultimate Food App.  It certainly would save us having to do a lot of new artwork.
 
 
WE LOVE PERKS!
In gratitude for your contirbution, we are offering some very cool perks.
But first a few things to point out...
We are not giving away iPhones. The iPhones in the images below represent the app. Nor are we giving away the plate, silverware, and napkin.  They are just illustrations.  Foodie Swag logo imprints are simulated.  While we will do all we can to portray these items accurately, the actual appearance of items may vary.  Actual appearance of Rene and Rodney certainly will vary.
 
About the Foodie Swag
Yes, we are giving out some really cool Foodie Swag to our contributors.  But we want to emphasize that it's more than branded merchandise.  Anything with the app logo on it is specifically designed to  be useful to Foodies and anyone else who goes out to eat. But more importantly, the Foodie Swag is meant to serve as campaign material for the Movement.  We've given some serious thought to what we're giving out. 
For instance, look at the Ultimate Food App Sticky Notes.  Everyone jots down notes and leaves them stuck in a prominent spot.  It helps them remember important stuff.  But at the same time, you can also give the people that wander into your cubicle a hint about how they can join our Movement and add the food they love for everyone to find.
And the hand sanitizer.  If you go out to eat, there's no need to leave your hard won seat to practice good personal hygiene.  That girl dining alone at the table next to yours will see your bottle and ask about the app.  She'll probably even ask to borrow your phone so she can post her Panini Special on Facebook.  The app truly does bring people together!

Statement of Transparency 

(Let's get serious for a moment...)
There has been a lot of press lately on how tech companies, including some of the most successfully funded projects in crowdfunding history, have either run out of money or are announcing serious delays in the delivery of their product.  We are uncomfortable with this trend, as we see crowdfunding and Indiegogo in particular as an important and necessary alternative means of financing tech projects.  To this end, we are undertaking the development of the Ultimate Food App with the understanding that our success or failure will reflect upon the viability of all other technology and software development projects that are on Indiegogo, whether at this time or in the future.
To substantially increase the probability of success, we plan to apply key principles of project management that our team has utilized in past capacities for software and web development in several industries, in sectors ranging from manufacturing to government, and applications ranging from inventory management to social networking.  Key milestones have been established and controls will be utilized to assure conformity to standards of scheduling and the quality of deliverables.
In addition to strict management of deadlines and development standards, we are addressing the issue of financial sustainability through the application for planning methodologies for close monitoring of budget variances and cash flow projections.  Of course, none of this would be of use if not for our foundation of a comprehensive budget for the project. 
Even outside of Indiegogo, many software developers primarily focus on the design and coding of the product to the neglect of the marketing of what they produce.  Our approach stems from the realization that without a defined market and promotional activity to connect to that market, any for profit venture will inevitably be received with a lukewarm response at best.  Before even the founding of our company, the members of our management team have always taken the approach of identifying a need in a market and creating a product around that need.  And of course, with the primary markets segments for our product identified, our promotional activities can not only be planned but also properly accounted for in our budgeting process.
While these macro-level financial plans are simply overall good business practice, we also have to be cognizant of some key considerations when operating under the specific constraints of an environment such as Indiegogo.  Specifically, with necessity to hit one’s set funding goal, the primary issue encountered is the establishment of a realistic and sound target.  Our project budget has been created for the development of the minimum functionality required to create a product with the right features to address the market needs at hand.  And so our goal becomes that much more attainable. 
But we also understand that to settle for minimum functionality is to compromise the need to strive for excellence.  And so we have defined a series of additional features and capabilities that we feel are logical steps in the continued advancement of our product.  Fortunately, Indiegogo and the world of crowdfunding have given rise to the concept of the stretch goals.  We have seen numerous projects successfully implement the idea of setting a series of progressive goals, to be implemented as additional funds are pledged by their funders. 
Our goals reflect this approach.  The initial funding target is specifically for the development of an app for Apple’s pervasive iOS platform.  The scope of the project reflects the minimal, yet very useful features of the iOS application.  And the scope has been locked in order to develop the product within the funding goal. 
Past the initial goal, stretch goals have been established, most notably the first such goal involving development of an Android version of the app.  It has always been our intention to include users of devices in this fast growing market.  Which incidentally, includes many of our team members.
So in summary, while our Indiegogo project will last just over a month in duration, it is the culmination of a planning process which has taken the better part of a year.  The project itself is only part of a larger entity that includes our marketing plan and ongoing development well beyond the stretch goals of the project.  While predicting the future in detail is in the realm of science fiction, we feel that we have developed plans and controls that will allow us to execute the development and marketing of what we see as an incredibly viable product. 
But what reaches far beyond our business and the app itself is the fact that the true key to success is not our software, but how its use can affect the lives of people throughout the world.  The interaction between the users and the restaurants and food vendors is what drives this.  We sincerely believe that what we are helping to create is a movement and a culture of sharing and helping and improving how people dine out worldwide.  This truly is what makes our app unique and different from all the other apps currently on the market.
And so the success of our app and the database of food is in the end dependent upon how well our funders, and subsequently our users understand its potential and use it.  Fortunately, this is an area that is completely under the control of the community of funders on Indiegogo.
Thanks
The Ultimate Food App Team

By blending fashion-forward hues with ergonomic round forms, we created refined accessories that draw envious eyes and jealous fingers.  By combining unique aesthetics and innovative technology, the IZO keyboard set will not only improve your productivity but also make a style statement for your workspace.  Tired of dull-colored keyboards? By blending an alluring metallic and matte paint, we created three fresh perspectives on pearlescent body finishes.    For ultimate visuals, we displayed different colors from the body down to inside the keycaps. Each metallic-matte body is complemented with contrasting lighter shades in the outer keycaps. Inside each keycap, the double-shot PBT displays a darker-colored font with the backlight off. With the backlight on, a lighter-toned color shines through - giving you a total of 4 different color visuals all in one keyboard.    95% of keyboards are designed with rigid and sharp edges. The IZO design approach defies those expectations. Every corner, line, and edge follows a unified curved form, and numerous design elements were fused for ergonomic comfort and refined beauty. Our unique edge-less design is built to be visually soothing and soft to the touch.       The intuitive gold control knob is both gorgeous and functional - helping you efficiently access important media & backlight functions with ease. By simply turning the knob, you can increase or decrease volume and push down for mute. When holding 'FN' while turning the knob, you can increase or decrease the backlight brightness, and push down to cycle between 21 backlight modes.   With 21 backlight modes to choose from, you can pick from a variety of different light settings for the perfect visual experience.    Our custom PBT double-shot keycaps create a light and dark color contrast between the keycap and font - displaying two-color effects with the backlight on and off. By adding laser-etched font, the keys will never fade away with time and usage.    Popular for typing and programming, Gateron Blue mechanical switches are clicky with responsive haptic feedback. With an average of 50 Million actuations, expect a long lifespan with these reliable mechanical switches.    A switch on the back of the keyboard allows you to easily choose between USB or Bluetooth connectivity.    In USB mode, simply connect the included Type-C cable for a wired connection. In Bluetooth mode,  easily pair the device with your computer with a strong Bluetooth 5.0 connection and switch between up to 3 Bluetooth devices.   For ultimate versatility, the IZO keyboard is fully compatible with Mac and PC operating systems. IZO keyboards come with hybrid Operating System keycaps which display both OS icons. This allows users to use either PC or Mac without swapping out keycaps.   The large 5,000 mAh Lithium-ion rechargeable battery can be used for up to several months on a single charge with the backlight off (depending on usage).        The IZO number pad functions as a standalone calculator when not used as a number pad, giving you two-in-one. Calculator function keys were built specifically for all calculator necessities. By toggling the switch on the top, users can connect to any device in Bluetooth or USB Mode to use as a number pad.     Inspired by the luxurious feel and look of cosmetic bottles, the IZO mouse combines metallic matte, elegant gold, and milky frost to create a glamorous juxtaposition of colors.   The alluring gold scroll wheel and ring highlight the soft touch of the translucent frost body, showcasing multiple textures within the design. Through extensive testing and redesigns, we crafted a curved and round form that perfectly fits in your palms.   With two wireless options, the IZO Mouse can connect wirelessly with the backward compatible Bluetooth 5.0 or with the included RF USB Dongle for devices without Bluetooth capabilities.   The highly accurate PixArt PAW 3212 optical sensor comes with adjustable DPI settings at 1000, 1600, or 2400 dpi for reliable tracking.    Retaining the same design principles of the IZO keyboard, the IZO palm rest incorporates a parallel round pattern, while the colorful print on its microfiber surface perfectly matches the hue of your keyboard. Made with memory foam, the IZO Palm Rest's ergonomic design provides good elasticity and soft comfort for long-term use.    Similar to the IZO Palm Rest, the IZO Desk Pad incorporates the same pattern and microfiber surface that perfectly matches your keyboard and mouse.             Founded in Los Angeles in 2005, AZIO was created as the answer to stagnant aesthetics of workspace accessories.

<p>Since <a href=""http://studiosoapp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Studioso</a> was founded in March of 2017, we have focused on creating a product that centers on improving lives of music students and teachers. Our primary objective is to optimize music education through improving efficiency. The app is focused around making sure all aspects of music education are productive, efficient, and organized. As we revolutionize music education to be more effective and enjoyable, our mission has grown to transcend the mere improvement of music education. Studioso is a leader in expanding the accessibility of quality music education. We have pledged to donate part of our profits to provide scholarships for underprivileged music students. Every student deserves access to music education, and we are determined to be the leader in corporate support for the arts. This charitable giving is setting a positive example for other corporations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are in need of funding to finish the development of Studioso on all web, iOS, and Android platforms and to accelerate our growth through marketing investment. Specifically, the team will contract additional app and web developers to complete Studioso’s full launch by 2018. In marketing, we will attend music education conferences to directly introduce our product to music educators.</p>
<p>If we do not meet our goal, the funds will be used mainly for marketing purposes and we will maintain our in-house app development with a slower pace and longer time before our release date.</p>
<p>At Studioso, our mission is to improve the lives of music students and teachers. We believe the best way to do this is through technology. That is why Studioso LLC was founded in March of 2017. With a growing team of 7 musicians, marketers, and app developers, Studioso is creating an app to connect music students to their teachers in a way that enhances the learning experience and facilitates the lives of teachers. Through enabling clear communication, efficient practice, and progress visualization, Studioso is eliminating student frustration, encouraging motivation, and fostering students’ love of music. However, Studioso is more than just an app. We are a company with a higher purpose of expanding the accessibility of music education.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Goals</h3><p>The goal of this campaign is to fund creation of a new Static Code Analyzer for JavaScript, which will be available as PhpStorm, WebStorm and Idea Ultimate plugin. Project code name is ""JS Inspections (EA Extended)"" and we are targeting <a href=""https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7622-php-inspections-ea-extended-/reviews"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this level of community satisfaction</a>.</p><p> </p><p>Comparing to already existing alternatives (eslint, tslint), the analyzer will be capable of:</p><ul>
<li>analyzing both JavaScript and TypeScript</li>
<li>giving instant feedback while you are writing code (without any external tools)</li>
<li>assisting in learning new language features and following best practices</li>
<li>deeply analyzing control flow and data types</li>
<li>providing tooling for efficiently working with legacy code (fully customizable rules and more)</li>
<li>bringing security, performance, control flow and probable bugs rules</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>When it comes to JetBrains IDEs, the plugin will push the Static Code Analysis quality bar further in direction of finding security, performance issues, potential bugs and much more.</p><h3>Benefits (+ click on a perk to see rewards)</h3><p>The main benefit is having state of art and simple to use code analyzer for JavaScript, running real-time in your JetBrains IDE and helping you to avoid bugs and to automate code fixes. Only backers will get exclusive access to the plugin, before anyone else does.

Project code name is ""JS Inspections (EA Extended)"" and we are targeting this level of community satisfaction. Comparing to already existing alternatives (eslint, tslint), the analyzer will be capable of:
analyzing both JavaScript and TypeScript
giving instant feedback while you are writing code (without any external tools)
assisting in learning new language features and following best practices
deeply analyzing control flow and data types
providing tooling for efficiently working with legacy code (fully customizable rules and more)
bringing security, performance, control flow and probable bugs rules
 When it comes to JetBrains IDEs, the plugin will push the Static Code Analysis quality bar further in direction of finding security, performance issues, potential bugs and much more.Benefits (+ click on a perk to see rewards)The main benefit is having state of art and simple to use code analyzer for JavaScript, running real-time in your JetBrains IDE and helping you to avoid bugs and to automate code fixes. Only backers will get exclusive access to the plugin, before anyone else does. Of course with higher pledge, more perks are available (incl. custom rules creation).Team backgroundSince 2014 we created similar analyzers for PHP (Php Inspections (EA Extended), Php Inspections (EA Ultimate) and Yii2 Inspections) providing real-time code analysis and making life of ~30 000 engineers easier every day.The analyzers are covering wide scope of possible defects: from code style to security issues.

<h2><strong>Breakthrough technology</strong></h2>
<p><strong>XeroPass </strong>is the first secure identity authentication solution of its kind that allows you to approve computer access to all your online accounts from your smartphone, and eliminates the need to create, remember, enter or update user names and passwords. <strong>XeroPass </strong>gives you real-time control over all your accounts. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>This is just the beginning... </strong></h2>
<p><strong>XeroPass </strong>is not a simple password manager or storage device that can be lost or hacked, but a triplex next-generation cyber-security solution that gives you total control over all your online accounts and related purchases and expenses.  More importantly, <strong>XeroPass </strong>on Indiegogo is your first step into next-generation cyber-security that will ultimately eliminate the need to use passwords and logins altogether.  In the future, you’ll simply click on the <strong>XeroPass</strong> icon on participating websites and be logged into your accounts while retaining complete control over your personal information and purchases using those accounts.</p>
<p>As leading cyber-security experts, we recognize that user names and passwords simply don’t provide true-security and that all of us are being forced to spend more and more time dealing with this problem.  We also know that discrete devices and password mangers are easily compromised by today’s industrial hackers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The future of XeroPass includes you!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>XeroPass</strong> is an extensible solution to the problem of secure authentication that has plagued some of the top online companies with greater frequency.  The password files of these companies are under constant attack, requiring more complex and difficult to remember passwords.  The days of using passwords as a method of securing your personal accounts and information are numbered. </p>
<p>As a <strong>XeroPass</strong> contributor you will help decide what features will be added to <strong>XeroPass</strong> first. We're already planning to put real-time financial transaction approval in the palm of your hand.  The potential applications for <strong>XeroPass</strong> are unlimited, and we want your invaluable, creative ideas.</p>
<p>    </p>
<h2><strong>Why did we create XeroPass?</strong></h2>
<p>We’re a purpose driven company of people, committed to changing the status-quo for the better, so we can all live happier and more productive lives.  We were already engaged in successfully solving complex cyber-security challenges for business and government. We are inventing next-generation cyber-security technology to make computers immune to cyber-borne threats.</p>
<p>At certain levels of participation you’ll have the opportunity to view video interviews where top experts in cyber security talk about our technology and how it is changing the game in the quest for true-security in cyber space.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>About XeroPass</strong></h2>
<p>With <strong>XeroPass</strong>, every time you navigate to a website on your computer, your smartphone pops-up a message that asks if you want to approve a login for that website.  Select <strong>YES</strong> and you are automatically logged into the account for that website.  No more creating, remembering, resetting, entering or re-entering login information.</p>
<p><strong>XeroPass</strong> also allows you to automatically and easily generate unique logins and passwords that meet the high security standards being required more frequently by banks and e-commerce websites.</p>
<p>If your smartphone is lost or stolen, it can’t be accessed by others and it’s fast and easy to deactivate that smartphone and activate a new one.</p>
<p><strong>Unparalleled protection and ease of use </strong>– When you navigate to a website you are automatically logged in.  When you set up a new account you can use <strong>XeroPass</strong> to generate your login information.</p>
<p><strong>XeroPass </strong>employs a triplex cyber-security schema based on patented technologies that government security and academic experts have dubbed <em>“game changing”</em>. The data required for accessing any specific account is never stored on your computer or in the same place, at the same time or in any form that can be viewed by others.</p>

<p><strong>Is the information stored in the cloud encrypted?</strong></p>
<p>Yes - In addition, the account information stored in the cloud is not in a form that is usable.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How we manage the challange</strong></h2>
<p>Because the prototype for XeroPass is already completed, the primary challange in a project involving proprietary technology and several third-party delivery components (app stores and smartphones) is the risk of an extended schedule.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the main technology components of Xeropass are designed by Vir2us and are well understood by our engineers and product marketing professionals, and the third-party app store submission criteria and implementation schedules are well defined.</p>

Our festival is one of the most cost effected ways to get an app noticed.
 

~ What Can You Do? ~
We need to let app developers know about how we can help their app get noticed. 
PLEASE HELP US GET THE WORD OUT!
You can use the Indiegogo Share Tools to do this.
Please send a link of this page to all your app developer friends and let them know how we are building an interactive festival of apps that can get their apps into the hands of app aficionados across the country.
If you have a favorite app, fund it, then send us an email and we will contact the app developer to request permission to create an exhibit for it and add it to our tour. We have already gotten permission from a number of awesome apps to create an exhibit for them.
 
If you are an app developer who wants their app to be a part of our tour, fund the app and then send us an email with your graphics and/or video and we will begin constructing your exhibit and add it to our festival.

<h1>Why SmartNewspapers</h1>
<p>At Audiovisual News, Inc. we know that your time is valuable and so is being in the know. Consequently, we plan to create a new kind of newspaper by transforming traditional newspapers into SmartNewspapers that will give you more time to enjoy your newspapers and will make it very easy to always be in the know from sources you trust.</p>
<p>SmartNewspapers are personalized, audiovisual extensions of major newspapers like: The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today and your favorite local newspapers. They read like print newspapers, on almost any Internet device with a major Internet browser, and can be heard like an audiobook, using content from voiceover artists instead of synthesized computer voices.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t currently read newspapers and get your news from the Internet, SmartNewspapers might change your mind because SmartNewspapers will make it even easier and faster for you to get your news from the Internet. For example, instead of going to the Internet to get your news, the news will come directly to you, on devices you probably already own, like your smartphone. This means that you can get personalized news updates as they happen, anywhere and anytime and from sources that you trust! In addition, you can now enjoy your SmartNewspaper while driving in your car, exercising or doing something else.</p>
<p>Imagine listening to your personalized SmartNewspaper in the car, pausing, and then continue reading in silence on the train. With SmartNewspapers, you will have the best of all worlds.</p>

<p>I have spent the past year developing an interactive website that deals with buying and/or selling video tutorials. The prototype is up and running! Through my journey in web designing and starting a business, I have found that tutorials have truly aided in my success.</p>
<p>Free video sharing websites offer some good tutorials, but are hard to find or don't even offer them at all. If you are like me, you have sifted through hundreds of poor tutorials to find what you are looking for.</p>
<p>There is not much incentive for users to create quality video tutorials since there is little money to be made through advertising. ARGH! Advertising is another really annoying obstacle of free video tutorials. No ADS!!!</p>

<h1><strong>Paid Tutorials</strong></h1>
<p>That is where I thought paid tutorials would be much better. There are websites that provide paid tutorials, but are limited on the categories that are taught. This occurs because they directly hire the teachers to create tutorials.</p>
<p>Teachinsight is driven by users that submit their tutorials to the community. Anyone can become a teacher. All that is needed is a well-constructed comprehensive tutorial. After submission, the tutorial is reviewed by our team. If the tutorial does not meet our standards an email will be sent to the teacher providing reasons for rejection.</p>
<p>To become a teacher you must pass a basic quiz to confirm you fully understand our process.  Pricing will be kept low ($1-$5) to promote high quantities to be purchased and to compete with free tutorial websites. You can download the tutorial or watch it through our website purchased section. Imagine an incredible Photoshop tutorial that gets purchased by three or four thousand ""students"".</p>

<h1>The Little Monster</h1>
<p>The Cobblebot Little Monster was designed to provide an affordable 
desktop 3D printer capable of high speeds, high resolution, and a very, 
very low cost of ownership.  The printer was dubbed “Little Monster” by 
the Cobblebot team due to its incredibly simplistic design and 
frighteningly awesome performance.  It’s an extremely easy to assemble 
3D printer. A X6"" x Y6"" x Z6"" build area is provided standard, which is 
expandable up to X10"" x Y10"" x Z10"". This campaign is being launched consecutively with an identical Kickstarter Campaign.<br/></p>

<h1>Start Your Journey Into 3D Printing</h1>
<h1></h1>
<p>Whether you are looking to put your creativity to work and bring
 your 
ideas to life or to start a business, Cobblebot Little Monster can help 
you get there. Our high quality and low cost ($199) 3D printer makes 
Cobblebot Little Monster a <i><b>unequaled </b></i>consumer 3D printer that can be used for business or personal use.  </p>
<p>You dream it, let Cobblebot make it!</p>
<h1>Material &amp; Filament</h1>
<p>The
 Cobblebot Little Monster is primarily designed to print in PLA and ABS 
plastic.  For those interested in printing in other materials, the 
hotend may be upgraded to allow printing in other materials, such as: 
Nylon, Polycarbonate, 
Flexible Filament, LayWood, PVA, HDPE. </p>
<h1>Assembly And Calibration</h1>
<p>Cobblebot
 Little Monster can be assembled in 1 
hour and calibrated in minutes.  The Little Monster is an extremely 
simplistic design with few parts which makes assembly a breeze.  You can
 follow our 
detailed written instructions (with pictures) or follow along with our 
video build guide. <br/></p>

<br/>
<div>
<h1>The Final Push</h1>
<h1></h1>
<p>Cobblebot Little Monster is already a completely functional 
consumer 3D 
printer.  But we will be working to improve / perfect its custom parts 
until the end of the Kickstarter campaign. Additionally, we will be 
working to pretty it up a bit.  </p>
<p>All plastic parts will be 
injection molded for smooth and solid parts for everyone. Metal parts 
will be avaliable as an upgrade option.</p>
<h1>What The Future Holds</h1>
<p>Cobblebot
 Inc. is a rapidly expanding business that expects to launch half a 
dozen new machines in 2015, including a CNC Mill, Engraving Machine, 
Laser Cutter, and 3D Scanner.  We also plan to launch a line of filament
 for use with 3D printers.  The current level of success of Cobblebot 
Inc. means our supporters can look forward to continued support of all 
of the products we design and manufacture.  </p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>The hard development work is already done and the team is 100% invested in its completion over the next few months.</p>
<p>So what risks and challenges are there? </p>
<p>We would say that the primary risks/challenges are encountering 
manufacturing delays, delays with logistics, and customs delays. This is
 something that we  encountered with our first Kickstarter / Indiegogo Campaign.
  So what we have done with THIS campaign is we have 
calculated the delays we previously encountered with our manufacturers 
and with customs into the estimated delivery dates for this project.  </p>
<p>Obviously this means if we don't encounter the same delays we 
encountered in our first campaign, everyone could receive their rewards 
months sooner than projected (as early as late April).  But we prefer to
 deliver sooner and have everyone thrilled about getting their Cobblebot
 Little Monster ahead of time than to have to explain why our 
manufactures didn't complete production or ship on time. </p>
<p>The design, manufacturing and importation of products for small 
businesses can be complex.  Most of the Cobblebot Team has experience 
working with large corporations and many of our Team has had experience 
working with some of the very manufacturing companies that we use to 
manufacture Cobblebot parts.  What we have learned the hard way is that 
there is a big difference in the importance that China manufactures 
place on a company that is ordering tens of millions of dollars worth of
 products vs. tens of thousands of dollars worth of products, despite 
any previous relationship with the manufacturer.  As a small business we
 won't be the priority for our manufactures and this can cause delays - 
we believe this is actually the reason for some of our delays in our 
previous Kickstarter / Indiegogo campaign (another delay was that we had quality 
control issues with a manufacturer and they had to reproduce the 
product) - but the end result is the same:  We use reputable 
manufactures who will ultimately deliver the goods we ordered and they 
will be of high quality.  And we will turn around and get those parts to
 you, our wonderful supporters.</p>
<p>With a company like Cobblebot Inc. there is no real risk of not receiving your product, only a risk of delayed shipment.</p>

No programming knowledge is needed, hence all of users will enjoy the fun of creating something by themselves.Our design concept comes from hexagonal structure of honeycomb, achieving unlimited expansion in the plane. As for connection interface, use a unique one – input and three -output design, to ensure the uniqueness and  transmission of signal . (Note: some functional modules are designed for ""one- in- one -out"" or ""three- in- three- out "". Please refer to the actual module)Hexagon design / Unlimited extensionEach HoneyComb module is manufactured to an exacting degree of precision. When two modules are connected they will fit in steadily, yet will be easily disassembled. The machines that manufacture Basic & Queen bricks have tolerances as small as 10 micrometres.We’re always happy to explore tools, toys, kits, books, and materials that help educators and parents from around the world to deliver quality STEAM/STEM education.

<p>Have you ever gone to the doctor and pharmacy and have someone ask you later, “What did they say?” and you honestly don’t know? Or you are taking more than one medication and can't remember when to take it and in what dosage?  Don't worry, you're not alone.  Many people have the same problem. As a result, they take their medications incorrectly, which potentially can have some severe side effects. </p>
<p>This is especially true for people with chronic conditions, such as diabetes; they may take 3 to 5 medications at different times during the day, with various dosages, some before or after meals or before bedtime. It can be confusing to keep everything straight.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Solution:</span></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Our Mobile App for Diabetes, iRetainRx</strong>, will simplify the unwieldy task of medication management into a fun and easy interactive mobile experience in the daily lives of those diagnosed with diabetes.  Our advanced and innovative project launch combines high technology with the best of medical science to help people manage their medications.</p>

It will have an interactive component: users will receive ""points"" as positive incentives for taking their blood glucose sugar levels and taking their medication regularly.  They will alert them about medication incompatibility and give reminders for medication refills.  It will help monitor and enable patients, caregivers, and pharmacists to collaborate and successfully implement treatment action plans.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Our Goal:  $30,000: </strong></span></p>
<p>For our first software product offering, the <strong>Mobile App for Diabetes, iRetainRx</strong>, we are raising <strong>$30,000</strong> to allow us to deploy and launch our mobile app on Android devices to support people with Diabetes. This money will pay for 1000 hours worth of design, development, testing and deployment.</p>
<p>We already have the back end built, but we need help funding with the front end. We are using the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology smart stickers; you might have heard of them used for Google Wallet or other payment transactions. We are going to use this NFC technology to remind, track, motivate and reward people for their actions necessary for treating diabetes. Currently, there is no mobile health application with NFC smart stickers used in this way.  <strong>The end result of this phase will be a standalone mobile software product with NFC interactivity.</strong> </p>

Just imagine what it’s like to be working full time and managing a full time chronic illness. It often debilitates patients and causes them to limit their daily activities.  However, if they can control their chronic condition successfully, they can lead fuller lives.” David feels that with his clinical medical background and his entrepreneurial business experience, he can help others manage their condition with this mobile healthcare medication application for diabetes.</p>

<p><strong>IN SHORT</strong></p>
<p>My name is Ron Hatton, and I am a garage-level tinkerer. Just a tinkerer like many others, but one who has actually made a discovery that could literally change the planet.</p>
<p>I've dedicated the last 30 or so years of my life to finding something to release the all the power in a gasoline engine. I've seen some pretty cool things happen on my workbench, just like many thousands of people around the world. The difference with me is I actually found something. Something that is truly difficult to believe.</p>
<p>In March of 2009, while working in my garage in Gilbert, Arizona, I was given an insight, an inspiration if you will, of an adjustment that could be made to an engine that would cause something good to happen. And happen it did.</p>
<p>When I applied this adjustment, it took mere seconds to know something amazing was happening to this engine. It was running cooler and quieter and the emissions of the vehicle almost disappeared. When we took it out for a road trip, this Land Rover went from around 200 miles a tank to more than 600, and was more powerful than it had ever been in its life.</p>
<p>This was able to happen because The Gadgetman Groove gives the fuel that is normally wasted in the exhaust what it needs to burn inside the engine.</p>
<p>Since that first application, I have applied this technology to more than 1500 engines with very consistent results. EVERY engine that receives this modification runs better. So, many people have come to me to share this knowledge so they may apply it in their neighborhoods. About 200 people in North America alone are using this technology to make their planet a cleaner place, while benefiting in saving fuel.</p>
<p>I have also been approached by many groups intent on buying out my patent. None wanted to see it delivered, and that was a keystone to my dream of more than 25 years. My goal is to see it made available in a way that makes sense to everyone who wants to learn it, and give them the opportunity to help us change the planet.</p>
<p>You see, as I actually perfected the “The Gadgetman Groove” in my driveway, I bet I can teach you how to do it in yours.</p>
<p>For that, I need your help.</p>
<p>To be able to teach more people, I need better training materials. Materials that are expensive to produce. Instructional videos need to be made that describe, in detail, how to make the most from its application, for it changes many things about the way an engine burns fuel.</p>

<p>According to the EPA, at least 60% of every dollar's worth of energy burns in the exhaust. The Gadgetman Groove can change all that, demonstrated in the fact that about 40% of the vehicles I modify experience doubling of their mileage.</p>
<p>I told you it was going to be difficult to believe. But it is, nonetheless, true. If you want to see for yourself, just go to YouTube.com and search for “Gadgetman Groove”. There, you will find more than 300 video reports on its effects, but not from my perspective. From the mouths of The People who have experienced it.</p>
<p>Your contributions will allow more people to apply this simple adjustment to every gasoline engine on the planet. From chain saws and weed-eaters <em><strong>(2-cycle engines)</strong></em> to the largest V-10 Tritons, they are all designed to consume fuel and The Gadgetman Groove reverses some of that waste.</p>
<p>If we only save 20% of what we spend on gasoline <em><strong>(about $24 million an hour)</strong></em> we would have an extra $100 Million flowing through our economy. And THAT is something we ALL need. Not only that, but our engines would no longer be polluting our air with nearly as much garbage due to inefficient engine design.</p>

Their goals are the same: to find, and deliver new technology to brother and sister citizens of an abused planet.
Some succeed.
Have you ever heard about someone who came up with something amazing? Something that would make the world better for everyone? Where did it go?
What if you were the discoverer? 
I mean, what if, working from the comfort of your garage or workshop, you found something that would eliminate pollution from cars, for example. Not only virtually eliminate pollution, but give you better mileage, and made your car run better than it ever has?
Wouldn't you think the World would beat a path to your door to get hold of your discovery if they only knew about it?
What if they didn't?
What would you do?
I bet you would do pretty much the same as I with my discovery. You would take it to the people, no matter what it took.

To get this technology into the hands of more people, we are going to need some supplies. We need better training materials and more of the special cutting tools to create the shape that allows this all to happen. Then, we need more people to know about The Groove.
To spread it around the world in an accurate manner, we will also see to it being translated into Spanish, French, Russian and German to begin with.

As you can see, the hard costs alone will amount to about $40,000 for English training alone. To translate into additional languages and produce 100 each will cost approximately $6000 per.

Your help and support will further improve my conditions and strengthen my physical, psychological, and emotional health. As a result, I could continue working to the best of my abilities, capacity, and aptitude.THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME BE A STEP CLOSER TO MY GOALS!I believe that kindness is a choice we make everyday: it can be simply a smile or a gesture that acknowledges the other person's existence, the time you give to listen to other people, or your sincerity towards other people. Kindness is BEAUTIFUL. While I sincerely do everything I can to help other people feel appreciated everyday, I still want to help others on a larger scale someday--like what has been done to help me get to where I am. Your help is already making my dream a REALITY: giving back and making a difference to the lives of people through KINDNESS. After settling down and saving up, I want to continue devoting my life to help other people in need through giving them opportunities to study and achieve life goals.THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOUR FUNDING IS IN FOR A LIFETIME!This fundraising project is very important for me because it already empowers me to carry on with my dreams in spite of the challenges I have been facing. Also, this project strengthens my hopes to achieve my highest potentials because it will help me become more physically, mentally, and emotionally prepared for everyday life (especially work). Eventually, I will be more able to help other people in need. :)Thank you very much for taking time to read this. Your time is already an invaluable form of support. Please feel free to contact me for any clarifications and for any way that would help this project be a success. PERKS! SINCERELY JUST FOR YOU!
For any amount or form of support, you will receive a PERSONALIZED THANK YOU card full of gratitude and love
For any amount or form of support, I will update you occasionally on my whereabouts and my progress towards achieving my goals through personalized video messages, letters, or a blog
For any form of help or support, your kindness will be very much appreciated and will be more than helpful to get me through my current journey. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN FOR YOUR HELP!Thank you for spreading the word. Any form of help is highly and sincerely appreciated. The time you spent to read my story already made a great difference. Your kindness is already in for a lifetime. Thank you.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Hi everyone - thanks for stopping by.</h3>
<p>Let me tell you about a project I am very passionate about.</p>
<p>My name is David Webster, and I've spent around 25 years developing interactive training software, interactive encylopedias, writing books, starting my own company, and creating the KnowledgePresenter and KP Learner Manager software products.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, I've been working hard on a product called AppCobra. This software is designed to allow <em>anyone</em> to create mobile and HTML5 apps, without programming.</p>
<p>You may have seen some other 'app creation' tools. But you have probably not seen AppCobra. This is a completely different beast.</p>
<p>AppCobra is <strong>not</strong> a stopgap tool. It is <strong>not</strong> a tool for creating 'soft-of' apps. It allows you to create apps that take advantage of all HTML5 and mobile features. It allows you to create apps that previously could only be done with specific platform software developer kits, and a lot of programming.</p>
<p>And you can create apps for any HTML or mobile platform.</p>
<p>If you want to see some examples, have a look at <a href=""http://www.appcobra.com/uni/examples"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">these demos</a>. Or, have a look at <a href=""http://www.appcobra.com/why.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this document</a>.</p>
<p>You will be amazed at what can be achieved. There is no room to detail all the features here - but stop by <a href=""http://www.appcobra.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.appcobra.com</a> for more detail.</p>
<p><strong>The Next Step</strong></p>
<p>We want to expand AppCobra in two major areas.</p>
<p>First, we want to create a social media based online app site – which we are currently called <strong>The AppCobra Cloud</strong>. This will provide a forum where any AppCobra developer can post their apps - share their apps - distribute their apps, and sell their apps. A place where people can show off their skills. Where students, developers and corporations can reach out to and show the world what they've done, and what they have available.</p>
<p>A place where you can share your app with friends. Or share with the world. Students can show off to their class, and teachers can comment on student apps.</p>
<p>Because AppCobra creates apps for all platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, etc.), and can essentially create device independent apps, this site will not be tied to any particular platform, but optimized for all. A single app can be made available on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>This is a place where users can search for apps via keywords, categories, companies, platform, users, or any one of a range of other criteria.</p>
<p>These users may run, purchase and/or download apps, leave comments, ratings, scores, and more.</p>
<p>Developers will be able to upload apps to their AppCobra Cloud account in one step, directly from AppCobra. And their app can be deployed, or updated, instantly. No waiting for someone to review it. Or reject it.</p>
<p>And we want to make this even better by creating a system whereby people can make money from their apps.</p>
<p>In the education arena, this will particularly useful - teachers can check user homework - in the form of apps - make comments, add and edit scores, and make suggestions.</p>
<p>Like most social media platforms, this platform will include the ability to have friends, associates, classmates, followers, and more.</p>
<p>Developers can use the <strong>AppCobra Cloud</strong> to share or sell code or projects, ask questions, get and give advice, and generally communicate with each other about their apps.</p>
<p>We also recognise that people may want native apps in the various App stores - so, secondly, we would also like to make this a one click process – and a fee would apply for this process.</p>
<p>Currently, within AppCobra, we already have the ability to be able to upload, in a single operation, your app to our server, and invite someone to view it, or download it to your device. It acts as a kind of proof of concept that is already working, and can be tested with a trial download of AppCobra.</p>
<p>Additionally, our experience with KP Learner Manager Enterprise, our Learning Management System, has given us the expertise to allow us to be able to track all online usage and permissions for apps.</p>
<p><strong>AppCobra Online</strong></p>
<p>At the moment, there are a number of tools that allows simple Apps to be created using online tools. These may be simple to use, but essentially create little more than phone or tablet sized websites, with few if any taking true advantage of devices and HTML5. This is due in part to the limitations of online tools – development is slower, and many features found in desktop tools can simply not be used, plus what I perceive as a rush to get to market.</p>
<p>We can and will make a version of AppCobra online.

Let me tell you about a project I am very passionate about.
My name is David Webster, and I've spent around 25 years developing interactive training software, interactive encylopedias, writing books, starting my own company, and creating the KnowledgePresenter and KP Learner Manager software products.
Over the last two years, I've been working hard on a product called AppCobra. This software is designed to allow anyone to create mobile and HTML5 apps, without programming.
You may have seen some other 'app creation' tools. But you have probably not seen AppCobra. This is a completely different beast.
AppCobra is not a stopgap tool. It is not a tool for creating 'soft-of' apps. It allows you to create apps that take advantage of all HTML5 and mobile features. It allows you to create apps that previously could only be done with specific platform software developer kits, and a lot of programming.
And you can create apps for any HTML or mobile platform.
If you want to see some examples, have a look at these demos. Or, have a look at this document.
You will be amazed at what can be achieved. There is no room to detail all the features here - but stop by http://www.appcobra.com for more detail.
The Next Step
We want to expand AppCobra in two major areas.
First, we want to create a social media based online app site – which we are currently called The AppCobra Cloud. This will provide a forum where any AppCobra developer can post their apps - share their apps - distribute their apps, and sell their apps. A place where people can show off their skills. Where students, developers and corporations can reach out to and show the world what they've done, and what they have available.
A place where you can share your app with friends. Or share with the world. Students can show off to their class, and teachers can comment on student apps.
Because AppCobra creates apps for all platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, etc.), and can essentially create device independent apps, this site will not be tied to any particular platform, but optimized for all. A single app can be made available on multiple platforms.
This is a place where users can search for apps via keywords, categories, companies, platform, users, or any one of a range of other criteria.
These users may run, purchase and/or download apps, leave comments, ratings, scores, and more.
Developers will be able to upload apps to their AppCobra Cloud account in one step, directly from AppCobra. And their app can be deployed, or updated, instantly. No waiting for someone to review it. Or reject it.
And we want to make this even better by creating a system whereby people can make money from their apps.
In the education arena, this will particularly useful - teachers can check user homework - in the form of apps - make comments, add and edit scores, and make suggestions.
Like most social media platforms, this platform will include the ability to have friends, associates, classmates, followers, and more.
Developers can use the AppCobra Cloud to share or sell code or projects, ask questions, get and give advice, and generally communicate with each other about their apps.
We also recognise that people may want native apps in the various App stores - so, secondly, we would also like to make this a one click process – and a fee would apply for this process.
Currently, within AppCobra, we already have the ability to be able to upload, in a single operation, your app to our server, and invite someone to view it, or download it to your device. It acts as a kind of proof of concept that is already working, and can be tested with a trial download of AppCobra.
Additionally, our experience with KP Learner Manager Enterprise, our Learning Management System, has given us the expertise to allow us to be able to track all online usage and permissions for apps.
AppCobra Online
At the moment, there are a number of tools that allows simple Apps to be created using online tools. These may be simple to use, but essentially create little more than phone or tablet sized websites, with few if any taking true advantage of devices and HTML5. This is due in part to the limitations of online tools – development is slower, and many features found in desktop tools can simply not be used, plus what I perceive as a rush to get to market.
We can and will make a version of AppCobra online. I have experience in developing the technology (of course, AppCobra itself), and have created several online tools before (KP Learner Manager Enterprise, and KnowledgePresenter Q, our online quiz/survey/poll creator software – as seen at quizzes.knowledgepresenter.com).
Files will be able to be transferred to and from the online, and local versions of AppCobra. No other tools to our knowledge will have such a feature. The online tool will, at least initially, serve the simple side of the market – very template driven, not a lot of customization features, as most of the other tools are like – but of course the ability to take to content offline and really create immersive web apps.
This will also increase our market penetration into tablets themselves, rather than just developing on desktops. So a client can actually create apps on their iPad, or Windows Tablet, or other mobile device.
On past experience, and with the technology we have already created, we expect that this tool can be achieved within six months.
What we Need
Our funding goal is $50,000. This will allow us to hire the staff and dedicate the time to make this ground breaking project a reality. Ideally, of course, the more we raise, the quicker and more thoroughly we can turn this project around.
Why Help Us?
We think it is important to democratize the App industry. It is dominated by a few large players - and currently, for many people, especially in education, is just too difficult to bother creating their apps. We want to change this.
It is a glib statement - this could change the world. But I believe this could have a major impact. And with your help, we can do this.
We most certainly have the potential to allow students everywhere to participate in app building and distribution.
I, and Kookaburra Studios, have been around for 13 years now. We have a successful track record in creating the best products in their area.
We are a very small company, but we've already proved that we can create products that are better than those produced by anyone, anywhere.
We'd really appreciate your help.

We estimate our average user will see $132 in interest savings per year.<br/>3. <b>The bigger goal </b>is to enable everyone to be smarter with their finances and force the banks to care more about people than profit, and prove that there’s a better way to do things than just accept the status quo. We also call this the Fingers Up Movement. </p><p>And we believe all of this is possible – with a single app and, of course, a whole lot of people. </p><p>Keep reading for the juicy details. </p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/144/723/ec9245f33ba24f82269cd685b92e667a_original.jpg?w=456&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462824973&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=6fcfbd8b9311525275b73f137c6e1a82"" src=""""/> </figure><p></p><p>The Hip Money team is building an app that we believe will become <i>the</i> go-to financial app for pretty much everyone who uses money. This app will help you pay back loans faster, reach your savings goals more wisely and efficiently, and ultimately save you thousands of dollars. Best part is, the Hip Money app watches your spending habits and creates realistic daily savings suggestions that are appropriate for you. So even if you think you don’t have the funds to save, you do.</p><p>Here's a little glimpse into the app and what it can do: </p><p><br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F151412734&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F151412734&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F551158672_640.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><div>

</figure><p>But exactly how does the Hip Money app work? Easy. Just do this:</p><p><b>Get Hip.</b> <br/>Install Hip Money directly to your iOS or android phone, then securely link it  to your checking, savings, banking, credit and/or loan accounts so Hip Money can understand your spending habits.</p><p><b>Set some goals, playa.</b> <br/>Establish why you’re saving and/or what you’re paying off – maybe you want to pay back a student loan quicker, or save for a down payment on a house, or go on a trip to Cabo or Provo, Utah. Doesn’t matter. All goals are good goals. </p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/144/731/36283ad9973a416810f92ecff9f33662_original.jpg?w=456&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462825004&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=eeaac23df45ac045616ca718b9e89887"" src=""""/> </figure><p></p><p><b>Show yourself the money. </b><br/>Ping! Hip Money pings you once a day (or less if you like) to provide you a personalized daily savings recommendation. Based on your money coming in and going out, Hip Money will tell you what you could/should save that day. All you have to do is determine if that amount is low, high or just right. Then choose where you want to put your daily savings to work. (Notice how you can also see the added savings calculation or potential interest savings projection for each goal?) </p><p><b>Swipe it like it’s hot. </b><br/>Now comes our favorite part. And this is very important. This is where you hold all the power.

We created the Fingers Up Movement because the problem is bigger than you think. </b></p><p>Banks have a system in place that has worked for them for centuries. It makes them lots of money, but it’s at the expense of the customer. </p><p>For years, we watched friends and family members waste money on interest when we knew they could pay off loans faster and more efficiently. And that was frustrating. So we came up with the Hip Money app. (You may have heard of it.)</p><p>To say the least, we were pretty excited about the idea of helping people, so we reached out to banks and lenders to help us take this app directly to their customers. ... Long story short: they weren't interested. To paraphrase: ""helping people be smarter about saving or prepaying loans would impact our bottom line."" </p><p>Whelp, that fueled our fire. We knew then and there that things needed to change. The financial system's mindset needed to shift from short-term profit to long-term customer benefits. And fast. </p><p>So, that led us to the Fingers Up Movement. </p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/144/766/d2efc28bd3c355f725391b676c77785a_original.png?w=456&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462825139&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=dffd72d6398e4dec6b30497e4be86ea7"" src=""""/> </figure><p></p><p><b>Our goal now was to create a movement of people that forces our country’s banks and financial systems to rethink the way they do business - a movement that would force change with a single app and a million FU fingers.</b></p><p>What we’re asking of you is to not only help us get the Hip Money app out into the world, but also share this bigger message. Get others to join the movement. Change the system. Take back control. The more people, the better. </p><p>It’s powerful to think that, with a simple swipe of a finger, you can make a huge impact on your immediate and long-term future. But think about this: what would happen if everyone starting swiping to the right? When a million people do something, there’s no way it can go unnoticed. A gust of wind can create a ripple, but a windstorm can create some serious waves. And we want to create some serious waves.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/011/144/774/4ea3f9bcd1abb6c4d645609e21a42281_original.jpg?w=456&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1462825162&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=90ed9faadbc68323ea1e9fe7ff6dcf5e"" src=""""/> </figure><p></p><p>Well, first and foremost, using the Hip Money app could help you save thousands of dollars.

We want to help people.</p><p>Before there was Hip Money, there were dozens and dozens of interviews with people ages 22-36 about how they currently use money. They shared with us pitfalls in today’s current banking system, gaps in existing technology, good and bad stories about money, and on and on. It was basically 60% customer problem discovery and 40% therapy session (as people don’t often get the chance to talk about what scares them about money, or what they want to see happen with their financial futures). From there, we looked for common themes and one truism rang out: </p><p>""How can I get a better financial future without a lot of time, information, or having to sacrifice the things I like to do like go out with my friends?""</p><p>So that was where the core goal of Hip Money was born. From there, the Hip Money team really got the ball rolling.

We estimate our average user will see $132 in interest savings per year.3. The bigger goal is to enable everyone to be smarter with their finances and force the banks to care more about people than profit, and prove that there’s a better way to do things than just accept the status quo. We also call this the Fingers Up Movement. And we believe all of this is possible – with a single app and, of course, a whole lot of people. Keep reading for the juicy details.  The Hip Money team is building an app that we believe will become the go-to financial app for pretty much everyone who uses money. This app will help you pay back loans faster, reach your savings goals more wisely and efficiently, and ultimately save you thousands of dollars. Best part is, the Hip Money app watches your spending habits and creates realistic daily savings suggestions that are appropriate for you. So even if you think you don’t have the funds to save, you do.Here's a little glimpse into the app and what it can do: 

Make your video accessible in other languages and to deaf and hard-of-hearing backers.

But exactly how does the Hip Money app work? Easy. Just do this:Get Hip. Install Hip Money directly to your iOS or android phone, then securely link it  to your checking, savings, banking, credit and/or loan accounts so Hip Money can understand your spending habits.Set some goals, playa. Establish why you’re saving and/or what you’re paying off – maybe you want to pay back a student loan quicker, or save for a down payment on a house, or go on a trip to Cabo or Provo, Utah. Doesn’t matter. All goals are good goals.  Show yourself the money. Ping! Hip Money pings you once a day (or less if you like) to provide you a personalized daily savings recommendation. Based on your money coming in and going out, Hip Money will tell you what you could/should save that day. All you have to do is determine if that amount is low, high or just right. Then choose where you want to put your daily savings to work. (Notice how you can also see the added savings calculation or potential interest savings projection for each goal?) Swipe it like it’s hot. Now comes our favorite part. And this is very important. This is where you hold all the power. When you’re ready to make that move to save for your future, all you have to do is raise your finger with pride, touch it to the screen, and simply swipe to the right to save.   It's that easy. With a single finger, you can save yourself thousands of dollars over time. ... Did you just get chills? Cause we just got chills.Feel like the balla you are. In less than two minutes a day, with a simple swipe to the right, you have just changed your financial future for the better, forever. Which means you get to feel good about yourself every day. And who doesn’t like that? If you're still not sure how Hip Money works, or if you just really hate reading copy, here's a demo of the app. Narrated by Hip Money's very own Mark Zmarzly.

 Here's the best way we can put this: We created the Hip Money app because we were inspired to help people save and pay back loans smarter. We created the Fingers Up Movement because the problem is bigger than you think. Banks have a system in place that has worked for them for centuries. It makes them lots of money, but it’s at the expense of the customer. For years, we watched friends and family members waste money on interest when we knew they could pay off loans faster and more efficiently. And that was frustrating. So we came up with the Hip Money app. (You may have heard of it.)To say the least, we were pretty excited about the idea of helping people, so we reached out to banks and lenders to help us take this app directly to their customers. ... Long story short: they weren't interested. To paraphrase: ""helping people be smarter about saving or prepaying loans would impact our bottom line."" Whelp, that fueled our fire. We knew then and there that things needed to change. The financial system's mindset needed to shift from short-term profit to long-term customer benefits. And fast. So, that led us to the Fingers Up Movement.  Our goal now was to create a movement of people that forces our country’s banks and financial systems to rethink the way they do business - a movement that would force change with a single app and a million FU fingers.What we’re asking of you is to not only help us get the Hip Money app out into the world, but also share this bigger message. Get others to join the movement. Change the system. Take back control. The more people, the better. It’s powerful to think that, with a simple swipe of a finger, you can make a huge impact on your immediate and long-term future. But think about this: what would happen if everyone starting swiping to the right? When a million people do something, there’s no way it can go unnoticed. A gust of wind can create a ripple, but a windstorm can create some serious waves. And we want to create some serious waves. Well, first and foremost, using the Hip Money app could help you save thousands of dollars. (Did we mention that? Pretty sure we mentioned that.) But more immediately, your contributions can earn you some pretty cool stuff, including helping us in the beta testing, getting access to the app before anyone else, and becoming the proud new owner of a shirt some people are calling the new Pablo Picasso: More of a drinker instead of a shirt wearer? Then we got you covered, too, with 16oz Glass T-Rex Cans or Hip Mugs: Plus, you’ll be part of the Fingers Up Movement, which will (hopefully) continue to grow. And that means you can say you were instrumental in making a difference regarding this very important, and often overlooked problem in our society. We’re kind of at a unique point in the fundraising process, as we’ve already begun building the app and have demoed it across the country, funding it all ourselves.  In fact, we’ve even won some awards:
Runner Up - Chase Bank Sponsored FinCon Startup Challenge 
Top 3 Most Promising Startups - Startup Voodoo 
Winner - Pipeline Pitch of the Year 2016 
Prototype Grant Award - Department of Economic Development 
Top 6 Global Finalist - Sony FinTech Innovation Challenge 
So we know that people want the app; they see what it can really do. And that’s awesome for us. But we have more to do, and we need your help.We said early on that one of our campaign goals is to work directly with you – our earliest users – to build a kickass app that will help get you where you want to go financially, as well as make you happy. By reaching out to the crowdfunding community, we hope to find a core group of our ideal users who have a collaborative spirit and who will give us direct feedback to improve the app as it grows. On top of that ... Raising our $15,000 goal will help us offset some of the initial integration and ongoing costs to move money from your checking account to your savings or loan. Yeah, that costs money. Go figure. Now, we could just launch the app and pass the transfer costs on to the user, but that’s not really our style. So we’d rather get a core group of users to join the campaign, so we can work toward integrating with the payments partner that makes the most sense and has the lowest long-term costs for our users. Last, but most certainly not least: why the hell are we doing all of this? It’s pretty plain and simple. We want to help people.Before there was Hip Money, there were dozens and dozens of interviews with people ages 22-36 about how they currently use money. They shared with us pitfalls in today’s current banking system, gaps in existing technology, good and bad stories about money, and on and on. It was basically 60% customer problem discovery and 40% therapy session (as people don’t often get the chance to talk about what scares them about money, or what they want to see happen with their financial futures). From there, we looked for common themes and one truism rang out: ""How can I get a better financial future without a lot of time, information, or having to sacrifice the things I like to do like go out with my friends?""So that was where the core goal of Hip Money was born. From there, the Hip Money team really got the ball rolling. We set out to create an app that we believe will help make people’s futures better, without disrupting their present-day routines. A lot of people make up our team, but here's the core group. Mark Zmarzly, CEOThis is Mark. He has worked in banking for more than 10 years now. He's pretty much a financial wizard. Ed McKee, CTOThis is Ed. He’s got more than 20 years of technology experience under his belt. And he likes headphones. Obviously. Jude Zmarzly, The FutureThis is Jude. He's Mark’s oldest son. Dressed up as Mark. He’s currently an online-video sensation. There you have it. Our app, our movement, our motivation and our goals. And now we need your finger to make it all happen. (Yes, we know how that sounds.) So please support our campaign and please share it with your friends, family, neighbors, acquaintances, enemies, doctors, mailman (or woman), whoever.

The Impact of our Technology Majority of the time, people transfer money to families and friends because there is an immediate need to cater to domestic bills and survival.

<h1><b>What is the Innovation Deck?</b></h1>
<p>Innovation Deck is a <b>new deck of brainstorming cards for product creators and entrepreneurs</b>. It provides <b>an effective “brain hack”</b> that helps rapidly re-focus on the customer, identify product improvement opportunities and generate ideas.</p>
<p>The Innovation Deck is strategically designed to<b> improve your critical and creative thinking </b>and help you <b>focus on the most crucial product features</b>. As a result, you will be creating <b>better products in shorter time.</b>You’ll get: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>4 Instructional Cards</b></li>
<li><b>23 «EXAMINE» cards</b></li>
<li><b>23 «EXPLORE» cards</b></li>
<li><b>4 «EVALUATE» cards</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Each proven technique and question is uniquely formulated to trigger a wealth of responses from your subconscious mind, allowing you to shed light on hidden areas for product improvement (a.k.a. problems).<br/></p>
<p><br/></p></span><p><span style=""line-height: 40px;letter-spacing: 1px;font-size: 36px;font-weight: bold;"">New innovations begin with the CARDS…</span><br/></p>
<p>Whenever you are looking to create new invention, developing new solution, or just planning to improve the existing product:<i><br/></i></p><h2>
<b>Use the Innovation Deck to create a breakthrough in just 3 simple steps</b>.</h2><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>
<h3>Step 1. Take out twenty-three “EXAMINE” cards to examine the problem.<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>When you are looking for better solutions, you probably ask questions like…</p>
<p>“How to invent something that market will appreciate? What new product ideas would the customer like? What features should I add to my product? What features should I remove?”</p>
<p>“EXAMINE” cards
are strategically designed  to <b>Deep Dive into the problem </b>and <b>laser-in on the
most beneficial answers</b> to these vital questions. </p>
<p>Example: 5 random cards (you are getting 23 ""EXAMINE"" cards in the deck).<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/924635/files/20141012133153-Examine2.png?1413145913"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3>What you will be able to do:</h3><p></p>
<ul><li><h4>
<b><span><span></span></span>Quickly and efficiently laser-in on the
most profitable, helpful, and desirable features you should include in your
product </b>
</h4></li></ul><h4>
</h4><ul><li><h4>
<b>Identify crucial improvement
opportunities for your new product</b>
</h4></li></ul><h4>
</h4><h4>
</h4><ul>
<li><h4>
<b>
<span><span></span></span>Run small but effective “mini design
reviews”, making sure that your product development project stays on track at
all times</b>
</h4></li>
</ul><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p><h3>Step 2. Now use twenty-three
“EXPLORE” cards to explore the wide range of options.</h3>
<p><b>As the greats have
all said, “Want a better answer? Ask a better question…”</b></p>
<p>“EXPLORE” cards<span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> give you the
best and latest brainstorming techniques that have been proven to work in the most challenging industries, combined with the always reliable tools from the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving (TRIZ).</span></p>
<p>Example: 5 random cards (you are getting 23 ""EXPLORE"" cards in the deck).</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/924637/files/20141012133233-Explore3.png?1413145953"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3>What you will be able to do:</h3><p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><h4>
<span><span></span></span><b>Quickly generate a wide range of creative
solutions for any difficult technical problem, creating a large pool of
innovative ideas</b>
</h4></li>
<li><h4>
<span><span></span></span><b>Get
unstuck FAST by transforming your “mental state” so it elegantly solves the
most challenging technical problems with ease </b>
</h4></li>
<li><h4>
<span><span></span></span><b>Allow
yourself to take a deep breath and relax, because you’ll realize that you
already possess the most innovative solution — you just need the right questions
to allow those solutions to surface </b>
</h4></li>
<li><h4>
<span><span></span></span><b>Transform dull, painful meetings from
“ZZZzzzzzzz” to FUN!* Use this deck as a game: spread the cards on the table,
face down. Turn over one random card, discuss it with the team and see how
novel ideas come to mind</b>
</h4></li>
</ul><blockquote><p>*Most studies on gamification
found a positive effect from the use of game thinking and game mechanics to
engage users in solving problems.</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p><h3><b>Step 3. Apply four “EVALUATE” cards to evaluate the ideas and pick the most promising one.<br/></b></h3>
<p>You’ve EXAMINED and
ferreted out all the potential problems. </p>
<p>You’ve EXPLORED and
delivered the widest array of saleable solutions. </p>
<p>Now it’s time to
EVALUATE. </p>
<p>So now it's time to answer the crucial question:</p>
<p><b><i>“Which idea should I invest my time, money
and team resources in?”</i></b></p>
<p>“EVALUATE” cards help you to see
a bigger picture. The chosen techniques also help your subconscious mind
naturally review your wide array of solutions, and choose the optimal one. </p>
<p>Example: 2 random cards (you are getting 4 ""EVALUATE"" cards in the deck).<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/873985/files/20140922081119-Evaluate.png?1411398679"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3>What you will be able to do:</h3><p></p>
<ul>
<li><h4>
<span><span></span></span><b>Laser-in to quickly and easily identify
the most optimal, profitable solution, so you save money, energy and
resources — by minimizing unnecessary design
loops and saving TIME </b>
</h4></li>
<li><h4>
<span><span></span></span>Stop in-fighting and power games that result in poor solution choice — because the rules of the game is
clear, and the most innovative and winning idea naturally arises!</h4></li>
</ul><p></p>

And that’s not all: according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, for those products that get through the hurdles of development and manufacturing, and are launched to the market, <b>over 90 percent will fail</b> in the first four years.</p><p>At the same time, there are several products on Kickstarter and IndieGoGo that managed to raise over $1’000’000 in just a couple of months.</p><p>Why is it so difficult to create commercially viable products? And why some products succeed while others fail? <b>I believe our brains are to blame.</b></p><p>Our brains are built up in such a way that we delete most of the information that comes our way. <b>We’re deletion machines.</b> For example, if right now you are focused on reading this page, you are likely to delete most of the information around you. You might not notice how warm your feet may feel, or the noise of the computer fan, until I mention it.</p><p>Similar thing happens when we develop products: once we get a product idea that we believe in, we focus on it. And <b>as we put our idea into the spotlight, we tend to delete everything else.</b></p><p>We are so laser-focused on developing our solution,<b> we ignore the inputs from the market, large part of the alternative solutions, and whether there is a better way to add value</b> to the customer.</p><h3><b>Those who are able to control their focus, create products that sell.</b></h3><p>Unfortunately, controlling our focus is not always easy.</p><p><b>We've all been guilty of jumping right into solution design, rather than seeing whole picture and considering the variety of options.</b></p><p>I grew a bit <i>frustrated</i> seeing us innovators <i>buried in details at the very beginning of the concept stage</i>, where “big picture” thinking and open-mindedness matters more. People going in circles, coming up with very similar solutions and not seeing the way out. Companies that spend months and years (and millions of dollars) developing a new product nobody wants.</p><p>So<b> I sought out a solution</b> — brainstorming cards that help you to re-focus on the customer, quickly identify improvement opportunities and generate a wide variety of solutions when it matters most. <b>Solution that is fast to use and brings instant results.</b></p><p>And the Innovation Desk was born.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/877605/files/20140923150144-Prototype2_-_bluer.png?1411509704"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>

I put the Innovation Deck to work for me?”</h1>
<p>I keep mine on my desk, to provide a quick check-list that guarantees I
understand the problem, can generate the widest array of saleable solutions,
and easily identify the most profitable new product idea.<br/></p>
<p>How you can foresee yourself using it, is up to you…</p>
<p>Whether you’re developing a product alone, stuck in a no-solution
meeting, or working with a team of bull-headed competitors, here’s why you
should always keep The Innovation Deck close at hand.</p>
<p>Here are just a few ways our colleagues benefited from using The
Innovation Deck:</p>
<p><span>•<span> 
</span></span><b>As a Dual-Brained Checklist: </b>Go through the deck methodically, picking
one card after another and spending a minute or two thinking about each
question, allowing you to easily <span>engage both your conscious and subconscious mind to solve your most
challenging problems.</span></p>
<p><span>•<span> 
</span></span><b>As a Split-Second Inspiration Generator: </b>Pick a random card out of the deck. What
does it say? Is it relevant to your product? Why? What could you do to improve
things further? What else?</p>
<p><span>•<span> 
</span></span><b>As a Zap to the Team Brain:</b> Get together with your team. Spread the
cards on the table, face down. Turn over one random card. Discuss how it is
relevant to your product or problem? Why can you use this now? What’s the best
way to apply the questions? See how many ideas you can trigger from a single
card and you’ll instantly begin to see its value. Once the discussion is
finished, the next team member turns over another random card.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p></p>
<h1><b>What the Innovation Deck is NOT…</b></h1>
<p>It’s Not Magical (although it might feel that way when you're generating new ideas on demand).
It’s NOT a Golden Pill. </p>
<p>If you’re an
entrepreneur, engineer, or innovator, you probably already know that to absorb
the full benefits from the Innovation Deck<b> you’ll absolutely need two things:</b></p>
<p><span>A)<span>  </span></span>Attention and a few
minutes of your time to consider the questions on the cards, and<span><br/></span></p><p><span>B)<span>  </span></span>A genuine wish to
make your product better. 

</p><p>And if you let it
just sit on your table, not much will happen. </p>
<h4><i>Like everything worth
doing, creating spell-binding products requires effort — the Innovation Deck
simply eases your most common challenges, eliminates the mental blocks, and
incites answers from your brain.</i></h4><p><br/></p><p></p>
<h1>Quality</h1><p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438251575/oikoocuqas1vvq46ohlq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></span></p><p>As a colleague, I know how much you value the quality of the products you create. That’s why I have searched long and hard to identify the best suppliers on planet Earth.</p>
<p>I have every assurance that no corners will be cut, ever, in the making of any card in your Innovation Deck, including printing it on the finest multi-layered card stock, with a resistant structured surface—so it retains its shape and durability through years of use. The cards will be delivered to your door in a
handy transparent plastic box — to ensure that extra added measure of protection,
and guarantee they will catch your eye, so you remember to take them out and
generate that Next Big Idea, in seconds.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h1>Schedule</h1>
<p></p>
<p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>The printing time is expected to take about two weeks and delivery to your door will take another two weeks. </span><br/></p><p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> If you order a PDF, we will aim to send it to you within one day.</span></p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h1>You’re a Thinker. So you obviously have more questions…</h1>
<h1>Here are your answers.</h1><p><br/></p><p><i><b>This page is too long... Can you explain in three sentences how to invent something new?</b></i></p><p>Sure.<br/></p><p><b>1.</b> Ask questions from ""Examine"" cards to understand your customer, point out critical issues, and limit the area where you are going to search for solutions. <br/></p><p><b>2. </b>Apply techniques from ""Explore"" cards to generate a variety of different ideas that solve issues and customer pain that you discovered in Step 1.</p><p><b>3.</b> Finally, use ""Evaluate"" cards to evaluate all the options you now have, and choose the most optimal solution.</p><p>Congratulations, your new product idea is created!<br/></p>
<p><b><i>Why is the Innovation Deck a better alternative than “brainstorming” cards?</i></b></p>
<p>It is NOT your usual manual with a list of random brainstorming questions. It focuses specifically on product invention process, giving you the
best and latest techniques that have been proven to create new inventions in the most challenging industries. </p>
<p>It also takes into account the way we humans process language and triggers
your unconscious mind to generate solutions for you.</p>
<p><b><i>I’m an Entrepreneur. How can I use the Innovation Deck for non-physical products
(software, services, etc.)?</i></b></p>
<p>As a forward thinking individual you will find many ways to use the
majority of the cards right away, and the remaining cards as your project
develops.<span>  While the Innovation Deck
originally had a physical product focus, many who deal in the abstract have
touted its unbeatable benefits as well.</span></p><p><b><i>Why buy several decks? </i></b></p>
<p>Beyond the fact that you should take advantage of our offer to brand
these, and anchor your business as “The Innovator” in the subconscious minds of
your clients, you should buy several decks for your friends, your office, your
teammates…</p>
<p>I believe, as a product creator, that every product creator should have one. Plus card
decks are like toothbrushes – everybody will want to use his/her own.</p><p><b></b></p>
<p><b><i>How do I
track the amount of referrals I made?</i></b></p>
<p>Remember, you’ll get your choice of $30 from your order OR one FREE
Innovation Deck for every two of your referrals who support us (we’ll
e-mail you to ask your choice after the campaign is finished). Here is how you
track the number of your referrals: </p>1. Sign onto IndieGoGo.<br/>2. Click on your user name beside the Search Box at the top right of the
page.<br/>3. Select “My Profile” option

<p>4. Click on the tab that says “Referrals” for the latest totals of
Referrals and Pledges that resulted from your sharing.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><i>How can I
boost my amount of referrals?</i></b></p>
<p>A few easy ideas that just require few seconds to do:</p>1. Post your personal link (log in and click the “Link” button below the
video) to your personal LinkedIn, Facebook or any other social media.<br/>2. Post or message to any relevant Forums, LinkedIn Groups or Twitter accounts,
asking them to Share or Retweet.<br/>3. If you or a friend runs a blog or writes, ask them to do a story and
provide your personal URL.

What is the Innovation Deck?
Innovation Deck is a new deck of brainstorming cards for product creators and entrepreneurs. It provides an effective “brain hack” that helps rapidly re-focus on the customer, identify product improvement opportunities and generate ideas.
The Innovation Deck is strategically designed to improve your critical and creative thinking and help you focus on the most crucial product features. As a result, you will be creating better products in shorter time.You’ll get: 

4 Instructional Cards
23 «EXAMINE» cards
23 «EXPLORE» cards
4 «EVALUATE» cards

Each proven technique and question is uniquely formulated to trigger a wealth of responses from your subconscious mind, allowing you to shed light on hidden areas for product improvement (a.k.a. problems).
New innovations begin with the CARDS…
Whenever you are looking to create new invention, developing new solution, or just planning to improve the existing product:
Use the Innovation Deck to create a breakthrough in just 3 simple steps.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1. Take out twenty-three “EXAMINE” cards to examine the problem.


When you are looking for better solutions, you probably ask questions like…
“How to invent something that market will appreciate? What new product ideas would the customer like? What features should I add to my product? What features should I remove?”
“EXAMINE” cards
are strategically designed  to Deep Dive into the problem and laser-in on the
most beneficial answers to these vital questions. 
Example: 5 random cards (you are getting 23 ""EXAMINE"" cards in the deck).What you will be able to do:

Quickly and efficiently laser-in on the
most profitable, helpful, and desirable features you should include in your
product 


Identify crucial improvement
opportunities for your new product





Run small but effective “mini design
reviews”, making sure that your product development project stays on track at
all times

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Step 2. Now use twenty-three
“EXPLORE” cards to explore the wide range of options.
As the greats have
all said, “Want a better answer? Ask a better question…”
“EXPLORE” cards give you the
best and latest brainstorming techniques that have been proven to work in the most challenging industries, combined with the always reliable tools from the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving (TRIZ).
Example: 5 random cards (you are getting 23 ""EXPLORE"" cards in the deck).What you will be able to do:



Quickly generate a wide range of creative
solutions for any difficult technical problem, creating a large pool of
innovative ideas


Get
unstuck FAST by transforming your “mental state” so it elegantly solves the
most challenging technical problems with ease 


Allow
yourself to take a deep breath and relax, because you’ll realize that you
already possess the most innovative solution — you just need the right questions
to allow those solutions to surface 


Transform dull, painful meetings from
“ZZZzzzzzzz” to FUN!* Use this deck as a game: spread the cards on the table,
face down. Turn over one random card, discuss it with the team and see how
novel ideas come to mind

*Most studies on gamification
found a positive effect from the use of game thinking and game mechanics to
engage users in solving problems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Step 3. Apply four “EVALUATE” cards to evaluate the ideas and pick the most promising one.
You’ve EXAMINED and
ferreted out all the potential problems. 
You’ve EXPLORED and
delivered the widest array of saleable solutions. 
Now it’s time to
EVALUATE. 
So now it's time to answer the crucial question:
“Which idea should I invest my time, money
and team resources in?”
“EVALUATE” cards help you to see
a bigger picture. The chosen techniques also help your subconscious mind
naturally review your wide array of solutions, and choose the optimal one. 
Example: 2 random cards (you are getting 4 ""EVALUATE"" cards in the deck).What you will be able to do:


Laser-in to quickly and easily identify
the most optimal, profitable solution, so you save money, energy and
resources — by minimizing unnecessary design
loops and saving TIME 


Stop in-fighting and power games that result in poor solution choice — because the rules of the game is
clear, and the most innovative and winning idea naturally arises!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why should You invest in my idea?It is frighteningly challenging to create new inventions and products.Less than 1% of awarded patents actually find their way to realization in the form of new products. And that’s not all: according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, for those products that get through the hurdles of development and manufacturing, and are launched to the market, over 90 percent will fail in the first four years.At the same time, there are several products on Kickstarter and IndieGoGo that managed to raise over $1’000’000 in just a couple of months.Why is it so difficult to create commercially viable products? And why some products succeed while others fail? I believe our brains are to blame.Our brains are built up in such a way that we delete most of the information that comes our way. We’re deletion machines. For example, if right now you are focused on reading this page, you are likely to delete most of the information around you. You might not notice how warm your feet may feel, or the noise of the computer fan, until I mention it.Similar thing happens when we develop products: once we get a product idea that we believe in, we focus on it. And as we put our idea into the spotlight, we tend to delete everything else.We are so laser-focused on developing our solution, we ignore the inputs from the market, large part of the alternative solutions, and whether there is a better way to add value to the customer.Those who are able to control their focus, create products that sell.Unfortunately, controlling our focus is not always easy.We've all been guilty of jumping right into solution design, rather than seeing whole picture and considering the variety of options.I grew a bit frustrated seeing us innovators buried in details at the very beginning of the concept stage, where “big picture” thinking and open-mindedness matters more. People going in circles, coming up with very similar solutions and not seeing the way out. Companies that spend months and years (and millions of dollars) developing a new product nobody wants.So I sought out a solution — brainstorming cards that help you to re-focus on the customer, quickly identify improvement opportunities and generate a wide variety of solutions when it matters most. Solution that is fast to use and brings instant results.And the Innovation Desk was born.
Who am I?My name is Andrey Schukin. Like you, I am passionate about product innovation and creative problem-solving, which drive me to consistently keep my eyes open for new, more efficient ways to create better products.I am an author of several patents and have been invited as a guest speaker for courses in Problem Solving and Innovation Management at the leading universities in Switzerland and Hong Kong.Before I created the Innovation Deck, I was a multi-stage product development manager for 12 years. I’ve personally plunged off the cliff into the muddied waters of market research, idea selection and proof, IP protection, engineering, manufacturing implementation, and product commercialisation—all while working with large international corporations as well as small start-ups in Sweden, UK and Switzerland, in a wide range of different industries: from power generation and offshore engineering to consumer electronics, telecom and medical devices.I’ve obtained my MSc in Mechanical Engineering, then few years later another degree in Innovation, Creativity and Entrepreneurship, and spent a couple of years learning various languages (the next one going to be Chinese).  Early on I also became interested in psychology and mystery of the human language processing, spending years to pick out the best techniques that I applied in this product.If you are interested to know more about me, please visit my blog at www.InnovationFast.com
Praise for the Innovation DeckWant to know what some of the smartest minds, fast-paced innovators, and uncanny solution finders think about the Innovation Deck—after spending just a few minutes with it?""I love this product and ready to buy it.

Sole Proprietor. 
Make the Innovation Deck YOURS with Branded CardsOutshine your competition with the ultimate gift for your potential customers.Get 30 branded decks, with your company’s logo and details, to position you at the top of your customers’ minds whenever they’re stumped.As an added bonus, you will be able to place 50 words of text (or an image) on the back of the first card.“How will
I put the Innovation Deck to work for me?”
I keep mine on my desk, to provide a quick check-list that guarantees I
understand the problem, can generate the widest array of saleable solutions,
and easily identify the most profitable new product idea.
How you can foresee yourself using it, is up to you…
Whether you’re developing a product alone, stuck in a no-solution
meeting, or working with a team of bull-headed competitors, here’s why you
should always keep The Innovation Deck close at hand.
Here are just a few ways our colleagues benefited from using The
Innovation Deck:
• 
As a Dual-Brained Checklist: Go through the deck methodically, picking
one card after another and spending a minute or two thinking about each
question, allowing you to easily engage both your conscious and subconscious mind to solve your most
challenging problems.
• 
As a Split-Second Inspiration Generator: Pick a random card out of the deck. What
does it say? Is it relevant to your product? Why? What could you do to improve
things further? What else?
• 
As a Zap to the Team Brain: Get together with your team. Spread the
cards on the table, face down. Turn over one random card. Discuss how it is
relevant to your product or problem? Why can you use this now? What’s the best
way to apply the questions? See how many ideas you can trigger from a single
card and you’ll instantly begin to see its value. Once the discussion is
finished, the next team member turns over another random card.


What the Innovation Deck is NOT…
It’s Not Magical (although it might feel that way when you're generating new ideas on demand).
It’s NOT a Golden Pill. 
If you’re an
entrepreneur, engineer, or innovator, you probably already know that to absorb
the full benefits from the Innovation Deck you’ll absolutely need two things:
A)  Attention and a few
minutes of your time to consider the questions on the cards, andB)  A genuine wish to
make your product better. 

And if you let it
just sit on your table, not much will happen. 
Like everything worth
doing, creating spell-binding products requires effort — the Innovation Deck
simply eases your most common challenges, eliminates the mental blocks, and
incites answers from your brain.
QualityAs a colleague, I know how much you value the quality of the products you create. That’s why I have searched long and hard to identify the best suppliers on planet Earth.
I have every assurance that no corners will be cut, ever, in the making of any card in your Innovation Deck, including printing it on the finest multi-layered card stock, with a resistant structured surface—so it retains its shape and durability through years of use. The cards will be delivered to your door in a
handy transparent plastic box — to ensure that extra added measure of protection,
and guarantee they will catch your eye, so you remember to take them out and
generate that Next Big Idea, in seconds.


Schedule

The printing time is expected to take about two weeks and delivery to your door will take another two weeks.  If you order a PDF, we will aim to send it to you within one day.

You’re a Thinker. So you obviously have more questions…
Here are your answers.This page is too long... Can you explain in three sentences how to invent something new?Sure.1. Ask questions from ""Examine"" cards to understand your customer, point out critical issues, and limit the area where you are going to search for solutions. 2. Apply techniques from ""Explore"" cards to generate a variety of different ideas that solve issues and customer pain that you discovered in Step 1.3. Finally, use ""Evaluate"" cards to evaluate all the options you now have, and choose the most optimal solution.Congratulations, your new product idea is created!
Why is the Innovation Deck a better alternative than “brainstorming” cards?
It is NOT your usual manual with a list of random brainstorming questions. It focuses specifically on product invention process, giving you the
best and latest techniques that have been proven to create new inventions in the most challenging industries. 
It also takes into account the way we humans process language and triggers
your unconscious mind to generate solutions for you.
I’m an Entrepreneur. How can I use the Innovation Deck for non-physical products
(software, services, etc.)?
As a forward thinking individual you will find many ways to use the
majority of the cards right away, and the remaining cards as your project
develops.  While the Innovation Deck
originally had a physical product focus, many who deal in the abstract have
touted its unbeatable benefits as well.Why buy several decks? 
Beyond the fact that you should take advantage of our offer to brand
these, and anchor your business as “The Innovator” in the subconscious minds of
your clients, you should buy several decks for your friends, your office, your
teammates…
I believe, as a product creator, that every product creator should have one. Plus card
decks are like toothbrushes – everybody will want to use his/her own.

<div><p>We live in a world driven by technology. Everywhere you look, people are on their cell phones, laptops and gaming devices immersed in the virtual world of innovation. It is estimated that by 2017, 4.4 billion people will be using mobile apps*. As the world becomes more engaged in social media, games, and other distractions, it's easy to become detached and disconnected from the rest of the world. So you have to wonder:<br/></p></div>
<p>Are we losing our humanity?</p>
<p>Technology has the power to impact generations and create our future. What if we created mobile apps that contributed to the Social Good and allowed us to actually connect with our humanity and change the world?</p>
<p>What if we built apps that benefited nonprofit organizations, or contributed to environmental causes, or helped us feed the homeless, or helped bring fresh clean water to impoverished communities? </p>
<p>What if we engaged students and professors from Arizona State University and other colleges, as well as members of local communities skilled in design, technology, civic planning, programming, etc. to collaborate and build these kinds of mobile apps?</p>
<p>At the Hacks 4 Humanity hackathon event happening September 20th-21st, 2014, we will do exactly that!</p>

<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Plan of Action:</h3> <p>Arizona State University Project Humanities and EqualityTV have partnered to create a hackathon event that will contribute to the Social Good!</p>
<p>We have invited ASU students and professors, as well as technology professionals, visionaries, civic planners, and other community organizations and members to take part in the first-ever hackathon at Arizona State University that will focus on building mobile apps and technology solutions that will benefit nonprofit organizations and other causes. The hackathon event will be held at the Sun Devil Fitness Complex at ASU, which was generously contributed by the Sun Devils.</p>
<p>We will engage the 7 Principles of the ""Humanity 101"" curriculum created by ASU Project Humanities. These 7 principles have been identified as virtues that help us reconnect with our humanity and influence generations. </p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>Together, the 7 Principles of the “Humanity 101” curriculum creates an opportunity to be reconnected with our humanity, using compelling values and technology as a foundation. Hackers will develop cutting-edge technology solutions that will solve complex challenges and allow them to engage and innovate in the following seven areas:</p>

<br/><br/><blockquote><p>FORGIVENESS: What can be created that will allow us to practice and demonstrate forgiveness culturally and personally?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>RESPECT: How can we learn to work with and/or engage and help others?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>KINDNESS: What can we build to promote and encourage random or intentional acts of kindness?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>INTEGRITY: How can we build a platform, community or initiative that maintains integrity? Data privacy?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>EMPATHY: How can we reconnect with humanity and empathize with the challenges facing others?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>SELF REFLECTION: Can we explore technology that allows us to dig deeper into ourselves and therefore create personal change?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>COMPASSION: Can we see the world and others differently? What can we build to address the issues affecting humanity?</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>We will organize into groups of 1 - 5 people, and using our sponsored library of API's, open source data, and other contributed resources, we will spend the entire weekend of Sept 20th and 21st building mobile apps. On Sunday, the apps will be presented to a panel of judges who will then choose the top 3-5 projects which will receive sponsored prizes!</p>
<p>The funding we raise will contribute to the immense expenses that need to be covered to run this massive event. We expect between 300-500 participants at Hacks 4 Humanity. Each participant will need meals, beverages and snacks the entire time they are hacking for humanity.</p>
<p>We have presented an attainable goal of $5000 to ensure this campaign is a success, but our budget is extensive and the food costs alone are around $19,000, so every contribution helps us keep the participants fueled so they can focus their creative energy on building technology solutions that will change the world.</p>

<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>How Does Hacks 4 Humanity Change The World?</h3> <p>Building mobile apps that will solve the challenges facing humanity will allow us to tap in deeper to help one another on the planet. </p>
<p>Mobile apps will be taken a step beyond providing distractions and mindless entertainment. We will be able to help homeless people find soup kitchens or shelter, or be able to track the amount of radiation in our city, or help nonprofits manage their day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>When you have a room full of hundreds of people gathered together with the common goal of impacting the world with technology, you're certain to cause a ripple effect and change the entire planet!</p>

</div>*Portio Research Study (March 2013)</div>","Hacks 4 Humanity -- Building Mobile Apps For The Social Good!




We live in a world driven by technology. Everywhere you look, people are on their cell phones, laptops and gaming devices immersed in the virtual world of innovation. It is estimated that by 2017, 4.4 billion people will be using mobile apps*. As the world becomes more engaged in social media, games, and other distractions, it's easy to become detached and disconnected from the rest of the world. So you have to wonder:
Are we losing our humanity?
Technology has the power to impact generations and create our future. What if we created mobile apps that contributed to the Social Good and allowed us to actually connect with our humanity and change the world?
What if we built apps that benefited nonprofit organizations, or contributed to environmental causes, or helped us feed the homeless, or helped bring fresh clean water to impoverished communities? 
What if we engaged students and professors from Arizona State University and other colleges, as well as members of local communities skilled in design, technology, civic planning, programming, etc. to collaborate and build these kinds of mobile apps?
At the Hacks 4 Humanity hackathon event happening September 20th-21st, 2014, we will do exactly that!




  Plan of Action: Arizona State University Project Humanities and EqualityTV have partnered to create a hackathon event that will contribute to the Social Good!
We have invited ASU students and professors, as well as technology professionals, visionaries, civic planners, and other community organizations and members to take part in the first-ever hackathon at Arizona State University that will focus on building mobile apps and technology solutions that will benefit nonprofit organizations and other causes. The hackathon event will be held at the Sun Devil Fitness Complex at ASU, which was generously contributed by the Sun Devils.
We will engage the 7 Principles of the ""Humanity 101"" curriculum created by ASU Project Humanities. These 7 principles have been identified as virtues that help us reconnect with our humanity and influence generations. 


Together, the 7 Principles of the “Humanity 101” curriculum creates an opportunity to be reconnected with our humanity, using compelling values and technology as a foundation. Hackers will develop cutting-edge technology solutions that will solve complex challenges and allow them to engage and innovate in the following seven areas:


FORGIVENESS: What can be created that will allow us to practice and demonstrate forgiveness culturally and personally?
RESPECT: How can we learn to work with and/or engage and help others?
KINDNESS: What can we build to promote and encourage random or intentional acts of kindness?
INTEGRITY: How can we build a platform, community or initiative that maintains integrity? Data privacy?
EMPATHY: How can we reconnect with humanity and empathize with the challenges facing others?
SELF REFLECTION: Can we explore technology that allows us to dig deeper into ourselves and therefore create personal change?
COMPASSION: Can we see the world and others differently? What can we build to address the issues affecting humanity?

We will organize into groups of 1 - 5 people, and using our sponsored library of API's, open source data, and other contributed resources, we will spend the entire weekend of Sept 20th and 21st building mobile apps. On Sunday, the apps will be presented to a panel of judges who will then choose the top 3-5 projects which will receive sponsored prizes!
The funding we raise will contribute to the immense expenses that need to be covered to run this massive event. We expect between 300-500 participants at Hacks 4 Humanity. Each participant will need meals, beverages and snacks the entire time they are hacking for humanity.
We have presented an attainable goal of $5000 to ensure this campaign is a success, but our budget is extensive and the food costs alone are around $19,000, so every contribution helps us keep the participants fueled so they can focus their creative energy on building technology solutions that will change the world.


  How Does Hacks 4 Humanity Change The World? Building mobile apps that will solve the challenges facing humanity will allow us to tap in deeper to help one another on the planet. 
Mobile apps will be taken a step beyond providing distractions and mindless entertainment. We will be able to help homeless people find soup kitchens or shelter, or be able to track the amount of radiation in our city, or help nonprofits manage their day-to-day operations.
The possibilities are endless!
When you have a room full of hundreds of people gathered together with the common goal of impacting the world with technology, you're certain to cause a ripple effect and change the entire planet!

What is Possible? The success of this hackathon relies on the people who 'SHOW UP' and participate in our initiative. This means we need actual participants to sign up and be part of the hackathon. We need sponsors to contribute funding, prizes, open source API's and in-kind contribuitions. We need enough food to feed our participants. We need community members and organizations to get on board and participate and/or support.
If we don't have all of these in place--the event will not be a success! So every little bit helps us achieve greatness.

<h1><a href=""http://shop.sky-tech.com.tw/en/shop3.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></h1>
<h1>Ready to witness the magic on your desktop?</h1>
<p>We’ve designed and built a few functional prototypes of the MagicBox, and we are almost ready to start manufacturing. We need your help to make it happen. By backing our project, you could be first in line to get a MagicBox, and be one step closer to simplifying your workflow, or making your hobby even more enjoyable.  So pick a reward, any reward, and help us make your life much easier, and a whole lot more magical!</p>
<h1>We need a volunteer from the audience</h1>
<p>To begin using the MagicBox just follow these simple directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill the reservoir with acetone.</li>
<li>Place a clean print into the chamber.</li>
<li>Adjust the settings and press start.</li>
<li>Automation Control: For the sake of the safety, we control between inside and outside pressure, we need to keep the pressure  balance,because this is why  vapor always inside and smell nothing.</li>
<li>The clean fan will run after the magical process done.</li>
</ul>
<p>TA-DA!</p>
<h1>Stage magic, meet street magic.</h1>
<p>At Sky-Tech we believe that everything about 3D printing should be fun and inspiring. When we were looking for a solution to polish our own creations, we found that everything else on the market was too big, too expensive, and too difficult to use. So we decided to create our own solution; something that would be small enough to fit on our desks, something that doesn’t require us to pawn our hats and rabbits or buy expensive chemical refills, and something that would be easy for anyone to use. So we designed and built the MagicBox.</p>
<h1>The secrets revealed.</h1>
<p>The MagicBox uses a patent pending process to quickly evaporate acetone. The vapor fills the chamber and begins to smooth out the surface lines from of your FDM prints. After you’re finished, the exhaust fan and filter will capture the excess vapor to ensure that the air in your room stays clean and fresh.</p>
<p><b>Super secret:</b> We have made ​​a compact design to our customers, please note that we design a  vapor switch on control pannel, with the steam setting time, you can control the acetone vapor make different fineness, for example, we can make the surface is very slippery, but the details would lose more, you can make the surface smooth surface only a little, but the details can be preserved.This is called Magicbox customize function.</p>
<p>The MagicBox will be manufactured using the highest-quality components available. Here are some general specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total Size: 30cm x 30cm x 29cm</li>
<li>Chamber Size: 25cm x 25cm x 20cm</li>
<li>Weight: 5kg</li>
<li>Power: 100-240V A/C, 50/60HZ</li>
<li>Works with ABS, PLA</li>
</ul>
<h1>Project background</h1>
<p>1.	After using a beaker filled with acetone over an induction cooker to finish our 3D prints, we began brainstorming a better way and came up with the concept of the MagicBox. We wanted to make the whole process simpler.</p>
<p>2.	Then we began to design a basic controller and chipset to test with.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/667986/files/20140623005319-e33ef0fd037720d56dbb45756c08d389_large.jpg?1403509999"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>3.	We wanted the MagicBox to be used right next to your 3D printer, so we designed it to be small; about the size of a 17 inch monitor. Our first concept drawings. Our first design draft. 3D CAD models of the functional prototype. <br/></p>

<p>4.	We were all excited about the prototype when it was finally ready to test, and after we tested it with a few prints we realized we had made something truly magical. And that is how the MagicBox was born! </p>
<h1>Production and fulfillment plan </h1>
<p>During the campaign, we’ll finalize the design of the MagicBox and prepare for manufacturing with the same manufacturer that produces our high performance 3D printers. Once the campaign is successful, we’ll start mass production for the backers and form a marketing strategy for global sales. At Sky-Tech we have lots of experience manufacturing 3D printers and our customers include product design companies, architecture design companies, colleges, educational institutions, etc. The engineering magic inside the MagicBox is considerably simpler than the mechanisms and electronics in our 3D printers, so you can rest assured that we have the skills and capacity to promptly fulfill our rewards. If you’d like more information on our company please visit our website.</p>

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>Every Indiegogo project comes with unique risks and challenges. Here are some that we might face when producing the Magic Box:</p>
<p>DESIGN &amp; ENGINEERING <br/>The Magic Box is designed to be useful, simple, and safe. We’ve spent countless hours experimenting with the variables to make sure that the user experience is totally magical. However, we might find that after many tests the Magic Box does not hold up to this standard. This will force us to re-engineer certain components which may delay delivery.</p>
<p>PRODUCTION &amp; DELIVERY <br/>We will produce the Magic Box with the best manufacturer we can find for the cost and quality. If for any reason we encounter unforeseen challenges before or during production, we will communicate them to all of our backers and adjust our targets accordingly. That being said, we don’t foresee any challenges so great that they would prevent us from delivering the Magic Box altogether.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>1. Can Magic Box work with PLA prints?<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes, it can work. <br/>Everyone said acetone was only for ABS, but we don't want to use methanol and lye on PLA material because it's too dangerous for our customer. <br/>So we found a way out to adjust the temperature and vapor volume to improve this. <br/>I need to say, the ABS prints is better than PLA prints,but anyway we will try to find the best parameter for this machine for PLA prints use.</p>

Then you need an elegant solution that polishes your creations effortlessly. You need the MagicBox!The magicbox in all its glory!The MagicBox uses an acetone vapor bath to smooth the lines normally present on FDM prints. It’s simple, easy-to-use settings give you control over the look and feel of your creations. Polish out rough edges or preserve detail, it’s up to you.On the right is a duck before being polished.

Ready to witness the magic on your desktop?
We’ve designed and built a few functional prototypes of the MagicBox, and we are almost ready to start manufacturing. We need your help to make it happen. By backing our project, you could be first in line to get a MagicBox, and be one step closer to simplifying your workflow, or making your hobby even more enjoyable.  So pick a reward, any reward, and help us make your life much easier, and a whole lot more magical!
We need a volunteer from the audience
To begin using the MagicBox just follow these simple directions:

Fill the reservoir with acetone.
Place a clean print into the chamber.
Adjust the settings and press start.
Automation Control: For the sake of the safety, we control between inside and outside pressure, we need to keep the pressure  balance,because this is why  vapor always inside and smell nothing.
The clean fan will run after the magical process done.

TA-DA!
Stage magic, meet street magic.
At Sky-Tech we believe that everything about 3D printing should be fun and inspiring. When we were looking for a solution to polish our own creations, we found that everything else on the market was too big, too expensive, and too difficult to use. So we decided to create our own solution; something that would be small enough to fit on our desks, something that doesn’t require us to pawn our hats and rabbits or buy expensive chemical refills, and something that would be easy for anyone to use. So we designed and built the MagicBox.
The secrets revealed.
The MagicBox uses a patent pending process to quickly evaporate acetone. The vapor fills the chamber and begins to smooth out the surface lines from of your FDM prints. After you’re finished, the exhaust fan and filter will capture the excess vapor to ensure that the air in your room stays clean and fresh.
Super secret: We have made ​​a compact design to our customers, please note that we design a  vapor switch on control pannel, with the steam setting time, you can control the acetone vapor make different fineness, for example, we can make the surface is very slippery, but the details would lose more, you can make the surface smooth surface only a little, but the details can be preserved.This is called Magicbox customize function.
The MagicBox will be manufactured using the highest-quality components available. Here are some general specifications:

Total Size: 30cm x 30cm x 29cm
Chamber Size: 25cm x 25cm x 20cm
Weight: 5kg
Power: 100-240V A/C, 50/60HZ
Works with ABS, PLA

Project background
1.	After using a beaker filled with acetone over an induction cooker to finish our 3D prints, we began brainstorming a better way and came up with the concept of the MagicBox. We wanted to make the whole process simpler.
2.	Then we began to design a basic controller and chipset to test with.  



3.	We wanted the MagicBox to be used right next to your 3D printer, so we designed it to be small; about the size of a 17 inch monitor. Our first concept drawings. Our first design draft. 3D CAD models of the functional prototype. 

Our design draw.

           3D  CAD models of the functional prototype.

4.	We were all excited about the prototype when it was finally ready to test, and after we tested it with a few prints we realized we had made something truly magical. And that is how the MagicBox was born! 
Production and fulfillment plan 
During the campaign, we’ll finalize the design of the MagicBox and prepare for manufacturing with the same manufacturer that produces our high performance 3D printers. Once the campaign is successful, we’ll start mass production for the backers and form a marketing strategy for global sales. At Sky-Tech we have lots of experience manufacturing 3D printers and our customers include product design companies, architecture design companies, colleges, educational institutions, etc. The engineering magic inside the MagicBox is considerably simpler than the mechanisms and electronics in our 3D printers, so you can rest assured that we have the skills and capacity to promptly fulfill our rewards. If you’d like more information on our company please visit our website.
Major production stages:
1. MagicBox concept development. ~ 2014/1/15 
2. Prototype development. ~ 2014/2/20 
3. Prototype testing and improving, manufacturing preparations. ~ 2014/07
4. Indiegogo funds start. ~ 2014/07

Yes, it can work. Everyone said acetone was only for ABS, but we don't want to use methanol and lye on PLA material because it's too dangerous for our customer. So we found a way out to adjust the temperature and vapor volume to improve this. I need to say, the ABS prints is better than PLA prints,but anyway we will try to find the best parameter for this machine for PLA prints use.
You can download the Acetone solvent MSDS from our website. http://www.sky-tech.com.tw/sky-tech/doc/magicbox/acetone.msds.pdf2. Can Magic Box work with ABS prints?
Absolutely,it's can work on ABS prints. You can download the Acetone solvent MSDS from our website. http://www.sky-tech.com.tw/sky-tech/doc/magicbox/acetone.msds.pdf3. How big size prints that magic box can handle? Magicbox's chamber size is 25cm x 25cm x 20cm. As long as your prints smaller than this size, then you can smooth it.4. How to buy the acetone?Don't worry, it's very easy to get it, you will found it from hardware store.",41.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>BEER BUDDY HISTORY</strong></p>
<p>A Bottoms Up Beer dispensing system for 5 liter party kegs (169 fl oz Partykeg) - That’s awesome! The Bottoms Up dispensing system is probably the fastest and most spectacular way to get beer into a glass. This idea comes from America and has caused a worldwide buzz.</p>
<p>The perfect beer enjoyment in seconds is made possible by the gentle rise in the glass. This way only a small amount of carbonic acid is lost and your beer tastes particularly fresh. As an official sales partner, we have successfully distributed the system to commercial customers (B2B), such as Restaurants, stadiums and arenas.</p>
<p><strong>But people kept on asking me again and again. “Do you have a Bottoms Up device for domestic use?”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now at last we can say: ""Yes, we do - It is called BEER BUDDY!""</strong></p>

<p>Its all started when we met myself and my partner discussing how can we make something benefit consumers and users around the world. After many researches and reviews, we came up with izone. The Bandwidth Optimization and Data Savings solution came to exist after many years of development. That was 10 years ago.<span style=""background-color: initial;""> Our company is driven by our passion and dedication to our customers and partners. We love what we do. Now its just about time to move to the next level. Our new project is called iZone Cloud... its the core of izone technology but with much advanced technology enabling people around the world to SAVE money, SECURE their Internet and get FASTER Internet.</span></p>This campaign is very important milestone in our history. Its the PRODUCT for today's problems of cost of internet connections, mobility devices, speed and security issues.<p>iZone Cloud is the answer for these concerns. with izone we believe customers will never pay more for data usage. Thats our promise. We plan to empower millions of people around the world with iZone Cloud, be part of this dream. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">How much do we need?</span><br/></p>
</div><div>
<div>We’re looking for at least $125,000 (USD) which will be used to develop new levels of izone cloud, developing new markets and getting it out asap to markets. More funds may be required to expand the R&amp;D even further to develop new compression technology. If we don't reach our target, we are still committed to the business and getting izone to the market by Sep 2014. What we are excited about is the passion we have as a team to make things working and delivering our promises. Committment is what made iZone Cloud today. Part of the funds will go to build a new Data Center in Australia to serve ANZ and APAC markets. <br/>

Our challenges are clear for us and we do take them into considerations such as availability of bandwidth in certain countries, cost of smart devices/phones, data plan cost in various countries. Thats why we are doing our best to make iZone Cloud cost goes down as much as we can. In fact we are planning to make it as low as $2 per month for mobile devices.</p>

Its all started when we met myself and my partner discussing how can we make something benefit consumers and users around the world. After many researches and reviews, we came up with izone. The Bandwidth Optimization and Data Savings solution came to exist after many years of development. That was 10 years ago. Our company is driven by our passion and dedication to our customers and partners. We love what we do. Now its just about time to move to the next level. Our new project is called iZone Cloud... its the core of izone technology but with much advanced technology enabling people around the world to SAVE money, SECURE their Internet and get FASTER Internet.This campaign is very important milestone in our history. Its the PRODUCT for today's problems of cost of internet connections, mobility devices, speed and security issues.iZone Cloud is the answer for these concerns. with izone we believe customers will never pay more for data usage. Thats our promise. We plan to empower millions of people around the world with iZone Cloud, be part of this dream. 
How much do we need?

We’re looking for at least $125,000 (USD) which will be used to develop new levels of izone cloud, developing new markets and getting it out asap to markets. More funds may be required to expand the R&D even further to develop new compression technology. If we don't reach our target, we are still committed to the business and getting izone to the market by Sep 2014. What we are excited about is the passion we have as a team to make things working and delivering our promises. Committment is what made iZone Cloud today. Part of the funds will go to build a new Data Center in Australia to serve ANZ and APAC markets. 
 



The iZone Impact

 Your contribution will make our go-to-market faster and will help us to deliver the new iZone Cloud to consumers worldwide. with iZone Cloud, subscribers get to spend less money on data usage on machines, mobile, tablets and other devices. We love to save money to our customers which they can spend it somewhere else!.  
With our past 10 years to communications and development, our previous version iZone Telecom, the product been used by over 28,000 customers worldwide for the past 10 years. Its just about time to go to next level. the iZone Cloud. Its faster, more secure, and more compression to save date consumption.


Risks & Challenges People during all times they come up with new products and technologies, some we use and some we don't due the nature of the product(s). We believe not everything we invent/develop may be used by others as the cause/needs may not be there. But all people need to be CONNECTED to the Internet, all people need to COMMUNICATE and SHARE moments ,and all people need SPEED and SECURE data transmission.  iZone Cloud is all about these trends and values. Our challenges are clear for us and we do take them into considerations such as availability of bandwidth in certain countries, cost of smart devices/phones, data plan cost in various countries. Thats why we are doing our best to make iZone Cloud cost goes down as much as we can. In fact we are planning to make it as low as $2 per month for mobile devices.


The setup behind iZone Cloud Technology
Thanks to our data centers in Frankfurt, Germany where we can serve clients in Europe and North America extrmely very fast.

<p>We are super fans of the Nintendo Switch. We purchased a set of Nintendo Switch at launch, only to find the included dock is clunky, ugly and not easy to travel with.</p>
<p>We are also Engineers, so realizing this problem we put our thinking caps on and come up with a solution.</p>
<p>It took us one month to design the SFANS adapter and we truly believe it to be a good solution to many of the issues and inconvenience introduced by the original Nintendo  Switch Dock.</p>
<p>We are very proud to share with you what we have achieved. Thank you for checking out our campaign and we hope to get your support!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We love the Nintendo Switch. It is our passion about the Switch that inspires us to develop this SFANS adapter. We have many years of experience in electronic product development. Currently, the product has completed the small-scale trial production, and we will be conducting mass production testing during the campaign. We plan to start shipment in August. Just like any other project, SFANS will face some challenges in the whole process. Therefore, in order to solve these issues, we have taken some measures.</p>
<ol>
<li>We have purchased chips from suppliers to ensure the manufacturing can go smoothly, free from the delay caused by various parts. </li>
<li>We have contacted several manufacturers and signed contracts to ensure the timely shipment. We take the possible issues into our consideration.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will try our best to solve any problems that occur in the process of manufacturing and shipment in order to avoid delays in delivery. We will post updates about the process of SFANS every week, sharing the latest news with you guys. It is your support that will make SFANS happen.</p>
</div></div>","SFANS adapter is the world's first truly portable dock for the Nintendo Switch. SFANS connects to your Nintendo Switch's USB Type-C port and essentially gives you all of the functionality of a docked system. This pocket-sized device is the ultimate option for Switch owners who value mobility over all else.

There's an HDMI port for audiovisual output and a USB Type-C power connection to supply the juice. Two additional USB Type-C and two USB 3.0 allow you to transmit data or charge other devices, like Pro Controllers and Joy-Cons in the premium Joy-Con Grip.

Review from metagamers, YouTube


SFANS has the same function as the official Nintendo Switch dock. When connected to your Switch, it will display your games in 1080P on you TV/Monitor.

 


Using the SFANS adapter is easy. Simply connect your Nintendo Switch, HDMI cable and power source and play on your TV.

  


The compact design of SFANS allows you to put it in your pockets and all travel bags.
Play games on a big screen when going to your friends’ house and traveling. With SFANS adapter, your Nintendo Switch is accessible at anytime and anywhere.



 
          
With the SFANS adapter, you can play games likeThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild at your Switch in TV mode anywhere. SFANS makes easy to play in TV mode anywhere & anytime.



         

Are you concerned about scratching your Nintendo Switch Screen when docking and undocking? With SFANS, you can totally tear off any screen protectors. No more worries about scratching screens.

The dock released by Nintendo Switch will block the air vent at the bottom, which may lead to warping and overheating. SFANS adapter connects the Nintendo Switch via external wiring, without blocking the air vent, eliminating any possibility of warping and improving airflow when used with a stand.
         





Get a useful accessory pack special for backers who just purchase the Switch. Accessories as stickers, cases, screen protectors and AC adapter will be included.

We are super fans of the Nintendo Switch. We purchased a set of Nintendo Switch at launch, only to find the included dock is clunky, ugly and not easy to travel with.
We are also Engineers, so realizing this problem we put our thinking caps on and come up with a solution.
It took us one month to design the SFANS adapter and we truly believe it to be a good solution to many of the issues and inconvenience introduced by the original Nintendo  Switch Dock.
We are very proud to share with you what we have achieved. Thank you for checking out our campaign and we hope to get your support!

For any press inquiries please reach out to info@sfans.store


 
 
What AC adapter do you send?
If you buy the $79 perk, we will send you the corresponding AC adapter. If you are the user of the European standard, we will send the corresponding European power adapter. If you are the UK standard users, we will send the UK power adapter. If you are a user of the American Standard, we will send the American power adapter. You can choose the AC adapter in the survey after the campaign.
Why are you crowdfunding?
We love crowdfunding! For us, it's a perfect solution to ensure we meet minimum order quantities for the first production batch - our tooling is done and we're ready to scale up our manufacturing.
Have you got licensing for the SFANS from Nintendo?
We are looking to get Official Licensing for the SFANS adapter, once we receive full backing we can progress these talks further. Our aim is to receive full licensing before delivery! 
Where does it ship?
We're proud to ship our adapters worldwide. 
How much is shipping?
Please see reward details for all other locations. Local taxes not included.
I'm interested in a distribution partnership.
Please contact info@sfans.store and include in your email the region(s) you distribute to.
How can I check the status of my pre-order?
By pre-ordering through Indiegogo, you automatically have an account created. Log back into Indiegogo using the email you pre-ordered, to verify your information.

<p>We are a Chinese manufacturer located in Shenzhen, China. Our factory covers an area of 20,000 square meters and has more than 80 staff.</p>
<p>Why Indiegogo</p>
<p>We sold more than 120,000 monitors worldwide last year, mostly ODM for a few big-name brands. We decided to sell directly to customers and provide our customers the high-quality monitors with a reasonable price without the middlemen increasing the rate. We see Indiegogo as the first step to the international market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Manufacturing</p>
<p>Everything up to this point has already been prepared and we are ready for mass production. We will start to deliver the monitor once we get more than 100 orders. It typically takes one to two weeks to arrive at your doorstep.  Since we ourselves are the supplier, we are confident in quality control and will make our best to ensure there is no delay in manufacturing. We will be 100% honest with you and keep you updated with everything.</p>
</div></div>","We have started shipping the Sculptor starting on April 2nd, with worldwide free shipping, so you got nothing to worry about!
Almost everyone who works in an office prefer to have a second monitor at work, as it boosts productivity so much. However, what if we are not tied down to a set desk, what if we work on the go? Well, we have the solution, an ultra-thin, highly portable monitor, the Sculptor!

Coming in at 15.6"" with razor sharp 4K resolution, we are confident the Sculptor is the best portable monitor you can find anywhere. It's smart too: it auto-rotates to switch between landscape and portrait mode; and it is ultra slim, so it is super easy to take with you anywhere. It also works with smartphones, transforming your iPhone or Android into a mobile work station. The Sculptor's wide range of compatibility allows you to connect it to your laptops, smartphones, consoles, cameras and so on! 







You can use Sculptor with any device you can think of! Connect it to your laptop or desktop computer to use it as an extra screen to boost your productivity. Or connect it to your PS4, XBOX One or Nintendo Switch to enjoy a more immersive gaming experience anywhere you go! Connect it to your smartphone to turn it into a workstation and nail that last-minute assignment with ease. Connect it to your camera and start livestreaming! And its 4K resolution gives absolutely crystal clear display!


What sets Sculptor apart is that this amazing monitor detects your hand movement and auto-rotates accordingly, so you can switch from landscape to portrait orientation without breaking a sweat. Unlike other monitors on the market, you don’t need to rotate your device for the monitor to rotate, which makes it super convenient.

No more hassles when you are trying to live stream, simply connect Sculpter to your camera and voila! Live streaming using your camera has never been easier!
Beside the 0 latency touch response, the built-in touch menu of Scuptor also makes this device super easy to use. Now productivity just got taken to a whole new level!
 It is not just working with the Sculptor, use it with your gaming system as well. Connect it to your PS4, Xbox or Nintendo Switch or any other consoles to enjoy a better gaming experience.

Kickstand comes in handy when you are using the Sculptor, this is truly the most convenient portable monitor you can have!

Pulp is the primary raw material of the paper industry. While the conventional paper-making industry uses tree pulp to make paper, it can easily be replaced by other environment-friendly sources like dung. Elephant dung is especially suited for making pulp because elephants are poor digesters – the majority of the more than 250 pounds of their daily vegetarian diet is passed as undigested plant fiber, which is long enough to be converted into pulp!</span></p><p></p><p>Making paper from the dung is a simple six-step process: <br/>1.The dung is collected and dried.<br/>2. It is boiled for eight hours using a few disinfectants to remove all the bacteria.<br/>3. It is then crushed to make pulp.<br/>4. The pulp is separated based on mesh size and sifted over wooden frames to achieve the required paper thickness.<br/>5. The sheets are sun dried and then wrapped around hot air tubes to remove the moisture and dust completely. <br/>6.

<p></p></div>","Elephants are some of the most intelligent and emotionally complex animals on Earth. Elephants are important because they are a keystone species: without them, entire ecosystems cease to exist.  But today elephants are in danger and it is the last chance we have to save them. With one elephant being killed for its ivory tusks every 15 minutes, almost 100 per day, these majestic, iconic creatures could be extinct within the decade.  Elephants are being killed at an unprecedented rate for their ivory tusks to meet the demand from China. Today, the price of Ivory has skyrocketed, fetching thousands of dollars for a pair. The following figure shows how Ivory from Africa reaches China and all the other countries through a very complicated supply channel.While many efforts are underway to reduce the ivory demand, brought on by the increasingly wealthy Chinese middle class, there is still an enormous amount of work that needs to be done to limit the supply. One of the largest contributing factors that need to be addressed is the extreme poverty that exists in many African countries. If people are unable to provide for their families, any job will do, even if that job is poaching. For poachers, elephants are worth way more dead than they are alive.Our mission at Elephant Pie is to reverse that thinking by providing income opportunities to the locals. We have to make them realize that AN ELEPHANT IS WORTH WAY MORE ALIVE THAN DEAD.How did we design the products?Having developed the paper, we were faced with two challenges.1. To develop products made from the dung paper that are practical & creative enough to ensure a continuous demand so as to make it possible for us to procure dung and pay the locals.2. To make products that can spread awareness and educate people about the crisis at hand. Help us inspire locals to fight against the horrors of poaching to save the elephants! Don't let us be on the wrong side of history. Make a stand and support this project by pledging, sharing the project with your friends and spreading awareness about the crisis.Everybody needs a place on their desk to store pens and display business cards. But what if your pen/card holder was multi-functional AND helped support elephant conservation efforts, too?  Named after the Greek goddess Artemis, the protector of wild animals, our desk ornament functions as a Pen Holder, Vase, Business Card Holder, and Docking Station! At 7.9” high, this graceful beauty made of fine Poly resin will enhance your desk/home and be a visual reminder of your love of elephants!ARTEMIS can be completely personalized with a combination of words (a maximum of 20 letters) and logos as shown in the photos below.You can send your logo/text in any format. Our design team will render a picture of ARTEMIS with your logo/text and send for approval. The reward also includes up to two revisions.According to recent estimates, more than 10 billion business cards are printed in the U.S. every year, while 80% of the cards distributed are discarded within a week. However, the remaining 20% really do work. For every 2,000 cards distributed, it is estimated that sales increase by about 2.5%.You can upload your existing design or send us your logo and details. Our team will design the best card for you and offer up to 2 revisions.
Elephant Pie offers three beautiful journals: A Tribute to Qumquat; 10 Years Until Extinction; and Keep Calm and Go Vegan. Each journal is bound with a hard cover and is made of 100gsm elephant dung paper with a smooth, double-rolled finish. The journals are available in three page formats: both pages lined; one page lined and the opposing page blank; both pages blank. Each notebook is 100% vegan (just like elephants!) and measure 8.3”x 5.8”.My Elephant Activity Book has a range of fun-filled activities to educate children about elephants and teach empathy for other sentient beings.Contains a range of Creative Puzzles, Mazes, Coloring Pages, Stories, Word Searches etc, to help kids learn in a fun way.Never lose your place in a book or magazine again! These adorable bookmarks are made of durable elephant dung cardboard and measure 4"" long. There are five sweet designs - three elephants and two trees - and come in two packs.This reward will give you an opportunity to experience a trip of a lifetime. A five day Safari will be provided by one of the top tourist companies in Tanzania along with a visit to Elephant Pie's collection Center.This package includes air fare, accommodation, travelling & food.This mini version is designed with a few limitations keeping the environment and eco-system in consideration. 1. A complete set CANNOT process more than 150 kg of dung a day. This is roughly equal to the dung coming from three elephants.2. Sale is limited to sanctuaries/organizations involved in conserving elephants. A sanctuary/organization will not be sold more than one complete set.3. We will not be selling the set to any Zoo or place holding captive elephants.Making paper from dung is a very simple process. Pulp is the primary raw material of the paper industry. While the conventional paper-making industry uses tree pulp to make paper, it can easily be replaced by other environment-friendly sources like dung. Elephant dung is especially suited for making pulp because elephants are poor digesters – the majority of the more than 250 pounds of their daily vegetarian diet is passed as undigested plant fiber, which is long enough to be converted into pulp!Making paper from the dung is a simple six-step process: 1.The dung is collected and dried.2. It is boiled for eight hours using a few disinfectants to remove all the bacteria.3. It is then crushed to make pulp.4. The pulp is separated based on mesh size and sifted over wooden frames to achieve the required paper thickness.5. The sheets are sun dried and then wrapped around hot air tubes to remove the moisture and dust completely. 6. Sheets are sprayed with a special finishing agent and double-rolled to achieve the required finish and texture.WHERE ARE WE SO FAR?Over the last one year, we have worked really hard on developing this paper to make it smooth and user friendly so that it is easy for people to replace their tree pulp paper with elephant dung paper and support the cause. A special 3 rolled calendar was fabricated to achieve this purpose. As shown in the picture, second and third roll have steam inlets making it possible to take the surface temperature to more than 100 C. This helps in embedding any fibers on the surface and resulting in a smooth finish.We took a major stride in our development process when we tried adding a 5 micron natural filler to our pulp. This resulted in a very smooth texture and also helped in improving the color of the paper. We are really thankful to our consultant Mr. Richard James for his support.An interesting aspect of our equipment is that it is completely portable. The machines were fabricated in a way that packing them up from one location and installing in a new place is very easy and takes less than a day. All the machines except for the boiler are plug and play. The boiler is connected to the mixing bath (dung and water is mixed and boiled for 8 hours) and the tube dryer through steam pipes (takes less than an hour to weld). The boiler is also designed in a way that it has a kiln connected to the chamber housing the tubes. The kiln is fabricated with the view of using cow dung/other environment friendly solid waste as a source of fuel.We have also finalized a location in the village of Minjingu, Tanzania to kickstart our first dung collection center. Bulk production of ARTEMIS will take place in Taiwan. We have developed a very strong relationship with the manufacturer & have forwarded the STL files so that they can work on them and make their molds. Once the project ends, the manufacturer will be able to start the production immediately.We have the process developed, we have the equipment, but we need to reach out and gather support or else the true purpose of this project falls short. We need to show that there is a demand for change, a demand for action, a demand for alternative and viable ways for locals to support themselves.Websiteswww.elephantpie.orgwww.MarchforElephants.orgFacebookhttps://www.facebook.com/ElePiehttps://www.facebook.com/GiveAShitAboutElephantsTwitterhttps://twitter.com/ElephantPie2This project wouldn't have been possible without the support of following people.Maria Mossman (London) for her suggestions & supportJudy Maxwell (British Columbia) for always being there to support the elephants and this projectBarbara Garrett (San Francisco) for her valuable editingVirginia Woolf (Auckland) for letting us use her poem Aafeez Jivraj (Arusha) for highlighting the areas worst hit by poachingMr Kamal Ahmed (Arusha) for his commitment to this projectMr Patirana (Sri Lanka) for helping & training our staff and giving us valuable insights into the art of paper making.Mr Richard James( Manchester, UK) for providing us the consultancy and sharing his knowledge with us.Risks and Challenges We have worked really hard in eliminating all the potential obstacles.

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Fidgeters of the world unite! Introducing Masta Box, a fidget gadget that will change the way you think about fidget toys forever! Masta Box is an Air Mouse, a Joystick, a Presenter (with Laser Pointer)and a Micro SD card reader.

 
Fidget toys are nothing new, and they have served one function well - satisfying the need to fidget. The team at Masta Box wants more - we have re-engineered an ordinary fidget cube and made it a Bluetooth device that is packed with general functions, all in a compact cube.


At Masta Box, we are all certified Class-A fidgeters. Fidgeters get attached to their little fidget toys and bring them everywhere they go. That's why we make Masta Box. It saves us from packing another device by combining a seemingly simple fidget cube with the functions of a universal Bluetooth controller. With Masta Box, you can do many cool and useful things both at home and at work.

Masta Box is compatible with both PC and Mac via Bluetooth 4.2. It works as a universal controller for presentation, browsing the Internet, playing music and video, last but not least - a perfect fidget toy!

<p>Bevis Long likes to roll up his sleeves and get hands-on, so he makes and fixes most of his stuff in and around his house. Years ago, after learning about magnet and electromagnetic induction principle in a science class in primary school, he cracked open his father’s beloved tape recorder just to see how loudspeakers work. Being found out, he was very afraid that dad would punish him. To his surprise, his father didn’t, but instead encouraged him to put the machine back together and make it work again. Now a father himself, he encourages his children to make, break and fix things, and he spares as much time as possible to do this with them. “This is the way we bond and how they learn.” He found in the market electric screwdrivers big, for professional, heavy duty uses, and small, for electronics, but nothing in between. That’s when the idea of iFu BS1 came into being. With his kids in mind, he made sure it is safe for children as well.</p>

Timeline

 
Behind the Scene

Bevis Long likes to roll up his sleeves and get hands-on, so he makes and fixes most of his stuff in and around his house. Years ago, after learning about magnet and electromagnetic induction principle in a science class in primary school, he cracked open his father’s beloved tape recorder just to see how loudspeakers work. Being found out, he was very afraid that dad would punish him. To his surprise, his father didn’t, but instead encouraged him to put the machine back together and make it work again. Now a father himself, he encourages his children to make, break and fix things, and he spares as much time as possible to do this with them. “This is the way we bond and how they learn.” He found in the market electric screwdrivers big, for professional, heavy duty uses, and small, for electronics, but nothing in between. That’s when the idea of iFu BS1 came into being. With his kids in mind, he made sure it is safe for children as well.",20.0,1,"2 Campaigns

An introduction to the PetFeedr IdeaThe PetFeedr idea itself is a few
months away to launch the planning and fundraising stages, but we think its
important to give you, our first pre-development backers, some information
about who and what 'PetFeedr' is!
PetFeedr is an idea from our founder,
David, that helps pet owners feed and monitor their pets while they are out of
the house.
Our device will be an easy

well. Due to the unit being modular, we are
able to create more add-ons for the device - for example a treat dispenser
and water fountain - which will be added via a simple update.

The stage we are at just now:We are currently in the process of
building the hardware side. We are using the Raspberry Pi as our hardware
controller with motors and cameras to enable the control and
monitoring of the device.The unit we have for testing successful completed a picture test,  an example of the capabilities is below.

In just three weeks, I’m embarking on a new adventure, teaching a six week photojournalism course at the Royal University in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. <br/><br/> All of my expenses for the trip are being paid for by a Fulbright scholarship, but I’ve recently discovered that most of my students do not own and cannot afford cameras.  That’s where you all come in! I need funding to buy simple digital cameras for Cambodia’s next generation of photojournalists. <br/><br/><br/><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong><br/><br/>What I am looking for is a minimum of  $2500 to purchase used digital SLR cameras (and associated gear- cards, flashes, card readers, etc) to put into the hands of budding Cambodian photojournalists. The cameras will all be donated to the Royal University where they can be shared by multiple students for years to come. <br/><br/>I am also happy to accept donations of actual cameras. I am looking for digital SLR cameras with manual control over shutter speed and aperture. They can be old or new, just as long as they work! <br/><br/>While in Cambodia I will also be shooting for a book project, and in return for your donations I will be offering everything from email updates and Facebook kudos to signed photographic prints of my favorite images from the trip (you can check out my work at <a href=""http://www.dennisdrenner.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.dennisdrenner.com</a> to see if you like my style). <br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Why This Is Important</strong> <br/><br/>Some quick background on Cambodia: It is a small country of about 15 million people in Southeast Asia that is just beginning to pull itself back together after decades of conflict. The Vietnam War spilled over into the country, leading to the rise of the Khmer Rouge in the mid-70s.  This group perpetrated one of the worst genocides in history, taking the lives of about two million people through execution, forced labor and starvation.  The group made a special target of intellectuals and professionals, and by the end of the their rule in 1979, the country had lost much of its institutional knowledge in a wide range of fields, including everything from medicine and engineering to painting, music and photography. <br/><br/>With this in mind, my project is designed to breath new life into Cambodian photojournalism.  I hope to help inspire a new generation of Cambodian photographers so they can go out, tell their own stories and contribute to a robust media in their fledgling democracy. (Considering the 22% illiteracy rate among Cambodian adults, story telling with photography is especially important!) I will do this not only with my own teaching, but by forging new connections between my university in Cambodia and my photographic colleagues in the US and abroad, making it easier for other experienced photographers to follow in my footsteps. <br/><br/>In my free time, I will also be shooting my own pictures, with a goal of making significant progress towards a photography book on the country. <br/><br/>Money pledged toward the project will go towards the purchase of simple digital SLR cameras, which I will donate to the Royal University where they can be shared by multiple students. My own expenses are already covered by my grant, as mentioned above <br/><br/>Thank you for taking the  time to read about my project.  Any donation, no matter how small, will help!  Also -- please help spread the word!<br/><br/></p></div>","Summary My name is Dennis Drenner and I’m a Baltimore, Maryland-based photojournalist.

What We Need & What You GetWhat I am looking for is a minimum of  $2500 to purchase used digital SLR cameras (and associated gear- cards, flashes, card readers, etc) to put into the hands of budding Cambodian photojournalists. The cameras will all be donated to the Royal University where they can be shared by multiple students for years to come. I am also happy to accept donations of actual cameras. I am looking for digital SLR cameras with manual control over shutter speed and aperture. They can be old or new, just as long as they work! While in Cambodia I will also be shooting for a book project, and in return for your donations I will be offering everything from email updates and Facebook kudos to signed photographic prints of my favorite images from the trip (you can check out my work at www.dennisdrenner.com to see if you like my style). Why This Is Important Some quick background on Cambodia: It is a small country of about 15 million people in Southeast Asia that is just beginning to pull itself back together after decades of conflict. The Vietnam War spilled over into the country, leading to the rise of the Khmer Rouge in the mid-70s.  This group perpetrated one of the worst genocides in history, taking the lives of about two million people through execution, forced labor and starvation.  The group made a special target of intellectuals and professionals, and by the end of the their rule in 1979, the country had lost much of its institutional knowledge in a wide range of fields, including everything from medicine and engineering to painting, music and photography. With this in mind, my project is designed to breath new life into Cambodian photojournalism.  I hope to help inspire a new generation of Cambodian photographers so they can go out, tell their own stories and contribute to a robust media in their fledgling democracy. (Considering the 22% illiteracy rate among Cambodian adults, story telling with photography is especially important!) I will do this not only with my own teaching, but by forging new connections between my university in Cambodia and my photographic colleagues in the US and abroad, making it easier for other experienced photographers to follow in my footsteps. In my free time, I will also be shooting my own pictures, with a goal of making significant progress towards a photography book on the country. Money pledged toward the project will go towards the purchase of simple digital SLR cameras, which I will donate to the Royal University where they can be shared by multiple students. My own expenses are already covered by my grant, as mentioned above Thank you for taking the  time to read about my project.  Any donation, no matter how small, will help!  Also -- please help spread the word!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The central part, the extruder, is certainly the most important: it is a
MK7 model that has been modified to make it reliable. To give consistency to
the 3D printer, we have created an enclosure cover (easily removable with
magnets and a system of LEDs that illuminate the object that you are printing)
that makes this part attractive and safe from any contact.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/478311/files/20140402065728-extruder-inventone-makerdreams-nozzle.png?1396447048"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Closed enclosure</i></p>
<p></p><p>iNventOne has been designed as a closed enclosure to
stabilize the printing environment, improve results and make the area safer.
When the created part cools down (especially if ABS is used) irregularly or too
quickly, it is compressed incorrectly, causing cracks and delaminations. Our
enclosure serves several purposes: it prevents external thermal influences in
your print by blocking drafts and keeping the internal temperature stable, it
also creates a barrier to prevent any person from coming into contact with hot
parts thus avoiding any type of injury, especially in the presence of children. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/368823/files/20140213142010-100.png?1392330010"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Mechanics </i></p>
<p></p><p>Thanks to our experience in the field of mechanics, we

certainly the most suitable for this kind of application and do not require
routine maintenance. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/243912/files/20131205080448-guide-linear-ricircolo-di-sfere-stampante3D-makerdreams.jpg?1386259488"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><i></i></p><p>A higher print volume </p>

Shipping costs may vary depending on the location and country. It is easier and
less expensive for you to handle shipping out from indiegogo. When the campaign
is finished, you will receive a link to our website where you can enter
shipping information and pay the exact amount.</p>
<p>- How much will shipping cost me?<br/>
If you live within the European Union, the shipping cost is approximately $ 45.
If you live anywhere else in the world, the shipping cost is approximately $
180.</p>
<p>- What freight carrier do you use?<br/>
For shipping we use MBE (international) and other services for Europe. For this
reason the orders will be always traceable.</p>
<p>- What print materials can I use?<br/>
We care about your health, so we must say that PLA is the best material to
protect you and the environment as well as being easy to use and suitable for
all prints. That said there is still the possibility of using any other
material available.</p>
<p>- Which operating systems can I use with iNventOne?<br/>
It works with Mac, but also Windows and Linux. Available for download on our
website.</p>
<p>- Do you have a heated bed?<span>The cre<span>ated prototype does not
have a heated bed, because it is not required by the PLA. However our
motherboard is designed for it, and it will be installed to reach the final
goal.</span></span></p>
<p>- How much does the material cost?<br/>
In addition to our wire coils, you can buy the material from the website that
you prefer, but you might lose your warranty not having the certification of
the product you are using. </p>
<p>- What power supply do you use?<br/>
The 12V power supply is internal to the printer and it has an European outlet.
So if you have any problems, you will need an adapter easily affordable. </p>
<p>- Only USB connection?<br/>
To connect and use the 3D printer there is a USB A/USB B connection. We want to
study a motherboard with WiFi and SD card reader.</p>
<p>- How will you deliver on time your printers having
many orders?<br/>
iNventOne was designed to be constructed in three separate blocks and
subsequently assembled, this makes the production simpler and faster.</p>
<p>- What are your plans if a part is defective or
broken?<br/>
If the printer has really malfunctioning parts due to production, they will be
replaced without any problems. You just have to send us the damaged piece and
we will send you a new one.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/424803/files/20140310143930-maker-dreams-thanks-you-indegogo-3d-printer.png?1394487570"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

The central part, the extruder, is certainly the most important: it is a
MK7 model that has been modified to make it reliable. To give consistency to
the 3D printer, we have created an enclosure cover (easily removable with
magnets and a system of LEDs that illuminate the object that you are printing)
that makes this part attractive and safe from any contact.Closed enclosure
iNventOne has been designed as a closed enclosure to
stabilize the printing environment, improve results and make the area safer.
When the created part cools down (especially if ABS is used) irregularly or too
quickly, it is compressed incorrectly, causing cracks and delaminations. Our
enclosure serves several purposes: it prevents external thermal influences in
your print by blocking drafts and keeping the internal temperature stable, it
also creates a barrier to prevent any person from coming into contact with hot
parts thus avoiding any type of injury, especially in the presence of children. Mechanics 
Thanks to our experience in the field of mechanics, we
have created an accurate and reliable product, choosing linear guidance systems
with recirculating ball bearing carriers. These products are expensive but
certainly the most suitable for this kind of application and do not require
routine maintenance. A higher print volume 
We have achieved a higher than average print volume,
which can meet the needs of most of you, should you be professionals who need
large prototypes or amateurs that create small pieces to be used in everyday
life.
280x210x200 mm (11.02x8.2x7.8 inches) of space for
your creativity, now everything can be reproduced.SoftwareWe currently use Cura 14.01 as print management
program, but with your help we hope to create our exclusive software that will
be provided free of charge and will be downloaded in the download section of
our website. Our printer can also be used with the majority of open source
programs such as Pronterface or Repetier-Host.The features can be improved,
everything depends on the final outcome of the fundraising campaign. Our
development process never stops. We want to give you the opportunity to modify
iNventOne at your convenience by changing the transparency of cover plates,
changing the firmware, installing a heated plane, and anything else that may allow you to adapt the
3D printer to your personal needs.
MakerDreams is now an Italian startup, but during this
campaign it will become a Ltd. based in London (UK), a strategic point which
will allow us to have greater visibility and be closer to all our fans.
Currently it is just the two of us, Luca Faggiotto and Federico Faggiotto, but
we hope to expand quickly and add to our team a computer engineer and other
contributors, as well as to make our products and services more efficient and
faster thus bringing forward the next generation of 3D printers.
Not having investors and funds behind us, we hope that
this crowdfunding campaign will be the springboard to make our dream come true
with you. The timeline will help you understand the time required for
production processes and where your investments will be addressed. We will do
our utmost to reduce waiting times and we will keep you updated on the various
stages.What we hope this to be in the future


We are working
to create a printing software to be used with iNventOne to provide more
simplicity and functionality of use.





Currently the
front panel of the prototype is easily removable by means of the magnets, but
we are studying an opening system that does not obstruct the view and the
extraction of the plexiglas plane.





The wiring coming to the extruder will be replaced by a flat cable with
connectors to simplify installation and maintenance, so nothing will be visible
because all the wires will pass inside the vertical aluminum section





An important
step will be to implement a motherboard designed specifically for our printer.






With a new
control board we would like to install a WiFi system and a SD card reader or
USB port, so you can use the printer without a PC.






Create a plus
version with the addition of a heated bed (which is already possible for those
who wish to self-build a plane different from plexiglas).






Some of the
pieces of iNventOne are printed by us (such as the enclosure and the coil
holder) and this step takes time. To avoid this problem we would like to lean
on firms to create professional molds and speed up production.






Various
improvements to the firmware, expanding the team of MakerDreams.






For the future
we want to start a program together with a charity association and give our
printers to the greatest number of people in Africa, to help them to develop and
construct useful items and implants for mutilated people. This is certainly our
biggest and most important dream.



The prototype will be the same, if not better, as the consumer version that
will come to you. All this will be possible if your help to our project will be
as big as our dreams.Stretch GoalsWe are excited to offer some new stretch goals that
will benefit all of our backers at the $999 pledge level and higher. As we gain
more backers it gives us some better purchasing power, which in turn reduces
our cost. We want to make sure to pass on the savings to you.FAQs- Why the shipping costs are not included?
Shipping costs may vary depending on the location and country. It is easier and
less expensive for you to handle shipping out from indiegogo. When the campaign
is finished, you will receive a link to our website where you can enter
shipping information and pay the exact amount.
- How much will shipping cost me?
If you live within the European Union, the shipping cost is approximately $ 45.
If you live anywhere else in the world, the shipping cost is approximately $
180.
- What freight carrier do you use?
For shipping we use MBE (international) and other services for Europe. For this
reason the orders will be always traceable.
- What print materials can I use?
We care about your health, so we must say that PLA is the best material to
protect you and the environment as well as being easy to use and suitable for
all prints. That said there is still the possibility of using any other
material available.
- Which operating systems can I use with iNventOne?
It works with Mac, but also Windows and Linux. Available for download on our
website.
- Do you have a heated bed?The created prototype does not
have a heated bed, because it is not required by the PLA. However our
motherboard is designed for it, and it will be installed to reach the final
goal.
- How much does the material cost?
In addition to our wire coils, you can buy the material from the website that
you prefer, but you might lose your warranty not having the certification of
the product you are using. 
- What power supply do you use?
The 12V power supply is internal to the printer and it has an European outlet.
So if you have any problems, you will need an adapter easily affordable. 
- Only USB connection?
To connect and use the 3D printer there is a USB A/USB B connection. We want to
study a motherboard with WiFi and SD card reader.
- How will you deliver on time your printers having
many orders?
iNventOne was designed to be constructed in three separate blocks and
subsequently assembled, this makes the production simpler and faster.
- What are your plans if a part is defective or
broken?
If the printer has really malfunctioning parts due to production, they will be
replaced without any problems. You just have to send us the damaged piece and
we will send you a new one.",19.0,1,"1 Campaign

We would like to make this process easier and more accessible to everyone. 6 - Make it easier to create and add new chartsMore documentations and ready to use templates based on a completely refactored JavaScript library. 7 - More educational material to teach and learn RAWGraphs    Since RAWGraphs is widely used in many educational programs we want to improve our learning section with more tutorials and more samples. We will also create more material and guides for developers to learn how to add custom charts and participate in the development of the tool.What happens if we exceed our goal?We have a lot of things in mind to improve RAWGraphs. If your contributions exceed our goal (33,000 €) we will have more time to spend on the design and development of RAWGraphs 2.0.Here is our dream to-do list: 
More charts, more charts, more charts!
Add the possibility to make simple data transformations (filter, geocoding, etc)
RAWGraphs App: the offline and stand-alone version of the application that you can install on your computer
Export to GIST
 And last but not least...Interactive charts! Yes, we would love to add the possibility to create interactive charts and have an easy way to embed them in web pages and interactive projects.Risks and challengesRAWGraphs is a pretty simple software. Adding more functionalities will make the software more complex (to design and develop) and we need time to do so. The risk is that the schedule we have in mind could become tight and the new version will require more time than expected. But don’t worry, the latest stable version of RAWGraphs will be always available online and, if you support us with 50€ you will have early access to the beta version.What if we don’t succeed? The campaign will be anyway flexible, meaning that even if we won't reach that goal, we will work according to the founding we manage to collect.Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand that some might not have the means to contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Share our campaign online using the share tools in this page

<p>We love design. We love art. We love tattoos. But we haven't been ready to take the permanent plunge.</p>
<p>We wanted temporary tattoos that we could proudly wear in public - tattoos that wouldn’t look fake and silly. </p>
<p>And that’s why we created this little thing here.</p>

<p>The inkbox is a fruit-based tattoo that lasts two weeks, and only takes 10 minutes to apply.  It looks and feels just like a real tattoo, without the commitment.</p>

<p>1. Peel the back off of the inkbox. </p>
<p>2. Place it on the skin where you want your tattoo to appear. </p>
<p>3. Run the provided towelette under water for 3 seconds.</p>
<p>4. Put on the provided black tattoo glove and hold the towelette over the black square in the middle for 10 minutes, with firm pressure. </p>
<p>5. Remove the stencil and wait.</p>
<p>The tattoo magically appears over the next 12-24 hours. We like to put them on before bed and then wake-up with a tattoo!</p>

<p><b>The inkbox consists of 4 layers:</b></p>
<p>1. The first layer is an adhesive stencil.</p>
<p>2. The second layer is a non-woven that contains our organic inkbox formula. </p>
<p>3. The third layer protects your hands from getting stained. </p>
<p>4. The fourth layer holds it all together, like a hug.  </p>
<p>When wet, the active inkbox formula is absorbed into your skin in the shape of the stencil.</p>

<p>The patent-pending inkbox formula is 100% organic and made from a fruit. It’s safe for your skin and safe for all ages. It works by reacting with organic compounds in your skin, effectively turning the structural proteins in the top layer of your skin black.</p>
<p>Unlike temporary tattoos that sit on top of your skin, ours sit in your skin, like a real tattoo. Tattoos stain the Dermis (the second layer of skin) and our formula stains the Epidermis (the first layer of skin). The reason tattoos stay forever is because the Dermis doesn’t exfoliate like the Epidermis.</p>

<p>We can do some cool things with our inkbox tattoos, but we can’t replicate the full gamut of tattoo art. From shading to pointillism, there are certain things our tattoos cannot currently replicate (but we’re working on it!). Tattooing is an art form and we don’t wish to disrupt that, but rather, we wish to co-exist alongside it as a form of self-expression. </p>

<p>This is a product we both wanted in our lives. We're making inkbox as awesome as possible because we're our own biggest customers. We’ve been selling a previous type of fruit-based tattoo for 7 months now and we personally talk to many of our customers, listening closely to what they want to see. Their feedback, combined with our own desire for semi-permanent tattoos, is the reason we created the new inkbox tattoo.</p>
<h2><b>Our story</b></h2>

<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1447719465/im3n5aiizpic7bbdgbjd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As brothers we've always worked on things together.  As children we would ride our bikes around our hometown and purchase second-hand sporting equipment that we would then sell back to our local used sporting goods store for a profit. We're pretty sure we kept that place afloat for a few years as 10 and 13-year-olds.</span></p>
<p>When Tyler moved away for 4 years we lost contact.  2 years ago Tyler came back. When we came up with the concept for inkbox we decided to rekindle our brotherhood and work on something together again. Some say don't mix family and business, but for us it has always been closely intertwined. To us, business is about sharing the same values with each other and our customers.  inkbox is a family affair through and through. </p>

We love design. We love art. We love tattoos. But we haven't been ready to take the permanent plunge.
We wanted temporary tattoos that we could proudly wear in public - tattoos that wouldn’t look fake and silly. 
And that’s why we created this little thing here.


The inkbox is a fruit-based tattoo that lasts two weeks, and only takes 10 minutes to apply.  It looks and feels just like a real tattoo, without the commitment.

How it works


Application in 5 easy steps:
1. Peel the back off of the inkbox. 
2. Place it on the skin where you want your tattoo to appear. 
3. Run the provided towelette under water for 3 seconds.
4. Put on the provided black tattoo glove and hold the towelette over the black square in the middle for 10 minutes, with firm pressure. 
5. Remove the stencil and wait.
The tattoo magically appears over the next 12-24 hours. We like to put them on before bed and then wake-up with a tattoo!


Over 300 designs from which to choose
When you pre-order we'll send you a survey to choose your design from getinkbox.com (We've been selling our previous type of tattoo here).
See the rewards section for ordering a custom design.




The inkbox comes in 7 different sizes to fit designs anywhere from 0.5 inches to 5 inches. 



Composition 

We’re working with world’s top medical material manufacturers to bring you a surgical-grade tattoo applicator that will stain your skin perfectly every time.  
The inkbox consists of 4 layers:
1. The first layer is an adhesive stencil.
2. The second layer is a non-woven that contains our organic inkbox formula. 
3. The third layer protects your hands from getting stained. 
4. The fourth layer holds it all together, like a hug.  
When wet, the active inkbox formula is absorbed into your skin in the shape of the stencil.


The patent-pending inkbox formula is 100% organic and made from a fruit. It’s safe for your skin and safe for all ages. It works by reacting with organic compounds in your skin, effectively turning the structural proteins in the top layer of your skin black.
Unlike temporary tattoos that sit on top of your skin, ours sit in your skin, like a real tattoo. Tattoos stain the Dermis (the second layer of skin) and our formula stains the Epidermis (the first layer of skin). The reason tattoos stay forever is because the Dermis doesn’t exfoliate like the Epidermis.





We could have made our formula synthetic. But we took the hard road. We’re committed to building you a natural product that’s safe for your skin.


Just some of our 300+ designs!
 


Create Your Own Tattoos

*Not a functional prototype
The inkbox tattoo studio will allow you to easily create any tattoo you desire. You can upload your own designs or create one from scratch by tracing images, text, and shapes. You can then order it as a custom inkbox that we ship to you. Design to door! …to skin.

*Not a functional prototypeAnd if you're an artist, you’ll be able to sell these designs on our curated tattoo marketplace. 
We're aiming to release this in the Spring of 2016. 

Our vision
We want to give you a completely new way to express yourself. We’re committed to bringing you hundreds of new designs every month and a tool that allows you to easily create and wear your own tattoos.




It’s All About Self Expression
We can do some cool things with our inkbox tattoos, but we can’t replicate the full gamut of tattoo art. From shading to pointillism, there are certain things our tattoos cannot currently replicate (but we’re working on it!). Tattooing is an art form and we don’t wish to disrupt that, but rather, we wish to co-exist alongside it as a form of self-expression. 



Giving Back
We donate a percentage of every sale to the Darien Initiative, which for 30 years, has provided community and agricultural support to the Embera-Wounaan and Kuna tribes of the Darien Gap, Panama


These tribes have been dying their skin with the pulp of the Genipa Americana fruit for thousands of years. It’s where we got the idea for inkbox and it’s where the ingredients for our formula come from.


We also pay our wonderfully talented artists fair commission on each sale of their designs. 

Rewards
Every inkbox comes in a kit with a black tattoo glove and a towelette. For example, if you back reward 3 you will receive 3 full kits, packaged separately. 







Why us

Cofounders Tyler (left) & Braden (right) Handley
This is a product we both wanted in our lives. We're making inkbox as awesome as possible because we're our own biggest customers. We’ve been selling a previous type of fruit-based tattoo for 7 months now and we personally talk to many of our customers, listening closely to what they want to see. Their feedback, combined with our own desire for semi-permanent tattoos, is the reason we created the new inkbox tattoo.
Our story


As brothers we've always worked on things together.  As children we would ride our bikes around our hometown and purchase second-hand sporting equipment that we would then sell back to our local used sporting goods store for a profit. We're pretty sure we kept that place afloat for a few years as 10 and 13-year-olds.
When Tyler moved away for 4 years we lost contact.  2 years ago Tyler came back. When we came up with the concept for inkbox we decided to rekindle our brotherhood and work on something together again. Some say don't mix family and business, but for us it has always been closely intertwined. To us, business is about sharing the same values with each other and our customers.  inkbox is a family affair through and through. 








Shout-out
To all of the wonderful people who have helped us over the past 5 months.
Nigel, Chloe, Marianne, Kristine, Cynthia, Ashton, Sam, Mike, David, Matt, Felipe, Brodie, Ves, Shawn, Rob, the DMZ staff, and our parents.

<p><span>78% of companies have good strategies and plans, but only 4% focus and execute.  The other 74% are distracted and unfocused.  We have thousands of distractions during our

in the county in Virginia. Living in the country there was a lot to be done
outside. Yard work started to grow on me a bit but never thought of it as a
job. Going to school I was just learning what my goals and passions where in
life. After graduating high school I had many job while going to college and
every job I took didn't really make me happy or gave me the passion to go. I
worked in construction doing framing, worked at the post office, sold new and
used cars at a dealer, sold hats for lids, work now part-time at Lowes Home

business to make $600 for rent in May 2009. The passion and drive to learn more
about growing my small mowing business then turn to a lawn and landscaping
maintenance small business. I started the business in Bentonville, AR where it
became an established small business. The name I choose was Mower Man Lawn

Fast-forward to today, my mother-in-law has dementia so she needs constants
care so I moved my family and small business to San Diego, CA in June of 2013.
She is also a 5-time cancer survivor so she means a lot to me, too.  I
gave up my small business so my wife could take care of her mom. In the process
I gave up my dream job and picked up a part-time job at Lowes Home Improvement
while I could reestablish my small business. After being here for 2 years, I
have had trouble putting funds together to afford to market my small business
to my new customers. Things are very different here: There is a lot of competition,
we are in a drought still since I moved to San Diego, and it's a city not a
country setting like where I began my small business.</p>

my goal I would be able to get some door hangers, pay for gas to distribute
them, help get a website going, start advertising through social media, Get
some equipment and repair equipment that I currently have, and create art work
of my work that I want to see if I could start a new trend. I call it
landscaping art. This art/ photography could be sold on eBay or etsy haven't
decided yet.</p>
<p>       When I
moved here I had some money saved aside but that was used up with living
expenses and food. You may ask: Why don't you work to save up the money
yourself if you're so passionate about this business? Because I would be
so grateful if you could understand that making a small business is hard
work. It takes a lot of dedication and passion. This all started with an idea
that grew into something enjoyable to do everyday. A couple months back I was
asked what make me different from any other lawn-care company? Several things
make it different: my business was started from hard work and was not an
inheritance, I do quality work without taking any short cut that others may do,
I run and operate several social media accounts for the business by myself (my
passion can be seen through each social media account page), my dream is not to
be come rich from this line of work; it is to provide the best work that
customers want or need due to not being able to do it them selves because of
work or physical abilities. I want to thank everyone that takes the time to

<br/></div>","This is my second attempt to raise my goal with Indiegogo. In my first attempt that ended November 4, 2014. It inspire 1,600 referal that turn in to $481.00 from 11 contributions. The campaign page also had 2,900 visits! How amazing that was to reach that many people. Please take a few moment to read my small business cause and I hope you get inspire today to become a contributor towards my passion, thank you! Hi my name is David Ovando, I grew up
in the county in Virginia. Living in the country there was a lot to be done
outside. Yard work started to grow on me a bit but never thought of it as a
job. Going to school I was just learning what my goals and passions where in
life. After graduating high school I had many job while going to college and
every job I took didn't really make me happy or gave me the passion to go. I
worked in construction doing framing, worked at the post office, sold new and
used cars at a dealer, sold hats for lids, work now part-time at Lowes Home
Improvement. All those job were not landscaping or lawn-care! 
         
 In June of 2008 I got married to the love of my life and received the
news that I was going to be a dad. After the birth of my son I started a mowing
business to make $600 for rent in May 2009. The passion and drive to learn more
about growing my small mowing business then turn to a lawn and landscaping
maintenance small business. I started the business in Bentonville, AR where it
became an established small business. The name I choose was Mower Man Lawn
Service. My business grew to over 100 mowing job per month with 20-30
landscaping maintenance per month over the years and I got the experience and
knowledge by reading books and watching online videos. I came out in a local
news paper in Bella vista, Arkansas doing leaf removal, have also been featured
with Independent we stand (which is sponsored my Stihl and Chrysler) see it here: http://www.independentwestand.org/indie-thought... , and was
nominated to be small business of the year out of 250 business nation wide with
independent we stand in 2013 and again in 2014 out of 306 business that were
nominated (didn't win, but it was an honor). Here is the link to the nomination for 2014 : (http://www.independentwestand.org/indies/profil... ). Green industry pro, which is a

<p>These days, creative work doesn’t stop when the office closes. Great ideas and inspiration can happen anytime. Having an external display is the perfect way to get more done efficiently but it’s difficult to fully develop an idea on a small screen. Until now, most portable monitors were only 13” or 15.6” and lacked essentials such as touchscreen control. </p>

<p>We are a team of engineers who passionated about developing the production boosting tool to help people work more efficiently. A secondary monitor to expand your view is not a new thing today. Most of the portable monitor we found in the current market is either 13"" or 15.6"". A 17.3” monitor can rarely be found in the current market. After research, we found that most of 17.3"" monitors are too thick, bulky. And none of them are designed with the pressure-sensitive function and aren't compatible with the active stylus pen. We thought that could be a perfect feature on a 17.3"" large portable monitor and can fill the blank in the current portable monitor market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the early stage of Ananta, it was thick with only one port for the power supply and data transformation. For the second prototype of Ananta, we increase the number of ports for convenience. After many tests we did, we are able to compact Ananta to a thinner and lighter monitor.</p>

   Ultra-narrow Bezel 
Push your viewing experience to the limit with a narrow-bezel 17.3” screen. Whether you’re playing games or watching movies, you will always enjoy the full picture.
 

 
 

 
With Ananta, you can build up a 17.3"" laptop easily without a 17.3"" high-end laptop cost. It is more lightweight, portable and powerful than ever!
 

 
 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 


 


 
 

 
We are a team of engineers who passionated about developing the production boosting tool to help people work more efficiently. A secondary monitor to expand your view is not a new thing today. Most of the portable monitor we found in the current market is either 13"" or 15.6"". A 17.3” monitor can rarely be found in the current market. After research, we found that most of 17.3"" monitors are too thick, bulky. And none of them are designed with the pressure-sensitive function and aren't compatible with the active stylus pen. We thought that could be a perfect feature on a 17.3"" large portable monitor and can fill the blank in the current portable monitor market.
 
At the early stage of Ananta, it was thick with only one port for the power supply and data transformation. For the second prototype of Ananta, we increase the number of ports for convenience. After many tests we did, we are able to compact Ananta to a thinner and lighter monitor.
 

 
 
Please check the video below and you will see how Ananta structured and compact into such thinness.




 

 
 

 

After many tests of research, design and development we have successfully conquered the thin and portable 17.3"" monitor without built-in battery.
 

 
Let's take a look at our workshop and the production line. We're confident to ship the product in our promised timeline. Please don't worry.
 

 
Here is a demo unedited video about the surprising pressure-sensitive functions. Check how the pressure-sensitive stylus pen works on Ananta monitor. You can easily control the thickness of the lines, create subtle shading, and produce a wide range of artistic effects.

Experience the new pleasure of killing task!

 

 
Ready to make your own work life style?

 
Movers can seamlessly suit your need with customizable templates on both MoverPad and MoverBook.

 

We welcome your creation to our newly found template community. Snap your template and hashtag #movertemplate and we may make them downloadable on our website.
The two page philosophy
 
Mover is about denoising and focus. We believe only the important ones are worth your attention. So we have the two-page philosophy, only sheltering stuff and ideas in immediate time span. They all stay on top with a single flip.

“Aren’t you tired of flipping pages all the time?”

“What mover organizers do you have exactly?”
 Basically, movers can snap on any strong metal surface (whatever magnet can stick on). For better organizing and elegant usage, we also designed specialized organizer for movers.
Meet the MagDisc!

 

Tired of picking up memo and a messy workspace?

 
You can also snap hand written notes with Mover on a MagDisc.
Meet the MoverPad!

About the snapping part….. MoverPad is embedded with strong magnets to be snapped aside a computer screen for easy visualization after MagDisc installation.


No worries, it can also stand vertically and horizontally.

Slide in your own template guiding your day to day action or thinking.

Snap to the Fridge! 
 

 
 


 

Consistent improvement of the outlook.

 
The Movers' magnet strength test


The Bauhaus style and the Simplicious style. Yet, you can always create your own style.




We originally used paper, but something about the hand feeling is lacking. That is why we keep changing and the tool evolves to a brick form.

Look how awful the original design is. The press-and-standup design has been tested over and over again to ensure the smooth experience.

We even thought of using a whole metal container as the base of Mover. But it failed.

We have tested different plastics for the strength and flexibility. Salute to those who broke and failed :)

We have finalized our design and are ready to manufacture.
During the prototyping period, we have built a strong connection with our suppliers and excluded the bad ones.
We have done a lot of testing on prototype and tooling process to ensure the manufacturing and production process will be feasible and smooth.
For Indiegogo InDemand, since we have succeeded funding on Kickstarter, we will ship out any order on a monthly basis.
