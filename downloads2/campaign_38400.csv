Alongside Florina Tudose, we are organising a project called SEEDS FROM ELSEWHERE over the next two years. Young refugees and migrants are invited to grow edible produce, plants and flowers from their homelands to create an urban garden in Finsbury Park. Over time the garden will become a portrait of our group and the journeys that individuals have made to get to London. The project also functions as a refuge from day-to-day concerns and offers an alternative space to share stories and ups and downs amongst a diverse group of people.</p>
<p>They Are Here will work closely with various groups, including Furtherfield Gallery (based in Finsbury Park) and Migrants Organise (<a href=""http://www.migrantsorganise.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.migrantsorganise.org/</a>), a community organization in West London and a platform where refugees and migrants organise for power, dignity and justice,  to facilitate a series of fortnightly gatherings. Art collective They Are Here draw on 10 years of experience of socially engaged projects, working with various groups across the public realm. Florina has been working with young refugees and asylum seekers for the past 2 years, and she is a passionate gardener.</p>
<p>Our campaign aims to raise funds to establish the gardening project and to maintain it. To do this, we need to buy tools, equipment and seeds, plus materials for building a polyethene greenhouse to support more fragile plants. We would like to provide food and drink to those who come to our meetings, encouraging people to return and spread the word about the project. We would also like to construct a pizza clay oven in the garden to create a more social gathering point. Ultimately, we want to create a space to invite the wider Finsbury Park community in to see what we have been doing.</p>
<p>In a time of turmoil regarding the status of the UK in the European Union, in which negative narratives around migration and refugees are present, we want to do something positive that creates a space for dialogue and a support network for those who may be struggling to find a place in London.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This work will provide families with cooking stoves that are more efficient in combustion, which helps the area in a myriad of ways. By having a more complete combustion, stoves require less woody fuel, thus slowing deforestation and helping families save money. Women are able to support themselves through micro-businesses cooking tortillas. Children are able to go back to school, since they do not have to collect as much firewood.</p>
<p>Traditional stoves are over an open fire with little to no insulation and ventilation. Economic, social, and health issues are prominent due to poor stove construction. Last year I helped to supply five biomass cook stoves for residents, two of which were for domestic uses with the Joca-Justa stove model, and three for commercial use with the Emelda model. Both stoves utilize combustion chambers in a newer rocket elbow design. This design aids in air flow, distribution of heat, and wood size restriction. These stove models are overall designed to decrease wood fuel use by ~ 40% - 80%, reduce emissions by 98%, and increase family income by 25%.</p>

<p><strong><em>Greetings,</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Welcome to our site. We will be having two separate events to honor Winter Solstice. One ceremony will be held on the shores of Lake Tahoe to honor Cave Rock.  Tribal family members, elders and supporters that know the calling will attend and do the important work that is called for at this 10 Million year old ancient, sacred place.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The second event will be a Women's Gathering Honoring Grandmother Moon, The Universe and  the Sacred elements.  Both events, will take place December 19, 2012 – December 24, 2012 on the shores of Lake Tahoe, California/Nevada.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Winter Solstice is a time to Welcome Winter. Many people have forgotten to honor the changing of seasons.  We will gather to pray, sing, honor, dance, listen, make offerings and bring our gifts.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Women's Gathering allows the sacred feminine to work together and upon our Mother Earth.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>""Our shawls will so the next step on this journey of life.  She is grandmother, mother, aunt, daughter, wife, friend and blessed caretaker.  She is compassion, understanding, courage, love, peace, protector, transcendent, life giver.</em><em>” </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Donations to fundraising campaign will assist us in providing air transportation, food, gas, lodging, wood, car rentals and additional resource needs for ceremony at the shores of Lake Tahoe and Cave Rock, especially for the five elders who are seeking to attend Winter Solstice Ceremony.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>As a small grass roots organization, Preservation of Ancient Traditional Indigenous Lands (P.A.T.I.L.), and as representatives of Indigenous Nations, we were given the vision to care for our Mother Earth and Honor all the sacred life giving forces. We have worked together for 11 years. We are tribal members from several different nations and nurturing supporters. In a world where most things are rushed, we have taken time out to reflect and work towards our inner needs and ancestral calling. It is time to honor these ways that stem from the core of who we are and how we stand in this world.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We are seeking $5,000 donations due to an unforeseen cancellation of our Music Fest that was to be held on November 3rd 2012 at the War Memorial Building in San Francisco via phone call from the Trustee of the War Memorial Building and Post 448 on the 29<sup>th</sup> of October 2012. This LEFT US without a venue to hold our annual fundraising event. While we were in dismay and our hearts were on the ground, it is not by mistake that we find ourselves here on Indiegogo seeking your support. Your donation will help cover expenses for both events to bring elders to our Winter Solstice Ceremony and elders to the Women’s Gathering. The funding also assists us in the protection of Sacred Sites. Your donation will help us in providing the continued care of Cave Rock (Deek Wadap'ush) and other sacred sites. </em></strong><strong><em>There is much to do to bring the Deek Wadap’ush site back to its original natural state.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>P.A.T.I.L. supports traditional ceremonies and gatherings. Our mission is to support the necessary work for the sacred lands, waters, air and light. It is very important work to honor and celebrate the life giving sources. We look forward to expanding our wings and doing what we can to influence the future generations.  This is our first Great grand daughters campaign.  We are appealing and respectfully seek your generosity and extend our heartfelt thanks.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>We have wonderful perks, ie: Virtual Hugs, Speaking your name at Lake Tahoe,Thank you cards, photo cards, prints, hair cuts, massages, talking stick and original paintings. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The Impact:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>On the shores of Lake Tahoe, California and Nevada stands Cave Rock (Deek Wadap'ush) 10 million years old. Traditionally any person passing by spoke a prayer and left an offering in their honor.  In the 1930 rock climbing became popular at Cave Rock. Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California stepped forward to protect Cave Rock.  In less then 2 decades much has been accomplished. Lake Tahoe Basin Management Service signed a rendering decision that would provide immediate protection. On January 28, 2005 the Cave Rock case was heard in Reno, Nevada. Federal Judge Howard McKibben upheld the 2003 decision by Forest Service Management to protect Cave Rock. On February 27, 2008, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision to ban rock climbing.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> We are proud to express that in August 2009 372 pins and climbing apparatus were all removed.  Cave Rock now enjoys more respect and protection since its nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Winter Solstice Ceremony on the shores of Lake Tahoe and and Women's Gathering is not a public event. Participation is by registration only.  Please no radios, alcohol, and drugs.</em></strong></p>

""Our shawls will so the next step on this journey of life.  She is grandmother, mother, aunt, daughter, wife, friend and blessed caretaker.  She is compassion, understanding, courage, love, peace, protector, transcendent, life giver.” 
Donations to fundraising campaign will assist us in providing air transportation, food, gas, lodging, wood, car rentals and additional resource needs for ceremony at the shores of Lake Tahoe and Cave Rock, especially for the five elders who are seeking to attend Winter Solstice Ceremony.
As a small grass roots organization, Preservation of Ancient Traditional Indigenous Lands (P.A.T.I.L.), and as representatives of Indigenous Nations, we were given the vision to care for our Mother Earth and Honor all the sacred life giving forces. We have worked together for 11 years. We are tribal members from several different nations and nurturing supporters. In a world where most things are rushed, we have taken time out to reflect and work towards our inner needs and ancestral calling. It is time to honor these ways that stem from the core of who we are and how we stand in this world.
We are seeking $5,000 donations due to an unforeseen cancellation of our Music Fest that was to be held on November 3rd 2012 at the War Memorial Building in San Francisco via phone call from the Trustee of the War Memorial Building and Post 448 on the 29th of October 2012. This LEFT US without a venue to hold our annual fundraising event. While we were in dismay and our hearts were on the ground, it is not by mistake that we find ourselves here on Indiegogo seeking your support. Your donation will help cover expenses for both events to bring elders to our Winter Solstice Ceremony and elders to the Women’s Gathering. The funding also assists us in the protection of Sacred Sites. Your donation will help us in providing the continued care of Cave Rock (Deek Wadap'ush) and other sacred sites. There is much to do to bring the Deek Wadap’ush site back to its original natural state.
P.A.T.I.L. supports traditional ceremonies and gatherings. Our mission is to support the necessary work for the sacred lands, waters, air and light. It is very important work to honor and celebrate the life giving sources. We look forward to expanding our wings and doing what we can to influence the future generations.  This is our first Great grand daughters campaign.  We are appealing and respectfully seek your generosity and extend our heartfelt thanks.
Board Members: Alberta Moore Gabriel Snyder (Washoe), Holly Calica (Ilocano/Pangasinan), Mary Jean Robinson (Cherokee), Ismael Versoza (Filipino), Richie Beltran (Seneca/Azteca), Edgar Santiago (Taino/Puerto Rican/Salvadoran) and Debbie Santiago (Washoe/Osage)
Board Advisors: Barbara James Snyder (Washoe/Paiute)
We have wonderful perks, ie: Virtual Hugs, Speaking your name at Lake Tahoe,Thank you cards, photo cards, prints, hair cuts, massages, talking stick and original paintings. 
The Impact:
On the shores of Lake Tahoe, California and Nevada stands Cave Rock (Deek Wadap'ush) 10 million years old. Traditionally any person passing by spoke a prayer and left an offering in their honor.  In the 1930 rock climbing became popular at Cave Rock. Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California stepped forward to protect Cave Rock.  In less then 2 decades much has been accomplished. Lake Tahoe Basin Management Service signed a rendering decision that would provide immediate protection. On January 28, 2005 the Cave Rock case was heard in Reno, Nevada. Federal Judge Howard McKibben upheld the 2003 decision by Forest Service Management to protect Cave Rock. On February 27, 2008, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision to ban rock climbing.
 We are proud to express that in August 2009 372 pins and climbing apparatus were all removed.  Cave Rock now enjoys more respect and protection since its nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. 
Winter Solstice Ceremony on the shores of Lake Tahoe and and Women's Gathering is not a public event. Participation is by registration only.  Please no radios, alcohol, and drugs.
Please put out the word to everyone about this campaign. We remain strong and humble on this journey of life.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>HACER is interested in rehabilitating a community that has been negatively affected by the high number of foreclosures. This neighborhood is a victim of disrepair due to the high number of abandoned homes. It is for this reason that HACER has begun a campaign of adoption of Norma Elaine St in West Palm Beach, FL.</p>
<p>HACER has taken the first step in the adoption process by purchasing a four unit apartment building. These apartments have been completely remodeled with the assistance of volunteers and local contractors. Once remodeled, the units have been assigned to low-income families.</p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>According to the International Federation of the Red Cross, <strong>2 billion people </strong>have been affected by natural hazards over the last 10 years. Scientific data reveals that the large majority of these hazards are <strong>hydrological</strong> (e.g. floods, storm surges) and are magnified by the effects of <strong>climate change</strong>. The most affected regions have been the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America and the Caribbean, displacing about <strong>18 million people</strong>.</p>

<p>These disasters greatly impact <strong>water security for the poor </strong>(e.g. through water contamination or water shortages) and threaten people's livelihoods (i.e. their culture and means of survival). The international community's response, however, has been sparse or inadequate; while humanitarian organisations can be successful at delivering emergency aid, their short-term programmes often fail at addressing the <strong>root causes </strong>of people's vulnerability.</p>
<p>A number of scientific studies show that this is due to a chronic lack of participation of <strong>the affected communities </strong>in the design and implementation of development programmes.

<p>My name is Jasmine, and this year I am a senior in high school. I know I am just one person, but I am passionate about environmental conservation and I have decided to dedicate my one person to that cause by volunteering over 300 hours to marine and environmental conservation issues. I have developed the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/psweloveyou?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""P. S. We love You!"">P.S. We Love You</a> campaign to promote conservation of the Puget Sound, and I plan to pursue these interests in college where I’ll be studying marine biology and environmental sciences. My pursuit of research opportunities has helped me to discover this once in a lifetime volunteer opportunity studying Leatherback Sea Turtles in Trinidad y Tobago for twelve days.</p>
</div>

<h3>Why I Want To Go</h3>
<p>I didn’t make the decision to go to Trinidad and Tobago on a whim. My family’s contribution to this trip has replaced my Christmas present, my 18th birthday present, and my graduation present, and it’s completely worth it! This trip is a natural and exciting extension of the volunteer work I’ve been doing the last three years through the Seattle aquarium. This trip reflects my passions and my future ambitions perfectly.</p>

</div></div>","My Background Story

My name is Jasmine, and this year I am a senior in high school. I know I am just one person, but I am passionate about environmental conservation and I have decided to dedicate my one person to that cause by volunteering over 300 hours to marine and environmental conservation issues. I have developed the P.S. We Love You campaign to promote conservation of the Puget Sound, and I plan to pursue these interests in college where I’ll be studying marine biology and environmental sciences. My pursuit of research opportunities has helped me to discover this once in a lifetime volunteer opportunity studying Leatherback Sea Turtles in Trinidad y Tobago for twelve days.


Why I Want To Go
I didn’t make the decision to go to Trinidad and Tobago on a whim. My family’s contribution to this trip has replaced my Christmas present, my 18th birthday present, and my graduation present, and it’s completely worth it! This trip is a natural and exciting extension of the volunteer work I’ve been doing the last three years through the Seattle aquarium. This trip reflects my passions and my future ambitions perfectly.


... Leatherback Turtles? What I Am Going To Do With Them 
Yes, Leatherback Turtles. It is estimated that only one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings survive to adulthood. Eighty percent of all leatherback nesting occurs in the Caribbean, where the volunteer trip I’m pursuing takes place. On the trip I will participate in nightly beach patrols, looking for nesting adult female turtles and help researchers collect data and protect these delicate nests.

<h2><strong>Did you know there will be 3.5 million people experiencing homelessness again in America in 2012?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>You can help us help the homeless - One Bag At A Time!</strong></p>
<p>     My name is Krista, I live in the Austin, Texas area.  On a daily basis, one red light after another I have found myself curious of the stories behind those holding the signs on the street corners.  Even more though, I struggle with what I can do to assist.  I am not always comfortable handing over the loose change in my car.  Not because I am afraid, but more out of concern that I will be feeding a habit instead of a hungry belly.</p>
<p>     I then learned about this idea of filling ziplock bags with hygiene necessaties, water and a snack.  We then distribute them to the homeless on corners, in parks, under bridges and so on.  </p>
<p>     The bags we distribute contain:  Water, high protein bars, toothpase, toothbrush, soap, shampoo, washcloth, hand sanitizer or moist wraps, tissue packet, comb and socks.</p>
<p>     As we enter into the cooler months, we will adjust the bags to contain thermal underwear, gloves and hats and small blankets also.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>While we ask for donations of these products, we are still left with many supplies to purchase.  As the cooler months approach, there will be a much higher demand for additional supplies such as blankets and thermal wear.</p>
<p>With your monatary gift today, we will be able to purchase even more supplies to continue this project much quicker.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How Will Your Donation Impact The Community?</h3>
<p>At this point in time, we are strictly reliant on donation of products and helping with our money.  This limits the amount of bags we are able to put together and distribute.</p>
<p>The quicker we are able to generate donations, the faster we can assist the homeless - One Bag At A Time!</p>
</div>

<p>You can still help - tell everyone about us, encourage others to donate - Spread The Word!</p>

<p><strong>It´s time for a breakthrough in housing technology to become accessible to the most vulnerable communities in the world</strong></p>
<p>Due to climate change, floods are happening more frequently and with more devastating effects on communities worldwide. The current strategy to help vulnerable communities is to relocate them.</p>
<p>However, relocating these families breaks their connection to their income source (mostly agriculture and fishing), to their identity, and to each other. Moreover, this strategy is expensive and has largely failed, as families often return to their land seeking for a better quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>How can we help vulnerable communities living in flood prone areas without breaking their ties to income, identity, and support networks?</strong></p>
<p>By providing them with houses that can float when the water rises and return to the ground when it recedes. CO2 Bambu, a Nicaraguan social enterprise specialized in building ecological bamboo houses, has designed a low-cost amphibious house that can increase the life quality of millions of vulnerable people worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>What is an amphibious house?</strong></p>
<p>An amphibious house is one that sits on the ground the majority of the time, but which has the ability to rise up with rising waters during flooding events, and return to the ground when the waters recede.  This is done by securing the house to a buoyant platform, and connecting the house to vertical guideposts so that the house doesn’t float away. This technology already exists in the Netherlands and has been successfully deployed for over two decades.</p>
<p>These houses, however, can cost up to €300,000<em>, </em>making them an unrealistic option for hundreds of millions of the world´s most vulnerable people living in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Our challenge is to deliver amphibious houses at a price lower than $15,000.</p>
<p><strong>How does bamboo fit in to all of this?</strong></p>
<p>There is a relationship between the weight of the house and the cost of the below water buoyant system.  The lighter the house, the simpler the buoyant portion of the house.  Since bamboo is inherently light, it is the most promising building material to arrive at a low cost, flood resilient, bamboo amphibious house solution.</p>
<p><strong>How to contribute</strong></p>
<p>CO2 Bambu has engaged in dialogue with the community of Malacatoya, along with the world´s leaders in amphibious construction technology, and designed a solution.  Now we need to field our first prototype.  WE NEED TO DO THIS QUICKLY, BEFORE OCTOBER, WHEN THE WATERS OF THE MALACATOYA RIVER WILL RISE AGAIN.</p>
<p>We have received a donation for some of the materials by a US shelter manufacturer and CO2 Bambu can contribute the bamboo material required to build the above water home, but WE NEED YOUR HELP TO FUND:</p>
<p> -       The purchase of barrels</p>
<p>-       Construction and testing of the steel frame that will allow the amphibious house to sit on top of barrels in the dry season</p>
<p>-       Conduct testing with the national university of engineering to establish a testing protocol that will allow for the approval of this innovative construction</p>
<p>-       Deployment of the proof of concept amphibious house</p>
<p>We have come face to face with a broken paradigm in the global toolkit for post disaster response.  The current paradigm is to relocate populations to higher ground and yet there is ample empirical evidence that this solution does not work.  Populations return to their homelands.  We need to collectively come up with a flood-resilient solution that will allow vulnerable populations to adapt to Climate Change, but to do so in their homelands.  This is the promise of amphibious housing.</p>
<p>In the words of Martha Fernandez “<em>Si nos quieren ayudar, que nos ayuden aqui.</em>” (¨If you want to help us, then help us here”)</p>
<p>Join us in deploying the first amphibious house in Malacatoya.  It will be a technological breakthrough, one that will allow populations to adapt to their harsh and changing environment, and will do so without destroying the very fabric of the community.</p>

An amphibious house is one that sits on the ground the majority of the time, but which has the ability to rise up with rising waters during flooding events, and return to the ground when the waters recede.  This is done by securing the house to a buoyant platform, and connecting the house to vertical guideposts so that the house doesn’t float away. This technology already exists in the Netherlands and has been successfully deployed for over two decades.
These houses, however, can cost up to €300,000, making them an unrealistic option for hundreds of millions of the world´s most vulnerable people living in coastal areas.
Our challenge is to deliver amphibious houses at a price lower than $15,000.
How does bamboo fit in to all of this?
There is a relationship between the weight of the house and the cost of the below water buoyant system.  The lighter the house, the simpler the buoyant portion of the house.  Since bamboo is inherently light, it is the most promising building material to arrive at a low cost, flood resilient, bamboo amphibious house solution.
How to contribute
CO2 Bambu has engaged in dialogue with the community of Malacatoya, along with the world´s leaders in amphibious construction technology, and designed a solution.  Now we need to field our first prototype.  WE NEED TO DO THIS QUICKLY, BEFORE OCTOBER, WHEN THE WATERS OF THE MALACATOYA RIVER WILL RISE AGAIN.
We have received a donation for some of the materials by a US shelter manufacturer and CO2 Bambu can contribute the bamboo material required to build the above water home, but WE NEED YOUR HELP TO FUND:
 -       The purchase of barrels
-       Construction and testing of the steel frame that will allow the amphibious house to sit on top of barrels in the dry season
-       Conduct testing with the national university of engineering to establish a testing protocol that will allow for the approval of this innovative construction
-       Deployment of the proof of concept amphibious house
We have come face to face with a broken paradigm in the global toolkit for post disaster response.  The current paradigm is to relocate populations to higher ground and yet there is ample empirical evidence that this solution does not work.  Populations return to their homelands.  We need to collectively come up with a flood-resilient solution that will allow vulnerable populations to adapt to Climate Change, but to do so in their homelands.  This is the promise of amphibious housing.
In the words of Martha Fernandez “Si nos quieren ayudar, que nos ayuden aqui.” (¨If you want to help us, then help us here”)
Join us in deploying the first amphibious house in Malacatoya.  It will be a technological breakthrough, one that will allow populations to adapt to their harsh and changing environment, and will do so without destroying the very fabric of the community.

<b>Our
Campaign: Standing up to </b><b>Nestl</b><b>é’s water grab </b>
</h2>
<p><span>      Faced with </span>Nestlé’s plans
to export over 200 million gallons of bottled water a year from our
drought-stricken county in the Columbia River Gorge, a diverse coalition of
residents and tribal members from Hood River County, Oregon, have filed a
precedent-setting ballot measure to prohibit bottled water production in our
county. <b>Our goal at the Local Water
Alliance is simple</b>: <b>We want to
protect our  limited water resources that we need to support our families,
farms and salmon fishery</b>.<span>  Every community has the right to protect its most important resource: our water. No community should set a precedent of exporting water at the expense of its water security. </span></p>
<p><b><span>       Nestl</span></b><b>é’s misguided project
would send over 1.7 billion plastic water bottles out of the County each year</b>. Every drop of water Nestlé wants to use
is currently publicly owned by the State of Oregon or the City of Cascade
Locks, making Nestlé’s project the largest potential privatization of public water
for a bottled water project in Oregon history. </p>
<p><span>       We know Nestl</span>é and the water bottling industry is
prepared to spend whatever it takes to stop our measure and to prevent other
communities from following suit. Our ballot initiative will set a precedent that
communities all over the country could use to take control of their local water
security.</p>

<i>Cascade Locks residents have been fighting Nestlé's reckless water bottling plans for years and are laying the foundation for winning this precedent-setting measure.</i><br/><br/><p><b>Our drought is fresh in voters’ minds </b></p>
<p><span>       Hood River County was formally
declared in a state of drought emergency this summer and voters are well aware of the County's serious water troubles. If you drove down most
Hood River County streets this summer, you would have seen  dried up lawns,
trees and shrubs. Orchardists and farmers spent thousands of dollars
on high efficiency irrigation systems and irrigation flows were cut off early.
Toilets went unflushed.  Over 200,000
sockeye salmon died due to high river temperatures driven largely by record low
river flows from Columbia River tributaries.

<p><i>A critical source of Hood River County's water supply, Mount Hood's receding glaciers and record low snow pack presents a serious threat to water security.</i><br/></p>
<p><span>        Despite this severe drought, Nestlé
argues that the more than 200 million gallons a year it wants to ship out of
the county is not much. But this is a lot of water if you do not have water to
spare. It also does not include the
untold millions of gallons Nestlé could truck to its proposed plant from the
Hood River Valley and elsewhere, like it does for its other bottling
plants.  Nestlé, for example, trucks over
65 million gallons per year to its Denver, Colorado, plant from sources as far
as 120 miles away.<a href=""#_ftn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></a>  </span></p>

<br/><h3><b>Our campaign strategy for winning</b></h3>
<p><span>       Our campaign is a grassroots effort
defined by neighbors talking to neighbors and volunteers working one-on-one
with voters to highlight the risks water bottling poses to our water
security.  We have already raised more
than $10,000, won a legal fight against Hood River
County to qualify our measure for the ballot, opened a downtown campaign
office, and have more than 50 active volunteers working on the campaign. <b>This
is great progress, but we need more support to win this.</b> </span></p>
<p><span>       Our strategy is to thoughtfully
educate voters while being able to quickly respond to misleading political spin
from Nestl</span>é and other bottled water companies. We have supporters from across the political spectrum that
represent every part of the county and our goal is to use these supporters’ passion and experiences to educate and inspire those around
them. This type of intimate voter
contact is possible in a county with just over 11,400 voters, but we will also
use all the traditional campaign outreach measures and tools. <b>Our
goal is not merely to win the election, but to win with a super-majority of
support.<span>  </span></b>  </p>
<p><span>       While our campaign is homegrown, we also benefit from the
expertise and experience of organizations such as Food &amp; Water Watch, which
is helping communities around the country stand up to corporate water bottlers,
and the CRAG Law Center, which is representing the Local Water Alliance and
recently won our lawsuit against the County to help qualify our measure for the
ballot. These and many other allies, businesses and elected leaders have
already endorsed our ballot measure and taken a stand for the future of our
water security.</span></p>

that communities around the United States are fighting similar battles for
their water and appreciate all the advice and support we have received from
people and organizations around the county. </p>

We
hope you will join us in supporting this precedent-setting effort to ensure
local control of our water supply and our future.  <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448948223/r5miudw6nrbkupglio2d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Hood River County, Oregon, the first in the country to prohibit commercial water
bottling.  


Help give our community the
resources to stand up to Nestlé and other water bottling corporations in this David and Goliath fight.


Warm
 Springs tribal member Klairice Westley with Wanapum Fishing People 
Against Nestle in front of Oxbow Springs in Cascade Locks, Oregon, which
 Nestlé's project is targeting.
Our
Campaign: Standing up to Nestlé’s water grab 

      Faced with Nestlé’s plans
to export over 200 million gallons of bottled water a year from our
drought-stricken county in the Columbia River Gorge, a diverse coalition of
residents and tribal members from Hood River County, Oregon, have filed a
precedent-setting ballot measure to prohibit bottled water production in our
county. Our goal at the Local Water
Alliance is simple: We want to
protect our  limited water resources that we need to support our families,
farms and salmon fishery.  Every community has the right to protect its most important resource: our water. No community should set a precedent of exporting water at the expense of its water security. 
       Nestlé’s misguided project
would send over 1.7 billion plastic water bottles out of the County each year. Every drop of water Nestlé wants to use
is currently publicly owned by the State of Oregon or the City of Cascade
Locks, making Nestlé’s project the largest potential privatization of public water
for a bottled water project in Oregon history. 
       We know Nestlé and the water bottling industry is
prepared to spend whatever it takes to stop our measure and to prevent other
communities from following suit. Our ballot initiative will set a precedent that
communities all over the country could use to take control of their local water
security.
More information and the text of the measure is available at LocalWaterAlliance.org.
 
Volunteers at a ballot measure signature gathering kickoff event have a veryclear message.
Why do we need your financial support?

       Our David and Goliath campaign would stop plans for a
water bottling mega plant by one of the largest corporations in the world. While we have strong public backing, we need your financial support today so
we can do two big things:
  1)
Educate voters about the importance of this measure; and 
  2) Rebut Nestlé’s misleading political spin
about their plans to export over 1.7
billion plastic bottles of water a year out of our community that cannot
even meet our existing water needs.  
       With your help, we can mobilize our
grassroots campaign to stand up to Nestlé, which is already working to mislead
voters with empty promises and fear tactics. Your funding will help us: 

Recruit
     and train volunteers to connect with and educate voters
Produce
     and pay for buttons, lawn signs, and flyers
Register
     people to vote and turn out thousands of voters leading up to Election Day 2016
Run
     door-to-door neighborhood canvasses and phonebanks where our volunteer
     base will talk to voters one by one
Produce
     and pay for voter outreach that educates voters and rebuts Nestlé’s political spin
Pay for our
     campaign office space and supplies

Tribal members and residents join together to protest Nestlé's water grab at the Capitol in Salem, Oregon, in September, 2015.Help
Us Set a Precedent for Community Water Protection
       Communities around the country and
world are facing the threat of bottled water exports despite shrinking local
water supplies and widespread projections of  drought as
the new normal. Our grassroots campaign
has the potential to set a precedent for water security not only in Hood River
County, but for communities across Oregon and the country.  

Cascade Locks residents have been fighting Nestlé's reckless water bottling plans for years and are laying the foundation for winning this precedent-setting measure.Our drought is fresh in voters’ minds 
       Hood River County was formally
declared in a state of drought emergency this summer and voters are well aware of the County's serious water troubles. If you drove down most
Hood River County streets this summer, you would have seen  dried up lawns,
trees and shrubs. Orchardists and farmers spent thousands of dollars
on high efficiency irrigation systems and irrigation flows were cut off early.
Toilets went unflushed.  Over 200,000
sockeye salmon died due to high river temperatures driven largely by record low
river flows from Columbia River tributaries. 


A critical source of Hood River County's water supply, Mount Hood's receding glaciers and record low snow pack presents a serious threat to water security.
        Despite this severe drought, Nestlé
argues that the more than 200 million gallons a year it wants to ship out of
the county is not much. But this is a lot of water if you do not have water to
spare. It also does not include the
untold millions of gallons Nestlé could truck to its proposed plant from the
Hood River Valley and elsewhere, like it does for its other bottling
plants.  Nestlé, for example, trucks over
65 million gallons per year to its Denver, Colorado, plant from sources as far
as 120 miles away.[1]  
        Voters will not soon forget this
summer’s drought, especially since all predictions are that this type drought is
quickly becoming our new normal.


Our campaign strategy for winning
       Our campaign is a grassroots effort
defined by neighbors talking to neighbors and volunteers working one-on-one
with voters to highlight the risks water bottling poses to our water
security.  We have already raised more
than $10,000, won a legal fight against Hood River
County to qualify our measure for the ballot, opened a downtown campaign
office, and have more than 50 active volunteers working on the campaign. This
is great progress, but we need more support to win this. 
       Our strategy is to thoughtfully
educate voters while being able to quickly respond to misleading political spin
from Nestlé and other bottled water companies. We have supporters from across the political spectrum that
represent every part of the county and our goal is to use these supporters’ passion and experiences to educate and inspire those around
them. This type of intimate voter
contact is possible in a county with just over 11,400 voters, but we will also
use all the traditional campaign outreach measures and tools. Our
goal is not merely to win the election, but to win with a super-majority of
support.    
       While our campaign is homegrown, we also benefit from the
expertise and experience of organizations such as Food & Water Watch, which
is helping communities around the country stand up to corporate water bottlers,
and the CRAG Law Center, which is representing the Local Water Alliance and
recently won our lawsuit against the County to help qualify our measure for the
ballot. These and many other allies, businesses and elected leaders have
already endorsed our ballot measure and taken a stand for the future of our
water security.

About
Us
The
Local Water Alliance is made of up of Hood River County residents working to protect
our local water supply from bottled water operations. We are non-partisan
and believe people from all political parties can agree that Hood River
County's water resources should be used for residential and agricultural
uses. 
While
the Local Water Alliance is made up of Hood River County residents, we know
that communities around the United States are fighting similar battles for
their water and appreciate all the advice and support we have received from
people and organizations around the county. 

We
hope you will join us in supporting this precedent-setting effort to ensure
local control of our water supply and our future.

As an Ocean lover, SCUBA Diver and marine conservationist I wanted to see for myself what the impact, if any, a country with one of the World's densest populations, a large part of whom depend on the Ocean for their daily sustenance, was having on the regional marine life. What I found shocked me to the core.</p>
<p>I'm an Emmy winning underwater and wildlife cameraman. I have spent the most part of my working life, since leaving military service in 1994, in the pursuit of imagery to compliment International broadcast and production projects. During that time I have, and continue to, self produce short films predominantly with a conservation message linked to them. Three of these films to date have either won high profile International Film Festival awards or been selected as official entrants for other prestigious screenings. <br/></p>
<p>This particular project will help reinforce the message that we simply cannot keep taking for granted that which the Ocean provides. Local resources can only support local populations IF they are managed correctly. It is sad to state that throughout my filming all I could see was the drive by certain elements to take as much as they could from the local resources in order to supply International demand. In effect taking the food out of the mouths of the families of the men catching the commodity. <br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>What is Needed?<br/>
</h3> <p>All of the filming for the Indonesian side of things is now complete. I have run two Crowdfunding drives for this project to date, with a total budget requirement of US$75,000 I managed to raise a total of US$28,005 leaving a shortfall of <b>US$46,995.</b> With a current supporting of some 236 backers to date the underlying feeling is to push through with this final drive for the remainder of the shortfall. <br/></p>
<h3>Where will the Money be spent?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Whilst there is some sterling work being done by wonderful people in certain areas of Indonesia, and who feature in this film, it is sad to say that these entities are very much the minority. Very much in evidence throughout the archipelago is the feeling that every person is out for themselves with little, if any, regard for others or for the impact their actions may have on the local marine environment. Needless to say whilst there is some marine based tourism throughout Indonesia it is a tourism aspect which doesn't seem to figure in the daily lives of the majority of coastal living communities. For this reason I want to compare Indonesia with the Republic of Palau.<br/><br/>Very much seen as a leading light in the modern day Ocean conservation drives Palau was the first nation to declare its territorial waters a shark sanctuary back in September of 2009, it is also a place in which I lived for almost four years. A large part of the Palauan population is involved directly or indirectly with the burgeoning Ocean related tourism on which the local economy thrives. One of the major 'pulls' of Palau with the International SCUBA Diving fraternity is that it remains as one of the few remaining locations on Earth where one can interact with a wide diversity of Shark and other enigmatic marine species, such as manta Rays and Turtles, on an almost daily basis. <br/></p>
<p>In order to conclude this project I need to cover the costs for the following key eventualities;</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs for 2 weeks filming in Palau including Helicopter aerial sequences<br/>
</li>
<li>Final Documentary Soundtrack</li>
<li>Final 'look' or grading of the documentary</li>

<h3>What happens if I don't hit my funding Goal?</h3>Always the main aspect of crowdfunding. I have selected the option to receive the funds raised irrespective if I reach my goal or not. This is down simply to the fact that there is one more filming segment to complete and all the imagery required will be 'in the bag' so to speak. As a working cameraman I will then simply have to look at providing the shortfall in the budget from the income of other projects I work on. <br/><br/>Living and working from a camera is not easy but telling this story to show the world what is happening is a necessity, if not for me then for those who can see the damage that is being done and take steps to correct them, before it's too late. I may go over my deadlines for perk delivery or it may take longer than planned to piece this intricate web of stories together. All I can say is that this is a story and a message that needs to be seen, that will be seen.<br/><br/><h3>What happens if I go beyond the funding Goal?</h3>In a perfect World this project will resonate with enough people to push the raised funds beyond the amount I'm seeking. In that eventuality any excess funds will go towards my next planned project which will focus on the wildlife poaching crisis in Africa. <br/>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>With your help this film will generate enough media attention for the Indonesian authorities to take notice and enforce the national laws of the land, and waters. Many of the fish markets around the country have very clearly placed posters and signs which illustrate species, such as the Great Hammerheads in the above image and the Manta Ray below, to be off limits to fishermen. These signs tend not to last very long, whilst the killing continues. <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>SHARKS</b> - A much needed element in every healthy marine environment. Regulators of a healthy gene pool they guarantee, to an extent, the health of the local fish populations of the reefs they patrol. Indonesia is constantly seen as a global leader in Shark Fin exports to supply the Asian demand for shark fins for the supposed delicacy of sharks fin soup. Many supposedly protected species are documented in this film being landed openly at regional fish markets.</li>
<li>
<b>Manta Rays</b> - Nothing can describe the feeling of diving with these sentient beings. With the largest brain size to body mass ratio in the Oceans they truly are spectacular. It is therefore somewhat disturbing to see them increasingly targeted by fishermen for their gills which again figure in certain Asian Medicine recipes as supposed cures for a range of ills from curing Cancer to boosting Male virility. Manta Rays are supposed to be protected throughout Indonesia as of February of 2014. The still frame below was taken from filmed footage realized in August 2014.</li>

Trawlers with nets that can fit 13 Jumbo jets in them hoover up target and non target species from huge swathes of our Oceans on a daily basis. Sharks and other predator populations are in free fall, some species are estimated at being 90% decimated since the 1950's. Given this scarcity something has to give, and sadly again that signals the demise of yet another enigmatic marine inhabitant, Dolphins. <br/><br/>It has long been known that certain fishing communities around the World actively target cetaceans to use as bait for regional shark fisheries, Indonesia is no different.

<h3>To Summarize<br/>
</h3>
We are all connected to the Ocean, to the amazing calm it instills when we sit by it's shores, the invigorating rush of interacting with it for sports and leisure as well as offering us the chance to marvel at it's beauty below the waves. As a nation the Republic of Indonesia is home to some 280 million people, many of them impoverished and dependent on the Ocean for their daily sustenance. Imagine day in day out the requirement to feed even a conservative 40% of the population, that is still in excess of 100 million people per day eating one fish and a handful of rice. One hundred million fish per day at the minimum, is a huge debit to be expected from an already depleted resource. <br/><br/>This film is not about victimization. It is not intended to paint anyone in a bad light, it is mainly pointing out some facts, some cold hard facts. Unregulated fishing of key species such as sharks and Manta Rays from a local resource will end in that local resource collapsing. With no regulators, disease in fish populations will go unchecked, second tier predators move in and turn the food chain on it's head with disastrous results. <br/><br/>This film aims to highlight this and in turn offer an option for a country as diverse and naturally blessed as Indonesia a view into what could transpire of their laws were steadfastly enforced for the better of all citizens. And more so for the generations to come...<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431759826/ethvcrigz3xn42gojxus.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

One hundred million fish per day at the minimum, is a huge debit to be expected from an already depleted resource. This film is not about victimization. It is not intended to paint anyone in a bad light, it is mainly pointing out some facts, some cold hard facts. Unregulated fishing of key species such as sharks and Manta Rays from a local resource will end in that local resource collapsing. With no regulators, disease in fish populations will go unchecked, second tier predators move in and turn the food chain on it's head with disastrous results. This film aims to highlight this and in turn offer an option for a country as diverse and naturally blessed as Indonesia a view into what could transpire of their laws were steadfastly enforced for the better of all citizens. And more so for the generations to come...

<br/><h3>A strategic 3-part plan to save the river</h3>
<p>The ERI's defense of the Jondachi River represents a pioneering strategy for international river conservation, engaging local stakeholders and promoting a clear alternative for resource management by preserving the Jondachi as a wild and scenic, free-flowing ecological corridor between the Andes and the Amazon. </p>
<p>The ERI is calling on the international community to support the three complementary initiatives of our defense of the Jondachi River: </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4><b><h4>
<b>1. LEGAL DEFENSE: </b><b>Protecting the legal rights of the river </b>
</h4></b></h4>
<p>The Ecuadorian Rivers Institute has <a href=""http://ecuadorianrivers.org/opposition-to-the-hydroproject/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">opposed</a> hydroelectric development on the Jondachi River for over a decade. In 2012, the ERI presented a legal defense of the Jondachi in a renewed effort to stop the <i>La Merced de Jondachi </i>hydro project and keep the Jondachi flowing freely. The ERI's successful 2013 Indiegogo campaign brought in $5000 to fund the original Jondachi Legal Defense. (THANK YOU to everyone who supported us then!) </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Now, after more than two years of deliberation, the Ecuadorian government water authority has REJECTED the ERI's demand to cancel the water concession granted for the</span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> La Merced de Jondachi</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> hydro project without taking into consideration tourism and recreational use of the Jondachi River, the errors, omissions, and irregularities in the water concession process, or the recommendations of their own government-appointed expert who advised that the project should be completely re-conceived.  </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The ERI is now APPEALING this ruling in Ecuadorian court.</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are pursuing grant monies to cover the bulk of the legal fees but are calling on our international supporters to help us jumpstart the process. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">(As a side note: In 2008, in an inspiring political statement, Ecuador built into its national constitution an acknowledgement of the rights of nature - personified as </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">pachamama</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> in the indigenous Kichwa. In theory, the new law granted legal standing to natural entities such as rivers. The ERI is acting on behalf of the Jondachi River to be sure those ""rights"" are not disregarded.)</span></p>

<p>Last year, the international paddling community rallied together with our Ecuadorian counterparts in an unprecedented expression of impassioned solidarity to create the first-ever Jondachi Fest. </p>
<p><a href=""http://ecuadorianrivers.org/jondachi-fest/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jondachi Fest</a> is a grass-roots, volunteer-driven community river festival and whitewater kayak competition that aims to promote the free-flowing Jondachi River as an economically viable alternative to hydro. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Jondachi Fest celebration integrates local facilitation and international participation with whitewater recreation and competition. With Jondachi Fest, <b>the emphasis is on local involvement. </b></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In 2015, the first Jondachi Fest enjoyed an international media reach of over 100,000 people, while local Ecuadorian media coverage of the event and the issue focused the eyes </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">of the country on this tremendous resource. </span></p>

<h4><b><br/></b></h4>
<h4><b>Where your money will go:</b></h4>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>50% of the money we raise in this campaign will go toward the legal defense of the Jondachi. </b>The ERI needs financial support to continue fighting this dam. With this campaign, the ERI is raising crucial funds to APPEAL the landmark river case on the Jondachi and build grassroots vision and action towards appropriate watershed management and development in the Jondachi watershed. </li>
<li>
<b>The other 50% will go toward education and outreach (Jondachi Fest) and further socialization of the proposed Ecological Corridor. </b>The ERI needs funds to cover the costs of Jondachi Fest's event infrastructure, kayak safety and logistical support for the Upper Jondachi Race, and the foundation for the community river festival in Tena.</li>
</ul>
<b>
<h4><b>About our fundraising goal:</b></h4></b>
</div><div>According to the ancient ""science"" (and we use that term loosely) of numerology, repetition of the number 11 represents an awakening to opportunities, to idealism, to synchronicity; a chance to notice latent potential and recognize what is truly possible. (All that sounds great to us!) We are embracing this idea with a nod toward the unseen forces in the world. Our fundraising goal acknowledges the playful nature of the universe, and we are aiming for $11,111 by 11:11 pm on November 11. <i>Bring it, universe! Let's do this!<span><br/></span></i>

The ERI is calling on the international community to support the three complementary initiatives of our defense of the Jondachi River: 



1. LEGAL DEFENSE: Protecting the legal rights of the river 

The Ecuadorian Rivers Institute has opposed hydroelectric development on the Jondachi River for over a decade. In 2012, the ERI presented a legal defense of the Jondachi in a renewed effort to stop the La Merced de Jondachi hydro project and keep the Jondachi flowing freely. The ERI's successful 2013 Indiegogo campaign brought in $5000 to fund the original Jondachi Legal Defense. (THANK YOU to everyone who supported us then!) 
Now, after more than two years of deliberation, the Ecuadorian government water authority has REJECTED the ERI's demand to cancel the water concession granted for the La Merced de Jondachi hydro project without taking into consideration tourism and recreational use of the Jondachi River, the errors, omissions, and irregularities in the water concession process, or the recommendations of their own government-appointed expert who advised that the project should be completely re-conceived.  The ERI is now APPEALING this ruling in Ecuadorian court. We are pursuing grant monies to cover the bulk of the legal fees but are calling on our international supporters to help us jumpstart the process. 
(As a side note: In 2008, in an inspiring political statement, Ecuador built into its national constitution an acknowledgement of the rights of nature - personified as pachamama in the indigenous Kichwa. In theory, the new law granted legal standing to natural entities such as rivers. The ERI is acting on behalf of the Jondachi River to be sure those ""rights"" are not disregarded.)

2. EDUCATION & OUTREACH: An innovative model for watershed conservation  



Last year, the international paddling community rallied together with our Ecuadorian counterparts in an unprecedented expression of impassioned solidarity to create the first-ever Jondachi Fest. 
Jondachi Fest is a grass-roots, volunteer-driven community river festival and whitewater kayak competition that aims to promote the free-flowing Jondachi River as an economically viable alternative to hydro. The Jondachi Fest celebration integrates local facilitation and international participation with whitewater recreation and competition. With Jondachi Fest, the emphasis is on local involvement. 
In 2015, the first Jondachi Fest enjoyed an international media reach of over 100,000 people, while local Ecuadorian media coverage of the event and the issue focused the eyes of the country on this tremendous resource.

3. CONSERVATION: Groundbreaking pursuit of international wild and scenic river designation  

The ERI is actively pursuing the designation of the Jondachi-Hollin-Misahualli-Napo Ecological Corridor, the international equivalent of “wild and scenic river” protection — the first-ever endeavor of its kind in Ecuador. The ERI intends for the proposed Ecological Corridor to be included in the Ecuadorian government’s new strategic plan to make the country a major low-impact adventure tourism destination. The Ecological Corridor initiative is championed by the country's Ministerio del Deporte (Ministry of Sports) and the Ministerio del Turismo (Ministry of Tourism). If the precedent can be set for protection of the Jondachi under a new wild and scenic statute, the door will be open for future protection of other imperiled rivers in the Amazon Basin.

A call to the international community We need global support to continue fighting for this legendary and iconic river. If we can secure protected river designation for the Jondachi, a door will be opened for future conservation of threatened rivers within the Amazon Basin. 

Where your money will go:



50% of the money we raise in this campaign will go toward the legal defense of the Jondachi. The ERI needs financial support to continue fighting this dam. With this campaign, the ERI is raising crucial funds to APPEAL the landmark river case on the Jondachi and build grassroots vision and action towards appropriate watershed management and development in the Jondachi watershed. 

The other 50% will go toward education and outreach (Jondachi Fest) and further socialization of the proposed Ecological Corridor. The ERI needs funds to cover the costs of Jondachi Fest's event infrastructure, kayak safety and logistical support for the Upper Jondachi Race, and the foundation for the community river festival in Tena.


About our fundraising goal:
According to the ancient ""science"" (and we use that term loosely) of numerology, repetition of the number 11 represents an awakening to opportunities, to idealism, to synchronicity; a chance to notice latent potential and recognize what is truly possible. (All that sounds great to us!) We are embracing this idea with a nod toward the unseen forces in the world. Our fundraising goal acknowledges the playful nature of the universe, and we are aiming for $11,111 by 11:11 pm on November 11. Bring it, universe! Let's do this!

economia” ma anche come opportunità di “fare economia”, ricominciare a credere
che con un’agricoltura nuova, smart, intelligente e all’avanguardia per metodi
e gestione, si possano creare allo stesso tempo business e integrazione.ORTHO CULTURA interprets the need to look at agriculture not only as a means to ""live with no great expenses"" but also as an opportunity to ""economize"", by starting to believe that agriculture can be a way to create both business and integration through new, smart and innovative methods and a renowned management style.
Un’agricoltura 3.0 per approccio ed
atteggiamento, per questo giovane e alla portata di chiunque.Our purpose is to boost agriculture 3.0 characterized by a new approach and attitude, attractive for young people and affordable for everyone.La
soddisfazione di essere stati selezionati è stata chiaramente immensa, vista da
noi sia come incredibile opportunità di farci conoscere quali giovani
professionisti e come progettisti attenti al profondo valore e significato
sociale che l'architettura, nella sua accezione più ampia, deve avere e deve
riscoprire; sia come vanto ed orgoglio di essere gli unici abruzzesi a poter
esporre ""un’opera” all’interno di una manifestazione internazionale
strettamente connessa con EXPO 2015.The satisfaction of being selected as winners was clearly immense. To us this it as an incredible opportunity to emerge as young professionals and designers with a particular focus to the deep value and social role that architecture, in its broadest sense, must have and must rediscover nowadays; yet, we are extremely proud of being the only ones from our beautiful land Abruzzo to be able to expose at an international event of this relevance, closely connected with EXPO 2015.Il progetto è stato pensato come un'installazione di facile e veloce realizzazione in linea con lo spirito e le linee guida del concorso. Materiali sostenibili, ma soprattutto semilavorati, utilizzati secondo principi di UP-CYCLING e RE-CYCLING, di facile reperimento e comoda installazione. Il budget minimo di cui avremo bisogno per poter realizzare ed esporre la nostra opera è stato calcolato considerando il costo e/o il valore di questi materiali.The project was conceived as an installation of quick and easy implementation in line with the spirit and guidelines of the contest. Sustainable materials, but mostly semi-used ones in accordance with the principles of UP-CYCLING and RE-CYCLING, easy to find and to install. The minimum budget that we need to realize and expose our work has been calculated considering the cost and / or the value of these materials.
Una rilettura in chiave moderna dell'orto urbano, e della possibilità di fare dell'agricoltura un momento sociale, aggregante, nuovo luogo di relazione, incontro, scambio ed apprendimento.
A modern reinterpretation of the urban farm, and of the possibility of making agriculture a social activity, being at the same time aggregating and a place of relationship, meeting, exchange and mutual learning.




Un elemento flessibile
caratterizzato da una progettazione aperta che sottende la possibilità di
utilizzo a varia scala e su scenari profondamente diversi. Suggerisce un
approccio di condivisione e collaborazione proponendo una lettura mai univoca
dello spazio. 

A flexible element characterized by an open design that underlies the possibility of using different scales and deeply different scenarios. It suggests sharing and collaboration by offering a multilateral space reading that is never unique.

Tavolati in legno montati
ad incastro realizzano una griglia ortogonale statica che regola l’inserimento
degli elementi necessari alla coltivazione, vera parte dinamica. Pozzetti in
calcestruzzo trovano nuovo utilizzo tra le maglie del basamento dando vita a passerelle
distributive.Wooden planks interlocking constitute an orthogonal static grid that rules the inclusion of the necessary elements for cultivation, that represent the truly dynamic part. Concrete manholes find new use in the base meshes creating walkways distribution.L’installazione perimetrata da elementi verticali, leggeri e permeabili, idealizza pareti e narra uno spazio architettonico in cui elementi
classici del costruire vengono prestati all’orto che diviene, in tal modo,
urbano.
The installation bounded
by light and permeable vertical elements, idealizes walls and narrates an
architectural space where classic elements of the building are “lent” to the
garden that becomes, in this way, urban.

La volontà di veicolare il progetto partendo dalle nostre realtà, con la possibilità di estenderlo verso il bacino di utenza di molte associazioni no-profit che già operano con successo permettendo a famiglie intere di fare economia attraverso piccoli ma preziosissimi sforzi.
Our goal is to convey the project starting from our reality, with the possibility of extending it to the user base of many non-profit organizations that already operate successfully in this sector, allowing entire families to make savings through small but valuable efforts.
Una vocazione totalmente sociale che speriamo possa prendere il largo grazie a tutti voi!

Thus, Ortho Cultura
is 100% inspired by a social vocation and we truly hope that it will take off

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>my name is Zoltan, my fiancée is Alexandra. We are a couple of ""back to the land""-ers in Hungary. We will move this year from the capital city Budapest, to one of the most beautifull area of the hill-country of Zala.</p>
<p>We've just acquired a small piece of land near Nagykanizsa, Homokkomarom. The valley is slashed with small properties, on most they grow vine. In the vicinity there is a huge woodland with all its miracles and places to explore. <a href=""https://www.google.hu/search?q=dombs%C3%A1g&amp;hl=hu&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RZxaUfPWKMqqtAaWi4C4Bg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC0QsAQ&amp;biw=1858&amp;bih=990#hl=hu&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=zalai+dombs%C3%A1g&amp;oq=zalai+dombs%C3%A1g&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l2j0i24l8.16206.17013.0.17635.6.6.0.0.0.0.71.317.6.6.0...0.0...1c.1.8.img.KDP_RFQrqr0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.44697112,d.Yms&amp;fp=ba57bf67aff1bb33&amp;biw=1858&amp;bih=990"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Some photos via google."">Some photos via google.</a> <br/>Our property is oriented to the south-west, and gets a good sun in the whole year around (the avarage temperature is 11°C). It has a slope of cca. 10 meters. The annual rainfall is over 600mm, so rainwater harvesting is quite possibel.<br/>The farm has an old vine plantation, that must be replaced, a wild-grown locust forest, and some plughland unused for 5 years.</p>
<p>Our goal is to start a new life there, and if possible to create commun of dedicated people to sustainable living, to permaculture. <br/>We'll be creating an off-grid farm, with low imputs of money and high imputs of human efforts, talent and heart.<br/>After carefull assesment of the soil, the climate, and the externalities we will be planting native trees and plants from local sources, and we will be raising some small lifestock, and bees.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the first step, we have to stop speading locust further, and we have to cut a lot of long dead vine-stocks.  These cuttings then has to be shredded for mulch and for compost.<br/>We are triing to be the most low-impact, so we will be growing plants in no till gardenbeds. For that we will need a lot of mulch. The easiest way getting this much mulch is to use the resources in the vicinity of our farm. That meens we have to shred biomass for our self.</p>
<p>So we need a shredder, and because we don't have electricity, we need a petrol powered one (like MTD 465). These units costs about 800€, my wage for three months. We can't afford that in this year for there is the project of off-grid living: - 200W solar panels and batteries costs around the same; - house repairment also costs a lot; - bulid a shower, and composting loo, with greywater threatment and bins; - summer kitchen, and guest qouters, etc.</p>

Jane Goodall participating in the most recent release in June this year.</p>
<p>It’s time for us to ensure that all the
aviaries, old and new are maintained at an international standard. The breeding
Bali Starlings deserve to have their homes in tip-top condition. We frequently
have guests visit us, we provide a tour of the site, guests can assist with the
daily feeding of the birds, and lunch can be served right beside the

<h2><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h2>
<p><strong>My name is Jerry Wilson. I was born in McComb, Mississippi, and moved to California when I was 7 years old. During my childhood, I watched and sometimes helped my father make anything we needed out of wood. He had the simplest of tools but was able to make beautiful, useful things for his 3 sons and our mother. I still have a table in my hallway he made when he was 18 years old. </strong></p>
<p><strong> My career focus took me away from woodworking but I've always worked in manufacturing. At one time, I made winches for 12 meter racing yachts and had the privilege of working on equipment for the Intrepid, two-time Defender of the America's Cup in 1967 and 1970.</strong></p>
<p><strong> For 10 years, I owned a machine shop making all kinds of metal parts and equipment. I sold the machine shop to my partner and found a job in the medical industry where I designed and made equipment to manufacture small plastic lenses (intraocular lenses) that were implanted inside the human eye of cataract patients.

<h2>Why Bamboo?</h2>
<p><strong>In considering the benefits of an expanding bamboo industry globally there is much good to be said of it. From a forestry standpoint, bamboo can be grown with no added fertilizers, pesticides or irrigation and can sequester up to 70% more carbon per year than a hardwood forest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moso bamboo has an optimal five-year growth cycle and is selectively harvested by hand, eliminating heavy equipment that can impact habitat. Bamboo can be harvested without the need to replant, as it naturally regenerates annually. Due to a rhizome root structure, bamboo has the ability to hold loose soil in place, preventing erosion.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bamboo is a rapidly renewable and readily available alternative source of material for a wide range of applications. Uses and applications for bamboo are plentiful with new ones being discovered all the time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>From its humble origins as an inexpensive raw material for building or fabrication of simple structures, furniture, tools, baskets, artistic craft and food source, bamboo now finds itself used for flooring, plywood, veneers, bicycles, fabrics and additives for both food and cosmetics. This has created new jobs in forestry, manufacturing, innovation and design, science and technology.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Because Smith &amp; Fong has worked hand-in-hand with local farmers, processors and manufacturers for many years, we are able to understand the challenges and the opportunities of the bamboo industry in ways few people can.</strong></p>
<h2>Environment and Sustainability </h2>
<p><strong>From the beginning, Smith &amp; Fong has been dedicated to sustainability. We make our decisions based on quality and design as well as social and environmental considerations. We believe that profit is the byproduct --not the product-- of a job well done.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have worked hard to earn a reputation for integrity and consider the trust our customers place in us one of our greatest assets. We believe in the natural sustainability of bamboo forestry and the harvesting practices developed over centuries of experience. To validate the legitimacy of our forestry practices, we sought out the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) for their help in certifying our Moso bamboo forest in China. After a two-year process, we succeeded in becoming the first bamboo company to offer FSC-Pure certified bamboo flooring, plywood and veneer in the North American market.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As adhesive sciences improved and concern for indoor air quality grew, we became the first adapters of formaldehyde-free manufacturing in both the bamboo and palm industries. We confirmed our success with California Section 01350 testing, still the most stringent off-gas testing protocol available anywhere. In an effort to streamline our formaldehyde-free program, an interesting alternative appeared--soy-based, formaldehyde-free resins. To our knowledge there was only one other company worldwide that was using anything similar. We liked it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Over a three-year process we were successful in adapting the soy-based resin to our unique bamboo manufacturing process. This allowed us to become the first bamboo company to offer a soy-based, formaldehyde-free adhesive system, surpassing emission requirements and setting a new level for clean in the industry. In order to improve our processes and our products, we undergo independent auditing and hold certification with FSC, well-managed forestry, FloorScore, requiring 01350 off-gas testing as well as management and factory controls and ISO 14001, a world standard in environmental control protocols.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We also make every effort to recycle, reuse or use recycled materials in our packaging. Smith &amp; Fong is directly engaged in setting environmental company policy and goals.</strong></p>

My name is Jerry Wilson. I was born in McComb, Mississippi, and moved to California when I was 7 years old. During my childhood, I watched and sometimes helped my father make anything we needed out of wood. He had the simplest of tools but was able to make beautiful, useful things for his 3 sons and our mother. I still have a table in my hallway he made when he was 18 years old. 
 My career focus took me away from woodworking but I've always worked in manufacturing. At one time, I made winches for 12 meter racing yachts and had the privilege of working on equipment for the Intrepid, two-time Defender of the America's Cup in 1967 and 1970.
 For 10 years, I owned a machine shop making all kinds of metal parts and equipment. I sold the machine shop to my partner and found a job in the medical industry where I designed and made equipment to manufacture small plastic lenses (intraocular lenses) that were implanted inside the human eye of cataract patients. I worked in this field for the next 30 years. During this time I built 8 medical facilities for this product in 6 different countries.
 Now I have a wood shop that my father couldn't have dreamed of. Modern technology has changed the world including what is now possible in a wood shop. As a craftsmen working alone I have access to some amazing technology: computer numerical control (CNC) equipment, computer-aided drafting (CAD) and Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). The equipment I like to use most is my ShopBot 3D Router and my Epilog CO2 laser.
 CNC and CAD CAM is very efficient when it comes to making more than 1 part. I've found that the more you can make the more efficiency you can realize. I enjoy both the production of multiple pieces and making one of a kind items as well.
 Thank you!

About the shop
My shop space was built by the former owner as a place to park his work truck, so it's open to the environment on three sides. I have to cover the equipment to protect them. The other night I walked out to the shop and suprised a raccoon looking for something to eat. I'm hoping I reach my project goal so I can enclose my shop. The support of the Indiegogo community would be helpful and most appreciated.

Why Bamboo?
In considering the benefits of an expanding bamboo industry globally there is much good to be said of it. From a forestry standpoint, bamboo can be grown with no added fertilizers, pesticides or irrigation and can sequester up to 70% more carbon per year than a hardwood forest.
Moso bamboo has an optimal five-year growth cycle and is selectively harvested by hand, eliminating heavy equipment that can impact habitat. Bamboo can be harvested without the need to replant, as it naturally regenerates annually. Due to a rhizome root structure, bamboo has the ability to hold loose soil in place, preventing erosion.
Bamboo is a rapidly renewable and readily available alternative source of material for a wide range of applications. Uses and applications for bamboo are plentiful with new ones being discovered all the time.
From its humble origins as an inexpensive raw material for building or fabrication of simple structures, furniture, tools, baskets, artistic craft and food source, bamboo now finds itself used for flooring, plywood, veneers, bicycles, fabrics and additives for both food and cosmetics. This has created new jobs in forestry, manufacturing, innovation and design, science and technology.
Because Smith & Fong has worked hand-in-hand with local farmers, processors and manufacturers for many years, we are able to understand the challenges and the opportunities of the bamboo industry in ways few people can.
Environment and Sustainability 
From the beginning, Smith & Fong has been dedicated to sustainability. We make our decisions based on quality and design as well as social and environmental considerations. We believe that profit is the byproduct --not the product-- of a job well done.
We have worked hard to earn a reputation for integrity and consider the trust our customers place in us one of our greatest assets.

To validate the legitimacy of our forestry practices, we sought out the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) for their help in certifying our Moso bamboo forest in China.

‘slow, store and filter’ water at as many locations as possible. This requires all
land owners and policy makers to recognise in the first instance, that the enhanced loss of water from
their landscape is the major problem. Holding back water in landscapes is fundamental to
resilient and healthy systems better able to supply food, clean water and ease
flooding. A simple approach of holding back water back on land could help simplify
policy, be cost-effective, remove red tape and empower land owners and
communities to create the healthy landscapes they desire. </p><p><br/></p><div>

A johad like intervention to retain flood water in the UK

These two problems of drought and flooding can be solved using the same techniques of  “Holding Water”in the landscape– one solution to two
extreme problems facing humanity. This is why we are bringing Rajendra Singh over to the UK  to share his experiences with a view to helping the UK solve its flooding challenges in a way that benefits both the communities and the environment.

Brief description of our campaign 

 In this week in
November, Rajendra Singh has been invited to the UK to convene various meetings
around these two issues and their solutions. Through these meetings at
strategic places, we are seeking the active collaboration of farmers,
scientists, engineers, NGO’s, politicians, landowners, property developers and
other interested people from local communities.
Confirmed Program ( so far):

policy, be cost-effective, remove red tape and empower land owners and
communities to create the healthy landscapes they desire. 

River BEFORE restoration 


River AFTER restoration by building these small dams 'Johads', 12 years later

What we need     This visit is the first part of a co-ordinated approach which will link flood and drought prone areas around the world in order to share experience, skills, best-practice and methods with a view to effective water management that will benefit local communities, ecology and ensure global food security.


These community led water solutions are both empowering and necessary. They help the landscape, ecology and communities. We welcome your involvement and you will be welcome to visit any of our
     projects in the UK and in India.  This is a growing movement and we would really like to meet you if you have an interest in this area of drought and flood solutions.

Our  fundraising milestones on the way to the £7000 are

£1000 - will enable us to organise a visit to a UK success story where small dam interventions have successfully held back the water, prevented floods even during last winters torrential  rain. This is to raise awareness as well as spark excitement in the surrounding villages facing similar problems that low-cost local solutions are not only effective but also within their reach.
£3000 - This will also allow us to also organise an interactive symposium for young activists to meet with Rajendra Singh and hear his remarkable story which started at the age of 25  inspired by the ideals of Gandhi and a passion to bring life back to a  arid region in a remote part of Rajasthan, India.


£5000 - Will allow us to organise a presentation by Rajendra Singh in Westminster, London for prospective funders to pledge their support with funds and enable these catchment solution methods to be implemented globally through building more Johads and starting water schools.
£7000 - This will allow us to invite Maulik Sisodia, the implementation co-ordinator from India - who is responsible for the on-the ground actions and initiating future projects.  Coming here will enable him to interact with UK co-ordinators, sharing his practical experience of project implementation and help create opportunities for future collaborations with them.The Impact
The
project facilitates community-driven decentralised water management &
conservation. It encourages the disciplined use of natural resources, ensuring
sustainable water availability for humans and livestock, resulting in an
increase in agricultural and milk production. In turn this ensures food
security and restores an area’s ecology and afforestation, sequestering carbon,
increasing bio-diversity and strengthening its capacity to adapt to climate
change.

Over the last 28 years, we have revived 7 rivers in Rajasthan, India from being completely
     dry to flowing perennially! In the UK, a village that flooded 5
     times in 2 years, has been dry this last winter when every other village
     was flooded in that area. Please see our website for more information: www.theflowpartnership.org

<h3>                             PBS Video:  Silence Of The Bees</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>It's A Lot Like The X-Files:</h3>
<p><img alt=""Typical Bee in profile"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/444998/pictures/original/20120916154143-Bee3.jpg?1347835314"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;""/>Honey Bees are dying in their Billions all over the world and It isn't just the Bees, it's ALL of the species of pollinator insects.  We may be witnessing the onset of a true extinction level event. If the pollinators die out, so do we.</p>
<p>We will begin by deploying 200 completely New and healthy Bee Hives throughout the foothills of the Northern Arizona mountain ranges, in order to replenish the ""wild"" bee population. New technologies to trap and kill predatory mites, beetles and moths will be integrated into each new hive.</p>
<p>We will use the new, pathogen resistant Queen Bees from BeeWeaver Genetics along with Mite resistant Russian Bees to produce both primary and daughter colonies that have been bred to maximize their resistance to Varoa Mites and the viruses that attack and destroy Bee colonies. </p>
<p>We will also build a number of experimental hives that utilize wax cell foundations and starter feeders incorporating colloidal silver in an experimental attempt to deactivate viruses and bacterial pathogens within the hive and within the Bees that live in it.</p>
<p>Approximately 200 New Hives will be distributed to small family owned  farms and orchards throughout Northern Arizona in order to bolster their food production capacity and help to ensure the success of their food crops.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We'll keep on keepin on:</h3>
<p>Utilizing economies of scale (big single purchases) we can keep the single-hive deployment costs to approximately $500 a hive.</p>
<p>Should we exceed our funding goals, we will be able to instrument many of the new hives, collecting real-time data on the health, survival, population growth and honey production of each one.</p>
<p>That data will be sent to the ""Global Hive"" for distribution to the various Honey Bee Research and Genome Projects world wide.</p>
<p>If we fail to reach our goal, we will deploy as many new hives as our achieved level of funding allows.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Projected Impact Of The Bee Hive Project:</h3>
<p>I have a quirky tendency to be a bit too serious about these things at times but THE SITUATION IS ENTIRELY CRITICAL ... and if you think our duplicitous, power hungry, money grubbing politicians are going to tell us the Truth about it, you have another think comming.  Already, the people who stand to make or lose money on each end of the spectrum are attempting to obfuscate and confuse the issue in a battle of PR wars ... some claiming the problem is solved, some blaming the insecticide companies and others blaming the governments. They will all still be running around in circles while the population is starving in the streets.  All of this is taking place in much the same way as the criminal miss management of the financial and housing markets that have left millions of us without homes.</p>
<p>Governments don't solve problems ... People Do!!!</p>
<p>There are many things in our country and in our Government that none of us can do anything about right now ... But this isn't one of them.   If we do nothing and the pollinators die out, <strong>We</strong> will be starving along with our children and just about everyone else in only a few years.  In the mean time, the cost of fruits, vegetables, sugar, coffee and nearly everything else will rise exponentially.  It will cost as much to buy a pound of sugar as it currently costs to fill your gas tank .... And That's Not Bullshit.</p>
<p>If we <strong>Are</strong> successful we can make a really serious contribution toward:</p>
<p>1. The long term survival of a <strong>Legion</strong> of Pollinator insects.</p>
<p>2. The survival of healthy ""wild"" Bee populations.</p>

</div></div>","PBS Video:  Silence Of The Bees
 
It's A Lot Like The X-Files:
Honey Bees are dying in their Billions all over the world and It isn't just the Bees, it's ALL of the species of pollinator insects.  We may be witnessing the onset of a true extinction level event. If the pollinators die out, so do we.
We will begin by deploying 200 completely New and healthy Bee Hives throughout the foothills of the Northern Arizona mountain ranges, in order to replenish the ""wild"" bee population. New technologies to trap and kill predatory mites, beetles and moths will be integrated into each new hive.
We will use the new, pathogen resistant Queen Bees from BeeWeaver Genetics along with Mite resistant Russian Bees to produce both primary and daughter colonies that have been bred to maximize their resistance to Varoa Mites and the viruses that attack and destroy Bee colonies. 
We will also build a number of experimental hives that utilize wax cell foundations and starter feeders incorporating colloidal silver in an experimental attempt to deactivate viruses and bacterial pathogens within the hive and within the Bees that live in it.
Approximately 200 New Hives will be distributed to small family owned  farms and orchards throughout Northern Arizona in order to bolster their food production capacity and help to ensure the success of their food crops.


We'll keep on keepin on:
Utilizing economies of scale (big single purchases) we can keep the single-hive deployment costs to approximately $500 a hive.
Should we exceed our funding goals, we will be able to instrument many of the new hives, collecting real-time data on the health, survival, population growth and honey production of each one.
That data will be sent to the ""Global Hive"" for distribution to the various Honey Bee Research and Genome Projects world wide.
If we fail to reach our goal, we will deploy as many new hives as our achieved level of funding allows.


Projected Impact Of The Bee Hive Project:
I have a quirky tendency to be a bit too serious about these things at times but THE SITUATION IS ENTIRELY CRITICAL ... and if you think our duplicitous, power hungry, money grubbing politicians are going to tell us the Truth about it, you have another think comming.  Already, the people who stand to make or lose money on each end of the spectrum are attempting to obfuscate and confuse the issue in a battle of PR wars ... some claiming the problem is solved, some blaming the insecticide companies and others blaming the governments. They will all still be running around in circles while the population is starving in the streets.  All of this is taking place in much the same way as the criminal miss management of the financial and housing markets that have left millions of us without homes.
Governments don't solve problems ... People Do!!!
There are many things in our country and in our Government that none of us can do anything about right now ... But this isn't one of them.   If we do nothing and the pollinators die out, We will be starving along with our children and just about everyone else in only a few years.  In the mean time, the cost of fruits, vegetables, sugar, coffee and nearly everything else will rise exponentially.  It will cost as much to buy a pound of sugar as it currently costs to fill your gas tank .... And That's Not Bullshit.
If we Are successful we can make a really serious contribution toward:
1. The long term survival of a Legion of Pollinator insects.
2. The survival of healthy ""wild"" Bee populations.
3. The economic survival of family farms & orchards.
4. The successful continuation of our national food supply.
To say nothing of saving approximately 15,600 farms and the 32,000 jobs that would otherwise be lost in the collapse of our 26 million acre agricultural community. 


Other Ways You Can Help if you're Monitarily challenged:
Local contributions of related material and equipment would help a LOT.
We could certainly use another short flat bed truck and a couple of Sea containers.
A few Acres of land North of Phoenix for assembling and staging hives would put us a lot closer to the deployment areas.
Your ideas and suggestions would also be greatly appreciated.

<p>We’re asking for your help with a local campaign to convince
the Gates Foundation, and other institutions in Seattle, to divest from fossil
fuel companies, and invest in a better future for us all</p>
<p></p>
<h4><span><br/>The Campaign </span></h4>
<br/>Seattle is literally
a crossroads for the fossil fuel industry. Coal trains, oil trains, Shell’s
Arctic drilling fleet: They are all here – and we’ve been fighting them all. But
even here in progressive Seattle, <b>the corporate power of oil and coal companies
puts us at a disadvantage.</b><span><b> </b> <br/>
<br/>
We have the people power, but they have the money and political
power. </span>But can you imagine a
world where oil companies no longer have that power?<br/><br/>Well, what if we could take that away from them? 


<p><br/><b>What if individuals, companies, churches, pension funds, governments united to
say that most of our remaining fossil fuels need to stay in the ground.<span>  To say that this isn’t okay anymore: That we simply won’t
support companies that want to destroy the climate any longer.</span></b></p>
<p>Well, that is possible.
And it starts by saying we won’t invest in those companies, and we will not
profit from the damage they cause.</p>
<p>That’s the fossil
fuel divestment movement – launched right here in Seattle by Bill McKibben.  It’s <b>the fastest growing divestment movement
in history</b>, with some 400 social good institutions and over 700 individuals  representing a total of $1 trillion having already divested from fossil fuels. </p>
<p>And now – with the
United Nation’s climate talks coming up in Paris later this year – we want to
help take the divestment movement to the next level.  <b>We want to take Seattle’s activist energy to
ask the world’s largest, most influential foundation, the Gates Foundation, to divest from fossil
fuels.  </b></p>
<p>Imagine the signal
that it will send when powerful and influential people – people like Bill Gates
– reject fossil fuel companies.</p>
<p>And it’s not just the
Gates Foundation. <b>We’re going to build a coalition right here in Seattle of powerful
people and institutions ready to divest</b> – to send a message to the Gates
Foundation and the world, that we are ready for a different future, and
prepared to put our money where our values are.</p>
<p><b></b></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Students rally outside the University of Washington, Feb 2015. Two months later the University pledged to divest from coal. </p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>So here's the ask:</b></h4>
<br/>350 Seattle has

</div><p><br/></p></div>","We’re asking for your help with a local campaign to convince
the Gates Foundation, and other institutions in Seattle, to divest from fossil
fuel companies, and invest in a better future for us all

The Campaign 
Seattle is literally
a crossroads for the fossil fuel industry. Coal trains, oil trains, Shell’s
Arctic drilling fleet: They are all here – and we’ve been fighting them all. But
even here in progressive Seattle, the corporate power of oil and coal companies
puts us at a disadvantage.  

We have the people power, but they have the money and political
power. But can you imagine a
world where oil companies no longer have that power?Well, what if we could take that away from them? 


What if individuals, companies, churches, pension funds, governments united to
say that most of our remaining fossil fuels need to stay in the ground.  To say that this isn’t okay anymore: That we simply won’t
support companies that want to destroy the climate any longer.
Well, that is possible.
And it starts by saying we won’t invest in those companies, and we will not
profit from the damage they cause.
That’s the fossil
fuel divestment movement – launched right here in Seattle by Bill McKibben.  It’s the fastest growing divestment movement
in history, with some 400 social good institutions and over 700 individuals  representing a total of $1 trillion having already divested from fossil fuels. 
And now – with the
United Nation’s climate talks coming up in Paris later this year – we want to
help take the divestment movement to the next level.  We want to take Seattle’s activist energy to
ask the world’s largest, most influential foundation, the Gates Foundation, to divest from fossil
fuels.  
Imagine the signal
that it will send when powerful and influential people – people like Bill Gates
– reject fossil fuel companies.
And it’s not just the
Gates Foundation. We’re going to build a coalition right here in Seattle of powerful
people and institutions ready to divest – to send a message to the Gates
Foundation and the world, that we are ready for a different future, and
prepared to put our money where our values are.


Students rally outside the University of Washington, Feb 2015. Two months later the University pledged to divest from coal. 




So here's the ask:
350 Seattle has
already demonstrated ability, passion and media savvy with Kayaktivism against
Shell Oil, protests against oil trains, and rallies against coal. But we’ve
been doing it all on volunteer power alone.  With your help we can take
this campaign to the next level. With your contribution,
we can invest in more organizing, more coalition building, more media, more
outside expertise – all the tools required to build a successful campaign.
We love doing what we
do - we live for it.  Which is why your
support matters so much.  Every dollar
you give us leverages so much passion and energy from committed people. It’s an
awesome investment in the future you want to see.
We believe that local action can have global impact. That one person acting can
inspire others.  That we can take actions
in our community that can help create the world we believe in.
Join us. Not
everybody can organize, rally or protest, but with your help, we have tons of
people ready to mobilize!

<p>Hello, and thank you for visiting our page! My name is Jonathan and I'm a National Geographic Explorer and PhD candidate at James Cook University.  My frog rescue team is racing to save species from extinction.  We need your help to finish building the Honduras Amphibian Rescue &amp; Conservation Center to get this program hopping!</p>
<p>In Honduras, three species of endangered frogs in Cusuco National Park are slipping towards extinction caused by a deadly pathogen called amphibian chytrid fungus.  This pathogen is spreading around the world, but unfortunately the amazing amphibians of Honduras have received little conservation attention.  Now, the frogs need our help!</p>
<p>The three frogs we're racing to save are pictured below.  They are: 1) the Cusuco spike-thumb frog (Plectrohyla dasypus), 2) the Exquisite spike-thumb frog (Plectrohyla exquisita), and 3) the Mossy red-eyed frog (Duellmanohyla soralia).</p>

<p>Protecting these beautiful frogs is
important for many reasons. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frog tadpoles act as “river lawn mowers” and protect
     clean drinking water.  Many tadpoles eat algae and other plant
     material which keeps rivers clean, impacting hundreds of thousands of
     people living nearby.</li>
<li>Frogs can also help control the spread of human
     diseases transmitted by mosquitoes such as malaria, dengue, and Zika. The
     tadpoles of some frogs are carnivorous and kill mosquito eggs and larvae.
     Globally, hundreds of millions of people are infected by a mosquito borne
     illness each year resulting in over one million deaths.</li>
<li>Frogs are an important food source for many other
     animals.  A diversity of fish, birds, snakes, mammals, and insects
     prey upon frogs and would have a difficult time finding enough food to eat
     if they disappeared.</li>
<li>Amphibians are beautiful creatures that play a role in
     many cultures and help inspire children to become interested in protecting
     the natural world.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><h4><b>Rescue
Site: Cusuco National Park</b></h4>
<p>The three endangered species we're
working to protect live in Cusuco National Park, a breathtaking rainforest that
sits in the clouds on top of a mountain in Honduras. We have been working here
for nearly 10 years, studying these amazing animals in the wild.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465153327/My_rainforest_office_IG_shrunk_mtpuow.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 311.483px;height: 208px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465153357/Cusuco_Cloud_Forest_2_edited_shrunk_fdbc2l.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 295.477px;height: 208px;background-color: initial;""/></p><p></p><p>Cusuco National Park (Cusuco) is
located in the Merendon Mountains of northwestern Honduras.  Cusuco
harbors remarkable biodiversity and is ranked among the “top 100 most
irreplaceable sites” in the world from an analysis of over 173,000 protected
areas.  In Cusuco, there are 14 amphibian species listed as Endangered or
Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with five
also endemic to this one location.  For this reason, Cusuco is also
recognized as a site of global importance by the Alliance for Zero Extinction.
 </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>More broadly, Cusuco is part of the
“Meso-American biodiversity hotspot” and protects a variety of additional threatened
and endangered species, including Baird’s tapir (Tapirus bairdii), jaguar
(Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii),
jaguarondi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi), Geoffroy’s spider monkey (Ateles
geoffroyi), the Golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) and resplendent
quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno).  During our frog rescue project, we will
help raise global awareness about the need to protect this critically important
rainforest for all the incredible wildlife it supports.</span></p>
<p><b></b></p><b>
</b><p><b><span><br/></span></b></p><h4><b><span>How Will We Save The Frogs?</span></b></h4>
<p>To protect these frogs from
extinction, we recently started building the <a href=""http://www.frogrescue.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Honduras Amphibian Rescue &amp; Conservation Center (HARCC)</span></a> at
Lancetilla Botanical Gardens in Tela, Honduras.  When completed, HARCC
will become the headquarters for our long-term frog rescue program. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once fully operational, our frog
rescue activities will begin with a
""head-start"" program to keep these three endangered species
alive in the wild: we will collect large numbers of baby frogs from the
rainforest in Cusuco before they die from chytridiomycosis (the disease caused
by chytrid infection), transport them to our biosecure HARCC facility where we
can cure their chytrid infection, care for them in this safe environment until
they become strong healthy adults with better immune systems, and then
reintroduce these healthy adults back into the rainforest.  These adult
frogs have greater resistance to disease than their babies, so this head-start
approach aims to increase the number of adult frogs breeding in the wild and
producing offspring to help offset the high death rate of juveniles.  This
conservation method has previously been successful in assuring the survival of
a variety wildlife species, but has rarely been applied to help frogs combat
chytrid fungus in the wild. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We believe this method will
stabilize and hopefully increase frog populations in Cusuco and reduce the
likelihood of extinction.  By repeating this year after year, it will also
allow natural selection to continue searching for animals genetically resistant
to this disease, and eventually these frogs might be able to develop their own
immunity over time.  </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>At the same time as head-starting,
we will also operate a captive breeding program to protect populations for
reintroduction if sudden unpredictable extinction occurs (e.g from natural
disasters like forest fires or illegal habitat destruction, both of which
 we have already observed in Cusuco).</span></p>

Impact </b><br/></p>
<p>The conservation program developed
at HARCC will become an increasingly important global response model to help
combat amphibian extinction caused by chytrid fungus.  This pathogen
continues to spread uncontrolled around the world and chytrid-free habitats are
disappearing.  We need to explore potential solutions within this context,
and that's exactly what we're trying to accomplish by working to keep these
endangered frog species alive in the wild.  The conservation work
performed by HARCC will become the first in Honduras, and one of few in
the world, to reintroduce large numbers of adult amphibians back into their
original chytrid-positive habitat in a major attempt to prevent disease-driven
extinction of wild populations.</p>
<p><b></b></p><b>
</b><p><b><span><br/></span></b></p><h4><b><span>Risks &amp; Challenges</span></b></h4>
<p>To minimize risks involved with this
project, we previously invested several years of research and planning into
this effort to increase the likelihood of long-term success.  We now
possess a strong foundation of international partners, involving biologists,
amphibian care experts, and government authorities in the USA, Honduras, and
the UK. Click <a href=""http://www.frogrescue.com/the-people/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>HERE</span></a> to read more about the core HARCC team

<p>Every dollar counts! If we exceed
our fundraising goal, additional funds will go towards housing repair costs to
fix up an old building where local HARCC staff will live while running frog
rescue activities.  This building needs a lot of TLC, but is located in a
great spot--just 5 minutes down the road from the HARCC rescue facility.
 Additional funds will also be put towards our next big field survey to
measure current levels of amphibian pathogens in Cusuco.</p>
<p>Together with your help, we'll
finally have the resources we need to start fighting amphibian extinction in
Honduras!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465153673/katie_group_shot_bexmh6.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 528.994px;height: 352px;""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p></p><ul>

Help Save Frogs in Honduras!
Hello, and thank you for visiting our page! My name is Jonathan and I'm a National Geographic Explorer and PhD candidate at James Cook University.  My frog rescue team is racing to save species from extinction.  We need your help to finish building the Honduras Amphibian Rescue & Conservation Center to get this program hopping!
In Honduras, three species of endangered frogs in Cusuco National Park are slipping towards extinction caused by a deadly pathogen called amphibian chytrid fungus.  This pathogen is spreading around the world, but unfortunately the amazing amphibians of Honduras have received little conservation attention.  Now, the frogs need our help!
The three frogs we're racing to save are pictured below.  They are: 1) the Cusuco spike-thumb frog (Plectrohyla dasypus), 2) the Exquisite spike-thumb frog (Plectrohyla exquisita), and 3) the Mossy red-eyed frog (Duellmanohyla soralia).
  Why Save the Frogs?
Protecting these beautiful frogs is
important for many reasons. For example:

Frog tadpoles act as “river lawn mowers” and protect
     clean drinking water.  Many tadpoles eat algae and other plant
     material which keeps rivers clean, impacting hundreds of thousands of
     people living nearby.
Frogs can also help control the spread of human
     diseases transmitted by mosquitoes such as malaria, dengue, and Zika. The
     tadpoles of some frogs are carnivorous and kill mosquito eggs and larvae.
     Globally, hundreds of millions of people are infected by a mosquito borne
     illness each year resulting in over one million deaths.
Frogs are an important food source for many other
     animals.  A diversity of fish, birds, snakes, mammals, and insects
     prey upon frogs and would have a difficult time finding enough food to eat
     if they disappeared.
Amphibians are beautiful creatures that play a role in
     many cultures and help inspire children to become interested in protecting
     the natural world.


Rescue
Site: Cusuco National Park
The three endangered species we're
working to protect live in Cusuco National Park, a breathtaking rainforest that
sits in the clouds on top of a mountain in Honduras. We have been working here
for nearly 10 years, studying these amazing animals in the wild. Cusuco National Park (Cusuco) is
located in the Merendon Mountains of northwestern Honduras.  Cusuco
harbors remarkable biodiversity and is ranked among the “top 100 most
irreplaceable sites” in the world from an analysis of over 173,000 protected
areas.  In Cusuco, there are 14 amphibian species listed as Endangered or
Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with five
also endemic to this one location.  For this reason, Cusuco is also
recognized as a site of global importance by the Alliance for Zero Extinction.
 

More broadly, Cusuco is part of the
“Meso-American biodiversity hotspot” and protects a variety of additional threatened
and endangered species, including Baird’s tapir (Tapirus bairdii), jaguar
(Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii),
jaguarondi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi), Geoffroy’s spider monkey (Ateles
geoffroyi), the Golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) and resplendent
quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno).  During our frog rescue project, we will
help raise global awareness about the need to protect this critically important
rainforest for all the incredible wildlife it supports.

How Will We Save The Frogs?
To protect these frogs from
extinction, we recently started building the Honduras Amphibian Rescue & Conservation Center (HARCC) at
Lancetilla Botanical Gardens in Tela, Honduras.  When completed, HARCC
will become the headquarters for our long-term frog rescue program. 

Once fully operational, our frog
rescue activities will begin with a
""head-start"" program to keep these three endangered species
alive in the wild: we will collect large numbers of baby frogs from the
rainforest in Cusuco before they die from chytridiomycosis (the disease caused
by chytrid infection), transport them to our biosecure HARCC facility where we
can cure their chytrid infection, care for them in this safe environment until
they become strong healthy adults with better immune systems, and then
reintroduce these healthy adults back into the rainforest.  These adult
frogs have greater resistance to disease than their babies, so this head-start
approach aims to increase the number of adult frogs breeding in the wild and
producing offspring to help offset the high death rate of juveniles.  This
conservation method has previously been successful in assuring the survival of
a variety wildlife species, but has rarely been applied to help frogs combat
chytrid fungus in the wild. 

We believe this method will
stabilize and hopefully increase frog populations in Cusuco and reduce the
likelihood of extinction.  By repeating this year after year, it will also
allow natural selection to continue searching for animals genetically resistant
to this disease, and eventually these frogs might be able to develop their own
immunity over time.  

At the same time as head-starting,
we will also operate a captive breeding program to protect populations for
reintroduction if sudden unpredictable extinction occurs (e.g from natural
disasters like forest fires or illegal habitat destruction, both of which
 we have already observed in Cusuco).
  What
We Need 
We previously raised the funds
needed to begin constructing the HARCC rescue facility, but now we need your
help to finish the job!
Your contributions will go towards:

Frog life-support equipment (air conditioners, water
     pumps, water sterilizers, veterinary medicine, etc.) needed for our frog
     rescue laboratory
Construction of an insect rearing facility (to produce
     frog food)
Construction of a water tower (to produce frog-safe
     water)
Employment for HARCC staff 
Frog rescue activities (disease & population
     surveys in Cusuco)


Perks
for You! 
To show our appreciation for your
support, we have some nifty perks for you!  
Some of these include photographs of
the endangered species you're helping to save, beautiful hand-painted artwork,
and even a rainforest tour to see these amazing frogs in the wild!
***A perk for EVERYONE! Every
dollar counts and we truly appreciate each donation! If you make ANY
contribution to this campaign, we will publicly thank you on our website at www.FrogRescue.com when
this campaign is finished.  Please Note: We fully respect your privacy, so
if for any reason you do not want to be listed on our website, just send a
quick message to info@FrogRescue.com and we will be happy to oblige!***

The
Impact 
The conservation program developed
at HARCC will become an increasingly important global response model to help
combat amphibian extinction caused by chytrid fungus.  This pathogen
continues to spread uncontrolled around the world and chytrid-free habitats are
disappearing.  We need to explore potential solutions within this context,
and that's exactly what we're trying to accomplish by working to keep these
endangered frog species alive in the wild.  The conservation work
performed by HARCC will become the first in Honduras, and one of few in
the world, to reintroduce large numbers of adult amphibians back into their
original chytrid-positive habitat in a major attempt to prevent disease-driven
extinction of wild populations.

Risks & Challenges
To minimize risks involved with this
project, we previously invested several years of research and planning into
this effort to increase the likelihood of long-term success.  We now
possess a strong foundation of international partners, involving biologists,
amphibian care experts, and government authorities in the USA, Honduras, and
the UK. Click HERE to read more about the core HARCC team
members.  
Every dollar counts! If we exceed
our fundraising goal, additional funds will go towards housing repair costs to
fix up an old building where local HARCC staff will live while running frog
rescue activities.  This building needs a lot of TLC, but is located in a
great spot--just 5 minutes down the road from the HARCC rescue facility.
 Additional funds will also be put towards our next big field survey to
measure current levels of amphibian pathogens in Cusuco.
Together with your help, we'll
finally have the resources we need to start fighting amphibian extinction in
Honduras!Other Ways You Can Help

In other words, we'll build a new sustainable community powered by waste.For your donation, we offer some great perks which you can see to the right: construction tours, signed architectural plans, dinner with our Executive Director Chris Velasco, naming rights, and more!Our experiencePLACE specializes in creating partnerships between the public and private, and the for-profit and nonprofit worlds. We have a lot of experience in making complicated projects happen. This project is a major collaboration between these partners:Our most recent example a community in Ventura, California called WAV (Working Artists Ventura). We developed WAV hand-in-hand with the Ventura community to meet a serious need for affordable housing and artist space, and together, we created something that stands apart: the world’s first sustainable artist community. It’s a huge success, and thriving today. WAV is a vibrant, active community of engaged citizens, formerly homeless families, successful artists, and people of all income levels. The building itself is LEED certified, and includes solar power. It has transformed downtown Ventura. Here's a photo:We envision this new E-Generation project in St. Louis Park to feature all the best aspects of WAV, and be powered by clean, renewable energy.The ImpactWith your help, we will create something that has the potential to be a true game-changer. If you've never given to charity before, this is the one; to change the lives of hundreds, and to change the way communities view energy and waste (Save the Waste!). Imagine communities like this all over the world, designed and built to embrace everything that creates true community: affordable homes and live/work space, art and culture, local businessnes, easy transit access, a lessened dependence on cars, and on-site agriculture: all powered by clean, renewable energy derived from waste.Together, we can: 
Open E-Generation (Phase I) by May
Launch the first sustainable community powered by garbage
Set the stage for many more projects
Create a tax deduction for you

Create affordable homes for people, and lower government burden

<p>We are a group of University of Tennessee students running a fundraiser for the nonprofit organization Thrive Lonsdale. Thrive Lonsdale is a Christian afterschool, summer, and mentoring program for at-risk children in the Lonsdale area. Our goal is to raise one-thousand dollars for upgraded conditions to playground equipment for kids who reside in Lonsdale. In an area where kids are being tempted and affected by gang violence, drugs, and poverty at a very young age, a playground serves as a safe place/ escape for youth, thus by upgrading the playground one is directly affecting the well-being of these kids and the neighborhood as a whole. Raising funds for the after school program provides the kids with a supportive atmosphere where their spiritual, emotional, academic, and physical needs are met.</p>
<p>     The Christian based program provides Bible studies and small groups to help the kids grow in their faith. These kids come from various backgrounds where all their needs aren't met and they do not get the typical home life that most children do. The non-profit organization takes care of these kids in so many vital ways. Some examples of Thrive’s care for their kids are academic tutoring, emotional support, and even providing meals. With your help, we can provide what is needed for this organization and help change these kid’s lives. By donating you get the chance to make a positive impact on a kid’s life.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Food Shift is an East Bay, California based organization working to reduce wasted food and utilize the abundance of food in our communities to empower, nourish, and engage the community.  Our social enterprise, The Food Shift Kitchen, uses recovered food to employ people and feed the community nutritious food.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571270198/ng99omy83r6yykzrftyr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>After 3 years of piloting our social enterprise in a small shared kitchen, we’re raising $40,000 to move into a larger, centrally-located East Bay kitchen so we can enroll more apprentices in our job training program, recover more food, and expand Food Shift Catering.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why we need you!</h3>
<p>We have worked hard to generate revenue through our vegetarian catering company - securing contracts with health, youth, and housing programs and catering events and meal with big companies.  And yet we still depend on community donations.  People like you help us make this dream a reality.  Please join us!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Model and the Impact</h3>
<p>Climate collapse and social inequality are two of the most pressing realities of our time.  Food Shift's model addresses them both.  If food waste were a country, it would be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China and the U.S.  </p>
<p>Food Shift donates 80% of its recovered produce to community partners who feed food insecure populations.  And, we know that food alone won't solve hunger.  Food Shift goes beyond the broken charity model to  educate, empower, and uplift people using the power of food.</p>

</h1><p>(<a href=""http://www.nicoladaschio.com/ecomobileurope/)"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#2A2A2A"">www.nicoladaschio.com/ecomobileurope/)</font></a><br/></p><p></p><p>EcomobilEuropE is an initiative aiming to explore the current status of eco-mobility in different European countries and to raise awareness on its environmental, social and economic implications.<br/></p>
<p>to reach these goals I will visit different European cities and countries; I will interview and discuss with eco-mobility experts and policy makers, as well as with cyclists and lay-people; and I will observe and listen to mobility and eco-mobility habits, challenges and opportunities. Overall, I will travel 4500 kilometres around Europe by bike and by train.<br/></p>
<p>During the tour I will record, report and share what I see and what I hear (e.g. pictures, blog, Twitter, Facebook…). I will also compile a report to increase the understanding and raise awareness on the topic. The initiative is open to all ‘eco-mobiles’ who want to follow for few kilometres or on twitter, have a coffee or a drink, couch-surfing, or e-interaction.<br/></p><p></p><h1>The project: what it is about<br/>
</h1><h2>Ecomobility<br/>
</h2><p></p><p>Eco-mobility is runningbefore the wind. Vis-à-vis cities which are polluted and polluting, congested and chaotic, European urbanites and policy-makers increasingly look into eco-mobility solutions to improve the quality of life of individuals, communities and the planet.<br/></p>
<p>The concept of eco-mobility refers to a set of traditional and innovative ways of commuting implying a range of environmental, social and economic benefits. Moving toward eco-mobile cities means, for instance, reducing the carbon footprint and the PM content per kilometre travelled. It means moving toward cities where commutes are quick, affordable and pleasant. It means shaping cities and habits that make people really free to choose a way of moving around which is convenient for them and for their whole community.<br/></p>
<p>Throughout Europe and the world, people have adopted different practices, reflecting both the social and physical characteristics of cities. Yet, the road for eco-mobility to become mainstream is still long. As European environmentalist, passionate for cities and urban issues, I want to explore the status of eco-mobility in Europe and raise awareness on the opportunities it carries.<br/></p>
<p>Of course, eco-mobility has to be discovered by bike!<br/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><h2>a journey to explore it<br/>
</h2><h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;""><p>On May 1st  I will start the journey. By bike and by train I will visit different European cities to see and experience directly how far eco-mobility has gone. In each one of the cities I will meet policy makers, associations, businness, cyclisysts and students. I will ask them about the chalenges and the opportunities that they see in a more sustainable urban mobility. I will also take with me the messages that these people want to convey further.<br/></p>
<p>The objective is to show the future to people moving in and between cities: there are some many good stories that have improved the quality of life of people, communities and the planet and inspiration is what is needed to replicate them.  There are also some bad stories and big challenges that prevent people to be happy when they move around. From congestion, pollution, road accidents, bike theft: I want to understand why these problems are so difficoult to solve and I want to challenge policy makers with the strength of all the people that will join somehow the trip to find quickly effective solutions.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p></span></h3><h2>Partners and supporters<br/>
</h2><p></p><p>Hardcore eco-mobiles (i.e. individuals and institutions whose work, study or life is particularly connected to eco-mobility issues): This group of people includes professionals, researchers, cyclists, activists, international and local policy makers, bike-producers and retailers, eco-mobility consultants, bike-sharing experts, bus drivers, representatives of associations, bike-coffee managers, etc. … Possibilities to support include endorsing the initiative, being available for interview and discussion, supporting in-kind and in-cash the initiative, increasing the visibility to scale-up the awareness raising potential.<br/></p>
<p>Other eco-mobiles (i.e. those who are interested in eco-mobility and are curious to know and do more about the topic). This group of people virtually include all people who, for reasons related to work, study, love, fun, move around on the road. Everybody is welcome to join the initiative by following me by bike or by train for few kilometres, following my twitter and blog, sharing ideas, a meal or a couch, raising awareness with friends and colleagues on eco-mobility<br/></p>

</h1></span><h3>
</h3><p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Myself</span><span lang=""EN-GB"">: Nicola da Schio. In my study and in my work I have always been
focusing on the protection of the environment on one hand, and on cities and
urban governance on the other. I worked, among others, with UNEP - United
Nations Environment Programme - 
and with ICLEI - Local Government for Sustainability. I studied the
environmental performance of cities, and the governance of the urban commons. I
just came back from Addis Ababa where I was working; beforehand I lived in
Italy, Germany and France among other countries. As part of this initiative, I
will bike, observe, photograph, ask, write, share, etc. …</span><br/></p>
<h1>how can you help me to make it happen<br/>

</h2><p>You can follow me on twitter (@nicdas13),  on facebook (ecomobileurope), or on the bike!  This will help me especially when I meet policy makers.

(www.nicoladaschio.com/ecomobileurope/)EcomobilEuropE is an initiative aiming to explore the current status of eco-mobility in different European countries and to raise awareness on its environmental, social and economic implications.
to reach these goals I will visit different European cities and countries; I will interview and discuss with eco-mobility experts and policy makers, as well as with cyclists and lay-people; and I will observe and listen to mobility and eco-mobility habits, challenges and opportunities. Overall, I will travel 4500 kilometres around Europe by bike and by train.
During the tour I will record, report and share what I see and what I hear (e.g. pictures, blog, Twitter, Facebook…). I will also compile a report to increase the understanding and raise awareness on the topic. The initiative is open to all ‘eco-mobiles’ who want to follow for few kilometres or on twitter, have a coffee or a drink, couch-surfing, or e-interaction.The project: what it is about
Ecomobility
Eco-mobility is runningbefore the wind. Vis-à-vis cities which are polluted and polluting, congested and chaotic, European urbanites and policy-makers increasingly look into eco-mobility solutions to improve the quality of life of individuals, communities and the planet.
The concept of eco-mobility refers to a set of traditional and innovative ways of commuting implying a range of environmental, social and economic benefits. Moving toward eco-mobile cities means, for instance, reducing the carbon footprint and the PM content per kilometre travelled. It means moving toward cities where commutes are quick, affordable and pleasant. It means shaping cities and habits that make people really free to choose a way of moving around which is convenient for them and for their whole community.
Throughout Europe and the world, people have adopted different practices, reflecting both the social and physical characteristics of cities. Yet, the road for eco-mobility to become mainstream is still long. As European environmentalist, passionate for cities and urban issues, I want to explore the status of eco-mobility in Europe and raise awareness on the opportunities it carries.
Of course, eco-mobility has to be discovered by bike!a journey to explore it
On May 1st  I will start the journey. By bike and by train I will visit different European cities to see and experience directly how far eco-mobility has gone. In each one of the cities I will meet policy makers, associations, businness, cyclisysts and students. I will ask them about the chalenges and the opportunities that they see in a more sustainable urban mobility. I will also take with me the messages that these people want to convey further.
The objective is to show the future to people moving in and between cities: there are some many good stories that have improved the quality of life of people, communities and the planet and inspiration is what is needed to replicate them.  There are also some bad stories and big challenges that prevent people to be happy when they move around. From congestion, pollution, road accidents, bike theft: I want to understand why these problems are so difficoult to solve and I want to challenge policy makers with the strength of all the people that will join somehow the trip to find quickly effective solutions.
Partners and supporters
Hardcore eco-mobiles (i.e. individuals and institutions whose work, study or life is particularly connected to eco-mobility issues): This group of people includes professionals, researchers, cyclists, activists, international and local policy makers, bike-producers and retailers, eco-mobility consultants, bike-sharing experts, bus drivers, representatives of associations, bike-coffee managers, etc. … Possibilities to support include endorsing the initiative, being available for interview and discussion, supporting in-kind and in-cash the initiative, increasing the visibility to scale-up the awareness raising potential.
Other eco-mobiles (i.e. those who are interested in eco-mobility and are curious to know and do more about the topic). This group of people virtually include all people who, for reasons related to work, study, love, fun, move around on the road. Everybody is welcome to join the initiative by following me by bike or by train for few kilometres, following my twitter and blog, sharing ideas, a meal or a couch, raising awareness with friends and colleagues on eco-mobility
Who am I 

Myself: Nicola da Schio. In my study and in my work I have always been
focusing on the protection of the environment on one hand, and on cities and
urban governance on the other. I worked, among others, with UNEP - United
Nations Environment Programme - 
and with ICLEI - Local Government for Sustainability. I studied the
environmental performance of cities, and the governance of the urban commons. I
just came back from Addis Ababa where I was working; beforehand I lived in
Italy, Germany and France among other countries. As part of this initiative, I
will bike, observe, photograph, ask, write, share, etc. …
how can you help me to make it happen
As you can immagine, this campaign needs your support too. With you it can become something much more important  and achieve a bigger impact to make our cities more liveable  and our planet happier.There are different ways you can help, and,  yes!,  there are very good reasons to chose anyone of them.#follow me:
You can follow me on twitter (@nicdas13),  on facebook (ecomobileurope), or on the bike!  This will help me especially when I meet policy makers. I will show them that there is a lot of us who want to be happy on the move!in exchange: I promise I will share very god stories, pctures and songs about EcomobilEuropE. You will also have all the details of your possible future holiday!#donate or host
This campaign requires passion, training, but also some money or  in kind contribution. I need it mainly to buy bike equipment, or to replace it. I need it for my fuel (food!!) and for the few train tickets I will buy.  I count on the hositality of people along the trip: if you don't have a credit card, but a big couch or an extra chair around your dinner table this is also very welcome (see http://www.nicoladaschio.com/ecomobileurope/ecomobileurope-the-itinerary/ ).in exchange: check out the 'perks' part. I have a bunch of nice little things for those who can help. From pictures of the trip, to the bike itself I am using!#share your stories
During the campaign I will share pictures and stories of what I see. You can send me your stories too: I will share them with those who are with me (virtually or physically).in exchange: some visibility for your stories, some more firends or fans who want to replicate it, some recognition!the project in detail

The Impact

  This project combines several important things.  Renewable energy
usage in a remote place, saving a historically valuable medieval castle and
create a particular place where people can heal and spiritually renew themselves
in a unique environment never experienced before. There are so many ancient
ruins falling apart. There is usually no money for
reconstruction. With this project we can make an example of how to
save and operate those structures for the benefit of history and
communities. I believe that the best way to preserve an ancient domain is
by continuing to use it.

Where your Money Will
Go:                              
Once the campaign is over, I'll secure all gift items and
copies of the books, and have them delivered to you. In the interim, I’ll use
the remainder of the money to help launch the organization. The money ( and any extra) will act
as seed funding, allowing all the pieces to fall into place for the
organization and proper design of the first project. At this point I can attract
funding from larger organizations that can help scale it up and eventually
become self-sufficient.
The cost breaks down are as follows:        Stipend for local workers: $500Start up operational costs and legal obligations : $3000Travel and Logistics: $1, 500 ( I'm happy to share that a  consulting firm dedicated to serving the food industry through science will be reducing our cost by collaborating with our local agriculture officers. Thank you Dr. Norei!!)Overhead: $500Total: $5,500                                                   The Impact- Our
work has two different kinds of impact. First, our process will prioritize
effective resource management methods, livelihood improvement strategies, and a
customized and culturally friendly sustainability certification process. 
                    Second, at SBLP Ghana, we believe that knowing each other on
a cultural level creates a sense of unity and understanding. Therefore, we use
a culturally friendly approach to learn about local business operational
processes, and also teach ways to customize and adapt them to globally accepted
ones. We believe that when we know more about and respect each others resources; the world is a safer, peaceful and beautiful place.
The Next Steps-This indiegogo project is only the beginning of what we plan to create. Our goal is
to initiate a series of innovative poverty alleviation and sustainable economic
alternatives which will harness the conscientiousness of individuals and
businesses concerned with ensuring responsible supply chain operations and
sourcing from Africa. 
Other Ways You Can Help- If you are not able to contribute financially, we appreciate every tweet, every post, and every action that increases awareness. You can use the brilliant indiegogo widgets or just mention it in passing to friends, family, and colleagues.",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What is a cob oven?</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">A cob oven is an <strong>outdoor, dome-shaped oven</strong>. They are constructed predominantly out of clay, sand, straw, and water. These earthen ovens can be used to make bread, pizza, and really anything else that can be baked. Not only do cob ovens produce delicious and healthy food, but they also are beneficial towards environmental sustainability, are inexpensive and fairly easy to construct, and can become strong community building hubs.</span></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What makes a cob oven sustainable?</h3>
<p>Most of the building supplies can be <strong>locally sourced</strong>, so as to limit the amount of fuel/emissions used in transport. In addition, cob ovens are wood-fired. This means <strong>no electricity or gas</strong> is needed. Because of the locally sourced, unprocessed materials, cob ovens have little impact on their surrounding environments. For example, when it rains, no chemicals will leach into the surrounding soil because all materials are natural and local. In addition, the unique shapes of the cob oven make it so it <strong>uses heat efficiently</strong>. This means it takes a small amount of wood to fire the oven. Therefore the environmental benefits outweigh the drawbacks of burning wood. Cob ovens are able to cook large amounts of food with <strong>minimal fuel</strong>.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Construction Process</h3>
<p>The construction process will take approximately four weeks before the oven will be operational. There will be only four full days of hands on work. These will be <strong>long, fun, and muddy summer days</strong>! During construction, the layers of cob will need to dry completely in order to proceed to the next step, so that's why the whole process will take around four weeks.  <strong>Additional students are invited to join in and help. </strong>After construction, the oven will last for approximately four years before needing any minor repairs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How else can you help?</h3>
<p>-<strong>If you would like to help with the construction</strong>, please contact me! I would love to have lots of helping hands/feet (you mix cob with with your feet!). <strong>The more the merrier</strong>. I will be building the oven over the summer.

<p>Building the sheltering roof</p>
<p>Digging a drainage trench- Measure a 58” diameter circle. Dig out the circle below the frost line (four feet deep). *Dig a drainage trench to reach daylight. Line this trench with gravel.*</p>
<p>Building the foundation- Build 36” foundation by dry stacking stones around the hole.  Fill the center with broken bricks and other scrap materials.</p>
<p>Insulating the  hearth- Mix up some cob by combining 2 parts sand, 1 part clay, and some straw on a tarp with feet. Add water to get the correct texture. Layer cob onto the filled hole and level to create an even and flat surface. Build a 4” cob wall surrounding the surface.</p>
<p>Building a firebrick hearth- lay out a thin bed of sifted sand for the firebricks. Line up and center four bricks for the door support on the edge of the hearth.  Place the rest of the fire bricks to cover the surface for the hearth with no space in between each brick.</p>
<p>Building a doorway template- The door opening will be 10” high and 13.5” wide. Cut out a plywood doorway template based on these dimensions. Trace the shape onto another piece of plywood and cut this piece out. Set the two cut out plywood pieces 8” apart and connect with two layers of cardboard to create a tunnel.  Set it up on the firebrick hearth on top of the 1” shim sticks on either side of the opening.</p>
<p>Making a cob arch- Mix up a sticky batch of cob to make the arch. To mix cob, use 2 parts sand, 1 part clay, some straw,  and water. Lay out a tarp and combine with feet until the mixture is cohesive. Layer it onto the arch evenly and in multiple layers.</p>
<p>Installing the chimney- Position the stove pipe in the center of the arch at least 1-2” from the dome side of the doorway opening. Use a level to make sure the pipe is level.</p>
<p>Making a sand form- Wet the sand down enough that it will stick together and is easily sculpted. Draw a 27” diameter circle on the firebrick hearth. Load sand onto the bricks. Shape the sand into a dome. The shape should be similar to that of an egg cut in half.  The peak of the dome should be about ⅓ in from the back of the dome. Mark 16” on a stick and insert into the place that will become the peak of the dome. Once the sand has reached that height, stop adding sand. Tear up pieces of newspaper, wet them, and lay them across the sand dome.</p>
<p>Building a cob dome- Make more cob. Gently layer the cob around the perimeter of the dome.  Build up the dome evenly. The cob should be equally thick across the dome. Let the cob dry for 1-2 days. Once the cob is firm, remove the doorway template and scoop the sand out.</p>
<p>Insulating with straw-clay mixture- Once the cob has fully dried mix straw and a chocolate milk consistency clay slip. Mix a large amount of this insulation. Pack the insulation onto the dome in thick layers.</p>
<p>Preparing the oven for “plaster”- Immediately after insulating the oven, apply a yogurt consistency clay slip to cover the entire straw insulation.</p>
<p>Applying the base coat of plaster- Immediately following the previous step,  apply the base coat of plaster. The plaster is a watery cob mix. Apply the mixture ½” thickness over the entire dome.</p>
<p>Applying finishing plaster- Mix sifted sand with screened clay on a clean tarp. Add in fresh screened cow manure, wheat waste and the fluff of 3-4 cattails.  Spread ¼” of plaster across the surface of the dome. Smooth with a plaster trowel, or insert colored glass to make a mosaic design on the oven.</p>

<h3>Building Leadership and Success within the Michigan LCV Education Fund </h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Erica Bloom, and I am the Program Manager for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters Education Fund. In my role as Program Manager I work with a diverse array of environmental and conservation organizations across the state to advance our priority issues in the state legislature and administration. </p>
<p>I've started this fundraising campaign to raise $2,500 for the Education Fund's programs, specifically the ones I manage. As part of my own professional development  I am participating in the <a href=""www.elp.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.elpnet.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.elpnet.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Environmental Leadership Program </a> to become  a National Fellow. This program will allow me to become a more skillful, thoughtful and strategic Program Manager and environmental leader in my career. The money raised will go toward this Fellowship program and is considered an investment in me and therefore the Education Fund's programming. </p>
<p>Here's a bit more about the MLCV Education Fund--</p>
<p>The<a href=""http://www.michiganlcvedfund.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Michigan League of Conservation Voters Education Fund</a> is a 501(c3) organization that works in tandem with the Michigan League of Conservation Voters.  The Education Fund's mission is to provide voters and policy makers with the information and tools to protect Michigan's threatened natural resources. The Education Fund partners with members of Michigan's environmental and conservation community to determine legislative priorities in order to increase the salience of environmental issues in the legislative and administrative debate. </p>
<p>Below is our Cycle of Accountability which illustrates how the organizations work together. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/79857/files/20130917105544-MLCV_family_of_orgs_2012.jpg?1379440544"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The main program I run within the MLCV Education Fund is called <a href=""www.greatmichigan.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""www.greatmichigan.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.greatmichigan.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Great Michigan"" </a> and has a number of goals. The first is to convene the environmental and conservation community to determine a common agenda or, simply put, a short list of environmental issues and policy recommendations that state lawmakers consider the community's top priorities. These priorities become the main issues that MLCV Education Fund concentrates on for the legislative session (this year the issues relate to clean energy, public lands and water protection). </p>
<p>Convening over 30 other groups to identify and collectively support priorities requires skillful relationship building and strategic decision making. The National Environmental Fellowship is a series of two retreats which train environmental leaders to negotiate and lead diverse coalitions. Participating in this Fellowship will only enhance my ability to facilitate this sort of coalition or any others like it. <br/></p>

Hello, my name is Erica Bloom, and I am the Program Manager for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters Education Fund. In my role as Program Manager I work with a diverse array of environmental and conservation organizations across the state to advance our priority issues in the state legislature and administration. 
I've started this fundraising campaign to raise $2,500 for the Education Fund's programs, specifically the ones I manage. As part of my own professional development  I am participating in the Environmental Leadership Program  to become  a National Fellow. This program will allow me to become a more skillful, thoughtful and strategic Program Manager and environmental leader in my career. The money raised will go toward this Fellowship program and is considered an investment in me and therefore the Education Fund's programming. 
Here's a bit more about the MLCV Education Fund--
The Michigan League of Conservation Voters Education Fund is a 501(c3) organization that works in tandem with the Michigan League of Conservation Voters.  The Education Fund's mission is to provide voters and policy makers with the information and tools to protect Michigan's threatened natural resources. The Education Fund partners with members of Michigan's environmental and conservation community to determine legislative priorities in order to increase the salience of environmental issues in the legislative and administrative debate. 
Below is our Cycle of Accountability which illustrates how the organizations work together. 


The main program I run within the MLCV Education Fund is called ""Great Michigan""  and has a number of goals. The first is to convene the environmental and conservation community to determine a common agenda or, simply put, a short list of environmental issues and policy recommendations that state lawmakers consider the community's top priorities. These priorities become the main issues that MLCV Education Fund concentrates on for the legislative session (this year the issues relate to clean energy, public lands and water protection). 
Convening over 30 other groups to identify and collectively support priorities requires skillful relationship building and strategic decision making. The National Environmental Fellowship is a series of two retreats which train environmental leaders to negotiate and lead diverse coalitions. Participating in this Fellowship will only enhance my ability to facilitate this sort of coalition or any others like it. 
Environmental and Conservation Organizations convene in Lansing for the ""Great Michigan"" Priority Setting Meeting 

A second component of the ""Great Michigan"" program is to build the capacity of our environmental partners to advocate for the priority issues.  Through relationships made during the priority setting process, I am able to partner with the organizations and engage them in the state legislative process. For example, I organized a ""Great Michigan"" Legislative Education Day at the State Capital where many groups attended and discussed our priorities with their Representatives and Senators. 

In addition, I continually mobilize groups to meet with their legislators in their own communities through in-district coffee hours, I organize in-district Town Hall meetings, foster collaboration between our partner organizations, send out regular e-newsletters on priority issue progress, and, alongside my co-workers, hold webinar workshops on volunteer engagement, messaging strategies, and working with non-traditional allies. All these activities start to add up to a more informed, better organized and stronger environmental movement in Michigan.

  
 Our programs mobalize partner groups to meet with their State Representatives. Above, Anglers of AuSable board members meet with Rep. Rendon for in-district coffee hours to discuss fracking.

<p>My name is <b>Jarred Johnson</b>, and I'm currently fundraising for <b>""Power Shift"" </b>as campus lead recruiter at <b>University of Alabama at Birmingham </b>(UAB). My goal is to raise money to cover student's registration fees, and well as cover part of costs for travel expenses. I'm also currently interim president of environmental club ""<b>Green Initiative</b>,"" so this is an excellent way to get students plugged into a huge movement, and have them ready and excited about coming back to their community in <b>Birmingham, AL </b>to make change in environmental issues and social justice issues.</p>
<p>The city of Birmingham is a heavily polluted area, and it also happens to be a ""food desert."" The pollution problems arise from heavy traffic, dust from industrial and construction sites, and smog from steel production. The food desert problem means that Birmingham is an area where fresh and organic food isn't readily and abundantly available for Birmingham citizens, and affects the food that students receive throughout the school system, from elementary school to colleges. The<b> Magic City Agriculture Project </b>(MCAP) is working to provide organic food for Birmingham, and already has an expanding program with members like myself. In this program, organic food workshops and farm-grown food are available, allowing people to purchase clean and <b>GMO </b>(Genetically Modified Organism) free food (<a href=""http://www.southernfoodways.org/sustainable-south-magic-city-agriculture-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.southernfoodways.org/sustainable-south-magic-city-agriculture-project/</a>). This replaces food that causes birth defects, cancer, and other GMO food related illnesses (<a href=""http://responsibletechnology.org/health-risks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://responsibletechnology.org/health-risks</a>). </p>
<p>Where does <b>Green Initiative </b>come into the big picture? We are a organization on UAB's campus, seeking to educate young individuals on environmental justice, social justice, and help create leaders that will not only spread their knowledge, but advocate the drive to clean up Birmingham's pollution and related issues ( a brief look at Green Initiative is available here <a href=""http://www.uab.edu/news/uab-magazine/item/2929-green-lantern-a-student-voice-for-sustainability"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.uab.edu/news/uab-magazine/item/2929-green-lantern-a-student-voice-for-sustainability</a>). I've been involved with environmental justice since 2012 at <b>Mississippi State University </b>with SSC (Students for Sustainable Campus), and have met some of the most inspirational people I could ever hope to meet. Among these people, there are people that are striving to be psychologists, engineers, biologists, and other fields. My point? The major doesn't make the person, nor their beliefs. Environmental justice is extremely important, as the earth continues to deteriorate and be exploited for it's natural resources. Greed, corruption, and pollution are just the tip of the ice-burg (no pun intended). I've attended several workshops since then, and realized that I can make a difference, especially as an environmental issues. However, I find it very important to not be the engineer that only looks at pay, and is perfectly complacent with a decent paycheck and no community involvement.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>On August 3rd, 2016 Libertad Urban Farm was burglarized and vandalized by one Rico Valdez. After being caught red handed by bat wielding Founder and Executive Director, Tanys Fields he was arrested and charged with Petty Larceny. </p>
<p>Rico took all of our shovels, our rakes and hoes, two fully functioning wheelbarrows, knocked over our shed and effectively decimated it. He took eggplants and the Asian pears off the tree, he trampled and destroyed dozens of not yet ready to harvest onions. He got away with three tents, our large garbage pail, a set of 100 drill bits, 4 large folding tables, a large barrel charcoal grill, a 4 foot long cooler and a large gas pail. Amazingly, he was allowed to leave after his arraignment and a week late community members observed him burglarizing the space AGAIN! This time he took the few materials we had replaced. </p>
<p>The dilapidated gate and destroyed shed have made Libertad Urban Farm an easy mark and in order to continue to do our work and provide the community with a much needed green community space we must get these things remedied. The literal future of our projects depend on it. This burglary has already set back our Buying Club a month. Libertad Urban Farm since it's inception two years ago after a six year community led campaign has hosted events that encourage civic engagement and discourse, grown hundreds of pounds of food and hosted  food education curbside popups on the South Bronx Mobile Market Bus. It has proven itself to be a much needed resource in the community and one Bad Apple (no pun intended) and poor secutity conditions shouldn't keep us from ending the season with a bang and planning an even more successful season next year and beyond. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help us bypass much of the city bureaucracy  that has kept us from having a gate in functional condition including the inclusion of a retaining wall and getting a more appropriate heavy duty shed!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need at least 7500 bucks and here's for what:</p>
<ol>
<li>Min. 3k to work with NYC Parks Dept's Greenthumb to get a retaining wall and have them install an 8 foot gate. They have been amazingly responsive and understand the need an urgency but budgeting constraints and overwhelming need from other community gardens limits their response time and how quickly this can happen. We needed a gate 2 years ago. 3K can get us a retaining wall and a gate in a few weeks!</li>
<li>$2.5k for materials for a new shed. Eva Lucien a Union Member master builder has volunteered to come in with a team of kick butt student builders and build us a heavy duty, outdoor metal shed if we provide her with the materials. If we raise past our goal they'll even throw in a greenhouse! Whoop whoop!</li>
<li>1.2K will go towards wireless remote security cameras and motion sensor lights to deter wiuld be thieves who seek to steal from the community to keep their tookus' out of LUF and give us the ability to see what is happening in the garden in real time and institute some community policing protocols. </li>
<li>The leftovers will go to support programming like our cooking demos, workdays, intern stipends and movie nights. </li>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have turned a 20 year old lot into an open green space that welcomes community involvement and is led by the needs of the residents</li>
<li>We have hosted intergenerational work days, affirmed the humanity and worth of mothers, in particular Black low-income mothers, our model and methodology has emphasized self-sufficiency and economic inclusion over altruism and charity.</li>

Lake Ontario Waterkeeper is a registered charity working to ensure your water is clean and wild enough to swim, drink, and fish. Water should be free from pollution - and if it’s not, the people dunking, dipping, and diving have a right to know.




The Plan

So here’s our plan. The Waterkeeper team will bring our boat, Angus Bruce, to Toronto this summer.  We will sample the 25 most popular recreation zones on the waterfront. And you will finally know if water quality in our beautiful harbour meets government standards.
The Problem


But we need your help. Our boat, Angus needs a few repairs - the main one is a new roof to keep out the rain, so we can sample when pollution is at its worst. Then we need money for gas and lab testing. If you can help us raise $5000, we can get Angus to Toronto to test the waters. 


There are 9 combined sewage outfalls in the Toronto Harbour. And there are two wastewater treatment plants that also bypass sewage into the lake. However, 97% of Toronto's waterfront is not monitored -  100% of the Toronto Harbour is not monitored. No government monitoring means that there is no water quality information. Compare this with the fact that Toronto has one of the busiest recreational harbours in North America. People are swimming, paddling, sailing and boating in the water without knowing the quality of the water. This is a huge problem - and because of this lack of information, this summer 36,000 Ontarian's will develop a rash or become ill after swimming in polluted water.

Impact
With our sampling we will finally know if the water in Toronto's harbour meets government standards. 


Water sampling won’t solve Toronto’s sewage and stormwater pollution problem for good, but it will ensure people can safely enjoy Toronto's waters in the meantime.
Risks & Challenges
Some water quality information is better than no water quality information. While we hope to achieve our full goal of $5000 to accomplish our full set of testing - if we don't reach our full goal we still commit to conducting water quality testing in the Toronto Harbour's most threatened sites. But, the more we raise, the more testing we can do and the clearer picture we'll have of Toronto's water quality.

we need to buy new computers because ours are quite old and had tough life during university exams!
we need to improve our web site (www.streetitalia.it),
we must pay all the trips we need to meet and work together (Skype is cool but not enough)
we need to go to updating conferences about urban planning and arboriculture
and obviously we need a little bit of advertising for sTreet project.
Did you know you can gauge the country’s wealth, by its tree cover?! Think about it, won't you prefer greener cities, trees to watch, to lie under, instead of grey concrete or ANOTHER building??

If (unfortunately) we won't reach the goal we will use the money we managed to get to cover smaller costs (web site, some job trips) in order to continue searching for partners interested in our project. People who believed in us will obviously receive their marvelous perks! 

PERKS
Every single person can contribute to help us making sTreet real, because even a few dollars can make the difference.
THANK YOU so much for your support!

The Impact
We really think this project is worth trying! With our software everyone will tell which kind of trees goes in that specific area. It's something technical but even social. People need trees, but someone don't even know yet! It could be a method to learn more about trees too! Not everybody knows how useful urban trees are: they improve health, save energy, clean the air, reduce temperatures, and counteract our polluting lifestyles!

We are already working on sTreet software, to make planting easier, but we need funds to make it usable and concrete!


HOW WILL IT WORK? The planner simply inputs the necessary information, and sTREEt suggests the tree unit that best fits the available space. It will speed up and simplify the technical aspects of urban upgrade. This tree unit includes species, number of trees, distances and everything you'll need to plant your tree without worries.


STREET will help improve the quality of air and life. The benefits it will bring to the environment, the people and the buyers will be tangible and verifiable.Just think of all the small (but even big) empty spaces in our towns, or in our gardens:
 
 
Thanks to sTreet, planting we'll get really simple! STreet will give you all the information for a urban project containing as many trees as possible. Urban renowal can be fast and simple if you know how to do it!
Everyone can simulate (and then realize!) a recovery in the empty space he identified.
Street means to shorten the time for urban design.
 
 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
 
If you really can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help us! Talk about sTreet, make noise, let other people know about our idea! Use any share tool you can!

My name is
Magdalena Angel, and currently I am a student at Quest University
Canada, located in Squamish BC. In 2009, I went to the Great Bear
Rainforest for the first time with the Ecology class from Quest
University. During this experience, our group stayed in Hartley Bay
with the Gitgaâ€™at First Nations, where the community shared with us
their culture and traditions. The leaders of the community also
taught us about the issues that the community has faced, such as the
sinking of the ferry Queen of the North in March of 2006, and its
effects on the surrounding water. We also learned about the biggest
threat to the Gitgaâ€™atâ€™s way of life, Enbridgeâ€™s Northern
Gateway Project. 
</p>
<p>
During my time in
Hartley Bay, I learned about the Gitga'at's culture and traditions. I
also, saw the incredible beauty and wildlife of the surrounding
natural environment. This was a very powerful experience for me. As a
result, in 2010 I took the opportunity to volunteer at Cetacealab,
located on Gil Island in Gitgaâ€™at territory. I worked with Hermann
Meuter and Janey Wray, two whale researchers, who established
themselves here nine years ago. I helped collect data for their
ongoing research of whale populations. Working here exposed me to the
pressing issue and risks of having oil tankers traveling through the
Great Bear Rainforest. By spending more time up here I had the
chance, again, to reconnect with the unique and amazing environment

This paddle will
raise awareness and encourage youth in both the Gitgaâ€™at and the

importance of such places, and why it is crucial to protect them. The

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">The issue of building an oil pipeline
across two provinces that would pose the risk of an oil spill through
First Nations territories, the beautiful Great Bear Rainforest, and
the BC coast, is not only an issue about building an oil pipeline.
The issue with the Enbridge pipeline is that by allowing
projects like this to go through, Canada commits to continue the expansion of
the Tar Sands, and continue its ever-growing fossil fuel emissions.
By allowing the Enbridge Pipeline to go through, Canada will not take
a stand for social justice and environmental justice, nor will our
government prove its commitment to long term goals that will benefit future
generations. Instead, the project will put the BC province at risk of
disaster, seeing that the potential of an oil spill will be larger
than the well-documented Exxon Valdez spill. 
</p>
<p>
<br/><font size=""2"">By participating in this paddle, we aim to raise awareness about the Northern Gateway Pipeline Project proposed. We want to educate others about the environmental and cultural impact the proposed pipeline will have on the ecology of this region, as well as First Nations groups, coastal citizens, and future generations. Through presentations at high schools, our university, and public venues we hope to educate the public on these type of environmental and social impacts, and we want to promote long term thinking to keep the future in mind.</font></p>

<p class=""p3"" style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We’re a group of six friends with over 30 cumulative years in disaster response–from hurricanes to earthquakes, from wildfires to Haiti’s cholera outbreak. </p>
<p class=""p3"" style=""margin-left: 30px;"">When Superstorm Sandy tore across the east coast on October 29, 2012, we reached for our backpacks, pulled out some tools and made our ways to New York. Within 24 hours we had found our way onto the storm ravaged streets of Rockaway. The scene was reminiscent of another time in our lives when we first met, almost three years ago in the aftermath of the most devastating earthquake Haiti had ever seen.  That was October 30th.  We've all been here since.   </p>
<p class=""p3"" style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Gathering as many tool donations as we could and teaming up with Occupy Sandy to expand our reach, we've spent the last month and a half working in over 100 homes, while regularly logging over 1800 volunteer hours a week. </p>
<p class=""p3"" style=""margin-left: 30px;"">In addition, we also do as much community education on mold, renter's rights, insurance protocols, and FEMA assistance as possible. We offer more than just physical help; we offer an organized and long-term support system for people in the community. The recovery effort in the Rockaways will be a long one, and with your support, we’ll be here to see it through. </p>
<p class=""p3""><strong>Many people in the Rockaways lost so much when Sandy hit. </strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">A 12 ft storm surge flooded the basement and first floor of almost every home on the peninsula.  Now, six weeks after the storm, 12,000 families are still displaced from their flood-damaged homes and unable to return for the holidays.  </p>
<ul>
<li class=""p1"">Mold is taking over those wet homes at an alarming rate. </li>
<li class=""p1"">Short term exposure to some types of mold can cause illness.</li>
<li class=""p1"">Long term exposure can cause chronic disease and even death. </li>
<li class=""p1"">Until the mold can be cleaned and removed, homes are simply not safe for residents to return to. </li>
<li class=""p1"">Homes left untreated will not be livable for much longer.</li>

<p class=""p1"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>For around $1,000 per home we can obtain all the supplies we'll need to fully treat and de-mold a house so families can start planning their moves back in. </strong></p>
<p class=""p3"" style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We do all this free of cost to residents–many of whom have been quoted upwards of $15,000 for the same treatments from bigger companies.  </p>
<p class=""p3"" style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We’ve cut those costs using donated supplies and a volunteer labor force and can only continue to expand our efforts with your support.  Our work helps the Rockaway community build back faster, and with a method trusted by experts we’ve consulted to develop our service.  In addition, we offer trainings to Sandy-affected residents so they can take charge of the recovery process on their own, <span class=""s1"">share information among neighbors</span>, and stay informed.</p>
<p class=""p3"" style=""margin-left: 30px;"">In order to perform a typical mold remediation, our volunteer crews wear protective coveralls, goggles, respirators, gloves and boots to keep safe.  Our method includes commercial mold killer, wire brushes, angle grinders, HEPA vacuums, and most costly, industrial strength dehumidifiers and heaters.  </p>
<p class=""p3"" style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The list of supplies we need is long, but the list of homeowners who need <span class=""s2"">these services</span> is even longer.    </p>

<p class=""p1""><strong>The aftermath of catastrophes like this are heartbreaking, but the response we’ve seen from neighbors, New Yorkers, and the many people from as far away as Michigan, Alaska, and even Belgium who have dropped everything to be part of this relief effort amazes us every day. It’s been organic, exciting, grassroots, and beautiful. Being a part of this effort so close to home has, for many of us, changed what it means to be a part of our communities.</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">We’ve done more than clean out homes.  Together with residents, community members, seasoned relief workers, and devoted volunteers, we have all built a people-powered coalition that continues to grow both a wider reach and deeper roots each day. And our sights are set on the long haul.</p>
<p class=""p1"">We want to see people in Rockaway return to their homes in the coming months, and we’re committed to being part of that process.  We are neighbors training neighbors to help neighbors.  And no matter how far away you live, we want you all to be a part of this.  Along the way with this campaign, we can’t wait to share our progress, as well as personal experiences and the stories of the community that we’ve become so involved in over the past 44 days. </p>

Now, potentially toxic mold is posing a huge public health risk in the area, and our next and most urgent phase of work is to perform free mold treatments on as many of these affected families’ homes as possible.  
From our experience working in the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina, we know firsthand what a health crisis mold can become if not treated swiftly and effectively.
We have a proven process and the infrastructure to implement it. Time is critical. We need tools and supplies. With your help, we can get 250 families back into healthy homes this winter!

We’re a group of six friends with over 30 cumulative years in disaster response–from hurricanes to earthquakes, from wildfires to Haiti’s cholera outbreak. 
When Superstorm Sandy tore across the east coast on October 29, 2012, we reached for our backpacks, pulled out some tools and made our ways to New York. Within 24 hours we had found our way onto the storm ravaged streets of Rockaway. The scene was reminiscent of another time in our lives when we first met, almost three years ago in the aftermath of the most devastating earthquake Haiti had ever seen.  That was October 30th.  We've all been here since.   
Gathering as many tool donations as we could and teaming up with Occupy Sandy to expand our reach, we've spent the last month and a half working in over 100 homes, while regularly logging over 1800 volunteer hours a week. 
In addition, we also do as much community education on mold, renter's rights, insurance protocols, and FEMA assistance as possible. We offer more than just physical help; we offer an organized and long-term support system for people in the community. The recovery effort in the Rockaways will be a long one, and with your support, we’ll be here to see it through. 
Many people in the Rockaways lost so much when Sandy hit. 
A 12 ft storm surge flooded the basement and first floor of almost every home on the peninsula.  Now, six weeks after the storm, 12,000 families are still displaced from their flood-damaged homes and unable to return for the holidays.  

Mold is taking over those wet homes at an alarming rate. 
Short term exposure to some types of mold can cause illness.
Long term exposure can cause chronic disease and even death. 
Until the mold can be cleaned and removed, homes are simply not safe for residents to return to. 
Homes left untreated will not be livable for much longer.
 
For around $1,000 per home we can obtain all the supplies we'll need to fully treat and de-mold a house so families can start planning their moves back in. 
We do all this free of cost to residents–many of whom have been quoted upwards of $15,000 for the same treatments from bigger companies.  
We’ve cut those costs using donated supplies and a volunteer labor force and can only continue to expand our efforts with your support.  Our work helps the Rockaway community build back faster, and with a method trusted by experts we’ve consulted to develop our service.  In addition, we offer trainings to Sandy-affected residents so they can take charge of the recovery process on their own, share information among neighbors, and stay informed.
In order to perform a typical mold remediation, our volunteer crews wear protective coveralls, goggles, respirators, gloves and boots to keep safe.  Our method includes commercial mold killer, wire brushes, angle grinders, HEPA vacuums, and most costly, industrial strength dehumidifiers and heaters.  
The list of supplies we need is long, but the list of homeowners who need these services is even longer.    
 
The aftermath of catastrophes like this are heartbreaking, but the response we’ve seen from neighbors, New Yorkers, and the many people from as far away as Michigan, Alaska, and even Belgium who have dropped everything to be part of this relief effort amazes us every day. It’s been organic, exciting, grassroots, and beautiful. Being a part of this effort so close to home has, for many of us, changed what it means to be a part of our communities.
We’ve done more than clean out homes.  Together with residents, community members, seasoned relief workers, and devoted volunteers, we have all built a people-powered coalition that continues to grow both a wider reach and deeper roots each day. And our sights are set on the long haul.
We want to see people in Rockaway return to their homes in the coming months, and we’re committed to being part of that process.  We are neighbors training neighbors to help neighbors.  And no matter how far away you live, we want you all to be a part of this.  Along the way with this campaign, we can’t wait to share our progress, as well as personal experiences and the stories of the community that we’ve become so involved in over the past 44 days. 
The progress we’ve made with volunteers and donated tools since the storm is amazing. In the weeks and months ahead, we know that with your support we can grow that progress exponentially. Our work speaks for itself. Help us to continue it.
Donate. Volunteer. Spread the word. Respond. Rebuild.

The £20 (1/4 of an acre) reward is a high-quality, limited edition print featuring the collaborative artwork of the amazing artists supporting this project.
The £34 (1/2 an acre) reward features the same artwork, but will also include your name, along with the names of other backers of this reward, printed in a clear gloss around the world.
The £67 (1 acre) reward offers the same poster, but features your name, along with the names of other backers of this reward, in gold foil as well as featuring further gold details added to the print.
 

 

 
Hopefully the campaign will be supported by many backers, which will mean there are a lot of names to appear on the 1/2 acre and 1 acre prints. If this is the case, we will divide the names across multiple prints in that category in order to maintain an appealing aesthetic. You will receive the print featuring your name.
The printing company that we have chosen to work with, Gomer Press, is certified with the Forest Stewardship Council and their paper is universally sourced from sustainable forests.
 

 
We are partnering with Cool Earth, the non-profit organisation that works alongside rainforest communities to halt deforestation and its impact on climate change. Cool Earth are able to protect one acre of rainforest for just £60, so with your help we hope to be able to save hundreds, or even thousands, of acres of rainforest with this project.
“With half of the world’s rainforest lost over the past forty years, we need a new approach to conservation.The only way to halt destruction is to align the future of the rainforest with the people best placed to protect it. This means placing forest in the hands of the people who rely on its survival for their survival.” – Cool Earth
 


 
There will be some unavoidable fulfilment costs involved, but the artists and the 3dtotal team are working on this project as a not-for-profit so the majority of all proceeds can be donated to help save the rainforests. Product packaging is included in the shipping costs
 

 
The above breakdown of funds illustrates how much we can give from each sale if we print 1000 posters. We want to go beyond this though, as the more prints we produce the less each one will cost to manufacture, which will in turn mean we can give more of your pledge to Cool Earth.
 


 
To help promote the campaign and encourage the support of the artistic community 3dtotal have started a month long art challenge. We have set 30 themes which participants can use to inspire an original piece of art. We then encourage people to share their art online using the hash tag #EarthDraw2018. With each image shared we ask artists to mention and share our campaign, so the art community can come together to make a positive change on the environment.
 
We hope you'll consider supporting our mission to create art to create change!

<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">
        A unique and pristine ecosystem unlike any other in the world, Bristol Bay rests along the southwest coast of Alaska. This expansive watershed is home to at least 29 fish species, 40 terrestrial mammals, and more than 190 different birds. </p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">
        Biologists consider the stream and river waters of Bristol Bay exceptionally pure. Low sediment levels mean you can see to the bottom at even the deepest parts. Add high oxygen levels and a steady water flow, and you have <strong>the perfect salmon habitat</strong>.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></p>

<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">
        As they make their journey from the ocean to their spawning grounds, salmon deliver a critical source of nutrients to animal and plant life in the region. At least 138 different species in the watershed rely on salmon as an essential source for protein, Omega 3's, and other nutrients—making salmon a keystone species.<span><br/></span> </p>

<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">
        Bristol Bay accounts for 46% of the world's wild sockeye salmon with an average of 37.5 million fish returning to spawn each year. As 51% of wild sockeye consumed in the US comes from Bristol Bay, it's pretty darn likely that the salmon dinner you enjoyed last month came from here.</p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; margin-top: 18px; color: #005f85;"">THE MINE</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">
        Over the course of 78 years, the Pebble Partnership plans to create an open pit mine nearly a mile deep and three miles wide. The pebble deposit is estimated to hold between $300 and $500 billion in mineral resources and will produce <strong>10.8 billion tons of mining waste</strong>. That's the equivalent of 3,000 lbs. of waste for every single human on earth!</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><br/></p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; margin-top: 18px; color: #005f85;"">
<span><br/></span>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">
        Because of its toxicity, mining waste must be stored and monitored “in perpetuity”—i.e. forever. Current plans will house Pebble’s waste behind multiple 700 ft. tall <a href=""http://www.groundtruthtrekking.org/static/uploads/photos/typical-mine-tailings-dam.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: salmon;"" target=""_blank"">earthen tailings dams</a>. Should this harmful waste leak or get released into the watershed, it would cause irreversible and permanent damage to the surrounding ecosystem.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">
        The sad truth is that open-pit mining has a history of spills, leaks, and accidents. Given the almost unfathomable scale of the Pebble Mine and plans to build it in a wetland environment, it’s hard to imagine leaks won’t occur. The fact that Alaska sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and experiences significant seismic activity doesn’t help much either.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></p>

        To find their spawning grounds, salmon rely on a highly keen sense of smell. Exposure to even trace amounts of copper or other toxic chemicals could impair a salmon's sense of smell and therefore disrupt their ability to find the streams and tributaries where they hatched and where they will in turn, spawn themselves. <a href=""http://www.nwf.org/pdf/Great-Lakes/sulfidemining_wildlife_factsheet.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: salmon;"" target=""_blank"">History</a> and <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969704007016"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: salmon;"" target=""_blank"">science</a> have both proven that <strong>salmon are highly vulnerable to even small changes in water quality</strong>.</p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; margin-top: 18px; color: #005f85;"">COMMERCIAL FISHING</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">
        With access to the largest wild sockeye salmon fishery in the world and the most valuable in Alaska, Bristol Bay's commercial fleet has operated since 1884. Working with wildlife biologists and Alaska’s Department of Fish and Game, fishermen catch a sustainable amount of salmon, ensuring enough make it to the spawning headwaters to continue the cycle.<br/></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; margin-top: 18px; color: #005f85;"">ALASKA NATIVES</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">Alaska Natives have called Bristol Bay home for over 4,000 years. Living subsistence lifestyles, Alaska Natives not only consider salmon part of their cultural and traditional heritage, but rely on them as a major food source. To this day, salmon still provide food security in 25 of the 31 villages in the region.<br/></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; margin-top: 18px; color: #005f85;"">RECREATIONAL &amp; SPORT ANGLING</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">With more than 40 commercial fishing lodges along Bristol Bay tributaries, anglers from all over the world come to fish some of North America’s richest and most productive waters.

<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; margin-top: 18px; color: #005f85;"">THE BRISTOL BAY FOREVER INITIATIVE</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">In 1972, the Alaska Legislature enacted AS 38.05.140(f), establishing the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve and providing protection for salmon populations against potential harm from oil and gas development. Unfortunately the law did not include mining operations... until now.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">The Bristol Bay Forever Initiative will amend the existing law and ensure <i>“large-scale metallic sulfide mining operation(s) will not constitute danger to the fishery within the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve.""</i> This standard of no “danger to the fishery” will apply not only to the Pebble Mine, but to any potential large-scale sulfide mine in the Reserve.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">The Bristol Bay Forever initiative will ensure that “large-scale metallic sulfide mining operation(s) will not constitute danger to the fishery within the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve."" This standard of no “danger to the fishery” will apply not only to the Pebble Mine, but to any potential large-scale metallic sulfide mine in the region.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">A state-based strategy written by an experienced team of professionals with extensive backgrounds in Alaska law and Alaska politics, the Bristol Bay Forever Initiative establishes a long term precedent of protecting Bristol Bay's salmon.<br/></p>

<ul style=""font-size: 18px;"">
<li style=""font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 10px;"">Alaska has historically embraced mining operations. No single mine which has applied for a permit has ever been denied.</li>
<li style=""font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 10px;"">The Pebble Partnership is well funded and has used its resources to influence local, state, and federal government agencies.</li>
<li style=""font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 10px;"">We anticipate the Pebble Partnership will do everything in their power to defeat the Initiative.</li>

<p><font size=""4""><br/></font></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; margin-top: 18px; color: #005f85;"">EPA ACTION</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">This past February, the United States Environmental Protection Agency announced they were initiating a process under the Clean Water Act “to identify appropriate options to protect the world’s largest sockeye salmon fishery in Bristol Bay.” </p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">While the EPA’s response to the requests of local tribal groups and <i>hundreds of thousands</i> of US citizens is taking steps towards protecting Bristol Bay, it’s not enough. In a state built on self-reliance and a spirit deeply connected to the land, it’s incredibly important for Alaskans to control their own fate. Passing the Initiative ensures the Alaska Legislature gains oversight of major mining operations like Pebble.
    </p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><br/></p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">Facts to consider:</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 18px;"">
<li style=""font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 10px;"">A number of steps must occur before the EPA decides whether or not to block the mine. This process will likely take a year or more to complete.</li>
<li style=""font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 10px;"">Several political leaders in Alaska and Washington D.C. have publicly called a preemptive veto of the mine “extreme federal overreach.”</li>
<li style=""font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 10px;"">The EPA has initiated a review process under the Clean Water Act 29 times in history. They’ve issued restrictions in 12 of those cases and have only prohibited one project that had not yet applied for a dredge-and-fill permit. Pebble would be the second… ever.</li>
<li style=""font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 10px;"">If carried through, there’s no guarantee this decision won’t be overturned by future EPA Administrators (who typically change with each new presidential administration).</li>
</ul>
<p><font size=""4""><br/></font></p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">Only time will tell what actions the EPA might take. One thing is for sure, <strong>we cannot afford to just stand on the sidelines</strong> and watch the process unfold. </p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 16px; margin-top: 18px; color: #005f85;"">FOR ALASKA, BY ALASKA</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">On November 4th, 2014 the Bristol Bay Forever Initiative will appear on the Alaska ballot. If passed, it grants the Alaska Legislature authority to determine the fate of any large-scale mine in the Reserve without the influence of the federal government. It will hold potential mining operations to the highest standard and it will ensure Alaskan oversight over an Alaskan treasure.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">Independent scientific studies all conclude the Pebble Mine poses far too large a threat to the salmon, the people of Bristol Bay, and the region’s incredibly rich biodiversity. <strong>Failure to protect this pristine resource is not an option.</strong></p>

        Majestic and practically untouched, Bristol Bay, Alaska provides spawning grounds for half of the world’s wild sockeye salmon. With sustainable commercial fishing providing thousands of jobs, world-class waters for anglers, and many Alaska Native villages still living subsistence lifestyles, salmon are deeply intertwined in the region's culture and economy. 

        Given massive discoveries of gold and copper deep below the surface of Bristol Bay’s headwaters, a foreign mining conglomerate called the Pebble Partnership plans to build North America's largest open pit mine. Should toxic mining waste from the Pebble Mine find its way into the watershed, the effects would prove catastrophic to salmon and the entire ecosystem.

BRISTOL BAY

        A unique and pristine ecosystem unlike any other in the world, Bristol Bay rests along the southwest coast of Alaska. This expansive watershed is home to at least 29 fish species, 40 terrestrial mammals, and more than 190 different birds. 

        Biologists consider the stream and river waters of Bristol Bay exceptionally pure. Low sediment levels mean you can see to the bottom at even the deepest parts. Add high oxygen levels and a steady water flow, and you have the perfect salmon habitat.



A KEYSTONE SPECIES

        As they make their journey from the ocean to their spawning grounds, salmon deliver a critical source of nutrients to animal and plant life in the region. At least 138 different species in the watershed rely on salmon as an essential source for protein, Omega 3's, and other nutrients—making salmon a keystone species. 







A TASTY MEAL

        Bristol Bay accounts for 46% of the world's wild sockeye salmon with an average of 37.5 million fish returning to spawn each year. As 51% of wild sockeye consumed in the US comes from Bristol Bay, it's pretty darn likely that the salmon dinner you enjoyed last month came from here.







Wrong Mine, Wrong Place
THE MINE

        Over the course of 78 years, the Pebble Partnership plans to create an open pit mine nearly a mile deep and three miles wide. The pebble deposit is estimated to hold between $300 and $500 billion in mineral resources and will produce 10.8 billion tons of mining waste. That's the equivalent of 3,000 lbs. of waste for every single human on earth!






ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

        Because of its toxicity, mining waste must be stored and monitored “in perpetuity”—i.e. forever. Current plans will house Pebble’s waste behind multiple 700 ft. tall earthen tailings dams. Should this harmful waste leak or get released into the watershed, it would cause irreversible and permanent damage to the surrounding ecosystem.

        The sad truth is that open-pit mining has a history of spills, leaks, and accidents. Given the almost unfathomable scale of the Pebble Mine and plans to build it in a wetland environment, it’s hard to imagine leaks won’t occur. The fact that Alaska sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and experiences significant seismic activity doesn’t help much either.







        To find their spawning grounds, salmon rely on a highly keen sense of smell. Exposure to even trace amounts of copper or other toxic chemicals could impair a salmon's sense of smell and therefore disrupt their ability to find the streams and tributaries where they hatched and where they will in turn, spawn themselves. History and science have both proven that salmon are highly vulnerable to even small changes in water quality.




Economic & Cultural Value
COMMERCIAL FISHING

        With access to the largest wild sockeye salmon fishery in the world and the most valuable in Alaska, Bristol Bay's commercial fleet has operated since 1884. Working with wildlife biologists and Alaska’s Department of Fish and Game, fishermen catch a sustainable amount of salmon, ensuring enough make it to the spawning headwaters to continue the cycle.
ALASKA NATIVES
Alaska Natives have called Bristol Bay home for over 4,000 years. Living subsistence lifestyles, Alaska Natives not only consider salmon part of their cultural and traditional heritage, but rely on them as a major food source. To this day, salmon still provide food security in 25 of the 31 villages in the region.
RECREATIONAL & SPORT ANGLING
With more than 40 commercial fishing lodges along Bristol Bay tributaries, anglers from all over the world come to fish some of North America’s richest and most productive waters. Their sport helps drive a strong recreation and tourism industry year after year.








State-Based Solution
THE BRISTOL BAY FOREVER INITIATIVE
In 1972, the Alaska Legislature enacted AS 38.05.140(f), establishing the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve and providing protection for salmon populations against potential harm from oil and gas development. Unfortunately the law did not include mining operations... until now.
The Bristol Bay Forever Initiative will amend the existing law and ensure “large-scale metallic sulfide mining operation(s) will not constitute danger to the fishery within the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve."" This standard of no “danger to the fishery” will apply not only to the Pebble Mine, but to any potential large-scale sulfide mine in the Reserve.
The Bristol Bay Forever initiative will ensure that “large-scale metallic sulfide mining operation(s) will not constitute danger to the fishery within the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve."" This standard of no “danger to the fishery” will apply not only to the Pebble Mine, but to any potential large-scale metallic sulfide mine in the region.
A state-based strategy written by an experienced team of professionals with extensive backgrounds in Alaska law and Alaska politics, the Bristol Bay Forever Initiative establishes a long term precedent of protecting Bristol Bay's salmon.

CHALLENGES

Alaska has historically embraced mining operations. No single mine which has applied for a permit has ever been denied.
The Pebble Partnership is well funded and has used its resources to influence local, state, and federal government agencies.
We anticipate the Pebble Partnership will do everything in their power to defeat the Initiative.




EPA ACTION
This past February, the United States Environmental Protection Agency announced they were initiating a process under the Clean Water Act “to identify appropriate options to protect the world’s largest sockeye salmon fishery in Bristol Bay.” 
While the EPA’s response to the requests of local tribal groups and hundreds of thousands of US citizens is taking steps towards protecting Bristol Bay, it’s not enough. In a state built on self-reliance and a spirit deeply connected to the land, it’s incredibly important for Alaskans to control their own fate. Passing the Initiative ensures the Alaska Legislature gains oversight of major mining operations like Pebble.
    

Facts to consider:

A number of steps must occur before the EPA decides whether or not to block the mine. This process will likely take a year or more to complete.
Several political leaders in Alaska and Washington D.C. have publicly called a preemptive veto of the mine “extreme federal overreach.”
The EPA has initiated a review process under the Clean Water Act 29 times in history. They’ve issued restrictions in 12 of those cases and have only prohibited one project that had not yet applied for a dredge-and-fill permit. Pebble would be the second… ever.
If carried through, there’s no guarantee this decision won’t be overturned by future EPA Administrators (who typically change with each new presidential administration).


Only time will tell what actions the EPA might take. One thing is for sure, we cannot afford to just stand on the sidelines and watch the process unfold. 


FOR ALASKA, BY ALASKA
On November 4th, 2014 the Bristol Bay Forever Initiative will appear on the Alaska ballot. If passed, it grants the Alaska Legislature authority to determine the fate of any large-scale mine in the Reserve without the influence of the federal government. It will hold potential mining operations to the highest standard and it will ensure Alaskan oversight over an Alaskan treasure.
Independent scientific studies all conclude the Pebble Mine poses far too large a threat to the salmon, the people of Bristol Bay, and the region’s incredibly rich biodiversity. Failure to protect this pristine resource is not an option.
Please join our ranks and share this story today.




MONEY RAISED
Funds raised go directly to Bristol Bay Forever Inc. and will be spent on TV spots, print ads, door-to-door campaigns, and everything else that goes into passing a citizen-based initiative. Once fully aware, educated, and inspired to vote, we are confident an overwhelming majority of Alaskans will do their part when the time comes.



ABOUT US
We're a small group of individuals acting on behalf of  Bristol Bay Forever Inc., a non-profit 501(c)(6) organization whose sole purpose is to pass the Initiative. After researching the Pebble Mine and realizing the harm it could bring to such an incredible resource, we decided to take a stance and educate others who might not otherwise be aware. Plus we enjoy eating wild salmon too.

<p></p>
<p><span>Five years ago, our network of young Pacific Islanders began to form under the name of 350 Pacific, to join with the global climate change movement, 350.org. Active in 15 of the Pacific Island Nations, we have a unique approach of empowering young people to understand the issue of climate change and to take action to protect and enrich our islands, cultures, and oceans.</span></p>
<p>We know that this project is beyond what we can deliver on our own. We don’t have big bank accounts, big funders, or big email lists. That’s why we’re asking the international community to stand in support with the Pacific Warriors.</p>What we do have is the network of courageous young Pacific Islanders – from Niue to Tuvalu – that have been learning the skills of canoe building from their elders, are clued up about how climate change is affecting their Islands, and are ready to stand up peacefully but powerfully as warriors for their Islands. </div><div>

</h3>
<div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>As Pacific Warriors we will journey to Australia to stand up to the fossil fuel industry in person and demand they stop their radical plans that are destroying our island homes. We will travel the country, bringing our story of struggle directly to the Australian people and make a call-to-arms, a request that Australians take up the fight to the fossil fuel industry to save our homelands. <b>We will use traditional hand-made canoes t<span>o paddle out into the harbour of the world’s largest coal port - Newcastle - to stop coal exports for a day. </span></b></p>
<p>We will use these canoes to lay down a challenge to the fossil fuel industry, and to highlight what we will lose if their reckless contribution to climate change continues. This will be a means of telling the industry, the Australian public, their Government, and the global community that climate change is having a real impact and is threatening the culture, health and environment of our Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>We know that many Australians are ready to stand with us. As we arrive, Australians around the country have already pledged to join our flotilla, to attend our talks and stand in solidarity because our fight is their fight too. From those fighting against the construction of new coal mines at Maules Creek and in the Galilee Basin, to those working on essential policy changes, Australians will collectively stand up to say “we will not let our neighbours drown.”</p>This is a huge undertaking. Building and transporting canoes and at least 30 Pacific Warriors all costs <b>a lot</b>. We can’t do it without you!<br/><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Where the money goes</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>Every dollar donated goes straight to the costs of shipping the canoes, and the journey for the warriors to Australia. Our teams in the Islands have been fundraising locally to build the canoes. We need to reach the full target to have all our warriors and canoes represented on the journey.</span></p>Any amount from $20 to $20,000 will be hugely appreciated. The more we raise, the bigger impact we can have!<br/><p><br/></p>
<h3>How climate change is impacting our islands</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>The Pacific Islands are already witnessing the effects of climate change. A majority are dependent on subsistence agriculture, but with more intense tropical cyclones, flash floods and droughts, food production systems are increasingly vulnerable. Coastal systems and ecosystems are already adversely affected, with erosion impacting in places like the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Tokelau and Kiribati. Coral reefs and water resources are also now at risk, and scientists have warned that if the world doesn’t change track now, we face losing much more.</span></p>
<p>The Pacific Islands are already world leaders in looking to renewable energy - countries like Tokelau are 100% powered by solar energy. Pacific Islanders are working very hard to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - however small we may be. </p>
<p><b>Yet many of the countries most responsible for climate change are doing next to nothing to curb emissions. </b>In fact, Australia has recently approved a huge expansion of its coal and gas exports at a time when we are on the edge of climate disaster. The recently federally approved Carmichael Mine not only requires dredging of the Great Barrier Reef, the destruction of over 10,000 hectares housing multiple endangered species, but alongside the other 8 proposed megamines in the Galilee Basin, will burn through 5% of the world’s carbon budget – from one basin in Queensland alone! These exports already operate on a scale that is almost unimaginable.</p>All this coal and gas will have a devastating impact on the Pacific Islands.</div>

Five years ago, our network of young Pacific Islanders began to form under the name of 350 Pacific, to join with the global climate change movement, 350.org. Active in 15 of the Pacific Island Nations, we have a unique approach of empowering young people to understand the issue of climate change and to take action to protect and enrich our islands, cultures, and oceans.
We know that this project is beyond what we can deliver on our own. We don’t have big bank accounts, big funders, or big email lists. That’s why we’re asking the international community to stand in support with the Pacific Warriors.What we do have is the network of courageous young Pacific Islanders – from Niue to Tuvalu – that have been learning the skills of canoe building from their elders, are clued up about how climate change is affecting their Islands, and are ready to stand up peacefully but powerfully as warriors for their Islands. 



The Pacific Warrior Journey




As Pacific Warriors we will journey to Australia to stand up to the fossil fuel industry in person and demand they stop their radical plans that are destroying our island homes. We will travel the country, bringing our story of struggle directly to the Australian people and make a call-to-arms, a request that Australians take up the fight to the fossil fuel industry to save our homelands. We will use traditional hand-made canoes to paddle out into the harbour of the world’s largest coal port - Newcastle - to stop coal exports for a day. 
We will use these canoes to lay down a challenge to the fossil fuel industry, and to highlight what we will lose if their reckless contribution to climate change continues. This will be a means of telling the industry, the Australian public, their Government, and the global community that climate change is having a real impact and is threatening the culture, health and environment of our Pacific Islands.
We know that many Australians are ready to stand with us. As we arrive, Australians around the country have already pledged to join our flotilla, to attend our talks and stand in solidarity because our fight is their fight too. From those fighting against the construction of new coal mines at Maules Creek and in the Galilee Basin, to those working on essential policy changes, Australians will collectively stand up to say “we will not let our neighbours drown.”This is a huge undertaking. Building and transporting canoes and at least 30 Pacific Warriors all costs a lot. We can’t do it without you!
Where the money goes

Every dollar donated goes straight to the costs of shipping the canoes, and the journey for the warriors to Australia. Our teams in the Islands have been fundraising locally to build the canoes. We need to reach the full target to have all our warriors and canoes represented on the journey.Any amount from $20 to $20,000 will be hugely appreciated. The more we raise, the bigger impact we can have!
How climate change is impacting our islands

The Pacific Islands are already witnessing the effects of climate change. A majority are dependent on subsistence agriculture, but with more intense tropical cyclones, flash floods and droughts, food production systems are increasingly vulnerable. Coastal systems and ecosystems are already adversely affected, with erosion impacting in places like the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Tokelau and Kiribati. Coral reefs and water resources are also now at risk, and scientists have warned that if the world doesn’t change track now, we face losing much more.
The Pacific Islands are already world leaders in looking to renewable energy - countries like Tokelau are 100% powered by solar energy. Pacific Islanders are working very hard to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - however small we may be. 
Yet many of the countries most responsible for climate change are doing next to nothing to curb emissions. In fact, Australia has recently approved a huge expansion of its coal and gas exports at a time when we are on the edge of climate disaster. The recently federally approved Carmichael Mine not only requires dredging of the Great Barrier Reef, the destruction of over 10,000 hectares housing multiple endangered species, but alongside the other 8 proposed megamines in the Galilee Basin, will burn through 5% of the world’s carbon budget – from one basin in Queensland alone! These exports already operate on a scale that is almost unimaginable.All this coal and gas will have a devastating impact on the Pacific Islands.

<p>Hi, my name is Peggy Hiers. Im a student at Florida International University in Miami, Fl. working toward a bachelor's degree who is thrilled about an opportunity to volunteer and help an environment in need. The International Student Volunteers organization has accepted my application to go to Australia this summer for 4 weeks where I will volunteer on a conservation project. Most of the projects involve habitat restoration and are geared toward the protection and rehabilitation of the environments in which Australia's unique animals live.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, students accepted to volunteer abroad with ISV must pay their own way.  Indiegogo is one of the recommended ways to raise funds for the trip.  If I can raise the needed funds, I will not only be able to make a difference in the world, I will be able to show the volunteer experience on resumes and applications for scholarships and internships. The most rewarding part however would be the opportunity to help the environment and the animals who depend on that environment to survive.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<p>My program costs include my accommodations, most meals, project materials and support, ground transportation, and tour guidance in Australia. These costs will directly help me gain more knowledge and help with conservation efforts. You are making a direct contribution for conservation. The program cost is about $5,000. I have saved about $1,500 on my own, but I need your help! All the money raised will go toward the total program cost.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How Does This Help?</h3>
<div>The ISV program has been organizing these volunteer efforts for almost 30 years. In that time, they've clocked over 220000 hours of volunteer work in six different countries, protected and relocatetd 8570 endangered sea turtle eggs, and spent over 27500 hours teaching music, English, conservation, recreation, &amp; health programs to over 4100 children.</div>

<h3>What You Can Do</h3>
<p>Not everyone is in a position to help out financially, but that's okay! Please, if you can, spread the word. Tell friends, family, post this site on facebook, do whatever you feel to help get the word out there. You never know who of your friends may feel inclined to donate!</p>

<p class=""p1""><strong>GREAT CANADIAN SHORELINE CLEANUP - WWF and Vancouver Aquarium </strong></p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p2"">In 1994, a small team of employees and volunteers at the Vancouver Aquarium decided to clean up a local beach in Stanley Park to help protect the city’s shorelines. They submitted the data collected during this event to the International Coastal Cleanup, a global program managed by the Ocean Conservancy. By 1997, 400 volunteers were participating in 20 sites across British Columbia as part of the Great BC Beach Cleanup.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p2"">In 2002, the Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup emerged as a national program, providing all Canadians the opportunity to make a difference in their local communities. Cleanups started appearing in every province and territory, and by 2003, more than 20,000 volunteers were taking part.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p2"">Over the following years, the program continued to expand its reach and influence, aided by the support of sponsors, donors, and partners (such as WWF Canada, who became a full partner of the Shoreline Cleanup in 2010). Public support and interest in the program also grew as Canadians gradually became more aware of the harmful effects of shoreline litter on both fragile aquatic ecosystems and people.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p2"">In 2011, the Shoreline Cleanup celebrated its 18th anniversary with more than 56,000 volunteers, and piloted the first spring cleanup for school groups in British Columbia. Today, it is recognized as one of the largest direct action conservation programs, as well as the most significant contributor to the International Coastal Cleanup in Canada.</p>

Our Vancouver chapter is 100% volunteer run by everyday people like you.
 
Founded in southern California in the early eighties, Surfrider Foundation started with a couple of surfers concerned about the possible destruction of their favourite wave. Since then it has grown to a network of chapters around the world that believe global challenges can be addressed through local grassroots actions.
 
We’re more than just surfers. We’re a community of beach and ocean enthusiasts who share a common vision of healthy and accessible oceans and coastlines, for now and for generations to come. We play an active role in the Vancouver community through outreach and education programs. We create opportunities for activism on issues of ocean and coastal pollution.

GREAT CANADIAN SHORELINE CLEANUP - WWF and Vancouver Aquarium 
 
In 1994, a small team of employees and volunteers at the Vancouver Aquarium decided to clean up a local beach in Stanley Park to help protect the city’s shorelines. They submitted the data collected during this event to the International Coastal Cleanup, a global program managed by the Ocean Conservancy. By 1997, 400 volunteers were participating in 20 sites across British Columbia as part of the Great BC Beach Cleanup.
 
In 2002, the Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup emerged as a national program, providing all Canadians the opportunity to make a difference in their local communities. Cleanups started appearing in every province and territory, and by 2003, more than 20,000 volunteers were taking part.
 
Over the following years, the program continued to expand its reach and influence, aided by the support of sponsors, donors, and partners (such as WWF Canada, who became a full partner of the Shoreline Cleanup in 2010). Public support and interest in the program also grew as Canadians gradually became more aware of the harmful effects of shoreline litter on both fragile aquatic ecosystems and people.
 
In 2011, the Shoreline Cleanup celebrated its 18th anniversary with more than 56,000 volunteers, and piloted the first spring cleanup for school groups in British Columbia. Today, it is recognized as one of the largest direct action conservation programs, as well as the most significant contributor to the International Coastal Cleanup in Canada.

<h3>Frogs in Airports!</h3>
<p>Please help SAVE THE FROGS! raise the $500 we need to get TWO of these 4x5' educational posters up in John Wayne International Airport outside Los Angeles. SAVE THE FROGS! has educated tens of thousands of people about frogs through <a href=""http://savethefrogs.com/airports"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our partnerships with airports around the USA</a>. The airports donate us free ad space that they usually sell to for-profits for thousands of dollars per month. All we need to do is cover the cost of the poster printing. That's where you can help! For only $500, we can get two huge educational frog posters up in John Wayne International Airport outside Los Angeles. Some of our airport posters stay up for several years, so this is a fantastic opportunity! Please donate and help us SAVE THE FROGS!</p>
<p>The poster lists seven major threats to frogs across the top, and why frogs are important across the bottom. It also introduces people to SAVE THE FROGS! and our mission, so it will help us get a lot of new supporters. The huge URL will also drive lots of students and teachers to <a href=""http://savethefrogs.com/airports"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">savethefrogs.com</a>, which has over 300 pages of free information on amphibians and how to protect them for future generations. </p>

I am SO excited to turn it into a sustainable living project - off grid, living off the land, permaculture, and community.

He was raised on a sheep farm in the Cape Province of South Africa and later on a cattle farm in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where his love of the land, and its animals, was nurtured. In 1992, at the age of 50, after having made a good living from developing holiday resorts, John bought his first wildlife ranch. Mauricedale Game Ranch, situated just south of the world renowned Kruger National Park, became a fabulous success with John combining his business acumen, his knowledge of farming, and his passion for wildlife. In 1993, he acquired his first rhino, and he soon fell in love with this iconic species. For the next 13 years, he successfully bred 143 rhino calves from a breeding herd of 130 Southern White Rhino, until tragedy struck in 2007. This was when he lost his first rhino to poachers. He realised then that Mauricedale's proximity to both the Mozambiquan border, and the Kruger National Park, exposed his rhino to far too much danger, and he made the difficult decision in 2008 to relocate to the safer North West Province of South Africa. This more remote location, as well as the flat expansive savanna grassland provided the ideal habitat for his rhino and afforded much better security options.</p><p>With the escalating poaching crisis, and consequent security costs rising exponentially, as well as the risk to human life becoming ever greater, more and more rhino custodians in Southern Africa started dis-investing in rhino.  John saw this as a grave risk to the future of rhino, and it prompted him to register the first Captive Breeding Facility for Southern White Rhinos in South Africa, to serve as a safety net for our dwindling wild rhino population numbers. And so, in 2009, BDR was officially founded. With the exceptional breeding accomplished by the project, additional land has since been acquired, onto which to expand the project to provide more habitat for the resident rhino. </p><p>With no means to earn an income from breeding and protecting all these rhino, John decided to slowly start selling off his holiday resorts to continue funding BDR. Now, after 10 years, he has invested over US$100m of his life's earnings into the project, and he has sadly reached the end of his financial wherewithal to continue. He would thus greatly appreciate any support you could offer.</p><p>For a deeper insights into the BDR Project, and to meet some of the team, please see ""Additional Resources"" at the end of this campaign pitch, where we discuss:- </p><ul>

A helicopter with a full-time pilot flies regular patrols over the project.</p><p>It should be mentioned that, since the BDR's inception in 2009, the national number of rhino lost due to poaching in South Africa has reached well over 7000 rhino. BDR, however, has only lost a total of 32 rhino during the same period, and has just celebrated 15 months of no poaching losses.</p><p><strong>Stefran Broekman, our Security Manager, with his elite armed reaction unit</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528008876/gkddt8imctqi07og1g6s.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528463654/rpoh3tbswvffdhzhg2ke.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Sadly, the days of solely depending on manpower for the effective protection of rhinos, are long gone.  In many cases where poaching takes place, it is the human element inside the security force that betrays the rhino.  Internal involvement is unfortunately the greatest threat in any wildlife reserve. </p><p>BDR have thus opted for a counter-poaching strategy which allows them to reduce manpower and increase the use of technology.  They recently trialed the installation of a super high-tech electronic early-warning security system including radar and thermal cameras with intelligent video analytics, license plate recognition and other optical and audio sensors. Detection, target identification and tracking are handled by the technology system rather than having to rely on a human ops room controller, and is done outside the BDR perimeter, thus enabling BDR to address the threat long before it gets anywhere close to their rhinos. </p><p>The human element is then only brought in once a target has been identified and confirmed to be a threat.  A reaction force is dispatched with helicopter and mobile vehicle reaction units.  These units are made up of well experienced reaction team rangers equipped to work day and night together with a K9 (tracker dog) ability to increase their effectiveness even more.         </p><p>This trial returned extraordinary results, with drastically reduced numbers of poaching events, and BDR would now like to expand this system to cover all 1600+ rhinos across the entire 8000-hectare project.   </p><p>The proposed solution will cast a virtual fence around, and a virtual blanket over, the entire project, allowing the incredible team at BDR to stay one step ahead of the very sophisticated poaching syndicates.  It is  a technology solution that serves as force multiplier, whilst reducing the human element.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528012365/m3zcdhfrdhnoaoj3yb90.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528463756/udjh6timoxgxudadwcw8.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><p>The proposed solution unfortunately comes at an enormous initial capital cost of US$3 million (ZAR38 million), but will allow BDR to cut their monthly operational costs significantly, rendering the project way more sustainable into the future.  As already mentioned above, after investing over US$100 million of his own savings into his rhinos, and not being able to generate sufficient funding from the sale of horn, John has sadly reached the end of his financial wherewithal to continue funding this project. BDR is therefore looking for you to support the funding of this innovative security solution, so that they can better protect their rhinos.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">

Each camp has a dedicated Camp Master, as well as a Relief Camp Master to cover the period when the Main Camp Master is on leave.  The Camp Masters know every rhino in their respective camps intimately, and can identify each rhino from its unique ear notching and habits.  It is their duty to observe and report daily on their respective rhino, and they happily walk tens of kilometers in this endeavor.</p><p>Each camp is subdivided into 2 sections to allow for rotational grazing to occur. Every spring, just after the first rains of the season, the team close the middle gates and keep the rhinos confined to one section of the camp for approximately 3 months. This allows the grass in the 'rested' half of the camp to go to seed. When all the seed has been shed, the gates are reopened, and for the remaining 9 months the rhinos graze in the full expanse of their camp. During the winter months, additional supplementary feed is made available for the rhino, to ensure their nutritional requirements are addressed, and to maintain good health through the dry season.  Each camp has several water sources for the rhino, both from natural springs as well as earth-filled dams. Mud baths are provided in all the camps which the rhinos use regularly, especially when it is hot.</p><p>The natural vegetation in the camps is continually monitored by employing the services of a qualified and experienced Ecologist who conducts fixed point veld (field) condition assessments annually in each of the camps.  These survey results are integrated into the overall BDR Ecological Management Strategy.  BDR further provide for the nutritional requirements of their rhino through extensive and ongoing veld improvement projects, and indigenous trees are routinely planted in the camps to help re-establish the natural ecosystem of the land.  With the added help of a Nutritionist and a full time Wildlife Veterinarian, BDR keep their rhinos in excellent condition.</p><p>BDR is also spear heading valuable research into rhino, working in close conjunction with both national and international research institutes, to learn more about this iconic species, and they share this knowledge to help other rhino populations.</p><p><strong>Johnny Hennop, BDR General Manager and some of his Camp Masters and Support Staff</strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528622258/qebvdbv0cg98m5092aiv.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528468940/zcnvq6bkpxz2zqt6zyap.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2>Breeding Rhino</h2><p>Over the past 10 years, BDR has successfully grown their herd of rhinos from an initial 250 to 1,626. They are hoping to finally meet their breeding target of 200 rhino calves per year, by the end of this financial year (Feb 2019), and then to sustain this for many years to come.  At the moment BDR have around 300 pregnant female rhino, and are on target to meet this BHAG (big hairy audacious goal).</p><p>This excellent breeding performance is achieved through establishment of large sub-populations of at least 20-40 founder breeding cows per camp. To adhere to the competition effect, each camp has more than one dominant breeding bull, as well as several sub adult males within the herd, to allow for natural selection by females. All breeding is done 100% naturally without any artificial intervention. To conserve natural social behavior and dynamics, calves and juveniles are allowed to grow up along with their dams (mothers) in their relevant camps.</p><p>To prevent and reduce the incidence of possible inbreeding, strict records are kept of all matings, matings leading to births, all births, as well as recorded dams and sires. This ensures that proper population dynamics are maintained and managed by way of an up-to-date studbook.</p><p>Additional land onto which new breeding sub-populations can be established, by relocating sub-adult progeny born to the project, is constantly purchased for habitat expansion. This ensures that sub-adult progeny are removed from their dams and sires, as well as ensuring that the current camps do not exceed their relevant carrying capacities. When rhino are translocated into these new camps, a few are selected from each of the existing breeding camps to ensure the newly established camp has the broadest possible gene pool.   Any bulls not required for mating are housed in dedicated bachelor camps where they will spend the rest of their natural life.</p><p>The BDR Team recently celebrated two incredible landmark moments for their project which are discussed below.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Platimum - BDR's 1000th Rhino Baby</strong></p></li></ul><p>Meet Platinum.  He is BDR's 1000th rhino calf born onto the project in the North West Province on 6 April 2018, after 10 years of the project's existence.  He weighed between 50-60kgs at birth and he is doing very well. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528021780/lej8uermomsxcr4tzam3.jpg"" src=""""/></p><ul><li><p><strong>Gugu - BDR's first F2 progeny</strong></p></li></ul><p>Meet Gugu (Zulu for ""precious"").

Just like your hair and nails, rhino horn grows back after trimming, at a rate of around 10cm per year. This equates to around 1.5kg of new horn from a male, and 0.75kg from a female, every year.  Rhinos on BDR are routinely trimmed, primarily to render them less attractive to poaching syndicates.  BDR would ideally only like to trim every 2.5 years, but with the insidious poaching crisis underway, it is currently done every 1.8 years per rhino. With their new security system in place (the target of this CrowdFund), BDR hope to be able to extend this trimming interval to as long as 3.5, or even 4 years per rhino.</p><p>This trimming process is regulated by the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEMBA) (Act No. 10 of 2004) and the Threatened or Protected Species (TOPS) Regulations, 2007. For a rhino horn to be trimmed, a permit must first be acquired from the Department of Nature Conservation. The trimming process then  takes less than 20 minutes per rhino, and is conducted under light sedation and under the supervision of a qualified and experienced Wildlife Veterinarian. The horn is trimmed using an electric saw about 8cm above the growth plate where there is no bone, nerves or blood vessels. It is an entirely painless process as well as non-permanent.

</ul><p>DOCUMENT ENDS</p></div>","Buffalo Dream Ranch (BDR) was so named initially to hide its primary purpose of breeding rhino from poachers.  In a world where poaching is threatening the rhino to the point of extinction, John Hume, one of the world’s greatest rhino conservationists and a passionate campaigner against their extinction, together with an extremely dedicated team, protect and care for 1626 rhinos, of which 1044 have been bred on BDR.  BDR's mission is to “Breed Better, Protect Better”. John Fredrick Hume was born on 25th January 1942. He was raised on a sheep farm in the Cape Province of South Africa and later on a cattle farm in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where his love of the land, and its animals, was nurtured. In 1992, at the age of 50, after having made a good living from developing holiday resorts, John bought his first wildlife ranch. Mauricedale Game Ranch, situated just south of the world renowned Kruger National Park, became a fabulous success with John combining his business acumen, his knowledge of farming, and his passion for wildlife. In 1993, he acquired his first rhino, and he soon fell in love with this iconic species. For the next 13 years, he successfully bred 143 rhino calves from a breeding herd of 130 Southern White Rhino, until tragedy struck in 2007. This was when he lost his first rhino to poachers. He realised then that Mauricedale's proximity to both the Mozambiquan border, and the Kruger National Park, exposed his rhino to far too much danger, and he made the difficult decision in 2008 to relocate to the safer North West Province of South Africa. This more remote location, as well as the flat expansive savanna grassland provided the ideal habitat for his rhino and afforded much better security options.With the escalating poaching crisis, and consequent security costs rising exponentially, as well as the risk to human life becoming ever greater, more and more rhino custodians in Southern Africa started dis-investing in rhino.  John saw this as a grave risk to the future of rhino, and it prompted him to register the first Captive Breeding Facility for Southern White Rhinos in South Africa, to serve as a safety net for our dwindling wild rhino population numbers. And so, in 2009, BDR was officially founded. With the exceptional breeding accomplished by the project, additional land has since been acquired, onto which to expand the project to provide more habitat for the resident rhino. With no means to earn an income from breeding and protecting all these rhino, John decided to slowly start selling off his holiday resorts to continue funding BDR. Now, after 10 years, he has invested over US$100m of his life's earnings into the project, and he has sadly reached the end of his financial wherewithal to continue. He would thus greatly appreciate any support you could offer.For a deeper insights into the BDR Project, and to meet some of the team, please see ""Additional Resources"" at the end of this campaign pitch, where we discuss:-

The Rhino Extinction Problem
Poaching as it relates to Trade
But for now, back to the business of this campaign. Since the current scourge of rhino poaching started in South Africa in 2008/9 with firstly rumours, and then the implementation, of a Moratorium on Domestic Trade in Rhino Horn, extraordinary measures have been required to protect the last remaining rhinos roaming our planet.  Rhinos have been systematically poached (murdered) in South African national parks for their horns, reaching death rates of over 3 per day (over 1000 per year), and as a result these parks have had to significantly strengthen their security.  This increased security together with the ever-dwindling numbers of rhinos in national parks have shifted the threat of poaching, and thus the burden of protection, to private rhino reserves like BDR.  BDR's current operating costs run at over ZAR 5 million (US$ 400,000 @ R12.50 = US$1) per month, with more than half of that going directly to security. BDR's rhino protection program currently comprises the implementation of 60 permanently employed security personnel patrolling on foot and in vehicles, paired with elite reaction units of heavily armed soldiers. A helicopter with a full-time pilot flies regular patrols over the project.It should be mentioned that, since the BDR's inception in 2009, the national number of rhino lost due to poaching in South Africa has reached well over 7000 rhino. BDR, however, has only lost a total of 32 rhino during the same period, and has just celebrated 15 months of no poaching losses.Stefran Broekman, our Security Manager, with his elite armed reaction unitSadly, the days of solely depending on manpower for the effective protection of rhinos, are long gone.  In many cases where poaching takes place, it is the human element inside the security force that betrays the rhino.  Internal involvement is unfortunately the greatest threat in any wildlife reserve. BDR have thus opted for a counter-poaching strategy which allows them to reduce manpower and increase the use of technology.  They recently trialed the installation of a super high-tech electronic early-warning security system including radar and thermal cameras with intelligent video analytics, license plate recognition and other optical and audio sensors. Detection, target identification and tracking are handled by the technology system rather than having to rely on a human ops room controller, and is done outside the BDR perimeter, thus enabling BDR to address the threat long before it gets anywhere close to their rhinos. The human element is then only brought in once a target has been identified and confirmed to be a threat.  A reaction force is dispatched with helicopter and mobile vehicle reaction units.  These units are made up of well experienced reaction team rangers equipped to work day and night together with a K9 (tracker dog) ability to increase their effectiveness even more.         This trial returned extraordinary results, with drastically reduced numbers of poaching events, and BDR would now like to expand this system to cover all 1600+ rhinos across the entire 8000-hectare project.   The proposed solution will cast a virtual fence around, and a virtual blanket over, the entire project, allowing the incredible team at BDR to stay one step ahead of the very sophisticated poaching syndicates.  It is  a technology solution that serves as force multiplier, whilst reducing the human element.The proposed solution unfortunately comes at an enormous initial capital cost of US$3 million (ZAR38 million), but will allow BDR to cut their monthly operational costs significantly, rendering the project way more sustainable into the future.  As already mentioned above, after investing over US$100 million of his own savings into his rhinos, and not being able to generate sufficient funding from the sale of horn, John has sadly reached the end of his financial wherewithal to continue funding this project. BDR is therefore looking for you to support the funding of this innovative security solution, so that they can better protect their rhinos.
Please donate now and do your little bit to help in the #WarAgainstPoaching and ensure the longer-term survival of one of the world’s most iconic species.

It goes without saying that you get the obvious satisfaction of playing your part in the prevention of  the extinction of one of the world's most iconic species - the rhino.  
You further get the satisfaction of knowing that every cent of your contribution here will go directly to this specific security solution, which will result in the protection of real live rhinos in the Captive Breeding Operation, that is BDR. 
Then there are the various rewards which allow you to become a much closer part of the BDR family, and which aim to keep you in touch with this amazing project into the future. These range from BDR news letters, to webcam access to live feeds of goings on at the Project, to personal visits hosted by John Hume himself, and where you get to meet the team. 
We hope you agree this is fair return, and that you decide to contribute.If you are not in a position to contribute here, you can still play a really important part in this campaign by simply sharing a link with all of your family, friends, colleagues - in fact anyone you know who might care about saving the rhino. It also helps if you simply talk about what you have read here, and share the real facts about rhino captive breeding projects and rhino horn harvesting. For more information in this regard, go to Facebook or Instagram and follow @RhinoFacts.There is, finally, a unique and innovative CryptoConservation initiative which might interest you outside of this IndieGoGo campaign. Look at RhinoCoin.com for more details. Unfortunately, due to US regulation of crypto markets, this is not an option for US Citizens, but is accessible to everyone else in the world.Managing RhinoThe BDR Project is divided into multiple breeding camps, each about 500ha in size, and housing its own sub-population of rhino. Each camp has a dedicated Camp Master, as well as a Relief Camp Master to cover the period when the Main Camp Master is on leave.  The Camp Masters know every rhino in their respective camps intimately, and can identify each rhino from its unique ear notching and habits.  It is their duty to observe and report daily on their respective rhino, and they happily walk tens of kilometers in this endeavor.Each camp is subdivided into 2 sections to allow for rotational grazing to occur. Every spring, just after the first rains of the season, the team close the middle gates and keep the rhinos confined to one section of the camp for approximately 3 months. This allows the grass in the 'rested' half of the camp to go to seed. When all the seed has been shed, the gates are reopened, and for the remaining 9 months the rhinos graze in the full expanse of their camp. During the winter months, additional supplementary feed is made available for the rhino, to ensure their nutritional requirements are addressed, and to maintain good health through the dry season.  Each camp has several water sources for the rhino, both from natural springs as well as earth-filled dams. Mud baths are provided in all the camps which the rhinos use regularly, especially when it is hot.The natural vegetation in the camps is continually monitored by employing the services of a qualified and experienced Ecologist who conducts fixed point veld (field) condition assessments annually in each of the camps.  These survey results are integrated into the overall BDR Ecological Management Strategy.  BDR further provide for the nutritional requirements of their rhino through extensive and ongoing veld improvement projects, and indigenous trees are routinely planted in the camps to help re-establish the natural ecosystem of the land.  With the added help of a Nutritionist and a full time Wildlife Veterinarian, BDR keep their rhinos in excellent condition.BDR is also spear heading valuable research into rhino, working in close conjunction with both national and international research institutes, to learn more about this iconic species, and they share this knowledge to help other rhino populations.Johnny Hennop, BDR General Manager and some of his Camp Masters and Support StaffBreeding RhinoOver the past 10 years, BDR has successfully grown their herd of rhinos from an initial 250 to 1,626. They are hoping to finally meet their breeding target of 200 rhino calves per year, by the end of this financial year (Feb 2019), and then to sustain this for many years to come.  At the moment BDR have around 300 pregnant female rhino, and are on target to meet this BHAG (big hairy audacious goal).This excellent breeding performance is achieved through establishment of large sub-populations of at least 20-40 founder breeding cows per camp. To adhere to the competition effect, each camp has more than one dominant breeding bull, as well as several sub adult males within the herd, to allow for natural selection by females. All breeding is done 100% naturally without any artificial intervention. To conserve natural social behavior and dynamics, calves and juveniles are allowed to grow up along with their dams (mothers) in their relevant camps.To prevent and reduce the incidence of possible inbreeding, strict records are kept of all matings, matings leading to births, all births, as well as recorded dams and sires. This ensures that proper population dynamics are maintained and managed by way of an up-to-date studbook.Additional land onto which new breeding sub-populations can be established, by relocating sub-adult progeny born to the project, is constantly purchased for habitat expansion. This ensures that sub-adult progeny are removed from their dams and sires, as well as ensuring that the current camps do not exceed their relevant carrying capacities. When rhino are translocated into these new camps, a few are selected from each of the existing breeding camps to ensure the newly established camp has the broadest possible gene pool.   Any bulls not required for mating are housed in dedicated bachelor camps where they will spend the rest of their natural life.The BDR Team recently celebrated two incredible landmark moments for their project which are discussed below.Platimum - BDR's 1000th Rhino BabyMeet Platinum.  He is BDR's 1000th rhino calf born onto the project in the North West Province on 6 April 2018, after 10 years of the project's existence.  He weighed between 50-60kgs at birth and he is doing very well. Gugu - BDR's first F2 progenyMeet Gugu (Zulu for ""precious""). She is the very first ‘second generation’, or F2, calf born onto the BDR Project on 23 May 2018. She was born to 6.5 year old rhino heifer Natalya and rhino bull Griffin (who is incidentally Platinum's elder brother).  Daphne, Gugu's grandmother, arrived at BDR on 21 July 2010, and gave birth to Natalya on Christmas day 2011, 17 months after her arrival.  Horn TrimmingRhino are unique in that, unlike other horned animals, their horns have no boney core, and is comprised primarily of keratin, which is very similar to your own hair or nails. Just like your hair and nails, rhino horn grows back after trimming, at a rate of around 10cm per year. This equates to around 1.5kg of new horn from a male, and 0.75kg from a female, every year.  Rhinos on BDR are routinely trimmed, primarily to render them less attractive to poaching syndicates.  BDR would ideally only like to trim every 2.5 years, but with the insidious poaching crisis underway, it is currently done every 1.8 years per rhino. With their new security system in place (the target of this CrowdFund), BDR hope to be able to extend this trimming interval to as long as 3.5, or even 4 years per rhino.This trimming process is regulated by the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEMBA) (Act No. 10 of 2004) and the Threatened or Protected Species (TOPS) Regulations, 2007. For a rhino horn to be trimmed, a permit must first be acquired from the Department of Nature Conservation. The trimming process then  takes less than 20 minutes per rhino, and is conducted under light sedation and under the supervision of a qualified and experienced Wildlife Veterinarian. The horn is trimmed using an electric saw about 8cm above the growth plate where there is no bone, nerves or blood vessels. It is an entirely painless process as well as non-permanent. In other words, the horn grows back and therefore needs to be routinely trimmed as a poaching deterrent.  The whole process is witnessed by officials, and the horns are immediately removed by professional security firms into safe-custody vaults off the property.BDR has been doing this for the past 10 years and currently has around 6.5 tonnes of stockpiled rhino horn stored in safe custody in vaults around South Africa.Dr Michelle Otto, our Wildlife Veterinarian, with her team trimming hornsRhino OrphanageThe Orphanage on BDR was established to take care of any rhino calves found in distress or at risk of dying. Rhino cows and calves in the camps are monitored very closely by the Camp Masters, and management is alerted as soon as any problems arise. The decision to remove a calf for hand-rearing is never taken lightly as BDR prefer that dams (mothers) raise their own calves, feeding them their own mothers milk. Calves on BDR, however,  can be removed for any  of the following reasons, to give them a fighting chance of survival:
Weak calves;
Calves from mothers that die from natural causes or poaching;
Nutrition deprived calves, where perhaps the mother's milk has dried up;
Injured calves;
Abandoned calves;
Calves separated from their mothers and who fail to reunite; and
Calves from mothers who have a record of not raising their calves to adulthood.
The Orphanage facility consists of a building that has a kitchen for preparation of milk, temperature controlled rooms where very young and sick calves are cared for and medical care can be administered, some store rooms, 6 smaller rhino camps, and 5 larger rhino camps. All calves are started on teated 2l cool-drink bottles to teach them to suckle well.   From there they progress to the special bucket-bottles seen in the picture below. The youngest calves are fed every two hours around the clock, and from two weeks this can be changed to every 3 hours.  As they grow older, night feeds are reduced and duration between feeds is extended.  Calves are weaned off both milk and human contact from 16 to 18 months, but remain in the Orphanage until they are about 3.5 to 4 years old and have enough confidence to be re-integrated back into one of the breeding camps.Feeding time in the OrphanageAn important principle practiced by the BDR Orphanage is to ensure that these rhinos do not see humans as companions.

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>According to ""The Water Project""
in 2008 about 5 million people in South Africa alone lacked access to water and 15 million lacked access to basic sanitation. The Global Water Partnership  states that ""every year 3 million people die prematurely from water-related diseases 
in developing countries. (<a href=""http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/wwdr/wwdr3/pdf/WWDR3_Water_in_a_Changing_World.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UNWWDR3 p.12</a>) "" <br/></p>
<p>There are 154 developing countries. <br/></p>
<p>If you don't live in a developing country, you may think that water resource awareness is not a problem your country faces, but the organization also reports that ""1/3 of the world’s population lacks sufficient access to safe drinking water and sanitation to meet their basic needs (<a href=""http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/wwdr/wwdr3/pdf/WWDR3_Water_in_a_Changing_World.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pacific Institute 2007 in UNWWDR3 p.36</a>)."" </p>

<p>This is going to be an extremely challenging and exciting adventure, but more

We will be educated in the area of water resource management and how to facilitate activities to raise awareness of the subject. <br/>
</div></div>","Short Summary:Using a means of an extreme adventure trip the Treverton grad students  are able to have contact time with learners at various underprivileged and under resourced rural schools in Northern Zululand, South Africa. This is a remote regions in South Africa  and we will be sharing knowledge and environmental lessons with the learners students about better looking after the precious natural resource - WATER. Many households in the villages don't have running water and rely on rain water 

reservoirs (those who can afford them!), the village tap or collection straight from rivers. People's health (see statistics below) is  dependent on correct management practices of the water catchment areas.  This is the message of our interactive, fun and curriculum related lessons will help teach. The journey, spanning over multiple
days, will involve a combination
of paddling, mountain biking, and hiking. We
will stay in community stays (i.e. overnight with members of the community),
practicing responsible, sustainable tourism. 


Purpose:
The purpose of this expedition is to
raise awareness of the importance of managing the limited natural resource –
water. We will be visiting some of the local under- resourced schools, engaging
with them about the importance of environmental issues, particularly those that
affect the quality of the water resource and the health of the community
members (e.g. habitat degradation, proper sanitization, litter, good hygiene
habits).  We will also invite teachers from these schools to attend a teacher training workshop, run by the Treverton's Environmental Education Trainer Mrs Janet Snow. This will help ensure the sustainability and longevity of such a project in addition that this is the second time the post matric students we are going to be visiting these schools (see below under Previous

The option for people who live in slums, the majority of whom are women and children, is to burn or simply dump their trash on the streets. 
Our non-profit organization, SiKanda has been working with at-risk communities in Oaxaca since 2008. For families in these areas, a worm composting solution that processes organic waste will improve health and sanitation while also providing income and restoring dignity.
Mothers, children, and the elderly who live in slums are particularly vulnerable to waste accumulation. According to the United Nations, garbage accumulation increases diarrheal diseases, which occupy the second place in the factors that increase world and particularly child mortality. 
But waste CAN be turned into compost, because most of trash in poor neighborhoods is ORGANIC!
The Impact
We believe collaboration is fundamental to improving lives in marginalized communities. With this in mind, SiKanda has been laying the groundwork for a cooperative worm-composting center to be founded in 2012. The Worm Composting Center of Oaxaca (WCCO) will provide continuous, hands-on training in worm composting for families, schools and communities who live in marginalized neighborhoods. 
How it Works
Organic waste is produced by neighborhoods with little or no access to waste collection services. The simple process of collecting the trash will directly benefit at least 2,000 people. Their waste will be transferred to the WCCO where it will be placed in large bed structures and red worms will feed on it. 
The equation is simple, but powerful: Trash + Worms = Organic Fertilizer. The fertilizer generated can then be used for growing vegetables or for cash sale. In the first year alone, the center plans to train 8,000 people and foster vermiculture as a micro business for 200 families. 
The Worm Composting Center of Oaxaca will also train other communities to replicate the model of processing organic waste for fertilizer production. The educational programs at the center will ""pay forward,"" encouraging sustainability in these areas and in successive generations.
What We Need & What You Get
SiKanda has obtained 70% of the funds to set up the WCCO, most of which come from the support of Halloran Philanthropies. In order to complete the construction of the WCCO and implement its educational programs, we need to raise $15,000. Half of this money will go toward construction materials, and the other half will provide educational materials, hand tools, and staff wages. The WCCO is designed to be self-sustaining and only requires a one-time donation.
Depending on the level of your contribution, we are pleased to offer you several gifts from Oaxaca including: SiKanda’s feature-length documentary about the lives of people living in landfills (Pepenadores); a booklet of recycling secrets; an inscription of your name on our wall of fame in the WCCO, and Oaxacan greeting cards.  
Other Ways You Can Help
Please tell your friends, family and co-workers about SiKanda's important work with the Pepenadores and the families who live in slums. You can host a party or organize a fundraising event in your community to raise money and awareness for our programs.

</div></div>","“Help Build the Ark” is not just a project… It’s a future.
That is what I’m going to be exploring and sharing through social media through out 2011. Musicians tell stories through music. For artists it is their chosen art medium. For me it is social media, photos, video, audio, updates, conversations and digital engagement. It is going to explore the green philosophy and project it at the reality of today’s technology and power consumption.

Leading up to this…
For four years I have been making social media. It's time to bring all my knowledge and passion together for an “EPIC WIN” project. The genuinely heartfelt value comes from the delivery mechanism; Social Media, and most importantly the Social bit. 
… I want to share this year with the world. Phil’s Story
My life has been having a life reboot here in the UK and while I still have not got where I need to go I have certainly put things in alignment to go in the direction that I want to go.  After making lots of kneejerk reactions about careers, home life and love - I lost all three.  The contract I had went, then the relationship and then the house.  I’m homeless officially.
I currently see my daughter, Bella every weekend.   It's been hard but it did wake something up inside of me to not only sort out some personal character issues I had but also at the same time look at the overall big picture in the tech scene.  Having been online since 1989 and onwards via Fidonet and bulletin board systems I’m as old-skool as they come.

How did it come to this!
In April/May 2010 I made the judgement that I would chase my dream of setting up a fibre streaming web studio.  I had done some very early vlogging shows on blip.tv in standard definition but I was never happy with them and I always had a problem with getting the stream to be stable on my terrible ASDL service in the location I lived.
I started to travel over to Nottingham to drum up work to try and pay the arrears on the house that I alone was living in. (see my story above!) I had my daughter at the time 3 days a week and things were ok until bills started to mount up.  The house was repossessed at the end of October.

Luckily I have been staying in spare rooms across Nottingham while I chase my dream of building up the web studio for live web streaming.  Shortly after getting to Nottingham I found some work with the help of another social media practitioner Caron Lyon (@pcmcreative) and we started working on projects together. Without the help of Caron and her partner Dan I would have never managed to get the studio into the present condition it stands in today.  

On the way up
The very first social media project we did was for Architects Journal and their coverage of Nottingham University’s eco H.O.U.S.E (Home Optimising the Use of Solar Energy) entry to the 2010 Solar Decathlon in February 2010. 20 countries entered and the UK entrant came from Nottingham. Our social media project was a success and a good promotional opportunity. We made some great eco foundation connections.
New HorizonsIt was around this time I started to think about breaking up my time each month to spend half a month on client retainers and the other half building up the studio, the output and ultimately look around for a new kind of life/stable home without the massive price tag.

Enter the Living Ark.I met Kristina at an ethics show in London and after interviewing her and loving the product so much I asked them if I could get onboard to do social media with them.  They agreed and three months later with some small email campaigns, videos and interviews done we moved onto something much bigger…  Moved on to… crowd-source purchasing the materials, labour and wiring for a livingARK and conceived a project to live broadcast for 365 days.
This is not a Big Brother or Get Me Out of Here type reality show. Its coverage from an outdoor stream of the building, switching to internal shots and following me throughout the days while doing social media community projects in and around Nottingham. Business as usual really but I will have a home to call my own and my own front door key.
Social Media, Technology and Eco?Linking up the ark with my ongoing social media content on a daily basis will see my transition of my old life to a new, more optimize green one within a ‘zero carbon footprint living roof ark’.   I’ll blog, document and a few days a week give my daughter a more solid stable home whilst teaching her all about living more sustainably.  It’s not going to be an instant switch, things never are but I’ll do my upmost to learn new things and aim to start growing my own food.

I’ll experiment with new smart grids and technology reporting back about how long solar and the wind turbines last.  I’ll be bringing in green community users every week, looking at the Ark itself and I'll have a macro community looking after the green roof.  That’s where you can get involved, as your sponsorship money will have its very own real estate!

It is not Big Brother or I’m a celebrity but I do have tasks!I'll become tour guide for the local eco buildings probably - for the 365 days I'll be living onsite in the Ark learning how to change my life to live more greener, more sustainably and learn about all new kinds of optimized technology.

And Finally…The Ark will have a legacy at the campus after as well and we will look at what to do next with it at the end of that year.  I'll be writing and documenting the process in the hope to write a book about my experiences as a social media maker and how the transition is changing the way I live and interact with the world.

Onwards and UpwardsMy ultimate intention during the course of the year is to fine-tune my own social media making skills. I’d like to find a role that will generate an income to purchase my own Ark so I can leave something for my daughter in the future - this is about me making a statement of love to my daughter more than the actual building and project. I want her to know that her daddy tried to change his ways and loved her more than any bricks and mortar could ever offer.  To leave a legacy carved in wood for her and her children in the future.

So…My Calls to Action for you… your mission should you accept it…It’s simple really; you’ve read this far! I’m guessing you must be interested. I’m asking for you to help me crowd source the finances to realise this special project. Collectively we all want to make differences and optimize what we have left around the world. I want to make people change the way they approach energy and eco.  We cannot just fix things over night but we can start to try.  I’m not gonna stop flying overnight (in fact I’ve recently beeing to Boston to speak to some friends about helping me with a nudge about my project) but I can start to make subtle differences and I know me pushing out content daily about the Ark and the energy consumption tied in with energy partners feedback and live Q&A sessions will be a fantastic year round social media output.

Over to you and your money!we need $20,000 to make this part happen.
we actually need £25,000k gbp but i just feel that is not achievable in the time we have - i'm looking that we can get a company to match it after they see the hard work we put in to make this happen.   I created “31 days of December” (helpbuildtheark.com) an hour and half of video footage in three minute or less clips about the ark.  These were released daily through december of 2010. 
It is important to me that you have a fully rounded idea of the ark project.I'm chasing grants like a mad man and I have given myself 50 days to make this happen.  I’m 38 in January.  I want to be living this lifestyle completely by the time I'm forty.  I've never been as more clear about anything in all my life.  

This is also a legacy project, my daughters and my future in the digital online social media space for mine and her generation - a lesson in humanity and optimising end to end the power usage we use on a day to day basis - educating my daughter in the early years of her life so she has a solid foundation in all of the things that the ark and the experience will offer.

</h4>
<div>    The vision for this project was born from the strong realization that our current paradigm is lacking a crucial regenerative property that exists in all aspects of nature.  Consumption rates are at an all time high; and with high consumption, comes much waste and pollution.  As this waste accumulates, we are confronted with a variety of toxins that eventually make their way into our soil and water.</div>
<div>    In nature, we find the key player in the cycle of processing and converting such toxins into usable materials to be the mushroom.  Fungi are the major decomposers of our planet; they break down matter which would otherwise not be recycled, and turn them into a fresh and fertile substrate that plants, insects and animals can thrive on.  It is our goal to form a partnership with fungi to achieve such results in relation to our soil and water.         </div>

</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p>   </p>
<p>For thousands of years, ancient cultures have revered mushrooms for their health benefits, culinary value, and the sacred experience that some can invoke.  Fungi contain some of the most potent, natural medicine on the planet, and are known to possess supernatural healing qualities in many eastern traditions.  </p>
<p>   Of the estimated 140,000 species of mushroom-forming fungi, science is familiar with only 10 percent, according to world-renown mycologist <a href=""http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/06/10/6-ways-mushrooms-can-save-the-world.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paul Stamets</a>, who has written several books on this fascinating topic.  Paul is also responsible for much of the research regarding the remedial properties of fungi, and how we can apply them to our current situation of environmental degradation.  <br/></p>
<p>In his book, ""Mycelium Running,"" Stamets highlights the many functions and behaviors of mushrooms.  Some species hyperaccumulate heavy metals such as radioactive isotopes Cesium-134 and 137, mercury, lead and arsenic among others. They digest and/or trap several pathogens, including malaria! They also digest pesticides, estrogen-based pharmaceuticals, dioxins, dyes and petroleum hydrocarbons. Some of which are found in run-off from CAFOs (concentrated animal feeding operations) and other industrial farming operations. The list can be further expanded and is only growing. This, to us, indicates HUGE, exciting potential. <br/><br/><i>“In God, every end is converted into a new means.

It could be debated that water is the main transportation device of biological systems on a global and cellular level.  All life on this planet needs water. We believe, through cleaning water, we are helping to clean every facet of life.<p>   We are all impacted by pollution, whether you know it or not.  Water from streams used to be drinkable, swimmable, and generally safe to enjoy.  We are now confronted with the fact that our levels of consumption have compromised the natural world, and our waterways are no longer the life-giving bodies that they once were. Soil no longer provides for the diversity of life when it is over-farmed and soaked with toxic chemicals.  These issues seem daunting, and many would choose to ignore them for the comfort of complacency, but we believe that nature has equipped us with the tools necessary to restore our planet to the abundant paradise that it once was.  We also believe that the potential for a healthy, symbiotic and balanced life are within the grasp of each individual, and every community.</p>

</div></div>","Our story:

    The vision for this project was born from the strong realization that our current paradigm is lacking a crucial regenerative property that exists in all aspects of nature.  Consumption rates are at an all time high; and with high consumption, comes much waste and pollution.  As this waste accumulates, we are confronted with a variety of toxins that eventually make their way into our soil and water.
    In nature, we find the key player in the cycle of processing and converting such toxins into usable materials to be the mushroom.  Fungi are the major decomposers of our planet; they break down matter which would otherwise not be recycled, and turn them into a fresh and fertile substrate that plants, insects and animals can thrive on.  It is our goal to form a partnership with fungi to achieve such results in relation to our soil and water.         
                               
                                 The crew so far..

       Brett Scott                                                                   Eric Henry                                                      
""Through sustainably growing gourmet and medicinal mushrooms with/for our community, we seek to initiate and maintain various (mycorestoration) projects amongst native waterways.  By doing so, we hope to discover how to live in a deeply abundant and symbiotic relationship with our only home, planet Earth.""
                         -SWF Mission statement                  
                    Why mushrooms?


   
For thousands of years, ancient cultures have revered mushrooms for their health benefits, culinary value, and the sacred experience that some can invoke.  Fungi contain some of the most potent, natural medicine on the planet, and are known to possess supernatural healing qualities in many eastern traditions.  
   Of the estimated 140,000 species of mushroom-forming fungi, science is familiar with only 10 percent, according to world-renown mycologist Paul Stamets, who has written several books on this fascinating topic.  Paul is also responsible for much of the research regarding the remedial properties of fungi, and how we can apply them to our current situation of environmental degradation.  
In his book, ""Mycelium Running,"" Stamets highlights the many functions and behaviors of mushrooms.  Some species hyperaccumulate heavy metals such as radioactive isotopes Cesium-134 and 137, mercury, lead and arsenic among others. They digest and/or trap several pathogens, including malaria! They also digest pesticides, estrogen-based pharmaceuticals, dioxins, dyes and petroleum hydrocarbons. Some of which are found in run-off from CAFOs (concentrated animal feeding operations) and other industrial farming operations. The list can be further expanded and is only growing. This, to us, indicates HUGE, exciting potential. “In God, every end is converted into a new means. Thus the use of commodity, regarded by itself, is mean and squalid.” ― Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nature 


It could be debated that water is the main transportation device of biological systems on a global and cellular level.  All life on this planet needs water. We believe, through cleaning water, we are helping to clean every facet of life.   We are all impacted by pollution, whether you know it or not.  Water from streams used to be drinkable, swimmable, and generally safe to enjoy.  We are now confronted with the fact that our levels of consumption have compromised the natural world, and our waterways are no longer the life-giving bodies that they once were. Soil no longer provides for the diversity of life when it is over-farmed and soaked with toxic chemicals.  These issues seem daunting, and many would choose to ignore them for the comfort of complacency, but we believe that nature has equipped us with the tools necessary to restore our planet to the abundant paradise that it once was.  We also believe that the potential for a healthy, symbiotic and balanced life are within the grasp of each individual, and every community.

     By investing in this project, you are helping us to create a model that could very well change the planet, transforming our relationship with the environment as a whole.We hope to spark a regenerative trend that will eventually be present in all business models, with Earth and biology as a priority.


     Laetiporus Sulphureus:  The Chicken of the Woods   

                                  How it works:


There's a fairly simple process that we use to propagate mushrooms indoors. Here's a little breakdown of what's involved: 

             
   We start with a liquid culture of a particular strain, in this case we are growing the Elm Oyster.  The liquid is carefully inoculated via syringe into a jar containing pasteurized rye grain; this begins the first step of the 'spawn run' stage of growth.         
   A week later, we transfer the colonized grain into a  bag of enriched, pasteurized sawdust for the second stage of the spawn run.  Using different mediums in the spawn run stage gives the fungi a metabolic advantage, as well as a wide range of nutrients to consume throughout it's growth.

                    Another week goes by, and we are ready to transfer the colonized sawdust into our fruiting bags, which contain a mixed medium of thrashed wheat straw, locally sourced coffee grounds and hardwood chips that have been pasteurized beforehand.  After carefully transferring the mycelium into the fruiting bags, they are moved into a dark room to finish spawning; and a few weeks later, can be moved into an environment that is conducive for fruiting. This is the stage that produces the wholesome mushrooms we all love.           

From here we can use the ""spent"" mycelial cakes to create mushroom compost and more importantly, employ this ""acclimated spawn"" in our bioremediation projects. 




    
Where the funding goes:   
As simple as this process is, there is a significant margin for error, and a risk of contamination while working in the small space that we have.  We are reaching out to the community to support us in making this process more organized and efficient, so that we can have room to grow this vision, as well as provide space to initiate and maintain restoration projects.  

The donations contributed will help us expand and acquire certain tools and materials such as:  a small structure for spawning/fruiting, ventilation and climate control equipment, spawning containers, fruiting containers, substrates, supplements and various lab equipment.  Any extra proceeds will go directly towards our mycorestoration projects.

   

By helping us attain these small goals, we can assure that the community is provided with an abundant and consistent harvest of healthy and organically grown mushrooms, educational resources to expand our knowledge of the fungi kingdom, and a sustainable business model for a brighter future!  In addition to providing food for this region, we will also be channeling our efforts into creating a variety of restoration projects aimed at removing toxins from industrial farm run-off by  installing ""myco-filters""  to digest or trap any pollutants that may be contaminating the soil and water.


  
Can't Donate? No worries!


We understand that funds are tight for many of us these days, but there are some other ways you can help us manifest this vision!  
Word of mouth is still a crucial means of communicating!  As much time 
as we spend on computers and devices, it's still highly effective to 
reach out and talk to your peers.  Help spread the word about SweetWater
 Fungi by bringing us up in conversation and directing folks to our 
Facebook page: HERE
Do you use Facebook?  Give us a 'like', and share the status of our 
campaign with your friends and family.  We will be updating often, and 
providing information on wild, edible and medicinal fungi for anyone and everyone wishing to be closer to these wonderful allies.
  This has been a hobby for us for some time, and is rewarding in many ways; but recently we have become aware of a greater potential to this work.  Now, we seek to expand and sustain this vision into a more serious endeavor that will benefit the environment, and the community.  With industrial practices impending on our own waterways, we feel personally convicted to offer solutions in this time of need. 
Blessings and gratitude!   Sincerely, The Sweetwater Fungi team

<h2>Our Story<br/>
</h2>
<p>NEST is an all-volunteer group of self-organizing, tree-climbing humans. We take on a role as canopy surveyors, who utilize the Northwest Forest Plan’s “Survey and Manage” laws to protect ancient forests threatened by clearcut logging.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>""Survey and Manage"" laws protect the endangered species in Oregon's forests.  Endangered species need habitat to survive, so if you find an endangered critter, the trees that it lives in cannot be cut.  The Red Tree Vole and The Marbled Murrelet live in trees that are 150-400 years old, so we are trying to keep the oldest forests in the country standing.  Only 4% of Oregon's old growth forest remains after decades of heavy logging.  NEST, as well as many Oregonians, know that there is nothing like an ancient forest, the mammoth trunks and hanging green moss are a sight to behold.  These forests are home to many species of owl, bear, salmon, bird, snake, frog, and deer.  Unfortunately, the managers of these precious ecosystems still try to clearcut them.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>NEST formed in response to this phenomenon in 1998, when several observant forest defenders noticed paid USFS surveyors climbing trees. These paid surveyors were seeking the treetop nests of red tree voles. Unfortunately, their abstract survey protocol does not fully account for tree vole habitat, and it is not ideal for finding nests.<br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Under Survey and Manage, each red tree vole nest documented was required to receive a 10-acre surrounding buffer where no logging could occur. Following a little research, the forest defenders realized just what needed to be done to do a much more thorough job, on their own.  They went out to the woods to do the surveys themselves.<br/></p>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>
</h2>
<p>We are trying to raise $2,000 for this summer and beyond.  A large portion of that money will go to gas.  We have to drive anywhere from 1-4 hours, depending where NEST is currently located, and gas is very expensive these days!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We also need to buy new climbing ropes ($300+ each) and a new compound bow (which can cost up to $700).  We use bows to shoot climbing lines into the tops of the trees, and then climbing harnesses to ascend the rope into the canopy.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The community of Eugene, OR is very supportive of us.  Local businesses donate most of the food we eat throughout the summer because they know how important our work is.  In Oregon, the forest belongs to everyone, but not everybody has time to fight for it.  But we are still in need of money for gas and gear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE AS NEST IS A 501c3 NON-PROFIT.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For donations of $20 you will receive:<br/></p>
<p>A monthly e-newsletter, informing you of NEST's successes, locations, and adventures.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story

NEST is an all-volunteer group of self-organizing, tree-climbing humans. We take on a role as canopy surveyors, who utilize the Northwest Forest Plan’s “Survey and Manage” laws to protect ancient forests threatened by clearcut logging.

""Survey and Manage"" laws protect the endangered species in Oregon's forests.  Endangered species need habitat to survive, so if you find an endangered critter, the trees that it lives in cannot be cut.  The Red Tree Vole and The Marbled Murrelet live in trees that are 150-400 years old, so we are trying to keep the oldest forests in the country standing.  Only 4% of Oregon's old growth forest remains after decades of heavy logging.  NEST, as well as many Oregonians, know that there is nothing like an ancient forest, the mammoth trunks and hanging green moss are a sight to behold.  These forests are home to many species of owl, bear, salmon, bird, snake, frog, and deer.  Unfortunately, the managers of these precious ecosystems still try to clearcut them.

NEST formed in response to this phenomenon in 1998, when several observant forest defenders noticed paid USFS surveyors climbing trees. These paid surveyors were seeking the treetop nests of red tree voles. Unfortunately, their abstract survey protocol does not fully account for tree vole habitat, and it is not ideal for finding nests.



Under Survey and Manage, each red tree vole nest documented was required to receive a 10-acre surrounding buffer where no logging could occur. Following a little research, the forest defenders realized just what needed to be done to do a much more thorough job, on their own.  They went out to the woods to do the surveys themselves.

The Impact







Since this time, NEST has found hundreds of Red Tree Vole nests in areas that were slated for logging. Thousands of acres of forest have been saved, as a result of NEST surveys.







Timber sales that have been canceled, largely due to NEST surveys, include the Clark Timber Sale (site of the Fall Creek Tree-sit), Straw Devil (site of a years-long occupation), and others.







Forest preservationists have very few tools to work with, and NEST is the most direct way we have found to confront forest management agencies and logging companies.  They may not listen when people hold signs outside their offices, but they cannot ignore good documentation of endangered species.







NEST has surveyed everywhere from the Illinois Valley of Southern Oregon, as far north as the Mt. Hood National Forest, and many sites in between. Some timber sales surveyed include Althouse Sucker, Anderson West, Deer Creek, Boney Skull, Cow Catcher, Trapper, and many others.







We hope to climb in many more!

What We Need & What You Get

We are trying to raise $2,000 for this summer and beyond.  A large portion of that money will go to gas.  We have to drive anywhere from 1-4 hours, depending where NEST is currently located, and gas is very expensive these days!

We also need to buy new climbing ropes ($300+ each) and a new compound bow (which can cost up to $700).  We use bows to shoot climbing lines into the tops of the trees, and then climbing harnesses to ascend the rope into the canopy.

The community of Eugene, OR is very supportive of us.  Local businesses donate most of the food we eat throughout the summer because they know how important our work is.  In Oregon, the forest belongs to everyone, but not everybody has time to fight for it.  But we are still in need of money for gas and gear.
 
DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE AS NEST IS A 501c3 NON-PROFIT.

For donations of $20 you will receive:
A monthly e-newsletter, informing you of NEST's successes, locations, and adventures.

$50 or more:
e-newsletter plus a handmade patch with the NEST logo

$100 or more:
e-newsletter + patches + a NEST t-shirt

$250 or more:
e-newsletter + patches + t-shirt + a NEST sweatshirt in your size

$500 or more:

Get yours before we run out!                                       Without bees to pollinate fruit trees, there would be no cherry pie. Without bees to pollinate vegetable gardens, there’d be no tomatoes.Without bees to pollinate almond trees, there’d be no almond butter. The list is so long that without bees to pollinate your food, more than 1/3 of what you eat and drink would be gone. Problem: Most farmers depend on a single type of bee to pollinate our food and that bee, the honey bee, is struggling. Honey bees and local farmers need your help.Solutions: There are 4,000 types of native bees in North America whose only job is to pollinate fruits, vegetables and nuts. Join the pollinator movement today! You can release a few native bees in your garden, raise gentle bees in your backyard or support someone else who is raising bees. Contribute: Keep your favorite foods on the table by contributing today to make sure there are enough bees to get the job done.             5 Easy Ways You Can Help 
Contribute $25

Release Native Bees in Your Own Garden


Raise Native Bees Local Farmers Can Use


Support Someone Who Raises Native Bees


Ask a Friend to Join the Pollination Revolution


What’s cool about native bees is that they’re super pollinators:


They don’t make honey, they just pollinate things.
It takes just 400 mason bees to pollinate 100 fruit trees. It takes about 30,000 honey bees to do the same job.
They gentle-natured and only sting in self-defense, so they’re safe around children and pets,
They’re easy to keep in your garden. You don’t need a hive or fancy equipment, just a “bee house” that you hang like a bird feeder.



    




The BeeWithMe Network

Whether you are
releasing or raising native bees, we want to provide an easy-to-use tool that
unites bee lovers and food lovers. Our goal is to teach people how to
raise native bees and connect them with other backyard beekeepers who are
already doing it. In the beta-version of
BeeWithMe.net, you’ll find a simple concept that points to the potential.
Here is what you can do on BeeWithMe:


Participate: Raise bees and connect with others.


Learn: Receive garden tips, learn bee-safe best practices and find resources and mentors to ensure your success.


Share: Pin your bee house location on the interactive map and see the farms where your excess bee cocoons are being rehomed.


Communicate: Share and receive bee raising tips, stories and advice.


Bee Rewarded: Download rewards, coupons and obtain badges


Shop: Find local or online stores for bee-safe plants and products



Crown Bees has the vision and ability to start this movement, but you, the Bee Booster, and your community will make it succeed.
                                                         

Crown Bees Founder

The demand for food is increasing, which means we need more bees.
For 20 years, Dave Hunter has been on a mission to solve this problem. He founded Crown Bees, a Seattle -based company that specializes in gentle solitary bees, to diversify the types of bees used to pollinate our crops.
In growing his business, he began developing a small network of people who cared about bees, our food supply and the environment.
At Crown Bees, our first hurdle is to increase public awareness about solitary, native bees – even many experienced gardeners and farmers have never heard of them.


We Need $100,000 To:




Launch a public outreach and education campaign to increase awareness of native bees
Hire a webmaster, a web developer and a graphic designer to create BeeWithMe.net.
Our
$100,000 will build a network of Native Bee Boosters from coast to coast and
develop a new website to support this multi-faceted community.
Encourage people to
raise native bees

Engage Garden Media
Group, the leading public relations firm in the lawn and garden industry, to spread
the word.




Risks
& Challenges
The biggest
risk is not moving fast enough to meet the demands of our future food supply. The good
news is there are many ways to help save bees, even if you don’t want to be a
beekeeper or raise native bees.
Our
biggest challenges are:



Educating people about native bees.


Getting more people to release and raise native bees.

Educating consumers about what
     the food they eat would look like without bees pollinating crops.
Having enough bees to share
     with local farmers to help them continue to grow healthy, local food.

Other
Ways You Can Help
Not
all of us are willing or able to raise bees, but everyone who eats has a
responsibility to help protect our food supply. Here’s what you can do to help: 



Support: Give a Crown Bee house to a
community garden, public park, zoo, botanical garden, local farmer or give one
as a gift. 


Ask: Email your friends and ask
them to join the movement and contribute.


Share: Use Indiegogo Share Tools
to spread the word. Post on social media about how native bees ensure food
security. Use #BeeWithMe #BeeBooster #NativeBees @CrownBees


Change: Let your friends know you
are a Bee Booster by changing your social media profile picture to this photo.

<p>The Borneo Rhythms of Rimba (ROR) Wildlife Festival is the first wildlife-focused festival on the island of Borneo and in Malaysia. </p>
<p>An idea created by 9 guys and girls from very different backgrounds but all of whom share the same love for the town of Sandakan and its amazing Bornean biodiversity. Everyone is doing this on a voluntary basis. The fanciful idea turned into a tangible platform, when we got ourselves registered officially as a society called Future Alam Borneo (FAB) and started bringing together conservationists, scientists, musicians, artists and many more on board this ambitious ride in 2013.</p>
<p>The festival will be a 2 days, outdoor festival held on the fringe of a virgin rainforest reserve, the Rainforest Discovery Centre. We created this platform so that the numerous wildlife, forest and even marine conservation and research materials can be presented to the public as an overview of the natural diversity. From orang utans, to proboscis monkeys, sunbears, pygmy elephants, sumatran rhinos, pangolins and dolphins  and so many more endemic species will hopefully come alive to an audience we hope to attract locally as well as from abroad.  </p>
<p>And to add colour and fireworks to the event, we are bringing in friends who are musicians, artists, dancers, illustrators, and people wholly passionate about the wildlife message, and we intend to turn this into some amazing energy and fun.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/853242/files/20140912204051-ROR_inout.jpg?1410579651"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The dates of the ROR festival  are the 3rd and 4th OCT 2014. </p>
<p>We have spent close to one year raising money from governmental, institutional, corporate bodies and individuals. The core team may just be 9, but it has been a wide-reaching collective effort. </p>
<p>We hope ROR will open people's eyes and inspire them to play a part in conserving biodiversity in some of the oldest rainforests on this planet.</p>
<p>We have in hand 90% of our needed budget to run the festival. But to ensure this doesn't just become a spark which dies out, (we want it to continue annually and grow even bigger), we have decided to reach out internationally for your assistance and your awareness.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/842381/files/20140908081434-RDC_aerial_s.jpg?1410189274"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>CROWDFUNDING.</p>
<p>We are seeking to raise USD9,000 from this campaign. 50% of this target will go towards bridging the outstanding 10% we need to fully cover the 2014 festival costs. The other 50% (USD4,500) and whatever ticket sales we manage to generate will go towards the festival the following year 2015. This first experience has proven raising and generating funds are vital for our own sustainability, and that we should plan and do it way in advance.</p>

</div></div>","Festival Story BACKGROUND
The Borneo Rhythms of Rimba (ROR) Wildlife Festival is the first wildlife-focused festival on the island of Borneo and in Malaysia. 
An idea created by 9 guys and girls from very different backgrounds but all of whom share the same love for the town of Sandakan and its amazing Bornean biodiversity. Everyone is doing this on a voluntary basis. The fanciful idea turned into a tangible platform, when we got ourselves registered officially as a society called Future Alam Borneo (FAB) and started bringing together conservationists, scientists, musicians, artists and many more on board this ambitious ride in 2013.
The festival will be a 2 days, outdoor festival held on the fringe of a virgin rainforest reserve, the Rainforest Discovery Centre. We created this platform so that the numerous wildlife, forest and even marine conservation and research materials can be presented to the public as an overview of the natural diversity. From orang utans, to proboscis monkeys, sunbears, pygmy elephants, sumatran rhinos, pangolins and dolphins  and so many more endemic species will hopefully come alive to an audience we hope to attract locally as well as from abroad.  
And to add colour and fireworks to the event, we are bringing in friends who are musicians, artists, dancers, illustrators, and people wholly passionate about the wildlife message, and we intend to turn this into some amazing energy and fun.  



The dates of the ROR festival  are the 3rd and 4th OCT 2014. 
We have spent close to one year raising money from governmental, institutional, corporate bodies and individuals. The core team may just be 9, but it has been a wide-reaching collective effort. 
We hope ROR will open people's eyes and inspire them to play a part in conserving biodiversity in some of the oldest rainforests on this planet.
We have in hand 90% of our needed budget to run the festival. But to ensure this doesn't just become a spark which dies out, (we want it to continue annually and grow even bigger), we have decided to reach out internationally for your assistance and your awareness.



CROWDFUNDING.
We are seeking to raise USD9,000 from this campaign. 50% of this target will go towards bridging the outstanding 10% we need to fully cover the 2014 festival costs. The other 50% (USD4,500) and whatever ticket sales we manage to generate will go towards the festival the following year 2015. This first experience has proven raising and generating funds are vital for our own sustainability, and that we should plan and do it way in advance.
The festival tickets are sold at USD10 adults and USD3 children, with a large quantity going for free to charities, schools and other non-profit organisations. Ticket sales would only cover about 1/4 of the costs of running, If we sold out.
As a registered society, not only will our financial accounts have to be professionally vetted and submitted for review annually, we are also bound by funds donated to us from our state government and foreign embassies who are supporting us, to give them our financial reports as well.
In supporting us, not only will you be playing a part in educating locals about our natural heritage but the message has international reach, as we are supported in spirit by many people overseas too.
Contributions towards ROR will enable you to put your name on our foundation stone (ok, the website), get images and video from our fest, t-shirts, an exciting illustrated children's book The Wild Treehouse of Borneo, future tickets to ROR and even a place on our 'partners' lists.
All funds contributed will be acknowledged as promised, and if we do not hit our target, any money raised will go towards ensuring the 2015 ROR festival happens, come rain or shine, be it big or small.

We are hoping for an initial audience of around 1500 people, made up of local families, youths, students and international tourists.

<div>
<p>
</p>
<p>The tree is a nitrogen-fixing species and improves
soil fertility - making it an important component to the ecosystem of Tanzania.
The carbon-rich black heart of the tree is uniquely dark because of the
extraordinary amount of carbon absorbed by the tree relative to other types of
trees. Forests are often called the ‘lungs of the earth’ because of the role
they play in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and providing oxygen. <i>The
African Blackwood tree is like a carbon vacuum for the environment. </i></p>
<p></p>
<p>When harvested, the estimated value
of the tree nurseries is over one million U.S. dollars.  The trees are
owned and cared for by the students and staff at each school; schools will use
the value of the harvest to improve infrastructure and the overall educational
environment for their students.</p>

<p>The desire is to create a movement towards more people on the island sharing the bike lanes and getting involved in the 'bike-movement' that is happening on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. We are doing outreach in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li>This will create a launching party for the new safe Bike Lane on King Street in Honolulu with the Mayor Kirk Caldwell supporting by speaking through the pedal-powered system we are bringing from California.</li> <li>Creating a buzz about bikes on the island and the fun of the trip sharing music and culture while getting from point 'a' to 'b' by bicycle, carrying our instruments, speakers, and gear as we go</li>
<li>FINALLY - create the buzz to officially make the Bicycle Music Festival happen in Hawaii in December 2015, which is a $40,000 budget!</li> </ul>
<div>Your contributions will help create a movement that can turn into actualizing less traffic on the H1, safer bike lanes for young and old to enjoy, and a cleaner, more sustainable environment for the future of Hawaii and conscious lifestyles and tourism.

<h3>Privatisierung würde das Leben versiegen lassen</h3>
<p>Wasser ist Leben. Wasser schafft Leben und ist somit eine Grundvoraussetzung für Existenz. Deshalb setze ich mich mit all meinen Möglichkeiten ein, das Wasser für jeden frei zugänglich ist bzw. wieder frei zugänglich gemacht wird. Eine Privatisierung und somit auch ein Kontrolle von<br/> Wasserquellen könnte fatale Folgen haben:<br/><br/></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Wasser wird teurer, sogar unbezahlbar<br/><br/></strong>Leben wie Produktion benötigen sauberes Wasser. Wird Wasser zur Ware, sind beide in Gefahr, denn viele werden sich Wasser bzw. sauberes Wasser nicht mehr leisten können.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Wasser wird künstlich verknappt<br/><br/></strong>Wie jede Handelsware unterliegt Wasser, wenn es gewinnbringend vermarktet wird, den Gesetzen der Marktwirtschaft. Insbesondere künstliche Verknappung ist ein Instrument, mit dem sehr vielen der Zugang zu Wasser versperrt werden kann.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Wasser wird manipuliert<br/><br/></strong>Bereits in den 60er Jahren belegten Versuchsreihen in Amerika, dass durch den Zusatz von Chemikalien (Silberjodid) in der Atmosphäre das Wetter beeinflusst werden kann. Über das Regenwasser wurden sowohl Boden und zeitlich versetzt das Grundwasser stark kontaminiert. Heute nennt man es Chemtrailing, was täglich am Himmel beobachtet werden kann.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>

Privatisierung würde das Leben versiegen lassen
Wasser ist Leben. Wasser schafft Leben und ist somit eine Grundvoraussetzung für Existenz. Deshalb setze ich mich mit all meinen Möglichkeiten ein, das Wasser für jeden frei zugänglich ist bzw. wieder frei zugänglich gemacht wird. Eine Privatisierung und somit auch ein Kontrolle von Wasserquellen könnte fatale Folgen haben:


Wasser wird teurer, sogar unbezahlbarLeben wie Produktion benötigen sauberes Wasser. Wird Wasser zur Ware, sind beide in Gefahr, denn viele werden sich Wasser bzw. sauberes Wasser nicht mehr leisten können.


Wasser wird künstlich verknapptWie jede Handelsware unterliegt Wasser, wenn es gewinnbringend vermarktet wird, den Gesetzen der Marktwirtschaft. Insbesondere künstliche Verknappung ist ein Instrument, mit dem sehr vielen der Zugang zu Wasser versperrt werden kann.


Wasser wird manipuliertBereits in den 60er Jahren belegten Versuchsreihen in Amerika, dass durch den Zusatz von Chemikalien (Silberjodid) in der Atmosphäre das Wetter beeinflusst werden kann. Über das Regenwasser wurden sowohl Boden und zeitlich versetzt das Grundwasser stark kontaminiert. Heute nennt man es Chemtrailing, was täglich am Himmel beobachtet werden kann.


Die Qualität wird schlechterWenn Wartungs- und Erneuerungszyklen zugunsten Gewinnmaximierung keiner geregelten Kontrolle unterliegen, wird die Wasserqualität immer schlechter. Die Folge: Marode Leitungswege, zu erwartende Umweltschäden. Unreines Wasser kann zudem nachhaltige Schäden an den Maschinen erzeugen, die auf Wasser im Herstellungsverfahren angewiesen sind.

<p>A molecular biologist studying herbal medicine and a mexican guy studying permaculture and eco-construction. We decided to start an itinerant project from PANAMA, Chiriqui Province, spreading knowledge (and seeds!) about medical plants use, permaculture and renewable energies in the communities we meet along the way. The idea of a traveling Ecovillage looks as smart as it is in order to keep the project affordable and not invasive for the indigenous culture. Indeed, the core of the project is to promote independence and sustainability in these areas, spreading awareness, ecocreativity, biodiversity and harmony with nature.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT´S THIS ABOUT:</strong></p>
<p>  By using the facilities of local farms and no-profit organizations, the Learning Centre is able to offer several courses and workshops on Herbal and Folkloric medicine, Ecodesign and Eco-construction, Bike Maintainance, Biodiversity, DIY solar panels. Training, practical work sessions on farms and gardens using the resources of the forest according to sustainability principles. This will help the communities to create an alternative job system and life style, promoting independence and decentralization. After an adequate training and a warm-up period, the project will be supported by locals: they will be able to activate and mantain the network independently. It allows the itinerant project to rapidly recycle itself for a new venture.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE ARE HOPING FOR:</strong></p>
<p>  Harmony with the Earth we inhabit, resilience from the modern oil age and decentralization for a better local network..and of course Love and Light for everyone :)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED:</strong></p>
<p>  Simply and clearly we aim to mantain this itinerancy and to avoid any form of property and land occupancy, this would help to be focused on the real purpose and save money! We need basic materials and gardening tools for the permaculture workshops, seeds and materials for building medical plants garden beds, a clayoven and a dehydrator for herbs. Other expenses will be the living costs and books, solar panels and bikes.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>JOIN US:</strong></p>
<p>  You will be able to follow all our courses and workshops online, visiting the existing Ecovillages and Learning Centres and actively partecipate. Our first project would start in Panama, Chiriqui Province, an area enclosed in a rainforest with a pro-active rural community. We will co-operate with ""DESAROLLO RURAL DE PANAMA'"" and will use the facilities around GUALACA VILLAGE. Courses will start as soon as we will reach the goal. </p>

<h2>Campaign purpose:</h2>
<p>My name is Katie Tritsch. I'm a recent graduate of Texas State University - San Marcos. During my last few semesters I founded and served as president for a permaculture student organization called PERMIES. We held many educational meetings, workshops, documentary nights, etc. to spread the word of permaculture!</p>
<p>I wrote an undergraduate thesis entitled, ""<strong>Moving Beyond Sustainability at Institutes of Higher Education: The Potential of a Permaculture Initiative at Texas State</strong>"" which received a lot of positive feedback, including from the folks at UMass Permaculture. <br/>My thesis can be found here: <a href=""https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/4474"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/4474</a></p>
<p>I'm currently helping a dedicated group of young leaders form a <strong>Permaculture Committee at Texas State</strong> and have been invited to give a lightning talk about our initiative's progress at the UMass Permaculture Your Campus Conference this June 23-26. <br/>More about the conference here:<br/><a href=""http://www.umasspermacultureconference.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.umasspermacultureconference.com/</a></p>

<h3>Where does the money go?</h3>
<p>Funding this campaign will allow me to travel from San Marcos, TX to Amherst, MA and back. (About $450 for plane tickets and cab rides, $150 for lodging)</p>
<p>My attendance gives the Permaculture Committee at Texas State a chance to network with other colleges, universities, and permaculturists who can help us ensure our initiative's success. We have found so much support among students, faculty, and staff; nothing could be more meaningful than to share our struggles, strategies, and success stories with others.</p>
<p>If you donate and I DON'T get near my goal funds will go straight to the Permaculture Committee at Texas State and the permaculture garden we will be campaigning for this fall!</p>

Please proliferate this via social media, invite your friends, et cetera.

And if you really want
to be amongst it, join the open source hardware community and start
building your own energy devices.

Other projects:

An
ultra simple to construct, high volume greenhouse:
http://urbangreenhouse.blogspot.com

A non-electrical
cooling system for homes and growing spaces:
http://urbangreenhouse.blogspot.com/2011_03_01_archive.html

And a non-turbine
resonant wind generator, but this remains to be prototyped just yet.

These and other
projects we also hope to promote and develop this summer.

Thank you for your
time, and for all the support received. It makes this fun.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand -- A powerful earthquake struck New Zealand's already-bruised city of Christchurch on Tuesday, collapsing buildings, burying vehicles under debris and sending rescuers scrambling to help trapped people amid reports of multiple deaths.


The 6.3-magnitude quake hit the country's second-biggest city on a busy weekday afternoon and closer to downtown than a major quake that damaged Christchurch last September but caused no deaths when it struck before dawn on a weekend.

Police said there were reports of multiple fatalities from the latest temblor in the city of 350,000, while Prime Minister John Key told Parliament it was still too soon to confirm the deaths.

The quake destroyed the spire of the iconic stone Christchurch Cathedral, which toppled into a central city square, and police said there was a report of two buses crushed under falling buildings.

Video footage showed some multistory buildings collapsed in on themselves, and others with walls that had collapsed into the streets, strewn with bricks and shattered concrete. Sidewalks and roads were cracked and split, and thousands of dazed, screaming and crying residents wandered through the streets as sirens blared. Groups of people helped victims clutching bleedings wounds, and others were carried to private vehicles in makeshift stretchers fashioned from rugs or bits of debris.

</div>
<div>
<h2>What Can You Do? </h2>
<p>We are trying to raise $19,500 to put another 3 ReCabs in service by summer 2013.  For every $6,500 we raise, we will put another ReCab on the road.  All funds will be applied towards the production of more of these eco-friendly cabs.</p>
<p>Here's what your contributions will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,400 - Car Purchase</li>
<li>$1,200 - Paint </li>
<li>$1,000 - Bio Diesel Conversion</li>

THE ELECTRIC SAFARI VEHICLE OF THE FUTURE
Imagine being in a silent safari vehicle
that makes you feel as if you are outside on foot, face to face with a lion, elephant or cheetah.Welcome to Ol Pejeta ConservancyA 90,000
acre home to one hundred endangered black rhino, four of the last seven
northern white rhino in existence, and a sanctuary for predators: lion, leopard
and cheetah.
We believe in conservation you can touch. Ol Pejeta is always
on the lookout for new and better ways to protect the wildlife and environment,
whilst at the same time engaging our 80,000 visitors a year. We want to bridge
the gap between scientist and tourist. 
But it is a constant struggle to balance the wilderness, wildlife and tourists.In the beginning safaris were done on
foot.  Then on horseback.  Then by vehicle.  And there the innovation stopped. Vehicles are vital for getting around but they can be noisy and intrusive.
We believe it is time for change!  Why not vehicles that make the wildlife viewing
experience better and more educational?  Why not vehicles that intrude less on the wildlife, sometimes disrupting predator hunts, depriving them of food?  Why not vehicles with a smaller footprint on
the ground they cross? Why not vehicles with zero emissions into the fresh
air?
Ol
Pejeta has teamed up with the world famous Royal College of Art Vehicle Design
Programme, and with Green Automotive, makers of the first electric Liberty Range
Rover, to create the Safari Vehicle of the Future.The twelve strong team will focus on three
areas for improvement:


VIEWING: creating an improved cabin to
sit in, with an all round, uninterrupted line of sight that makes you feel as
if you are on foot or horseback.  Closer
to nature.


IMPACT: exploring a hybrid
electric-diesel solution that will allow silent safaris with zero emissions,
and which can travel off-road with minimum foot-print.


EDUCATION: enhancing the wealth of fascinating
information about the flora and fauna on view, and the information
being provided by guides.


The Royal College of Art will be developing design ideas for the overall vehicle.  Green Automotive
have kindly agreed to act as electric/hybrid advisors and should funding be
sufficient to also provide production at cost.
We have set the IndieGoGo amount to raise
enough to be able to complete the design and blueprint process: a total of

We would like though to raise a total of
$150,000 so that we can create and operate the first prototype on Ol Pejeta.PLEASE NOTE - IMPORTANT:  Constantly looking for innovative ways to improve conservation and tourism is not easy.  These things can take longer and cost more than initially planned.  Our previous project, a new Aerial Ranger Drone, for example is still underway.  If you would like to support us we will be incredibly grateful and will regularly communicate updates on progress.  Please bear in mind though that you are supporting something new and fresh and it will take time to bear fruits.In the event that we raise more than the design process but less than prototype production then rewards will continue to be honoured and the funds will go towards ongoing conservation innovation on Ol Pejeta.",9.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>My name is Sami and I am the videographer for Paddle Forward.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""> </span>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Fear.</p>
<p>This is what you need to know first: I am frequently afraid. But there’s more. Because I’m also frequently brave.</p>
<p>We all are. We have to be brave because we are all taught and encouraged to be afraid. We live in a society that promotes and profits from fear. Some of us are more entrenched, and more targeted, than others, but we all live in this culture of fear. To survive and thrive, cultures of fear must teach children fears. Fears of strangers, fears of crowds, fears of cities and suburbs, fears of peers and teachers, fears of faces, genders, and darkness. But how many of these fears are rational? How many keep us safe? And from what?</p>
<p>I couldn’t possibly trace all the origins of my courage. Much comes from my family, much from my friends, some even from my cat. But there is one fear, however, that I can distinctly remember choosing to battle: a fear of nature. Such a strange fear, such a strange statement, as if I am not natural, but this is not an uncommon message. Many people are indoctrinated with this dichotomy: indoors or outdoors, rural or urban, wild or tame. </p>
<p>I chose to fight this fear out of necessity. I was at camp and I was miserable. I was scared of the bugs, the owls, the dirt, the rain, the grass, the space, the smells, everything. And I realized, with quite a bit of help, that I was in control of that discomfort. I didn’t need to be afraid. It was a choice, but a choice I’d have never gotten to make if I hadn’t found myself on a camping trip in a downpour in the southern Appalachians.</p>
<p>Almost 15 years later and I’m still afraid of many things. But I refuse to be frightened into submission. I refuse to be bullied. I have made a habit of fighting back. And of encouraging others, particularly children, to fight back too. Eventually, I led the camping trips and when, in the middle of a storm, a child came to me with so much fear, I tried to take that fear gently from his or her hands and replace it with a choice.</p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>So...What does this have to do with Paddling the Mississippi River?</b></h3><p></p>
<p>Well, the trip itself is a rejection of fear. But it is my goal is to take a personal rejection and create a public renouncement.</p>
<p>As we travel downstream, we will be filming. Everything! But in particular, we will be stopping to interview basically anyone we meet along the river about the river. We will talk to the interviewees about the history of the Mighty Mississippi, the legends and the lore. We will talk about the river as a resource then and a resource now, for commerce, irrigation, transportation, sanitation. We will talk about the impact of industry and agriculture and how our current needs will affect future river communities. We will talk about weather and fishing and politics and food. The point is: we will talk.</p>
<p>The best way to dispel fear is to talk about it. </p>
<p>And these are conversations worth having. There are hundreds of thousands of people worth listening to. Everyone, in fact. And though this documentary will cover only a small subset of the populations reliant upon the Mississippi River, it is a start. A beginning. A moment that we can look back on and say, yes, that was the moment that I listened and in that moment, no one was afraid.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p></p>
<p>So the breakdown is pretty simple.  First and foremost, I need to eat.  I’m asking $720 for all of my food expenses.</p>
<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>Food for one day:</p></td>
<td><p>$9</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Food for one week:</p></td>
<td><p>$63</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Food for one month:</p></td>
<td><p>$279</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Food for the whole trip:</p></td>
<td><p><strong>$720</strong></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>While it would be nice if there were no other expenses, there are.  Both myself and my canoe need to come back to Minneapolis in one piece.  The breakdown is as such:</p>
<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>Ship a canoe to Minneapolis</p></td>
<td><p><strong>$130</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Pay for one person to travel back to the Twin Cities</p></td>
<td><p><strong>$150</strong></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>                                                                         </strong><em>Total Trip Cost:        <strong>$1,000</strong></em></p>

So...What does this have to do with Paddling the Mississippi River?
Well, the trip itself is a rejection of fear. But it is my goal is to take a personal rejection and create a public renouncement.
As we travel downstream, we will be filming. Everything! But in particular, we will be stopping to interview basically anyone we meet along the river about the river. We will talk to the interviewees about the history of the Mighty Mississippi, the legends and the lore. We will talk about the river as a resource then and a resource now, for commerce, irrigation, transportation, sanitation. We will talk about the impact of industry and agriculture and how our current needs will affect future river communities. We will talk about weather and fishing and politics and food. The point is: we will talk.
The best way to dispel fear is to talk about it. 
And these are conversations worth having. There are hundreds of thousands of people worth listening to. Everyone, in fact. And though this documentary will cover only a small subset of the populations reliant upon the Mississippi River, it is a start. A beginning. A moment that we can look back on and say, yes, that was the moment that I listened and in that moment, no one was afraid.


What We Need 

So the breakdown is pretty simple.  First and foremost, I need to eat.  I’m asking $720 for all of my food expenses.


Food for one day:
$9


Food for one week:
$63


Food for one month:
$279


Food for the whole trip:
$720


While it would be nice if there were no other expenses, there are.  Both myself and my canoe need to come back to Minneapolis in one piece.  The breakdown is as such:


Ship a canoe to Minneapolis
$130


Pay for one person to travel back to the Twin Cities
$150


                                                                         Total Trip Cost:        $1,000
What You Get


$25 – A HUGE hug and a postcard from somewhere along the river. My standard hug is pretty big, so just be prepared. Also lots of karma points.
$50 – A shout-out to you or your organization on our Twitter and Facebook with a picture of me featuring your name or company. Plus a HUGE hug and a postcard from somewhere along the river. And a canoe-full of karma points.
$100 – Your name will be featured in the credits of our documentary. This could be your big break! Plus A HUGE hug, a postcard, and a photo shout-out, and a multitude of karma points.
$250 – A Paddle For Change t-shirt. Who doesn't love a good t-shirt?? Plus A GIGANTIC hug, a postcard, your name featured in the credits of our documentary, and a photo shout-out. And feel free to give yourself pats on the back at any time.
$500 - A copy of our finished documentary! Show it to your friends! Plus a Paddle For Change t-shirt, your name in the credits of our documentary, a photo shout-out, a postcard, a hug, and as many karma points as I can summon from the universe.
$1,000 – A copy of the finished documentary, a photo shout-out, a Paddle For Change t-shirt, your name in the credits of our documentary, a postcard, THE BIGGEST hug, and my eternal gratitude. And I will wish happy things for you for all of my birthday wishes from here on out.

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<div>Site 3 Colaboratory is housed in a unique building. Many decades ago it was a horse stable. Before Site 3 came along, it was a blacksmith shop. As a result, it never got connected to the city sewage and water lines. </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461770291/Site_3_xukn1t.png"" src="""" style=""width: 397.491px;height: 248px;""/></p>And now the city is making it prohibitively expensive to do so. But Site 3 is a busy place, and it needs a bathroom. So currently, the makerspace uses ""fire toilets"" to incinerate people's waste, and sends the ashes and smells up a smoke stack. It's just as unpleasant as it sounds.</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461853209/Fire_toilet_w_smoke_o89mqt.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 460.115px;height: 259px;""/></p></div>
<div>Being an environmentally-minded person, I was not enthused by this idea. And Site 3's members are tired of the fire toilets constantly breaking down, or scaring away would-be members.</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461772381/Infographic_-_OFR_yrzbuw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 287.735px;height: 336px;""/></p></div>With every problem, there comes an opportunity. I had joined Site 3 in order to build a technology that could convert organic waste into renewable energy &amp; fertilizer, without ever leaving the building where it was produced. </div><div><br/></div><div>
<p>Soon I realized this was the perfect solution to Site 3's toilet problem. Instead of trying to connect to the city infrastructure, we could combine my technology with grey-water recycling and rainwater collection, to make the bathroom completely self-sustaining and ""zero waste."" Site 3 would become a small island of sustainability in the middle of downtown Toronto.</p>
<p>I hope you will join us in embarking on this pioneering project.

<p><b>Phase 1: Toilet &amp; running water (Flush)</b></p>
<p>The basic system will include installing a low-flow toilet, waterless urinal and sink. Two IBC tote tanks will be installed below the bathroom, one to hold fresh water to supply the system, and one for ""black water,"" aka toilet waste. The fresh water tank will initially be filled with a hose from a friendly neighbor's house, and the black water tank will be pumped out by a honey truck through a port in the wall of Site 3. We aim to complete Phase 1 by mid-May, allowing members to start using the bathroom ASAP. The materials for this initial phase will cost about $1,800.</p>
<p><b>Phase 2: Anaerobic digester, grey water recycling and rainwater collection (Recycle)</b></p>
<p>The anaerobic digester will be made from a water heater tank, and will require a heat exchanger to keep it's temperature at 55 degrees Celsius for 10-15 days in order to fully digest and eliminate all pathogens. It will reduce the volume of solids from the black water by another 50-75%, and convert it into useful byproducts: biogas and fertilizer. Anaerobic bacteria are finicky, so the entire system will require a series of sensors and controls to ensure that all the parameters required to keep the system working are being optimized. In total, this part of the system will cost about $2,200.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461773174/Water_heater_digester_diagram_with_images_vejcst.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 318.435px;height: 302px;""/></p>
<p>The grey water recycling system, which will treat water from the sink only, will consisting of eight buckets in two parallel rows. The bucket system will include a) settling tank, b) anaerobic sludge blanket, c) bio-membrane filter and d) a second bio-membrane filter. Finally, the water will run through a UV filter before it returns to the fresh water tank. This part of the system is relatively inexpensive, except for the UV filter. The total cost comes to about $700, with nearly half that going to the UV filter (they're expensive). The <a href=""http://biorealis.com/biofilter/drumbiofilter/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">inspiration for our system </a>came from Bob Crosby at Biorealis: </p>

<br/>
<p>Finally, Site 3 has been blessed with a metal roof that is perfect for rainwater collection. Installing gutters along the edges, and a pipe that runs into the freshwater tank, should allow Site 3 to completely replenish the water that leaves the system through the black water tank and eliminate the need to use the hose. This will cost another $300.</p>
<p>The entire system should be up and running by early July. Again, we will be posting regular updates here, and at <a href=""http://www.everflux.tech/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.everflux.tech/blog</a>.</p>

<p>What most people don't realize is that the food and sewage waste that we try to get rid of everyday can actually be transformed into valuable resources with the right technologies.</p>
<p>Anaerobic digestion is the key to this transformation. But so far in the modern world, its potential has remained hugely unrealized. This project will demonstrate the potential for onsite anaerobic digestion of organic waste in an urban setting. Renewable biogas can be used for cooking in restaurants, or for water or space heating in buildings. Readily available organic fertilizer in cities could lead to more urban farming. And diverting food waste from landfills, and sewage from our lakes and rivers will leave our land and water much cleaner for future generations.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Building a small plumbing system such as the one proposed for Phase 1 (Flush) is nothing new. The basic concepts for grey water recycling system are also well documented.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The greatest challenge will be constructing the anaerobic digester. While designs for home-sized digesters are abundant, choosing the right one for our situation proved to be a challenge, since most designs are for warm climates like those in India and Africa. Luckily, the basic technology is quite simple: you need an air-tight compartment that is corrosion resistant, can be pressurized, is well insulated and can be easily and efficiently heated. We decided that a modified water heater tank seemed like the perfect fit. But there will be some experimentation involved in getting it right, since no one has ever built a biodigester from a hot water tank, as far as we can tell. So there is a risk that our first attempt at building the biodigester won't work quite right, or will be more expensive to build than we thought.</p>

</div></div>","The Problem
Site 3 Colaboratory is housed in a unique building. Many decades ago it was a horse stable. Before Site 3 came along, it was a blacksmith shop. As a result, it never got connected to the city sewage and water lines. 

And now the city is making it prohibitively expensive to do so. But Site 3 is a busy place, and it needs a bathroom. So currently, the makerspace uses ""fire toilets"" to incinerate people's waste, and sends the ashes and smells up a smoke stack. It's just as unpleasant as it sounds.

Being an environmentally-minded person, I was not enthused by this idea. And Site 3's members are tired of the fire toilets constantly breaking down, or scaring away would-be members.


The Solution
With every problem, there comes an opportunity. I had joined Site 3 in order to build a technology that could convert organic waste into renewable energy & fertilizer, without ever leaving the building where it was produced. 
Soon I realized this was the perfect solution to Site 3's toilet problem. Instead of trying to connect to the city infrastructure, we could combine my technology with grey-water recycling and rainwater collection, to make the bathroom completely self-sustaining and ""zero waste."" Site 3 would become a small island of sustainability in the middle of downtown Toronto.
I hope you will join us in embarking on this pioneering project. You can learn more about the project inception, and keep track of our progress on my blog at www.everflux.tech/blog.

<h3><span>Who are we?</span></h3>
<p>El Fuego del Sol Haiti (FdS) is a small Haitian developmental enterprise that began production of alternative cooking fuel in 2012. At our Port-au-Prince facility, FdS employs twenty workers that were displaced by the 2010 earthquake to produce a clean cooking fuel briquette out of equal parts recycled paper, recycled cardboard, and saw-dust. Agricultural waste from sugarcane, corn, palm, etc. can also be used.</p>
<p>Currently, less than 2% of Haiti's natural forest cover has been cut down to produce charcoal fuel, and charcoal cooking causes chronic pulmonary diseases in the women who cook for hours on end over charcoal stoves daily. Moreover, the typical Haitian family spends roughly 30% of family income on fuel expenses alone. El Fuego del Sol was created to give the Haitian people an alternative cooking fuel that would protect their homes and environment, and to encourage a higher standard of living throughout the country. </p>
<p>FdS has been in operation for nearly one year now, and it has grown dramatically. In the last year FdS has grown from 2 volunteers to 20 workers that are paid a living wage and fed lunch at work every day.  FdS has formed crucial partnerships with important local institutions like MINUSTAH, the World Food Program, the International Organization for Migration, the US Embassy, The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, American NGO Rebuild Globally, and Haitian NGO Haiti Communitere.</p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With our current team of 20 employees, FdS can produce 80,000 fuel briquettes every month. This school year we anticipate a demand of 300,000 briquettes per month for the school feeding program.<strong> </strong>FdS has the capacity to meet this production level if we can hire an additional 15 workers before October. </p>
<p>With new funds, FdS will be able to set up a cookstove assembly workshop in our Port-au-Prince facility and buy the materials necessary to build the stoves so that we do not have to import foreign stoves.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Funding from you will allow FdS to hire 15 more workers to produce briquettes and stoves to meet the demand of the school feeding program!</p>
<p>FdS needs funds since FdS just purchased a new waste collection truck and will hopefully buy a second truck soon so that FdS will be able to service additional waste suppliers. FdS pays the facility cost of $2000 every month for rent. Your donation will help FdS generate additional income by providing paper waste pickup service to more and more suppliers! Your support will help us expand. Long-term, FdS is financially self-sustainable through providing ecological waste collection and recycling services to clients in P-a-P.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to the success of El Fuego del Sol is invaluable to the people of Haiti. FdS is providing multiple services that are severely lacking in the Haitian economy.</p>
<p>FdS is providing a crucial alternative to harmful charcoal cooking. Most Haitian families spend roughly 30% of their income on the charcoal fuel that is destroying the natural forests of Haiti and damaging the health of its cooks. Ten pounds of wood from beautiful trees is destroyed in order to make one pound of charcoal in Haiti, and most charcoal in Haiti now comes illegally from the Dominican Republic. If the DR closes its borders, Haiti will fall into nationwide crisis. Fuel briquettes can save Haiti from crisis.</p>
<p>El Fuego del Sol is committed to long-term financial sustainability. FdS is dedicated to providing quality products that benefit the Haitian people while employing displaced skilled Haitians who now have the ability to feed their families and improve their community.</p>
<p>FdS needs to expand now to meet demand for this year, and you can give it the headstart it needs to be competitive!</p>

FdS is providing a crucial alternative to harmful charcoal cooking. Most Haitian families spend roughly 30% of their income on the charcoal fuel that is destroying the natural forests of Haiti and damaging the health of its cooks. Ten pounds of wood from beautiful trees is destroyed in order to make one pound of charcoal in Haiti, and most charcoal in Haiti now comes illegally from the Dominican Republic. If the DR closes its borders, Haiti will fall into nationwide crisis. Fuel briquettes can save Haiti from crisis.
El Fuego del Sol is committed to long-term financial sustainability. FdS is dedicated to providing quality products that benefit the Haitian people while employing displaced skilled Haitians who now have the ability to feed their families and improve their community.
FdS needs to expand now to meet demand for this year, and you can give it the headstart it needs to be competitive!
 
Don't forget that donations to El Fuego del Sol 
      are tax-deductible in the United States!

Another empty tanker hit this tanker, causing it to capsize.</p><p><b>Impact of the accident:</b></p><p>Waterways throughout the Sundarbans are being contaminated with furnace oil, which is a threat to the bio and eco diversity of the mangrove forest. The oil spill has already blackened the shoreline, spreading over a 60-kilometre-long (37-mile-long) area of the Sundarbans and threatening trees, plankton, and populations of small fish and dolphins. </p><p><b>About The Sundarbans:</b></p><p>The Sundarbans is the world's biggest mangrove forest. Spread over 10,000 square kilometres (3,800 square miles), the Sundarbans is a UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site and home to hundreds of the last remaining Bengal tigers. It is also the largest known home of the rare Irrawaddy Dolphins, which can be found only in South East Asia.  The Sundarbans delta comprises a network of rivers and canals.</p><p>The Bangladeshi government established a sanctuary in the Sundarbans in 2011 after studies found that there were hundreds of endangered Irrawaddy and Ganges River Dolphins living in the area. Fishing is now banned, but tankers and other boats are allowed to pass through.</p><p><b>About The Sela River:</b></p><p>Mongla port, one of the most economically important ports in Bangladesh apart from Chittagong, is situated on the Sela River, which runs through the Sundarbans.</p><p><b>Why was an oil tanker travelling through the Sundarbans?</b></p><p>The alternative route from Mongla to Ghashiakhali has been closed for three years. All commercial vehicles travelling from Mongla Port (the second busiest port in the country) must take this route through the River Shyala.</p><p><b>Why has the Mongla-Ghashiakhali route been closed for 3 years?</b></p><p>The Mongla-Ghashiakhali channel became unsuitable for shipping three years ago due to excessive silt build-up in the Kumarkhali River. The BIWTA began dredging the 22-km channel in July of this year and were set to complete the project in early 2015. Read more <a href=""http://unb.com.bd/mongla-ghashiakhali-channel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p><p><b>Who else is involved in our efforts?</b></p><p>Bangladeshi NGO Amader Gram has been immensely helpful in getting this off the ground. We are extremely grateful for all of their hard work helping us collect local donations.</p><p></p><p><b>Coverage in the media:</b></p><p></p><ul>

OPFLEX is also listed and approved by the Italian EPA and has been approved and deployed by the government of Bermuda. In November 2014, testing at the United States Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement's OHMSETT facility demonstrated that OPFLEX can remove over 80% of spilled oil from water.  A summary video can be accessed here.Downloadable white papers describing the efficacy of the technology as proven in real world disasters are available here.And why do this?The current standard of water monitoring doesn't test for the full gamut of oils, volatiles, semi-volatiles, metals, and metalloids -- but Water Defense can.  Due to the size of this spill and the sensitive nature of the Sundarbans, Water Defense will bring its cumulative water testing to the Sundarbans and share our findings to educate and inform the world.To Bangladeshi Readers: The Sundarbans is our birthright. It is a unique, fragile ecosystem found nowhere else in the world! If we do not care for the Sundarbans today, it might no longer exist for our children and grandchildren.To All Other Global Citizens: There are over 300 species of plants, 150 species of fish, 270 species of birds, 42 species of mammals, 35 reptiles, and 8 amphibian species. Two amphibians, 14 reptiles, 25 aves, and 5 mammals living in the Sundarbans are endangered. The affect of the oil spill on this fragile ecosystem will be wide reaching and long lasting. Help us bring in a team of experts to assist in the clean up of the spill.How we can help clean the Mangroves:

How we plan to test and monitor the waterways for contamination:
This video highlights how we plan to test the water column throughout the affected areas.  It was our announcement from the December 2014 Uplift presentation :

Other remediation tools we plan to donate to the Sundarbans cleanup effort:
How can you participate:There are many ways you can help, whether you are on the ground in the Sundarbans or at home on your computer.1) SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPILL ON SOCIAL MEDIA: The most obvious way is by sharing information about the oil spill on your social media page to keep it top of mind. For the latest information check on Twitter @Sundarbans_SOS for regular updates and remember to use the hashtag #SundarbansOilSpill.2) DONATE TO THIS CAMPAIGN: Every little bit counts! Cost Breakdown (subject to change as situation/necessity changes):1) Cumulative Water Column Testing and helping to remediate impacted areas: $15,0002) Travel for 2 experts from the US: $10,0003) Additional Aid TBD: $15,000Total Ask: $40,000Stretch Goals:4) Grants for local experts, working in conjunction with professors and students (under proper supervision), from Universities in Bangladesh to deploy Water Defense water testing and remediation technology: $12,5005) Additional Water Defense Cumulative Water Column Testing and remediation aid: Depending on our assessment from feedback of people on the ground: $12,500Note: The budget above is our best estimate of the funds we will need, but the reality on the ground is constantly changing. If our team of experts finds that this technology is no longer necessary, funds will be used for future spills and evaluation missions to ensure the health of the Sundarbans ecosystem. How will the funds be used?The money we collect will go directly to Water Defense, a registered NGO in the United States. The money we raise in this international account will be used for non-cash based transactions, as we see fit. However, it may be necessary to transfer some of these funds to a local account for cash-based transactions necessary while traveling in the Sundarbans area. Any extra donations above and beyond will be used to support the affected communities of the Sundarbans.All donations are being tracked transparently. If you have questions at any time about what has been donated, please contact us for a full report.[OTHER BACKGROUND INFORMATION]More About the Spill:At 6am on December 9, 2014, an oil tanker carrying an estimated 357,000 liters (77,000 gallons) of furnace oil was anchored overnight in the Sela River because of dense fog and poor visibility. Another empty tanker hit this tanker, causing it to capsize.Impact of the accident:Waterways throughout the Sundarbans are being contaminated with furnace oil, which is a threat to the bio and eco diversity of the mangrove forest. The oil spill has already blackened the shoreline, spreading over a 60-kilometre-long (37-mile-long) area of the Sundarbans and threatening trees, plankton, and populations of small fish and dolphins. About The Sundarbans:The Sundarbans is the world's biggest mangrove forest. Spread over 10,000 square kilometres (3,800 square miles), the Sundarbans is a UNESCO-listed World Heritage Site and home to hundreds of the last remaining Bengal tigers. It is also the largest known home of the rare Irrawaddy Dolphins, which can be found only in South East Asia.  The Sundarbans delta comprises a network of rivers and canals.The Bangladeshi government established a sanctuary in the Sundarbans in 2011 after studies found that there were hundreds of endangered Irrawaddy and Ganges River Dolphins living in the area. Fishing is now banned, but tankers and other boats are allowed to pass through.About The Sela River:Mongla port, one of the most economically important ports in Bangladesh apart from Chittagong, is situated on the Sela River, which runs through the Sundarbans.Why was an oil tanker travelling through the Sundarbans?The alternative route from Mongla to Ghashiakhali has been closed for three years. All commercial vehicles travelling from Mongla Port (the second busiest port in the country) must take this route through the River Shyala.Why has the Mongla-Ghashiakhali route been closed for 3 years?The Mongla-Ghashiakhali channel became unsuitable for shipping three years ago due to excessive silt build-up in the Kumarkhali River. The BIWTA began dredging the 22-km channel in July of this year and were set to complete the project in early 2015. Read more here.Who else is involved in our efforts?Bangladeshi NGO Amader Gram has been immensely helpful in getting this off the ground. We are extremely grateful for all of their hard work helping us collect local donations.Coverage in the media:
