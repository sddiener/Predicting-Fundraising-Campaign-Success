DreamScreen uses digital signal processing to identify the frequencies and amplitudes in the audio stream. The frequency or pitch of the music controls the color and the amplitude of the music controls the amplitude. This allows for a stunning audio visualization effect when using your television to play music from an HDMI source. DreamScreen works with the stereo audio data on HDMI. The lights on the left side respond to the left channel audio and the right side respond to the right channel audio.</p>

<p>""DreamScreen has reinvented my TV viewing experience! I love how customizable it is through the App and with one tap on the screen I can change the input from video, to audio, to any specific color I want. I even leave it on when I turn the TV off. Fair warning, once you have DreamScreen, watching TV without it is like regressing to black and white, still enjoyable, but you know what you’re missing out on, and it’s just not the same.""</p>
<p>- Rachel Haber, Director, Afligo</p>
<p>""The DreamScreen is an absolute hit for myself and my family, as it adds an element of elegance to my living room that it was previously lacking. I look forward to cozying up at night to enjoy a nice show or a sports game, when the effect is the most vivid. And believe it or not, one of my favorite features is the effect it leaves on my TV when it is off, as the perimeter ambient glow around the tv makes the entire wall look like a fancy movie theater.""</p>

<p><strong>HDMI Resolution </strong></p>
<p>DreamScreen(TM) interfaces with standard 1080p, 1080i, 720p and 720i HDMI resolutions.It supports content at 60Hz, 50Hz. During the HDMI handshake, the television communicates directly with the source and dictates the available HDMI resolution and frame rate. DreamScreen will automatically switch to the correct frequency and resolution within a few seconds. DreamScreen is HDMI 1.4 capable and works with HDCP-encrypted content. </p>
<p><strong>Splitter Technology</strong></p>
<p>An HDMI splitter is used to provide the source signal to both television and DreamScreen. Any off-the-shelf HDMI splitter can be used to provide content to DreamScreen. Don’t worry our standard package includes your very own HDMI splitter. It incorporates an HDCP repeater that ensures that high-resolution HDCP content is available to television and DreamScreen.</p>

<p><strong>Smart LED Strips</strong></p>
<p>Each of the DreamScreen LEDs contains a driver chip that allows for it to be controlled to 16 million colors. A high-speed communication from the stick passes through all the LEDs bringing high resolution and fast response to your television backlighting. The LED Strips have been custom designed for use in this application and are coated with a  polyurethane coating to make them dust and moisture proof while keeping them flexible for installation. </p>

<p><strong>Flexible LED Strips</strong></p>
<p>Three different sizes of DreamScreen are offered and each works for a range of television sizes. The flexible LED strips are easy to route around a television even when it is wall mounted. The wires connecting the strips are at right angles so that they do not stick up causing shadows.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Flexible Mega size can be installed on televisions from 45"" to 65"".</p>
<p>Each model is designed to stretch between a range of television sizes.</p>

<p><strong>Adhesive Strips</strong></p>
<p>The LED strips placed on the back of your television are designed to be repositionable during installation. Easily adjust to properly fit your screen and enjoy a truly responsive home theater experience. The adhesive used is a 3M 300LSE that allows for excellent adhesion of the LED strips to your television. The adhesive features a built in polyester film liner that resists breakage during removal or repositioning. The adhesive strip also features a small tab for easy removal of the protective liner and application.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Adhesive is strong and will not leave residue on television.</p>
<p><strong>60Hz Update Speed</strong></p>
<p> DreamScreen reads the HDMI frame 60 times a second (typical frame rate of an HDMI stream). The content is analyzed, the backlighting content is calculated and the LEDs are updated at 60 times a second. This allows for rapid response when DreamScreen is used to dynamically enhance the content. As the color processing does not use an attached computer, the dedicated product produces the vivid backlighting without any delays. Call of Duty or your favorite Scifi movie will never be the same!</p>

The wireless link allows switching modes, changing brightness and other settings. </p>
<p><strong>Wide Screen Format Detection</strong></p>
<p>Movies are often available in a widescreen letter boxing format. DreamScreen automatically identifies black spaces in the video stream on the top and bottom of the screen and uses color content below black spaces for LED light illumination. The detection is automatic. DreamScreen switches back to normal mode as soon as non-widescreen format is detected on the HDMI stream.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">DreamScreen automatically detects WideScreen Letterboxing</p>
<p><strong>High Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Most HDMI televisions have 1920 x 1080 pixels. That’s a lot of pixels! A backlight with two or a dozen addressable channels will not show the required detail. With DreamScreen, each light source is addressable and even the smallest size (Classic) has 48 addressable points (LEDs). (Mega has 72 LEDs and Xtreme has 96 LEDs) This ensures that more detail on the screen is carried to the backlight. </p>

Testimonials
""DreamScreen is such an amazing product! It was so easy to set up and install and the mobile app is very user-friendly as well. It really does make the TV screen bigger and more fun to watch. We will never watch TV or movies without it again!""              
- Brie McInerney, Director of User Experience, Promet Source
""This is an excellent HDMI LED Backlighting System!""
https://youtu.be/ejmGfn4wdBI
- Ash Tailor, Cinematographer / YouTube Content Creator
""DreamScreen magically enhances your television's visual experience by decreasing higher order aberrations and reducing eye strain at night while simultaneously making your back wall an extension of your viewing experience. Simply watch your favorite movie with DreamScreen on and in the middle of the movie, cut it off... Your family and friends will demand, for their visual pleasure, dreamscreen be turned back on! My parents with cataracts even demand it!""
- Dr. Brent Brown, Atlanta-based Optometrist preforming Digital Eye Strain Study via TV backlighting
""DreamScreen is THE BEST TV enhancement product I've bought! Love the simplicity of the DreamScreen LEDs, they gave my 6yr old TV a new and modern makeover with lights that react to the colors or sounds on the TV.""   
- Gagan Luthra, Product Marketing Mgr., Cypress Semiconductors
""I am a huge fan of this and have been waiting for something like this to come to market for 2-3 years now!""
https://youtu.be/jnezsbm4PRU
- Frank Passalacqua, You Tube Tech Reviewer
""I watch EVERYTHING on DreamScreen now and it has changed my entire home theater setup. I really love having people over to the house when the Music Mode is on, creates a great party scene.""  
- Adam Williams, Design Review, EdgeCast Media
""DreamScreen has reinvented my TV viewing experience! I love how customizable it is through the App and with one tap on the screen I can change the input from video, to audio, to any specific color I want. I even leave it on when I turn the TV off. Fair warning, once you have DreamScreen, watching TV without it is like regressing to black and white, still enjoyable, but you know what you’re missing out on, and it’s just not the same.""
- Rachel Haber, Director, Afligo
""The DreamScreen is an absolute hit for myself and my family, as it adds an element of elegance to my living room that it was previously lacking. I look forward to cozying up at night to enjoy a nice show or a sports game, when the effect is the most vivid. And believe it or not, one of my favorite features is the effect it leaves on my TV when it is off, as the perimeter ambient glow around the tv makes the entire wall look like a fancy movie theater.""
- The Akbasli Family, South Florida
""I have been lucky enough to already test this product and can't imagine using my TV without it now!! Whenever I have guests over it is definitely a conversation piece. :-). Here are some videos of my setup. I have a 50"" 4K TV.""

HDMI Resolution 
DreamScreen(TM) interfaces with standard 1080p, 1080i, 720p and 720i HDMI resolutions.It supports content at 60Hz, 50Hz. During the HDMI handshake, the television communicates directly with the source and dictates the available HDMI resolution and frame rate. DreamScreen will automatically switch to the correct frequency and resolution within a few seconds. DreamScreen is HDMI 1.4 capable and works with HDCP-encrypted content. 
Splitter Technology
An HDMI splitter is used to provide the source signal to both television and DreamScreen. Any off-the-shelf HDMI splitter can be used to provide content to DreamScreen. Don’t worry our standard package includes your very own HDMI splitter. It incorporates an HDCP repeater that ensures that high-resolution HDCP content is available to television and DreamScreen.

Smart LED Strips
Each of the DreamScreen LEDs contains a driver chip that allows for it to be controlled to 16 million colors. A high-speed communication from the stick passes through all the LEDs bringing high resolution and fast response to your television backlighting. The LED Strips have been custom designed for use in this application and are coated with a  polyurethane coating to make them dust and moisture proof while keeping them flexible for installation. 

Flexible LED Strips
Three different sizes of DreamScreen are offered and each works for a range of television sizes. The flexible LED strips are easy to route around a television even when it is wall mounted. The wires connecting the strips are at right angles so that they do not stick up causing shadows.
 
Flexible Mega size can be installed on televisions from 45"" to 65"".
Each model is designed to stretch between a range of television sizes.

Adhesive Strips
The LED strips placed on the back of your television are designed to be repositionable during installation. Easily adjust to properly fit your screen and enjoy a truly responsive home theater experience. The adhesive used is a 3M 300LSE that allows for excellent adhesion of the LED strips to your television. The adhesive features a built in polyester film liner that resists breakage during removal or repositioning. The adhesive strip also features a small tab for easy removal of the protective liner and application.
 

Adhesive is strong and will not leave residue on television.
60Hz Update Speed
 DreamScreen reads the HDMI frame 60 times a second (typical frame rate of an HDMI stream). The content is analyzed, the backlighting content is calculated and the LEDs are updated at 60 times a second. This allows for rapid response when DreamScreen is used to dynamically enhance the content. As the color processing does not use an attached computer, the dedicated product produces the vivid backlighting without any delays. Call of Duty or your favorite Scifi movie will never be the same!
 DreamScreen incorporates a Bluetooth Low Energy device to allow it to be controlled via a smartphone or tablet. The wireless link allows switching modes, changing brightness and other settings. 
Wide Screen Format Detection
Movies are often available in a widescreen letter boxing format. DreamScreen automatically identifies black spaces in the video stream on the top and bottom of the screen and uses color content below black spaces for LED light illumination. The detection is automatic. DreamScreen switches back to normal mode as soon as non-widescreen format is detected on the HDMI stream.

DreamScreen automatically detects WideScreen Letterboxing
High Resolution
Most HDMI televisions have 1920 x 1080 pixels. That’s a lot of pixels! A backlight with two or a dozen addressable channels will not show the required detail. With DreamScreen, each light source is addressable and even the smallest size (Classic) has 48 addressable points (LEDs). (Mega has 72 LEDs and Xtreme has 96 LEDs) This ensures that more detail on the screen is carried to the backlight. 

Mega Size has 72 Individually Addressable LEDs
 Brightness Control
DreamScreen allows users to select between four brightness settings that are based on an array of ambient lighting. The brightness settings can be applied to video, music and ambient mode.
Zone Control
Each DreamScreen ships with enough light strips to line up the complete periphery of your television. However, the DreamScreen App and/or stick allows you to select which zone is activated. You can light up the top, the sides, or the whole TV. 
Low Standby Power
DreamScreen places all backlighting and HDMI components on a low power standby state when HDMI stream is not detected (i.e. when cable box, ChromeCast or gaming console is turned off) or when Standby/Sleep mode is enabled on the App. In other words, in Video or Music Mode, turning off your HDMI source will turn off all the lights behind your television.

<p>Vox Vapes is a small design house dedicated to creating amazing vape gear, and we love what we do. It's who we are. As a collective of family and friends we've continued to grow and mature, to evolve into what we are today. Most days, Vox Vapes is a labor of love.</p>
<p>Vox Vapes started as an internet retailer nearly three years ago with a very limited inventory, a small home office, and an eBay store. Honestly, we didn't expect much to come out of it, but were pleasantly surprised when our shiny, new (understaffed and underfunded) startup took off. Since our inception, we've transitioned from retailer, to wholesaler, and now into a fully functioning design house.</p>
<p>Our goal is to design and fabricate new vape products that are conceptually interesting, innovative, and easy to use. Selfishly, we design devices that we'd be ecstatic to use ourselves. It's a pretty sweet perk, but as fellow vapers, we hope you love our creations too.</p>

</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When we set out to create a new RDA, our goal was a no-compromise design that produced exceptional flavor, colossal clouds, and appealed to a wide range of vapers and coil builders. After nearly two years in design and development and almost a dozen RDA samples, we are proud to introduce the Mora RDA, one of the best atomizers ever created.</p>
<p>The Mora RDA appears simple to the eye, but is packed full of nerdy engineering goodness. We started with the best materials available, medical-grade 316 stainless steel and PEEK insulators. The airflow is placed low on the RDA barrel in relation to where the coils sit, creating a stream of air that flows above, below, and around the coil, ensuring uniform cooling even on the hottest builds, maximum vapor production, and intense flavor. Each airflow slot on the Mora RDA opens sequentially, allowing an almost infinite number of possibilities.</p>
<p>Due to its unique design and airflow placement the Mora RDA produces incredible flavor on par with the best bottom-airflow atomizers on the market today, but is less prone to leaking and more adjustable to each individual's preferred vaping style.</p>
<p>If cloud chasing is your thing, the Mora is right for you. If flavor chasing is your thing, the Mora is right for you. If you're all about single coils and/or temperature control, then the Mora is right for you.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Features</h4>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Constructed from medical-grade 316 stainless steel</li>
<li>Triple-tier infinity airflow design with single coil option</li>
<li>16mm wide-bore drip tip (insert included to use standard-size tips)</li>
<li>Large build deck, but small overall chamber size</li>
<li>6mm deep juice well</li>

<p>With our sole focus on design and development of new vape products, Vox Vapes has excitedly jumped on the opportunity to partner up with Pink Cloud Vape Shop to distribute and sell our creations.
</p>
<p>As fellow vapers, we turn to Pink Cloud first when needing new gear, juice, or accessories. Pink Cloud has a killer selection, great prices, and a sweet web store. Their staff and customer service is the best in the business and their support and commitment to the vaping community is unparalleled.</p>
<p>Pink Cloud will be the first store carrying the Mora RDA (both retail and wholesale) as well as future creations by Vox Vapes.</p>

<h3>Our Campaign</h3>
<p>The best part about our campaign is the Mora RDA is already in production! What this means is we have already locked down manufacturing and a supply chain, and will be able to fulfill any and all perks in a timely manner. But that doesn't mean we don't need any help.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise at least $10,000 with this campaign. Your contributions will bolster our ability to run smoothly and efficiently during the Mora RDA roll-out, get a head start on future production runs, and lessen the financial burden brought on by research, design, and development of new products.</p>
<p>At Vox Vapes, we prefer to do things the right way the first time around. We don't cut corners and we don't expect anything for free. That's why we've come up with some seriously great perks for you to take advantage of.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>The Perks</h4>
<p>Our goal when designing perks for this campaign was to make them irresistible. At every level, you have the opportunity to pick up some crazy cool stuff (including the Mora RDA) at an unbeatable price. We want you to feel great about your contribution and about us here at Vox Vapes.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Vox Vapes started out much smaller than it is today, but still has a lot of growing to do. As a small company of family and friends, we have poured our blood, sweat, tears, and most of our life savings into getting this far. We need your help to continue to move forward.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself and the rest of the staff on a personal level, Vox Vapes represents more than just a business. We depend on its success to put food on the table, pay off student loans, and take care of our families (humans and furry critters alike). We are proud to serve the vaping community. As all involved are avid vapers, this company is truly a labor of love. The companies in the vape community aren't just out to make a buck, they support each other. We're a part of this support. We want the best products for you, because we use them too.<br/></p> <ul> <li>Our employees really are the best of the best in their respective fields with tons of experience. We employ successful entrepreneurs, engineers, graphic designers, and artists. Even our accountant is a rockstar. Our staff has the experience, skills, tools, and vision to make Vox Vapes a rousing success. What we don't have is an extra $10,000. That's where you come in!</li>
<br/><li>Help us help you. You want top of the line vape products at very reasonable prices? So do we. Help us fund this project and we'll continue to provide you with innovative, high-quality products and devices to bring you the tastiest, most mouthwatering clouds possible for many years to come.<br/>

When we set out to create a new RDA, our goal was a no-compromise design that produced exceptional flavor, colossal clouds, and appealed to a wide range of vapers and coil builders. After nearly two years in design and development and almost a dozen RDA samples, we are proud to introduce the Mora RDA, one of the best atomizers ever created.
The Mora RDA appears simple to the eye, but is packed full of nerdy engineering goodness. We started with the best materials available, medical-grade 316 stainless steel and PEEK insulators. The airflow is placed low on the RDA barrel in relation to where the coils sit, creating a stream of air that flows above, below, and around the coil, ensuring uniform cooling even on the hottest builds, maximum vapor production, and intense flavor. Each airflow slot on the Mora RDA opens sequentially, allowing an almost infinite number of possibilities.
Due to its unique design and airflow placement the Mora RDA produces incredible flavor on par with the best bottom-airflow atomizers on the market today, but is less prone to leaking and more adjustable to each individual's preferred vaping style.
If cloud chasing is your thing, the Mora is right for you. If flavor chasing is your thing, the Mora is right for you. If you're all about single coils and/or temperature control, then the Mora is right for you.


Features


Constructed from medical-grade 316 stainless steel
Triple-tier infinity airflow design with single coil option
16mm wide-bore drip tip (insert included to use standard-size tips)
Large build deck, but small overall chamber size
6mm deep juice well
PEEK insulators
Copper positive center pin





Our Partner, Pink Cloud Vape Shop             


With our sole focus on design and development of new vape products, Vox Vapes has excitedly jumped on the opportunity to partner up with Pink Cloud Vape Shop to distribute and sell our creations.

As fellow vapers, we turn to Pink Cloud first when needing new gear, juice, or accessories. Pink Cloud has a killer selection, great prices, and a sweet web store. Their staff and customer service is the best in the business and their support and commitment to the vaping community is unparalleled.
Pink Cloud will be the first store carrying the Mora RDA (both retail and wholesale) as well as future creations by Vox Vapes.





Our Campaign
The best part about our campaign is the Mora RDA is already in production! What this means is we have already locked down manufacturing and a supply chain, and will be able to fulfill any and all perks in a timely manner. But that doesn't mean we don't need any help.
Our goal is to raise at least $10,000 with this campaign. Your contributions will bolster our ability to run smoothly and efficiently during the Mora RDA roll-out, get a head start on future production runs, and lessen the financial burden brought on by research, design, and development of new products.
At Vox Vapes, we prefer to do things the right way the first time around. We don't cut corners and we don't expect anything for free. That's why we've come up with some seriously great perks for you to take advantage of.

The Perks
Our goal when designing perks for this campaign was to make them irresistible. At every level, you have the opportunity to pick up some crazy cool stuff (including the Mora RDA) at an unbeatable price. We want you to feel great about your contribution and about us here at Vox Vapes.

    
   

Risks & Challenges  Vox Vapes started out much smaller than it is today, but still has a lot of growing to do. As a small company of family and friends, we have poured our blood, sweat, tears, and most of our life savings into getting this far. We need your help to continue to move forward.
Speaking for myself and the rest of the staff on a personal level, Vox Vapes represents more than just a business. We depend on its success to put food on the table, pay off student loans, and take care of our families (humans and furry critters alike). We are proud to serve the vaping community. As all involved are avid vapers, this company is truly a labor of love. The companies in the vape community aren't just out to make a buck, they support each other. We're a part of this support. We want the best products for you, because we use them too.  Our employees really are the best of the best in their respective fields with tons of experience. We employ successful entrepreneurs, engineers, graphic designers, and artists. Even our accountant is a rockstar. Our staff has the experience, skills, tools, and vision to make Vox Vapes a rousing success. What we don't have is an extra $10,000. That's where you come in!
Help us help you. You want top of the line vape products at very reasonable prices? So do we. Help us fund this project and we'll continue to provide you with innovative, high-quality products and devices to bring you the tastiest, most mouthwatering clouds possible for many years to come.
    


Get Social With Us!
 Even if you can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help us grow and reach our goals (and score some sweet swag in the process). Connect with us on social media! During the campaign we will be running regular giveaways for free devices and gear on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter so give us a follow to stay in the know. Extra cool points will be given for any sharing on blogs or websites.

device which holds all kinds of valuable sensitive data. You would be at the
mercy of anyone who stumbles through it. Thanks toThumby, there’s no need to
worry anymore. Your data remains to be secure even if your drive falls into the
wrong hands.



Easy to
Set Up and UseThumby is designed to replace your standard
unsecure external hard drive enclosure. It’s not just compact and stylish it’s
also extremely easy to set up and use, in just a few steps.

Each Thumby pack comes with a USB 3.0 cable, an

device with the Thumby Drive. That’s all there is to it! Now you’re ready to
safely store your valuable data.

Automatic
Locking/Unlocking Feature
Thumby drive
uses Bluetooth connection for lock and unlock operations.When you inside the Bluetooth connection range with your securely paired smart
device ,  Thumby automatically unlocks
your drive and you can access your sensitive data directly. When you go to the
out of this range , Thumby locks your drive automatically and stored data
inside of your drive can not accessible after that. This lock/unlock process
done in the background , You don’t need to do anything to manage this process.



Manual
Locking/Unlocking Feature


Sometimes
may you want to lock or unlock your data manually.Thumby only unlock your
encrypted data if your securely paired smart device inside of the Bluetooth
connection range , if you turn off Bluetooth connection of your smart device ,
Thumby automatically locks your data. This mean you can stay it lock position
even when you inside of the unlock range.
You can
simply control your Thumby drive with your smart device by turning on or off
your smart device’s Bluetooth feature.



Elegant
Design


After designing a fair amount of different prototypes, we
finally made Thumby that is beautifully and minimally designed. It is
stylish and lightweight.

<br/><b>Flat Attack</b> weighs   .035 Kgs or 35 grams including the battery -   length is 100 mm Width is 20 mm.<br/><br/>The driver delivers a 500mAh 5v output required for 
most mobile devices on the market to date. Power source = 1 x AA battery 1.5V <b>(3100mAh)</b>. <br/><br/><p><b>Real Techy  Stuff:</b></p>
<p><b>Flat Attack
Technical Specifications</b> - by Jake King - Security <b>Engineer Hootsuite</b> <b>Canada</b> and Design and Electrical Consultant, R&amp;D. Debtone Enterprises (some information has been omitted to protect IP)</p>
<p>The Flat Attack charging device, is a slim form factor multi platform
 emergency charging device, that utilises SMD components and multi-layer
 PCB construction to minimise footprint and increase efficiency. The 
initial design and implementation of Flat Attack has changed over a 
number of revisions and has been refined into a device capable of use in
 a variety of environments with regular use.</p>
<p>Flat Attack uses the 
common AA size battery, to allow for maximum compatibility with cutting 
edge lithium cells (used in cameras, phones, mobile gaming devices, etc)
 while retaining compatibility with existing Alkaline or 
Layer-Construction batteries with great efficiency. Depending on phone 
model and specifications of the internal battery of the mobile device, 
gains of up to 57% have been recorded in test environments with Lithium 
Cells, and up to 25% in Alkaline. (Data available by request).</p>

<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>
<figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The circuit is simple in nature removing 
many of the pitfalls of devices in similar categories - By reducing the 
component count to a minimum bare bones solution, points of failure are 
decreased and efficiency is maintained. Simple indicator LED’s have been
 chosen to maximise the current able to be delivered to the battery and 
reduce the complexity of interfaces associated with typical products of 
this nature.</p>
<p>The driver delivers a 500mAh 5v output required for 
most mobile devices on the market to date. This not only meets 
requirements for EMI and CE certification, but also provides a low noise
 output with sensitive electronics in mind.</p>
<p>Power source = 1 x AA battery 1.5V ( 3100mAh).</p>

Flat Attack is a revolution in disposable AA battery, mobile phone charging. It is the most powerful,  technologically advanced, single AA battery operated, mobile phone charger (Portable Power Stick) in the World, using state of art circuitry.Other Rechargable types will go dead, just like your mobile phone if NOT constanly charged over and over again. Flat Attack's battery will last up to 10 years if not used !!!!!!!Also : There are many cheap AA battery operated chargers in the market now. They do not work at that best you will be lucky to get 10% charge. Also they do not charge all smart phones especially Apple phones. Flat Attack charges ALL smart phones Flat Attack has a very advanced circuit board that has been developed over 4 years. Flat Attack will give you  7 or more hours of extra standby time on all smart phones (android and Apple) 4 hours of constant texting and over an hour of constant talking.  Not bad for a AA battery ?Flat Attack is ready to use from the box, unlike rechargeable power sticks on the market now, that require a top up charge for 6-8 hours or more.Works instantly and has NO LEADS TO CARRY AROUND.Do not waste your money on rechargeable power sticks, they run out of juice within 2-6 weeks, if not constantly charged, like your mobile phone. Flat Attack will not go dead like rechargeable power sticks. AA batteries last for years when not in use. AA batteries are available  24 hours a day and work instantly to charge your phone.

Flat Attack weighs   .035 Kgs or 35 grams including the battery -   length is 100 mm Width is 20 mm.The driver delivers a 500mAh 5v output required for

Flat Attack
Technical Specifications - by Jake King - Security Engineer Hootsuite Canada and Design and Electrical Consultant, R&D. Debtone Enterprises (some information has been omitted to protect IP)
The Flat Attack charging device, is a slim form factor multi platform
 emergency charging device, that utilises SMD components and multi-layer
 PCB construction to minimise footprint and increase efficiency. The 
initial design and implementation of Flat Attack has changed over a 
number of revisions and has been refined into a device capable of use in
 a variety of environments with regular use.
Flat Attack uses the 
common AA size battery, to allow for maximum compatibility with cutting 
edge lithium cells (used in cameras, phones, mobile gaming devices, etc)
 while retaining compatibility with existing Alkaline or 
Layer-Construction batteries with great efficiency. Depending on phone 
model and specifications of the internal battery of the mobile device, 
gains of up to 57% have been recorded in test environments with Lithium 
Cells, and up to 25% in Alkaline. (Data available by request).



The circuit is simple in nature removing 
many of the pitfalls of devices in similar categories - By reducing the 
component count to a minimum bare bones solution, points of failure are 
decreased and efficiency is maintained. Simple indicator LED’s have been
 chosen to maximise the current able to be delivered to the battery and 
reduce the complexity of interfaces associated with typical products of 
this nature.
The driver delivers a 500mAh 5v output required for 
most mobile devices on the market to date. This not only meets 
requirements for EMI and CE certification, but also provides a low noise
 output with sensitive electronics in mind.
Power source = 1 x AA battery 1.5V ( 3100mAh).



 














Why We Went Green 

“There will be 2.3 billion 
smartphone users in 2015 which will contribute to the 4.75 billion 
people worldwide using a mobile phone” Source: Emarketer.com 
Flat Attack has been designed to comply with the new (green) environmental standards
 that have been implemented for charging devices to the European 
Standard, which have been the standard in Europe since 2010. (Micro USB 
Port).
This standard has been implemented to save the hydrocarbon 
waste which is produced by having multiple chargers or leads and 
adapters for different phones. Hence the reduction of excessive 
hydrocarbon wastes eg: plastics being discarded.
Flat Attack (Trade Marked) has been designed to comply with the new environmental standards and has a Micro USB port. This Micro USB port is 50% more energy efficient and will now be the preferred charger pin for all devices. This means no leads that end up in rubbish fills and damage the environment.

""Always Stay Connected” 





Flat Attack is the idea of former Full time Fire-fighter, Anthony Peacock, who saw the need for an emergency phone charger
that was compact, small and did not require power cables.
Fighting fires as well as a long stint in the Regular Army Airborne, 
often meant Anthony went long periods of time away from a power source, 
which rendered his mobile phone useless in the field. 
The resulting idea was to create a keyring sized universal device 
charger which was powered by one AA battery and didn't need an initial 
charge.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The initial app project will focus on the Ala Archa National Park in the Tian Shan Mountains south of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.  Ala Archa NP covers approximately 200 square kilometres of alpine terrain and ranges in elevation from 1,500 metres to nearly 5,000 metres at its highest peak.  Due to the varied elevation and rugged topography, there are many different bio-zones throughout the park, allowing for a great diversity of habitats and rich biodiversity to be present within its boundaries. Current estimates for butterflies, for example, indicate approximately 100 species within the relatively small area of Ala Archa National Park. </p>

</div></div>","Kyrgyzstan has long been considered the “Switzerland of Central Asia.”  The vast alpine regions of the country contain an incredible array of biodiversity with many endangered and endemic species of flora and fauna, both within national parks and across the extensive landscapes.  However, the resources available to help inform and educate the public about the importance of biodiversity and of conservation in Kyrgyzstan are extremely limited. With support from Plateau Perspectives, the aim of this project is to build a smartphone app that will provide people with a means to learn about the country's wildlife and interact with its network of national parks and other protected areas.  Local people and regional/international travellers alike will thus find new opportunities to learn about the importance of biodiversity through enjoyment of nature - simultaneously raising environmental awareness and promoting the conservation of biodiversity in Kyrgyzstan.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">NiftyKey was designed in collaboration with professional hackers and provides protection against common tools used to bypass Windows Login.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>NiftyKey is <i>convenient</i></b>. It is easier than using a password, yet you still have the ability to secure your PC. By the way, you can set an optional Master Password to ensure access even when you lost your physical key. You can also assign multiple PCs to one key / multiple keys to one PC.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>NiftyKey is <i>cheap</i></b>. Only $15 for your personal key including international shipping. Updates and Upgrades (additional features) are free and will always be.</p>

It is more secure than Windows Login, similar software and is password-free. The principle is simple: Unplug the USB key if you go away and plug it back in to continue work. Just like your front door!
NiftyKey was designed in collaboration with professional hackers and provides protection against common tools used to bypass Windows Login. It is completely autonomous and does not interact with the standard Windows tools, so it will still run, even when the Windows authentication was cracked (using KonBoot, for example).


NiftyKey is convenient. It is easier than using a password, yet you still have the ability to secure your PC. By the way, you can set an optional Master Password to ensure access even when you lost your physical key. You can also assign multiple PCs to one key / multiple keys to one PC.
NiftyKey is cheap. Only $15 for your personal key including international shipping. Updates and Upgrades (additional features) are free and will always be.
NiftyKey is safe. This does not only include the security aspect. NK is completely Made In Germany under safe working conditions. All used materials are free from harmful substances.


How do I get my NiftyKey?
Choose the $15 perk ""NiftyKey"". Your NK will be shipped by the end of this campaign.
Do i have to pay shipping?
No. International shipping is included :)
Can I use my NiftyKey at my Mac?
No, not at this moment. There are plans to further develop the software to be usable with other OS when the campaign was successful.
What if someone pulls out my key while I'm working on the PC?
Nothing will be lost. The NiftyKey does not use the Windows Logout. You can continue your work when your key is back in.
What if I lose my key?
Don't worry. You can set a backup password for when you lose your key.
I broke my key?
We provide a warranty of 1 year. If your key was damaged (not purposefully), we will replace it.
The campaign ended, how do I get one?
If the campaign ended successfully, you'll be still able to buy one on this very site. We take advantage of Indiegogos awesome InDemand program, which enables post-campaign sales.
I don't need one, but I'd still like to contribute. What can I do?

</h1>Most of us can remember a time when we turn off our iron after we were doing ironing our clothes or worried if we did after we left the house.  An iron left on for long periods of time definitely wastes a lot of energy and could possibly cause a life-risking fire.<br/><br/>We've solved that problem with  auto shut off thanks to our patented technology that detects  when the iron is idle for a while leading to it safely shutting it self down.  <br/><br/><br/>
<h1>
<b>How Our Smart Iron Works.</b><br/>
</h1>
<p>We have an accelerometer chip installed in the 
Iron. It detects the idle state of the iron  by detecting the 
absence of ironing motion and switches off the Iron  after a set time.
 Since it completely shuts off Iron , it is safe and avoid the use of
 power.</p>

<br/><b>Temperature</b> <b>Control</b><br/>Precise temperature control with the use of a semiconductor temperature sensor and micro-controller. The iron's temperature can be set from your mobile phone . When the temperature reaches the set level and ready to use it give you an audio alert on your smart phone.  No waiting by the iron while it's warming up; you can be about your business around your home taking care of other things until your iron tells you it's ready.</div><div>
<br/><b>Auto switch off idle time for Horizontal and Vertical positions</b><br/>Conventional irons are designed sit in a vertical position when not in use even for a short while. The Smart Iron  detects the position of the iron and allows the user to set an idle time at different positions. It's customary to allow for a longer idle time when our smart iron is in the vertical position so the iron doesn't get cold if you need to take a phone call or check on your dinner cooking on the stove. There are factory-set idle times for both positions  of 5 minutes but can be changed to any time up to a maximum of 15 minutes.</div><div>

</div>
<div style=""background: #eee; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 5px 10px;""><span>The benefits for other Countries will be that, they will gain knowledge on other instruments that were unknown to them. These instruments will inspire them to write new kind of music and who knows, they might even create new styles too. Georgian Native Instruments can be combined with other well-known instruments to create a completely new tune and a new polyphonic music; There are many compositions written in XVII-XX century using Georgian native orchestra.</span></div>

GEORGIAN NATIVE VIRTUAL INSTRUMENTS
History & culture of Georgia mesmerize everyone who will discover it. Beyond the beautiful sights and nature lays hidden rich and colorful culture of Georgia. The most unique and playful is Georgian Folklore. Songs, dances, rhymes, games combined altogether represents the ancient Georgian soul.
The main subject of below article will be Georgian native instruments. From historical sources are known over 100 Georgian musical instruments. Most part of which is now long-lost or forgotten, buried in the sands of time. Each region has their specific musical instruments, they might resemble each other, but the sound is different for each of them.

 ​​What is Virtual Instrument?Virtual instrument (VSTi) is a 3rd party plug-in for Digital Audio Workstations (DAW) nowadays used in every recording, mastering and mixing studios. Different from the synthesizers, - sample players (ROM players) give the user opportunity to use, high quality prerecorded, tuned, filtered & corrected sounds (notes, chords, etc.) Under creating the virtual instrument lies the huge work of professional instrument players, acoustic engineers, sound engineers, recording engineers, software developers and scientist. It is impossible for you to record better sound with better gear & team.The VSTi user interface gives the user all recorded libraries, notes to the piano keyboard, compatible to be played from midi, touch-pad, DAW or other.

RECONSTRUCTION OF THE INSTRUMENTS




We will research and reconstruct some ancient Georgian Instruments which were lost in past centuries.

Each new reconstructed instrument will be added as a new pattern to software. 



Each update of software will be available for free for our customers who purchased this software through Indiegogo campaign.




In 1930 a Swan bone Salamuri (flute) was found together with other relics in ancient burials of ""Samtavro"" in Mtskheta. Supposedly it dates back to the 15th-13th centuries B.C. It appeared, that it is possible to issue 10 sounds from it not by the over-blowing, but by inclining the instrument under different angles, and in this way we get seven different tetra chords that, as the final result, it represents sound system.



For 1st time a couple of plates (i.e. “Tsintsila”) were found during archaeolo- gical excavations in a Sepulchre, dated back to the 4th century A.D. The comparison of the old and new plates showed that the Tsintsila has a better design and sound reproducing than the simple plates used in the modern (military) orchestras which do not have girdles of sound distributing and holes of sound balancing.

FAQ

 1.  What is the difference between a real instrument and a virtual instrument?
VSTi is used to easily write & edit notes, chords, melodies of multiple instruments in real time; It doesn't need long time playing and recording process to get the sound you want.Virtual applications, are worldwide standard in recording studios, which enables customers to purchase a higher quality product for a much lower price than it would cost them to record on their own at the studio; it Will also save time for them. 

   2.  Is this software hard to use?


GNI VSTi has very user friendly interface, people who are familiar to any DAW software, will easily get used to it; Beginners can follow user manual for software installation, setting and any further information.
   3.  What are the benefits for other Countries and people?

The benefits for other Countries will be that, they will gain knowledge on other instruments that were unknown to them. These instruments will inspire them to write new kind of music and who knows, they might even create new styles too. Georgian Native Instruments can be combined with other well-known instruments to create a completely new tune and a new polyphonic music; There are many compositions written in XVII-XX century using Georgian native orchestra.
   5.  Where can I find Caucasian/Georgian musical Instruments library?

There is no professional, high quality complete audio Library of our regions out now. Our product will be available on our official site and Indiegogo campaign. 
   6.  Budget of 250 000 $ is enough to fulfill this project?
Just said, this is not enough to fulfill such project. We ask for the minimum, which includes purchasing necessary hardware , customs clearance, other material costs and not the studio team member's salaries. Our team has  great enthusiasm for this project and it will be only doubled by hardworking: only documentary might cost 200 000 $ if not mention the audio recording, gift packages and the necessary resources for project. Our interest in the first place is to introduce ourselves to Georgian and foreign people and represent our culture in deserved manner.
   7.  Why no one has done it before?
Many nation's ethnic instruments are revived in studio programs and libraries. Such programs' demand raised since 2000,  when powerful, high quality digital hardware changed their ancestors.  Our studio has the knowledge and passion to create this product... (see question 6 and you will guess)
   8.  What makes our partnership interesting?
Such  project is not implemented in Georgia so far. It will be historic, glorious, meaningful presentation of our culture, the creators and promoters of this project, will leave their trace in our inheritance.
   9.  What are the opportunities of this project?
Georgia documentary and future films, commercials and others  mostly accompanied by  Asian music because there are no  opportunities and  resources to write a new Georgian-style melodies and  decor video  with traditional  Georgian music. The project will allow the composers to write the music without leaving homes. We will implement a number of projects in entertainment industry, where  we will use the Georgian culture, and we need a library to describe/record it.",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>The philosophy of Swipe it Fwd is simple. We believe the best way to donate effectively and efficiently is by finding charity groups that are affiliated with projects and campaigns that are of interest to us. Instead of having donation limits with charity groups, being stopped in the street, or receiving campaigns from groups that we've never heard about or of interest to us, we wanted a platform that proactively finds all the groups out there that matches our categories and allow us to split our donations among them. Swipe it Fwd encourages users to rate, like, and promote charity groups leaving a mark in the world. We want to build a socially aware community through Swipe it Forward, where we empower charities, in real time, to make informed and confident choices based on our donations and help.</p>

<p>We are a team of designers in Hong Kong, having experience on designing and producing various products for over 10 years. Over the past year we have created a brand new concept for your charging experience with existing technology.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h4>Do I need a sticker so my iPhone can charge wirelessly?<br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Yes but you also need a QI compatible charger, either from Samsung or IKEA. If you do not have these kinds of wireless chargers, we suggest you to purchase our MOOS charger set. </span>
</h4>
<h4>How do I choose the graphic design of the sticker? </h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;line-height: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We will send you a survey after our campaign has ended. </span></h4>
<h4><span style=""line-height: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">How is MOOS packaged? </span></h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;line-height: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">MOOS comes in a simple and economic plastic bag. We don't want to raise the price for you to add some complicated packaging which cannot be recyclable. A premium packaging option may be available later on in the campaign. </span></h4>
<h4><span style=""line-height: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">How fast will it charge? </span></h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;line-height: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This depends on your power supply. As we use Qi technology, it has around 70% of the energy as an ordinary charging cable. </span></h4>
<h4><span style=""line-height: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Is it safe to use MOOS? </span></h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;line-height: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Yes it is absolutely safe to use MOOS. Our sticker does not contain any battery or harmful materials. </span></h4>

OUR TEAM




We are a team of designers in Hong Kong, having experience on designing and producing various products for over 10 years. Over the past year we have created a brand new concept for your charging experience with existing technology. All the MOOS products on this page are functional prototypes. Changes may also occur in the final solution of MOOS based on the feedback we receive during this campaign.

FAQ
Do I need a sticker so my iPhone can charge wirelessly?Yes but you also need a QI compatible charger, either from Samsung or IKEA. If you do not have these kinds of wireless chargers, we suggest you to purchase our MOOS charger set. 

How do I choose the graphic design of the sticker? 
We will send you a survey after our campaign has ended. 
How is MOOS packaged? 
MOOS comes in a simple and economic plastic bag. We don't want to raise the price for you to add some complicated packaging which cannot be recyclable. A premium packaging option may be available later on in the campaign. 
How fast will it charge? 
This depends on your power supply. As we use Qi technology, it has around 70% of the energy as an ordinary charging cable. 
Is it safe to use MOOS? 
Yes it is absolutely safe to use MOOS. Our sticker does not contain any battery or harmful materials. 
Can I get a refund? 
Sure, but please let us know before the end of campaign!",19.0,2,"1 Campaign

The first 100 people to sponsor a child will get this personalized award poster for free.





What We Need



Tuition for children who cannot afford course fees. 

$3000 for computers for each additional 100 kids
per week.

A larger location with multiple
classrooms.

Training for more instructors and teaching
assistants.

Did we mention tuition for children? 100% of donations go towards the kids tuition!






What You Get




This is a chance to give something that is truly valuable because it can change a child's life. You will get sincere appreciation from the child or children you are helping. It's an amazing feeling to receive a heartfelt thank you from a child who has been inspired to learn, imagine and create.
For each person who sponsors a child, you will receive 


A personalized video of the child thanking you for helping make their dreams a reality.


A video of the child's presentation to their class of their project.


A personalized Tech Kids Project award poster.





Every dollar helps - Please donate whatever you can



If the child were right in front of you, most people would take the time to help. It's the children that get lost between the cracks and don't have anyone to provide the means for them to take classes in technology that we are helping.

Most people don't think twice about spending a few dollars every day on coffee, watching movies or TV, connecting to the internet, talking on their phone, or any of the other numerous things we spend $2-5 on every day. The amount you spend in one day on any one of these things can help a child's future dreams come true.






Learning about technology will help children in every career. Kids being left out of opportunities is one of the hardest things for them to comprehend. This can quickly lead to loss of optimism, decreased self esteem and hopelessness.

The best help you can give is to sponsor a child for $79. If this is prohibitive, you can still be a part of changing lives! Every dollar helps, and every person who donates counts since this helps our campaign trend higher and get in front of more people. 





Background Information


How The Idea Was Formed

 
The idea of The Tech Kids Project was born from the simple fact that I could not find a quality after school computer programming course for my 8 year old son. You may be thinking ""So what? Couldn't I just find something else for him to participate in?"" I think once you understand a bit more of my reasoning behind this, you will agree with the importance of this for all kids, and for the future of our country, 



First, are children making good use of their time outside of school? The amount of time most children spend playing video games, tells me that they are not. I found that I spent a lot of my time just monitoring my son's video game playing time. I had already put him in other after school programs such as Art, Chess and Taekwondo. While these programs are all great, he still goes straight to play video games as soon as he gets home.  In addition, several classes were cancelled because families could not afford the tuition.  If children are going to spend a lot of time on video games, why not make it something that will help them in life, and teach them to code their own games.


Second, skills in technology and computer science will help all children regardless of their career choice. My reason for wanting him to learn about computers and specifically programming is because of my own life experiences. In my teens, I taught myself computer programming.  I began at Intel Corp. as an application developer, and worked my way up to managing an IT Business Solutions department at Intel Corp, being responsible for world wide applications.  I left Intel to start my own successful company providing Websites, Applications and Search Engine Optimization to small businesses. My own in depth knowledge of how computers truly work through understanding computer programming has helped me immensely in every position I have held. While I expected younger generations to enter the job force with in-depth knowledge of technology that would surpass my own skills, it's become apparent that this is not the case.  Although kids are experts at spending hours playing video games and navigating social media,  the kids of the Tech generation are not learning valuable computer skills.



There
is no doubt that in the future, technology will be far more integrated into our
lives than it is even today. Computers and Technology will play a pivotal role in the future in almost every profession. Regardless of the career choice of any child, an in depth knowledge of how computers work will help them immensely. The value of inspiring children to believe in themselves, dream big, and build confidence that they can make those dreams come true is priceless.


Numerous studies show that participation in quality, experiential after school programs result in:




Increased academic achievement
Improved school attendance
Higher levels of student engagement and motivation to learn
Increased likelihood of high school graduation
Higher self-esteem
Enhanced social skills
Reduced delinquency.


The Tech Kids Project, Inc. Was Put Into Action



With the goal in mind to truly educate our future leaders in Technology, and give them the skills to not only be successful in their lives, but to inspire them to dream big, and give them the tools and confidence to make their dreams a reality, I approached colleagues in the Tech industry and in the Education field.
The Tech Kids Project Inc. was incorporated as an Arizona Non-Profit Corporation in September 2015.

<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<p>The main costs in this project are the PCBs and the on-board controller. Both of these are cheaper when bought in bulk. We can meet the $6 a board with an order size of $600 or

In 2002 some friends and I set up <a href=""http://www.austhai.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AusThai Solutions</a> to design and develop electronic solutions for all sorts of applications from industry to education and hobby electronics.

This is the sort of project we are designing all the time.</p>
<p><b><i>How long will it take?</i></b></p>
<p>We have the PCB design ready to go. As soon as the campaign is over we
will order the PCBs. These will take two weeks to arrive. We have a supplier
who has the controller in stock so we will have them before the
PCBs arrive. Then we assemble and ship. The whole process wont take longer than 4 weeks.</p>
<p><b><i>What will we do if we don’t hit the $600 target?</i></b></p>
<p>With a deep sigh we will reach into our pockets and make up any difference needed to make it happen.</p>

<h3>Founders Story</h3>
<p>Products that rise to meteoric success are usually based on solving a simple consumer desire. The next part is designing it to be so simple that once people try it, they don’t know how they lived without it before. I had the idea years ago and kept searching for ways to bring it to life. Now that it’s come to fruition I invite everyone to enjoy my vision. It started when I was at a party in college. The music was great, but there was NO lighting to amp up the energy. My initial thought was, “why can’t someone make a normal sized light bulb that threads into a light socket that has a strobe effect?” All we had were those big, ugly and heavy strobe boxes. I did some research and discovered there was nothing out there. It kept nagging at me, so right after college, I bought the domain PartyBulb.com and started working on my idea. I had plenty of vision. However, money was an issue. Fortunately, the necessary technology caught up with my idea then the component pricing came down. At that point, Team Party Bulb was able to take it to the next level. The Party Bulb is now patented with a functioning APP, Bluetooth connectivity and the ability to match the beat of any song. Oh...did I mention it also has a speaker! We are proud to pre-launch on Kickstarter and can’t wait until everyone can share our dream being the first to have “The Bulb that Parties”. </p>

Through the business trip, he always felt that typing on iPad at the mobile situation is not easy and needs more efficient device for typing. He actually investigated compact and functional keyboard through the Internet. However, he could not find anything satisfactory. He bought a lot of keyboards but could not find best one.</p><p>He reached the idea of back-typing keyboard through his business trip, and he found there is nothing like that. Finally, he decided to develop the back-typing keyboard by himself. He established T Solution Japan Corporation and T-BLADE project in 2015.</p><p>Under the strong leadership of Atsushi Miyajima, more than ten people joined the T-BLADE project. Members of the project include hardware engineer, software engineer, industrial designer and other creators.</p><p>Notably, Shige Aoki, chief industrial designer of the project, significantly contributed the overall product concept of T-BLADE. He created the stylish designs and superior operability of T-BLADE based on the thorough research of human engineering. As a result, T-BLADE is easy to use and functional enough with super stylish design.</p><p>We have been developing  T-BLADE since 2015 and now we have first proto-type products.</p><h3>Next Step</h3><p>Then in the next step, we need to prepare our mass-production line including molds of each components of T-BLADE since it is purely our original product.  That is why we conduct our campaign this time here at INDIEGOGO.</p><p>Your warm support makes our project successful.

However, in case of inputting longer texts, you may feel it’s not perfect.T-BLADE is a final solution for typing on iPad easily at anywhere and anytime. When you are in the car, in the train or in the airplane, you will be able to type on your iPad easily and comfortably by mounting T-BLADE. You can enjoy typing even in the narrow spaces.   T-BLADE EDITOR (under development) is the editing software of the dedicated T-BLADE.During the input, it looks like the back-typing keyboard is transparent.The text you type can be shared with other applications. In easily and timely manner, you will be able to send emails and also upload SNS like Facebook and Instagram.You can use various applications on your iPad with greater ease anywhere and anytime. If you have higher skills of input, the keyboard image on your screen can be smaller. You can switch off the function of the keyboard image on your screen if you want.Just using the software for a few days, and you will find yourself typing on T-BLADE with ease. Why We Try to Develop T-BLADE?Atsushi Miyajima, founder of T-BLADE project and T Solution Japan, usually spends one third of the year for overseas business trip. Through the business trip, he always felt that typing on iPad at the mobile situation is not easy and needs more efficient device for typing. He actually investigated compact and functional keyboard through the Internet. However, he could not find anything satisfactory. He bought a lot of keyboards but could not find best one.He reached the idea of back-typing keyboard through his business trip, and he found there is nothing like that. Finally, he decided to develop the back-typing keyboard by himself. He established T Solution Japan Corporation and T-BLADE project in 2015.Under the strong leadership of Atsushi Miyajima, more than ten people joined the T-BLADE project. Members of the project include hardware engineer, software engineer, industrial designer and other creators.Notably, Shige Aoki, chief industrial designer of the project, significantly contributed the overall product concept of T-BLADE. He created the stylish designs and superior operability of T-BLADE based on the thorough research of human engineering. As a result, T-BLADE is easy to use and functional enough with super stylish design.We have been developing  T-BLADE since 2015 and now we have first proto-type products.Next StepThen in the next step, we need to prepare our mass-production line including molds of each components of T-BLADE since it is purely our original product.  That is why we conduct our campaign this time here at INDIEGOGO.Your warm support makes our project successful.

One really nice feature is the ability to wear your phone with the camera facing out, for personal protection.  You can wear it when jogging, your child can wear it when they are walking home alone on a dark night or it might come in handy while in your car. 
Plus if your phone has a flashlight, which most do, you now have a flashlight which you don't have to hold or when you're taking a video of your family, friends or favorite places, your hands can still be free. Of course the same applies when using your new go pro, which is also able to be harnessed by your Palms Free device.

The Impact
The response to the prototype is overwhelming and when it is worn in the community, ""everyone wants one.""  One of our favorite quotes from someone in the community who saw our inventor wearing it, sums it up in one word,,,, ""Smart!"" It takes the place of all other hands free devices combined and it's uses and versatility are unsurpassed.  It can be worn everyday by anyone who needs a free hand.  The possibilities and  scenarios in which it can be worn are endless.

Risks & Challenges
The engineering is completed the tooling is done and the final prototype is finished. The product is made of the finest materials and special consideration has be made in this area including the use of stainless steel to provide customers with years of enjoyment. The idea is to have the product manufactured the ""right way"" the first time around and no known delays are anticipated. We strive for perfection and expect that every Palms Free harness will be free of imperfections and will be perfect in every way. In the strive for excellence,and the highest quality assurance, challenges could arise. If necessary, we have additional manufacturers lined up to meet and exceed customer expectations in this area and have additional resources set aside to ensure production is comprehensive and delivery is swift. Our backers are our priority. Our team of entrepreneurs encompasses a combined 40+ years of experience in the areas of operations, sales, and marketing, giving us the leading edge when it comes to providing products and services and an unsurpassed customer experience.

<p>My name is Muhire Louis-Antoine, founder and CEO  of MERGIMS. When I left my well paid job in Canada late 2014 to start MERGIMS in Rwanda it was because I realized that African Diaspora is stuck in a passive mode toward the economy of Africa, due to outdated traditional money transfer systems. <br/></p>
<p>For example,  the expensive and complicated process of sending money back to Africa won't allow African migrants to contribute efficiently to the well being of their relatives back home. <br/></p>
<p>Therefore, MERGIMS' mission is to directly connect diaspora to merchants in Africa, thus allowing instant transactions between them. Our vision, is to turn African migrants into true active players in the prosperity of Africa, thanks to internet. This can only be achieved by offering them convenient and affordable tools like our platform ""mergims"", available online and on mobile applications. (visit <a href=""http://www.mergims.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mergims.com</a>)<br/></p>
<p>In Rwanda, we started in 2015 with payment of urgent basic needs such as electricity or airtime and ever since we have more than 1000 active users taking care of their relatives in a convenient manner.<br/></p>
<p>This year, following many requests from our existing clients, we are launching disruptive and innovative services like payment of hospital bills and product called ''Instant Loans''.  </p>
<p></p>
<h3>How ""instant loans"" will work?<br/>
</h3>The migrant will be the guarantor of his relative in Rwanda, by simply making a deposit or using his debit or credit cards as collateral in our system. Once, his request submitted, ""mergims"" will instantly (literally in  less than a minute) send the money to the beneficiary via mobile money wallet (with terms and conditions such as interest rate and date to pay back the loan). <br/><br/>The beneficiary will have 30 to 60 days to repay back the loan to mergims' system using mobile money wallet (MTN, Tigo, Airtel) like if he or she was paying for any other service in Rwanda. If he or she has a smart phone or access to a computer, local credit and debit cards will be accepted by our mobile and online platforms. Once, the transaction is successfully closed, the guarantee will be released.<br/><br/> With this concept, not only we are enabling everyone in Rwanda to have access to quick and instant loans but our interest rate will always be 50% lower compared to the market.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get?<br/>
</h3>Technically, we are 90% ready. However we need $5000 USD minimum to launch our testing period from May to July 2016 with our existing clients. This is where the money raised from you will go!<br/><br/>As our way to thank you, you will be mentioned, if you want, on the cover page of that service, as the people who made it possible. Also, we will keep you informed in priority of new fundraising campaigns, in case you want to be more involved. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>Myself I lived outside Rwanda for more than 20 years and I had many of my cousins that wanted to start small business and needed small amount of money. I always felt bad when I couldn't help all of them because of limited funds. With this platform, people like me will be able to help more because one credit card can support more than one relative at affordable interest rate.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The way it is structured, there is no way we will lose your money, because when the relative defaults, there will always be a deposit or card to be charged. However, this product is new in Rwanda and regulation may take longer to approve our full launch after the testing period. Also, we may face a high demand of loans and not be able to serve all requests because of limited available funds in our system.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Murakoze ! (thank you very much) for reading and supporting us. Please, get the word out and make some noise about our campaign and together, let us give access to easy loans, at affordable interest rate, to everyone in Rwanda.<br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Our team came up with the notion after a business trip to Las Vegas, one of the most beautiful cities in the world. We appreciated the selfie stick (a traditional one) that one of us brought on the trip when we were touring around the city taking group selfies in front of those stunning sceneries in the city. Those selfies turned out to be pretty impressive. We were able to hold it out in front of us and get a quick snap to catch a passing by the cool scene when we were walking or in the car. We were able to raise it above our head and get the unique bird’s-eye view and also include everybody in the picture because you can lower it in front of you to show what's above you. You can use it to get a great shot of any significant event or experience. This trip inspired us that if the entire function of the selfie stick can be done with a touch of a button, it could change the world of selfie taking.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">After we had returned home, we started this project and turned this idea of a motorized selfie stick into a reality. We made it easy to control and wireless. Comparing with other selfie sticks, MP MyPole is user-friendly and straightforward. Anyone with the auto-extension selfie stick can take selfies in the best angle. Our team wants everyone in the world to be able to take the perfect selfie!  </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We want to talk about the risks and challenges in a little more detail than is typical for most Kickstarter projects. A lot of times teams default to high-level paragraphs without outlining what exactly might go wrong. We want to make sure our backers understand the complexity of manufacturing and the associated risks beforehand.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We’ve built and shipped hardware products before, and are familiar with the problems that may arise that could cause delays and impact delivery times. We’ve tried to make our delivery estimates as close to reality as possible by including ample buffer time into our timeline to take into account of unforeseen circumstances that could arise, but we can’t predict the future and foresee everything that might occur. Here are some of the most obvious potential risks, although the list is certainly not exhaustive.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">1. Tooling: Tooling is the process of making molds that eventually become pieces of the product. For us, tooling will be used to create the frames of the glasses. We’ve done our best to build room for tooling adjustments as well as mistakes into our timeline. It is possible that a part’s design may need to be adjusted, and that may take additional weeks or months to resolve. 3D printed and CNC prototypes are too different to perfectly represent an injection molded piece, and there may be unique challenges that we are unable to foresee. Tooling will also be happening around holiday season, which means factories may wind down production until after the holidays which could add to production time. We’ve already included buffer time to take this into account.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">2. Supply chain logistics: If we partner with a factory and order specific components to build a PCB (for example), it is possible that the factory may run low on parts or have long lead times for their inventory. This can hold up assembly, as you may imagine, since we can’t build a product if pieces are missing. Sometimes market forces change and can affect the supply of various components. If it is something we were waiting on, we will see longer lead times, and therefore delays.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">3. Certifications/Regulations: Since we are manufacturing electronics, there are various tests, including FCC and CE, that we will need to test. These tests often reveal design flaws that require changes in the design. Our timeline takes into account the potential need for retesting.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">4. Mistakes: At the end of the day, a lot of risks manifest from plain old mistakes. If we pick a plastic that ends up warping or becomes brittle during molding, we’ll have to change it. If we discover that a component fatigues during testing, it means we have to source a new one. If we fail various certifications, there may need to be redesigns in our electronics. We aren’t perfect, but we’re going to try our hardest to be as perfect as possible. We learned a lot from shipping our previous electronic devices, and we are confident that these experiences will help keep us on track.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Every company faces these challenges, but rarely do consumers see these challenges. Our biggest tool for battling these risks is having previous experience bringing prototypes from concept to full production, including working with contract manufacturers and shipping internationally. We know that building physical goods is a dynamic process with lots of room for hiccups along the way. We will keep an open dialogue with all of our backers through frequent, transparent, and thorough updates.</p>

<h3>A Video Game Console for Mobile Games</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622041915/pik5qygretxegkwhqglg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>We believe in two guiding ideas:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. Your smartphone is a supercomputer and has the potential to achieve more.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Big screen video gameplay should be less expensive and more accessible.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>How do we make those ideas a reality?</strong></h3>
<p>You are likely already carrying around super-computing power in your hand that rivals many traditional game consoles. AnyConsole™ can unlock that computing power and lets you play Android mobile games on a TV/monitor - <strong>with no visually perceptible latency</strong>.</p>
<div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/tOVGDS-UngA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div></div>
<p>With the AnyConsole, you can play mobile games on big screens with a controller or keyboard/mouse. It feels similar to a traditional video game console or a PC gaming experience, but you are actually playing your smartphone’s games! </p>
<p>This also means that you no longer need to pay $29-$59 for every video game. You now have the ability to play hundreds of thousands of free Android games on big screens!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622042402/kp5lrbq5kfpcnn53ouir.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Many people have attempted playing mobile games on big screens with other technologies. However, two technology shortfalls prevented this from happening: </p>
<p> <strong>• Screen mirroring latency problems (&gt; 1000ms) </strong></p>
<p><strong> • Peripheral device limitations (you have to use your phone for the controls) </strong></p>
<p>We solved these issues with:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Zero-latency ESM™ Technology</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, there are other technologies that can mirror your phone to a big screen, including Apple Airplay, Google Chromecast, and smart TV. But those methods all have significant latency issues. </p>
<p>As gamers ourselves, we know every millisecond matters when it comes to serious gaming. So we developed our own patented <strong>Electrical Spine Mirroring™ (ESM) </strong>technology that eliminated the latency problem. So you have immediate control of the battlefield.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Game Controller and Keyboard Support</strong></h3>
<p>Very few mobile games have integrated external controller support, which means even when you play mobile games on a TV with other technology, you still have to use your phone for the on-screen touch control. To solve this problem, we developed <strong>reverse control technology</strong>, which empowers you to play mobile games with a game controller (available for another $29) or keyboard &amp; mouse. </p>
<p>Our AI algorithm learns how your fingers control your phone, and it simulates the same actions (it's like virtual fingers floating on your phone's touchscreen).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622042565/xmiqu93z8lzdnsnn4dow.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>We love mobile games because we can play them on the go. We love console video games because we like to enjoy the immersive big-screen gaming experience. With the AnyConsole, you can have the best of both worlds. Enjoy a continuous gaming experience, no matter where you are.</p>
<p>With our AnyPNP™ technology, you can start a mobile game on your phone when you're outside and continue playing it on a TV when you get home in a seamless way.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.gifyu.com/images/Anyconsole-plug-n-play.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>AnyConsole works with all Android devices. Since AnyConsole uses your phone for computing power, every time you upgrade your Android phone, you also get your AnyConsole ready for the latest games.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622042859/gutvvjyh0vfu6u1gvzpd.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>While the price of most technology is steadily declining, we seem to keep paying more and more to big video game console companies for new hardware. Case in point, the new PlayStation 5 costs $100 more than the PlayStation 4. Besides, we need to pay $29-$59 for every new game.</p>
<p>We think it shouldn't have to be that way. We want gaming to be economically accessible for everyone. AnyConsole costs a fraction of what you'd spend for traditional consoles. <strong>And since most mobile games are free to play, you can also save hundreds on new games.</strong></p>
<p>          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.gifyu.com/images/ui-animation-2.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Many major game studios have already went “all-in” to design high-end gaming experiences for mobile (they make more from mobile games than they make from the console and PC games combined). Call of Duty: Mobile may have been the first of these big titles, but 2021 is already scheduled to be the year of big-name game titles from major game studios being designed for your phone. Expect mobile titles like ""Diablo Immortal, Apex Legends Mobile, Tomb Raider Reloaded, Path of Exile Mobile, and NieR Re[in]carnation to look great on your phone. We want your gaming experience to be better with a big screen and great sound.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622046634/nhirkxrox2vploctvqjo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Emulators are PC software that lets you run Android apps on a computer. Your computer is providing computing power. </p>
<p>The AnyConsole uses an AI algorithm that learns how your fingers control your phone, and it simulates the same thing to the game (it's like virtual fingers floating on your phone's touchscreen). In other words, the game is still running on your phone, so you don't get banned. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622048521/vjzzrwkpv6kdsloqthnq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We partnered with the experienced audio engineers at Kali Audio to develop the optimal sound for gaming. These respected industry veterans developed an entire acoustic system specifically for gaming and tuned the AnyConsole’s speakers into the optimal way to get the immersive sound for gaming. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622048622/zz5uuizzafetjusysmpj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>These speakers pack a punch for their size. In terms of specs, they have two 40-millimeter transducers and each of them delivers 8 watts of output (if you are not an audiophile that means AnyConsole is 5x more powerful than a JBL Clip 3). </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622048680/gaeuxcoj8ynisthqyyz3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">These speakers are small but ""mighty""</p>
<p>You can also use the AnyConsole as an attractive desktop phone charger/speaker. Want to use it as a smart speaker? Just enable your phone for voice commands with Google Assistant and say “Hey Google: play my “ Chill Super Mix” or other smart-speaker commands. The same could be done by enabling Alexa Hands-Free mode on your phone. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>Hardcore PC gamers swear by the ability to use keyboard and mouse control because of the speed and preciseness. Some mobile gamers wish to use a gamepad controller, so their thumb won't hurt from prolonged gaming. With the advent of the AnyConsole,  gamers now have the option of utilizing both types of control for their mobile games.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are an established company with a history of delivering computer hardware on a large scale worldwide. We are confident not only in our team, but also in our partners, supply chain, and logistics providers. We bring proven experience in designing, manufacturing, and fulfilling products (both crowdsourced and otherwise) to the table.</p>
<p>That said, even the biggest companies have some risks with bringing a new product through production and into the market. A shipping container could get hit by a storm. A natural disaster could take out one of our suppliers. Even in the event of a disaster, we are confident we have the experience and resources to overcome it. COVID-19 previously delayed our production schedule for our PhoneBook product fulfillment, but we beat the challenges presented and mass-produced our product.</p>
<p>During the fulfillment of all our crowdfunded products, we updated our backers regularly with our progress and challenges. We know how important communication is, and we pledge to be open and transparent with you to the best of our ability. We also commit to resolving fulfillment issues as rapidly as possible with all our resources.</p>
<p>We need your help to put AnyConsole into large-scale mass production, and we sincerely thank you for your support.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","A Video Game Console for Mobile Games
 

We believe in two guiding ideas:
1. Your smartphone is a supercomputer and has the potential to achieve more.
2. Big screen video gameplay should be less expensive and more accessible.
How do we make those ideas a reality?
You are likely already carrying around super-computing power in your hand that rivals many traditional game consoles. AnyConsole™ can unlock that computing power and lets you play Android mobile games on a TV/monitor - with no visually perceptible latency.

With the AnyConsole, you can play mobile games on big screens with a controller or keyboard/mouse. It feels similar to a traditional video game console or a PC gaming experience, but you are actually playing your smartphone’s games! 
This also means that you no longer need to pay $29-$59 for every video game. You now have the ability to play hundreds of thousands of free Android games on big screens!
 

Many people have attempted playing mobile games on big screens with other technologies. However, two technology shortfalls prevented this from happening: 
 • Screen mirroring latency problems (> 1000ms) 
 • Peripheral device limitations (you have to use your phone for the controls) 
We solved these issues with:
1. Zero-latency ESM™ Technology
Yes, there are other technologies that can mirror your phone to a big screen, including Apple Airplay, Google Chromecast, and smart TV. But those methods all have significant latency issues. 
As gamers ourselves, we know every millisecond matters when it comes to serious gaming. So we developed our own patented Electrical Spine Mirroring™ (ESM) technology that eliminated the latency problem. So you have immediate control of the battlefield.
2. Game Controller and Keyboard Support
Very few mobile games have integrated external controller support, which means even when you play mobile games on a TV with other technology, you still have to use your phone for the on-screen touch control. To solve this problem, we developed reverse control technology, which empowers you to play mobile games with a game controller (available for another $29) or keyboard & mouse. 
Our AI algorithm learns how your fingers control your phone, and it simulates the same actions (it's like virtual fingers floating on your phone's touchscreen).

 



We love mobile games because we can play them on the go. We love console video games because we like to enjoy the immersive big-screen gaming experience. With the AnyConsole, you can have the best of both worlds. Enjoy a continuous gaming experience, no matter where you are.
With our AnyPNP™ technology, you can start a mobile game on your phone when you're outside and continue playing it on a TV when you get home in a seamless way.

AnyConsole works with all Android devices. Since AnyConsole uses your phone for computing power, every time you upgrade your Android phone, you also get your AnyConsole ready for the latest games.

While the price of most technology is steadily declining, we seem to keep paying more and more to big video game console companies for new hardware. Case in point, the new PlayStation 5 costs $100 more than the PlayStation 4. Besides, we need to pay $29-$59 for every new game.
We think it shouldn't have to be that way. We want gaming to be economically accessible for everyone. AnyConsole costs a fraction of what you'd spend for traditional consoles. And since most mobile games are free to play, you can also save hundreds on new games.
          
Many major game studios have already went “all-in” to design high-end gaming experiences for mobile (they make more from mobile games than they make from the console and PC games combined). Call of Duty: Mobile may have been the first of these big titles, but 2021 is already scheduled to be the year of big-name game titles from major game studios being designed for your phone. Expect mobile titles like ""Diablo Immortal, Apex Legends Mobile, Tomb Raider Reloaded, Path of Exile Mobile, and NieR Re[in]carnation to look great on your phone. We want your gaming experience to be better with a big screen and great sound.
 

 
Emulators are PC software that lets you run Android apps on a computer. Your computer is providing computing power. 
The AnyConsole uses an AI algorithm that learns how your fingers control your phone, and it simulates the same thing to the game (it's like virtual fingers floating on your phone's touchscreen). In other words, the game is still running on your phone, so you don't get banned. 
 

 
We partnered with the experienced audio engineers at Kali Audio to develop the optimal sound for gaming. These respected industry veterans developed an entire acoustic system specifically for gaming and tuned the AnyConsole’s speakers into the optimal way to get the immersive sound for gaming. 

These speakers pack a punch for their size. In terms of specs, they have two 40-millimeter transducers and each of them delivers 8 watts of output (if you are not an audiophile that means AnyConsole is 5x more powerful than a JBL Clip 3). 

These speakers are small but ""mighty""
You can also use the AnyConsole as an attractive desktop phone charger/speaker. Want to use it as a smart speaker? Just enable your phone for voice commands with Google Assistant and say “Hey Google: play my “ Chill Super Mix” or other smart-speaker commands. The same could be done by enabling Alexa Hands-Free mode on your phone. 
 

Hardcore PC gamers swear by the ability to use keyboard and mouse control because of the speed and preciseness. Some mobile gamers wish to use a gamepad controller, so their thumb won't hurt from prolonged gaming. With the advent of the AnyConsole,  gamers now have the option of utilizing both types of control for their mobile games.

Use a Game Controller
 

Game Like the Pros With a Mouse & Keyboard


AnyConsole isn’t just for gaming. It has screen mirroring capabilities too for much of the content you love to watch on your phone. You can use it as a streaming box to play your favorite YouTube videos, stream Twitch, browse TikTok, watch TV shows** – all on the big screen in 4K*.
*AnyConsole supports up to 4K resolution in theater mode. The final resolution might be limited by your phone's resolution.
**Platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video do not allow Digital Rights Management Content to be screen mirrored.


Our engineers take a great deal of pride in the innovative design details on the AnyConsole and that innovation didn’t stop with the development of the AnyConsole’s new speakers. They also considered chord storage and came up with a clever and unique way to store the AnyConsole’s power chord’s for a cleaner look and easier transportation.

</div></div>","The BikeShield is a Road Safety App that prevents collisions by sending acoustic warnings to motorists when bicycles or motorcycles are nearby.
The BikeShield is a First Layer Crash Avoidance Technology adding a preliminary and additional protection layer to any other safety system incorporated in your vehicle.    
Take a look to the great coverage of the BikeShield on ABC 7 News and other amazing media platforms:  



        
   

Why a Mobile App?Smart phones have all the required technology to connect different vehicles on the road: GPS, internet, accelerometer, device-to-device communication systems, etc. Most importantly, it doesn't matter if you are driving an old car or riding an old bicycle, almost everyone carries one. Phone technology has become a Universal Communication Platform.


Who are we?



The BikeShield was developed by the TDG Company, a startup created in 2014 by a group of enthusiastic people who love bicycles, motorcycles, and above all safety. The TDG Company includes people from Los Angeles (California, US), Guadalajara (Jalisco, MEX) and Barcelona (Catalunya, Spain) who rode all over the world.
Version 1.0 was launched in September 2014 on iOS and Android platforms. It evolved to version 2.1 which includes automatic activation, trip reports and interactive maps to help determine safer routes.  The BikeShield Community is over 3,000 street users.
                         



Why do we need your help?
The BikeShield is FREE and will remain free. But we need your help to keep going. 

We need your collaboration to achieve wide scale adoption and to develop the BikeShield Version 3.0, which will be even more reliable. The new version will use minimal battery power and it will connect bikes with more types of vehicles on the road: cars, taxis, buses, etc. It will also include really cool features like real-time visualization of your friends on the map to check their ride, meet up with them and make sure they are safe. 


                                 





We believe that road safety is as much of a right as it is a responsibility so there is no room for exclusivity. Therefore, it is important for us to open the BikeShield communication channel to existing community efforts and infrastructure. These programs and communities include:



BIKE SHARE PROGRAMS: Bike share programs with their own apps can be equipped with the BikeShield.  We have partnered with MiBici in Guadalajara, Mexico, which will become the most advanced bike share program in the World by incorporating the BikeShield B2V Communication System. With your help, we will expand this model to your city's bike share program and programs across the world.



ROAD APPS AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS:  We are now opening our Bike-2-Vehicle (B2V) communication channels to the most popular road and navigation apps so everyone using them will sense you when riding nearby. This is one of our ultimate goals and with your help we'll get there.  

PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION:  Buses prove to be a unique challenge for sharing the road because they often drive in and out of bike lanes to reach sidewalk bus stops. Their large size and limited view often makes it difficult for bus drivers to cyclists. That’s why we have developed the BikeShield BUS for bus drivers.

Wives and kids are usually hard to satisfy, but Lighty was made by using input from them! So whenever daylight doesn't let you actually watch full-wall movies, Lighty acts as an Internet radio, with over 8 hours of autonomy.

<h2><strong>Lighty solves three big issues with projectors nowadays:</strong></h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The lack of a good integrated sound system</li>
<li><span>To see a projector movie, you need a bag of cables: power cord, HDMI cable, speakers, laptop or tablet and let's not forget you need to be near a power outlet.</span></li>
<li>For ceiling projections, you need a good tripod, which makes for a not-very-mobile setup.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lighty has none of these problems. </strong>Its integrated speakers are powerful enough to fill a mid-sized room with high-quality sound, and it doesn't need anything else to run than maybe your phone - everyone carries it around. </p>
<p>Moreover, when you put your phone on Lighty's support, it charges wirelessly and mirrors the screen through WiFi, without needing a router.</p>
<h2><strong>But Lighty has more:</strong></h2>
<div>
<strong>No other projector can rotate, tilt and park itself to save space and give you 360/90 degrees of freedom.</strong><p></p>
<p><strong>Because it uses a laser projector, Lighty doesn't need image focusing</strong> - the picture is just as crisp on any surface at any distance.</p>
<p><strong>Lighty </strong><b>automatically </b><b>levels the projected image </b>when placed on uneven surfaces. If you don't like horizontal, there's a manual control for that, too.</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<b>You can turn it off without touching it</b> - at all - it's equipped with a proximity sensor that senses when your hand is in front of it - and turns off projection.<p></p>
<p><b>Lighty knows the room it's in and remembers the last settings - </b>through NFC patches<b>.</b></p>

<h3>Powerful pico projector</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.getlighty.com/wp-content/features/projector.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;width: 339.327px;height: 204px;margin-right:20px;""/>Lighty has an HD <b>laser projector</b> that can easily replace your TV or computer screen. The best part is that you can put up images on any surface, anytime, with unprecedented ease.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>360º/90<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">º </span>Panoramic Movement</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.getlighty.com/wp-content/features/lighty-spinning.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 336px;height: 252px;float: left;margin-right:20px;""/>The projector in Lighty can tilt, rotate and park itself behind the screen, thus giving you the freedom to put your movie or TV show on any wall or surface! It also remembers the last couple of settings, and restores them the next time you want to watch something.<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>One Trackball</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.getlighty.com/wp-content/features/biluta.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;margin-right:20px;""/>In an early iteration, the projector inside Lighty needed no less than 6 buttons to rotate, tilt, get in or out of its shell. Now, the only illuminated ""ball"" it has gives you natural and intuitive freedom of accessing even the most intricate of its functions.<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Voice Recognition</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.getlighty.com/wp-content/features/voice-control.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;margin-right:20px;""/>This is how you can control the way Lighty moves, on which wall it puts the image, whether you want to turn it on or off, and many others, for times when you don't have your hands free.<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Haptic Control (DoubleTap)</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.getlighty.com/wp-content/features/haptic.gif"" src="""" style=""float: left;margin-right:20px;""/>Just tap Lighty twice and it will come up, ready to charm you with a projection, on any wall, remembering its last position. Tap it twice again and it will go back to its (mobile) home.<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Focus-Free</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.getlighty.com/wp-content/features/focus.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;margin-right:20px;""/>Because Lighty uses a laser projector, you don't have to touch a thing to focus the picture, when you move your projection from one place to another. Images will always be crisp and clear - instantly.<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Automatic Leveling</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.getlighty.com/wp-content/features/auto-projector-level.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;margin-right:20px;""/>If it's placed on an uneven surface, Lighty will self-adjust the horizontal image position, so you don't have to work hard to put stuff underneath it. This function can be manually overriden (in case you prefer a tilted image).<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Silent on/off</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.getlighty.com/wp-content/features/silent-off.gif"" src="""" style=""float: left;margin-right:20px;""/>Should your dear ones fall asleep during the movie (it happens to everyone), you can stop the projection without making any noise whatsoever. Simply, just put your hand in front of the projector and light stops flowing. If you do this with the projector already off, it'll turn the image on. What more can you want?</span></div>
<div>
<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>High-Quality Sound</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.getlighty.com/wp-content/features/speaker.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;margin-right:20px;""/>Because tablets and pico-projectors don't usually have very good sound systems, we included nice-sounding speakers, so you can enjoy the most cinema-like experiences.<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Wireless Connectivity</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.getlighty.com/wp-content/features/wireless.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;margin-right:20px;""/>Lighty has Bluetooth and WiFi, for you to play music and movies straight from your phone or tablet. It can also be connected to already-existing Bluetooth speakers you may have around.<p></p>

<div>The contraption above is the first projector tilting mechanism. I used a servo motor, with the commands fed from an infrared remote control. You can call it ""the first prototype."" Later on, I ditched the infrared module in favor of wireless communications. <b>If you'd like to see infrared come back on board, please shout.</b>

<i>One late night while working on the Lighty prototype.</i>
</div>
<div>Currently, the Lighty prototype is powered by a quad core processor. However, the final, commercial version will feature an <b>octa-core ARM processor and video accelerator, </b>enough to meet the demands of any movie watching freak.</div>

<h1>Lighty is green</h1>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/844546/files/20140909033840-eyeless-greenopt-logo-200.png?1410259120"" src="""" style=""width: 262.299px;height: 261px;float: right;""/>

Since it doesn't use much electricity to run and effectively replaces the TV (we ditched it at home), Lighty is the greenest piece of internet-connected, digital entertainment device you can have around.

</div>
<div>One other reason for its eco-consciousness is that it uses far fewer materials than a TV ever will, no matter how ""green"" they say it is.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Where possible, we use 3D-printed parts made from corn (PLA), to lower our carbon footprint and make small-batch production possible. Huge factories are so yesterday! Bioplastics such as PLA (polylactic acid) are even stronger than regular, petroleum-based plastics.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<div><br/></div>
<h1>$50,000</h1>
Will implement Leap Motion functionality in all Lighties sold. Which means you'll be able to do magic: you'll get Lighty out from its shell just by a dragging gesture in the air, and position the image by waving your hand above it, very precisely.</div>
<div>  <h1>$100,000</h1>
Lighty will be able to work with the Myo armband, which is even more magic than the Leap Motion - it reads your muscles and guesses the hand movements and gestures.</div>
<div>  <h1>$500,000</h1>
You'll be able to combine two or more Lighties to make proportionally-bigger images. They'll sync together automatically and you'll have huge-screen cinema really anywhere.
<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>$1,000,000</h1>
Laser shows will be nothing out of the ordinary for Lighty. We have plans for a new model where more projectors join and create holograms and real daydreams... but can't say more about this. We need serious money to develop this. Support us.</div>

The New Lighty







This is the new Lighty. It has a 50 lumen HD projector, it's smaller than ever and appreciated by everyone at Bucharest Technology Week. Will update the specs in the following weeks.

  

 



“Lighty opens up imagination on the possibility of future smart entertainment experience. “
Josh Liu, Managing Director at HardwarePro


 

 

  

  

""It can follow you anywhere and anytime, it can become indispensable. Lighty is not just a product, it's a story. With our help it will become a success story.""
Dan Calugareanu, CEO at Alliance Computers

 






 



Lighty is world's first robotic HD laser projection system that blends the sweetness of a true movie-watching experience with the latest hi-tech candies invented. It is the next best thing to cinema - only that it fits in your pocket.





Ceiling Movies




 
Open-air gaming


 

The prototype of Lighty can play video through the projector for 5 continuous hours while on battery, or internet radio for about 10 hours. If plugged into its power supply,  you can just set it and forget it - the laser LED source is guaranteed for over 20,000 hours.
  




Internet radio

 
Apps like TuneIn  or Pandora unleash the beauty of online radio, as you can listen to stations from all around the world, in your kitchen, or on the deck, anywhere.

 


Family entertainment




Wives and kids are usually hard to satisfy, but Lighty was made by using input from them! So whenever daylight doesn't let you actually watch full-wall movies, Lighty acts as an Internet radio, with over 8 hours of autonomy.


Office presentations








Lighty fits perfectly in any office - you can do business presentations on any wall, anywhere, without setting up laptops or projectors and power cables throughout the room. You will be able to pause the projection when doing behind-the-scenes work by just putting your hand in front of the projector, and resuming it the same way.

   Gadget Testing Platform


Lighty already supports interaction with gadgets like the Leap Motion controller. They can help you control the projector wirelessly, use gestures to manipulate presentations or movies and, why not, show off!



Lighty solves three big issues with projectors nowadays:


The lack of a good integrated sound system
To see a projector movie, you need a bag of cables: power cord, HDMI cable, speakers, laptop or tablet and let's not forget you need to be near a power outlet.
For ceiling projections, you need a good tripod, which makes for a not-very-mobile setup.

Lighty has none of these problems. Its integrated speakers are powerful enough to fill a mid-sized room with high-quality sound, and it doesn't need anything else to run than maybe your phone - everyone carries it around. 
Moreover, when you put your phone on Lighty's support, it charges wirelessly and mirrors the screen through WiFi, without needing a router.
But Lighty has more:

No other projector can rotate, tilt and park itself to save space and give you 360/90 degrees of freedom.
Because it uses a laser projector, Lighty doesn't need image focusing - the picture is just as crisp on any surface at any distance.
Lighty automatically levels the projected image when placed on uneven surfaces. If you don't like horizontal, there's a manual control for that, too.



You can turn it off without touching it - at all - it's equipped with a proximity sensor that senses when your hand is in front of it - and turns off projection.
Lighty knows the room it's in and remembers the last settings - through NFC patches.


   













Powerful pico projector
Lighty has an HD laser projector that can easily replace your TV or computer screen. The best part is that you can put up images on any surface, anytime, with unprecedented ease.





360º/90º Panoramic Movement
The projector in Lighty can tilt, rotate and park itself behind the screen, thus giving you the freedom to put your movie or TV show on any wall or surface! It also remembers the last couple of settings, and restores them the next time you want to watch something.



One Trackball
In an early iteration, the projector inside Lighty needed no less than 6 buttons to rotate, tilt, get in or out of its shell. Now, the only illuminated ""ball"" it has gives you natural and intuitive freedom of accessing even the most intricate of its functions.


Voice Recognition
This is how you can control the way Lighty moves, on which wall it puts the image, whether you want to turn it on or off, and many others, for times when you don't have your hands free.



Haptic Control (DoubleTap)
Just tap Lighty twice and it will come up, ready to charm you with a projection, on any wall, remembering its last position. Tap it twice again and it will go back to its (mobile) home.



Focus-Free
Because Lighty uses a laser projector, you don't have to touch a thing to focus the picture, when you move your projection from one place to another. Images will always be crisp and clear - instantly.



Automatic Leveling
If it's placed on an uneven surface, Lighty will self-adjust the horizontal image position, so you don't have to work hard to put stuff underneath it. This function can be manually overriden (in case you prefer a tilted image).


Silent on/off
Should your dear ones fall asleep during the movie (it happens to everyone), you can stop the projection without making any noise whatsoever. Simply, just put your hand in front of the projector and light stops flowing. If you do this with the projector already off, it'll turn the image on. What more can you want?



High-Quality Sound
Because tablets and pico-projectors don't usually have very good sound systems, we included nice-sounding speakers, so you can enjoy the most cinema-like experiences.





Wireless Connectivity
Lighty has Bluetooth and WiFi, for you to play music and movies straight from your phone or tablet. It can also be connected to already-existing Bluetooth speakers you may have around.




Lighty is very, very flexible in operation because it has Android at its core. 


You don't even have to be in the same building, town or country! Just stream your content and voice through the Internet and put Lighty on any wall you like, remotely. And you don't need expensive TVs or complex video conferencing systems for that. Lighty will do the job.




Timeline






Awards and Recognitions




 
So far, Lighty has won a 10,000 Euro grant from Innovation Norway, the ""Advanced Track"" award from Orange Innovation Labs and was highly appreciated by the visitors of the Startup Spotlight conference in November 2015. We've also attended the Vienna Maker Faire in April, and had more than 200 visitors at our booth admiring Lighty and the new laser projector.

Developing the prototype



It all started with this:

The contraption above is the first projector tilting mechanism. I used a servo motor, with the commands fed from an infrared remote control. You can call it ""the first prototype."" Later on, I ditched the infrared module in favor of wireless communications. If you'd like to see infrared come back on board, please shout.

 


One late night while working on the Lighty prototype.

Currently, the Lighty prototype is powered by a quad core processor. However, the final, commercial version will feature an octa-core ARM processor and video accelerator, enough to meet the demands of any movie watching freak.

 The projector in the Lighty prototype is now a modified (hacked) Samsung EAD-R10 with a 640x360 resolution, but the commercial version will contain a WiFi-enabled laser projector with a 720p resolution and 50 laser lumens.


The new look
Lighty's new look - this is the concept of the version backers will receive. The projector in the middle will tilt and the entire platform will rotate. The entire design is more solid and critical moving parts made from 2mm thick aluminum.




Lighty is green



Since it doesn't use much electricity to run and effectively replaces the TV (we ditched it at home), Lighty is the greenest piece of internet-connected, digital entertainment device you can have around.


One other reason for its eco-consciousness is that it uses far fewer materials than a TV ever will, no matter how ""green"" they say it is.

Where possible, we use 3D-printed parts made from corn (PLA), to lower our carbon footprint and make small-batch production possible. Huge factories are so yesterday! Bioplastics such as PLA (polylactic acid) are even stronger than regular, petroleum-based plastics.





Stretch Goals

$50,000
Will implement Leap Motion functionality in all Lighties sold. Which means you'll be able to do magic: you'll get Lighty out from its shell just by a dragging gesture in the air, and position the image by waving your hand above it, very precisely.
  $100,000
Lighty will be able to work with the Myo armband, which is even more magic than the Leap Motion - it reads your muscles and guesses the hand movements and gestures.
  $500,000
You'll be able to combine two or more Lighties to make proportionally-bigger images. They'll sync together automatically and you'll have huge-screen cinema really anywhere.

$1,000,000
Laser shows will be nothing out of the ordinary for Lighty. We have plans for a new model where more projectors join and create holograms and real daydreams... but can't say more about this. We need serious money to develop this. Support us.

The Team

Ovidiu Sandru - founder & hardware dev- Ovidiu has had a crush on electronics and programming since the age of 5. He left the corporate world of HP to work on his startup (and generally live life to the fullest). He now has a constant stream of ideas that he dreams to bring life to.



Adrian Serban - sound engineering - a music and electronics lover, Adrian has been an entrepreneur when few people really knew what tech entrepreneurship was.




Mike Sandru - graphic design - drawing his way to success, Mike's passion is to create visual art for various companies on his 27"" Wacom tablet. His ideas are highly appreciated by thousands around the world. Maybe you've seen one of his works on some bus in London, these days.



Andreea Sandru - beta tester - a talented actress, but nevertheless with a crush on Lighty, and one of the founders of the idea that movies are better if watched on the ceiling.




Mary Sandru - crash testing and model - having crashed Lighty multiple times, Mary likes to watch cartoons and brag with it to her friends. She suggested at least one feature of Lighty (like the DoubleTap) and, despite her age, has discovered a few unobvious bugs. For that matter, Lighty protects itself by automatically retracting the projector very quickly in the case of a drop.

<p>MyEnergo is service where you can rent out battery packs from
a kiosk at any time of the day any where in your city. When you have a low or dead
battery look for a MyEnergo kiosk, obtain a battery pack from the kiosk and
recharge your device. Once the battery pack has fully charged your device, return the battery pack to the kiosk. Use MyEnergo services
every time you’re in need of a recharge boost.</p>
<p>By helping out our campaign you can make these services
available nationwide. Imagine MyEnergo kiosks in every airport, city and
amusement park that you visit!</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>MyEnergo campaign is asking for forty thousand dollars. Once our goal has been reached the funds will be used to start the engineering process that will custom make kiosks
needed to start MyEnergo. We will start with a minimum order of kiosks and
launch the business in the city where the most votes are collected. If we were to collect more than the
amount asked for, then we will also try to start business in the second city
with the most votes. </p>
<p>You can vote for your city by contributing to our perks. The
higher the perk the more votes you put in! The more votes in from your city the
faster MyEnergo services will arrive at your home town, so do not forget to
share this campaign on all your favorite social media sites.  </p>
<p>For any reason we do not reach our goal, any amount collected
will be used for research of a simpler kiosk design which we would start in the
city with the most votes. </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We greatly appreciate your contribution to our project and
by helping to the cause you are eliminating the hassle of running out of
battery in the times you need it most. No more plugging in to walls, no more
looking for free outlets to plug into. No more preparing for trips with extra
devices to carry along and no more buying expensive external batteries.</p>
<p>We all want MyEnergo to become a reality nationwide. Anywhere  any time and every time you need a battery boost we want to be there; at your
schools, out in your city, traveling on the road, in every airport, and in every amusement
park you visit! With your help we can make this a reality. </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
MyEnergo is service where you can rent out battery packs from
a kiosk at any time of the day any where in your city. When you have a low or dead
battery look for a MyEnergo kiosk, obtain a battery pack from the kiosk and
recharge your device. Once the battery pack has fully charged your device, return the battery pack to the kiosk. Use MyEnergo services
every time you’re in need of a recharge boost.
By helping out our campaign you can make these services
available nationwide. Imagine MyEnergo kiosks in every airport, city and
amusement park that you visit!

  What We Need & What You Get
MyEnergo campaign is asking for forty thousand dollars. Once our goal has been reached the funds will be used to start the engineering process that will custom make kiosks
needed to start MyEnergo. We will start with a minimum order of kiosks and
launch the business in the city where the most votes are collected. If we were to collect more than the
amount asked for, then we will also try to start business in the second city
with the most votes. 
You can vote for your city by contributing to our perks. The
higher the perk the more votes you put in! The more votes in from your city the
faster MyEnergo services will arrive at your home town, so do not forget to
share this campaign on all your favorite social media sites.  
For any reason we do not reach our goal, any amount collected
will be used for research of a simpler kiosk design which we would start in the
city with the most votes. 

  The Impact
We greatly appreciate your contribution to our project and
by helping to the cause you are eliminating the hassle of running out of
battery in the times you need it most. No more plugging in to walls, no more
looking for free outlets to plug into. No more preparing for trips with extra
devices to carry along and no more buying expensive external batteries.
We all want MyEnergo to become a reality nationwide. Anywhere  any time and every time you need a battery boost we want to be there; at your
schools, out in your city, traveling on the road, in every airport, and in every amusement
park you visit! With your help we can make this a reality. 

  Risks & Challenges
Like any other project we face some challenges, first it
would be reaching our goal on Indiegogo,  then the only challenge would be  establishing a headquarter in the city with the most
votes. Lastly, what concerns us is deciding which manufacture would be
the best choice to do business with in developing the kiosks.

<p>Well, MARRIAGE equality, in the USA is here, but while this ruling is an enormous leap forward for the global LGBTQ community, <b>we may have won the ""Love Battle"" in the USA, but the ""Equality War"" rages on worldwide.</b></p>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In 30 of the 50 United States, it is <i>STILL</i> LEGAL to fire or deny housing </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">to LGBTQ citizens based on sexuality or gender identity.</span></span>

</ul>
<p>Those who lost on the same-sex ruling have already started to shout back in the name of Religious Freedom.  So now is the time to continue the wave of momentum created by the same-sex marriage ruling and double down our efforts to finish the job of obtaining full equality!   </p>

Communication is power. Imagine a global, mobile communications network, operated by the LGBTQ community, that has the power to rapidly effect incredible change and to make equality a reality. 
With the landmark United States Supreme Court's decision on June 26, it may look like we've done it;  Equality is here!


Well, MARRIAGE equality, in the USA is here, but while this ruling is an enormous leap forward for the global LGBTQ community, we may have won the ""Love Battle"" in the USA, but the ""Equality War"" rages on worldwide.
Consider this:



In 30 of the 50 United States, it is STILL LEGAL to fire or deny housing to LGBTQ citizens based on sexuality or gender identity.

STILL, 41% of transgender people have attempted suicide, compared with 1.6% of the general population - while 78% who had endured physical or sexual violence at school had attempted suicide.
Of the 1.6 million homeless American youth, STILL, UP TO 40% identify as LGBTQ.  
26% of teens who came out to their parents are told to leave home. 
LGBTQ youth are STILL FOUR TIMES more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers
With the Court's ruling, there are 18 countries who recognize same-sex marriage but there are STILL over 45 countries where expressing your love for a same-sex partner will result in imprisonment or even death.

We are a team of very experienced individuals who have gone through the mobile device product development and go to market process more than once. Unforeseen things sometimes happen, but we are convinced that we can begin to sell, ship and support customers within 90 - 120days of completing this campaign (October/ November 2015).  We'd like to be OUT in full force at Atlanta Pride - October 10-11th.  
The biggest risk eliminators are our initial inventory order of SIM cards, completing our registration with individual state Public Utility Commissions (PUCs), and final billing system software integration and deployment.  This is why we need funding of more than $50.000. Every additional cent makes it safer.  We continue to look for raise to reduce these costs or establish other means to pay for these expenses in order to reduce the risk of our launch.

partner, best friend, confidante and wife, had a heart attack (her main heart arteries
suddenly blocked), which then induced a cardiac arrest (her heart stopped!)
from ventricular fibrillation (that is, the heart’s electrical signals
stopped).</p>
<p>At the time, we were lying in bed, watching TV at the foot
of the bed, and both pottering (I should have been studying for an Operations
Management exam) and reading on our iPads. I was debating with myself about
whether to go downstairs and clean up the garage versus continuing to ’bludge’
in bed.</p>
<p>I then heard her make a clucking sound, like our chickens in
Fiji used to do, so didn't take notice straight away, as I thought she was
‘bunging’ it on at first, to be humorous.</p>
<p>Then her head fell to the side with her tongue slightly
hanging outside her mouth, almost like you see when kids fake being shot and
dying.</p>
<p>I then started to panic, and ran around the bed to try and
understand what was going on – as Sarah has type 1 diabetes, I at first thought
maybe it was hypoglycaemic shock, and was frantically thinking about whether I
could find the Glucogon pen, or Epi Pen, and whether I would be able to ‘stab
it in’?</p>
<p>So I checked to see if she was dripping sweat, and she
wasn't, so now I knew this wasn't related to her blood sugars, as when she is typically
‘low’.</p>
<p>Her clucking sounds were coming every now and then, and this
later I was to discover was Sarah trying to breathe.</p>
<p>I now went into a complete Funk – Freeze, Flight and Fight.
First I wanted to scream and have somebody come save me – but there was no one,
as we live in a very quiet apartment block. I started blubbering like a little
girl, and ran up and down on the same spot as if trying to run away.</p>
<p>It should be appreciated that my understandable ‘freaking
out’ was surprising, considering my many (30+) years of managing and dealing
with sensory overload from so called risky sports of hang gliding, motorbike
racing and skydiving.</p>
<p>I snapped out of it when I realised I needed to put some
pants on – my family, very much later laughed at this (I wasn't known as the
naked gardner in Fiji for nothing) – but this physical, practical, unrelated to
the emergency action, made me start to react proactively.</p>
<p>So, I raced back around the bed to hunt for my phone, which
had fallen behind the bed earlier that afternoon, lamenting iPhone pass codes,
and called 000 emergency. (Maybe a voice override recognition emergency option
would be a good idea?)</p>
<p>I got straight through, and the calm reassuring emergency
responder person, began me on my way to getting Sarah from the bed to the
carpet. </p>
<p>This proved challenging, as anyone who has tried to move a
prone body will know. She had part fallen between the bedside drawers and bed,
so was becoming wedged, and suspended mid air as the bedside drawer moved to
jam the bedroom door on the cat play stand against the wall – an unbelievable nightmare!</p>
<p>With extreme adrenaline supported effort, I managed to get
the non breathing Sarah on the floor.</p>
<p>So here I was blubbering like a stuck pig, phone in one hand
to ear, and beginning a lame one handed CPR on Sarah. The operator did not want
to let me put the phone down, I guess in case she lost me. But I put it down,
hit the speaker, and then began some serious two handed CPR, hoping like hell
it was in the optimum location. </p>
<p>Lots of people say it should be to the beat of the BeeGees
‘Staying Alive’, but I can tell you, all I did was do it as fast as I could,
which was about 2 compresses every second. There were no dam tunes going
through my mind, BeeGees or otherwise.</p>
<p>I lost all sense of time, and even now couldn't tell you how
long it took me to begin CPR – in the days that followed, by visualising what I
remember doing, I estimate it was 2 minutes, but it could have been 30 seconds
or 30 minutes. I will never know!</p>
<p>From my phone call, to the paramedics arriving was
documented as 6 minutes – remarkable, fantastic, fortunate coincidence, as the
wonderful NSW Paramedics happened to be very close by. Usually it is around 11
minutes, but of course can be up to 30 minutes in extreme cases in traffic,
excess  demand etc.</p>
<p>They were followed closely by the volunteer Hatzolah
Paramedics that primarily attended cardiac arrest cases – one of only two
suburbs in Sydney which have this valuable, dedicated service, sponsored by the
generous Jewish community. </p>
<p>They took over from me, a sweaty, blubbering mess.</p>
<p>They administered an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) shock, but as it was
now 8 or 9 minutes, they had to continue CPR for another 25 minutes, and I like
to think that my sorry traumatised condition spurred them on for longer than
they normally might have. (An AED needs to be administered within the first 5
minutes, as after this time it becomes increasingly less likely to revive
someone.)</p>
<p>They eventually, miraculously brought her back, and after
some time got her stable and started the Herculean task of getting her down
three flights of stairs unconscious in a stretcher.</p>
<p>The seven paramedics were great, constantly reassuring me,
and I didn't notice at the time, but Sarah’s mum observed them giving high
fives in the street, whilst Sarah and I were loaded up into two separate ‘ambo’s’ (ambulances).</p>
<p>It turns out that they had been unable to revive and save
the previous 28 cardiac arrest victims. Cardiac arrest is a ‘mongrel’ (horrible
human tragedy!) It strikes instantly, often without warning,  and is almost certainly fatal, particularly if
no early intervention, within seconds - not minutes or hours.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431140395/rkyomdquohlx1ocpvcvd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Sarah’s miracle continued. So far, the stars had aligned, with
me coming to my senses and calling emergency services, then performing CPR (not
sure how effective it was),
emergency services answering immediately (on a Saturday night!), the paramedics
life saving rapid response, and then having world class on call, ready to go, cardiac surgeons
at St Vincents hospital – one of only two teams ready at separate Sydney hospitals available for
unscheduled cardiac surgery emergency. (A young man in his late twenties had a
cardiac arrest at the same time, and was sent to the other hospital, Royal
Prince of Wales – he died on the surgery table).</p>
<p>She received two stents in her primary heart artery, and
spent the next 14 days in intensive care in a coma. The attending doctors were
not sure how much brain injury she had sustained, and I was petrified that her
personality, and her ‘brain the size of a planet’ might be compromised. Many of
her friends (very much later), joked that if she lost half her brains, she
still would be smarter than most people.</p>
<p>When Sarah ‘woke’ up from her coma, although she had by this
stage had her ventilator tube replaced by a tracheotomy, (so she still couldn't
talk), she lit up when I walked into the ICU. (After Day four, a particular
Doctor I nicknamed Dr. Doom, continually suggested that as each day passed, we
were increasingly likely to get a zucchini back, and not our Sarah.)</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431140462/wnwhexwmhbac1oz7dkx6.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p><p>I knew she was back, albeit with her side trek to hell, and the joy I felt
at her recognising me, and with an intelligent look in her eye, was
indescribable.</p>
<p>She now had to learn to eat, swallow, cough up fluid, and
then walk, over next 25 days.</p>
<p>Whilst Sarah was in hospital, I was learning a lot about
patient care, drugs and how woefully unprepared I had been about cardiac
arrests and heart attacks. </p>
<p>Due to the horror of dealing with what happened to Sarah, we
are committed to making this dream a reality, because in the years ahead, I
would hate to see this level of cardiac arrest death, trauma and subsequent
human misery for other people in the world, when there is the technological means
to alleviated his human tragedy.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431156938/fj0tbjyatrwujudvhhcv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div><br/></div><h1 style=""text-align: center;""></h1><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431234775/gluskwhil9edrx62yqaf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What I learned really shocked me.</span><br/></p>
<p>Cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), (Out of
Hospital), is the number one biggest killer in the world at around 6 to 7 million deaths p.a. Bigger than malaria
which is around 3 million p.a.
Total heart disease related deaths (stroke and heart attacks etc) account for a
staggering 26 million people
p.a.!!! 1000 people per
day die from SCA in the USA, and 30 000 people p.a. in Australia. It is estimated to cost $380
Billion p.a. within
the hospital system in the USA?!</p>
<p>So, I started to try and work out a solution as to how to
approach this problem. My first approach was to consider employing first
responders on much lower cost scooters equipped with AED’s, special bike helmets with voice GPS
all under the existing paramedic services infrastructure umbrella.</p>
<p>The idea being that these responders would be volunteers,
with a minimum of training (that is, knowing CPR and how to use the AED’s), and
located in suburbia in far greater numbers than centrally located Ambulance
services, only responding to cardiac emergencies, and aiming to get there in
under 5 minutes.</p>
<p>To my mind, the scooter concept was a great idea, which I
reluctantly had to let go. Sarah, initially said it was a great idea (for
encouragement purposes I suspect), but kept pointing out the ‘bleeding’ obvious
– the logistics of achieving this in Sydney, let alone around the world, would be nigh on impossible!</p>
<p>I read up on Samaritan Sam in London, essentially an APP
illustrating where the nearest AED’s were, and although they had tremendous
life saving results in a large densely populated city, this couldn't be
effective in regional sparsely populated communities.</p>
<p>Airlines have achieved a 70% survival rate with many AED’s
in close proximity, and Las Vegas Casinos at 80%. Seattle, in the USA achieves
around 56% survival rate, as it is mandatory for every vehicle license holder
to be certified in CPR. (Interestingly, I saw a map of Singapore University
where they had placed literally hundreds of AED’s all over campus. This must
have cost over a $1M and demonstrates their understanding of the life saving value
in AED’s!)</p>
<p>So the take away from this is that readily accessible AED’s,
and early CPR intervention, achieves a greater than 50% survival rate from a
world wide current average survival rate of 1%, USA at around average 5%, and
Australia around average 3%.</p>
<p>Begrudgingly, I looked more closely at the AED, to see why
it was so expensive, and thus not widely available.</p>
<p>Through my various readings and research, it was suggested
that expense was due to the very large battery necessary to retain charge for
up to 4 years, high quality assurance to ensure functionality when it was

</div></div>","On August 9th 2014, around 7 pm, Sarah, my life
partner, best friend, confidante and wife, had a heart attack (her main heart arteries
suddenly blocked), which then induced a cardiac arrest (her heart stopped!)
from ventricular fibrillation (that is, the heart’s electrical signals
stopped).
At the time, we were lying in bed, watching TV at the foot
of the bed, and both pottering (I should have been studying for an Operations
Management exam) and reading on our iPads. I was debating with myself about
whether to go downstairs and clean up the garage versus continuing to ’bludge’
in bed.
I then heard her make a clucking sound, like our chickens in
Fiji used to do, so didn't take notice straight away, as I thought she was
‘bunging’ it on at first, to be humorous.
Then her head fell to the side with her tongue slightly
hanging outside her mouth, almost like you see when kids fake being shot and
dying.
I then started to panic, and ran around the bed to try and
understand what was going on – as Sarah has type 1 diabetes, I at first thought
maybe it was hypoglycaemic shock, and was frantically thinking about whether I
could find the Glucogon pen, or Epi Pen, and whether I would be able to ‘stab
it in’?
So I checked to see if she was dripping sweat, and she
wasn't, so now I knew this wasn't related to her blood sugars, as when she is typically
‘low’.
Her clucking sounds were coming every now and then, and this
later I was to discover was Sarah trying to breathe.
I now went into a complete Funk – Freeze, Flight and Fight.
First I wanted to scream and have somebody come save me – but there was no one,
as we live in a very quiet apartment block. I started blubbering like a little
girl, and ran up and down on the same spot as if trying to run away.
It should be appreciated that my understandable ‘freaking
out’ was surprising, considering my many (30+) years of managing and dealing
with sensory overload from so called risky sports of hang gliding, motorbike
racing and skydiving.
I snapped out of it when I realised I needed to put some
pants on – my family, very much later laughed at this (I wasn't known as the
naked gardner in Fiji for nothing) – but this physical, practical, unrelated to
the emergency action, made me start to react proactively.
So, I raced back around the bed to hunt for my phone, which
had fallen behind the bed earlier that afternoon, lamenting iPhone pass codes,
and called 000 emergency. (Maybe a voice override recognition emergency option
would be a good idea?)
I got straight through, and the calm reassuring emergency
responder person, began me on my way to getting Sarah from the bed to the
carpet. 
This proved challenging, as anyone who has tried to move a
prone body will know. She had part fallen between the bedside drawers and bed,
so was becoming wedged, and suspended mid air as the bedside drawer moved to
jam the bedroom door on the cat play stand against the wall – an unbelievable nightmare!
With extreme adrenaline supported effort, I managed to get
the non breathing Sarah on the floor.
So here I was blubbering like a stuck pig, phone in one hand
to ear, and beginning a lame one handed CPR on Sarah. The operator did not want
to let me put the phone down, I guess in case she lost me. But I put it down,
hit the speaker, and then began some serious two handed CPR, hoping like hell
it was in the optimum location. 
Lots of people say it should be to the beat of the BeeGees
‘Staying Alive’, but I can tell you, all I did was do it as fast as I could,
which was about 2 compresses every second. There were no dam tunes going
through my mind, BeeGees or otherwise.
I lost all sense of time, and even now couldn't tell you how
long it took me to begin CPR – in the days that followed, by visualising what I
remember doing, I estimate it was 2 minutes, but it could have been 30 seconds
or 30 minutes. I will never know!
From my phone call, to the paramedics arriving was
documented as 6 minutes – remarkable, fantastic, fortunate coincidence, as the
wonderful NSW Paramedics happened to be very close by. Usually it is around 11
minutes, but of course can be up to 30 minutes in extreme cases in traffic,
excess  demand etc.
They were followed closely by the volunteer Hatzolah
Paramedics that primarily attended cardiac arrest cases – one of only two
suburbs in Sydney which have this valuable, dedicated service, sponsored by the
generous Jewish community. 
They took over from me, a sweaty, blubbering mess.
They administered an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) shock, but as it was
now 8 or 9 minutes, they had to continue CPR for another 25 minutes, and I like
to think that my sorry traumatised condition spurred them on for longer than
they normally might have. (An AED needs to be administered within the first 5
minutes, as after this time it becomes increasingly less likely to revive
someone.)
They eventually, miraculously brought her back, and after
some time got her stable and started the Herculean task of getting her down
three flights of stairs unconscious in a stretcher.
The seven paramedics were great, constantly reassuring me,
and I didn't notice at the time, but Sarah’s mum observed them giving high
fives in the street, whilst Sarah and I were loaded up into two separate ‘ambo’s’ (ambulances).
It turns out that they had been unable to revive and save
the previous 28 cardiac arrest victims. Cardiac arrest is a ‘mongrel’ (horrible
human tragedy!) It strikes instantly, often without warning,  and is almost certainly fatal, particularly if
no early intervention, within seconds - not minutes or hours.Sarah’s miracle continued. So far, the stars had aligned, with
me coming to my senses and calling emergency services, then performing CPR (not
sure how effective it was),
emergency services answering immediately (on a Saturday night!), the paramedics
life saving rapid response, and then having world class on call, ready to go, cardiac surgeons
at St Vincents hospital – one of only two teams ready at separate Sydney hospitals available for
unscheduled cardiac surgery emergency. (A young man in his late twenties had a
cardiac arrest at the same time, and was sent to the other hospital, Royal
Prince of Wales – he died on the surgery table).
She received two stents in her primary heart artery, and
spent the next 14 days in intensive care in a coma. The attending doctors were
not sure how much brain injury she had sustained, and I was petrified that her
personality, and her ‘brain the size of a planet’ might be compromised. Many of
her friends (very much later), joked that if she lost half her brains, she
still would be smarter than most people.
When Sarah ‘woke’ up from her coma, although she had by this
stage had her ventilator tube replaced by a tracheotomy, (so she still couldn't
talk), she lit up when I walked into the ICU. (After Day four, a particular
Doctor I nicknamed Dr. Doom, continually suggested that as each day passed, we
were increasingly likely to get a zucchini back, and not our Sarah.)
I knew she was back, albeit with her side trek to hell, and the joy I felt
at her recognising me, and with an intelligent look in her eye, was
indescribable.
She now had to learn to eat, swallow, cough up fluid, and
then walk, over next 25 days.
Whilst Sarah was in hospital, I was learning a lot about
patient care, drugs and how woefully unprepared I had been about cardiac
arrests and heart attacks. 
Due to the horror of dealing with what happened to Sarah, we
are committed to making this dream a reality, because in the years ahead, I
would hate to see this level of cardiac arrest death, trauma and subsequent
human misery for other people in the world, when there is the technological means
to alleviated his human tragedy.What I learned really shocked me.
Cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), (Out of
Hospital), is the number one biggest killer in the world at around 6 to 7 million deaths p.a. Bigger than malaria
which is around 3 million p.a.
Total heart disease related deaths (stroke and heart attacks etc) account for a
staggering 26 million people
p.a.!!! 1000 people per
day die from SCA in the USA, and 30 000 people p.a. in Australia. It is estimated to cost $380
Billion p.a. within
the hospital system in the USA?!
So, I started to try and work out a solution as to how to
approach this problem. My first approach was to consider employing first
responders on much lower cost scooters equipped with AED’s, special bike helmets with voice GPS
all under the existing paramedic services infrastructure umbrella.
The idea being that these responders would be volunteers,
with a minimum of training (that is, knowing CPR and how to use the AED’s), and
located in suburbia in far greater numbers than centrally located Ambulance
services, only responding to cardiac emergencies, and aiming to get there in
under 5 minutes.
To my mind, the scooter concept was a great idea, which I
reluctantly had to let go. Sarah, initially said it was a great idea (for
encouragement purposes I suspect), but kept pointing out the ‘bleeding’ obvious
– the logistics of achieving this in Sydney, let alone around the world, would be nigh on impossible!
I read up on Samaritan Sam in London, essentially an APP
illustrating where the nearest AED’s were, and although they had tremendous
life saving results in a large densely populated city, this couldn't be
effective in regional sparsely populated communities.
Airlines have achieved a 70% survival rate with many AED’s
in close proximity, and Las Vegas Casinos at 80%. Seattle, in the USA achieves
around 56% survival rate, as it is mandatory for every vehicle license holder
to be certified in CPR. (Interestingly, I saw a map of Singapore University
where they had placed literally hundreds of AED’s all over campus. This must
have cost over a $1M and demonstrates their understanding of the life saving value
in AED’s!)
So the take away from this is that readily accessible AED’s,
and early CPR intervention, achieves a greater than 50% survival rate from a
world wide current average survival rate of 1%, USA at around average 5%, and
Australia around average 3%.
Begrudgingly, I looked more closely at the AED, to see why
it was so expensive, and thus not widely available.
Through my various readings and research, it was suggested
that expense was due to the very large battery necessary to retain charge for
up to 4 years, high quality assurance to ensure functionality when it was
needed over this time frame, and of course the relatively low volumes to
support true scales of economy.                          
These three key determinations allowed me to keep
researching ways of achieving solutions. A break through then followed, when I
realized that implantable defibrillators were so much smaller (the size of 3
large 50 cent coins stacked upon each other ~ roughly speaking), with the bulk
of their mass again donated to a 10 year battery, and the ‘voltage delivery and
sensors taking up the space of half a cigarette in size.
These devices are enormously costly, again due to smaller
volumes manufactured, very expensive due to surgically appropriate materials
(like gold for circuits), huge R & D to be amortized, and costly medical
regulatory compliance costs.
The exact realization of getting a small device such as this
implantable defibrillator into a smart phone was not a linear process, but made
perfect sense! Many discussions with Sarah and my partner in this endeavor,
Andre, allowed a true brainstorming discovery process.
With 2016 projected sales of two billion smart phones world
wide, it must be the most coveted, ubiquitous prized possession of everyone,
from young kids to the elderly.
This takes care of the volume consideration and economies of
scale that could reduce the manufacturing cost.
The technology thus exists to reduce the size of the AED, by
having the delivery of the required voltage in the size of cigarette sized
cylinder, which could then be placed in the bottom of the phone case.
The sensing components (pads) would be specially designed
fold out and expandable from the back of the case – very thin, and wires concertinaed.
The voice and visual display would be downloadable in APP
form, with speaker already in the smart phone.
No requirement for a battery, which would utilize the iPhone
(and potentially other devices like the iPad) built in battery, which is kept
small by regular over night charging.
With AED mode utilization, the battery charge would be used
completely over a 30 minute to 40 minute AED mode working period.
Lower quality standard requirements for components that remain
outside the body, and which typically, only need to last a year, two at the
most as compared with an AED.
Initially, it is felt that the phone case is the preferred
location of the AED, as once it is used, a new one would be required. If it
were placed in the iPhone itself, costs may go up, and servicing cost would be enormous.
Discussions with Smart phone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung are planned
however in the future.
The power of this idea, is that the affordability, and thus availability
by virtually everyone, if the cost of the CELLAED is around the same cost of a current phone case!

(And with the planned, simply beautiful, futuristic range of
materials and designs of phone cases to come, it will be easy to see universal
adoption.)
To ensure this affordability and widespread use, we have
structured this enterprise as a Not for
Profit Association – so profits are retained to continue the development of
this social enterprise, and not be distributed to a few share holders, thereby
benefiting everyone in the world.
With a successful future global business, we are aiming to

treatments to this horrific malady. We will also look at methods for ensuring the
rest of humanity has the option to access this life saving technology by

Losing Sarah would have been unimaginable for me, so too is the
loss of millions of other lives, and the misery attached seems unacceptable to

In simple terms, the CELLAED
works as follows:
The CELLAED will
go into AED mode as soon as the two pads are pulled out from the back of the
phone case – immediately then the relevant country emergency service is
subsequently dialed. 
As the pads are placed on the victim, the emergency operator
is obtaining location details (although they may have this information from the
location APP already).
The CELLAED then
advises both on the screen and in loud audio to either keep hands free as a
shock is administered, or it advises to commence CPR and can advise how to do
this.
The AED assistance is found to be calming and provides for a
heuristic response, thereby alleviating some of the responder trauma anxiety.
The CELLAED will enhance these
characteristics through superior audio and visual cues.

Our smartphones are crucial to our everyday lives. We use them for near enough everything, so why are all the options to charge them so bulky or awkward to use?


At Zuo Charge we're always trying to invent ways to overcome the biggest problem we have with our smartphones, keeping them charged up.

S2 allows you to charge any device or accessory using a Micro-USB OTG device anywhere.
    


The cable acts like a USB so you can move pictures, videos, music etc between devices.



Make sure you never lose your cable by attaching it to virtually anything.


Instead of forgetting your cable at home, you can take it with you on your keys.



The small bendy cable helps prevent damage to the wires inside during use and while it's on your keys.

<p>On May 31, 2011, World Health Organization and International Agency For Research On Cancer classified radiation of
cell phones as a suspected carcinogen and identified it into 2B group of
“suspected carcinogen for man” agents.</p>
<p>As far as a phone transmits electromagnetic radiation and is close to a man’s body, there is danger of
that radiation harm to health. This radiation can cause local rise of the
living tissue temperature and according
to statements of some scientists, it can cause appearance of chromosome
aberration in cells. Cancer (encephaloma) is considered as the main possible
effect of radio-frequency fields’ long-term influence. Also there is danger of
potency problems emergence because of phone carrying near genitalia.</p>
<p>Harm adherents often express version that financial interest of phone
manufacturers is the cause of their hiding or “glossing over” the results of
researching on the subject.</p>
<p>We know about electromagnetic radiation of the phone for 13-15 years.
And till now we can’t say exactly how this radiation influences on a human
being, because this is a long-term perspective. I want to notice that the same
thing happened with smoking, people didn’t know where it’d led to for a long
time. And only 10 years ago smoking hazards were proved by science.</p>

<p><strong>France</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>Legislative body of the country has approved legislative draft according
to which pupils of junior and middle classes cannot carry and use phones within
the walls of educational establishments.</p>
<p>The cause of such decision is children protection from electromagnetic
radiation. Besides, Senate has raised children age from 12 to 14 years old to
whom phone manufacturers can apply with advertisement.</p>
<p><strong>Great Britain:</strong></p>
<p>Using of cell phones in schools was forbidden in the country in 2001;
during their sale informative brochures are being put into the box concerning
possible consequences of communications by cell phones.</p>
<p><strong>Bangladesh:</strong></p>
<p>Parents bear criminal responsibility for giving to use cell phones to their
children.</p>
<p><strong>Apple:</strong></p>
<p>It is written in Iphone manual that one must carry the phone in 10 mm

Thanks to its fineness it will easily be placed in your case together with your phone.IN TNE PRESS!
           


On May 31, 2011, World Health Organization and International Agency For Research On Cancer classified radiation of
cell phones as a suspected carcinogen and identified it into 2B group of
“suspected carcinogen for man” agents.
As far as a phone transmits electromagnetic radiation and is close to a man’s body, there is danger of
that radiation harm to health. This radiation can cause local rise of the
living tissue temperature and according
to statements of some scientists, it can cause appearance of chromosome
aberration in cells. Cancer (encephaloma) is considered as the main possible
effect of radio-frequency fields’ long-term influence. Also there is danger of
potency problems emergence because of phone carrying near genitalia.
Harm adherents often express version that financial interest of phone
manufacturers is the cause of their hiding or “glossing over” the results of
researching on the subject.
We know about electromagnetic radiation of the phone for 13-15 years.
And till now we can’t say exactly how this radiation influences on a human
being, because this is a long-term perspective. I want to notice that the same
thing happened with smoking, people didn’t know where it’d led to for a long
time. And only 10 years ago smoking hazards were proved by science.

France:
Legislative body of the country has approved legislative draft according
to which pupils of junior and middle classes cannot carry and use phones within
the walls of educational establishments.
The cause of such decision is children protection from electromagnetic
radiation. Besides, Senate has raised children age from 12 to 14 years old to
whom phone manufacturers can apply with advertisement.
Great Britain:
Using of cell phones in schools was forbidden in the country in 2001;
during their sale informative brochures are being put into the box concerning
possible consequences of communications by cell phones.
Bangladesh:
Parents bear criminal responsibility for giving to use cell phones to their
children.
Apple:
It is written in Iphone manual that one must carry the phone in 10 mm
away from the body.
The insert absorbs electromagnetic radiation due to Z-type exoferrite;
as it is a powder silicone serves as a binding agent. The technology as well as
composing substances are patented by TSU. This insert reduces radiation from
phone and makes it harmless for everyday usage. The insert use does not
influence on signal strength. The technology is patented and certificated. Our
insert absorbs about 50-60% of electromagnetic radiation, and that is not a
marketing. Unlike the competition who sell incomprehensible things and indicate
that their cases and insert absorb 90-99% of electromagnetic radiation. That is
an absolute lie, because with such insert phone operation in the network area
is impossible. Our insert does not remove electromagnetic radiation completely,
but reduces its power making it harmless for human body. If the insert removed
electromagnetic radiation for 90-99% the phone wouldn’t tune the network.Additionally a phone with reducing electromagnetic radiation insert
resists external wiretapping.

  We don’t offer you cases
with built-in insert, because we understand that every person wants to be
personalized. And so we have decided that it would be much more practical and
convenient to place the insert in the inner of your favourite case than to buy
a new one.

We believe that if our customer's can't contact us at anytime of the day, no matter what the circumstances are; then we have failed. No matter what time it is, or what day it might be, we are dedicated to serving our customers no matter what. Questions, comments or concerns? Contact our support team that is available 24/7, all year round. Additionally for customers who have spent $200+ at Boltivate, we offer Dedicated Support; this is a department with fewer calls, and shorter wait times. Dedicated Support is a ""Fast-Pass"" to speak with an agent, or get any issue resolved almost immediately. Dedicated Customers also have the option to renew warranty plans, and add a plan to an exiting Boltivate.How You Can HelpIf I cant contribute, but still want to help, what can I do? Share our Website - www.Boltivate.com Like us on Facebook - Click Here Follow us on Twitter - Click HereI grew up in Saddle River, New Jersey. Ever since I was 11 years old, I have developed an extreme passion for technology and programming. At 11 years old, I taught myself (With the help of YouTube) how to program and code. Since then the skills have stuck with me and I use them almost every day. I founded Boltivate Technologies back in 2014, and I am now ready to take this company to the next level. I have always been fascinated by technology - and the smart lock was definitely a challenge, but not one I couldn't conquer. Now, at 14 years old, I am the proud inventor and CEO of Boltivate.www.Boltivate.com   Call us toll free: 1-800-202-7366 Email us: support@boltivate.com or Like us on Facebook - Click Here Follow us on Twitter - Click HereRisks and challengesWe work extremely hard to get to this point and intend to do everything within our power to deliver Boltivate to you as seamless as possible. The following are risks and challenges that could occur: MANUFACTURING: There is a 10 week delay from the end of the campaign until Boltivate will ship to your doorstep. This time is dedicated for testing, production, and configuration. All of it is for your security, and benefit. PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: In the case we would like to alter Boltivate and create any adjustments, it will only delay the launch by an expected 1 week. You will be notified if this happens, but we are trying to make any adjustments before the campaign is over so we do not create a delay.FULFILLMENT: If the funding goal is reached, we will do all we possibly can to fulfill.",33.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Kepler is a social networking site which aims to serve as a platform for online activism and the propagation of social initiatives. </p>
<p>Users can follow specialized pages of charities , NGO's and social enterprises which tackle issues most relevant to them . This would thus allow the concentration of communication when using an app of an NGO/Charity to be replicated on a wider and common platform.</p>
<p>Users can also create and/or follow campaign,activist pages ,blogs,pledges,and petitions for campaigning and activism at an individual level , taking on issues most which matter most to them in society . An activist on the platform may also choose to organise a rally/campaign to support his/her campaign in real life .  </p>

<h3>The Impact  </h3>
<p></p>
<p>Prior to the creation of Kepler , I , the founder , was very involved in issues such as the Syrian civil war and climate change and would look for various ways to help and raise awareness. However , as time passed , it slowly dawned on me that some issues cannot be solved by an individual , rather they require the collective 'power of the people'. This served as the motivation and base for creating the social network . </p>
<p>Funding and backing this campaign would mean taking the proactive steps into the creation of the platform. This would allow people form across the world ,  to come together to solve and tackle issues and problems in society ; in both a local and a  global scale.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Rewards ( k-points)</h3>
<div>For individual users </div>
<div>Kepler points or K-points are reward points issued out based on the usage of the platform. These points once accumulated can be redeemed from Charities , NGO'S and Social enterprises . Forms of  potential redeems could be the example of a charity organisation offering a free volunteer trip for 1000 k-points or a social enterprise offering a coupon for 100 k-points. </div>

Find yourself sitting around cafes, hotel lobbies and airport lounges, waiting for your SLOW power banks to charge? Some of us try to overcome this by buying larger capacity, BULKY & UGLY power banks. To make matters worse, many power banks in the market are UNSAFE and are prone to accidents.That is why the team behind IRISx came up with the world's fastest charging power bank, which is slim & sexy at the same time.The magic behind IRISxInstead of using lithium-ion batteries to store power, IRISx is equipped with high-density Graphene polymer batteries, which allows the 10,000mah battery to charge in just 30 minutes.                       Goodbye to mediocre power banks.A typical lithium ion power bank: 
requires 5-6 hours of charging (10,000mah),
has short battery life (300-500 charges),
is bulky and ugly, 

and may be prone to short circuits and explosions.       

IRISx is better, in every way.    Perfect for emergencies.If you ever find yourself in a situation, when both your mobile phone and power banks have ran out of juice...(I'm sure we all have =)All you need is 7mins and 30 seconds of charging on IRISx, to fully charge your mobile phone. You could do this over a coffee break.

Grab yours now to enjoy early bird discounts!Our Production As of today, we have completed the necessary stress tests and safety certifications. We have moved into the production stage, and are preparing to fulfil sample orders from various retailers around the world.Grab your Early Bird discounts now!FAQ  When will IRISx be shipped? When will I receive the item? //We will ship out IRISx between 1 to 2 weeks after the campaign ends. Depending on your location, you will receive the item between 3 to 20 days after. Is there warranty for IRISx? //Yes, there is a 1 year warranty against manufacturing defects and loss in battery capacity.

He is a designer by trade, running his own branding agency.

<p>    This is true, that to create something really great is extremely difficult. However, you need to start with something. <strong>Such a beginning for us was the first version of Bordo mini in 2015.</strong> It was a very simple, but at the same time, quite a good wallet, which many liked.</p>
<p>    <strong>We successfully delivered all the rewards and with new forces rushed into improvements and perfections.</strong> That way the second version was born. This project also became successful, but our product didn’t receive great popularity. But I had anticipation ... A feeling, that it was just the beginning. This is not just “another wallet”. <strong>This is probably the best wallet in the world, it just needs to be improved a little more.</strong> And we got to work again...</p>
<p><strong>    As a result, in 2017 a new wallet was born, which received great support. </strong>It was amazing! Honestly, we even stopped the advertising campaign after the first two weeks. Why? We were just afraid not to cope. In contrast to our past project, when we had only 130 backers, there were more than 100 in the new one only for the first day!<strong> But despite all the difficulties, we coped with this and delivered the best wallets to each of our backers.</strong> Then we organized sales through our website. Our business was going not bad :) But we can’t live in peace. What do you think we did? We again started to improve and refine our favorite wallet.</p>
<p>   <strong> To tell the truth, the creation of this project was not very easy for us. </strong>In total, we spent almost a year on all the works. The tasks that we faced were more difficult than we thought, and some seemingly trivial things were very difficult to accomplish. What motivated us all this time?<strong> It's you! The person, who writes that can’t wait for our wallet.</strong> The one, who says that his son has taken away his own wallet because it is so cool and he wants to order another one. <strong>All your feedback is a huge charge of motivation and energy for us.</strong></p>

<p>    Bordo mini is developed <strong>in two designs</strong>, which differ not only in materials, but also in structural elements. Let's learn more about each of them.  </p>
<p> <strong>   Leather design. </strong>The wallet is made of genuine high-quality Italian leather with a thickness of 1.4 - 1.6 mm. It is made in four calm colors: black, gray, brown, beige. It will perfectly supplement your outfit and can be combined with other leather products of your wardrobe. A sophisticated appearance will allow to take it even for a very official and solemn event.</p>

</div><p> </p><p>  <strong>  Fabric design.</strong> The wallet is made of dense wear-resistant fabric with a polyurethane water-repellent finish. It is ideal for outstanding outfits, or vice versa - in a strict style it will create a bright highlight. This wallet attracts attention, it will be a key element of your image.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567431098/mi7wj9vg9nza3xbgeflv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>    <strong>Manufacturing BORDO mini consists of many processes and stages.</strong> Some of them, of course, we try to replace by machine work, only if it is appropriate. But still, how many moments are done by the master! <strong>Furthermore, the most important thing in BORDO mini are the best materials and accessories. No need to say that a good impression of a nice design can be easily spoiled by cheap materials. </strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567431496/wymwoehm3pjfeaxwxcku.png"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>    <strong>Genuine Italian leather (leather design).</strong> All the time of our existence we work with this material. And during this time it didn’t let us down once. This is really beautiful and at the same time very practical material.</p><p>    <strong>High quality fabric (fabric design).</strong> Dense fabric with a water-repellent finish. You don’t need to worry about its durability, because it is mainly used for the tailoring of special working clothes in high-intensity labor conditions.</p><p>    <strong>Felt (fabric design). </strong>A semi-natural material that is used in BORDO mini to give it density and desired shape. We tried a lot of materials on this role, but felt coped best.</p><p>    <strong>RFID protection. </strong>This is something that must be in every wallet. With BORDO mini you can be confident in the safety of your personal data. The entire wallet, except for the extra card slot or coin slot, is RFID protected!</p><p>    <strong>High-quality fabric with a pattern of «tartan».</strong> Well, this is the brand element of BORDO mini.</p><p>  <strong>  High-quality fittings.</strong> We experimented a lot with the world brands of fittings, but now we stopped at the zipper from the company YKK and buttons of Prime. After all, this is one of the most important parts of Bordo mini, which will provide a long period of use of the wallet!</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.gifer.com/3NwEx.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567431732/a2e1uyqoscrxtrsfe7mv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567431775/ywqxlobpksczzijy74gr.png"" src=""""/></p><p>    <strong>Tastes differ.</strong> We don’t know your preferences, so we give you the complete freedom for creating something perfect for you!

    Leather design. The wallet is made of genuine high-quality Italian leather with a thickness of 1.4 - 1.6 mm. It is made in four calm colors: black, gray, brown, beige. It will perfectly supplement your outfit and can be combined with other leather products of your wardrobe. A sophisticated appearance will allow to take it even for a very official and solemn event.

     Fabric design. The wallet is made of dense wear-resistant fabric with a polyurethane water-repellent finish. It is ideal for outstanding outfits, or vice versa - in a strict style it will create a bright highlight. This wallet attracts attention, it will be a key element of your image.    Manufacturing BORDO mini consists of many processes and stages. Some of them, of course, we try to replace by machine work, only if it is appropriate. But still, how many moments are done by the master! Furthermore, the most important thing in BORDO mini are the best materials and accessories. No need to say that a good impression of a nice design can be easily spoiled by cheap materials.     Genuine Italian leather (leather design). All the time of our existence we work with this material. And during this time it didn’t let us down once. This is really beautiful and at the same time very practical material.    High quality fabric (fabric design). Dense fabric with a water-repellent finish. You don’t need to worry about its durability, because it is mainly used for the tailoring of special working clothes in high-intensity labor conditions.    Felt (fabric design). A semi-natural material that is used in BORDO mini to give it density and desired shape. We tried a lot of materials on this role, but felt coped best.    RFID protection. This is something that must be in every wallet. With BORDO mini you can be confident in the safety of your personal data. The entire wallet, except for the extra card slot or coin slot, is RFID protected!    High-quality fabric with a pattern of «tartan». Well, this is the brand element of BORDO mini.    High-quality fittings. We experimented a lot with the world brands of fittings, but now we stopped at the zipper from the company YKK and buttons of Prime. After all, this is one of the most important parts of Bordo mini, which will provide a long period of use of the wallet!     Tastes differ. We don’t know your preferences, so we give you the complete freedom for creating something perfect for you! You can choose between fabric and leather design, which have their own colors. Your wallet can be opened to the right or left. Moreover, there is a choice of an additional slot: a card slot or a slot for coins. All this you can choose in the survey after the completion of the project!      We are a small but purposeful team of like-minded people from Ukraine, who work every day, creating without modesty the best wallet in the world. Now is our time. We have a lot of experience, successful projects behind us and thousands of satisfied customers around the world. And I think our journey is just beginning! We need a little more of your support!    Join now! The most interesting is yet to come!   To tell the truth, the creation of this project was not very easy for us. In total, we spent almost a year on all the works. The tasks that we faced were more difficult than we thought, and some seemingly trivial things were very difficult to accomplish. What motivated us all this time? It's you! The person, who writes that can’t wait for our wallet. The one, who says that his son has taken away his own wallet because it is so cool and he wants to order another one. All your feedback is a huge charge of motivation and energy for us!",36.0,2,"1 Campaign

He and his colleagues needed their electronic devices charged all day; however, were unable to do so despite having their chargers with them. The crux of the problem was finding sockets to connect the adapters. To add on, even if the socket was available, either there were too many devices for one socket or the socket was inconveniently placed. This observation planted an idea in his mind about the need of a stand alone charging device that people can </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">conveniently</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> carry with them.

</div></div>","Our Journey
It all started started in 2011 when Rohan (CEO - Elixier Tech) was finishing his MBA from IE Business School, Spain. He and his colleagues needed their electronic devices charged all day; however, were unable to do so despite having their chargers with them. The crux of the problem was finding sockets to connect the adapters. To add on, even if the socket was available, either there were too many devices for one socket or the socket was inconveniently placed. This observation planted an idea in his mind about the need of a stand alone charging device that people can conveniently carry with them. This simple idea evolved into a business plan when Rohan came back to India in 2013 and shared the concept with us (Co-founders of Elixier Tech). 
Since the inception in 2013, we have realized that apart from the problem mentioned above and irrespective of the geography and culture, there are some common issues faced by most of the urban dwellers in their day to day lives.



So what are these issues..?


How we developed a Solution:
We at Elixier Tech Innovatis LLP. want to make a difference in the lives of the people as well as the environment. We have managed to contain the extensive power of the sun in a device so compact that it
practically fits in your pocket. Hence, after almost 18 months of hard-work and dedication, team ET has finally developed the 'ET-Stone™'.
ET-Stone™ is a seamless integration of state of the art technology and 
revolutionary design, making it by far the smartest solar power bank 
ever made. The super efficient & powerful lamp and torch ensure that
 you never face dark situations again. It 
is capable of charging almost every device that can be charged through a
 USB cable and providing hours of high intensity light output. The product is designed with only one aim - To optimise user experience.


We want to ensure that people stay connected irrespective of the location and circumstances so without
any inhibitions one can EXPLORE different
possibilities, ENDURE new
experiences & EVOLVE into a
greener and sustainable generation.
Basically, our product not only offers break-through technology, but also guarantees mobility, easy accessibility and independence. Solar charging gives you the freedom to travel hassle free without any ""wires"" attached.


We believe that, our product will not only create an 
awareness of the use of green energy amongst the masses but also 
revolutionize the way people charge their electronic devices.

(*Detailed explanations given below in 'Features')



Features (in brief)






Main Features

1. Solar Charging




Charging Time
The portable solar
products available in the market are equipped with obsolete technology which
leads to higher charging time (4-5 days for approx. 2000mAh battery) thus
making the usage impractical and boring.

Our company is focused
on changing this stereotype by providing a product with ground breaking
technology which enables a user to charge the product in less than 14 hours.
Low Light Charging
ET–Stone™ not only
charges under strong sunlight but also charges in ambient (low light) / cloudy
atmosphere thus ensuring that the product charges in all weather conditions.
No need to look at the
weather forecast EVER





The Super Efficient Solar Panel
We have used a super efficient Solar Panel made from Sun Power Cells, thus differentiating ET–Stone™ from the other
portable solar power banks available in the market. Believe it or not, the cost
price of our solar panel is almost equivalent to the cost of regular power
banks thus giving you an idea regarding the quality of the components used in
ET–Stone™






2. Revolutionary 3D Design & Kickstand

For us, every minute
detail matters. ET-Stone™ sports a never seen before ergonomic design that symbolizes a combination of rigidity, smoothness and strength which are the
inherent properties of a stone. We wanted our customers to experience
technology in the most natural form.
The revolutionary
kickstand developed and patented by us, has been made after months of research, keeping in mind usability, convenience and durability as the main aspects to
redefine user experience. It also provides protection to the main body thus facilitating additional rigidity.
The kickstand allows the
user to rotate the product a full 360⁰ which facilitates:



Solar charging depending upon the angle of the sunlight


Light output in each and every angle


Hanging the product whenever needed


The kickstand boasts
two ¼” 20 UNC brass thread inserts giving the user an option to attach the
product to a car mount (provided with the product), tripod, gorilla kickstand
etc.



3. Fits in your pocket


One of the main challenges we faced was to compress this cutting edge technology into something that fits in your pocket. Portability is the key today and we ensured that ET-Stone™ perfectly blends with your daily routine.

4. Wall-mount (Adapter) Charging

ET-Stone™ can be charged through any wall
adapter in addition to Solar charging.


5. Laptop / Desktop Charging


Dual Charging is one of the most unique features of ET-Stone™. It means that, if your product battery is low and so is your device (eg. mobile) battery and you have only one adapter or PC / laptop connection, you will no longer have to choose between charging of your device and charging of ET-Stone™.
Your mobile will start charging first and once it's sufficiently charged, the charging will shift to ET-Stone™. This feature is feasible with adapter & PC / laptop connection.
An ideal situation for overnight charging.



6. Dual Charging



Dual Charging is one of the most unique features of ET-Stone™. It means
that, if your product battery is low and so is your device (eg. mobile) battery and you have only one adapter or PC/Laptop connection, you will no longer have to choose between charging of your device and charging of ET-Stone™. 
How it works:
1. Connect any wall-mount adapter to ET-Stone™
2. Connect USB Cable from ET-Stone™ to your device
3. Switch on the wall-mount adapter and charging button on ET-Stone™



(*Disclaimer: This feature is not applicable during solar charging of the product ) 

7. Smart Charging 



ET–Stone™ smartly detects which device it is charging and accordingly provides output current and avoids forcible charging at higher currents (which is done by most of the power-banks in the market) so as to increase the battery life of the device. This does not mean that the product will charge the device slowly, it can charge devices up to 1.5A. 

It's Smart Algorithm manages all the functions using a high performance  microprocessor
ET-Stone™ has a provision for Low light Charging
During solar charging, the power bank provides safety against current spiking and excess sun
Pre-Charge - Fast Charge - Natural Charge - Charge Termination – It follows this process and simultaneously protects your power bank battery & increases battery life
Constantly boosts product battery voltage at 5V thus giving extremely stable output to your device

ET-Stone™ is compatible with a wide range of adapters. It smartly senses between PC/Laptop & Wallmount adapter and accordingly adjusts the current





8. Lamp & Torch


The next most important feature of ET-Stone™ is the highly efficient lamp & torch. The Lamp, which can be seen on the front face of the product comprises of 2 powerful led’s whereas the Torch, which is placed at the bottom side comprises of a single led. To enhance and to provide a wide angle dispersion of the light output, we have used customized anti – glare lenses.
There are 3 intensities of light for the lamp which can
be adjusted by the user according to his/her requirements, enabling longer hours
of light. It gives..
a)  14 hours of light at the 1st intensity
b)  22 hours of light at the 2nd  intensity
c)  35 hours of light at the 3rd  intensity
The torch has a single intensity.


9. Emergencies


ET-Stone™ has an inbuilt SOS Light feature which can be activated by
a 2 second long press of the lamp button. This feature is extremely helpful in
emergency situations such as car breakdowns, camping and hiking incidences where
you want to signal for help or any other dire conditions where signalling becomes
a lifesaving option.




Applications 



Apart from being an ideal device for daily use, ET-Stone™ is also, an extremely handy device in the following scenarios:



Your perfect travel companion


ET-Stone™ gives you the freedom to roam and travel by actually staying completely unplugged. No more worrying about carrying additional chargers and wires and no more hunting for charging sockets. ET-Stone™ is compatible with almost all devices that can be charged by a USB cable. The solar charging feature ensures that you can visit the most remote or exotic locations without having to be concerned about staying connected. If you are a camping or a hiking junkie, our extremely efficient & powerful in-built lamp can become your ideal partner for those adventurous nights.
We all know that mobiles and tablets have become extremely critical for the smooth functioning of any business today. People now check their emails, presentations, project reports etc. on these portable devices. Keeping these devices charged on the go has become a persistent issue. Our 3100 mAh battery ensures that this issue is minimized and business travellers can conveniently focus on their business and nothing else.


Disaster Management

During any
natural disaster such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes etc., the two major
issues that surface out are connectivity and power outages. People are stranded
for days together without any access to light thus making them completely
helpless. Also, having mobile phones without any charge, keeps the people
disconnected from the rest of the world. This is a genuine problem faced by any
disaster struck area. At such times, a powerful tool like ET-Stone™ can prove to
be extremely handy.
ET-Stone™ being a standalone solar device, can provide essential ‘mobile
charge’ to make those emergency phone calls and almost ‘35 hours of powerful
light’ to help you survive the night, without having to rely on any other source
of electricity.
ET-Stone™ can
become an ideal addition to your personal Disaster Management Kit. It can
also be of tremendous help to those brave rescuers who provide help to the
stranded victims in difficult times.











Rural Impact




Access to electricity is a serious issue faced by majority of the rural
population all over the world. Efforts are being made to change this status-quo
but the problem still remains persistent. People living in those environments
are majorly dependent on kerosene lamps which though providing them with basic
light are indirectly affecting their health and making them vulnerable to burns
and explosions.
Emissions from the use of Kerosene lamps may
impair lung function and stimulate infectious illnesses such as tuberculosis,
asthma, and cancer risks in the long run. Apart from the health risks, there is
a permanent safety issue with using these kerosene lamps as they have been a cause
of many fatal accidents till date.
Some practical problems that these people face
include children trying to study and women trying to perform their day-to-day
chores in light which is hardly sufficient to cater to their basic needs.
Another relevant issue faced by the rural areas
is the distribution of mediocre
products which hardly last for a few months, thus forcing the population to
turn back to the use of kerosene lamps.
Our aim is to replace these harmful kerosene lamps
with an efficient, safe and technologically advanced product so as to give
those people a chance to live a safer and a healthier life.
Since cost is a major constraint for
the rural populace, we have designed an alternative product called the ET-BRICK™, which will boast the same technology as the ET-Stone™ but with minor changes
in some of the features and a simpler design to make it easily affordable to them. 



(*Disclaimer: Technical Details of
ET-Brick will be disclosed shortly)





ET Flash Cable (The Whip)







A great product
deserves a great accessory. We have also come up with
a customized USB A to Micro USB cable capable of charging the
product and your electronic device at a faster rate as
compared to the other cables available in the market. The Whip is a carefully designed accessory that not only helps in charging electronic devices
but also assists in data transfer. All in all, it is a perfect extension of ET-Stone™.



Flexi Car Mount (FCM)





The Flexi Car Mount (FCM) takes the usability factor of ET-Stone™ to the next level. You can affix the FCM to the windshield or any window of your car (using the suction cup) and pair it with ET-Stone™ using the threads given on the kickstand. The flexible FCM allows you to move the solar power bank in various angles with the help of its 2 axis swivel mechanism. The FCM gives you a cool opportunity to start using the solar charging function of ET-Stone™ while you are 'on the go'. 


The FCM, paired with ET-Stone™ can also be used in your home or any other indoor place (by attaching it to a window or a mirror) to either give light output or to achieve solar charging.

Timeline




Risks & Challenges
We have been working for over a year for developing ET-Stone™
and getting it ready for production. The manufacturing aspect is completely
sorted and our vendors are established. We are almost ready with the molds and
are currently in the process of acquiring necessary certifications for the
product. ET-Stone™ comprises of components coming from countries such as USA,
Italy, Korea and China which means that the only possible risk we may encounter
is the uncertainty / delay in shipping of these components to our manufacturing
site in Goa (India). We have ensured that this risk is mitigated by tieing up
with reputed
vendors and by following a well-established
procurement process.



Other ways you can help us..

He was struck with a major business deal and disconnecting this call could have a huge negative impact with a major client. His client could probably feel he might not be interested with the deal. He was struck, So was our entire group. Everyone was helpless just staring each other on what to do .None of us had his clients number so that he could callback using any of our phones. <br/><br/>We somehow wanted to bring back his phone alive so that we could continue the trek. But we weren't that lucky because all our power banks were at home and there was no charging point's across miles , All we were left was a bunch of friends &amp; their phones . Finally,  We had to cancel the trek and return back in a hurry.<br/><br/>We at <a href=""www.waferlabs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WaferLabs </a>, a startup based in Bangalore, India realized that there is a critical need to make emergency charging simple .  Our phone can run out dead any time as we usually don't keep a track on the battery stats . Once our phone is switched off , Our contacts / messages / notes , everything will be shut down. Imagine a person goes for an interview in some new city but once he reaches, his phone dies out of charge .  The contact details of the interviewer were on his phone . Now where should he go ? How would he find the place? Whom he shall scream for help?  the time is running really fast with pressure struck tightly in his mind !<br/><br/>We had seen lots of examples like this and we really wanted to bring out some solution. We held up our self with a commitment to make emergency charging even simpler. We worked ,worked and worked .

"" It was  an unplanned trekking with my best buddies.The place was great to enjoy but everything went in vain when one of my friend's phone was switched off just before he could complete an important business call . He was struck with a major business deal and disconnecting this call could have a huge negative impact with a major client. His client could probably feel he might not be interested with the deal. He was struck, So was our entire group. Everyone was helpless just staring each other on what to do .None of us had his clients number so that he could callback using any of our phones. We somehow wanted to bring back his phone alive so that we could continue the trek. But we weren't that lucky because all our power banks were at home and there was no charging point's across miles , All we were left was a bunch of friends & their phones . Finally,  We had to cancel the trek and return back in a hurry.We at WaferLabs , a startup based in Bangalore, India realized that there is a critical need to make emergency charging simple .  Our phone can run out dead any time as we usually don't keep a track on the battery stats . Once our phone is switched off , Our contacts / messages / notes , everything will be shut down. Imagine a person goes for an interview in some new city but once he reaches, his phone dies out of charge .  The contact details of the interviewer were on his phone . Now where should he go ? How would he find the place? Whom he shall scream for help?  the time is running really fast with pressure struck tightly in his mind !We had seen lots of examples like this and we really wanted to bring out some solution. We held up our self with a commitment to make emergency charging even simpler. We worked ,worked and worked . Finally were successful  in coming up with a fully working prototype of a gadget that allows phone to phone charge sharing.  We thus invented HDkey - The worlds first phone to Phone Charger "" -  Ameen ,  Co-founder waferlabs HDkey - As Featured on  : Re/Code , Economic Times , NextBigWhat, E27 , Lifehacker , Gizmodo , TechEntice , Venture Capital News , Dependent on Gadgets , Eenadu , TechBuzz , CrowdVita , SocialScientist , AndroidDaily , and More

Hi guys, This is Ameen from WaferLabs - A startup by experienced engineers with strong passion to deliver the best out of technology for the people across the globe. After experiencing frustration with the battery life of our

The inspiration comes from a day when me and my friends were on a trekking , and one of my friend's phone was switched off just before he had to attend an urgent business call . There was no power sources , No power banks around us , All we had was just a bunch of friends with mobile phones, Everyone helpless !


We decided to do something: create the world's most compact device which can allow hassle free phone to phone charging , high speed data transfer and automation using NFC , to be always carried along.

<h3>But isn't democracy already accessible to everyone?</h3>
<p>Right now, our election system is messy and discriminatory.</p>
<p>Imagine voting as a new citizen. It might take years after coming to the United States in order to become eligible to vote. On election day, you make it to your polling place and make it through the line – only to receive an English-language ballot that you can’t figure out. You don’t know exactly what you’re voting for, or how to correctly fill it in. Poll workers give you the cold shoulder because they can’t really understand you, either.</p>
<p>Frustrated and intimidated, you give up your political voice.</p>
<p>Even if you’re fluent in English, struggling with bureaucracy is real. Add the layer of a language barrier, and it becomes nearly impossible. Voting is particularly difficult, and since Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters speak so many different languages and dialects, they are at special risk of being excluded.</p>

<p>We know that people with limited English proficiency are just as smart or smarter than people who are fluent in English – some may be our family elders. And AAPI voters want to vote, but they face barriers at every step. According to a 2012 exit poll from the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, nearly 1 in 4 Asian Americans prefer to vote with help from an interpreter or translated materials. And while the Voting Rights Act mandates translated voting ballots and materials, it’s only sometimes enforced, and only applies to districts with a “significant” number of citizens, determined by the Census. Meanwhile, the last Census is already 5 years out of date, and AAPIs are the fastest-growing racial demographic. The American Community Survey estimates the number of AAPIs who speak English less than fluently at nearly 7 million individuals.</p>
<p>We can bridge the language and access gap by organizing multilingual volunteers around culture and community.</p>

We’ll use this fall’s local elections in key cities to test what we’ve built--matching volunteers and voters to find them support as they go to the polls.

We’ll test VoterVOX with partners during primary season to ensure that everything works as intended, and tweak the things that don’t. Primaries are cool because we can test state by state, and in each, we’ll have a real election environment that will help us understand more deeply what people need from VoterVOX. July 2016: Hard Launch! We want to roll out well in advance of the 2016 elections, so voters have time to order, fill out, and send in their mail-in ballots.

<h1>We can do this!</h1></figure>
<p>Build a truly accessible tech system is hard work Here's how we'll overcome key risks and challenges:</p>
<h3>Reaching core users</h3>
<p>Letting limited English proficient voters know that resources to help them vote exist is a difficult task. Not only does outreach need to be translated into their language, but many LEP voters are also poor or working-class, and may not have access to the kind of technology our volunteers do. Rolling out VoterVOX means working with community organizations to identify the most effective ways of reaching these users, whether it’s through ethnic media, senior centers, or bus shelter advertisements. Designing VoterVOX means listening to, and learning from, core users themselves, through co-design workshops in communities.</p>
<h3>Training volunteers</h3>
<p>VoterVOX’s translator resource kits, generated by the volunteer community, help lower the barrier to volunteer translators. You don’t have to be a professional translator to help someone vote! Our relationships with youth groups, student clubs, and community organizations will help us reach, and train, volunteers.</p>
<h3>Building accessible technology</h3>
<p>Once limited English proficient voters have found VoterVOX, we want to be sure they can use the tool. That means making our tech accessible for people with slow internet connections, no smartphones, and disabilities. Accessible design is not impossible, but requires intention and good user testing. We’re committed to making sure the tools we build can be used by the people we are building them for, because that’s what justice looks like.</p>

</div></div>","Life in America depends on written materials.Language barriers and discrimination prevent voting access for millions of limited English speakers. Millions of multilingual speakers forget the power they have, from sharing family stories to making sense of vital documents.
We’re 18MR.org, and we’re building a translation matching app called VoterVOX.We need your help now to start building for Fall elections!Our solution creates grassroots, scalable access to voting.VoterVOX is a matching app that connects multilingual Asian or Pacific Islander American volunteers with limited English speakers for fair voting access.This app and network gets every eligible voter a ballot and voting information in their preferred language.Here's how it works:We're creating an ecosystem to bridge digital divides and generation gaps. By partnering with community-based organizations, we'll get in-person translation to limited English speakers where they’re at – libraries, senior centers, and social clubs. We shortcut the need for smartphones and computer classes.One-to-one connections are the building block of strong, healthy communitiesImagine this: you’re from East San Jose, speak fluent English and Vietnamese, and believe your community should have a voice to make their opinion heard. Getting the VoterVOX app connects you to a person that a local community partners identifies as needing assistance. You meet at a library, share stories, and translate ballot terms and jargon. After you say goodbye to your new friend, they send their mail-in ballot themselves (because that is the law). You can make the process easier for others volunteers by upload your ballot translation and sharing your story. Democracy!Who's talking about VoterVOX?































VoterVOX makes democracy accessible in every language.

But isn't democracy already accessible to everyone?
Right now, our election system is messy and discriminatory.
Imagine voting as a new citizen. It might take years after coming to the United States in order to become eligible to vote. On election day, you make it to your polling place and make it through the line – only to receive an English-language ballot that you can’t figure out. You don’t know exactly what you’re voting for, or how to correctly fill it in. Poll workers give you the cold shoulder because they can’t really understand you, either.
Frustrated and intimidated, you give up your political voice.
Even if you’re fluent in English, struggling with bureaucracy is real. Add the layer of a language barrier, and it becomes nearly impossible. Voting is particularly difficult, and since Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters speak so many different languages and dialects, they are at special risk of being excluded.


We know that people with limited English proficiency are just as smart or smarter than people who are fluent in English – some may be our family elders. And AAPI voters want to vote, but they face barriers at every step. According to a 2012 exit poll from the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, nearly 1 in 4 Asian Americans prefer to vote with help from an interpreter or translated materials. And while the Voting Rights Act mandates translated voting ballots and materials, it’s only sometimes enforced, and only applies to districts with a “significant” number of citizens, determined by the Census. Meanwhile, the last Census is already 5 years out of date, and AAPIs are the fastest-growing racial demographic. The American Community Survey estimates the number of AAPIs who speak English less than fluently at nearly 7 million individuals.

<p>Ever since purchasing my first flash
 drive in 2005, I have always felt the need to create a durable flash 
drive. Plastic drives would never last, and would always break apart. It
 was also a real pain to have to stick your whole keychain, with the 
flashdrive into a USB port. The only other option was to unscrew off the
 flash drive off the keychain, which itself was a nuisance. </p>
<p>The 
other problem was the cap, which would always get lost. Some drives 
didn't even come with caps, and dust and water would eventually get into
 the USB and render it unusable. Amidst all these issues, I finally got 
the idea to design a drive that was metal, durable, capless, and could 
instantly clip off and on your keychain. I didn't want to just make a 
good USB flash drive, I wanted to make the ULTIMATE USB flash drive, one
 that would solve every potential setback. And that's when I invented 
the Nayano Outrider.</p>

<p><b>My Story</b></p>
<p>8 Months ago when I sat in front of my new G27 wheel and put on my Oculus rift DK2 I was blown away by the immersive experience of driving games in VR. I wondered where it could take us next and imagined sitting in a simulator seat feeling the lean of the corners, acceleration and braking G's.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""VR on the horizon."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/670/758/e5ca818e99a28bf6eae5b4a683be4f99_original.jpg?w=456&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1460034976&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=29e66f0df430b4c097f34f25cef2258d"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>So I started looking, looking for a motion simulator seat and what I 
found disappointed me! The cheapest motion platform that actually moved 
in a way I imagined cost around £16,000! It was only available for the 
PC, requires custom software and a lot of configuring. Others out there 
can go into the hundreds of thousands of pounds! Don't get me wrong, 
there are some impressive simulators out there and I have tried my hands
 on a few but was unable to find any affordable plug and play motion 
simulator seats for consoles.. </p>
<p>There were other options, ones 
that seemed to go through a lot of effort to only jerk you in your seat 
giving you an almost jaw breaking road feel, others had fixed screens 
and moving seats which seemed a bit odd. Yet again for motion it always 
came back to a ""PC Only"" I wanted one that would sweep me through the 
corners, feel the acceleration and braking without rattling my teeth out
 my head. I thought that was it, my dream of owning my own was over.</p>
<p>So,
 I started to look into building my own but found there were no easy 
solutions for the casual gamer. You would need your own £1000 gaming PC 
along with additional expensive components just to get started. There is
 nothing out there available for console gamers. Nothing that is plug 
and play out of the box. I want to just turn it on, plug my wheel into 
my PS4 and press start! That's it…</p>
<p></p>
<p>So I made a wish list for what I wanted....</p>
<p>1) Needs to at least move, side to side - forward and back.</p>

<p><b>Prototype</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the last 7 months I have built 2 working prototypes and

literally break it! If I know where it's weakness is i'm in a position 
to further improve. So far we have failed in causing any damage or even 
coming close! <div>
<p>What this tells me is it's ready... It works! and 
all that's left to do is give it some final design polish a bit of style
 and a chance for others to enjoy. The all important Mechanical and Electrical aspects are performing perfectly and these won't change at all in the V1.0 version.<br/></p>

to start full batch production and get these out there for all you 
causal gamers to enjoy.</div>
<p></p>
<p><b>Experience</b></p>
<p>My current job as an Operations Manager at an engineering company has given me valuable project management experience allowing me to structure the completion of the product in a business like way. I gave myself targets to meet, material procurement goals, further research on latest manufacturing technologies and services as well as a good records and understanding of the entire manufacturing process - start to finish.</p>
<p>With previous hands on experience in electronics, welding, CNC machining, laser cutting, fabrication and pretty much every type of production manufacturing process out there I feel I'm in a great position to get these motion simulator seats finalized and more besides sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><b>Indiegogo funding</b></p>
<p>A successful campaign would allow me to leave my current job to work on this full time in new unit space and assemble the first 14 platforms, I am already sending out parts for quotation, procurement and machining. I have everything I need to start manufacturing except the all important cash flow to get me up and running.</p>
<p><b>Stretch Goals</b><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Goal 1 £4200 Unit Space for first 3 months.</li>
<li>Goal 2 £3500 Tooling, Jigs and Equipment.</li>
<li>Goal 3 £300 Ecommerce.</li>
<li>Goal 4 £950 Accounting and Admin.</li>
<li>Goal 5 £9200 First four Perk Motion Platforms for manufacture &amp; delivery.<br/>
</li>
<li>Goal 6 £4200 2 months personal cover leaving current employment.</li>
<li>Goal 7 £4500 Large Van for personal delivery and setup in UK.<br/>
</li>
<li>Goal 8 £1600 On Insurance and product inspection Indygogo fees.</li>
<li>Goal 9 £24900 Second Batch of 10 for Perks plus fees<br/>
</li>
<li>Goal 10 £TBC Any further funding would allow in house machining and further reduced raw platform costs when selling direct from our website in the future.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>Total backing required £53,350.00<br/><br/><p>Additional funding over my setup goal would allow me to further purchase equipment for in house staff, CNC machining, Welding, Painting and larger assembly space giving me the chance to greatly reduce the price of a platform to potentially under £2600!</p>
<p>I in the process of laying legitimate company foundations and currently finalizing the new website now <a href=""http://www.caniseng.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.caniseng.com</a> . I'm ready to hit the ground running and with your help achieve this goal much sooner. Please help me to bring this exciting time for sim gaming and VR to everyone.</p>
<p>With passion over profits I just want share my product with the world.</p>
<p><b>Risks and personal experience</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>I have been a mechanical Engineer all my working life. My job for the last 7 years has been an Operations Manager responsible for bringing various engineering projects together with a view to problem solving design issues and producing products in a cost efficient, quality and timely way. With new office based skills learnt I have been able to bring my hands on knowledge to a more professional level.</p>
<p>Prior experience with hands on machining, welding, fabrication and tool making has given me practical knowledge and understanding of motion control, structural strength and fabrication. I have great experience in software programming, PLC, CNC and 3D Cad software as well as electronics and power distribution.</p>
<p>Combining all my skill feels like I was destined to bring this product to market for the casual gamer. It ticks all the boxes for both my professional experience and personal interests.</p>
<p>With the funds I will be building the first wave of simulators. I have personally invested thousands of pounds and hours in development bringing it to this stage. </p>
<p>The last thing I would be comfortable doing is promising an end product without proving it to myself first, the risks at this point are minimal. </p>
<p>It works and I am struggling to see how at the end of this initial funding stage any backers won't be in possession of a all in one motion simulator. The amount I need will enable me to finance the layout of the first 14 and put in place the relevant tooling and layout for further production.</p>
<p>If anything fails on any of the motion platforms I will do my best personally and financially to rectify the issues. This could be any electrical or mechanical failure or even extend to a re-call for full modification and re-fit down the line. I appreciate this is V1.0 and there may be posibilities for failed parts or components.</p>
<p>There is no better critic or road tester than the public and I intend to take on board any and all comments or criticism with a view for future version improvements.</p>
<p>I will be having the platform independently inspected by qualified electricians, health and safety professionals and public liability insurers as part of the typical new product process.</p>
<p>Feel free to pose questions and I will do my best to answer.</p>
<p>yours sincerely</p>
<p>Jason Daysh</p>

Images below are 3D rendered images of the final product design which is fully representative of V1.0 build planned.

 

 
My Story
8 Months ago when I sat in front of my new G27 wheel and put on my Oculus rift DK2 I was blown away by the immersive experience of driving games in VR. I wondered where it could take us next and imagined sitting in a simulator seat feeling the lean of the corners, acceleration and braking G's.

 

So I started looking, looking for a motion simulator seat and what I 
found disappointed me! The cheapest motion platform that actually moved 
in a way I imagined cost around £16,000! It was only available for the 
PC, requires custom software and a lot of configuring. Others out there 
can go into the hundreds of thousands of pounds! Don't get me wrong, 
there are some impressive simulators out there and I have tried my hands
 on a few but was unable to find any affordable plug and play motion 
simulator seats for consoles.. 
There were other options, ones 
that seemed to go through a lot of effort to only jerk you in your seat 
giving you an almost jaw breaking road feel, others had fixed screens 
and moving seats which seemed a bit odd. Yet again for motion it always 
came back to a ""PC Only"" I wanted one that would sweep me through the 
corners, feel the acceleration and braking without rattling my teeth out
 my head. I thought that was it, my dream of owning my own was over.
So,
 I started to look into building my own but found there were no easy 
solutions for the casual gamer. You would need your own £1000 gaming PC 
along with additional expensive components just to get started. There is
 nothing out there available for console gamers. Nothing that is plug 
and play out of the box. I want to just turn it on, plug my wheel into 
my PS4 and press start! That's it…

So I made a wish list for what I wanted....
1) Needs to at least move, side to side - forward and back.

 
2) XBOX One, PC, or PS4 & PS3 compatible.

 3) Quality Force Feedback Wheel, pedals, Shifter. 
4) Full 5:1 surround sound with built in seat bass shakers.

 
5) Choice of adjustable Bucket Seating

 
6) Built in screen options

 
7) Compatible with all the top driving games.

 
 8) Compatible with top flight games.

 
8) Simple plug and play in using 1 power socket, 1 USB & 1 HDMI.

 
9) Adjustable sensitivity independently on Steering and Pedals built into the seat.
Well this is exactly what I have achieved and can produce these initial batches for sale under £3000 all in! 
With additional funding to be used on in house machining I plan to get them produced and on sale for under £2600! This includes everything listed above apart from your gaming console or PC...
Prototype

Over the last 7 months I have built 2 working prototypes and 
undergone many design changes in which my latest model has out-performed
 my best expectations for power, strength, cooling, ergonomics & 
motion feedback.

I have put it through it's paces by inviting friends over for racing
 gaming parties to give it a good thrashing in the hope I am able to 
literally break it! If I know where it's weakness is i'm in a position 
to further improve. So far we have failed in causing any damage or even 
coming close! 
What this tells me is it's ready... It works! and 
all that's left to do is give it some final design polish a bit of style
 and a chance for others to enjoy. The all important Mechanical and Electrical aspects are performing perfectly and these won't change at all in the V1.0 version.

So all the major nail biting development work is done. I'm ready now 
to start full batch production and get these out there for all you 
causal gamers to enjoy.

Experience
My current job as an Operations Manager at an engineering company has given me valuable project management experience allowing me to structure the completion of the product in a business like way. I gave myself targets to meet, material procurement goals, further research on latest manufacturing technologies and services as well as a good records and understanding of the entire manufacturing process - start to finish.
With previous hands on experience in electronics, welding, CNC machining, laser cutting, fabrication and pretty much every type of production manufacturing process out there I feel I'm in a great position to get these motion simulator seats finalized and more besides sooner rather than later.
Indiegogo funding
A successful campaign would allow me to leave my current job to work on this full time in new unit space and assemble the first 14 platforms, I am already sending out parts for quotation, procurement and machining. I have everything I need to start manufacturing except the all important cash flow to get me up and running.
Stretch Goals

Goal 1 £4200 Unit Space for first 3 months.
Goal 2 £3500 Tooling, Jigs and Equipment.
Goal 3 £300 Ecommerce.
Goal 4 £950 Accounting and Admin.
Goal 5 £9200 First four Perk Motion Platforms for manufacture & delivery.

Goal 6 £4200 2 months personal cover leaving current employment.
Goal 7 £4500 Large Van for personal delivery and setup in UK.

Goal 8 £1600 On Insurance and product inspection Indygogo fees.
Goal 9 £24900 Second Batch of 10 for Perks plus fees

Goal 10 £TBC Any further funding would allow in house machining and further reduced raw platform costs when selling direct from our website in the future.


Total backing required £53,350.00Additional funding over my setup goal would allow me to further purchase equipment for in house staff, CNC machining, Welding, Painting and larger assembly space giving me the chance to greatly reduce the price of a platform to potentially under £2600!
I in the process of laying legitimate company foundations and currently finalizing the new website now www.caniseng.com . I'm ready to hit the ground running and with your help achieve this goal much sooner. Please help me to bring this exciting time for sim gaming and VR to everyone.
With passion over profits I just want share my product with the world.
Risks and personal experience

I have been a mechanical Engineer all my working life. My job for the last 7 years has been an Operations Manager responsible for bringing various engineering projects together with a view to problem solving design issues and producing products in a cost efficient, quality and timely way. With new office based skills learnt I have been able to bring my hands on knowledge to a more professional level.
Prior experience with hands on machining, welding, fabrication and tool making has given me practical knowledge and understanding of motion control, structural strength and fabrication. I have great experience in software programming, PLC, CNC and 3D Cad software as well as electronics and power distribution.
Combining all my skill feels like I was destined to bring this product to market for the casual gamer. It ticks all the boxes for both my professional experience and personal interests.
With the funds I will be building the first wave of simulators. I have personally invested thousands of pounds and hours in development bringing it to this stage. 
The last thing I would be comfortable doing is promising an end product without proving it to myself first, the risks at this point are minimal. 
It works and I am struggling to see how at the end of this initial funding stage any backers won't be in possession of a all in one motion simulator. The amount I need will enable me to finance the layout of the first 14 and put in place the relevant tooling and layout for further production.
If anything fails on any of the motion platforms I will do my best personally and financially to rectify the issues. This could be any electrical or mechanical failure or even extend to a re-call for full modification and re-fit down the line. I appreciate this is V1.0 and there may be posibilities for failed parts or components.
There is no better critic or road tester than the public and I intend to take on board any and all comments or criticism with a view for future version improvements.
I will be having the platform independently inspected by qualified electricians, health and safety professionals and public liability insurers as part of the typical new product process.
Feel free to pose questions and I will do my best to answer.
yours sincerely
Jason Daysh

<h2>FAQ.</h2>
<div>
<p><i>ABOUT THE HARDWARE</i></p>
<p><b>Q: </b>Do I need a special mobile or external hardware to use
Brailling?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> No! We're improving Brailling every day so that everyone
can use it easily in every mobile. You can download the demo app for Android.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Does it drain all the battery?  </p>
<p><b>A: </b>No. The mobile is going to vibrate in different modes,
and make a sound in some cases, for a better experience. You can disable these
options or watch the Tutorial again if you have any doubts. These actions are
not going to consume a lot of battery.</p>
<p><i>ABOUT THE SOFTWARE</i></p>
<p><b>Q: </b>In how many languages is Brailling going to be?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> At first, in English. We're from Argentina and we want to
reach more countries in the future, so everyone can share this great experience.
You can write in any language though* because Braille is a traditional system
which lets you write in any language indeed.</p>
<p>*We only allow 64 combinations of letters and special
characters at the moment. With your help, we're 
going to improve this, expand and have the app in more languages.</p>
<p><b>Q: </b>Does Brailling have a native screen reader?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>No. You're going to use your regular screen reader, so
you're familiar with it. You're going to write in Braille in silence and, when
you have to read a message, you can use headphones to listen to it.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> How many opportunities and features does Brailling have for
visually impaired people?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> A lot! We're going to give you privacy when you write, not allowing others to watch
your screen. You
can write faster than before, in Braille. Once you're familiar with this
system, you must only learn how to use our commands (you can learn pretty
quickly) and you will be able to speak with anyone around the world! You can
look up contacts, read old messages, write new messages and it's easy for visually
impaired people. </p>
<p><b>Q: </b>How does the Braille keyboard function?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> It's easy. When someone writes in Braille, this is going
to be automatically translated with the correspondent letter for the receiver,
so that he or she can read or hear the message and respond. To write a message,
you must touch the screen, without lifting the finger, and feel the vibrations.
You're going to recognize the different positions from the Braille keyboard.
With a few commands of Brailling, you can send the message, delete words,
delete letters, write, read, look for contacts and more!</p>
<p><b>Q: </b>How can the people who see write with Brailling?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>The app is going to have two different interfaces: one
for blinds and, the other one, for those who can see. The blinds are going to
have all the advantages and anyone can use it really. If you want to change the
interface, you can do it from the setup options section.</p>

A little bit about us.


We are Brailling ©, the first mobile messaging application for visually impaired people developed in Argentina.
We want to improve the life of those who can’t take advantage of today's technologies and include them.




What is it and how does it work?
Mechanical and technical demonstrations.


If you don’t know about Braille, think of six circles distributed in two columns –each one has three circles. We can do 64 different combinations in this board, and each combination is a different letter or special character.
How does it work? It's easy. On the main screen, when texting users, the Braille board shows six empty circles. The user can feel the screen -looking for the exact location of those circles- and the mobile will vibrate smoothly, showing where the circles are. When the user touches one of the circles, the mobile will vibrate more loudly.

  
  



At first, we have six different positions: a1 - b1; a2 - b2; a3 – b3. Each combination represents a letter or a special character that the users can form just by touching a given one.

Making the dream come true.

The person must use one of the respective commands to write a letter and enter a space, so as to write messages of certain length and send them to the receiver by touching the screen three times.

We can all use the app, not only blind or visually impaired people.This application is available for the whole tech community. You can speak with people who don’t see and they can speak to you by writing a message in Braille. 
The app is going to translate what was said. It is reciprocal. You send a message in your language and, when this message shows up on the receiver's screen, this is going to be translated and read out loud by our system.***

FAQ.

ABOUT THE HARDWARE
Q: Do I need a special mobile or external hardware to use
Brailling?
A: No! We're improving Brailling every day so that everyone
can use it easily in every mobile. You can download the demo app for Android.
Q: Does it drain all the battery?  
A: No. The mobile is going to vibrate in different modes,
and make a sound in some cases, for a better experience. You can disable these
options or watch the Tutorial again if you have any doubts. These actions are
not going to consume a lot of battery.
ABOUT THE SOFTWARE
Q: In how many languages is Brailling going to be?
A: At first, in English. We're from Argentina and we want to
reach more countries in the future, so everyone can share this great experience.
You can write in any language though* because Braille is a traditional system
which lets you write in any language indeed.
*We only allow 64 combinations of letters and special
characters at the moment. With your help, we're 
going to improve this, expand and have the app in more languages.
Q: Does Brailling have a native screen reader?
A: No. You're going to use your regular screen reader, so
you're familiar with it. You're going to write in Braille in silence and, when
you have to read a message, you can use headphones to listen to it.
Q: How many opportunities and features does Brailling have for
visually impaired people?
A: A lot! We're going to give you privacy when you write, not allowing others to watch
your screen. You
can write faster than before, in Braille. Once you're familiar with this
system, you must only learn how to use our commands (you can learn pretty
quickly) and you will be able to speak with anyone around the world! You can
look up contacts, read old messages, write new messages and it's easy for visually
impaired people. 
Q: How does the Braille keyboard function?
A: It's easy. When someone writes in Braille, this is going
to be automatically translated with the correspondent letter for the receiver,
so that he or she can read or hear the message and respond. To write a message,
you must touch the screen, without lifting the finger, and feel the vibrations.
You're going to recognize the different positions from the Braille keyboard.
With a few commands of Brailling, you can send the message, delete words,
delete letters, write, read, look for contacts and more!
Q: How can the people who see write with Brailling?
A: The app is going to have two different interfaces: one
for blinds and, the other one, for those who can see. The blinds are going to
have all the advantages and anyone can use it really. If you want to change the
interface, you can do it from the setup options section.

<p><a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/artificial-maturity/201409/nomophobia-rising-trend-in-students"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nomophobia</a> - the fear of being without one's smartphone - is real and effects about half the population.  Constantly checking for emails, texts, tweets, and updates is a very dangerous habit - and possible addiction - that needs to be addressed.</p>
<h3>Cell Phone Laws are Ineffective </h3>
<p>To combat this problem, <a href=""http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/laws/cellphonelaws/maptextingbans?topicName=Distracted%20driving#map"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">46 states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation that bans texting while driving</a>, but these laws are very hard to enforce and have proven ineffective - just like corporate cell phone policies.    </p>
<p>Our challenge is finding a solution that allows cell phones to notify drivers of incoming calls or texts, while eliminating the temptation to take their eyes off the road.  </p>
<h3>Introducing the Shellback Smartphone Safe</h3>
<p>Faced with this real world problem, brothers Michael and Thomas Maguire decided to solve it. Both brothers have experience managing fleets or salespeople who drive in their territories every day. Tom has two teenage sons - one that recently received his driver's license and another who will start driver's education soon.</p>
<p>Their simple solution is an intelligent cell phone case that allows drivers to store their cell phones out-of-sight inside a <strong><u><a href=""http://liveundistracted.com/smart-phone-safe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shellback ""Smartphone Safe</a></u>""</strong> and removes the urge to check their cell phone screens while driving. </p>
<h3>How Does a Smartphone Safe Work?</h3>
<p>The Smartphone Safe is an intelligent cell phone case that <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/shellback-offers-teenagers-parents-intelligent-113000432.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">parents</a> or <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/cci-signs-fleet-cell-phone-113000721.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fleet managers can use to store phones out-of-site and prevent drivers from viewing their cell phone screens</a>. Cell phones can still receive calls and messages, but drivers cannot see the phone.  </p>
<p>Once cell phones are paired and stored inside the Smartphone Safe, a green light on the outside of the case indicates it is now safe to drive. Real time transmissions allow parents and fleet managers to verify that drivers will experience zero cell phone distractions while out on the road.</p>
<h3>Smartphone Safe Main Features:</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485973084/yygndnntu6lao4ijah8u.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Knowledge is Power </h3>
<p>The Smartphone Safe also comes with a Live Undistracted Cell Phone App that runs on both Apple iPhones and Android Smartphones. The app continuously monitors sensors inside the case to ensure that cell phones remained locked inside while the vehicle is moving.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_400/v1485973159/gfkfc2avgkdzfsygtynu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Should the driver decide to open the case while driving it will automatically send an alert to parents or fleet managers - notifying them that the phone is now accessible.  The real time alert provides the ability to address this dangerous behavior before an accident occurs.  </p>
<p>The information is also stored in a database so that parents and fleet managers can review daily, weekly, monthly, or annual reports.  We can provide compliance reports for a single driver or an entire fleet of thousands of autos, trucks, school buses, vans, utility vehicles, etc. </p>
<h3>Smartphone Safes: the Best Monitoring Tool </h3>
<p>Smartphone Safes are the single best way to monitor cell phones and guarantee that cell phone safety policies are being obeyed at all times. It can also be used by driver education schools to teach kids a new methodology for driving with a cell phone. It only takes a few minutes to pull over to a safe parking spot, take the cell phone out of the case, make a call, send a text, check an email, store it back in the case and then head back out on the road safely to their next destination. Training kids and adults to keep their eyes on the road 100% of the time while driving will significantly reduce the number of accidents and deaths caused by cell phones.</p>
<h3>Smartphone Safes vs the Competition:</h3>
<p>There are a few cell phone apps, hardware gadgets, and driver cameras in the marketplace, but none of them prevent drivers from reading their smartphone screens. The Shellback Smartphone Safe is the ONLY product that stores the cell phone out-of-sight and effectively eliminates a driver's ability to read their cell phones while driving. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://liveundistracted.com/smart-phone-safe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485982510/pfusgzvq7cui6leho9pt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<h3>How Do We Plan to Spend the Money</h3>
<p>Mike and Tom spoke to countless parents and businesses which validated the need to address distracted driving.  Everyone agreed this was a growing problem - but no one had a solution. The brothers were convinced the only way to solve the problem was to eliminate the phone.  They teamed with an engineering firm, <a href=""http://www.finishlinepds.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Finishline Product Development Services</a>, to work out the design requirements, draw up cell phone case designs, engineer the case's intelligent sensors, program a cell phone app and develop the functioning prototypes.  The result of all this work is the Shellback SmartPhone Safe.</p>
<p>The team is now ready to go into full production and meet the market place demand. We have a contract manufacturer lined up and we are ready to place our first order that will be used to fulfill orders from this Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign and generate enough revenue to conduct a follow-up equity crowdfunding campaign in 12 to 18 months.</p>

<p>Peace of Mind. Since the onset of mobile technology, our roads have become increasingly dangerous. You no longer have the simple peace of mind knowing your loved ones are driving safely. With the Smartphone Safe you now have a simple way to prevent accidents before they happen.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Help make our roads safer for everyone.  We are all aware of the distracted driving epidemic.  </li>
<li>Support our goal to help young drivers and quite possibly save lives.    </li>
<li>Knowledge is Power. No longer assume your drivers are following the rules. Be 100% sure. </li>
</ul>
<p>Be the first to get one.  No other solution like it exists.  Start living undistracted now with a Shellback Smartphone Safe!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal </h3>
<p>We want to make the roads safer and help everyone live and drive undistracted.  We all know the phone is a major distraction for drivers.  <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2014/03/28/cellphone-use-1-in-4-car-crashes/7018505/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Distracted driving is responsible for 25% of all accidents</a>.  The Smartphone Safe is the solution. </p>
<p>If the phone is out-of-sight, the driver will be safer. If the driver is safer we will have less accidents. If we have less accidents we will all benefit.    </p>
<p>Quite simply - our campaign hopes to prevent accidents and possibly save lives.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is a Smartphone Safe?</h3>
<p>The Smartphone Safe is an intelligent case that secures the phone out-of-sight.  The embedded technology confirms and reports phone location and status.  </p>
<p>Most distracted driving solutions today focus on the car, the driver, or apps.  The Smartphone Safe focuses on the phone.  It is the only solution that secures the phone out-of-sight and eliminates the possibility of distraction.    </p>
<p>The world's only fool-proof way to eliminate distracted driving due to smartphones – the Smartphone Safe syncs with your phone and tracks when it is stored out-of-sight while driving.  It sends real time notifications whenever the phone is removed from the case while driving.   </p>
<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>The Smartphone Safe connects to your smartphone over a Bluetooth connection.  It confirms the phone is out-of-sight (the phone goes in the case), reports on device usage in real time (you will know if the case is opened or closed), and tracks data and presents it in a useful way (Cloud-based SQL database and dashboards.)   </p>
<p>Once you connect Smartphone Safe to your phone, the Live Undistracted App – available on Android and iOS  will continuously monitor your phone status and let you know when the phone is removed from the case.</p>
<h3>Smartphone Safe Compliance Reporting </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Not following the rules? - </strong>The Smartphone Safe sends out an immediate alert when a driver decides to take the phone out of the case when driving.  This data allows you to take action before an accident happens.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Two phones? - </strong>The Smartphone Safe can handle multiple phones.  Our patent-pending technology determines the exact phone or phones that should be in the case and notifies the driver that the phones are now safely stored for safe driving.  This could be helpful for those of us that have both a work and personal phone. </li>
<li>
<strong>Minimal Data Usage - </strong>The SPS App utilizes minimal data to track both the speed and location of the driver.  All data is tracked in the cloud and only alerts due to unsafe conditions are pushed out.   </li>
<li>
<strong>Battery Technology - </strong>The Smartphone Safe comes with a fully rechargeable battery that will last up to 40 hours per charge with average use.   </li>
<li>
<strong>The Case - </strong>The Smartphone Safe is made of rugged materials and guaranteed for one year.  It is dust-proof and water splash proof.  Integrated lights and audible alerts indicate when it is safe to drive.   </li>
<li>
<strong>The Software - </strong>All activity is tracked in real time and uploaded to our cloud-based server.  Data is stored in  a SQL database and converted to simple to use dashboards.  Alerts are sent directly to our clients via SMS text or email. The Smartphone Safe sends out an immediate alert when a driver decides to take the phone out of the case when driving.  This data allows you to take action before an accident happens.</li>

</div></div>","Shellback Smartphone Safes Eliminate Distracted Driving by Storing Cell Phones Out-of-Sight Inside a Closed Case 

 
It is no secret that distracted drivers are causing thousands of unnecessary deaths and millions of accidents every year because drivers are taking their eyes off the road to read their cell phone screen's messages, social media apps and videos. 
The problem has become a true epidemic and is getting worse!
Cell Phone Distracted Driving Statistics
A recent AT&T survey reports that 98% of drivers agree that texting and driving is a very dangerous habit, but 49% of the same respondents also admitted that they still sent texts, checked social media sites and/or talked on their phones while driving.  

Did You Know That:

Auto accidents are the #1 cause of teen deaths

Cell phone use causes 1 out of 4 car accidents


More than 3,000 people died in accidents last year caused by distraction due to cell phones
In addition, cell phone distraction was a factor in over 1.6 million wrecks last year

Drivers are 2300% more likely to have an accident when texting while driving

23% of teens feel the need to respond immediately to texts
Texting while driving is 6x worse than driving drunk

Please watch these videos to get a sense of how bad the epidemic has grown with regards to how many teen and adult drivers are losing their lives due to distracted drivers that are reading their cell phone screens to check out texts and smartphone apps while driving:
 Smartphone Addiction 
AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and other mobile wireless carriers all recognize that people have a tremendous urge to see what news, messages or emails just dinged their cell phones.
Nomophobia - the fear of being without one's smartphone - is real and effects about half the population.  Constantly checking for emails, texts, tweets, and updates is a very dangerous habit - and possible addiction - that needs to be addressed.
Cell Phone Laws are Ineffective 
To combat this problem, 46 states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation that bans texting while driving, but these laws are very hard to enforce and have proven ineffective - just like corporate cell phone policies.    
Our challenge is finding a solution that allows cell phones to notify drivers of incoming calls or texts, while eliminating the temptation to take their eyes off the road.  
Introducing the Shellback Smartphone Safe
Faced with this real world problem, brothers Michael and Thomas Maguire decided to solve it. Both brothers have experience managing fleets or salespeople who drive in their territories every day. Tom has two teenage sons - one that recently received his driver's license and another who will start driver's education soon.
Their simple solution is an intelligent cell phone case that allows drivers to store their cell phones out-of-sight inside a Shellback ""Smartphone Safe"" and removes the urge to check their cell phone screens while driving. 
How Does a Smartphone Safe Work?
The Smartphone Safe is an intelligent cell phone case that parents or fleet managers can use to store phones out-of-site and prevent drivers from viewing their cell phone screens. Cell phones can still receive calls and messages, but drivers cannot see the phone.  
Once cell phones are paired and stored inside the Smartphone Safe, a green light on the outside of the case indicates it is now safe to drive. Real time transmissions allow parents and fleet managers to verify that drivers will experience zero cell phone distractions while out on the road.
Smartphone Safe Main Features:

 
Knowledge is Power 
The Smartphone Safe also comes with a Live Undistracted Cell Phone App that runs on both Apple iPhones and Android Smartphones. The app continuously monitors sensors inside the case to ensure that cell phones remained locked inside while the vehicle is moving.

Should the driver decide to open the case while driving it will automatically send an alert to parents or fleet managers - notifying them that the phone is now accessible.  The real time alert provides the ability to address this dangerous behavior before an accident occurs.  
The information is also stored in a database so that parents and fleet managers can review daily, weekly, monthly, or annual reports.  We can provide compliance reports for a single driver or an entire fleet of thousands of autos, trucks, school buses, vans, utility vehicles, etc. 
Smartphone Safes: the Best Monitoring Tool 
Smartphone Safes are the single best way to monitor cell phones and guarantee that cell phone safety policies are being obeyed at all times. It can also be used by driver education schools to teach kids a new methodology for driving with a cell phone. It only takes a few minutes to pull over to a safe parking spot, take the cell phone out of the case, make a call, send a text, check an email, store it back in the case and then head back out on the road safely to their next destination. Training kids and adults to keep their eyes on the road 100% of the time while driving will significantly reduce the number of accidents and deaths caused by cell phones.
Smartphone Safes vs the Competition:
There are a few cell phone apps, hardware gadgets, and driver cameras in the marketplace, but none of them prevent drivers from reading their smartphone screens. The Shellback Smartphone Safe is the ONLY product that stores the cell phone out-of-sight and effectively eliminates a driver's ability to read their cell phones while driving. 

How Do We Plan to Spend the Money
Mike and Tom spoke to countless parents and businesses which validated the need to address distracted driving.  Everyone agreed this was a growing problem - but no one had a solution. The brothers were convinced the only way to solve the problem was to eliminate the phone.  They teamed with an engineering firm, Finishline Product Development Services, to work out the design requirements, draw up cell phone case designs, engineer the case's intelligent sensors, program a cell phone app and develop the functioning prototypes.  The result of all this work is the Shellback SmartPhone Safe.
The team is now ready to go into full production and meet the market place demand. We have a contract manufacturer lined up and we are ready to place our first order that will be used to fulfill orders from this Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign and generate enough revenue to conduct a follow-up equity crowdfunding campaign in 12 to 18 months.
We need $50,000 in this initial campaign to:

Further test of our prototypes 
Finalizing the manufacturing designs
Finalizing engineering schematics

Developing the dashboards 
Developing and iterating on the user experience for the mobile app
First production run & fulfilling all of our perks 

We will soon begin the process of:

Designing retail packaging
Generating product certifications
Building sales and distribution channels

Please Help Us End Distracted Driving 
Contributors can help save lives of their loved ones, employees, or complete  strangers through our young driver matching program.  For every ten contributions directed to our partners - we will send one free Smartphone Safe to either PADD.org or Nikki Cline (East Surrey High School) to provide to new drivers in memory of her son Gage Edwards. Nikki, says  ""It warms my heart every time I see a person or company be as passionate as I am working towards trying to prevent the avoidable tragedies that can occur from distracted driving.""


Why Should You Support Us?
Peace of Mind. Since the onset of mobile technology, our roads have become increasingly dangerous. You no longer have the simple peace of mind knowing your loved ones are driving safely. With the Smartphone Safe you now have a simple way to prevent accidents before they happen.  

Help make our roads safer for everyone.  We are all aware of the distracted driving epidemic.  
Support our goal to help young drivers and quite possibly save lives.    
Knowledge is Power. No longer assume your drivers are following the rules. Be 100% sure. 

Be the first to get one.  No other solution like it exists.  Start living undistracted now with a Shellback Smartphone Safe!

Our Goal 
We want to make the roads safer and help everyone live and drive undistracted.  We all know the phone is a major distraction for drivers.  Distracted driving is responsible for 25% of all accidents.  The Smartphone Safe is the solution. 
If the phone is out-of-sight, the driver will be safer. If the driver is safer we will have less accidents. If we have less accidents we will all benefit.    
Quite simply - our campaign hopes to prevent accidents and possibly save lives.  

What is a Smartphone Safe?
The Smartphone Safe is an intelligent case that secures the phone out-of-sight.  The embedded technology confirms and reports phone location and status.  
Most distracted driving solutions today focus on the car, the driver, or apps.  The Smartphone Safe focuses on the phone.  It is the only solution that secures the phone out-of-sight and eliminates the possibility of distraction.    
The world's only fool-proof way to eliminate distracted driving due to smartphones – the Smartphone Safe syncs with your phone and tracks when it is stored out-of-sight while driving.  It sends real time notifications whenever the phone is removed from the case while driving.   
How Does It Work?
The Smartphone Safe connects to your smartphone over a Bluetooth connection.  It confirms the phone is out-of-sight (the phone goes in the case), reports on device usage in real time (you will know if the case is opened or closed), and tracks data and presents it in a useful way (Cloud-based SQL database and dashboards.)   
Once you connect Smartphone Safe to your phone, the Live Undistracted App – available on Android and iOS  will continuously monitor your phone status and let you know when the phone is removed from the case.
Smartphone Safe Compliance Reporting 


Not following the rules? - The Smartphone Safe sends out an immediate alert when a driver decides to take the phone out of the case when driving.  This data allows you to take action before an accident happens.  

Two phones? - The Smartphone Safe can handle multiple phones.  Our patent-pending technology determines the exact phone or phones that should be in the case and notifies the driver that the phones are now safely stored for safe driving.  This could be helpful for those of us that have both a work and personal phone. 

Minimal Data Usage - The SPS App utilizes minimal data to track both the speed and location of the driver.  All data is tracked in the cloud and only alerts due to unsafe conditions are pushed out.   

Battery Technology - The Smartphone Safe comes with a fully rechargeable battery that will last up to 40 hours per charge with average use.   

The Case - The Smartphone Safe is made of rugged materials and guaranteed for one year.  It is dust-proof and water splash proof.  Integrated lights and audible alerts indicate when it is safe to drive.   

The Software - All activity is tracked in real time and uploaded to our cloud-based server.  Data is stored in  a SQL database and converted to simple to use dashboards.  Alerts are sent directly to our clients via SMS text or email. The Smartphone Safe sends out an immediate alert when a driver decides to take the phone out of the case when driving.  This data allows you to take action before an accident happens.

<h2>Long story</h2>We have
seen a lot of different GPS products, which are great, but yet another device
to carry around. What most of you don't know is that you already have the
perfect GPS product right there with you! The smartphones we use every day, have
already a built-in GPS, GPRS, WIFI and even LBS module. These devices allows us
to locate our loved ones or share our location. SaveYourSelf or “SYS” as we
like to call it, is able to use that data to send a distress signal, share your
location, send an (automated) alert when you are involved in an incident or
accident and makes it able to follow your children or elderly, when they leave their
safe environment.<p></p>

How do I contact Privycam team?Feel free to send us an email at hello@privycam.com and we will get back to you as soon as possible

Where does Privycam ship?Worldwide - We believe that privacy protection should be accessible to everybody regardless of the location and thus have not limited the shipping locations. For our Indiegogo campaign we have also decided to include to shipping in our perks, as another mean to thank you for your great support.The shipping is not included for the Business perk.

What kind of battery does Privycam uses?The best part of it, it is human powered and never runs out of juice (like a human too)!

When my Privycam will be shipped?Our plan is to start shipping during the month of October 2017. Should there be any change in the logistics and fulfilment plans, we will let you know as soon as possible for full transparency.

Will I have to pay duties/VAT to receive my Privycam?Because we ship globally and duties/taxes are different in each country, we cannot retain additional duties/VAT in a manner that is accurate and/or fair for each backer. Any applicable duties/VAT are therefore the responsibility of each backer. If any duties are applicable, these may be charged at the time of receiving the package. To check whether or not there are duties/VAT charged at the time of receiving your reward, please contact your local post office or customs department.

 Wave On is an App developed for Apple and Android. 
Wi Fi, Bluetooth, cell phone signal are surrounding us everyday,  almost everywhere... Using the micro wave sensor of every smart phone, tablet and computer,  Wave On estimates of the quantity of specific electromagnetic radiation you are exposed to, and for how long.  This App offers you a better awareness about a new kind of invisible contamination. 


Different settings allow combinations of visuals (Green, Orange, Red, pulses of colour) and/or audio parameters to show the different levels of micro waves in the environment. You choose how you want to know.

You can get daily, weekly, or monthly reports of your electromagnetic  exposure.

<br/>I want to shoot longer without charging<br/>

them. Val takes care of that.<br/></p>

<h4>I want to get away from holding the camera<br/>
</h4>
<p>Before selfies we had self-timers, and they're what gave us the 
classic family photos of the 80's. Your shoulder shouldn't be the focal 
point in the photo. Going hands free also allows us to feel closer and 
more connected to our remote colleagues or distant friends. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Do you use FaceTime, Skype, Hangouts,
or any other video/streaming to communicate? With Val you will look better,
sound better, always have power, and your selfie arm will never get tired. 


Having Val is like having a professional studio that fits in your hand. 




Who agrees that you should own a Val?


Robert Scoble, American blogger, technical evangelist, and author

Jeff Needles, Business Insights Analyst at Meerkat

Lili Salzberg, Community Manager at Periscope

Daniel Terdiman, Technology Journalist for Fast Company 

Sarah
Evans, CES 2016

Bill Burnett, Executive Director of the Stanford Design Program


And many more - see their thoughts below!
When do I need Val? Anytime I want my video to look and sound fantastic. 


                     Without Val                                              With Val
Val Comes with Everything You Need:


Spring loaded arm accommodates all android and iOS phones in both portrait and Landscape mode
Studio-quality LEDs on the front and back
Built-in Microphone
Speakers
6,000 mAh battery





Val works with any smartphone and any orientation - landscape or portrait

It can even hold your iPad mini so you don't have to!




When Would I Use Val?

I want to look and sound better in my video
 The rise in mobile video technology 
and unicorn apps mean everyone is their own producer. Make your videos 
look professional every time, no matter the conditions.  









I want to shoot longer without charging
 Val's 6,000 mAh battery triples your battery 
life. Most phones last 1-2 hours, limiting the life you can capture on 
them. Val takes care of that.


I want to get away from holding the camera

Before selfies we had self-timers, and they're what gave us the 
classic family photos of the 80's. Your shoulder shouldn't be the focal 
point in the photo. Going hands free also allows us to feel closer and 
more connected to our remote colleagues or distant friends. 




I want to professionalize my video conferencing

Val fits with your existing photography equipment, giving you 
stability and portability. Don't worry, at only a pound, you can still 
use her to take selfies.

<p><b>SOLSOL </b>is our brand-new solution to an old painful problem: a stylish hat with solar cells that charges your dead smartphone or portable device while in the sun. That simple.<br/></p>
<p>Our <b>SOLSOL</b> hats deliver charging power to your iPhone, iPod,
Android phone and other USB charged devices such as GoPro camera’s and portable
battery chargers. As long as the sun shines, you can charge or maintain the
charge of your mobile tech devices. No batteries are included or needed (except
the battery that is already in your device). Same goes for power cables: you’ll
use your own devices’ cable, to make sure it’s the appropriate one!</p>
<p>The <b>SOLSOL</b> hat is eco-friendly too! It lets you make a small
contribution toward reducing our carbon footprint.  Let natural sunlight and our <b>LXTSOL</b>
proprietary electronic power regulator deliver clean power to your tech
products.</p>
<p>Don’t get stuck without power again! Get a <b>SOLSOL</b> hat today
and be a part of the Solar Power Revolution!</p>

<h3>THE PROBLEM.</h3>
<p>Tired of running for power outlets while enjoying a
beautiful day at the park? Still driving around the block with your car waiting
for your phone to charge up at a record-slow speed? Still sitting on airport
floors hooked to a power outlet to text your goodbyes?</p>

<p></p>
<p>We’ve all been there. And we have never been big fans of
power banks. They are cumbersome and bulky, too heavy for the lightweight
backpacker.  In the end, charging all your personal devices adds to your carbon footprint.</p>

<p>We knew there had to be a better way to power our tech gear.
Harvesting energy directly from the sun was the first part of the solution, the
second part, putting that power and tech into the convenience and style of a
hat.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p>This way, we keep our head covered from heavy sun rays AND
have an extra power source to charge our portable devices!</p>
<p><b>SOLSOL </b>hats are that simple. You plug your USB cable at the

<h3><b>SPECIFICATIONS.</b></h3>
<p><b>SOLSOL</b> powers your device when in direct sunlight.
Charging time when the hat is left in constant sunlight exposure vary
accordingly to the device. This is because battery size differs across devices,
along with how the user is using their device and how many apps are open at the
same time.</p>
<p><b>Charging time using a SOLSOL hat.</b></p>
<p>● 
4 X the amount of time it takes your device to charge
from a wall outlet.</p>
<p>● 
2 X the amout of time it takes your device to charge
from a laptop.</p>
<p>Please, remember that when charging your device (smartphones
especially) you have to avoid rapid intermittent sun exposure as this may actually
reduce your battery charge. This happens because the screen can go on and off
and suck up all the battery.</p>
<p><i><b>Here below are the
technical specifications of SOLSOL:</b></i></p>
<p>● 
Maximum Power at STC (Pmax) - 1.45 W</p>
<p>● 
Optimum Operating Voltage (Vmp) - 5.2V</p>
<p>● 
Optimum Operating Current (Imp) - 125mA - 350mA</p>

<p>We at Unique Creative Ideas have experience in the manufacturing process, we know the steps to follow, the controls that we need in place, the type of suppliers needed to produce our hats and to make sure that we are sustainable for mass production.</p>
<p>This is not just an idea or concept: it is a product, ready
for large scale manufacturing. The product has been tested and is ready to be
shared with the world. We have secured not just one supplier but multiple
manufacturers in case there is ever an issue with our first supplier in terms
of both components being manufactured along with assembly and logistics.</p>
<p>Since we are running a flexible funding campaign, in case we don't meet our goal, we will still collect the funds and move forward with our production plan to deliver perks to our backers first.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked
Questions.</h3>
<p>Q:  <b>How soon can I expect to receive my SOLSOL
once I contribute my donation?</b></p>
<p>A:  Our Indiegogo
campaign is for 30 days.  We will begin shipping
30 - 45 days after the close of the campaign 2016.  Please make sure to read the PERKS package
carefully to decide which cap color you want to receive.  First shipments will be no later than April,
2016, just in time for Spring.</p>
<p>Q: <b>How Long Does It
Take the Sun To Charge SOLSOL?</b></p>
<p>A:  There is no
waiting time for SOLSOL to begin to charge. First, it is not a battery. It
charges the battery already in your personal device (phone). Once the sun hits
it, charging kicks in. If you move in and out of the sun, charging will be
intermittent. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Q:  What Type of Battery Does SOLSOL Use?  </b></p>
<p>A:  SOLSOL doesn't
have a battery!  That's why it's so
Cool!  SOLSOL's proprietary LXTSOL Chip
along with SOLSOL's patented solar panel allows SOLSOL to charge many of your
other tech devices!<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p><b>Q:  Does SOLSOL Work Without The Sun?</b></p>
<p>A:  No, SOLSOL
harnesses solar energy through the use of high efficiency solar cells, so, it
works only when there is sun light. 
Rapid movement in and out of the sun will cause intermittent charging
and could actually reduce your existing batter charge.  Solar energy is clean and renewable.</p>
<p><b>Q:  Does SOLSOL charge a battery charger
(""power bank"")?</b></p>
<p>A:  Yes, SOLSOL can
charge Power Bank devices (spare battery devices), so that you can use your
spare battery device to charge your other tech devices during the day or night.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453778758/wd8kvuj8lmwfdu7t9ifj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>Q:  How long will it take to charge my phone?</b></p>
<p>A:  This depends on
your phone or device.  SOLSOL has a power
output between 125mA - 350mA.  A regular
wall outlet has an output of 1000 mA and a standard laptop has an output of
500mA.  If it takes an hour to charge your
device using a wall outlet, it would take 2 hours using a laptop and 2.7 - 4.0
hours with SOLSOL.  All these times are
assuming you have a battery with 0% charge remaining.  If you have, for instance, 50% charge
remaining, the time to a full charge is much less.  If you have partial battery and are using
your device, you can avoid further battery loss by using your SOLSOL hat.  Remember, you need to be in the sun for
SOLSOL to function properly.</p>
<p><b>Q:  Does SOLSOL have to be worn to charge my
iPhone or android phone?</b></p>
<p>A:  No, you can place
SOLSOL on any flat surface where there is sun light or even snap it behind your
backpack or even on your car's dashboard. 
Note:  heavy window tinting may
prevent your SOLSOL hat from charging while in your car.</p>

<p><b>Q:  Does SOLSOL have warranty?</b></p>
<p>A:  Yes, SOLSOL has a 1-year
manufacturer's parts warranty on our proprietary solar panel and proprietary
LXTSOL USB Outport component.  Warranty
does not cover damages due to wear and tear of the cap or if you damage the
solar panel.  The solar panel is NOT
intended to be bent or curved. 
Attempting to bend it will cause damage and void the warranty.</p>
<p><b>Q:  Is SOLSOL Waterproof?</b></p>
<p>A:  SOLSOL is water
resistant.  As long as SOLSOL is not
submerged in water or any type of liquid it will not get damaged.  It is, actually, just as water resistant as
your phone (unless you have a totally submersible phone).  And, if you are caught in the rain, you might
not be using your SOLSOL since it requires sunlight.  Please, try not to test its resistance to
water.  Please take proper care of this
great product.</p>
<p><b>Q:  Do I need to clean the surface area of the
SOLSOL Panel?</b></p>
<p>A:  It's always
recommended that prior to using SOLSOL that you wipe the surface area of the
panel with a soft dry or damp cloth in case there is some dirt, finger prints,
dust or other material on the panel surface.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454002021/uxsewn6qjfabv1scabpi.png"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p><b>Q:  Does the SOLSOL hat come with a charging
cord?</b></p>
<p>A:  You will provide
your own cord so you can be assured that it is the right one for your personal
device.  Just plug your cord into the USB
port in the side pocket of your hat, plug into your device, get into the sun,
and you're in business.</p>
<p><b>Q:  Does the SOLSOL hat get hot or emit electromagnetic waves?</b><br/></p>
<p>A.  The solar panel will get warm due to its being in the direct sun, just as the hat itself will warm up.  However, it will not become uncomfortable or hurt you.  No magnetic waves or magnetic field is generated.  This would happen when converting Direct Current (DC) to Alternating Current (AC) which does not happen with our hat.  The hat circuitry is strictly very low voltage and DC only.</p>

</div></div>","SOLSOL, Solar hat keeps your smart devices charged up and helps reduce our carbon footprint








SOLSOL is our brand-new solution to an old painful problem: a stylish hat with solar cells that charges your dead smartphone or portable device while in the sun. That simple.
Our SOLSOL hats deliver charging power to your iPhone, iPod,
Android phone and other USB charged devices such as GoPro camera’s and portable
battery chargers. As long as the sun shines, you can charge or maintain the
charge of your mobile tech devices. No batteries are included or needed (except
the battery that is already in your device). Same goes for power cables: you’ll
use your own devices’ cable, to make sure it’s the appropriate one!
The SOLSOL hat is eco-friendly too! It lets you make a small
contribution toward reducing our carbon footprint.  Let natural sunlight and our LXTSOL
proprietary electronic power regulator deliver clean power to your tech
products.
Don’t get stuck without power again! Get a SOLSOL hat today
and be a part of the Solar Power Revolution!
How it Works.






REFERRAL PROGRAM.





THE PROBLEM.
Tired of running for power outlets while enjoying a
beautiful day at the park? Still driving around the block with your car waiting
for your phone to charge up at a record-slow speed? Still sitting on airport
floors hooked to a power outlet to text your goodbyes?

 

We’ve all been there. And we have never been big fans of
power banks. They are cumbersome and bulky, too heavy for the lightweight
backpacker.  In the end, charging all your personal devices adds to your carbon footprint.

THE SOLUTION.
We knew there had to be a better way to power our tech gear.
Harvesting energy directly from the sun was the first part of the solution, the
second part, putting that power and tech into the convenience and style of a
hat.




This way, we keep our head covered from heavy sun rays AND
have an extra power source to charge our portable devices!
SOLSOL hats are that simple. You plug your USB cable at the
back of the hat, wear it, and walk in the sun!



The possibilities are endless. Wear SOLSOL at the beach and get some shade while
you text your friends on your iPhone or read on your iPad.



Bring it to your next camping
trip and recharge your GoPro while shooting alpine landscapes. 



Wear it during your day while you walk at the park, or just
leave it in the sunlight while you comfortably read your kindle in the shade.




THE SOLSOL COLLECTION.
Choose between different colors and patterns. Simply select
your favorite perk and get ready to be one of the very first owners of a SOLSOL
hat!



All of our hats are priced at $69 including taxes and shipping ($20
shipping and handling for orders outside the US). In return for your
contribution, you will be the first to receive SOLSOL at a discounted price
before they are offered online or at retail. 
We will NOT ship any hats to any retail outlet until each pre-order hat
has been shipped to each of you.  Each
SOLSOL unit will include a special embroidery on the back of ""SOLSOL
Revolution"" showing that you helped us launch the SOLSOL Revolution.  This special embroidery is only for your
pre-ordered hats and will NOT be featured on any other production hats.

PERK OFFERS.


SPECIFICATIONS.
SOLSOL powers your device when in direct sunlight.
Charging time when the hat is left in constant sunlight exposure vary
accordingly to the device. This is because battery size differs across devices,
along with how the user is using their device and how many apps are open at the
same time.
Charging time using a SOLSOL hat.
● 
4 X the amount of time it takes your device to charge
from a wall outlet.
● 
2 X the amout of time it takes your device to charge
from a laptop.
Please, remember that when charging your device (smartphones
especially) you have to avoid rapid intermittent sun exposure as this may actually
reduce your battery charge. This happens because the screen can go on and off
and suck up all the battery.
Here below are the
technical specifications of SOLSOL:
● 
Maximum Power at STC (Pmax) - 1.45 W
● 
Optimum Operating Voltage (Vmp) - 5.2V
● 
Optimum Operating Current (Imp) - 125mA - 350mA

<h3><b>The Evolution:</b></h3>
<p>For the past year the VueXL team set out to developed a solution to make mobile entertainment more immersive.</p>
<p>We have spent the last year developing the VX1 and we have gone through countless hours of design, prototyping and testing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1263342/files/20150302181027-Vx1-development-gif2.gif?1425348627"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h3>How the funds will be spent:</h3>
<p><b>55%</b>To purchase foam, plastic parts and hardware needed</p>
<p><b>20% </b>Labor cost to assemble and package the Perks</p>
<p><b>25%</b> on Postage and Shipping Supplies</p>
<p><b>Risks and Challenges:</b></p>
<p>We have taken much effort to minimize risks to our backer by investing more of our time and own funds in getting VX1 ready for you.</p>
<p>1. Tooling, the most expensive part of most hardware projects has already completed and we have a small stock of parts already in hand to jump start production. Our molder is based in the US so more parts can be delivered in matter of weeks instead of months. The dies need to cut the foam housings have already been purchased and are ready for production.</p>
<p>2. Redundancy of hardware suppliers, we have found primary and back up suppliers for just about every component. In most cases we have local supplier within hour drive from our production line and another one ready to step in just in case of shortages.</p>
<p>3. We have had beta testing program in place since December 2014 and in that time we have made refinements to our materials and production processes to ensure you get a product that is already well developed.</p>
<p>Despite those precautions we cannot fully anticipate every possible challenge we may face but we promise if an issue is to occurs, backers will be the first know and we will make every effort to over come the challenge in the fastest way possible.</p>

The VX1 is made with a comfortable soft foam housing that allows it to be custom fit to you.  Also we made sure the VX1 is friendly to eye glasses wearers. 

The optional privacy panels blocks out ambient light and prying eyes so you can comfortably escape in your own personal theater.






Early Backers Get the BEST PRICE & Quick Delivery
 Backers Perks & Add Ons:

DESIGNED & ASSEMBLED IN THE USA
It was very important to us to build relationships with US based suppliers and mfg. to make sure the VX1 was made with quality components and fair labor practices. Importing certain components was only consider if no suitable US supplier was found.

Sourcing as much as possible close to home also means we begin shipping your perks sooner and reduces our products carbon foot print compared to importing from overseas.

The Evolution:
For the past year the VueXL team set out to developed a solution to make mobile entertainment more immersive.
We have spent the last year developing the VX1 and we have gone through countless hours of design, prototyping and testing.

How the funds will be spent:
55%To purchase foam, plastic parts and hardware needed
20% Labor cost to assemble and package the Perks
25% on Postage and Shipping Supplies
Risks and Challenges:
We have taken much effort to minimize risks to our backer by investing more of our time and own funds in getting VX1 ready for you.
1. Tooling, the most expensive part of most hardware projects has already completed and we have a small stock of parts already in hand to jump start production. Our molder is based in the US so more parts can be delivered in matter of weeks instead of months. The dies need to cut the foam housings have already been purchased and are ready for production.
2. Redundancy of hardware suppliers, we have found primary and back up suppliers for just about every component. In most cases we have local supplier within hour drive from our production line and another one ready to step in just in case of shortages.
3. We have had beta testing program in place since December 2014 and in that time we have made refinements to our materials and production processes to ensure you get a product that is already well developed.
Despite those precautions we cannot fully anticipate every possible challenge we may face but we promise if an issue is to occurs, backers will be the first know and we will make every effort to over come the challenge in the fastest way possible.

come to expect that we will lose our chargers to friends, siblings, 
children, colleagues, etc. <br/><br/>RABBITcharger is the first charger that 
secures to any standard duplex outlet, has a retractable charging cable 
that gets rid of clutter, and has swappable charging tips for Android 
and iOS devices. Better still, it can simultaneously charge two devices 
with one cable while delivering up to <b><i>2</i><i>.4 amps to each charging tip</i></b>.

chargers should be as inspired as the devices that they charge and that 
charging should be easy and reliable. That is why we created 
RABBITcharger. We have grown accustomed to losing messy charging cables and have 
come to expect that we will lose our chargers to friends, siblings, 
children, colleagues, etc. RABBITcharger is the first charger that 
secures to any standard duplex outlet, has a retractable charging cable 
that gets rid of clutter, and has swappable charging tips for Android 
and iOS devices. Better still, it can simultaneously charge two devices 
with one cable while delivering up to 2.4 amps to each charging tip. 
That's plenty of power for even the biggest phones and tablets! 








Patent-pending RABBITcharger eliminates forever the 
question of who took your charger or where you left it last. Since 
RABBITcharger is an all-in-one charging station that secures to any 
standard duplex outlet, there is no more carrying around charging cables
 or adapters or wondering where you left them. Once you install your 
RABBITcharger, you will have everything you need, when you need it. And 
there is no clutter with RABBITcharger's retractable cable! RABBITcharger Overview: 


Installs in seconds to any standard duplex outlet
Retractable 28"" charging cable
Dual micro-USB charging tips and (2) swappable iOS-compatible charging tips capable of delivering up to 2.4 amps to each charging tip.

LED perimeter light indicates when RABBITcharger is charging a device.





 
INSTALLATION 
Not only did we want RABBITcharger to be 
convenient and easy to use, but it also had to be safe, quick, and 
simple to install. There is no electrical expertise required to install 
RABBITcharger.  It only takes 15 seconds to install!First, remove the cover plate screw from your standard duplex outlet 
while leaving the cover plate in place.  Then, plug in RABBITcharger, 
install its screw, and snap on the RABBITcharger cover plate.  Now, 
you're ready to start charging your devices! 
Whether you have a horizontal or vertical outlet, whether the ground 
is up or down on your outlet, RABBITcharger installs into any standard 
duplex outlet no matter its orientation. 










 
What type of outlets can be used with RABBITcharger?

RABBITcharger is compatible with any standard duplex outlet. While 
we will be expanding the range of outlets into which RABBITcharger can 
be installed, the current model is not compatible with decor or 
Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) outlets.  In short, if your 
outlet looks like this one, then your house is ready for RABBITchargers.
 





RABBITchargers are compatible with standard duplex outlets - like this one.

PARTS TESTING 
In order to ensure that we would be using the highest quality 
parts and slimmest cables available, we conducted tests on dozens of 
cables. Our cables need to withstand a number of retractions, and the 
slimmest cables allow RABBITcharger to extend as far as possible without
 creating a bulky device. 




We tested cables to ensure the highest quality product.


The cable that won was a cable that withstood over 15,000 retraction cycles before we stopped the test!  It didn't ever fail or break during testing; we just had to move on to other tasks!PROTOTYPING

After completing our engineering and design work, we started 
prototyping to ensure that the look, feel, and function of RABBITcharger
 reflected our demanding vision.  After a few tweaks and a few 
prototypes, we are ready to start manufacturing.MANUFACTURINGTo ensure that we could move 
seamlessly into manufacturing, we already released Tooling, which is essentially the construction of the molds for each of the parts and pieces that go into RABBITcharger.  You won't be waiting around long to receive your RABBITcharger!Even

<br/><p>RedBlue module is a multi-purpose &amp; versatile Bluetooth 4.0 LE turnkey solution. When we develop the RedBlue series, we wanted more people to unleash their creativity and speed up BLE product development by making the RedBlue modules as versatile as possible and, most importantly, eliminating the biggest barrier to most people - MCU programming! <br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>16 Simple-to-Use, Multi-Purpose Control &amp; Sensing I/Os
                </b></p>
<p>Each RedBlue module has 
combination of 16 multi-purpose I/Os that bound to cover most common 
applications like, triggering switches/buttons, buzzers, LEDs; varying 
motor speed, dimming LED; detecting manual or sensor switches; measuring
 voltage levels of analog sensors like potentiometer, photo sensors, 
analog accelerometers, thermo sensors; controlling up to 8 RC/robotic 
servos to perform complicated motions, just to name a few. 
                
                And above all, all 16 input/output channels works right away without a single line of programming. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Two Versions - RedBlue 902 &amp; RedBlue 904
                </b></p>
<p>Our RedBlue 900 series currently has two versions: RedBlue 902 &amp; RedBlue 904. RedBlue 902 has more general purpose I/Os than RedBlue 904. RedBlue 904 is more robotic oriented because it has 8 servo channels. </p>
<p><span>So
 if you have more sensors to monitor, have to trigger / control more 
switches/buttons, need more PWM channels to regulate current (e.g. LED 
dimming / motor speed control), then RedBlue 902
 should be the best option. But if your project is robotic or RC model 
control, you will likely need to control servos or electronic speed 
controller (ESC), then RedBlue 904 is the Best choice for your.</span></p>

<p>The RedBlue module consumes very little power and accept 3V to 5V input voltage. This makes the module ready for a variety of power sources such as:
                
                </p>
<ul>
<li>Single coin cell (e.g. 2032, 2025)</li>
<li>Single Li-Po battery</li>
<li>3-4 NiMH/NiCd rechargeable batteries</li>
<li>2-3 AAA or other 1.5V batteries</li>
<li>USB power supply/adaptor</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Small &amp; Light Weight</h3> <p>The RedBlue module measures only 23.9 x 35mm (0.95 x 1.4inches) and weights only 3.3g (0.12 oz). </p>
<ul>
<li>Dimensions: 23.9mm x 35mm (0.95” x 1.35”)<br/>
</li>
<li>Weight: 3.3g (0.12 oz)<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Together with it’s low power and low voltage requirements, you can build
 very light weight &amp; compact Bluetooth LE controlled gadgets, robots
 or even flying models. Or you can also easily embed the RedBlue module 
inside most existing products like home appliances, power sockets, lamps
 and toys, etc.<br/></p>

<p><b>Multiple Interface for Different Purposes
                </b></p>
<p>The free RedBlue App has a “Full Control Interface” for each RedBlue model which allows you to control and monitor everything connected to your RedBlue 900
 modules WITHOUT any programming. Apart from the general purpose “Full Control Interface”, we 
are also implementing customized control interfaces for some common but 
specific applications. For example, there will be X-Y control interface 
for applications like RC car control. </p>

<div>Using RedBlue for your innovation is far much easier than using Arduino vs Raspberry Pi in most applications</div>
<br/><h3>Easy-Connection Kit</h3> <p>While you can wire your I/Os and sensors directly to the RedBlue module for compactness. We understand that connection flexibility is the key to speed up your product development &amp; testing stages. That’s why each RedBlue module comes with a dedicated extension board and cables for quick &amp; easy connection. The extension board interfaces every I/Os into industry standard 2.00mm pitch pin sockets. Soldering is virtually not required while you do your testing.</p>

<br/><h3>FAQ</h3> <p><b>1. Why is it called RedBlue?</b><br/>It’s boring to see almost every Bluetooth related items in blue. So we simply add the “counterpart” color red.<br/><br/><b>2. Why did you make the RedBlue module?</b><br/>After working in the mobile App, educational and engineering industries for years, we found that many people, even young students, have had some great innovative ideas in mind that can utilize the low power, low cost, compact BLE technology and the high penetration of smartphones. They usually have the required skill to build their own electronics or even coding Apps. What they lack is a ready to use wireless foundation for them to build upon. The mission of our RedBlue project was trying to remove the most technically demanding barrier - the wireless linkage between your smartphone &amp; DIY gadgets. <br/><br/><b>3. Which RedBlue Model should I choose?</b><br/>If you are not sure which RedBlue module to get, then ask yourself any of the following simple questions: <br/><br/>i) Do you need servo control? <br/>If not, then go for RedBlue 902. Otherwise, go for 904. <br/><br/>ii) Are you planing to start a robotic project?<br/>If so, you’ll likely need servo control. Thus go for RedBlue 904.<br/><br/>iii) Are you going to start a home automation type project? <br/>If so, you might want to get the RedBlue 902 module. 902 has more sensor inputs and switch controls for you to turn lights or other devices on/off.<br/><br/><b>4. What is the current status of the ready-to-use RedBlue Control App?</b><br/>The latest RedBlue Control App is currently fully working as seen on the video and we are almost ready to submit the App to the App Store. The only uncertainty that may delay the release of the RedBlue Control App is the App Store review process. But since we have already had experience in successfully publishing nearly 100 Apps, including BLE related Apps for our customers, we don’t expect there will be significant issue. And the sample code we will provide to our backers will always be an instant backup for App developers.<br/><br/><b>5. What is the current status of the RedBlue Module?</b><br/>We have already had working pre-production RedBlue hardware modules on hand. As seen on the video. So there should be no problem on the module production process. However, since we are not sure at this stage how many units we need to produce, component sourcing lead time could be the main possible risk that may delay the RedBlue module delivery. We shall be able to project a more concrete sourcing lead time near the end of this campaign. <br/><br/><b>6. Other question?</b><br/>Please contact us at support@kratos-digital.com</p>

*** NEWS UPDATE ***New Video Demo on YouTube: Integrating RedBlue into standard robotic arm in just 3 mins!
Watch our new video demo: https://youtu.be/AW0n3y1QYL8How to turn a standard robotic arm into a smartphone controlled robotic arm in 3 mins. Using an iPhone to control a robotic arm wireless with the RedBlue BLE Bluetooth module! *********************
The Simplest Multi-Functional BLE Turnkey Solution for Everyone


RedBlue module is a multi-purpose & versatile Bluetooth 4.0 LE turnkey solution. When we develop the RedBlue series, we wanted more people to unleash their creativity and speed up BLE product development by making the RedBlue modules as versatile as possible and, most importantly, eliminating the biggest barrier to most people - MCU programming! 


The Missing Link Between Your Smartphone & External Electronic Components 



16 Simple-to-Use, Multi-Purpose Control & Sensing I/Os
                
Each RedBlue module has 
combination of 16 multi-purpose I/Os that bound to cover most common 
applications like, triggering switches/buttons, buzzers, LEDs; varying 
motor speed, dimming LED; detecting manual or sensor switches; measuring
 voltage levels of analog sensors like potentiometer, photo sensors, 
analog accelerometers, thermo sensors; controlling up to 8 RC/robotic 
servos to perform complicated motions, just to name a few. 
                
                And above all, all 16 input/output channels works right away without a single line of programming. 

Two Versions - RedBlue 902 & RedBlue 904
                
Our RedBlue 900 series currently has two versions: RedBlue 902 & RedBlue 904. RedBlue 902 has more general purpose I/Os than RedBlue 904. RedBlue 904 is more robotic oriented because it has 8 servo channels. 
So
 if you have more sensors to monitor, have to trigger / control more 
switches/buttons, need more PWM channels to regulate current (e.g. LED 
dimming / motor speed control), then RedBlue 902
 should be the best option. But if your project is robotic or RC model 
control, you will likely need to control servos or electronic speed 
controller (ESC), then RedBlue 904 is the Best choice for your.


Accepts a Variety of Battery or Power Source for Wider Applications 


The RedBlue module consumes very little power and accept 3V to 5V input voltage. This makes the module ready for a variety of power sources such as:
                
                

Single coin cell (e.g. 2032, 2025)
Single Li-Po battery
3-4 NiMH/NiCd rechargeable batteries
2-3 AAA or other 1.5V batteries
USB power supply/adaptor




Small & Light Weight The RedBlue module measures only 23.9 x 35mm (0.95 x 1.4inches) and weights only 3.3g (0.12 oz). 

Dimensions: 23.9mm x 35mm (0.95” x 1.35”)

Weight: 3.3g (0.12 oz)


Together with it’s low power and low voltage requirements, you can build
 very light weight & compact Bluetooth LE controlled gadgets, robots
 or even flying models. Or you can also easily embed the RedBlue module 
inside most existing products like home appliances, power sockets, lamps
 and toys, etc.

*Free RedBlue App to Control & Monitor Everything Connected  






Multiple Interface for Different Purposes
                
The free RedBlue App has a “Full Control Interface” for each RedBlue model which allows you to control and monitor everything connected to your RedBlue 900
 modules WITHOUT any programming. Apart from the general purpose “Full Control Interface”, we 
are also implementing customized control interfaces for some common but 
specific applications. For example, there will be X-Y control interface 
for applications like RC car control. 





Using RedBlue for your innovation is far much easier than using Arduino vs Raspberry Pi in most applications
Easy-Connection Kit While you can wire your I/Os and sensors directly to the RedBlue module for compactness. We understand that connection flexibility is the key to speed up your product development & testing stages. That’s why each RedBlue module comes with a dedicated extension board and cables for quick & easy connection. The extension board interfaces every I/Os into industry standard 2.00mm pitch pin sockets. Soldering is virtually not required while you do your testing.



RedBlue Library for App Developers If you know mobile App development, you can implement more advanced AI or complicated algorithms/calculations as if all those sensor/switch inputs and servo, motor, LED outputs etc are connected directly to your smartphone! Imagine you can also put your smartphone right on you robots & gadgets, utilize your smartphone’s built-in features like compass, camera face detection, motion sensors, GPS and desktop class processing power to auto-guide & control your RedBlue module outputs accordingly.English Like Library Functions - No Low Level ProgrammingWe have been working hard to make the RedBlue library (currently iOS version only, Android version will come later) as developer friendly as possible. You can actually control the RedBlue module with English like functions such as
[myRedBlueController turnOnSwitch1For902];or[myRedBlueController setPWM2DutyCycleFor902To:50];Our RedBlue library handle all those “non-sense” low level hex, UUID, data conversion for you. This allows you to concentrate on implementing your unique features rather than dealing with those trivial I/O controls.Open Source Sample CodeFully functional Open Source sample codes and full projects will be available to drastically speed up your own App development!Get Yourself Ready. Turn Your Great BLE 4.0 Project Concept into Reality - for your Own Crowdfunding and Changing the World There are endless possibilities when you combine the wireless flexibility, low power consumption of Bluetooth 4.0 LE with the high penetration rate of powerful smartphones.  Your great ideas might turn into the next big Indigogo crowdfunding campaign and change the world. However, great idea comes and goes if you’re not ready to realize it & grasp it. That’s why you need the most ready-to-use BLE module like the RedBlue module which significantly reduce your preparation barrier and effort so that you can instantly focus on implementing the innovative part of your project concepts!

FAQ 1. Why is it called RedBlue?It’s boring to see almost every Bluetooth related items in blue. So we simply add the “counterpart” color red.2. Why did you make the RedBlue module?After working in the mobile App, educational and engineering industries for years, we found that many people, even young students, have had some great innovative ideas in mind that can utilize the low power, low cost, compact BLE technology and the high penetration of smartphones. They usually have the required skill to build their own electronics or even coding Apps. What they lack is a ready to use wireless foundation for them to build upon. The mission of our RedBlue project was trying to remove the most technically demanding barrier - the wireless linkage between your smartphone & DIY gadgets. 3. Which RedBlue Model should I choose?If you are not sure which RedBlue module to get, then ask yourself any of the following simple questions: i) Do you need servo control? If not, then go for RedBlue 902. Otherwise, go for 904. ii) Are you planing to start a robotic project?If so, you’ll likely need servo control. Thus go for RedBlue 904.iii) Are you going to start a home automation type project? If so, you might want to get the RedBlue 902 module. 902 has more sensor inputs and switch controls for you to turn lights or other devices on/off.4. What is the current status of the ready-to-use RedBlue Control App?The latest RedBlue Control App is currently fully working as seen on the video and we are almost ready to submit the App to the App Store. The only uncertainty that may delay the release of the RedBlue Control App is the App Store review process. But since we have already had experience in successfully publishing nearly 100 Apps, including BLE related Apps for our customers, we don’t expect there will be significant issue. And the sample code we will provide to our backers will always be an instant backup for App developers.5. What is the current status of the RedBlue Module?We have already had working pre-production RedBlue hardware modules on hand. As seen on the video. So there should be no problem on the module production process. However, since we are not sure at this stage how many units we need to produce, component sourcing lead time could be the main possible risk that may delay the RedBlue module delivery. We shall be able to project a more concrete sourcing lead time near the end of this campaign. 6. Other question?Please contact us at support@kratos-digital.com

The RedBlue project team is a 2 brother team, YL & YK. 

Though respectively holding a PhD and MPhil degree, the 2 brothers had the tradition of bringing sophisticated technologies “down to earth” for more people to enjoy.
Apps created by the 2 brother team have already been enjoyed by over a million users.
For example, this team is the creator behind few iOS Apps that achieved remarkable international success, including:


   
- Glow Doodle :  Achieved 5th Top Paid position in both US & UK App Store as early as 2010. This app allows everyone including kids & adults to doodle with razor sharp neon glowing effect. Before that, such visual effect could only be done by professional graphics designers. The App is widely used in elementary & pre-schools. 
- G FORCE : Sophisticated one-touch g-sensor calibration made possible by clever implementation of engineering know hows. Turns every iPhone into a vehicle g meter which, according to our professional user feedback, is as accurate as a $3,000 professional equipment yet with less setup hassle

Other Apps including the first ever action recognition game released on the grand opening of Apple App Store. The game is also the first to allow high score players to ""sign"" their name with finger instead of typing, Free hand sketched stickman recognition and completely free hand sketched TicTacToe AI App. 

Making Professional Hobby a Toy for Everyone to Enjoy
YL was also the aero engineering professional among the team who made the first “toy grade” all terrine RC flyer, Air Hogs StormLauncher, possible. Before that, all terrine RC flyer were only for advanced hobbyists. 
In the Crowdfunding World
Actually, RedBlue was also the breeding seed for one of the successfully crowdfunded smart cups. RedBlue greatly reduced the turnaround time for the proof-of-concept prototype development of the App connected smart cup.

<h3><b>Let’s talk about plants</b></h3>
<p>Did you know the best way to water plants is keeping the soil moist?</p>
<p>Did you know the worst way to water the plant is pouring the plant with
water?</p>
<p>Did you know that sunshine destroys the plant because of it’s microscopic
trait of water drops poured on the plant?</p>
<p>About 40% of the poured water vaporizes. Instead, if we keep the soil near
the root moist, less water will be used and also the plant will not be exposed
to being destroyed by life giving sunshine.</p>
<p>This is exactly what S.Pot will accomplish for you.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Abilities of S.Pot</b></h3>
<p>The most important mission of S.Pot, is caring for your beloved flower and
plant. Because of watering from below, there will be no waste of water, and if
produced in other versions, there will be no need for sunshine either.</p>
<p>In the next versions of S.Pot, in addition to soil moist, soil temperature
and needed light to grow, will be set and controlled.</p><p><br/></p>

<h3><b>Design of body</b></h3>
<p>S.Pot body is designed by professional designing software, and every detail

<h3><b>Electronic design</b></h3>
<p>In designing and manufacturing electronic parts, we tried to consider every

<h3><b>Concept &amp; Design</b></h3>
</div><div>
<p>The idea behind LifeDock is to simply combine function and
form. The minimalist charging stations on the market are very minimal but the usefulness stops there. We want a charging station that does more.
Since having plants around provides so many benefits, combining the two made
absolute sense.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437963283/c7v7bkmj0anxyeuedis1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p>Our very first prototype is a bit bigger. In order to save space, we redesigned it into a slimmer version.  </p>

<p><b>Design Revisions</b></p>
<p>Our goal is to bring LifeDock into life (see what I did there?) at a reasonable price, but without compromising quality.  In May to June, we have met and spoken with quite a few manufacturers. All of them indicated that this particular design will be difficult to make. The trapezoid container poses the most complications. Thus we had to make revisions to make the whole design more rectangular instead of trapezoidal. The final product would look more like the pictures in ""Features &amp; Materials"".<br/></p>

<p>LifeDock's base will be created from our aluminum die-casting mold, and then undergo CNC porcessing to acheieve a smooth finish. The container will be made of glass and the clear walls acrylic. </p>
<p>Besides charging, the main feature of LifeDock is the container for plant
placement. Aside from that, LifeDock’s first clear wall acts as backrest to support the smart devices. Two clear pads of different thickness will also be provided to ensure that your device can rest comfortably on the clear wall, whether you use a case or not. </p>
<p>The two clear walls allow unobstructed view of the plants, letting
you admire their beauty from all angles. The open design, in the sense that
it’s not enclosed, facilitates easy removal of the container, enabling you to
interchange one for another. (Alternating containers with different plants in
it is recommended, since plants need to get enough sunlight and be watered as
well!) </p>

<p>Two pieces of “sticky pads” will go on bottom of the docking

<h3><b>How the money will be used</b></h3>
<p>Up to now we have spent more than $4,000 making the prototypes and procuring various materials. With your support we can make LifeDock a reality. A great percentage, about 60%, of the goal will be used to pay for the molds that will be used to create LifeDock. The rest of the money will be used to cover other expenses, such as production costs, material costs, and packaging costs. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Fulfillment </b></h3>
<p><b>Manufacturing:</b> We are based in Taiwan, thus we looked for manufacturers that are in Taiwan as well. It would be easier for us to communicate with them, as well as supervise the process to ensure that we are satisfied with the end result. We will be working with a die casting mold manufacturer that has extensive experience and been making products for many internationally well known brands with a wide assortment of products. We have personally visited their factory and inspected the products they made and are positive they can deliver excellent end product. </p>
<p><b>Plants:</b> Air plants will be supplied by The Air Plant Shop (<a href=""http://www.airplantshop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.airplantshop.com</a>) and succulents by The Succulent Source (<a href=""http://www.thesucculentsource.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thesucculentsource.com</a>). Once LifeDock is ready to ship we will coordinate with the plant suppliers so that hopefully you will receive LifeDock and the plants around the same time!</p>
<p><b>Assembly, Packaging &amp; Logistics:</b> The products will be assembled by the manufacturer but packaged by our team. In the process, we will inspect each and every one of the products to ensure that they are all good to go! We will also handle the logistics ourselves as well. Once the LifeDocks are packaged, they will be shipped out via Taiwan Post Office and individual tracking number will be provided to all backers.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">                       </span></p>

The Story behind LifeDockPause for a moment and take a look around. Whether you are at work or at home, you are probably surrounded by lifeless inanimate objects. It does not have to be that way! What’s missing is the presence of green luscious plants. Since smart devices have become indispensable from our lives, combining plants with the charging station is the perfect solution. Let LifeDock bring a breath of fresh air into your lives! 
Why plants?

According to some researches, having indoor plants provides
numerous benefits. Plants can:


Beautify the indoor space
Enhance physical and mental health
Eliminate harmful toxins from the air
Reduce stress and relief eye strain
Boost creativity and sharpen focus
Provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction through the process of cultivating plants







Decorate your home or office with different plants. Whenever you take out a plant container to water it and give it sunlight, you can place another container with a different plant. Your space never has to look the same again!



LifeDock in 6 sentences:


You will always have the benefits of plants

Home/office will never look the same! Interchange plant containers as often as you want, based on either your mood or the seasonality!

Smart phones/devices will always be fully charged
One hand removal of device
No screws, no fuss!
Elegant and space saving, looks great even without the phone!






Concept & Design

The idea behind LifeDock is to simply combine function and
form. The minimalist charging stations on the market are very minimal but the usefulness stops there. We want a charging station that does more.
Since having plants around provides so many benefits, combining the two made
absolute sense.




Our very first prototype is a bit bigger. In order to save space, we redesigned it into a slimmer version.  
First Prototype with iPhone 6:



Second Prototype with iPhone 6:






Design Revisions
Our goal is to bring LifeDock into life (see what I did there?) at a reasonable price, but without compromising quality.  In May to June, we have met and spoken with quite a few manufacturers. All of them indicated that this particular design will be difficult to make. The trapezoid container poses the most complications. Thus we had to make revisions to make the whole design more rectangular instead of trapezoidal. The final product would look more like the pictures in ""Features & Materials"".




Features & Materials

 




LifeDock's base will be created from our aluminum die-casting mold, and then undergo CNC porcessing to acheieve a smooth finish. The container will be made of glass and the clear walls acrylic. 
Besides charging, the main feature of LifeDock is the container for plant
placement. Aside from that, LifeDock’s first clear wall acts as backrest to support the smart devices. Two clear pads of different thickness will also be provided to ensure that your device can rest comfortably on the clear wall, whether you use a case or not. 
The two clear walls allow unobstructed view of the plants, letting
you admire their beauty from all angles. The open design, in the sense that
it’s not enclosed, facilitates easy removal of the container, enabling you to
interchange one for another. (Alternating containers with different plants in
it is recommended, since plants need to get enough sunlight and be watered as
well!) 



Two pieces of “sticky pads” will go on bottom of the docking
station. We chose to use sticky pads to allow one hand removal of the phone.
The sticky pads can be wiped with a wet cloth to restore its stickiness.
The following have been tested: 


Apple: iPhone 5, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus
Android: LG G3, LG G4, Samsung S6 Edge, Samsung S6, Samsung A7, Samsung E7, Samsung E5, Asus Zenfone 2, HTC Butterfly
Tablets: iPad Air, iPad mini

We tested LifeDock with an iPhone 6 Plus that uses
the Spigen Tough Armor protective case as well. If your case is
similar to the Spigen Tough Armor case or something slimmer, it will work with
the LifeDock!

What's included with each LifeDock unit?
Each LifeDock comes with one container, one adapter designed for Apple Lightning USB cable, two clear pads(for wall), and two sticky pads(for bottom). (The Apple Lightning USB cable is not included.)  
The Android adapter and micro USB cable will be included with all LifeDocks once the stretch goal is met.






Available Colors:





                                                                  Arctic Silver                                                              Stealth Black                                     Blazing Gold (Available once Stretch Goal met)


Perks & Plants:
















*Sora Edge Workshop - In the initial Skype session you can tell us about the idea you have in mind. We will then work on the sketches and show them to you . Give us your feedback and we will make the necessary changes. (There would be a total of two revision rounds.) The end result will be solely yours and you can take it to the next stage!

</div></div>","Hi I'm Khalid Gindeel
I'm the director of the International Nuba Mountain Association in Cairo, a community organization doing activism  among the Nuba refugees here in Cairo.
 If you don't know anything about the Nuba mountain people from Sudan, its okay. Most people don't, which is why we're starting our campaign to pay for a lap top  and internet services for our outreach, community organizing, and getting the first Nuba refugee news paper off the ground here in Cairo.
So a little bit about where we're from: we're facing genocide back home in Nuba mountain region of South Kordofan, Sudan. 
Omar Bashir, The President of Sudan who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for his crimes against humanity in Darfur, has ordered his air force to bomb our homes and burned crops. Fighters under him have committed rape and indiscriminate killings of women and children.  
1) We want the General Secretary of the United Nations to visit Nuba and we want the genocide to stop. 
2) We fled the genocide and war only to come across discrimination low wages and racially motivated violence here in Cairo. Here in Cairo, we’ve been illegally evicted from our homes. Women have been raped. Police brutality is a huge problem for us here in Egypt. 

Presently Egypt hosts over 30,000 Sudanese refugees. Some of us are here alone. Some of us are here with family. All of us are trying to survive. 
We want the world to know what’s happening with the Ethnic cleansing in South Kordofan and our trials here.
 You  can help us do that.   Lap top costs $500. Internet costs $500 for a year here in Cairo.We’re not asking for a fortune, but that for most refugees here in Egypt that money is a fortune.
