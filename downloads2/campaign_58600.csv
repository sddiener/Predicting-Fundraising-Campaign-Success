<h3>Unsere Vision -</h3>
<p><b>Leistungssteigerung auf natürliche und gesunde Weise. </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Kranke Gesellschaft</b></p>
<p>Zu den Krankheiten unserer Zivilisation  -viele davon Ergebnisse der unerbittlichen Leistungsdruckgesellschaft und der zunehmend schlechter werdenden Umweltbedingungen -  zählen neben Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen, Diabetes und Bluthochdruck vor allem auch Burn-out und Depressionen. Wer das Glück hat, sich in München im Burn-out-Diagnostik-Institut behandeln lassen zu können, erhält den kostbaren Vorzug einer individuellen Therapie. Diese umfasst neben den schulmedizinischen Ansätzen auch alternativmedizinische Wege, wie z.B. den der mitochondrialen Medizin.</p>
<p><b>Gesundheit fördern</b></p>
<p>Zwei der führenden Mitochondrien-Spezialisten aus Deutschland behandeln ihre Patienten nachhaltig: Mit hochwirksamen Naturstoffprodukten werden die Mitochondrien gezielt aufgebaut. Ganz ohne Chemie und ohne künstliche Stoffe, die der Körper nicht verarbeiten kann. So werden die Beschwerden an der Wurzel gepackt.</p>
<p>Viele Patienten bestätigen eine Verbesserung ihres individuellen Wohlbefindens innerhalb kürzester Zeit. Da werden die labortechnischen Belege der Genesung beinahe nebensächlich. </p>
<p><b>Innovative Idee</b></p>
<p>Doch warum die Menschen erst behandeln, wenn sie krank sind? Viel besser ist es doch, vorhandene Leistungsfähigkeit und Gesundheit auszubauen. </p>
<p>Wie? Klar, in dem die Menschen ihre Mitochondrien stärken. Auf natürliche Weise und natürlichem Weg: Über ein naturstoffliches Getränk.</p>

<p style=""display: inline !important;"">Den
Schlüssel zu Gesundheit, Jugend &amp; Leitungsfähigkeit trägst Du in Dir, in
jeder Deiner Zellen: Deine Mitochondrien. Mitochondrien sind die
Energie-Kraftwerke der Zellen. In jeder menschlichen Zelle befinden
sich zwischen 500 bis 5000 Mitochondrien. Sie bilden den Energiestoff ATP
(Adenosintriphosphat), der für den gesamten Stoffwechsel der Zellen notwendig
ist. ATP entsteht - vereinfacht ausgedrückt - wenn in den Zellen<span> Glukose mit Sauerstoff oxidiert (oxidative
Phosphorylierung), also ""verbrannt"" wird. Die Verbrennung setzt
Energie frei und wird zu ATP verstoffwechselt. ATP transportiert die Energie
dann dorthin, wo sie benötigt wird. Und das nicht nur für physische
Funktionen. Auch das Nervenkostüm, die Verdauung, die Neubildung von Haaren und
Haut benötigt dieses ATP.</span></p>

<p><i><span> ATP-Produktion</span></i></p>
<p><span>Somit
logisch: Die leistungsfähigen Zellkraftwerke (Mitochondrien) produzieren das

<h2>Wir stehen dahinter</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Leben und Gesundheit bedeutet in Einklang mit den Naturgesetzen zu leben. Dies wird in unserer aktuellen, hektischen Zivilisationsgesellschaft häufig vergessen. Künstlich hergestellte Lebensmittel, synthetische Medikamente und unnatürliche Aromastoffe sowie Konservierungsmittel sind mit gesunder Lebensweise nicht zu vereinbaren.  Diese bringen immer seltener ausschließlich Nutzen, sondern rufen immer häufiger erheblichen Schaden im menschlichen Organismus hervor.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Die MITO Group beschäftigt sich seit Jahren mit der Thematik ""Gesundheit und Leistungsfähigkeit"". Hier wurden ein neu- &amp; einzigartiges Konzept sowie eigene hochwirksame Naturstoffprodukte für die Gesamtheit der Mitochondrien entwickelt. Die Philosophie hinter der MITOcare Produktreihe lautet ""Zurückkehren zu uralten Naturgesetzen."" MITOcare Produkte enthalten ausschließlich bioidentische Naturstoffe ohne synthetische oder künstliche Zusätze. Dabei verwendet MITOcare keine hochdosierten Einzelstoffe, sondern niedrig dosierte Komplexmischungen, wie sie in der Natur vorkommen.</p>
<p>Aufgrund der Erfahrungen und Entwicklungen von Präparaten für die mitochondriale Medizin, wurde die MITO GROUP von Beginn an in die Entwicklung des ""Mitochondrien  - aktivierende Wirkstoffkomplex"" und den daraus resultierenden MITO einbezogen.</p>
<p>Wir werden weiter daran arbeiten, unsere Vision Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3><b>Our vision -</b></h3>
<p><b>Enhancing your performance – naturally and healthily</b></p>
<p><b>An ailing society</b></p>
<p>Among the many illnesses our society helps to cause –
many of them due to the relentless pressure to perform and the increasing
degradation of the environment – are cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and high
blood pressure, to name just three. But chief among them are burn-out and
depression. Anyone being treated at Munich's Burn-Out Diagnostic Institute will
have the great advantage of receiving an individualised treatment programme
that includes not just conventional medicine but also alternative therapies
such as those based on mitochondrial medicine. </p>
<p><b>Promoting health</b></p>
<p>At the Institute, two of Germany's leading mitochondria
specialists treat their patients for the long term. Highly effective natural
products are used to target and build up the cells' mitochondria. No chemicals
or other artificial agents are used, as the body cannot process them. In this
way, we address the root cause of the difficulties. </p>
<p>Many patients report feeling better very quickly. Next
to that, the actual clinical proof of their recovery is almost of secondary
importance. </p>
<p><b>An innovative idea</b></p>
<p>Why wait until people get ill to treat them? Surely it
is far preferable to build up the health and performance levels they already
have.</p>
<p>How? By strengthening their mitochondria. Naturally –
with a drink made from natural ingredients.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1387404/files/20150415233339-hintergrund_Vision__startseite.jpg?1429166019"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>A formula that can be bottled</b></p>
<p>Our
mission is to develop a 'mitochondria-activating formula for a new generation
of drinks'. </p>
<p>Step
one. In 2012, doctors and specialists at the Burn-Out Diagnostic Institute
contacted prominent figures from the world of molecular biology and immediately
won them over to the idea. A task force was put together. Its aim? To increase
the cellular performance of people everywhere. </p>
<p>Step
two: In 2013, intensive research and development began, accompanied, supported
and borne out by numerous studies. Then, a milestone: the successful extraction
of the mitochondria-activating agent. </p>
<p>Step
three: in 2014, the concept and formulation of the drink began under strict
conditions. Then, at the end of 2014, the breakthrough. The formula of active
ingredients could finally be manufactured as a drink – MITO – using a carefully
calibrated mixture of 100% natural and high-quality ingredients.</p>
<p>Step
four. Today the manufacture and marketing of MITO, the drink that promotes both
health and performance, is ready to roll. But manufacture and PR are expensive
and development costs have been high. So then came the idea. Why not let MITO,
the drink that can benefit everyone, be funded by everyone? In other words, by
crowdfunding.</p>
<p>Step
five: tomorrow. The first 250,000 bottles are coming off the production line.
Our marketing and PR campaign is explaining the benefits of MITO to everyone.
MITO has had a positive effect on your life. Thank you.</p>

<h2>
<b>Your mitochondria
–<br/></b><b>The
key to better health, feeling younger performing better. </b>
</h2>
<p>The key to better health, feeling
younger and performing better lies within you in each and every one of your
cells. In your mitochondria. Mitochondria are the cell's powerhouse. Every
human cell contains somewhere between 500 and 5,000 mitochondria. The
mitochondria build the energy-bearing molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is needed by the cell's entire metabolism. Put simply,
ATP is produced when glucose is oxidised, or 'burned' (a process known as oxidative phosphorylation). This combustion releases energy and
is metabolised into ATP. The ATP than transports the energy to where it is
needed. And not just for physical functions. The nervous and digestive systems
and the build-up of new hair and skin all require ATP.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1418393/files/20150427052834-ATP-Grafik_mitochcondrium_.jpg?1430137714"" src="""" style=""""/></p>ATP production

<p>So as you can see, the cellular powerhouses
represented by the mitochondria produce the ATP that is needed buy your entire
body. Or put another way, if as a result of mitochondrial defect insufficient
energy is produced, then the body will not function properly. It's like grit
getting into a machine. Over time, it can cause significant damage.</p>
<p>But you can stop this happening. The mitochondrial
performance of your cells determines your individual performance. So give your
cells a boost – and stay healthy. </p>

<b>A
revolutionary innovation –<br/></b><b>
MITO - 'the iPhone of performance drinks'</b>
</h2>
<p>Portable phones have existed since about 1985. In 1992
they crossed over into the mass market. But it wasn't until 2007 that the
revolution took place. The iPhone was the start a new generation of mobile
phones: the smartphones. </p>
<p>In all humility, it's a comparison we can make with
confidence: MITO is the iPhone of performance drinks. MITO is part of the 'functional
drinks' market, where there is a whole range of products designed to provide a
specific benefit. No doubt you'll be familiar with some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Energy Drinks</b></li>
<li><b>Isotonic drinks</b></li>
<li><b>Vitamin drinks</b></li>
<li><b>Multi-fruit drinks</b></li>
<li><b>Fruit juices</b></li>
<li><b>Tea drinks</b></li>
</ul>
<p>But all these drinks share the same shortcoming. They
each have just one benefit. They are <i>either</i>
healthy <i>or</i> performance-enhancing.
Never both.</p>
<p>MITO is different. It is both healthy <i>and</i> performance-enhancing. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1384319/files/20150414233443-2015-04-15_083332.png?1429079683"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>MITO is the only
drink that meets the demand for both health and performance enhancement.  </b></p>
<p>Need a quick boost? Have a MITO. Its immediate effect
will be to wake you up. But in the long term it will help protect you from
illness and boost your performance levels. The improvement in your health comes
about not through isolated vitamins or minerals but, sip by sip, through cell
regeneration and the stimulation of ATP production.</p>

<h2><b>Convinced?
Why not support us?</b></h2>
<p>With MITO, we have created a new and truly valuable
addition to the drinks market. But we still have challenges to overcome. In
order to communicate MITO's extraordinary benefits, we have to address the lack
of awareness among the general public and explain the function and importance
of mitochondria. <br/>
Our launch campaign, entitled MITO BEGINS, gets across the innovative benefits
of the product and is designed for high-frequency roll-out across the channels
relevant to the target market. </p>
<p><b>Initial investments</b></p>
<p>Our
formula is of the highest quality. And the production of MITO is subject to
strict regulations. To produce a 60.000-bottle batch we need approximately 50.000 euros.<br/>
For the PR campaign explaining mitochondria and for the integrated marketing
and communications campaigns we initially need approximately 30,000 euros.  </p>
<p>Your support will help us meet these challenges. For

<p>Living healthily means living in harmony with the laws
of nature. This is something we often forget in the hectic world we have built

<p>For many years now, the MITO Group has operated under
the banner of 'health and performance', enabling us to create a new and unique
concept as well as our own highly effective natural products for the full range
of mitochondria in our bodies. The philosophy behind the MITOcare product range
is 'a return to the ancient laws of nature'. MITOcare products contain only
bioidentical natural ingredients and are free of artificial additives. This
means that MITOcare does not rely on high-dosage single ingredients but rather
low-dosage complex formulations that occur in nature.</p>
<p>Right from the start, thanks to its experience of
developing preparations for mitochondrial medicine, the MITO GROUP has been
involved in developing 'mitochondria-activating formulas'. MITO drink is the
result.</p>

MITO - Archetyp einer neuen Getränke-Generation-Der Mitochondrien Drink-Anti Aging für Deine Zellen


Ein rein natürliches Getränk, mit dem Du Deine Leistungsfähigkeit auf gesunde Weise steigerst. Nachhaltig.



Dafür sorgt der einzigartige
mitochondrien-aktivierende Wirkstoffkomplex.
Du willst gesund und aktiv sein und bleiben? Dann
stärke deine Mitochondrien. Entdecke das
Geheimnis von Vitalität, Gesundheit und Leistungsfähigkeit. 
Deine Mitochondrien.





Drei
Aspekte stecken hinter dem Mito Drink und der dauerhaften Steigerung deiner
ganzheitlichen Leistungsfähigkeit:
Unsere Vision
Deine Mitochondrien
Die revolutionäre Innovation 




Unsere Vision -
Leistungssteigerung auf natürliche und gesunde Weise. 
Kranke Gesellschaft
Zu den Krankheiten unserer Zivilisation  -viele davon Ergebnisse der unerbittlichen Leistungsdruckgesellschaft und der zunehmend schlechter werdenden Umweltbedingungen -  zählen neben Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen, Diabetes und Bluthochdruck vor allem auch Burn-out und Depressionen. Wer das Glück hat, sich in München im Burn-out-Diagnostik-Institut behandeln lassen zu können, erhält den kostbaren Vorzug einer individuellen Therapie. Diese umfasst neben den schulmedizinischen Ansätzen auch alternativmedizinische Wege, wie z.B. den der mitochondrialen Medizin.
Gesundheit fördern
Zwei der führenden Mitochondrien-Spezialisten aus Deutschland behandeln ihre Patienten nachhaltig: Mit hochwirksamen Naturstoffprodukten werden die Mitochondrien gezielt aufgebaut. Ganz ohne Chemie und ohne künstliche Stoffe, die der Körper nicht verarbeiten kann. So werden die Beschwerden an der Wurzel gepackt.
Viele Patienten bestätigen eine Verbesserung ihres individuellen Wohlbefindens innerhalb kürzester Zeit. Da werden die labortechnischen Belege der Genesung beinahe nebensächlich. 
Innovative Idee
Doch warum die Menschen erst behandeln, wenn sie krank sind? Viel besser ist es doch, vorhandene Leistungsfähigkeit und Gesundheit auszubauen. 
Wie? Klar, in dem die Menschen ihre Mitochondrien stärken. Auf natürliche Weise und natürlichem Weg: Über ein naturstoffliches Getränk.




Formel für die FlascheMission: Es soll ein ""Mitochondrien - aktivierender Wirkstoffkomplex"" für ein Getränk der neuen Generation"" entwickelt werden. Schritt eins: 2012 Die Ärzte und Spezialisten des Burn-out-Diagnistik-Instituts kontaktierten renommierte Professoren aus dem Bereich der Molekular-Biologie und gewannen sie auf Anhieb für die Idee. Es wurde eine Task Force ins Leben gerufen, die die Vision - Steigerung der zellulären Leistungsfähigkeit für alle Menschen - möglich machen will. Und wird. Schritt zwei: 2013 Intensive Forschungs- und Entwicklungsarbeiten begannen. Begleitet, gestützt und getragen durch zahlreiche Studien. Schließlich gelang es, den Mitochondrien-aktivierenden Wirkstoff zu extrahieren. Ein Meilenstein.
 ----Link HP Studien? Schritt drei: 2014 Konzeption und Design des Getränks starteten unter strengsten Auflagen. Ende 2014 konnte der Wirksoffkomplex in einer speziell aufeinander abgestimmten Komplexmischung aus rein natürlichen und qualitativ hochwertigen Inhaltsstoffen als Getränk - MITO - hergestellt werden. Der Durchbruch.Schritt vier: Heute. Herstellung und Vermarktung von MITO,das Getränk, das Gesundheit und Leistungsfähigkeit gleichermaßen fördert, soll erfolgen. Produktion und Aufklärungsarbeit sind kostenintensiv, die Entwicklungsinvestitionen waren hoch. Somit: Warum das Getränk, das Alle unterstützen kann nicht auch von allen unterstützen lassen? Das Crowdfunding. 
Schritt fünf: Morgen. Die ersten 250.000 Flaschen laufen vom Band. Unsere Marketing- und Aufklärungskampagne überzeugt das Land. MITO hat Euer Leben etwas besser gemacht. Danke.

Deine Mitochondrien - 



Dein Schlüssel zu mehr Gesundheit, Jugend & Leistungsfähigkeit. 

Den
Schlüssel zu Gesundheit, Jugend & Leitungsfähigkeit trägst Du in Dir, in
jeder Deiner Zellen: Deine Mitochondrien. Mitochondrien sind die
Energie-Kraftwerke der Zellen. In jeder menschlichen Zelle befinden
sich zwischen 500 bis 5000 Mitochondrien. Sie bilden den Energiestoff ATP
(Adenosintriphosphat), der für den gesamten Stoffwechsel der Zellen notwendig
ist. ATP entsteht - vereinfacht ausgedrückt - wenn in den Zellen Glukose mit Sauerstoff oxidiert (oxidative
Phosphorylierung), also ""verbrannt"" wird. Die Verbrennung setzt
Energie frei und wird zu ATP verstoffwechselt. ATP transportiert die Energie
dann dorthin, wo sie benötigt wird. Und das nicht nur für physische
Funktionen. Auch das Nervenkostüm, die Verdauung, die Neubildung von Haaren und
Haut benötigt dieses ATP.


 ATP-Produktion
Somit
logisch: Die leistungsfähigen Zellkraftwerke (Mitochondrien) produzieren das
ATP, das dein gesamter Organismus benötigt. Umgekehrt: wird aufgrund einer mitochondrialen
Störung nicht genügend Energie produziert, funktioniert der Organismus nicht
richtig. Es kommt Sand ins Getriebe, der nach einiger Zeit massive Schäden
anrichtet.
Du kannst dem vorbeugen. Die mitochondriale Leistung Deiner Zellen bestimmt
Deine individuelle Leistungsfähigkeit. Stärke Deine Zellen - bleibe gesund.

Die revolutionäre Innovation -MITO - ""iphone der functional drinks""


Seit ca. 1985 gibt es es portable Telefone, mit denen man ohne Vermittlung telefonieren konnte. Ab 1992 wurden sie zum Produkt für jedermann. Die Revolution fand 2007 statt. Das iphone war der Beginn einer völlig neuen Mobiltelefon-Generation: der Smartphones.
Bei aller Bescheidenheit scheuen wir nicht den Vergleich: MITO ist das iphone der funktionellen Getränke. MITO wird dem Markt der funktionellen Getränke zugeordnet. Hier tummeln sich Getränke mit Zusatznutzen. Ihr kennt sie wohl alle:


Energy Drinks
Iso- Erfrischungen
Vitamingetränke
Mehrfruchtgetränke
Nektar
Teegetränke




Ihr gemeinsames Manko: Sie haben jeweils nur einen Zusatznutzen. Sie sind entweder gesundheits- oder leistungsfördernd. Niemals beides.
Mit MITO ist eine neue Dimension eröffnet worden: gesundheits- und leistungsfördernd.







MITO ist das einzige Getränk, das die Ansprüche an Leistung und Gesundheit kombiniert. 
Du brauchst kurzfristig einen Schub? Trink MITO. Macht wach, aber auf Dauer nicht krank, sondern leistungsfähiger. Die Gesundheitsförderung wird nicht durch isolierte Vitamine oder Mineralien erbracht, sondern durch Zellregeneration und Förderung der ATP-Produktion. Schluck für Schluck.

MITOCHONDRIEN AKTIVIERENDER WIRKSTOFFKOMPLEX










Überzeugt? Unterstütz uns.



Mit dem MITO haben wir eine neue und wirklich wertvolle Getränke-Dimension geschaffen. Wir haben damit auch neue Herausforderungen zu bewältigen. Um den einzigartigen Mehrwert des MITO zu kommunizieren, müssen wir gleichzeitig das Informationsdefizit der Gesellschaft beseitigen und Aufklärungsarbeit über die Funktion und Wichtigkeit der Mitochondrien leisten. Unsere Markteinführungskampagne ""MITO BEGINS"" kommuniziert den innovativen Zusatznutzen und soll zur Markteinführung hoch frequentiert in den zielgruppen-relevanten Kommunikationskanälen implementiert werden.


Initiale InvestitionenUnsere Komplexmischung ist qualitativ absolut hochwertig. Die MITO Produktion unterliegt strengen und speziellen Vorgaben. Für eine Produktion von ca. 60.000 Flaschen benötigen wir ca. 50.000 EUR.Für die Aufklärung über Mitochondrien sowie integrierte Marketing - und Kommunikationskampagnen benötigen wir zum Start ca. 30.000 EUR.  

Helft uns durch Eure Unterstützung diese Herausforderungen zu bewältigen. Unser Newsblog hält Euch auf dem Laufenden.

Wir stehen dahinter


Leben und Gesundheit bedeutet in Einklang mit den Naturgesetzen zu leben. Dies wird in unserer aktuellen, hektischen Zivilisationsgesellschaft häufig vergessen. Künstlich hergestellte Lebensmittel, synthetische Medikamente und unnatürliche Aromastoffe sowie Konservierungsmittel sind mit gesunder Lebensweise nicht zu vereinbaren.  Diese bringen immer seltener ausschließlich Nutzen, sondern rufen immer häufiger erheblichen Schaden im menschlichen Organismus hervor.

Die MITO Group beschäftigt sich seit Jahren mit der Thematik ""Gesundheit und Leistungsfähigkeit"". Hier wurden ein neu- & einzigartiges Konzept sowie eigene hochwirksame Naturstoffprodukte für die Gesamtheit der Mitochondrien entwickelt. Die Philosophie hinter der MITOcare Produktreihe lautet ""Zurückkehren zu uralten Naturgesetzen."" MITOcare Produkte enthalten ausschließlich bioidentische Naturstoffe ohne synthetische oder künstliche Zusätze. Dabei verwendet MITOcare keine hochdosierten Einzelstoffe, sondern niedrig dosierte Komplexmischungen, wie sie in der Natur vorkommen.
Aufgrund der Erfahrungen und Entwicklungen von Präparaten für die mitochondriale Medizin, wurde die MITO GROUP von Beginn an in die Entwicklung des ""Mitochondrien  - aktivierende Wirkstoffkomplex"" und den daraus resultierenden MITO einbezogen.
Wir werden weiter daran arbeiten, unsere Vision Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen.

MITO – a new generation of drinks is born.

A healthy, purely natural drink that enables long-term performance.
It's all down to the unique mitochondria-activating
formula. 
Want to be healthy and active?
And stay that way? Then give your mitochondria a boost. Discover the secret of
vitality, health and performance. 
The mitochondria.






Mito Drink, and the long-term increase of your overall
performance levels, rely on three key factors:

Our vision


Your mitochondria


A revolutionary innovation 





Our vision -
Enhancing your performance – naturally and healthily
An ailing society
Among the many illnesses our society helps to cause –
many of them due to the relentless pressure to perform and the increasing
degradation of the environment – are cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and high
blood pressure, to name just three. But chief among them are burn-out and
depression. Anyone being treated at Munich's Burn-Out Diagnostic Institute will
have the great advantage of receiving an individualised treatment programme
that includes not just conventional medicine but also alternative therapies
such as those based on mitochondrial medicine. 
Promoting health
At the Institute, two of Germany's leading mitochondria
specialists treat their patients for the long term. Highly effective natural
products are used to target and build up the cells' mitochondria. No chemicals
or other artificial agents are used, as the body cannot process them. In this
way, we address the root cause of the difficulties. 
Many patients report feeling better very quickly. Next
to that, the actual clinical proof of their recovery is almost of secondary
importance. 
An innovative idea
Why wait until people get ill to treat them? Surely it
is far preferable to build up the health and performance levels they already
have.
How? By strengthening their mitochondria. Naturally –
with a drink made from natural ingredients.



A formula that can be bottled
Our
mission is to develop a 'mitochondria-activating formula for a new generation
of drinks'. 
Step
one. In 2012, doctors and specialists at the Burn-Out Diagnostic Institute
contacted prominent figures from the world of molecular biology and immediately
won them over to the idea. A task force was put together. Its aim? To increase
the cellular performance of people everywhere. 
Step
two: In 2013, intensive research and development began, accompanied, supported
and borne out by numerous studies. Then, a milestone: the successful extraction
of the mitochondria-activating agent. 
Step
three: in 2014, the concept and formulation of the drink began under strict
conditions. Then, at the end of 2014, the breakthrough. The formula of active
ingredients could finally be manufactured as a drink – MITO – using a carefully
calibrated mixture of 100% natural and high-quality ingredients.
Step
four. Today the manufacture and marketing of MITO, the drink that promotes both
health and performance, is ready to roll. But manufacture and PR are expensive
and development costs have been high. So then came the idea. Why not let MITO,
the drink that can benefit everyone, be funded by everyone? In other words, by
crowdfunding.
Step
five: tomorrow. The first 250,000 bottles are coming off the production line.
Our marketing and PR campaign is explaining the benefits of MITO to everyone.
MITO has had a positive effect on your life. Thank you.


Your mitochondria
–The
key to better health, feeling younger performing better. 

The key to better health, feeling
younger and performing better lies within you in each and every one of your
cells. In your mitochondria. Mitochondria are the cell's powerhouse. Every
human cell contains somewhere between 500 and 5,000 mitochondria. The
mitochondria build the energy-bearing molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is needed by the cell's entire metabolism. Put simply,
ATP is produced when glucose is oxidised, or 'burned' (a process known as oxidative phosphorylation). This combustion releases energy and
is metabolised into ATP. The ATP than transports the energy to where it is
needed. And not just for physical functions. The nervous and digestive systems
and the build-up of new hair and skin all require ATP.

ATP production

So as you can see, the cellular powerhouses
represented by the mitochondria produce the ATP that is needed buy your entire
body. Or put another way, if as a result of mitochondrial defect insufficient
energy is produced, then the body will not function properly. It's like grit
getting into a machine. Over time, it can cause significant damage.
But you can stop this happening. The mitochondrial
performance of your cells determines your individual performance. So give your
cells a boost – and stay healthy.

A
revolutionary innovation –
MITO - 'the iPhone of performance drinks'

Portable phones have existed since about 1985. In 1992
they crossed over into the mass market. But it wasn't until 2007 that the
revolution took place. The iPhone was the start a new generation of mobile
phones: the smartphones. 
In all humility, it's a comparison we can make with
confidence: MITO is the iPhone of performance drinks. MITO is part of the 'functional
drinks' market, where there is a whole range of products designed to provide a
specific benefit. No doubt you'll be familiar with some of them:

Energy Drinks
Isotonic drinks
Vitamin drinks
Multi-fruit drinks
Fruit juices
Tea drinks

But all these drinks share the same shortcoming. They
each have just one benefit. They are either
healthy or performance-enhancing.
Never both.
MITO is different. It is both healthy and performance-enhancing. 



find out more on our website
MITO is the only
drink that meets the demand for both health and performance enhancement.  
Need a quick boost? Have a MITO. Its immediate effect
will be to wake you up. But in the long term it will help protect you from
illness and boost your performance levels. The improvement in your health comes
about not through isolated vitamins or minerals but, sip by sip, through cell
regeneration and the stimulation of ATP production.
 mitochondria-activating formula




Convinced?
Why not support us?
With MITO, we have created a new and truly valuable
addition to the drinks market. But we still have challenges to overcome. In
order to communicate MITO's extraordinary benefits, we have to address the lack
of awareness among the general public and explain the function and importance
of mitochondria. 
Our launch campaign, entitled MITO BEGINS, gets across the innovative benefits
of the product and is designed for high-frequency roll-out across the channels
relevant to the target market. 
Initial investments
Our
formula is of the highest quality. And the production of MITO is subject to
strict regulations. To produce a 60.000-bottle batch we need approximately 50.000 euros.
For the PR campaign explaining mitochondria and for the integrated marketing
and communications campaigns we initially need approximately 30,000 euros.  
Your support will help us meet these challenges. For
up-to-the-minute developments, see our news blog.

7% of MNHC clients deliver by C-section (the national average is 32.8%).
97% of MNHC clients return to the Center for postpartum exams.

""Everyone makes me feel comfortable, and I can talk to them about what I need to."" -CenteringPregnancy Participant

<div>
<p>The 2 common concerns of many frequent air-travelers are phone battery power and baggage weight.</p>
<p>When one is on the move, it is not easy to find an appropriate place to charge charge the mobile phone during the trip. Another problem is that all, if not most airlines have a limit on the baggage weight and excess baggage is always levied with exorbitant charges.</p>
<p>From that experience of ourselves, we developed <b>AirScale</b>, combining the functions of charging phone battery and luggage scale in a smart and unique way. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>AirScale prepares air-travelers for excess weight problem during airport check-in and it can calibrate weights up to 40kg now. In the LCD screen, you can select either kilograms or pounds to be displayed. <p></p>
<p>For charging of mobile phones, AirScale can recharge most mobile phones fully for more than 2 cycles. With a capacity of 5,600mAh consisting of Samsung battery cells, the charging time is 2 times faster than most power banks one find in the market, with currents of 2A (input) and 2.4A (output). </p>
<p>What also make AirScale unique is its great design. On the front of AirScale, the display window is not visible when not in use and you are greeted with the beautiful black glossy surface. When the device is in use, the numbers, indicating the battery level and weight will come on in red.</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) and Telomere Biology Disorders (TBD) are a devastating and extremely rare disease with severe, and often fatal, symptoms.  It attacks people of any age, but occurs more frequently in children, resulting in an average mortality age of 16.  It can affect almost every system in the body, causing bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, liver problems, susceptibility to various cancers, and a host of other serious issues.  Its symptoms often masquerade as other illnesses, and because it is so rare, most doctors have never seen a case; this often leads to misdiagnosis and mistreatment, with sometimes disastrous consequences.  For this reason, Dyskeratosis Congenita Outreach - an all volunteer nonprofit organization formed to support patients and families with DC/TBD and educate the medical community - has undertaken the creation of a Clinical Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment and management of the disease.  This document will be written by the foremost international medical experts on DC/TBD in every area of specialization, and both published in hard-copy form and made available on our website as a resource for doctors and patients alike all over the world. We already have the talent lined up, what we need now is your help. Because DC/TBD is so rare, the pool of affected families from which we draw donations is very small, so we must rely on the kindness and generosity of people like you to help make this life-saving endeavor a reality.  </span><br/>

Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) and Telomere Biology Disorders (TBD) are a devastating and extremely rare disease with severe, and often fatal, symptoms.  It attacks people of any age, but occurs more frequently in children, resulting in an average mortality age of 16.  It can affect almost every system in the body, causing bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, liver problems, susceptibility to various cancers, and a host of other serious issues.  Its symptoms often masquerade as other illnesses, and because it is so rare, most doctors have never seen a case; this often leads to misdiagnosis and mistreatment, with sometimes disastrous consequences.  For this reason, Dyskeratosis Congenita Outreach - an all volunteer nonprofit organization formed to support patients and families with DC/TBD and educate the medical community - has undertaken the creation of a Clinical Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment and management of the disease.  This document will be written by the foremost international medical experts on DC/TBD in every area of specialization, and both published in hard-copy form and made available on our website as a resource for doctors and patients alike all over the world. We already have the talent lined up, what we need now is your help. Because DC/TBD is so rare, the pool of affected families from which we draw donations is very small, so we must rely on the kindness and generosity of people like you to help make this life-saving endeavor a reality.

Therefore we need some more time (approximately February 2017). We will keep you informed about our progress in production and shipping via the ""Update"" section.  Concerning shipping costs: We decided to work with DPD, a partner who stands for quality and the best pricing possible. Nevertheless shipping an item of nearly 7 kilograms (incl. book and mineral substrate) is not the same as sending a postcard...Here you can see our first prototype:",17.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b><i>gFood+</i></b> was developed as a tasty, less

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>gFood+</i></b> costs LESS than $1.99 per meal, less than $7.96 per day when you buy a 10-day supply. And our prices go even lower when you buy more (check out the perks on this page). That’s WAY LOWER than other instant products in our category like Soylent. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">For

<h3>Why Are We Crowdfunding?</h3>

production runs. Our products are not yet in stores, and they’re not available

reach these larger markets. Our company CAN’T move forward without you! Here’s
one practical example... <b><i>gFood+</i></b> contains natural ingredients
and NO space-age chemicals, but our current package is silver. Sturdy, yes, but
the aesthetic truth is that we should change our package color to better

can help us do that. </p>

today. We ship four packs NOW to anyone who orders. Beyond that, we expect to

<p>As many of your know Rhys has been physically transitioning his gender for some time now. He began taking testosterone on May 23, 2012. Many changes in his voice, body hair, facial structure and body fat distribution have jumpstarted his transition.</p>
<p>Many transgender people experience what has been labeled as dysphonia. Dysphoria is the feeling that aspects of one’s body ""isn't right"" - that it feels wrong, that is should be something else, or it makes that person extremely uncomfortable. In many ways, gender dysphonia describes a person's relationship with their body and frames their experience in our world. For Rhys this is very true when it comes to his chest.</p>
<p>Rhys binds every day. The binder is very tight. It restricts movement. It gives him severe rashes on his underarms. The binder causes him to be very hot in the summer, often times unbearably so. Sometimes his dysphonia is so emotionally painful that he needs to wear his binder to bed to feel comfortable but this makes getting comfortable physically very hard.</p>
<p>Rhys and I have been working for months to find a way to pay for top surgery as soon as possible to end this aspect of his physical and emotional discomfort. Over the last few days we made the plan of withdrawing money from my 401K to cover the surgery. As we have experienced before, our hopes soared. It looked like it was happening. He scheduled a presurgery appointment with the surgeon in Philly, Dr. Rumer, which we have carefully selected for many reasons.</p>
<p>Then this morning I learned that I can only withdraw half of the funds that I thought I have access to. Friends and family- I NEED HELP to make this happen for the love of my life. Yesterday as we thought things were coming together to pay for and schedule the surgery he was lighter than I have seen him in a while. He was talking about the hope and the new beginning that this surgery will provide him with. I will do everything I can to have that NOT be snatched away from him.</p>
<p>Please help with whatever funds you can. I will have a thank you and congratulations party after surgery when he is ready to celebrate.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Barbara Shepherd and I am the Community Relations and Events Coordinator for Concord Counseling Services.  Concord Counseling Services is a private nonprofit organization that provides support for people struggling with mental  health issues including drug and alcohol abuse, grief, stress, anxiety, suicide and more.  More than 2,000 clients including men, women, and children of all ages and economic conditions pass through the doors annually.  Over 90 doctors, psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, are so passionate in helping their clients.

The organization is in desperate need of an exhibit that reflects the excellent services the organization provides.  This exhibit will be used at health fairs, community, college, and schools' wellness events, as well as senior conferences. Your funding will help Concord Counseling Services provide continued support to those people who struggle day to day with mental health issues.
 What We Need & What You Get
 We need a flexible up-to-date, lightweight and portable exhibit that tells the story of Concord Counseling services.  Easy assembly and disassembly is necessary for our employees to prepare rapidly for these events.  We have identified a display system that meets all of our criteria.  The distributor has offered a nice discount for the system.  Because the organization serves so many different age groups and clients, we need several different panels (each is 27 1/2 "" w x 76 3/4"" h) with services customized to the age group i.e., college students, high school students, seniors, and alcohol and drug addiction.
We need $3,500 in order to purchase the basic display unit and 6-8  fabric panels.  That figure also includes artwork necessary to produce the panels.
If we do not reach our entire goal, we will create as many panels as we have the funds to do.  
Should we exceed our goal, the extra money will be used to hire an additional psychiatrist.  Currently the wait to see one of our psychiatrists is one year.  This is unacceptable.  When someone is bleeding internally, waiting one year, is disastrous.
The Impact
 The clients we serve could be your parent dealing with the demise of another parent and the ensuing grief; it could be a family member dealing with a nasty, gut-wrenching divorce; or it could be one of your children who is being bullied and feels suicide is the only answer.  We currently provide counseling services in four major school districts helping children with many issues including drugs, suicide, poor grades.
Your contribution is invaluable to helping Concord heal people in mind and spirit with programs and services that change lives.
Risks & Challenges
 In the past there has been such a stigma to ""mental health""; yet today times are changing and people are learning that mental health is just as important as physical health.  This exhibit will certainly aid in getting the word out and helping to overcome the stigma associated with  these challenges.

<p>Hi y’all, My name is Jayna Anderson and I'm the owner and creator of 5th Dimension-  an herbal skincare company based out of Maurice, Louisiana.  I am crowdfunding for my business to expand my production volume and offerings! Read on for more info, and check out the <strong>exclusive perks </strong>only available through this campaign!</p>
<p>I started 5th Dimension years ago while problem solving my own ailments from chronic dry skin and anxiety to the common cold and menstrual cramps with herbal remedies and handcrafted topicals. After sharing my creations with solely friends and family for some time, 5th Dimension was released for online sale in January 2018, offering small batch herbal skincare. But I didn’t just stop there- in order to deepen my understanding of herbalism, I attended the Samara School of Community Herbalism in New Orleans, which fortified the knowledge I acquired over the years of personal study and practice. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562182236/cpnnxuhnvoteoyyskrqi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My education coupled with my self-taught business skills has fully empowered me to take my tiny business to the next level in order to serve more people. I’m so happy with the impact that my little skincare brand has had- whether it be through the hundred of positive responses from patrons or being able to connect with people from across the country - I want to be able to do more, and I need your help to do that.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""5th Dimension products are hands down the best thing that's ever happened to my skin! The Sub Rosa Serum and Mystic Mud are a true revelation and are the products I HAVE to use every day, leaving me moisturized and zit free. In a time where I'm constantly worrying about where all my products come from- if they have added ingredients, and if they are made ethically,-5th Dimension makes me feel at ease knowing that each product is handcrafted ethically by an individual who is really invested in the well being of my skin!"" </i>- Lea H.</p>

This is such an exciting opportunity, but it comes with it’s own set of challenges, and in order to accommodate the launch and do it in a productive and safe way, we need to open a legitimate production facility. (I currently make my products in a tiny <i>100 square foot apothecary</i> that overlooks my chicken coop). This production facility would open the doors to huge growth for 5th Dimension and allow me to grow my team while connecting to a greater audience.

My hope is to release a full line of alcohol-free herbal extracts for daily support and rebalancing disrupted systems. Sober folks deserve to have access to potent herbal extracts without feeling triggered by alcohol.

<p>5th Dimension’s skincare line is designed to heal while promoting a stronger relationship with you, yourself and the land. It's true that nothing heals like mother nature, and something as simple as your herbal infused face oil can fill that missing link on days when a hike in the woods isn't on the menu! 5th Dimension relies on strong medicinal plants grown in nutrient dense soil to heal- not just our skin’s imbalances, but the relationship with us and the planet that feeds us. We source a good portion of our herbal ingredients from small scale sustainable farms.</p>
<p>Together, we are working to create a better, greener future. 5th Dimension is invested in our commitment to respecting the earth, each other and ourselves along the way. With your help, we can increase our support of small U.S. farms and make a greener, greater difference. </p>

<p>We need $10,000 to take on this major project of growth! Here's more details on the funding goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fundraising goal is flexible, meaning we will keep all funds raised even if I don't hit the 10k goal.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal of 10k, the acquired funds will be dispersed from production facility to buying packaging in bulk to keep costs low. It will delay the release of our supplement line, as I won't be able to get my set-up compliant by the end of the year without funding.</li>
</ul>
<p>From production to creation, I believe in transparency so here’s what the money will help me do:</p>

Our patent-pending design features UV-C sterilization technology that kills up to 99.9% of all bacteria and viruses. Our easy-to-use hydraulic lift function and dust cover help safely store brushes in a safe and clean environment. Brushean also includes an automatic five-minute timer and operates with a rechargeable battery. It’s simple, sleek and safe. Say goodbye to gross bacteria and germs that quickly accumulate on your makeup brushes and can lead to serious skin problems! Dermatologists recommend cleaning makeup brushes every day to remove harmful bacteria yet a recent study found that more than 80 percent of women don’t wash their bushes after each use.The truth is the average person doesn’t have time to thoroughly clean their brushes each day. We are busy and have more important things to do. That’s why we created Brushean! Use our device on a daily basis to keep your tools sanitized and bacteria-free. You’ll look and feel your best when your makeup brushes are clean and performing at their best. Brushean can’t replace washing out the brushes with soap and water, but it absolutely helps prevent bacteria and germ build up.Why is it important to clean our brushes?  Without consistent sterilization, bacteria builds up over time and is extremely harmful to your skin’s health. Our UV-C lamp can remove up to 99.9% of bacteria with the UV-C wavelength.

But the devices available today have some major limitations. Heart rate straps are uncomfortable, they chafe, and can’t transmit in water. Watches are notoriously inaccurate during workouts and can’t retain much, if any, data. And because all the devices are so uncomfortable, most everybody takes them OFF when they’re not working out, losing critical data about their cardiovascular fitness, exercise recovery and readiness to train.<br/></p><p>The FitLinxx AmpStrip™ addresses these limitations and enables competitive athletes to take heart rate training to the next level. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1121601/files/20141229105741-YOUR-CHANCE-TO-REVOLUTIONIZE.png?1419879461"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Like you, we are competitive athletes.   We understand your desire to squeeze out every last bit of performance by training right to the edge.

Here are some questions that have come up from contributors during the campaign. Thanks for the feedback. Be sure to see our <a href=""#faq"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FAQs</a> for more. </p>
<h4>Do you have plans to support ANT+ in a later version?</h4>
<p>
    We are not able get ANT+ into this round of the product, but it is definitely something we will revisit after we ship this version.  At this stage, we cannot commit to an exact time when we will support ANT+.</p><p></p><h4><b>How will you handle international orders?  Will I be charged import tax or other charges on delivery?</b></h4><b>EU customers: </b> Please add the required additional contribution for shipping+VAT.  Your order will be shipped out of our UK office, and this additional contribution will cover all import/delivery charges. <br/><p></p><p><b>All other international customers</b>:  Please add the required additional contribution for shipping only.  Note that the buyer is responsible for all duties, taxes, or other fees which may be added on import/delivery.</p><p>* If you forgot to add the additional contribution to your order, please place a separate order with the required amount and we will link it to your original order.</p>
<h4>
    What about Windows Phone?</h4>
<p>
    We are not planning on Windows Phone Support for product launch. But, it is something we are strongly considering for later in 2015.</p>
<h4>
    I'd love to be a Beta tester!  How will the Beta program work?</h4>
<p>
    Anyone who contributed to our Indiegogo campaign at the Podium level will be eligible for our Beta program – which is anticipated to kickoff in March 2015. We will hold a random drawing to determine who gets in.  Unfortunately, we will not be able to support everyone in the Beta, so we will be leaning toward the folks that supported us early on. </p>
<h4>
    Will the adhesive cause any skin sensitivity or an allergic reaction?</h4>
<p>
    The AmpStrip uses a hypoallergenic medical-grade adhesive that has been tested on large populations and therefore should not cause any issues.  As with anything that touches the skin(materials, fabrics, soaps, etc.), we do anticipate that a very small percentage of the population may develop a reaction.  In these cases we will honor our money-back guarantee. </p>
<h4>
    Will the AmpStrip work for me if I have an irregular heart beat?</h4>
<p>
    The AmpStrip is a single lead ECG that does ""see"" the entire QRS complex.  But, to detect an AFib or other irregular heart rate event it would need to be a medical device - which it is not.  A future version of the product may have those capabilities, but it would be marketed separately from this device.</p>

</p>
<p>This is our first foray into consumer products that we would sell directly - and we want to get it right. We know how to manufacture. We know how to distribute.  We need your help to innovate even faster and take the AmpStrip to the next level. Please help us change the way athletes train and compete. </p>
<p>We'll be asking some of our early contributors to be part of our beta program where you'll get a Beta version of the product to test and give us feedback. Get in early and be one of the first to get an AmpStrip.</p>

<p>We have completed the prototyping and Alpha stages of the device development and are starting to make the Betas.   Key lessons on how to make this advanced type of wearable have been learned and incorporated; how to turn the sensor data into information and insight; how to make the durable, incredibly thin electronics over-molded device; and how to make low cost replacement adhesives that capture the heart signal and get it into the AmpStrip. Next step is to translate all of this into manufacturing at scale – something we have extensive experience doing. </p>

<h4>What is the AmpStrip and how does it work?</h4>
<p>The AmpStrip is a waterproof, rechargeable, wearable device that adheres comfortably to your torso and continuously tracks your heart rate, physical activity, and other vital bio signals 24/7 – during activity, rest, recovery, and sleep.
The AmpStrip is applied to the left side of your torso, where a super-sensitive single lead ECG sensor captures a clear heart rate signal.  It uses the industry standard Bluetooth LE® to continuously communicate with your mobile app of choice and display real time data and insights.  It will store up to 24 hours of data when you’re away from your mobile device, and sync as soon as it is within range.</p>
<h4>What  does the AmpStrip track?</h4>
<ul>
<li>  Heart rate and  heart rate zones</li>
<li>Resting heart rate when worn while sleeping</li>
<li>Heart rate recovery</li>
<li>Respiration</li>
<li>Skin temperature</li>
<li>Posture</li>
<li>Steps</li>
<li>Calories burned</li>
<li>Active time </li>
<li>Sleep</li>
<li>Stress</li>
</ul>
<h4>What types of activities  does the AmpStrip track?</h4>
<p>The AmpStrip is an all-day acitivty and heart rate monitor. It is designed to be worn  during workouts, rest, recovery, and sleep. It tracks  popular activities like  walking, running, cycling, swimming, cross fit,  etc..</p>
<h4>How do I wear the AmpStrip?</h4>
<p>The AmpStrip is worn on the left side of the torso, under the left pectoral muscle.  For women, it should be positioned just below the sports bra.  To wear it, you will put a new adhesive on it, then simply remove the backing from the adhesive and press it firmly to your body (Just like a Band-Aid®).</p>
<h4>How long can I wear the AmpStrip?</h4>
<p>The AmpStrip is designed to be worn all day and will last between three and seven days depending on the length and intensity of your activity.   Our AmpInsights mobile app will notify you when it’s time to remove your AmpStrip. </p>
<h4>How/When should I remove the AmpStrip?</h4>
<p>You should remove the AmpStrip adhesive once the device peels away from your body enough that the data stops flowing to the App or the App tells you to change the adhesive. </p>
<h4>How often should I replace my adhesives?</h4>
<p>You should replace the adhesive with a new one each time you put the AmpStrip on.  This will typically be every 3-7 days. <strong>It helps to rotate the areas where you put the AmpStrip each time. </strong></p>
<h4>How much will the replacement adhesives cost?</h4>
<p>3-6 month supply of adhesives cost $30. </p>
<h4>Is the battery rechargeable or does it need to be replaced?</h4>
<p>The AmpStrip comes with a wireless recharging station. The rechargeable battery will last up to 7 days and take about 60 minutes to recharge.</p>

</div></div>","We have decided to suspend development of AmpStrip as a
fitness product. We are offering full
refunds to all contributors. Please visit www.ampstrip.com
to learn how to get your refund.Ask the world’s best athletes ""What’s the single most important biometric you monitor while training?"" and they all answer the same. Heart rate. But the devices available today have some major limitations. Heart rate straps are uncomfortable, they chafe, and can’t transmit in water. Watches are notoriously inaccurate during workouts and can’t retain much, if any, data. And because all the devices are so uncomfortable, most everybody takes them OFF when they’re not working out, losing critical data about their cardiovascular fitness, exercise recovery and readiness to train.The FitLinxx AmpStrip™ addresses these limitations and enables competitive athletes to take heart rate training to the next level. Like you, we are competitive athletes.   We understand your desire to squeeze out every last bit of performance by training right to the edge.  We know the pain and agony of a season cut short by an overtraining injury.
That's why we built the AmpStrip. AmpStrip enables athletes to “Train to the Edge” while avoiding injury. AmpStrip accurately monitors heart rate, exercise load, resting heart rate, recovery heart rate and other biometrics all day, every day, helping you understand exactly how hard you are pushing your body and where you are in the training-recovery cycle. The FitLinxx AmpStrip™ is a thin, waterproof device that tracks heart rate and activity around the clock with accuracy – all within a device as discrete and comfortable as a Band-Aid®. It can be comfortably worn all day, every day. It easily sticks to your torso and automatically tracks heart rate, activity, exercise load, skin temperature and posture.  It also provides critical fitness insights like resting heart rate and heart rate recovery.




Here are some questions that have come up from contributors during the campaign. Thanks for the feedback. Be sure to see our FAQs for more. 
Do you have plans to support ANT+ in a later version?

    We are not able get ANT+ into this round of the product, but it is definitely something we will revisit after we ship this version.  At this stage, we cannot commit to an exact time when we will support ANT+.How will you handle international orders?  Will I be charged import tax or other charges on delivery?EU customers:  Please add the required additional contribution for shipping+VAT.  Your order will be shipped out of our UK office, and this additional contribution will cover all import/delivery charges. All other international customers:  Please add the required additional contribution for shipping only.  Note that the buyer is responsible for all duties, taxes, or other fees which may be added on import/delivery.* If you forgot to add the additional contribution to your order, please place a separate order with the required amount and we will link it to your original order.

    What about Windows Phone?

    We are not planning on Windows Phone Support for product launch. But, it is something we are strongly considering for later in 2015.

    I'd love to be a Beta tester!  How will the Beta program work?

    Anyone who contributed to our Indiegogo campaign at the Podium level will be eligible for our Beta program – which is anticipated to kickoff in March 2015. We will hold a random drawing to determine who gets in.  Unfortunately, we will not be able to support everyone in the Beta, so we will be leaning toward the folks that supported us early on. 

    Will the adhesive cause any skin sensitivity or an allergic reaction?

    The AmpStrip uses a hypoallergenic medical-grade adhesive that has been tested on large populations and therefore should not cause any issues.  As with anything that touches the skin(materials, fabrics, soaps, etc.), we do anticipate that a very small percentage of the population may develop a reaction.  In these cases we will honor our money-back guarantee. 

    Will the AmpStrip work for me if I have an irregular heart beat?

    The AmpStrip is a single lead ECG that does ""see"" the entire QRS complex.  But, to detect an AFib or other irregular heart rate event it would need to be a medical device - which it is not.  A future version of the product may have those capabilities, but it would be marketed separately from this device.
Read More FAQs“I’m a fitness junkie and track all my biometrics with a heart rate strap.  But since I can’t wear it 24x7 I lose a ton of data about recovery and readiness.  AmpStrip SOLVES that problem.""- Jenn""I have a power meter to measure my WATTs on the bike and a GPS watch for my pace on runs.  Finally there’s something for my pool and open water training that helps me improve my performance by understanding what heart rate zones I’m operating in."" - Rob""I’m a serious, competitive age-grouper.  I train hard and demand the best equipment.  My AmpStrip allows me to track my heart rate not just during an event but leading up to it and during recovery.  And that’s how I stay at the top of my age group and on top of the podium."" - Walter


                       











“A perfect example of where fitness tracking — or life tracking — can go as technology shrinks.”





 “…Certain kinds of athletes … would prefer to wear a discrete and nearly invisible patch on the midsection as opposed to a tracker on their wrist.”





“…Medical science has been working on a way to build health sensors into stickers. AmpStrip might have gotten there first.”


""Look, whatever, I just want one.""

AmpStrip is smart enough to track all of your training activity, whether it’s running, cycling, swimming, cross fit, weights, walking or sleeping. It also knows when to take measurements like resting heart rate and heart rate recovery, without you having to do anything. It sends this data to the AmpInsights™ App (both iOS and Android) where you can track progress during and after your workouts.
  















This is our first foray into consumer products that we would sell directly - and we want to get it right. We know how to manufacture. We know how to distribute.  We need your help to innovate even faster and take the AmpStrip to the next level. Please help us change the way athletes train and compete. 
We'll be asking some of our early contributors to be part of our beta program where you'll get a Beta version of the product to test and give us feedback. Get in early and be one of the first to get an AmpStrip.

We are dedicated to your complete satisfaction. If you have any problems at all, simply contact our Support team at support@fitlinxx.com and we’ll make it right or issue you a full refund.
What is the AmpStrip and how does it work?
The AmpStrip is a waterproof, rechargeable, wearable device that adheres comfortably to your torso and continuously tracks your heart rate, physical activity, and other vital bio signals 24/7 – during activity, rest, recovery, and sleep.
The AmpStrip is applied to the left side of your torso, where a super-sensitive single lead ECG sensor captures a clear heart rate signal.  It uses the industry standard Bluetooth LE® to continuously communicate with your mobile app of choice and display real time data and insights.  It will store up to 24 hours of data when you’re away from your mobile device, and sync as soon as it is within range.
What  does the AmpStrip track?

  Heart rate and  heart rate zones
Resting heart rate when worn while sleeping
Heart rate recovery
Respiration
Skin temperature
Posture
Steps
Calories burned
Active time 
Sleep
Stress

What types of activities  does the AmpStrip track?
The AmpStrip is an all-day acitivty and heart rate monitor. It is designed to be worn  during workouts, rest, recovery, and sleep. It tracks  popular activities like  walking, running, cycling, swimming, cross fit,  etc..
How do I wear the AmpStrip?
The AmpStrip is worn on the left side of the torso, under the left pectoral muscle.  For women, it should be positioned just below the sports bra.  To wear it, you will put a new adhesive on it, then simply remove the backing from the adhesive and press it firmly to your body (Just like a Band-Aid®).
How long can I wear the AmpStrip?
The AmpStrip is designed to be worn all day and will last between three and seven days depending on the length and intensity of your activity.   Our AmpInsights mobile app will notify you when it’s time to remove your AmpStrip. 
How/When should I remove the AmpStrip?
You should remove the AmpStrip adhesive once the device peels away from your body enough that the data stops flowing to the App or the App tells you to change the adhesive. 
How often should I replace my adhesives?
You should replace the adhesive with a new one each time you put the AmpStrip on.  This will typically be every 3-7 days. It helps to rotate the areas where you put the AmpStrip each time. 
How much will the replacement adhesives cost?
3-6 month supply of adhesives cost $30. 
Is the battery rechargeable or does it need to be replaced?
The AmpStrip comes with a wireless recharging station. The rechargeable battery will last up to 7 days and take about 60 minutes to recharge.
Can I swim/shower/immerse the AmpStrip in water?
Yes, the AmpStrip is waterproof and the adhesives are designed to resist, absorb and release water while retaining adhesion to your body.  The AmpStrip is encased in a durable, biocompatible silicone housing for worry-free use in the pool or open water, while showering or under conditions of extreme perspiration.
Is the AmpStrip FDA approved?
No.  The AmpStrip is intended for consumer use only and is not a medical device.

Which devices are compatible with the AmpStrip?

The AmpStrip can be used with  Bluetooth LE® mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets.
Will the AmpStrip work with my existing apps? 
The AmpStrip is compatible with fitness apps that support BlueTooth LE® heart rate monitors, such as EndoMondo, MapMyRun, RunKeeper, and Strava.
Will the AmpStrip be compatible with smart watches like the Apple Watch or the Samsung Galaxy Gear?
We intend to make sure the AmpStrip will work with smart watches, but those details are not yet finalized.

30 mins training = 2 hours workout
Burn more calories and fasten the metabolism
Grow muscle efficiently and increase strength effectively
Improve endurance level and accelerate power rehabilitation
Relax your muscle and speed up recovery
Multiple modes and continuous APP upgradation available
  Traditional EMS devices used to be complicated and expensive. During the rapid development of E-textiles science since the 2010s, EMS technology becomes widely used by fitness enthusiasts and successfully remarketed and reintroduced to the masses in the forms of EMS training studios and EMS sportswear.In 2016, we completed the development and manufacture of Wisnefit-EMS suits, but it still required bulky wires and external hub(battery). Of course, that inconvenience is hard to accepted by the mass. So we decided to redesign the whole structure and make it from Suits to Sportswear.In 2018, Wisenfit made an innovative breakthrough in electro-fabric and phone-powered technology, then thoroughly test in 2019. Finally, we achieve the lightest and the most comfortable EMS clothing in the world.After only a few weeks of regular practice, you may achieve desired results such as muscle strengthening or shaping, fat burning, and muscle relaxation.  That's why EMS gaining popularity with athletes and average gym-goers alike.The effects achieved by EMS during a workout is similar to the results obtained by increasing the level of weight resistance during exercise— the higher the current density, the more massive the resistance. For this reason, we recommend using EMS no more than 30 minutes in a workout as it is equivalent to 2 full hours of intensive training sessions. Thanks to the portability of WISENFIT, EMS training is no longer limited to members of EMS training centers and studios. WISENFIT users can also combine our product into training sessions for optimal results.After stimulating the growth of muscles, these active muscles will continue to burn even within a few hours after exercise. Our body system can continue to maintain a higher metabolism, and prolong the calorie consumption. WISENFIT can be used for practical EMS-assisted training at any time, whether for static or dynamic exercises so that endurance can be effectively improved during each workout. Studies conducted on animals by NASA have proven the positive effects on the muscle-skeletal system by long-term use of EMS.  Muscle release is one of the widely-recognized usages of EMS technology. In the quiescent state of motion, the WISENFIT relaxation mode can regularly emit pulse signals that cause the muscles to contract and relax.  WISENFIT can also be used to help relax the stiff shoulder, neck, and back muscles of office workers and anyone else who must sit or stand for long periods. Since EMS can speed up metabolism, it has the overall potential to relieve pain and accelerate muscle recovery.Yes, muscles move autonomously and Wisenfit brings an effect enhancement while you are training. It feels like using a fascia gun.The total weight of Wisenfit is about 400g, almost the same weight as a can of Coca.  Don't worry about the battery, the power consumption is really very low, even lower than your earphone.  The fabric has high resilience, which ensures the comfortability of wearing and makes sure it is fit enough to a workout.Conductive fabric offers the softness and malleability of material, while also having electrical properties. Wisenfit adopts the best in class materials 'Conductive rubber by Carbon Nanotubes,' and that will make our users feel like touch to a second skin. Compare to the other EMS devices. The users do not require to spray water to the power zone before wearing it!The sportswear is highly durable. It can be washed by a washing machine, but not only limited to hand washing. It is highly recommended to wash it in a laundry bag to prolong the washability. WISENFIT easily withstood over 1000+ hours of washing machine testing.We understand that EMS applies electrical stimulation to various muscle groups while the individual performs exercise movements. Here is the working principle behind this.EMS generates electrical pulses that stimulate the human muscles by simulating the brain’s natural electrical pulses and standard input-output patterns.Wisenfit is so easy to use in just a few steps:1. Put it on and connect the shirt with the pants/ trousers by the inner snap2. Connect your mobile with the sportswear by the outer snap3. Open the APP and choose the mode4. Put your mobile in the pocket, and you are ready to go! Each mode corresponds to different electrical stimulation intensities and intervals that suit various applications and scenarios. WISENFIT can also be used to help relax the stiff shoulder, neck, and back muscles of office workers and anyone else who must sit or stand for long periods. Now, access to EMS fitness will no longer be limited only to professional athletes— now fitness enthusiasts around the world can also enjoy staying in great shape.Risks and challengesLogistics and CustomsWisenfit-EMS is a new type of product.

SCUBAJET accepts the challenge and brings some of the most popular aquatic activities to the next level. The water sports gear allows to make decisions based on individual needs or habits by combining motor power and paddling.  Comparable to an e-bike, it turns your aquatic equipment into fast, comfortable and reliable devices.Stand up paddling (SUP) is one of the fastest-growing water sports nowadays. Within a few seconds and requiring no tools SCUBAJET turns every stock board into a powerful e-SUP-board. On top of that, SCUBAJET can be used for other water sports, like canoeing, dingys and even for diving.While conventional diving scooters are often big and bulky and weight between 10 and 25 kg (22 to 55 lbs.), the SCUBAJET has a streamlined appearance with only 3 kg (6.6 lbs.) including the Dive Adapter. Additionally underwater scooters are most often unwieldy, whereas the SCUBAJET allows to decide even during the dive whether to be used or not. If the SCUBAJET is not needed at the moment, it can simply be fixed to the buoyancy compensator – without any compromises. This simple solution is unique, there's nothing like it on the market. The SCUBAJET is constructed for max. pressure of 6 bar/87psi. We use a special shaft seal that can handle this amount of pressure. The theoretical depth limit based on the pressure is max. 50m/196ft. We give a warranty up to 45m/147ft.   One of the big advantages is the innovative adapter system that provides various possibilities to use SCUBAJET on any imaginable water sports equipment. No technical skills are needed at any point. The plug&play system and the water resistant remote control make it easy to start, stop and select different speeds while using it on the water.
adapter systems and SCUBAJET Take your existing board or equipment and extend it with SCUBAJET easily. Select the appropiate adpater and you are ready to go in a few seconds. We provide adapters for SUP, kanu, dinghi boats and dive. Many of the adapters use standardized finplugs for maximum convenience. By now we support and provide adapters for more than 20 different manufactures and many of them use standardized finplugs. So it's easy for us to provide compatible adapters.

SCUBAJET brings you back to the shore safely and is made for active people and sports enthusiasts as well as families. the handy dive adapter SCUBAJET on SUP-board with kids in a dinghi on the water perfect for snorkeling SCUBAJET offers various engine mappings for scuba diving (slow speed and long battery lifetime), power mode (short high speed sprints), SUP (paddling support or surfing without paddle) or freehand. We have tested and implemented a bunch of great features like the SmartPower Technology. It offers long battery time up to 240 minutes with the internal battery and up to 720 minutes with the external battery pack. The external battery pack will be available with beginning of 2017. Due to the latest safety and security regulations for batteries, there is a limit of two spare batteries per person for the larger lithium ion batteries (up to 160 wh per battery). But as we know traveling is particulary important of many water sports fans, it was very important to us to meet your expectations and so we now provide a travel battery pack that consists of 2x160 wh batteries, that is allowed on airplanes! 
   Measuring only 58 cm (~22 inch) length and a diameter of 7,2cm (~2,8 inch) and weighing just 3kg (~6,6 lbs), SCUBAJET is easy to transport and fits in every backpack.  You can control the SCUBAJET easily with the included remote control. Three buttons control all the functions, for increasing/decreasing speed, as well as to spot the engine. The auto-shut off system stops the engine immediately if you fall into the water and it will also be used for initial power on SCUBAJET over magnetic switch. SCUBAJET is also safe for kids as well since we use jet-power instead of regular propeller motors. Every SCUBAJET has a high tech LED light in the front with 500 Lumen.It's not only super practical while staying on the water during your canoe-, dinghi- or SUP trip for underwater lighting, its also possible to use the lamp without the engine unit. The lamp alone is also proofed for a depth of 45m.And that's not all! If you need more Lumen for diving as example you will be able to upgrade the lamp to 1.500 Lumen or add it as accessory. 
 

 

 

 

 

 
During the entire development process, SCUBAJET was used by a lot of different people to get their opinion and as much feedback as possible. We've started to create a jet-engine for different applications two years ago and we already started the serial production, so it's a great opportunity for you to get the best price ever for the SCUBAJET.   Scope of delivery: SCUBAJET, charger, remote control, finbox adapter
After we receive your order you can choose between different adapters for SUP (FCS II Fin System, Future Fin System, O'Fish'l Fin System, LokBox Fin System, ProBox Fin Systems, US Finbox System) or kanu (Sevylor, universal adapter).

Electronic Health Record Patent Portals and  patient engagement organizations strive to empower consumers as we do with Reunion Care.  Our difference is two fold.  Reunion Care's central focus is creating and activating a Circle of Care.  The senior user invites family, friends and professionals to join in his/her health journey.  Circle of Care members use the six forms of communication to create a well coordinated care plan.  The second difference is we build concentric circles of long term service and support by inviting community based resources, financial and legal professionals to join with all the health care providers in the senior consumer’s Circle of Care.  We extend health care’s reach into the neighborhood where each senior lives.
Thank you in advance for joining our revolution to transform health care.  Reunion Care targets seniors and their family where the Affordable Care Act has the greatest impact right now.  Your participation in Reunion Care helps us to do what banking did a decade ago – move the control of information from the institution out to the consumer/owner. Your contribution helps to  accelerate the consumer empowerment movement to chart your own personalized health journey.

<p>Millions of people today are in need of all natural foods and are seeking to better their quality
of life through diet and exercise. 
Grocery stores are filled with products that claim to be healthy but are

provide you with great tasting, non-toxic, organic snacks that leave you

<h3><b>Uttam finds abandoned children</b></h3>
<p>Uttam Kumar is a living saint who
finds unwanted and abandoned children on the streets of India and brings them
home. But Uttam needs our help because he just had a near fatal heart attack
and he has no way to pay for his medical expenses.</p>
<p>In April 2015, Uttam had angioplasty
surgery with vascular stents placed in his blocked arteries and he is slowly
recuperating. But Uttam has no time to be sick because he is responsible for
the care of the 52 children he rescued from the streets, from child trafficking,
starvation and abuse.</p>
<p><b> <a href=""http://worldschildren.org/uttam"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span></span></a><a href=""http://worldschildren.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">World’s Children</a> </b>helps with expenses for the children through its child
sponsorship program. But Uttam and Shobha have no paying job and no medical
insurance. They quit their jobs as social workers when they took in all these
unwanted children. So when catastrophe struck last month in the form of a
massive heart attack, they had to take out loans just to ensure Uttam’s life
could be saved.</p>
<p>Uttam is a rare individual who has
dedicated his life to saving unwanted children with no thought for himself. But
Uttam has no safety net. They can’t leave the children and go to work somewhere
else to pay off their debt. </p>
<h4><b>Sometimes
when you do the right thing, you don’t get paid for it</b></h4>
<p>On behalf of these 52 children who
need their father to be healthy and to care for them, we are asking for your
help. Uttam has always been there for these children and now it is our turn to
be there for him.</p>
<p>Uttam and his wife Shobha have no
money to pay for the loans they took out for his hospital expenses. In the US
the cost for angioplasty averages $57,000. In India, the medical costs for his
angioplasty treatment came to $6,500. To Uttam and Shobha these bills are
staggering. </p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Please help this saintly man</b></h3>
<p>If you have ever had a kind hand
lift you up the way Uttam has lifted up these children, please offer him a hand
now. Every penny of your donation will go to pay Uttam’s bills and your
donation is tax-deductible in the US through World's Children. </p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, 100% of donations will go to set up an emergency
medical fund for the Balavikasita Orphanage. That way Uttam, Shobha and the 52
kids who live there will have a health safety net. <br/></p>

</h3>
<p>In 2011 we introduced <a href=""http://www.tibetwomenssoccer.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tibet's first women's sports program</a> to the refugee community in India. A revolution has begun! To date we've formed 13 club teams in settlements located around India (with more coming soon), and are in effect changing Tibetan society by addressing women's empowerment issues at all our soccer training camps. Soccer is simply the tool through which we are giving Tibetan women a voice and opportunity to represent themselves and their country as never before.</p>
<p>By 2017, Tibet's first women's national team in ANY sport will be ready to debut on the international scene - a remarkable moment in the history of Tibet.<br/></p>
<h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3>
<p>We need your help for our Winter Training camp. 16 of the top players will gather for a three-week soccer/empowerment training, followed by a trip to distant <a href=""http://www.indiainmaps.com/maps/manipur-location-map.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Manipur (click here to see map of location)</a> for three highly publicized matches against some of India's top teams. The entire process will be filmed for a full-length documentary called <b><i><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Kickingboundaries"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KICKING BOUNDARIES</a></i></b>. It's amazing... it's incredible... it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for these girls!</p>
<p>We are asking you to support one of our players, or a portion of one - whatever you can afford. These girls don't have the most basic of equipment, and need your help to make this training possible. We need them looking and feeling good - and believe me, they deserve it.<br/></p>

In 2011 we introduced Tibet's first women's sports program to the refugee community in India. A revolution has begun! To date we've formed 13 club teams in settlements located around India (with more coming soon), and are in effect changing Tibetan society by addressing women's empowerment issues at all our soccer training camps. Soccer is simply the tool through which we are giving Tibetan women a voice and opportunity to represent themselves and their country as never before.
By 2017, Tibet's first women's national team in ANY sport will be ready to debut on the international scene - a remarkable moment in the history of Tibet.
What We Need

We need your help for our Winter Training camp. 16 of the top players will gather for a three-week soccer/empowerment training, followed by a trip to distant Manipur (click here to see map of location) for three highly publicized matches against some of India's top teams. The entire process will be filmed for a full-length documentary called KICKING BOUNDARIES. It's amazing... it's incredible... it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for these girls!
We are asking you to support one of our players, or a portion of one - whatever you can afford. These girls don't have the most basic of equipment, and need your help to make this training possible. We need them looking and feeling good - and believe me, they deserve it.
Soccer boots/cleats: $9
Sports bra: $3
Ball: $6
Travel Ticket to Manipur (bus & plane): $130
Accommodation & Food in Manipur: $100-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------$248 to support one of our 16 players for their winter training and competitions in Manipur!
TOTAL $3,968
BEST THING about making a donation to TWS? 100% goes to the girls. 100%!

<p>Everybody knows that sleep is important in the life of each and every person. Sleep takes approximately 1/3 of our entire life, therefore we should care about how good our sleep is.</p>
<h2>How does a quilt with a hole help me to sleep better?</h2>
<p>Many people sleep with their quilt in between their legs. The problem with that is that when you have a quilt in between your legs, your lower back is mostly uncovered. Having your lower back uncovered during the night is not healthy at all and it's not much comfortable either.<br/><br/><strong> With our Holey Quilt, we make it easy for you to lay your legs in a position that’s comfortable, but you still have your lower back fully covered. Now that’s something!</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

<br/><h2>Why is it so different from a regular quilt?</h2>
<h3>You will feel more comfortable</h3>
<p>It’s so much more comfortable to sleep with your leg or knee in the hole. You try it ones and you will never want to come back to a regular quilt.</p>
<h3>You will be healthier</h3>
<p>Your lower back is fully covered even though you have your quilt in between your legs. You wil not wake up in the middle of the night just because you were feeling cold.</p>
<h3>You will sleep better</h3>
<p>It’s been proved many times that sleep is an important part of our life. The better you sleep, the more productive you become during your awakened hours. The more refreshed you wake up in the morning, the less stressed you are during the day.</p>
<p>It does matter, how well you sleep at night.</p>

We are looking to raise $2000 to cover the expense of her co-pays and any other surprise expenses. The co-pays are $50 for each session. She will have to undergo a total of 32 sessions of Radiation Therapy.

</p>
<p>The tongue plays a major role in snoring and obstructive sleep apnea, as it relaxes during sleep and falls back into the airway to block breathing.</p>
<p>Our throat is basically a tube surrounded by muscles, and the tongue is the largest of these muscles. Everything works
well when we are awake. When we sleep, the muscles in our bodies relax, and the tongue falls backwards to
narrow the space for breathing. This sets people up for snoring and poor sleep.</p>

<h3><b>Truly revolutionary - Not just another mouthpiece </b></h3>
<p>We have discovered a way to move the tongue based on stimulating the taste buds and using the body’s natural reflexes.

<h3><b>How you can help</b></h3>
<p>Snoring can be a serious sleep issue for both the snorer and their bed partner. A good night's sleep affects your mood, your weight, and intimacy with your partner. It is not surprising that people resort to everything from special pillows to earplugs to sprays to uncomfortable mouthpieces to stop snoring and get better sleep. These have all been proven ineffective for many people.</p>
<p>The SleepAssure System has demonstrated user acceptance and success in initial studies. To achieve our goal of being the #1 sleep solution for snoring and obstructive sleep apnea, we will need additional data for an application to the Food and Drug Administration.<b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<p>This is where we need your help.  Right now we are providing access to the latest version of this product to address customer demand and to gather feedback to make the best product possible. This device is made available for a better night's sleep, and we cannot make any official claims at this time. You may contribute to make this revolutionary product a reality. <span>This campaign will provide the additional data needed for regulatory submission, product commercialization, and full market delivery.</span></p>

SleepAssure is a medical grade consumer device developed by a recognized team of physicians to deliver a better night's sleep for people who snore.   It is unlike anything else on the market: simple, comfortable, and easy to use. It really could become the #1 sleep solution in the world! 
The SleepAssure System delivers a pleasant flavor inside the front mouth during sleep, utilizing the body's taste reflexes to move the tongue forward toward this flavor.  This prevents the tongue from falling back to block breathing during sleep, allowing you to enjoy a normal night of sleep.
If you snore or you know someone that snores, you know the impact it can have on our relationships, our
performance, and even our health.

Doctors Make Technology Breakthrough To Deliver a Better Night's
Sleep For Snorers
Simple to Use: 

                                                 
           
The SleepAssure System includes three components: a pump the size of an iPod, thin tubing, and a mouth insert that is worn over the upper teeth at night.  The tube connects to the mouth insert so that it can provide liquid from the pump to the front of the mouth.  The pump can we worn on a comfortable armband at night or placed next to your bed.                        
                            
                     


                  
              



   
While you sleep, the SleepAssure System delivers the natural flavor that stimulates the taste reflex, brings the tongue forward, and keeps the airway open to deliver a better night's sleep          SleepAssure Benefits:• Natural: uses body’s natural taste reflexes to improve tongue position• Pain Free: no jaw or teeth discomfort, no side effects• Normal Sleep: no disruption of normal sleep patterns• Comfortable: use with mouth open or closed, no user acclimation needed• Better Oral Health: prevents tooth decay, provides fresh breathWhat causes snoring and sleep apnea?

The tongue plays a major role in snoring and obstructive sleep apnea, as it relaxes during sleep and falls back into the airway to block breathing.
Our throat is basically a tube surrounded by muscles, and the tongue is the largest of these muscles. Everything works
well when we are awake. When we sleep, the muscles in our bodies relax, and the tongue falls backwards to
narrow the space for breathing. This sets people up for snoring and poor sleep.


Research from Harvard Medical School and other leading institutions shows that even a small change in tongue position can make a big difference in snoring and better sleep. SleepAssure achieves this and more.
Truly revolutionary - Not just another mouthpiece 
We have discovered a way to move the tongue based on stimulating the taste buds and using the body’s natural reflexes. Our initial studies demonstrated that a small amount of pleasant, natural flavor in the mouth can activate the taste buds during sleep, moving the tongue forward and keeping the airway open.  


                             
Our team of highly recognized physicians and engineers have successfully combined efficacy and patient acceptance into a product to address snoring and improve sleep quality.What people are saying after trying it

-- ""Now, I just need to know when this product will be available to buy.  I'm anxiously awaiting!  ;)""
-- ""I think this is better than my CPAP machine""
-- “I had a better night sleep with the device, ... my wife said I did not wake 
her up with snoring at all”
-- ""I'm looking forward to getting one.  My husband can't wait either"" 

How you can help
Snoring can be a serious sleep issue for both the snorer and their bed partner. A good night's sleep affects your mood, your weight, and intimacy with your partner. It is not surprising that people resort to everything from special pillows to earplugs to sprays to uncomfortable mouthpieces to stop snoring and get better sleep. These have all been proven ineffective for many people.
The SleepAssure System has demonstrated user acceptance and success in initial studies. To achieve our goal of being the #1 sleep solution for snoring and obstructive sleep apnea, we will need additional data for an application to the Food and Drug Administration.
This is where we need your help.  Right now we are providing access to the latest version of this product to address customer demand and to gather feedback to make the best product possible. This device is made available for a better night's sleep, and we cannot make any official claims at this time. You may contribute to make this revolutionary product a reality. This campaign will provide the additional data needed for regulatory submission, product commercialization, and full market delivery.

<p>The FORM Collar is a vital tool to help you become a better, faster and more powerful lifter. Speed and strength are two essential components in lifting and for every lift you make, FORM analyzes the velocity, force production, and various acceleration metrics to give you helpful insights into when to push and when to back off your training. FORM then provides real-time data visualizations to give you insight into exactly what part of the lift you need to improve. <br/></p>

<p>The FORM Collar is not your average wearable. In fact, it's not a wearable at all. Instead, we've created a patent pending design that attaches directly to the barbell and contains over 7-motion sensors that produce metrics on par with similar tethered based devices.</p>
<p>The Collar was born out of a necessity to finally get accurate data in real time which it does seamlessly at a rate of 200 samples per second via bluetooth to the FORM Lifting app. </p>
<p>We don't just track how fast you move, like other less accurate, wearables, but how the elements of each lift are breaking down and can therefore, be directly attributable to potential weaknesses and imbalances within an athlete. We've been able to effectively measure metrics like hip drive, transitional force gap, and drop time, that have previously remained undetected by the human eye. </p>
<p>This is a great start to a new conversation about performance training, but none of it matters without progress. Access all your data from the FORM mobile or tablet app so you can share them with your coaches to get more feedback from them or brag about your sessions to your friends . You can even take your lifting profile with you between gyms to give other coaches and athletes insight into your current level of experience. Finally, a universal language for lifting.</p>
<p>This is a game-changer in the pursuit of performance, but  it's only the tip of the iceberg.<br/></p>

<p>We <i>believe</i> that all athletes train, be we <i>know</i> that FORM athletes train smarter. The FORM Collar has become the ultimate tool for coaches and athletes that want to gain insight into every part of every lift and use the data to drive performance.</p>
<p>While there are many philosophies on metric based training methods, there are still immense trial and error variables that make the process cumbersome, outdated and subjective. By implementing the FORM Collar into <i>any</i> training regimen for <i>any</i> athlete, we can now confidently quantify and test based on metrics that matter. The next generation in performance training is here.</p>
<p><b>Metrics That Matter</b></p>
<p>Velocity Based Training is definitely a buzz word in the world of sports performance training and while the FORM Collar is a perfect tool for this application, it provides so much more than just velocity metrics. <br/></p>
<p>The FORM Collar is constantly tracking the metrics of your lifts based on your height, weight on the bar and timing as well as the force and speed generated into the bar to a level of accuracy which is impossible to be seen visually. You now have access to metrics we've never been able to measure before such as maximum hip drive, enabling you to really drill your technique and maximize your performance.</p>

<p>However, hip drive is just one of the many meaningful metrics the FORM Collar provides. In fact, we've had to create names for metrics that previously could not be measured!</p>
<p>-Avg Velocity: Are you proportionally fast and explosive with heavier loads as you are with lighter ones? This is one of the true indicators of real gains in performance.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">-Transitional Force Gap: Do you know if you're speeding up or slowing down during the transition from the first to the second pull in your olympic lifts? Well you do now.</span><br/></p>
<p>-Second Pull Force: Hip drive, the holly grail of lifting metrics and all of athletic performance quantified. Finally.</p>
<p>-Yank Index:  Slow is smooth and smooth is fast. Find out if you need to stay more engaged when you start your lift or if you're smooth as butter.</p>
<p>-Push Time / Pull Time: You may be completing the lift but were you fast and explosive? Speed kills and is a better driver of performance in the long run.</p>
<p>-Max Force:  Training hard is great but training smarter is more efficient. Knowing how much wear and tear you're inflicting on your body will give you invaluable insight into when to push and when to back-off.</p>
<p>-Drop Time: Now you'll be able to see exactly what your coach means by ""faster elbows"". Muscle cleans any one?</p>

<p>FORM helps you analyze these metrics into your technique with intuitive visuals that let you review every lift or see a summary of your entire session. With our insights screen, you can review your lift through each segment of the lift, from start to finish. With our progress screen, we aggregate your lifts to identify your metrics over time creating a true indicator of gains in performance.

<p>It's time to 'cut the cord' with other more expensive devices and welcome in the convenience and versatility of the FORM Collar. The device, housed in a tough, glass-filled nylon enclosure, is seamlessly attached to a Lock-Jaw Pro Collar, the industry standard, in heavy-duty, durable barbell collars, and has been battle tested again and again. We've made sure that it can withstand the wear and tear of the weight room but still remain portable and lightweight. While we don't suggest you try to shoot it like a basketball into your collar bucket from across the gym (we know you've tried it), we are confident that it will withstand your training sessions, along side you, day-in and day-out.</p>

<p>At the heart of the FORM Collar is a custom circuit board that contains an array of sensor units housed in the glass-filled nylon enclosure . Each sensor unit is designed to pick up minute changes in every part of every lift. The unit also houses an accelerometer (3-axis), a gyroscope (3 axis) and and a magnetometer (3-axis) which provides the FORM app with information about the motion and orientation of the barbell in 3D space. The FORM Module, weighing in at only 2 ounces, attaches directly to the collar and won't get in the way of any of your lifts!</p>
<p>The FORM Module is powered and controlled by a battery and circuit board which are the brains of the system coordinating data collection at 200 times per second and streaming it in real time to the FORM App via low energy bluetooth.  The FORM Module is  charged using a standard Micro USB cable (included) and charges fully in about 2 hours. </p>

</div>","THE FORM COLLAR: THE FIRST OF ITS KIND





The first smart device to help you improve both the form and performance of all  barbell lifts. With 7 integrated motion sensors delivering 200 samples per second directly to the free FORM Lifting App on your smartphone, you’ll be able to see improvement in the palm of your hand, truly giving you metrics that matter.  With the ability to reference back to a single lift or an entire session with cloud-based storage, track your progress over time to drive your performance to new levels. 
Turning an ART into a SCIENCE 
The FORM Collar was simultaneously born in the gym and the lab, as a collaboration between athletes and coaches of all experience levels to capture their varying proficiencies in both form and performance. We meticulously considered the artistry AND the physics of each minute movement within each specific lift to deliver the most meaningful and insightful metrics giving you real indicators of performance, not just a pat on the back. With the FORM Collar you won’t just wonder if you’re improving, you’ll know.


Upgrade your training experience
Let's face it, 1 RMs don't cut it anymore. Being able to efficiently train at maximal power output at every session will allow you to see real gains in performance. No BS. Just key metrics and feedback to give you the ultimate unfair advantage on and off the field. If you’re an athlete, you train to win which means you need the best, most effective tools available, and the FORM Collar is available now.

FOR EVERY TYPE OF LIFTER
The FORM Collar is a vital tool to help you become a better, faster and more powerful lifter. Speed and strength are two essential components in lifting and for every lift you make, FORM analyzes the velocity, force production, and various acceleration metrics to give you helpful insights into when to push and when to back off your training. FORM then provides real-time data visualizations to give you insight into exactly what part of the lift you need to improve. 
It's all in the data.



Functional Fitness





Nail your form on light weights before going heavy and find the most efficient movement patterns for those long workouts. The FORM Collar is designed to capture touch and go reps so that you can truly maximize your work to rest ratio and crush your WODs.








Olympic Lifters



The FORM Collar is the first device that can actually give you metrics on individual parts of the Snatch and Clean & Jerk. Improve your technique by fine tuning your first to second pull transition (transitional force gap), hip drive (second pull force), and speed underneath the bar (drop time) all while increasing your explosiveness (push time) for squats and accessory lifts. 








Power Lifter




Identify strength imbalances that would otherwise be impossible to see with the human eye. With the FORM Collar, you can train efficiently on Dynamic and Max Effort days and by tracking your progress week over week, you'll be able to see exactly when to taper off and when to peak for competition.








Sport Specific




Speed and power are everything on the field so it's time to dump the 1RM and focus on your actual force production and velocity to see measurable and translatable increases in performance. Lift fast to be fast. 









Team Coaches



Create custom training programs, measure player improvements, and ignite competition in the weight room with the FORM Coaching Platform (Coming Soon).








Remote Coaching





Stay better connected to your athletes, from anywhere at anytime and get unbiased, unfiltered feedback on each of their training sessions to maximize your coaching effectiveness. If you usually use video analysis on your athletes, why not back it up with real data? With in-app video capture (coming soon), you'll be able to visually dissect your athletes' lifts with side-by-side metrics to back it up. Perfect practice creates perfect lifts.


TESTIMONIALS 

“If you train athletes, this is a no brainer. The FORM Collar has transformed the way we look at the power and olympic lifts by empowering the athlete's performance. Up until now, an athlete had to rely on an experienced strength and conditioning coach to pick apart their form and performance of a lift. With the FORM Collar, you can now see that information instantly in the palm of your hand to vastly improve results.” -John Welbourn, CEO of Power Athlete and Head Coach of FORM



THE COLLAR



The FORM Collar is not your average wearable. In fact, it's not a wearable at all. Instead, we've created a patent pending design that attaches directly to the barbell and contains over 7-motion sensors that produce metrics on par with similar tethered based devices.
The Collar was born out of a necessity to finally get accurate data in real time which it does seamlessly at a rate of 200 samples per second via bluetooth to the FORM Lifting app. 
We don't just track how fast you move, like other less accurate, wearables, but how the elements of each lift are breaking down and can therefore, be directly attributable to potential weaknesses and imbalances within an athlete. We've been able to effectively measure metrics like hip drive, transitional force gap, and drop time, that have previously remained undetected by the human eye. 
This is a great start to a new conversation about performance training, but none of it matters without progress. Access all your data from the FORM mobile or tablet app so you can share them with your coaches to get more feedback from them or brag about your sessions to your friends . You can even take your lifting profile with you between gyms to give other coaches and athletes insight into your current level of experience. Finally, a universal language for lifting.
This is a game-changer in the pursuit of performance, but  it's only the tip of the iceberg.
Our Vision, Your Expertise



We believe that all athletes train, be we know that FORM athletes train smarter. The FORM Collar has become the ultimate tool for coaches and athletes that want to gain insight into every part of every lift and use the data to drive performance.
While there are many philosophies on metric based training methods, there are still immense trial and error variables that make the process cumbersome, outdated and subjective. By implementing the FORM Collar into any training regimen for any athlete, we can now confidently quantify and test based on metrics that matter. The next generation in performance training is here.
Metrics That Matter
Velocity Based Training is definitely a buzz word in the world of sports performance training and while the FORM Collar is a perfect tool for this application, it provides so much more than just velocity metrics. 
The FORM Collar is constantly tracking the metrics of your lifts based on your height, weight on the bar and timing as well as the force and speed generated into the bar to a level of accuracy which is impossible to be seen visually. You now have access to metrics we've never been able to measure before such as maximum hip drive, enabling you to really drill your technique and maximize your performance.

Check out former NLF Receiver and GRID Athlete, James Townsend's hip drive as he applies nearly 600 pounds of force to the bar!
This graph displays the FORM Collar data, allowing users to quickly and easily review, replay, and, most importantly, truly understand a lift in real time.This groundbreaking feature of the FORM Collar opens a new door to proper form and performance for both athletes and coaches.
However, hip drive is just one of the many meaningful metrics the FORM Collar provides. In fact, we've had to create names for metrics that previously could not be measured!
-Avg Velocity: Are you proportionally fast and explosive with heavier loads as you are with lighter ones? This is one of the true indicators of real gains in performance.
-Transitional Force Gap: Do you know if you're speeding up or slowing down during the transition from the first to the second pull in your olympic lifts? Well you do now.
-Second Pull Force: Hip drive, the holly grail of lifting metrics and all of athletic performance quantified. Finally.
-Yank Index:  Slow is smooth and smooth is fast. Find out if you need to stay more engaged when you start your lift or if you're smooth as butter.
-Push Time / Pull Time: You may be completing the lift but were you fast and explosive? Speed kills and is a better driver of performance in the long run.
-Max Force:  Training hard is great but training smarter is more efficient. Knowing how much wear and tear you're inflicting on your body will give you invaluable insight into when to push and when to back-off.
-Drop Time: Now you'll be able to see exactly what your coach means by ""faster elbows"". Muscle cleans any one?







FORM helps you analyze these metrics into your technique with intuitive visuals that let you review every lift or see a summary of your entire session. With our insights screen, you can review your lift through each segment of the lift, from start to finish. With our progress screen, we aggregate your lifts to identify your metrics over time creating a true indicator of gains in performance. Using this, you can see if and where you have imbalances and weaknesses that indicate possible areas of improvement.
DESIGN & FEATURES
Battle Tested Design


It's time to 'cut the cord' with other more expensive devices and welcome in the convenience and versatility of the FORM Collar. The device, housed in a tough, glass-filled nylon enclosure, is seamlessly attached to a Lock-Jaw Pro Collar, the industry standard, in heavy-duty, durable barbell collars, and has been battle tested again and again. We've made sure that it can withstand the wear and tear of the weight room but still remain portable and lightweight. While we don't suggest you try to shoot it like a basketball into your collar bucket from across the gym (we know you've tried it), we are confident that it will withstand your training sessions, along side you, day-in and day-out.
How does it work (in case you're wondering)?


At the heart of the FORM Collar is a custom circuit board that contains an array of sensor units housed in the glass-filled nylon enclosure . Each sensor unit is designed to pick up minute changes in every part of every lift. The unit also houses an accelerometer (3-axis), a gyroscope (3 axis) and and a magnetometer (3-axis) which provides the FORM app with information about the motion and orientation of the barbell in 3D space. The FORM Module, weighing in at only 2 ounces, attaches directly to the collar and won't get in the way of any of your lifts!
The FORM Module is powered and controlled by a battery and circuit board which are the brains of the system coordinating data collection at 200 times per second and streaming it in real time to the FORM App via low energy bluetooth.  The FORM Module is  charged using a standard Micro USB cable (included) and charges fully in about 2 hours.

<p>Hello, I am the mother of Caresa Vance. I am also a Marine veteran who has served my country faithfully for over 21 years of active duty.  I have made sacrifices for my country that I don't regret, but now I need my country to sacrifice for me.  If you are a Marine, a military service person, a veteran, or anyone that appreciates the many sacrifices that military members freely make, I ask that you read this and consider giving.  All I need is 12,000 people to give $5 and I can give my daughter and possibly others like her a chance at true healing. Therefore I'm looking for a few good men and women that will stand with me.  If you know of any Marines or other military service members, please pass this on to them.  I know my Marine family won't leave another Marine behind, and I hope you feel the same too.  However, right now, I'm a Marine wounded  and suffering in a world that is not responding to my cries for help. </p>
<p>I desperately need your help. My daughter Caresa, is a young, vibrant spirit that has suffered with illness most of her life. She has a condition known as schizoaffective disorder which, over the years, has required a lot of treatment and frequent hospitalizations. As of this writing, she is once again in a psychiatric hospital and not getting better. Years of psychotropic drugs and undiagnosed physical illness have robbed Caresa of her spirit of life. I need <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">your</span></em> help giving life back to my daughter.</p>
<p>Caresa's story started many years ago when she was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary school, forcing me through court order to get her evaluated for meds. Never once did the school system or her doctors consider the traumas that happened to her as a child (while I was serving in the military) might have caused the issues she was having in school. At the time, I never realized that the side effects from these drugs could actually lead to psychosis for some people. When she started displaying symptoms and side effects, I was always told it would only last a short time. Caresa graduated from one drug to another, and from one diagnosis to another, until age 14 when they diagnosed her with schizophrenia, and more recently schizoaffective (Bipolar type) disorder.</p>
<p>Last year, I took Caresa to an outpatient alternative treatment facility and they found she had several severe allergies, infections, toxicity and chemical imbalances in her body. These imbalances cause Caresa to continue to relapse and end up back in inpatient psychiatric care (where they give her more psychotropic drugs). We cannot even begin to get Caresa the treatment she really needs to deal with the traumas she's faced in life, because of the (psychotropic) medication <em>roller-coaster </em>she has been on all of these years. The meds only mask the symptoms of what is really going on, and cause her severe side effects (the reason many mentally ill refuse to take them). The problem is, weaning her off of psychotropic meds in an outpatient setting does not give Caresa the intensive support she needs while her body adjusts to alternative medication treatments. When she feels unstable, the mental health establishment just puts her in a psychiatric hospital, back on higher doses of medications...and the recovery process begins all over again. Repeatedly rescuing Caresa from the abyss of toxic prescription medications has caused an extreme financial burden on my family, and I am still trying to pay expenses from her last outpatient treatment, and Caresa still needs many more treatments to clear her body of toxins and imbalances identified during her outpatient treatment.</p>
<p>Caresa desperately needs an alternative inpatient facility that can help wean her off meds while she gets her bodily imbalances corrected. Only then can she get the help she really needs to deal with her past and move on with her life. We know Caresa will do well with the new treatment program because we have seen so much improvement over the last year since she completed the outpatient program. And if that news wasn't good enough, she has also been blessed to lose over 130 pounds since she the beginning of her treatment regimen (as you can see by the pictures above).</p>
<h2><strong>Give Caresa HOPE For The Future</strong></h2>
<p>You can make a difference by giving a generous donation towards Caresa's inpatient medical treatment costs. We have set up a Patient Donation Account in her name at the Alternative To Meds Center in Sedona, AZ. Once we raise enough towards her treatment program, we will transfer the funds to her Patient Donation Account so she can start the program and (finally) get the help she really needs. Caresa will likely require a full three-month stay to get her started towards a full recovery.If she doesn't the monies will go to help others seeking treatment.  We really want to start sponsoring others to get this well needed treatment.  If you would like to learn more about the Alternative To Meds Center, please visit their website at <a href=""http://www.medicationwithdrawal.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.medicationwithdrawal.com</a>. The point of contact for donations is Steve Woodring at (540) 535-8876 (or email him at atmc.steve@gmail.com).</p>
<p>Again, I hope everyone can find it in their heart to contribute at least $5 and share this site with at least ten others who will do the same. We need every possible donation to help my daughter get her life back. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Every dollar received will go towards Caresa’s care and treatment!</span></p>
<p>Once Caresa gets her life back, we plan to publish her book detailing the road to her deliverance for others seeking knowledge and help for these and other similar afflictions.  I am already speaking to groups large and small, any that care to hear, that there is another way to help people with mental illness.  People don’t deserve the treatment they are getting from the government and corporate medical bureaucracy. Just putting people on heavy drugs will never be the answer to their problems. The regular hospitals are overcrowded, jails are becoming holding places for these people.  Now my brothers and sisters are coming back from war and they need REAL help as well.  I need to get the word out nationally, as well as internationally because of what my daughter and I have been through, I know we can make a difference in others’ lives as well so please don't ignore this campaign.  Give and pass it on.  Get it to a Marine or othe military service member and I know they will do what is right.  You may be helping to change the world.  One person at a time.  If we don't get these people the real help they need we are bound to see more incidents of crime and violence from this community who are not getting the true help they need from the current modality of treatment.  Again, please give and leave a comment here so we can generate national and international support for this community of people who cannot advocate for themselves. </p>

</div></div>","Denise from caregiving.com had her mom try out the Carbon Ultralight Walker. Despite her hesitance to use a walker it seems that the Carbon Ultralight has won her over. You can read the full review on Denise's blog right here: caregiving.com.  Carbon Ultralight is the coolest, lightest rolling walker ever made. It's the perfect tool for an active life filled with adventure. By drawing on design references from the car and bicycle industry and fast animals, we have designed a walker that brings something new to the table. A walker so lightweight, elegant and stylish that it motivates people to continue living their lives after they experience reduced mobility.Our users around Europe have already fallen in love with the Carbon Ultralight and now  we ask for YOUR support to help us introduce it in more countries around the world and help more people re-activate their lifestyle, one Carbon Ultralight at a time.   What makes Carbon Ultralight perfect for a short stroll or a thousand mile journey?The name says it all: A rolling walker made from carbon fibre that is truly ultra, ultra light. With the lightweight materials, easy folding, and sleek lines, it will easily fit in any car, train, boat or airplane, so you can keep discovering the world around you.        Whether you're looking for something classic, subtle or refreshing and daring we have just what you need. Our colour range offer something for every mood, outfit or taste. 

Carbon Black is a classic. The colour is inspired by the deep black colour often seen on fast cars and bicycles. It has a glossy finish and is perfect to compliment and highlight you and your style!

Strawberry Red is inspired by summer; filled with fresh, sun-ripened strawberries. The colour is fresh and strong – and it is the wildest colour we have in our range. If you want to stand out this is the colour you should choose! 

Oyster White is classy and elegant. As the name indicates, the colour is inspired by the white, pearly inside of an oyster. Besides having a pearly and shiny look, the colour is an almost creamy white that blends smoothly into the surrounding environments.
Choose your colour in the perk checkout flow. To provide you with the optimal comfort we have made two sizes; Regular Track and Wide Track. Which size to choose depends on how much you will sit on the seat and which comfort you'll want when you do it. Regular Track is made for the standard European doorway and has a track width of 24.6"" and a seat width of 16.5"". Wide Track has a wider track (26.2"") and wider seat (18.5""). It weighs only 0.3 lbs more than the regular Carbon Ultralight, so it is still the world’s (second) lightest rolling walker.

1) Take control of your eating habits
Choose from the recommended eating plans or a program of your own and use the app to set the times at which you should eat.

2) Avoid temptations with the help of vibrations
The unique FitTo mechanism senses when you start to eat. If it’s outside of your scheduled eating times, the device instantly vibrates for 30 seconds when you take a bite, effectively discouraging you from giving in to temptation. Then, a push notification from the app further motivates you to stay on track.

3) Lock your temptations away 
An optional locking mechanism makes it even easier to commit to your new diet plan. If you’ve struggled with discipline in the past, lock FitTo in place to help you stay on track. 
We especially recommend this for the first 1-2 weeks of your weight loss journey.

4) Get notifications when it’s time to eat
Never again forget your schedule or skip an important meal. The FitTo app will remind you when it’s time to eat.

5) Monitor your progress
Watch your discipline improve as you go and track the results using the app. Use the app to maintain your motivation to make tomorrow better than today.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
<p>We have come across some very valid concerns during this campaign, and we’d like to address some of them. We want everyone to feel that they are well informed about our cause and know exactly what our mission is. If you have any questions, please feel free to post them in the comments section.</p>
<p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Do the Kimballs really need my help?</span></em></p>
<p>To be honest, the Kimball’s plans for In Vitro do not completely hinge on the success of this campaign. However, that is not to say that our contributions aren’t going to go along way. They have been blessed to have Lila with them for almost 2 years, but it has definitely come with a hefty cost. This campaign was set up to help them continue with their family without adding to their existing burdens.  We also like to think that this is a great opportunity for us and anyone interested to help someone in need.</p>
<p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why does it cost so</span></em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> much?</span> </p>
<p class=""p1"">Created by friends, the goal amount was a number we felt was more obtainable; however, the overall cost is significantly more than a standard In Vitro procedure because of the unique nature of being the first people to distinguish Vici syndrome markers.</p>
<p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Is In Vitro necessary in order to have a healthy child?</span></em></p>
<p>Because of the genetic nature of VS, each child of the Kimballs would have a 1 in 4 chance of being affected by VS. To put that into perspective, the average woman has less than 1 in 1000 chance of conceiving a child with Down’s Syndrome.  In order to eliminate those risks, In Vitro allows doctors to analyze and select only the healthiest of eggs for implantation.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>How likely is the In Vitro going to be successful?</em></span> </p>
<p class=""p1"">Their program allows them six attempts at fertilization which gives a high chance of success.  If the fertilization isn't successful, the money donated will be used for fees in relation to adoption.  The money can be used for adoption because of the unique nature of the program.</p>
<p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Have the Kimballs looked into adoption?</span></em></p>
<p>Yes, the Kimballs are also open to adoption.  The biological and emotional factors of having their own children is strong enough that given the opportunity is available, they cannot pass up the attempt of fertilization.  That being said, they are currently in the process of becoming approved for adoption.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">If this campaign is in the Kimball’s behalf, who are the hosts?</span></p>
<p>My name is Jeff and I am a long-time family friend of the Kimball’s. A few months before Lila was born, Quinn helped me out by hiring me despite any experience in the optometric field. Quinn taught and trained me everything I know about being an optician which eventually led to my acceptance into optometry school. This was the best way I could think of to try to repay Quinn for all his help over the years.</p>
<p>I am also very happy and excited to have Quinn’s brother, Brady join me on the campaign. Brady has successfully managed crowdfunded campaigns before and brings valuable creativity and experience to the campaign. </p>
<p class=""p1"">We have seen the stress on Quinn and Kristi with Lila's health issues and the ensuing hospital bills. Therefore, we wanted to help in any way possible, and felt that this was the best opportunity to do so.</p>
<h2>Original Campaign Description</h2>
<p>Born in July of 2010, Lila Kimball is the twentieth documented person in the world to be found with Vici Syndrome (a rare recessive genetic condition). Her parents, Quinn and Kristi Kimball, started having concerns about her health and abilities at two months of age. A grueling twelve months later Lila was finally diagnosed with VS. Although, diagnosing Lila was a blessing of it's own kind, learning of the long-term affects of VS has been devastating. The Kimballs quickly realized that their dreams of having healthy children would hinge on the ability to perform In Vitro.</p>
<p>Lila's timing in this world has been nothing short of a miracle as she has been able to be a leading subject for ground-breaking Vici research and bring hope to families effected by VS. Using Lila's DNA, geneticists have been able to successfully locate the chromosome and gene responsible for VS and make it possible for families like the Kimballs to have healthy children of their own through In Vitro. In this process, each fertilized egg will be analyzed and only those without the recessive VS gene will be implanted.</p>
<p>All funds raised through this campaign will go directly towards the medical costs of the Kimball's In Vitro fertilization. If the fertizilation is unsuccessful,  </p>
<p>Any donation amount is greatly appreciated. We understand that some people may not be able to contirbute, but that doens't mean that you can't help us. We ask that anyone who sees this campaign talks to at least 3 people about our cause. It's easy to share this with others using the Indiegogo share tools!!</p>

Their program allows them six attempts at fertilization which gives a high chance of success.  If the fertilization isn't successful, the money donated will be used for fees in relation to adoption.  The money can be used for adoption because of the unique nature of the program.
Have the Kimballs looked into adoption?
Yes, the Kimballs are also open to adoption.  The biological and emotional factors of having their own children is strong enough that given the opportunity is available, they cannot pass up the attempt of fertilization.  That being said, they are currently in the process of becoming approved for adoption.
If this campaign is in the Kimball’s behalf, who are the hosts?
My name is Jeff and I am a long-time family friend of the Kimball’s. A few months before Lila was born, Quinn helped me out by hiring me despite any experience in the optometric field. Quinn taught and trained me everything I know about being an optician which eventually led to my acceptance into optometry school. This was the best way I could think of to try to repay Quinn for all his help over the years.
I am also very happy and excited to have Quinn’s brother, Brady join me on the campaign. Brady has successfully managed crowdfunded campaigns before and brings valuable creativity and experience to the campaign. 
We have seen the stress on Quinn and Kristi with Lila's health issues and the ensuing hospital bills. Therefore, we wanted to help in any way possible, and felt that this was the best opportunity to do so.
Original Campaign Description
Born in July of 2010, Lila Kimball is the twentieth documented person in the world to be found with Vici Syndrome (a rare recessive genetic condition). Her parents, Quinn and Kristi Kimball, started having concerns about her health and abilities at two months of age. A grueling twelve months later Lila was finally diagnosed with VS. Although, diagnosing Lila was a blessing of it's own kind, learning of the long-term affects of VS has been devastating. The Kimballs quickly realized that their dreams of having healthy children would hinge on the ability to perform In Vitro.
Lila's timing in this world has been nothing short of a miracle as she has been able to be a leading subject for ground-breaking Vici research and bring hope to families effected by VS. Using Lila's DNA, geneticists have been able to successfully locate the chromosome and gene responsible for VS and make it possible for families like the Kimballs to have healthy children of their own through In Vitro. In this process, each fertilized egg will be analyzed and only those without the recessive VS gene will be implanted.
All funds raised through this campaign will go directly towards the medical costs of the Kimball's In Vitro fertilization. If the fertizilation is unsuccessful,  
Any donation amount is greatly appreciated. We understand that some people may not be able to contirbute, but that doens't mean that you can't help us. We ask that anyone who sees this campaign talks to at least 3 people about our cause. It's easy to share this with others using the Indiegogo share tools!!

<p><b>MANY THANKS TO EVERYONE THAT SUPPORTED THIS CAMPAIGN!</b></p>
<p><span><b>Short Summary</b></span></p>
<p>Hi, I’m Esther Chang and I’m fundraising for my volunteer opportunity as an HIVAIDS Camp Counselor and Mentor for girls at Camp Angelina in rural Uganda. This opportunity is inspired by my own personal experience the last 9 years volunteering as an HIVAIDS Camp Counselor and Mentor to teens living with the virus in Northern California at <a href=""http://www.sunburstprojects.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Camp Sunburst</a>. Signing up to be a volunteer camp counselor in 2005 was one of the best decisions of my life and definitely the most rewarding activity I continue to do. After doing this work for so many years and having such success with the community in the States, I knew I wanted to continue this work abroad and share what I’ve learned with other communities in need.</p>
<p>As a camp counselor I provide information on prevention and medication, esteem building, coping, <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">stress reduction, transmission, disclosure, general reproductive health and overall wellness. Two years ago I started leading yoga at Camp Sunburst. It inspired me to get my certification in teaching kids yoga and mindfulness. Come December, I will continue to lead yoga and mindfulness to all campers at Camp Angelina. I am dedicated to this cause and community, specifically youth. More recently, I produced the build of the first free skateboard park in India with <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HolyStoked"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HolyStoked</a>, a local NGO, a skateboard play with local New York skaters and actors, and supported <a href=""http://triballink.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tribal Link</a>’s United Nations Training for Indigenous Leaders from around the world.</span></p>
<p>Through these experiences, I have been asked to travel to Uganda in order to volunteer for Camp Angelina, a sister camp to Camp Sunburst. Culturally and contextually, the experience will afford me with the opportunity to gain an understanding of HIV needs from the perspective of both locals and an international NGO, while simultaneously providing the opportunity to assist a community in need of prevention and advocacy.</p>
<p><b>What Is This Camp About?</b></p>
<p>Camp Angelina consists of one week of community outreach and one week of empowerment camp for over 80 girls aged 12-17 years who have been infected with or affected by HIVAIDS. Outreach involves actively going into the community to work directly with locals and activities range from health facility strengthening via workshops and trainings, home visits for OVCs (Orphans and Vulnerable Children) and PLWHA (People Living With HIVAIDS), and engaging community members in open dialogue concerning the problems facing the community, as well as the assets and strengths to be drawn upon in improving the community. </p>
<p>The camp will then emphasize healthy coping mechanisms, raise health literacy and health consciousness, provide life skills development, and draw on community organization techniques to empower women to openly discuss and conceive of solutions to community issues. Campers will also be given a rare opportunity to live free of responsibility and stigma for a week to engage in workshops, sports, yoga, and arts &amp; crafts. </p>
<p>Important dates:</p>
<p>Outreach: December 16 - December 22</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Camp Angelina: December 30 – January 3</span></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Duties &amp; Responsibilities Of Volunteers (What I Will Be Doing)</b></p>
<p><i>Home Visits</i></p>
<p>I will have the opportunity to visit homes in the villages. Here we will conduct needs assessments, basic health screenings and check ups, and psychosocial exercises to promote healthy coping. We may also deliver donated food, medication, and cooking supplies.</p>
<p><i>Facility Visits &amp; Assessments</i></p>
<p>I will be visiting local healthcare facilities and provide guidance and training within limited resources. Potential activities include testing and counseling training, HIV sensitivity training, pharmaceutical organization, storage and sorting, and basic storage and sanitation practices. The goal is to enhance quality by improving confidentiality, information delivery, autonomy, privacy, and staff treatment.</p>
<p>The following is a list of needs identified by the facilities themselves to get an idea of the types of issues I will potentially be working on:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Lack of dispensers at ART (antiretroviral therapy) clinic (thus need volunteers to train local volunteers and students in dispensing and refilling drugs)</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Medical records management and file retrieval</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Need for more skills in management of HIV clients &amp; medication</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Assist with dosing, including addressing issues of pill burden</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Support ART clinic team and HIV clients on nutrition education</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Need for skills in handling HIV status disclosure and stigma management, including issues of partner notification</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Training local clinic staff, community based-care volunteers and home care givers for HIV patients in palliative care</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Family caregivers support/sensitization</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Mentoring expert clients, and psychosocial support for affected families and infected individuals</span></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><i>Camp Angelina</i></p>
<p>Throughout the camp, I will be expected to be both a role model and a leader for activities. These can range from sports to empowerment activities to facilitating discussions. I will personally lead a daily yoga and mindfulness class for all campers.</p>
<p><b>AIDS Background</b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">One of the greatest effects of the AIDS pandemic is its impact on the psychological and mental health of children who have nursed and lost their parents under traumatic circumstances. The impact of parental death on children is complex and affects the child’s mental health and social energy, and might further result in stunted development of emotional intelligence and life skills. Many of the children Camp Angelina has worked with show psychosomatic disturbances, depression, very low self-esteem, disturbed social behaviour, hopelessness, low levels of life skills, etc. We have observed that with relatively unsophisticated, direct and culturally appropriate psychosocial and economic support interventions for children affected by AIDS, very encouraging results to improve the resilience and coping capacity of children can be achieved.</span><br/></p>
<p>Camp Angelina is solving these problems by empowering and advocating for the health and well being of OVC’s through community health education and economic development programs, by preventing the spread of HIVAIDS among young people and the general population using evidence- informed programming, improving the quality of life for people living with HIVAIDS through providing HIVAIDS counseling, care and referral treatment and providing psycho-social support to PLWHIV.</p>
<p><b>What I Need</b></p>
<p>My goal is $5,000 and any and all donations are tax deductible. As this is an unfunded position, these funds will be used to offset the costs of travel, transportation, housing, food, and other miscellaneous expenses for 3 weeks. I’m asking for donations from $10 and up. All donations are going to make this opportunity possible and any additional funds will go directly to Camp Angelina. We need funds for gas during outreach among other things and then all expenses for over 80 girls for an entire week of camp. It costs roughly $75 per child for the week of Camp Angelina.</p>
<p>NGO’s across the world rely on volunteers and I am here today to ask you to donate to this cause, to this organization, and to my continued support to teens living with HIV. And even if you can’t donate, if you can, please forward this along to someone you know who may be interested in supporting this cause. Your support is what’s going to make this possible.</p>

<blockquote><i>“Much of my young adult life was spent playing sports including track, football, swimming, and skiing. As a sophomore in high school, I dislocated my left knee. I spent the next year in rehab, only to dislocate it a second time. This forced me to deal with a series of radical knee operations - at last count five, over the next several years.</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>While I was suffering through my various recoveries, it paled in comparison to watching my father struggle with the excruciating pain of severe chronic Rheumatoid Arthritis. I found it especially difficult watching him deteriorate; each day his pain becoming increasingly worse, with traditional medicine providing very little relief.</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>After spending a good portion of my professional life as a therapist working in Cardio Pulmonary, I have seen a good deal of pain, much of it comparable to what my father must have been feeling. The difference was, of course, my father’s pain was personal rather than clinical. This was my dad.</i></blockquote>

<p><b>Frequently Asked Questions
</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Question: </b>Will NeoRelief relieve the
symptoms of rashes and itching, or does it only work on pain?</p>
<p><b>Answer: </b>NeoRelief does work on rashes
and itching. One of the powerful characteristics of NeoRelief is its
multifunctional use.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Question: </b>Does NeoRelief work on
burns as well?</p>
<p><b>Answer: </b>Absolutely. Gently apply the gel to
the affected area, being careful not to rub in. Sit back and allow the natural
ingredients to do their work. You may need to apply every 15 minutes for the
first hour, depending on the severity of the burn. Then decrease to once an
hour and then to every few hours, as needed. Make sure you apply on clean skin
and not over another topical cream.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Question:</b> I didn’t feel any cooling
or burning sensation when using this product; how do I know NeoRelief is
working?</p>
<p><b>Answer: </b>Don’t confuse this product with
conventional topical analgesics, which are counter irritants designed to
distract your attention from the pain to focus on a different sensation.
NeoRelief  works by stimulating the body
to heal itself and relieve the symptoms of pain. Make sure to quantify your
level of pain and then 15 minutes after the first application re-quantify your
level of pain. If you still have some pain, then reapply until pain is gone or
greatly reduced. Going from a pain level 8 down to a level 2, for example, is a
huge improvement! You may still have some pain, but at least it’s manageable or
tolerable. With natural medicine, the more you use, the better it works.
Whereas with conventional medicine, most often the more you use it, the more
your body develops a tolerance for the medicine.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Question: </b>Do I need to rub NeoRelief
in like most other topical analgesic products to work?</p>
<p><b>Answer: </b>No, it works better if you simply
spread a small amount over the clean area of discomfort and do not rub in.
Unlike so many products on the market, this product is non-greasy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Question: </b>What about scars, will
NeoRelief help with those?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>: Although not designed specifically
for scars, it will help to reduce potential scarring. It will also help reduce the itching and tenderness associated with the healing process. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Question: </b>Does this product also
work on headaches or migraines?</p>
<p><b>Answer:  </b>We
have seen great results on both, although migraines are usually more complex. A
little tip: to treat a headache, simply coat the forehead, temples, behind the
ears and back of the neck for best result. NeoRelief, more often than not,
works immediately with just one application. Sometimes it may take a minute or
two to work, or may require a second application after 5 minutes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Question: </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Is it unsafe to use this
product more than six times a day.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>Answer</b>: Our label recommends not to exceed
more than six time per day because typically that should be sufficient to do
the job. However, consult your physician if you have any concerns. NeoRelief is
safe and effective, but some people may have chronic ailments that require more
care than NeoRelief can provide. There may be underlying injuries or medical
conditions that require the attention or diagnosis of a health care
professional. If you do have relief from NeoRelief, then stop use and only use
when symptoms reappear<b>. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Question: </b>What if I use this product
in the way it is intended to be used and do not get full relief?</p>
<p><b>Answer: </b>Some relief is better than no
relief. We have had a few people say that they did not think the product worked
for them. Then when asked if there was any change in their level of pain, most reported going from a high level of pain to a lower level, but may still have some pain. Any reduction in pain is a positive response.
If we don’t eliminate all of the pain but reduce it to an acceptable level then
that is a step in the right direction. However, if you are not completely
satisfied, simply return the product within 30 days and we will refund your
money.</p>
<p><b>Question: </b>Can I use this product
with other conventional topical remedies?</p>
<p><b>Answer: </b>We do not recommend the use of this
product with other remedies. In most cases, other liniments will conflict with
or block the benefits of NeoRelief and cause it to perform less effectively.</p></span><p></p>

things you love? Back pain, neck pain, knee pain...it happens. We have all been
there. BioLyte Laboratories' founder, Daniel Kaline, suffered from chronic knee pain for
years. He designed NeoRelief, a 100% natural product, to help heal, not just
mask pain.
Like us, we believe many people want natural solutions that really work. We don’t want
to slather a bunch of synthetic chemicals onto ourselves or our family. And with NeoRelief you don’t have to swallow pills or apply smelly, greasy creams to get relief.






Don’t Mask the Pain, Heal it



Other pain relieving products, such as those
with menthol, camphor, and capsaicin, distract the brain by creating another
sensation (i.e. cooling or warming). NeoRelief is a synergistic blend of natural ingredients designed to quickly work on healing the
area of the pain instead of just masking it. And without synthetic chemicals! The gel
is clear, fast-acting, and it absorbs into your skin leaving it smooth and soft,
with no greasy feel. 
No smell, no stain, no sting. All while providing soothing
relief.
NeoRelief - Perfect Pain Relief
NeoRelief
increases blood flow and promotes cell regeneration to reduce bruising and speed healing time. It inhibits pain sensitive neurons for fast, long-acting pain
relief.

is listed with the FDA and is patent-pending. NeoRelief is
a Complementary and Alternative Medicine containing a
blend of 22 natural ingredients; 19 botanicals and 3 minerals. One bottle
delivers 120 doses, costing only pennies per treatment.
      


Active Ingredients: Actaea, Aesculus Hipp., Althaea, Arnica, Belladonna, Bellis, Bryonia, Calendula, Caulophyllum, Causticum, Cimicifuga, Guaiacum, Hypericum, Kali Carb., Ledum, Lithium Carb., Rhamnus Calif., Rhododendron, Rhus Tox., Ruta, Salicylicum Ac., Stellaria Med. All ingredients are HPUS and in 4X potency.
A Word from NeoRelief Formulator, Daniel Kaline
“Much of my young adult life was spent playing sports including track, football, swimming, and skiing. As a sophomore in high school, I dislocated my left knee. I spent the next year in rehab, only to dislocate it a second time. This forced me to deal with a series of radical knee operations - at last count five, over the next several years.
While I was suffering through my various recoveries, it paled in comparison to watching my father struggle with the excruciating pain of severe chronic Rheumatoid Arthritis. I found it especially difficult watching him deteriorate; each day his pain becoming increasingly worse, with traditional medicine providing very little relief.
After spending a good portion of my professional life as a therapist working in Cardio Pulmonary, I have seen a good deal of pain, much of it comparable to what my father must have been feeling. The difference was, of course, my father’s pain was personal rather than clinical. This was my dad.
It became my mission to alleviate pain and suffering.” 

What
People Say About NeoRelief

“Amazing how quickly it takes the
pain away.” “You can see the swelling go down.”“I like that it’s all natural, no
synthetics.”“The bruising, pain, redness – all
went down…”

<h3><font color=""#000066"">Our Story</font></h3>
<p>We are Cindy and Art DeVore, owners of <a href=""http://valleygreennaturals.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Valley Green Naturals</a>, a start-up company located in Virginia's beautiful Piedmont.  After 9/11, we decided to leave the Washington, D.C. area and move to Virginia's countryside.  On our little hobby farm, we raise chickens, grow our own herbs and vegetables, and make our own body and hair care products. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We got interested in making natural products several years ago after Art bought a home soap-making kit.  We had a lot of fun in the kitchen of our farm house, making products with dried herbs from our organic garden and honey from the hives located on the neighboring vineyard.  The soaps were so awesome that we began selling them locally, and they were a huge hit!  Shortly thereafter, Valley Green Naturals was born!  </p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt=""Hydration Plus Bath &amp; Shower Wash by Valley Green Naturals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://valleygreennaturals.com/shop/images/1129/?400,400,1067427529"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Long story short, we took $250 of our hard-earned money and bought ingredients to create our first lotions, creams and shampoos.  After many months of testing and perfecting recipes, as well as designing and printing all of our own labels, we launched a small product line on Etsy.  That was in the Fall of 2009.  We remember how excited we were when we made our first $100 from online sales!  Two years later, Valley Green Naturals offers over 30 skin, hair and body care products that are free of sulfates, phthalates, parabens and petrochemicals.  Oh, and one more thing... online, the company has sold over <u>$60,000</u> in products!  </p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt=""Cool Clarity Facial Care Line by Valley Green Naturals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://valleygreennaturals.com/shop/images/954/?400,400,1922378782"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Now, it's time to take Valley Green Naturals products to the masses!  Our goal is to get our affordable, body-safe and eco-friendly product line on supermarket shelves across America.  We believe that everyone should have access to natural and organic goods... and that's why Valley Green Naturals products always will be priced so that anyone who is looking to buck the chemical world can go ""au naturel!""  We're starting the push for store shelf space with our <u>#1-selling product</u>, <a href=""http://valleygreennaturals.com/shop/gardeners-glee%E2%84%A2-dry-hand-remedy-8-oz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">""Gardener's Glee!â„¢ Dry Hand Remedy""</a> which is featured in our video.</p>

<h3><font color=""#000066"">The Impact</font></h3>
<p>We know that we're big dreamers.  But hey, you can't be a successful entrepreneur without thinking big!  We also realize that placing Valley Green Naturals products on supermarket shelves across America isn't going to happen overnight.  But by starting small, with local grocery store chains, and sources like our Whole Foods Market regional office, we believe that we can make Valley Green Naturals products available to many thousands of folks.  There's a growing movement to buy local and buy natural.  Our quality products meet the needs of customers who are looking to buy safer items for themselves and their families.  Starting with local store chains also allows our company to grow along with customer demand for our products.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In addition to our brick and mortar store goal, we have been offered a vendor contract with DrugStore.com, which is owned by Walgreen's drug store chain.  At the same time that we're working to ramp up production for supermarket placement, we will be filling wholesale orders for both DrugStore.com and their sister site, Beauty.com.  </p>

<p>If, for some reason, we don't meet our funding goal, we will still go forward to cover expenses of our expansion.  Every penny counts, and our company is just teetering on the verge of growing beyond our wildest expectations.  We've already received feedback from customers whose lives have been positively affected by Valley Green Naturals products.  Just check out the customer reviews on our web site (<a href=""http://valleygreennaturals.com/testimonial/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://valleygreennaturals.com/testimonial/</a>), and you'll understand why we're so motivated to keep going, and to keep growing.  </p>

</div></div>","Our Story
We are Cindy and Art DeVore, owners of Valley Green Naturals, a start-up company located in Virginia's beautiful Piedmont.  After 9/11, we decided to leave the Washington, D.C. area and move to Virginia's countryside.  On our little hobby farm, we raise chickens, grow our own herbs and vegetables, and make our own body and hair care products. 

We got interested in making natural products several years ago after Art bought a home soap-making kit.  We had a lot of fun in the kitchen of our farm house, making products with dried herbs from our organic garden and honey from the hives located on the neighboring vineyard.  The soaps were so awesome that we began selling them locally, and they were a huge hit!  Shortly thereafter, Valley Green Naturals was born!  

Long story short, we took $250 of our hard-earned money and bought ingredients to create our first lotions, creams and shampoos.  After many months of testing and perfecting recipes, as well as designing and printing all of our own labels, we launched a small product line on Etsy.  That was in the Fall of 2009.  We remember how excited we were when we made our first $100 from online sales!  Two years later, Valley Green Naturals offers over 30 skin, hair and body care products that are free of sulfates, phthalates, parabens and petrochemicals.  Oh, and one more thing... online, the company has sold over $60,000 in products!  

Now, it's time to take Valley Green Naturals products to the masses!  Our goal is to get our affordable, body-safe and eco-friendly product line on supermarket shelves across America.  We believe that everyone should have access to natural and organic goods... and that's why Valley Green Naturals products always will be priced so that anyone who is looking to buck the chemical world can go ""au naturel!""  We're starting the push for store shelf space with our #1-selling product, ""Gardener's Glee!â„¢ Dry Hand Remedy"" which is featured in our video.


The Impact
We know that we're big dreamers.  But hey, you can't be a successful entrepreneur without thinking big!  We also realize that placing Valley Green Naturals products on supermarket shelves across America isn't going to happen overnight.  But by starting small, with local grocery store chains, and sources like our Whole Foods Market regional office, we believe that we can make Valley Green Naturals products available to many thousands of folks.  There's a growing movement to buy local and buy natural.  Our quality products meet the needs of customers who are looking to buy safer items for themselves and their families.  Starting with local store chains also allows our company to grow along with customer demand for our products.

In addition to our brick and mortar store goal, we have been offered a vendor contract with DrugStore.com, which is owned by Walgreen's drug store chain.  At the same time that we're working to ramp up production for supermarket placement, we will be filling wholesale orders for both DrugStore.com and their sister site, Beauty.com.  

If, for some reason, we don't meet our funding goal, we will still go forward to cover expenses of our expansion.  Every penny counts, and our company is just teetering on the verge of growing beyond our wildest expectations.  We've already received feedback from customers whose lives have been positively affected by Valley Green Naturals products.  Just check out the customer reviews on our web site (http://valleygreennaturals.com/testimonial/), and you'll understand why we're so motivated to keep going, and to keep growing.  


What We Need
One of the first questions we've been asked by distributors who work with store chains is, ""What's your production level?""  We always cringe at that question because until now, we've blended and bottled all $60,000 worth of products we've sold completely by hand.  Yep, that's a lot of mixing!  In order to increase our production from 1,000 units per month, to say, 5,000 units per month, we need the proper equipment and staff.  This would include purchase of additional stainless steel work tables, burners, commercial-size pots and mixers, bottling and labeling machines, pallets, packing materials, additional trademarks, and the ever-so-necessary (and required) product liability insurance.

So... what's in it for you?  
Oh gosh, we thought you'd never ask!

<p>***</p>
<p><b>The Need:</b></p>
<p>The majority of the Nepali people are poor and cannot pay for health care as there is no health insurance system.Every year patients needlessly lose their lives in an ICU in Nepal just because they cannot afford to buy essential drugs and medical equipment required for their treatment. To compound matters, in an emergency situation, health care workers will order the required equipment and medications,but then the patient’s family must leave the ICU to retrieve, pay for, and return with the supplies to ICU which costs precious minutes in a life and death situation.</p>
<p><b>The Solution:</b></p>
<p><i>Nepal Critical Care Development Foundation (NCCDF)</i>:a non-profit non-governmental organization dedicated to improving Critical Care Medicine in Nepal. Dr.Subhash Acharya is the President of the foundation.</p>
<p><i>Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH)</i>: one of the oldest and largest public hospitals in Nepal. TUTH provides high quality, relatively affordable tertiary level health services to people of lower socioeconomic status from across Nepal.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>To improve timely and equitable access to lifesaving treatments, NCCDF is pioneering the NCCDF ICU Care Box. This box is a collection of essential medical equipment and supplies located within the ICU for rapid access in an emergency situation. Patients will be asked to replenish the supplies after the emergency has passed. For those unable to afford replenishment, the supplies will be a donation for their care.</p>
<p>The NCCDF Care Boxes are initially being trialled at TUTH. The ultimate goal is to expand the scope to all public hospital ICUs in Nepal.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>* Please note that we are unable to provide a Canadian charity tax receipt for funds donated towards this project.</p>
<p>** All contributions towards this initiative are in US dollars. </p>
<br/><p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The Numbers:</b><br/></p>
<p>For an 11 bed ICU, we estimate a single Care Box will cost $2000 USD and last 3 months. Annual cost is thus $8000 USD. The foundation will check the inventory at regular intervals, monitoring depletion rate and replacing supplies as required.</p>
<p>If NCCDF is unable to collect the required funds for an ICU Care Box, the money that has been collected will be donated to the NCCDF Poor Patients Fund. The Poor Patient Fund is used to help patients afford their medications during their stay in the ICU.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>NCCDF staff continually witness needless suffering and death within Nepali ICUs due to delays or financial barriers in accessing supplies. The NCCDF Care Box is a simple, inexpensive solution to help improve patient care. Every donation counts no matter how small because even the purchase of a single syringe can make all the difference when saving someone’s life.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>THE IMPACT</b></p>
<p>Any contribution made toward saving lives are always valuable either be it monetary or non-monetary. This project is valuable in the sense that this box will help save a number of lives. We have witnessed how people have suffered needlessly and unnecessarily just because they cannot afford to buy medications in an emergency situation.</p>
<p>This is the first of the care box being implemented at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH). We are confident of the success and hope to expand the project to other public hospital ICUs in Nepal.</p>
<p>We look forward to your support.</p>

If NCCDF is unable to collect the required funds for an ICU Care Box, the money that has been collected will be donated to the NCCDF Poor Patients Fund. The Poor Patient Fund is used to help patients afford their medications during their stay in the ICU.

Summary
NCCDF staff continually witness needless suffering and death within Nepali ICUs due to delays or financial barriers in accessing supplies. The NCCDF Care Box is a simple, inexpensive solution to help improve patient care. Every donation counts no matter how small because even the purchase of a single syringe can make all the difference when saving someone’s life.

THE IMPACT
Any contribution made toward saving lives are always valuable either be it monetary or non-monetary. This project is valuable in the sense that this box will help save a number of lives. We have witnessed how people have suffered needlessly and unnecessarily just because they cannot afford to buy medications in an emergency situation.
This is the first of the care box being implemented at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH). We are confident of the success and hope to expand the project to other public hospital ICUs in Nepal.
We look forward to your support.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>This is my son, Tucker. He's amazing. Seriously. Check out his artwork. He's also heavy -- almost 90 pounds now. That might not sound like much for a young man, but lifting him multiple times on a daily basis is difficult. It's also dangerous, both for Tucker and for his caregivers. Even minor back injuries are debilitating. Plus, a caregiver back injury could result in Tucker being dropped, which could lead to significant injury for him as well.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have appealed to both private insurance and Medicaid for coverage of a lift system that will enable any caregiver, regardless of their strength, to safely transfer Tucker bed to/from wheelchair and wheelchair to/from bath. Both have denied this request saying it's not a covered benefit.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So, I searched online and applied to several grant-making organizations for financial assistance. To my delight, the First Hand Foundation came through with a grant for $4,000. The most basic, reasonable system quoted to us costs $6,621 and includes installation.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now, we just have to raise the remaining $2,621. That's where you come in.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Your donation will help us ensure that Tucker can continue to live in his own home with his family and can continue to make his incredible artwork.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we are fortunate enough to raise more than what is needed for this project, any remaining funds will be donated to charity.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>After both of us living and working in Vancouver we discovered Yoga so we decided to try it. From then on we had a new found love… Yoga. Then after travelling back home to Ireland we thought that Ireland was missing something. A pure yoga brand not just other sports wear companies trying to imitate other brands out there. What if we could bring an Irish intepretation on what we had seen on our travels? From there Arwen began..</p>

<p><strong>Arwen</strong></p>
<p>First came all our thoughts on were we should start and what should we call our new baby. Why not a Celtic name? We found Arwen completely by mistake one day after seeing many Celtic designs. The three ring symbol also known as the symbol of three rings was a symbol of the balance between male and female energy. From ancient Celtic symbols the first and last rings signified the powers of the 'male' and 'female' respectively. The middle ring signified the balance and equality of the other rings. The importance of the three interlinking Arwen rings can be interpreted that when combined the symbol implies balance, between two opposing powers in the universe. The Arwen name and symbol was just perfect for what we had been working on.</p>

<p><strong>Giving back</strong></p>
<p>When forming Arwen we always wondered how we could give back to customers and the community as originally the idea behind starting yoga classes was to meet new people and also to develop the mind and body. What if we could also let our customers decide were we could offer to give back part of our sales to worth while causes? So we decided if we could set aside 10% of all sales to give to worth while causes. We can let our customers decide and offer ideas of were we can help.

<h3>Creating Sustainable Health Care in Haiti by Training Local Haitian Doctors </h3>
<p>So many of the staff at the Lion's Gate Emergency Department in North Vancouver have fallen in love with Haiti. Each trip to this country captures us in ways we can often not even express; and so the 'Evans and Francesca' Haiti Child and Maternal Health Fundraising campaign was born. We have since partnered with <a href=""http://www.haitivillagehealth.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.haitivillagehealth.com</a> to help maximize our efforts.</p>
<p>This holiday season we would like to raise $6000 for our young Haitian doctor Billy Ysac to receive more training. Billy has been volunteering at Haiti Village Health's Sante Pou You clinic; and we would like to offer him a salary while he learns how to provide care for the Women and Children of the region during their outreach trips. </p>
<p>We need your help to bring much needed Child and Maternal Health Care to Haiti and to empower Dr. Billy Ysac and his Haitian community to care for their own through the creation of sustainable health care.</p>

<h3><font size=""3"">Long County BMX is a Bicycle Motocross track in Ludowici, Georgia. We opened in November of 2010.

<p><font size=""3"">A BMX track in this commnity offers a choice to keep the youth in the area out of trouble.

<p><font size=""3"">Improvements will consist of purchasing new soiltac that was melted from the track during the wildfire that we had in March of 2011 so that we may hold events after it rains and not have to wait days and days for the track to dry out, items for registration such as new computer and printer to make races run smoothly.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Several years ago, I swore I’d never buy another plastic baggie.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Sure enough, I found myself wanting one! I was sick of washing out plastic bags and felt guilty every time I threw one away. But I needed something small and malleable to fit in a tight spot in a lunch box. Figuring someone had already invented such a bag, I combed the Internet. I found lots of reusable bags but none of them was what I was looking for.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So I set out to create my own reusable bag that had all the features I was looking for: </span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>
<ul><li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">created with food storage in mind</span></li></ul>

<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal; font-size: 36px; line-height: 40px;"">neat-os design</span></h1>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Before my children were born, I worked in the restaurant business. Once a mom, I wanted work with more flexible hours so I took my hobby of interior design and grew it into a residential design firm that offered clients sustainable design. I learned all about environmentally friendly products and practices along the way. I also developed an appreciation for minimalism.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So when I decided to create neat-os I put these two experiences together: I wanted a clean, minimalist, eco-conscious design that I could also imagine being used by the chefs I had worked with. The clean design allowed the option to personalize the bags so anyone could put fun drawings, patterns or labels on them. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>

In the process, I discovered that the bags I'd created keep your fresh food fresh longer, which is why we are now launching a new size: the Produce Bag (see perks).</span></p>

<span style=""font-size: 36px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 40px;"">Why neat-os needs your help</span><p>Sounds good so far, right? Well I kept selling out! The manufacturer I found at first couldn't make enough bags for the demand and produced bags of inconsistent quality. I put production on hold until I could find someone who could grow with me and make a top quality product consistently. Although it cost most to have the bags made in the US, it is something I am committed to. It took a year and a half, but I finally found someone -- and in my backyard! I now have a new manufacturer in Los Angeles, 20 minutes from my home.  Supporting local economies is another tenet of the neat-os mission so I'm especially thrilled.</p>
<p>However, the minimum orders with this new manufacturer are much higher and we need more machines to make the bags. I am hoping to raise $30,000 to cover these costs.  The money will allow me to purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li>$4,000 in fabrics </li>
<li>$2,000 in zippers </li>
<li>$15,000 for local assembly and production</li>
<li>$9,000 for machines (sewing, serger, and pad printing machines)</li>

<br/><h3><br/></h3></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Why neat-os?
Several years ago, I swore I’d never buy another plastic baggie.  
Sure enough, I found myself wanting one! I was sick of washing out plastic bags and felt guilty every time I threw one away. But I needed something small and malleable to fit in a tight spot in a lunch box. Figuring someone had already invented such a bag, I combed the Internet. I found lots of reusable bags but none of them was what I was looking for.
So I set out to create my own reusable bag that had all the features I was looking for: 



created with food storage in mind
could be used hundreds of times
allowed you to see the contents inside without opening it
made with food safe materials (BPA-, PHTHALATE-, AND PVC-FREE)
easy to wash, dishwasher or washing machine safe
no velcro closure (food gets stuck in velcro)







neat-os design

Before my children were born, I worked in the restaurant business. Once a mom, I wanted work with more flexible hours so I took my hobby of interior design and grew it into a residential design firm that offered clients sustainable design. I learned all about environmentally friendly products and practices along the way. I also developed an appreciation for minimalism.  
So when I decided to create neat-os I put these two experiences together: I wanted a clean, minimalist, eco-conscious design that I could also imagine being used by the chefs I had worked with. The clean design allowed the option to personalize the bags so anyone could put fun drawings, patterns or labels on them. 

I researched and experimented, made a prototype, got feedback from my community, especially my kids, found a manufacturer, tested and experimented some more, decided on sizes and colors to offer, and opened for e-business. In the process, I discovered that the bags I'd created keep your fresh food fresh longer, which is why we are now launching a new size: the Produce Bag (see perks).




neat-os products
Two of our main goals at neat-os are global sustainability and making it easy for busy people to be more eco-conscious and do away with single use disposable items. By pledging on Indiegogo, you are joining the reusable movement or stepping up your commitment if you're already a passionate member of this movement.  
neat-os come in a variety of sizes to accommodate your needs. In addition to functional, efficient food storage, neat-os have a myriad of other uses, see lots of them here.



Snack bag, 7' x 4"": we use these for: apple slices- crackers- pencil case- nuts- half a bagel- lip balm- check book- breath mints- gym card w/energy bar- first-aid kit


Sandwich bag, 7"" x 6.5"": we use these for: hearty sandwich- markers- art supplies- herbs- cut up veggies- TSA friendly toiletries- homemade cookies- make-up 


Gallon bag, 10.5"" x 11.0"": we use these for: food storage- lettuce- freezer cooking prep- beach day- baked goods- swim suit & goggles- bulk food- travel bag for chargers- emergency supplies- seasonal decorations


Produce bag, 10.5"" x 11.0"": INTRODUCED HERE ON INDIEGOGO! This is the bag for all of your GREENS! When we found out how fresh the bags keep produce, we knew we needed an extra tall one for kale, celery, romaine, any of those tall veggies. It's also great for more general storage!





Why neat-os needs your helpSounds good so far, right? Well I kept selling out! The manufacturer I found at first couldn't make enough bags for the demand and produced bags of inconsistent quality. I put production on hold until I could find someone who could grow with me and make a top quality product consistently. Although it cost most to have the bags made in the US, it is something I am committed to. It took a year and a half, but I finally found someone -- and in my backyard! I now have a new manufacturer in Los Angeles, 20 minutes from my home.  Supporting local economies is another tenet of the neat-os mission so I'm especially thrilled.
However, the minimum orders with this new manufacturer are much higher and we need more machines to make the bags. I am hoping to raise $30,000 to cover these costs.  The money will allow me to purchase:

$4,000 in fabrics 
$2,000 in zippers 
$15,000 for local assembly and production
$9,000 for machines (sewing, serger, and pad printing machines)


neat-os Commitment 
neat-os is firmly committed to global sustainability and supporting local economies.  We believe in: 

Top quality, design and functionality in product development
Thoughtful consumption, minimal environmental impact, and supporting groups that work to clean up the environment, proud member of 1% for the Planet!
Job creation in the US and supporting local economies
Building a community around a shared outlook for a better future

Mostly, I am thrilled that neat-os makes it easier for people to be more environmentally friendly. I love hearing the many ways people are using them, so once you get your neat-os be sure to share with us on our blog or on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or Instagram!

I quickly realized IT WORKED!  I immediately saw results. By the time my second child was born, I was really impressed with my results. Then, when my last born came along, I was no longer experienced hair loss.

An all natural herbal organic hair oil that provides nourishment to your hair and prevents hair loss naturally.Let’s be honest, hair loss is not really talked about because unfortunately it can be embarrassing; instead of finding ways to improve it, we find ways to cover it up. I am speaking honestly, to share my story and my product to help others regain their hair. Our hair is a part of who we are, it tells a story. Hair has the power to dictate how others will treat us, and in turn, how we feel about ourselves. Losing hair can be devastating, as I learned. I started losing my hair due to tension to my hair follicles from certain hairstyles, mostly from wearing braids. I also notice after having my firstborn my hair loss became worst. I know I am not the only woman who has experienced losing hair during or after a pregnancy, it can be tragic. After being told by a doctor, that my hair loss was from a hormonal imbalance due to breastfeeding my eldest son and hairstyles; I decided to take matters into my own hands by figuring out a product and a regimen that worked best for me.Since using my organic hair oil, I have overcome my hair loss, and my hair grew back stronger. I applied the oil to balding spots daily and my hairline improved significantly within a few months. Regardless, if I used it 3 days a week or 7 days a week. I quickly realized IT WORKED!  I immediately saw results. By the time my second child was born, I was really impressed with my results. Then, when my last born came along, I was no longer experienced hair loss. Now, from my research, here I am years later in business telling men and women who are experiencing hair loss that it is possible to re-grow their hair. Putting Your Contributions To Work 

There is no direct cost of sales for services, since the service costs are direct cost. The donations received will be used to get the hair oil bottled, labeled and shipped to Lagos Nigeria. I am seeking $5,000.00 in total for the below items. 

Labels, 
Bottles and caps, 
Pumping machine to pump the oil into the bottles, 
Shipment fees.

<h3><b>FAQ</b></h3>
<p><b>1. What is the Serenity House and the Hansen Foundation?</b></p>
<p>- The Hansen Foundation’s purpose is to help
recovering addicts. They provide men and women with the necessary life skills to lead a productive and sober life. The Hansen Foundation owns and operates Serenity House, and
three extended-care recovery residences in Atlantic County, New Jersey. The Serenity
House is a transitional sober-living house for men and women. The residents live in a
supportive &amp; restorative, drug &amp; alcohol free environment while
learning how to be responsible members of the community. </p>
<p><b>2. How are we helping Serenity House?</b></p>
<p>- We have chosen to help the men and women of the
Serenity House, which is a step down from a half-way house. It is a sober living
environment where recovering addicts can stay for up to eighteen months. It is imperative that those in recovery learn life skills on their own and avoid triggers that may cause a relapse during the process.  We are trying our best to raise any kind of money to help these men and women. We have different levels of goals we plan to reach throughout the process.</p>
<p><b>3. What are the donations going towards?</b></p>
<p>- We have chosen to use any kinds of donations to
help build blessing bags for these men and women. A blessing bag is something
we can personally give these men and women through the help of the foundation. We have
contacted the women who created this foundation, Jennifer Hansen, to see what
these women really need. Our ultimate goal for the blessing bags is to give
around 42 beds brand new comforters. Jennifer told us that the men and women love new bedding because it makes the environment more “homey”. We want
these men and women to be as comfortable as they can be during their brave recovery. If
we accomplish the goal of 42 brand new comforters, we are going to use
the extra donations to buy these men and women other things that they need. If we
do reach this goal, we will making another shopping trip to buy personal
hygiene items such as tooth brushes, deodorant, tooth paste, shampoo and etc.
Some of those in recovery come in with absolutely nothing, so we are looking forward
to helping them.</p>
<p><b>4. Who are we, what is our class?</b></p>
<p>- We are a full class at Richard Stockton
University. We are a class within service learning which gives us the
opportunity to get out in the real world, take direct or indirect action in
national or community service. Our class is Rhetoric of Social Media, which is
teaching us different ways to use Rhetoric through social media platforms. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>5. Why are we doing this project?</b></p>
<p>- As a class, we chose to help The Serenity House, a
part of Hansen Foundation. We want to be able to help local people in need with the help of your donations. These men and women are trying to regain control of their lives and The Serenity House can use some help from us in the process. Many people can relate to this situation through addiction
within their family, friends, or even a past addiction themselves. </p>
<p><b>6. What is Richard Stockton University? </b></p>
<p>- We are New Jersey’s distinctive public college located in South Jersey. We have over eight thousand full and part time
students and are ranked top tier of the Best Regional Colleges and Universities
of the North (America’s Best Colleges for 2015) by U.S News and World Report. </p>
<p><b>7. What are our goals during this campaign? </b></p>
<p>- Our first goal is to raise 500 dollars for the
blessing bags for these men and women. We plan to do a shopping trip so we can help out
as many of these men and women as possible. We want to make sure we have enough bedding
to include everyone in the house. Our second goal is to try to gain sponsorship by
a chain restaurant around the area. We are going to try to ask for any donations they might be willing to give the Hansen Foundation. Our
ultimate goal, which we hope to achieve, is to get Stockton involved. We are
going to try our best, knowing that we may not succeed at this, to get a scholarship for a deserving man or woman in the foundation. We want to
see these men and women succeed in their recovery and in life after they leave the
house. <br/></p>

<div class=""text_exposed_show"">Silvina is a 44-year-old woman who was diagnosed with bladder cancer from July 2011. Since she was diagnosed with cancer last summer,she, her husband, her children (educated through our sponsorship program) have suffered the unthinkable and surprisingly quiet, resigned to a tragic end. Only after much suffering her husband, Job Mwarumba, asked us for help. Immediately we donated 1000 euro (500 Children of Africa and 500 Maisha Safi) to allow the immediate admission of Silvina in Aga Khan Hospital(Mombasa), which very quickly raised up to 2,000 euros before she could leave the hospital.</div>

<div class=""text_exposed_show""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">We have estimated, along with the doctors, that the total amount will be 4,000/5,000 Euros, considerably better than  the total they proposed us in KENYA and with the hope that in this way she could have more oportunity to be saved.<br/><br/>However, both the Children of Africa Maisha Safi, are very small and young organisations, and will not be able to cover all these expenses.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Warren Ballpark established in 1909 and located in historic Bisbee, Arizona, is arguably the oldest continuously used ballpark in the nation.  Its 103 years of history has taken its toll. The ballpark is owned by the Bisbee School District which is increasingly strapped for funds. The Friends of Warren Ballpark is a non-profit organization whose mission is to partner with the district to raise funds to maintain this historic treasure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to this Indiegogo campaign, the Friends will host the 4<sup>th</sup> Copper City Classic Vintage Base Ball tournament fundraiser on April 6 and 7, 2013. This year the tournament celebrates “the Tour to End All Tours” major league baseball’s 1913-14 tour that stopped over in Bisbee. The Bisbee Black Sox, the local vintage base ball team, will play other teams wearing old-style uniforms and playing by1860 rules. Donate and receive tickets to the tournament.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From its earliest days as a baseball field, Warren Ballpark has hosted high school teams, semi pro teams, outlaw teams, minor league teams and visiting major league teams. In 1937, the original wooden stands built in 1909 were demolished and the grandstands used today were constructed by the WPA. The first game played here to dedicate the new grandstands April 6, 1937 was between the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox. Many notable coaches and players have stepped onto its field as barnstorming big leaguers or as minor league players hoping to make their way up to the “Big Show.” Notable players and coaches such as Charlie Metro, Frank Lucchesi, Lefty Phillips, Billie Martin, Earl Wilson, Roy Partee, Clarence Maddern, Bert Shepard and Clint Courtney, played or coached at Warren Ballpark to name only a few.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is growing recognition, by Bisbee leaders, the city visitor’s center and historians, of the ballpark’s significance in the history of Bisbee and the history of baseball. Warren Ballpark is listed in Digital Ballparks.com. It is referenced in baseball-research.com a site maintained by the Society of American Baseball Research and featured in many magazines such as American Profiles. This beloved community landmark continues to be used year round by both the school and the public for sporting, cultural, and community events. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If there really are ghosts of baseball players past who return to play out their glory days on a field of dreams, this is the place they return to: the REAL Field of Dreams.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>We need your help to address one of the ballpark’s most critical needs, replacement of aging, unsanitary and dilapidated restrooms with free-standing, multiple stall, ADA compliant, water efficient public restrooms designed to harmonize with the historic character of the grandstands. Replacement of the restrooms is critical for the following reasons:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The current restrooms, located under the grandstand, are 75 years old and in desperate need of replacement. </li>
<li>The men’s restroom presents a health hazard as it lacks a sink and the urinal is currently inoperable.</li>
<li>The women’s restroom is also antiquated and deteriorated and can’t be reached using a wheelchair due to steep steps and its location behind the batting cages.</li>
<li>Replacing the existing plumbing located under the historic grandstands could compromise the historic character of the grandstands thus replacing these unsanitary restrooms with free-standing restrooms supports conservation of the historic grandstands.</li>
<li>The new restrooms will also replace deteriorated single stall football restrooms.</li>
<li>The current restrooms are inadequate for crowds that attend various public events.</li>
<li>The school district lacks the funds to maintain this historic park.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Warren Ballpark is still used by high school baseball and football teams, little league, semi-pro baseball and for many community events such as the Vintage Base Ball tournament, the Blues Festival and the Cancer Race for the Cure. It’s also increasingly seen as a valued tourist attraction. The aging, inadequate public restrooms on both the baseball and football side are limiting its value as a community resource. Your donation will help ensure that our beloved park remains a community and national treasure for another 103-years.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>With this campaign the Friends are trying to raise $6000 to be used to meet matching funds requirements for grant applications. $6000 is a modest goal towards meeting the overall $95,000 cost of replacing the aging restrooms at Warren Ballpark.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Friends would be honored to receive any level of tax-deductible donation that you are comfortable giving.  </li>
<li>Second, and of equal importance, we would greatly appreciate it if you would share this email with your friends. You may be in contact with folks who are unaware of our venerable ballpark but share our interest in baseball history and preserving a ballpark of historic significance.</li>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q1 - How does the Age-Defying Laser compare to the anti-aging products that I am already using? </strong>   <br/>A1 - The Fanci Belle uses the same non-ablative fractional laser technology previously available through dermatologists.

By using the Fanci Belle several minutes a day, you can expect to see visible improvement in as few as 4 weeks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q2 - When can I expect to first see results?    </strong><br/>A2 - You should start to see visible results like smoother skin in as few as 4 weeks, followed by fewer lines and wrinkles occurring a few weeks after the full 12-week course of treatment. As for how many treatments you need before you can see amazing results, it depends how extensive the changes are, deep wrinkles various from a little pigment or a little acne scarring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q3 - What are the possible side effects when using the Fanci Belle?    </strong><br/>A3 - The treatment involves no harsh chemicals or acids and there is no recovery time. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q5 - Is there anyone who should not use the Fanci Belle?    </strong><br/>A5 - The Fanci Belle is appropriate for all skin types. Do not use if you are under the age of 18, and do not allow children to play with or use this device.

<p><b>David Needs A Rustbucket Car … </b></p>
<p>I have a friend with a rare form of cancer that
affects his eyes, called <i>Von Hipple Lanau Syndrome</i>.  Tumors grow;
some benign, some cancerous, but all must be surgically removed.  It is a
hereditary disease that can skip generations, and now David has it.  His
wife – we’ll just call her L – asked me if I knew any way to help David raise
some money for a rustbucket car. </p>
<p>Nothing fancy.  A clunker.  They have
always both lived close to their jobs, so had no need for one – but now David
has to make a 160-mile round trip to get his treatments.  He can still
drive because the treatment is currently only in a single eye.  He took
the bus for his first visit.  Impossible.  I spoke with David about
it and he was adamant that he did not want to let anyone know and he didn’t
want to be a burden or a charity case. </p>
<p>I told him okay, but I told L that I could do
whatever I wanted with regard to raising money and I will.  This is why
I’ve come to you.  If only 52 people threw in 50 bucks, he’d have
enough.  I thank you for taking the time to allow me to help a man who is
too stubborn to let people help him.  He’s a really, really good
man.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We need around $2,600 U.S. so that they can find a
clunker car to get David to and from his treatments.  All the funds will
go directly to him and his wife.</p>
<p>I am an indie author, so if you donate $50 to $99.00,
I will personally email you an eBook of your choice from my library of 13
books.  Eric A. Shelman - Find me at all online bookstores.  (Now, if you’re thinking that because I’m an
author, I should be able to afford it myself – the word “indie” is the clue … I
would if I could – that’s no lie.)</p>
<p>Donate $100.00 or more and I'll personally sign and
mail you a copy of any one of my books or novels!  If we do not reach our goal, all money goes back to the donors - I don't want to complicate it, and as I said - he's reluctant.  I love the guy.  He's the kind of person we could use
more of in this world.</p>
<p><b>The Impact You Can Have ...</b></p>
<p>Just making the difference in
one man's life - making sure he knows that friends - and often strangers - care
about what happens to him.</p>
<p><b>It's Hard … you can make it
easier.</b></p>
<p>It's hard to keep a positive attitude when things go
this wrong, particularly with a syndrome like David's … you can't fight
genetics.  I want him to see the beauty of the human race and I want him
to get well - and get to his distant treatments on time.</p>

Now some people think that Scoliosis is not that big of deal, but in some cases, like my daughter, it is huge. My daughter has had Scoliosis since she was fifteen. She is now nineteen. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>WHAT IS SCOLIOSIS</u></strong></p>
<p>For anyone that does not know what Scolioisi is, let me try to explain in short term. The vast majority of people with this condition are not expected to require treatment. The problem is we do not know who will get it, why they get it, which will progress, or how far they will progress. Each year scoliosis patients make more than 600,000 visits to private physician offices, and an estimated 30,000 children are put into a brace for scoliosis, while 38,000 patients undergo spinal fusion surgery.  Despite physicians trying to treat this spinal deformity for centuries, 85% of the cases are classified as idiopathic. Consequently, a scoliosis patient's life is exacerbated by many unknowns, and treatments therefore that are often ineffective, invasive, and/or costly. Scoliosis patients also have increased health risks due to frequent x-ray exposure. Scoliosis is a multifactorial disorder, which requires multidisciplinary research and treatment. There is no cure and doctors do not know the cause of it. It is more common in girls then boys. It is a medical condition in which a person's spine is curved from side to side. Although it is a complex three-dimensional deformity, on an X-ray, viewed from the rear, the spine of an individual with scoliosis may look more like an ""S"" or a ""C"" than a straight line. Some severe cases of scoliosis can lead to diminishing lung capacity, putting pressure on the heart, and restricting physical activities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>KELSI'S STORY</u></strong></p>
<p>That is where my daughter comes in. Since she was fifteen she has had two surgeries, which for most scoliosis patients, one is rare. The first surgery they put one bar and five screws in her spine to make her spine straight because it was so curved it was effecting her breathing. On that surgery she had slight nerve damage in her right leg and was in a wheel chair for awhile but with hard work and months of physical therapy, came out okay, so we thought. Some of the screws did not want to fuse(stay in the spine and hold the bar into place) so they had to go back in for a second surgery. On this surgery they decided to put two more bars in and 24 more screws into her spine to help hold everything where it was supposed to be. She went thru more physical therapy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>YOUR HELP</u></strong></p>
<p>This is where you come in. Now at nineteen, three bars and 29 screws later and having alot of infections from the bars, she now needs a third surgery!!  Medicine is not working! So they want to go back in and take out some bars and screws and clean out the infection,   still not sure if the infection will continue to spread!  We are hopeful that we can hold off until May for her to have the surgery and her family and friends are reaching out to the public to ask for assistance in raising money to help pay for the numerous medical expenses that come along with this.  </p>

</h3>
<p>I am a single, working mom with one 12-year-old daughter who came home via adoption about five months ago. She has had a lot of grief and loss issues to work through since arriving -- including having difficult memories triggered from the very distant past. Her therapist and doctors are currently recommending more intensive therapy. Unfortunately, insurance has covered none of her therapy thus far, and the finances are more than I can afford to pay. But, I want her to get the best help that she can to have the most opportunity for healing.</p>

<p>In 2009, at the age of 29, my friend Cavell Bockting was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer. I was heartbroken, as I watched my childhood friend undergo the long grueling process of a double mastectomy, chemotherapy, and reconstructive surgery. Nevertheless, Cavell was determined and fought ruthlessly against cancer. Even when she knew she was going to lose all of her hair, she didn’t let cancer get the best of her. Cavell bravely had the last laugh by cutting her hair into a Mohawk. Cavell was a fighter and never complained as her friends and family nursed her back to health.</p>
<p>A few years later, with her newfound health, Cavell wanted to fulfill one of her dreams. Leaving her hometown of Arlington, VA, Cavell moved to Denver, Colorado to start a new chapter in her life. Anyone ever affected by disease knows it has the unfortunate ability to constantly remind you life is too short, so live it to the fullest. Once settled, she was preparing to go to school for nursing because Cavell wanted to help other cancer patients win their battles.</p>
<p>This past month, May 15, 2013, Cavell was hit with devastating news once again. Cavell has been diagnosed with lymph node cancer.  On June 10th, Cavell went under the knife again. Thankfully, surgery was successful but Cavell still has a long battle in front of her and I want to help make it as painless as possible.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT SHE NEEDS</strong></p>
<p>I am asking for $5,000 as a starting point to help Cavell during this battle. Cancer is expensive and with her new job, Cavell doesn’t have the sick time or vacation to help her with her recovery. The money raised will go towards mounting medical bills, prescriptions, and of course the much needed blood orange sorbet after chemotherapy. If any money is left over, it will be applied to Cavell’s nursing education.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>If cancer or any other disease has ever affected you or your loved ones, you know the power of the kindness of strangers. You will get the gratification of helping Cavell through her toughest times. Every dollar makes a difference and will help Cavell focus on what is most important, regaining her health.</p>
<p><strong>IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Anyone that knows Cavell, knows she is an amazing caretaker and a loyal friend.  Nobody deserves to go through this ever, especially twice. Please join me in helping her fight cancer again. Her family needs her, especially her adorable dogs, Remy and Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
