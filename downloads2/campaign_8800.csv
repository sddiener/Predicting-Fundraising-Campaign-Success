<h2>The Dinner Table Epics are Just The Beginning!</h2>
<p>Science Fiction, Steampunk, Modern Urban, Zombies, Horror, Pirates, Imperial Chinese Era Warfare, Robots, Post-Apocalyptic, Cute Pet Worlds.  It's all coming soon, and you will have a chance to choose from any theme you like!</p>
<h2><strong>What do you mean by $1000 worth of graphics for $20?</strong></h2>
<p>Pro quality custom graphics take many many hours to produce.  128x128 pixel art tiles can take a couple hours <em>each </em>to assemble pixel-by-pixel.  Our studio list rate for such tiles is $9 each.  If we sold 100 of them on rush delivery with commercial rights, it could very well add up to $1000 to do custom tiles.  But we're making exactly the same graphics at the same or better quality available in our shop for $20 during our campaign.</p>
<h2>Here's how it works.</h2>
<p>We are going to use the funds we raise to produce packages of creatives (what we'll call ""packs"") consisting of sets of graphics, audio effects, Flash/HTML5/PHP source, animations, music tracks, sets of pixel art tiles, etc.  <br/><br/>Each pack will be designed to fit a particular need.  For example, if you are creating a fantasy adventure game with pixel art graphics, you may find a pack of pixel art tiles including terrains, animated monsters, animated player characters, buildings, trees, fences, lava craters, etc.  When you buy that pack, you will be able to drop those graphics right into your game and start playtesting.<br/><br/>Each pack will be licensed by SKYPRO on a non-exclusive no-royalty no-compete commercial basis.  SKYPRO will retain copyright, trademark rights and ownership of the graphics and other materials in each pack.<br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Commercial means you will have the right to use the graphics in any kind of project:  commercial, non-commercial, academic, whatever.  You can also resize, modify, composite, munge, puree and stir them too.  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>No-compete means you can't re-sell or sublicense the packs themselves to a third party.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Non-exclusive means multiple developers will be able to use the same packs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>No-royalty means even if you make money on your project, you will not be required to pay any percentage of your earnings to SKYPRO.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>The trade-off here is pretty simple.  You will get professional-quality graphics at a ridiculously low price.  In exchange, we give you non-exclusive rights to the graphics themselves, as other developers may be using them in their own projects too.<br/><br/>We plan to produce hundreds of graphics packs on an ongoing basis, so there will always be something new, and therefore you will always have a wide selection to choose from.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Dinner Table Epics Graphics Store</h2>
<p>Once our packs are released, we will be opening a new store where creative professionals will be able to find and buy packs in the future under the exact same terms and for the same ridiculously low prices.<br/><br/>In the store, our basic pricing formula is to offer packs that would normally be $1000 worth of custom art services for $50 each.</p>
<p>For color illustration work (characters, environments, title screens, book covers, etc.) you will get two full pages (eight million square pixels) of illustrations, up to 70 individual designs, for $50. <br/><br/>For pixel art, you will get 200 32x32 frames/sprites/tiles or 100 128x128 frames/sprites/tiles for $50.  Pennies for a sprite?  Yep.</p>
<h2>The Store Will Help All Independent Creative Professionals</h2>
<p>By making a contribution, you are helping to create a great resource for all kinds of independent authors, developers and producers.</p>
<p>Heavy Cat Studios will use all contributed funds to produce more materials, more art and more cool stuff for you to use.  We're always coming up with something new!  And you will have access to it all for a tiny fraction of what it would cost to commission each illustration as a custom work.</p>
<h2>However, it gets even <em>better! </em>
</h2>
<p>During our IndieGoGo campaign, if you help us start our project off by making a contribution for a pack, you will get an additional 60% off, making your packs only $20 each.  That's <strong>98% off our list rates</strong>.  Three professionally illustrated game characters for a dollar?  Yep.</p>

<p>The Forge is home to a large group of artists from all backgrounds and mediums: cinematographers, photographers, producers, directors, musicians, illustrators, dancers, inventors, writers, performers, editors, designers, and more. </p>
<p>We are surrounded by friends and artists who need space like ours on a regular basis. Our studios and lofts are available for rent as a means to supplement building and operation costs. Whether it be for photo or video shoots, meetings or workshops, our space is in demand every day. Any income that the studio makes goes directly back into studio costs and improvements. </p>
<p>We create to live and live to create. We are trying to strengthen, build, and expand our team and community, and the Forge is our clubhouse. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p>
<p>It is time to take the Forge to the next level. Our colleagues, friends and associates want the same thing we do: a place to produce work. The better our amenities are, the more efficiently we operate and freely we produce. With your help, we will acquire the necessary means to function as a multi-media production house - concrete and virtual, where creatives make, study, share, experiment, network, and evolve.</p>
<p>Our ability to function and facilitate quality productions in-house are limited by a lack of basic resources a studio should have: professional light and sound gear, proper storage to organize our set walls, props and costumes; we need a PA system so we can host more performances and art events; sound control so we can record audio for video shoots and recording sessions; and an interactive website that can host all of the content produced at the Forge. </p>
<p>Here's a detailed breakdown of what we need:</p>

The Forge is home to a large group of artists from all backgrounds and mediums: cinematographers, photographers, producers, directors, musicians, illustrators, dancers, inventors, writers, performers, editors, designers, and more. 
We are surrounded by friends and artists who need space like ours on a regular basis. Our studios and lofts are available for rent as a means to supplement building and operation costs. Whether it be for photo or video shoots, meetings or workshops, our space is in demand every day. Any income that the studio makes goes directly back into studio costs and improvements. 
We create to live and live to create. We are trying to strengthen, build, and expand our team and community, and the Forge is our clubhouse. 
WHAT WE NEED
It is time to take the Forge to the next level. Our colleagues, friends and associates want the same thing we do: a place to produce work. The better our amenities are, the more efficiently we operate and freely we produce. With your help, we will acquire the necessary means to function as a multi-media production house - concrete and virtual, where creatives make, study, share, experiment, network, and evolve.
Our ability to function and facilitate quality productions in-house are limited by a lack of basic resources a studio should have: professional light and sound gear, proper storage to organize our set walls, props and costumes; we need a PA system so we can host more performances and art events; sound control so we can record audio for video shoots and recording sessions; and an interactive website that can host all of the content produced at the Forge. 
Here's a detailed breakdown of what we need:
$30,000 studio build out: sliding partition, mixing room, office, prop room, storage, deck, lighting grid, doors, windows, sound proofing, carpet, insulation/padding, bass traps, curtains, hardwood flooring, trim, lumber, hardware, stall dividers, mirrors, bathroom vent, towel dispensers, bins, makeup station, church pews, awnings, garage door opener, back perimeter fence, back ally gate, trellis, front perimeter fence, side barn doors, front ally gate, service ramp to side walk, security gate for driveway…
$23,000 studio gear: computer, camera, mixer, speakers, monitors, stereo, mics, headphones, cables, plugins, adapters, hot lights, strobes, stands, rollers, sand, dolly, jib…
$7,000 new website: design, development, programming and up-keep. 
Donations that come to us through paypal actually transfer immediately. This allows us to actively work and progress as we are raising funds. Contributors will see the fruits of their generosity as we document our progress each step of the way.

<h3><strong>By Seattle Rogue CORE</strong></h3>
<p>In 2012, Seattle debuted in the Circle Of Regional Effigies (CORE) at <a href=""http://burningman.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Burning Man</a> with Tendrillar Woods. This large-scale, whimsical installation enjoyed tremendous success at our regional burn, Critical, and on the playa. It amused nearly sixty thousand participants; was immortalized in the satellite <a href=""http://news.discovery.com/adventure/outdoor-activities/burning-man-wins-2012-top-satellite-pic-130111.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2012 Image Of the Year</a>; and went aflame in the largest intentional simultaneous burn in history along with 33 effigies from all over the globe. </p>
<p><img alt=""Tendrillar Woods at Burning Man 2012, with Man in background"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img834.imageshack.us/img834/3913/42seacore2012atburningm.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Tendrillar Woods""/></p>
<p>(Tendrillar Woods at Burning Man 2012, with the Man in background - photo by Michael Holden)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This year, from the team that designed Tendrillar Woods, we deliver <strong>POSIWID: The Purpose of Seattle Is What It Does</strong> - a three-tier, interactive construct comprised of a labyrinth abounding with surprise twists, gadgetry and intriguing chiaroscuro projections; a midlevel balcony containing a control panel; and an observation podium offering a panoramic vista. Although regionally selected by public vote, our proposal was not accepted into the CORE, deemed as insufficiently ""tied to our region's recognizable structures"". Yet, the consensus among our Seattle community remained unchanged: POSIWID is the vision we identify with and resolve to materialize. Regional landmarks do not statically define us - our dynamic collective choices do.</p>
<p><img alt=""POSIWID Design Concept"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img199.imageshack.us/img199/9778/posidesignaerial.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""POSIWID Design Concept""/></p>
<p>(POSIWID Concept)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus, undeterred, we proceed as planned - Seattle's whimsically-named Cult of POSIWID is going rogue and forming a Nexus Of Disavowed Effigies (NODE) in alliance with other self-funded regional and individual projects at Burning Man 2013: Cargo Cult. We are also planning to make an appearance and bring some aspects of the structure to the regional burn, <a href=""http://www.criticalnw.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Critical Northwest</a>. <strong>With your support, and building on last year's success and experience, we can indulge the public with yet another compelling and engaging experience. </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Help us achieve this shared vision!</strong></h3>
<p>Based on our costs last year and the expected build materials cost and other expenditures this year, we expect that the full cost of this project (not including perk fulfillment) will be about $18,000. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Construction materials, tools and supplies</li>
<li>Workshop rental and insurance for May through September</li>
<li>Transporting the project to and from CriticalNW and to Burning Man</li>
<li>Powering light and sound at both events</li>
<li>Materials to safely burn POSIWID at Burning Man.</li>
</ul><p>With all the great art projects competing for limited funds from both BM Org and IgnitionNW, we have not received any major grants from either group this year, but we continue undaunted. Our goal is to raise about half the money through this IndieGoGo campaign and the rest through fundraisers, our silent auction, and any other local grants we can get. The rest of the goal is for fulfilling some excellent perks to show our gratitude to you! Including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom-designed, 18 Gage stainless steel laser-cut pendants</li>
<li>POSIWID mementos (heck, full maze panels even!)</li>
<li>Bask in whiskey, bacon and hugs at our private donor parties on and off playa (tickets to our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/127474324119256/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">upcoming</a> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/486056638128107/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">events</a> in June also included!)</li>
<li>Go playa tubing behind a mutant vehicle with a friend at Burning Man!</li>
</ul><p><img alt=""Pendant design"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imageshack.us/a/img829/4168/253n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Pendant design""/></p>
<p>(Pendant design)</p>
<p>If we end up short of our Indiegogo target, we will downscale the design and reroute group energy from building to fundraising. We are committed to presenting artwork that will make our community proud in any case. And your donation can ensure that we do not divest!  </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Nearly 100 people in the Seattle area are already involved in this undertaking – more than double the number from last year. And in the absence of size limitations applicable within regular CORE placement, this rogue effigy expands well beyond a 20 foot diameter. With your help, we can maintain the increased scope of this year's project and further the outreach to engage a broader public in art production. Our recruits are of diverse backgrounds and various levels of prior artistic experience: novices eager to learn a new technique and experts glad to share pearls of wisdom, Ukrainians and Brits, youngsters and grandparents. The momentum is growing to do bigger and better things, and we are determined to keep it up.</p>
<p>With our track record and degree of self-efficacy, we have high confidence in another triumphant presentation on the Playa, and we are looking to expand our horizons thereon. Our ultimate goal (beyond the scope of this campaign) is a radically inclusive, volunteer-driven community arts initiative, where everyone is encouraged to participate and our ranks continue to grow. This would be enabled by a sustainable community art space, and generate more opportunities for artistic immersion and installation art in our hometown. </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>As the title of this year's art piece suitably underscores, our purpose is what we do. And we are determined to live up to our zeal - one individual action at a time and all together. So if you share in our passion for building and strengthening community through art, and would like to see the Pacific Northwest represented at Black Rock City - contribute to this daring and rewarding DIY endeavor. We need financial contributions, but there are so many other ways to help too!</p>

<h2><em>.PROYECTO DESPERTAR.</em></h2>
<h2>Proyecto DESPERTAR (the word ""despertar"" means to awaken in Spanish) was started by two young women activists from Esmeraldas in January of 2013. It is an arts-based project that intersects social justice, community building, and popular education through the needs and experiences of the city's emerging youth leaders.</h2>
<h2>The aim of Proyecto DESPERTAR is two-fold: to empower Afroesmeraldeño youth through the exploration of their identities facilitated by a community of elders: musicians, oral historians, poets, painters, folklorists, and other cultural icons embedded in the Afro Ecuadorian community. Afroesmeraldeño elders have described the ""dying of identity and culture"" in their community as youth become less interested in their “raices” or roots and increasingly involved with organized crime and drug trafficking. This is a direct result of the structural inequalities faced by the Afroesmeraldeño youth.</h2>

<h2>Our second aim is to instill leadership skills in each of our participants through mentoring programs with elder community leaders who have dedicated their lives to furthering the afro Ecuadorian cause and are eager to pass down their knowledge and wisdom to the next generation of leaders. We are invested in training a core group of youth so that they have all of the tools necessary to become leaders within their own communities and keep the actions of their elders ongoing once they are no longer with us. There is no greater way to impact change than through a bottom-up approach, especially by tapping into the potential that lies within the youth of a community.</h2>

<h2><em>.THIS SUMMER.</em></h2>
<h2>This summer 25 youth leaders will work side-by-side with well-respected artists in the city to create a community mural depicting Esmeraldas' maroon history and cultural traditions that are slowly losing their significance with the passing of time. We are depending on the generosity of people who believe in our cause and the work that needs to be done here in Esmeraldas to make this project a reality.</h2>
<h2>Our community mural intends to bring visibility to the historical richness that has been excluded from the educational curriculum's textbooks. A history that afro Ecuadorian youth are rarely taught and that has the potential to create a counter narrative to the history that has been misconstrued by those that benefit from our exclusion.</h2>

<h2>Our community mural will pay homage to the many voices in our community that have fought hard for the ideals of equality and justice in a country that has historically marginalized afro descendents who call this land their own.

Our festival is all about community, sharing amazing artistic work in a variety of ways. You can join in on the nighttime art crawl, take an artist-led workshop, dance 
the night away to local music, raise your hand or glass at our fancy artist talks or watch artists make art live for 24 hours straight! Come play a game of chance, get lost in the magic of the unknown! WHAT'S NEW THIS YEARThis year artists working with ideas

<p>We’ve danced, we’ve reached for ourselves and now we can just be…well…who we are….present.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>The Bliss Project and R-Evolution</b></h3>
<p>R-Evolution is the
third and <b>final</b> sculpture in the
series of three monumental sculptures, The Bliss Project, by Marco Cochrane of
a woman expressing her humanity.  At 48 feet tall, R-Evolution will debut at Burning Man 2015.  <b>These sculptures are intended to demand a
change in perspective… to be catalysts for social change.  They are intended to challenge the viewer to
see past the sexual charge that has developed around the female body which has
been used for power and control, to the human being.  They are intended to de-objectify women and
inspire us all to take action to end violence against women, thus
allowing everyone to live fully and thrive. </b></p>
<p>Another collaboration with Deja Solis, R-Evolution is
different than Bliss Dance and Truth is Beauty. There is
no overt action in her expression; she is not dancing in the face of
danger, she is not reaching to meet herself and find her own truth.  In
R-Evolution, Deja explores and expresses what she feels like when she
can just be...a whole person... a woman, radiating her energy into the
world. </p>
<p>The completed sculpture
will be made of steel rod and tubing, utilizing two layers of geodesic
triangles covered by a stainless steel mesh with LED lighting effects.  Want to know more?</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>What’s Done?</b></h3>
<p>2014 was a busy year
at Bliss Dance Studios.  It started with
Marco and Deja in the studio:  using a
Pantograph – a medieval-era enlargement tool –  and starting from a ¾ life-size original,  a 15-foot clay version of R-Evolution was
built from hand using classical sculpting techniques.  The next step was to begin the second phase
enlargement to her final metal form.  </p>
<p>Last year we
set a goal to complete one-half of R-Evolution so that we could finish her in
time for Burning Man 2015.  We are
thrilled to say that with the help of hundreds of generous donors and
volunteers, we met that goal!!! </p>
<p>Here are some
pictures of the clay/moldmaking process and pieces of the interior structure completed last year…</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1340680/files/20150330200023-rev-igg.jpg?1427770823"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>What’s Next?</b></h3>
<p><b>The Sculpture</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Everything
else!  Metalwork for the second half of
R-Evolution is well underway.  We need to
complete the sculpture, paint her for rust protection, design, purchase and
install the lighting, place the mesh skin and construct the base. Additional
funding is needed to support special surprises for your discovery on the
Playa.  To bring her to Burning Man we
will need to pay for heavy equipment and trucking.  </p>
<p><b>Together We Stand</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We believe
that there should be no incidents of sexual assault at Burning Man. This place
should be safe.  Full-stop.  If any place can be, Burning Man can. If
anyone can make it happen Burners can. 
We would love the legacy of the Bliss Project to be that there were no
incidents in 2015 and on in to the future.</p>
<p>To that end,
we are also working on expanding our public activation campaign: “Together we
Stand.”  We plan to bring more wristbands
and to continue to ask those who agree to wear one to take “active
responsibility of the safety of their sister’s on the playa.”  In addition we will be working with a number
of camps to create safe spaces, all connected by 20 foot tall lighthouses,
constructed with steel rods, designating their location.  These lighthouses are intended to both raise
public awareness and to provide a safe place for those in need. To build these lighthouses, we need to purchase metal, lighting,
solar panels, motors and signs.  </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>How Can You Help?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>There are two
ways you can help:</p>
<p><b>·</b><span> 
</span><b>First,</b>
we are pleased to have been awarded a grant from Burning Man, but this does not
cover our remaining costs.  We have
launched this Indiegogo page to help us close the gap and have great perks to
offer as a show of our appreciation for your support. Please check them out and
consider donating! </p>
<p><b>·</b><span> 
</span><b>Second</b>,
you can actively participate in the Together we Stand campaign.  If your camp would like to host a lighthouse,
or if you have any thoughts on how to further expand on this concept, or you have an idea that you think will align with The Bliss Project, please
contact us.  We’d love to hear from you!</p>

<p>The story of R-Evolution and The Bliss Project began when I
was 7-years old and my best friend was a 9-year old little girl.  One day
I was told, in way too much detail for a little boy, that she had been raped
right outside of my house.  It was incomprehensible, horrible, I never
forgot, I never understood...it still haunts me.  I thought...that man
couldn't have realized my friend was a person...if he really could see her,
this wouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>I grew up in the Bay Area in the 60's and 70's, in the
philosophical revolution and turbulence of those times.  I learned to
deeply appreciate feminine energy, influence and strength…and realized that the
objectification of women imprisoned women and also men.  I also saw
first-hand that one person, or a small group of people, can start a movement
that can make a difference and change the course of history.</p>
<p>In my 20s I discovered sculpting, and in particular, the joy of
seeing and then sculpting women; of the healing energy and power that I saw
when women were not afraid...when they could be present, when they could be
themselves, speak their minds...and the heroism it takes to do this in the face
of real danger in their daily lives.  For more than 25 years I have been sculpting
women.  At first glance, they appear to be classical figurative nudes, but
they are not.  They are radically modern...revolutionary.  These
women are safe, present. Look at them. They have chosen their own expression,
so you will see the actual woman, the person, her energy and spirit.  It
is my intent that these sculptures exude this healing energy and inspire us to
take action; to finally say enough is enough.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>Risks and Challenges</b></h3>
<p>The risks and challenges with this project relate to being able to raise sufficient funds to complete the sculpture, the lighthouses and the accompanying surprises! (Which we don't want to disclose here, so as to not ruin the aforementioned surprises).</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>The Bottom Line</b></h3>
<p>Art can illuminate the human condition and be a catalyst to
social change ...My hope is to expand human consciousness and inspire men
and women to take action to end violence against women, beginning a healing
process that will make room for women’s voices, thus allowing all of us to live
fully and thrive! I am asking you to stand with us!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
In response to the creative minds that assemble short films for school, work, or fun; and after showing them to their peers the films are forgotten about. I want to re-surface and share these works. The show will consist of a series of drawings from a group of Hip Bop artists. There will be an open bar, local press coverage and street attention, a managed canvas for graffiti artists, intro to aerial lessons on the trapeze, and tasteful entertainment followed by film screenings all based around the theme of urban intellect, community and togetherness.

My Name is Noma.  The name was given to me by friends to reflect my nomadic ways. I am a traveling photographer and cultural reporter.  I travel to a region   and embrace, observe and participate in local culture for a long period of time. 
My work has brought me to 15 countries over the last few years.  Each new venture breathes new life into me and further invigorates my love of new people and places. I feel like a newborn that is constantly inundated with newness and firsts. A new place and overload the senses and make a person feel like a newborn baby. I’ve grown to love this feeling – it really makes me feel like I am alive and gives me a sense of how diverse the world really is. 




  My latest project was the Burning Man

The nomad usually enjoys the freedom of traveling with their entire life in a large backpack.  Unfortunately, it also means everything can easily be snatched away. Then one day, I was the innocent victim of crime in U.S. Losing my art, my dream, my people, my love and my self would have been bad enough, 





They were gone before they could see the light of day. I did everything I could to find what precious things I lost Yet no one else seemed to care. Because really my existence was no more significant that a spec of dust.
I wallowed in sadness and pity before I decided to refocus. I poured my energy into learning to fill the void.  I prepared to recapture the stimulus of newness.  I thought I lost everything I owned that day When I realized I had yet unlimited potential It is the moment I knew that to be nothing is really to be ANYTHING!  I've trained myself to take each step forward. That's right. It's a fresh start. 

My Nomadic worldwide adventure is about to begin anew.

Do the Impossible, FLY!
FLY - The Inspiration Book - Front CoverWe are two sisters: Liron - an architect & painter and Shira - a writer & poet. We were perplexed by the lack of humanity we saw surrounding us and refused to be sucked into the darkness, instead choosing to open our eyes and hearts to the wonders of the world! We've been working on FLY for the last year and a half by creating and producing all of its artistic elements. Join us and find the ability to FLY <3
Liron Ben Arzi & Shira Ben Arzi Flom - The Artists behind FLYOur vision and dream is to fill your senses with strength, empowerment, determination and self-fulfillment as you flick through the pages of FLY.FLY tells the personal stories of 49 extraordinary people, some are known and famous people and some are anonymous but spectacular - They are FLY's FIGURES !
Karina Chikitova - Toddler, three year old, who survived for TWELVE days and nights in remote forest surrounded by bears and wolvesEach remarkable story relates to a specific field of interest and occurred at a different period of time in history. From renaissance artists and World War 2 protesters, to modern gay rights activists and Kurdish warriors that still fight ISIS. FLY is a one-of-a-kind inspirational art book, crafted by pen & ink portraits and uplifting lyric texts, based on true extraordinary stories of people who changed the course of humanity.Each one of FLY's Figures gets 4 pages in the book:
Book Measurements: 

Length - 240 pages 

Weight - 2.6 pounds (1.2kg)

Size - 8 X 10.5 inches (20.5 X 26.5 cm)
This is our offering to humanity :)FLY consists the tales of 49 everyday heroic people who transcended the boundaries placed against them, and done the impossible.We were moved by the story of Sophia Scholl - a young woman who protested against the Nazis by painting murals. We uncovered the story of Media - a woman currently risking her life fighting for Kurdish rights against ISIS in Iraq. We learned of Karina Chikitova -a little girl who survived 11 days in the wilds of Siberia. We researched modern heroes such as gay-rights activist Brian Skerry and the first women who ever won a Nobel Prize for science, Marie Curie.As well as heroes from times gone by, such as Leonardo Da Vinci and Ludwig van Beethoven, who were both misunderstood during their lifetimes, but who nonetheless followed their creative pursuits and created timeless masterpieces. 
""Why does the eye see a thing more clearly in dreams than the imagination, when awake?"" Da Vinci
""In order to be irreplaceable one must always be different."" Coco ChanelBeing human isn't always easy. The world around us is so often full of conflict and complexity: war, famine, discrimination – and also heartache, stress, regrets and unfulfilled dreams. All of it so often leaves us feeling disillusioned and frustrated. 
Leonardo Da Vinci - Considered to be one of the greatest renaissance artists and is known for his inventions, paintings and creations in science, architecture, engineering and music. He's one of FLY's 49 Figures.Refusing to be sucked into the darkness, we decided to open our eyes and hearts to the wonders of the world; use art as a medium to touch and motivate the people around us!
""Instead of telling about the tears, tell about the moment of hapiness. Instead of recreating how they tore your dreams, you could sing the beautiful song of the heart. Tell about the moment when joy spread through your body and woke up all the sleeping.""When we heard stories of terror and tragedy we sought out stories of tremendous courage of people who transcended the boundaries placed around them. We fought the fear and degradation with celebration and inspiration;

</p><p><b>Who:</b></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name

2015 from California State University Northridge. I also received an MFA in Creative Writing in 2009 from Boise State University. Since graduating last spring, I have been
working on new art projects using a wide array of materials. I teach art at Cal

<p><b>What:</b></p>
<p>My art
investigates identity in relation to history and current events. Linking my
identity to historical events and peoples is a linear sequence, yet current
events though timely, are difficult to comprehend and relate. My work prompts
questions and critical thinking: How do knives cut from pink vinyl connect me
to stabbings in Jerusalem? How do the borders of land, religion, and identity
coincide with a small embroidery of a house in California? Do domestic, tactile
endeavors shape globalization? Does globalization speed the recession of events
into history, or make them linger? </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p>I've had a lot of interest in the cards ever since I first started. People have been asking when the set will be available to buy - many want to buy a set as a gift for their friends and loved ones! The cards have definitely aroused the strongest emotional response of all my artwork and it would be a shame not to see them produced!</p>
<p>I believe in this deck so much, Ive used my own money over the years to produce the spec of about $1500. I have no other funding sources, so if I don't reach my target amount then I'll have to hussle myself to friends and family to invest the remaining amount. I'm determined to get this project off the ground one way or another, but without support I may have to shelve the project indefinitely.</p>
</div>I believe it is necessary to help people understand how visual art/energy works and affects them in the universe. How everyone has the ability to help himself or herself succeed themselves by understanding the choices they make in everyday living.  Also assisting them to reflect on the reasons they have made those particular choices, the images in this deck are rich, unique, and profound. I know that the deeper insight a person can experience that the Tarot gives us is instrumental. By providing a happier, more focused and spiritual life. It is my belief that by using the Tarot as a tool it allows us to not only reflect on our choices in life that we've made in the past but also how we can make better choices in the now and the future. <p></p>
<p>Every day more people ask me “When is your deck coming out?” and “Please let me know when I can buy a deck!”  Well, my friends, now is your chance to help me get this project truly off the ground and running! </p>

How everyone has the ability to help himself or herself succeed themselves by understanding the choices they make in everyday living.  Also assisting them to reflect on the reasons they have made those particular choices, the images in this deck are rich, unique, and profound. I know that the deeper insight a person can experience that the Tarot gives us is instrumental. By providing a happier, more focused and spiritual life. It is my belief that by using the Tarot as a tool it allows us to not only reflect on our choices in life that we've made in the past but also how we can make better choices in the now and the future. 
Every day more people ask me “When is your deck coming out?” and “Please let me know when I can buy a deck!”  Well, my friends, now is your chance to help me get this project truly off the ground and running! 



Other Ways You Can Help

Please spread the word!  Even if you cant spare the donation for a deck, a dollar goes a long way and just letting people know what were trying to do here is so appreciated!  Tweet, post to Facebook, your Wordpress blog or any other media you have access to!  Any and all help is appreciated more than I can say on this screen.  Thank you for encouraging and supporting me",3.0,2,"2 Campaigns

I invite
you on a journey filled with new possibilities for MEDUSA and her myth. It’s a journey where MEDUSA
STEPS OUT from
behind her shadows. Six years ago I began building DIG: An Imagined
Archeo-logism, a vast, evolving sculptural
installation that addresses the myths of men, women, war, marriage, family,
ecology, death and dying. DIG has been
mounted in two exhibitions (Xiem Gallery and Kellogg Gallery). MEDUSA STEPS OUT is the
third act of DIG and, while I have been
working on this project for 6 years, this is the first time I’m asking for
support. 
Please take a minute now to watch my video and
become familiar with the project. I want to excavate Medusa and I want you to become
fellow archeologists with me. Together we will uncover her secret and not so
secret incarnations. Who she was and is historically and who she is
today. I want you to go on this journey with me and I need your help. I
need the funds to mount the project. I need this video sent to your people all
over the world. I need you to talk about it to galleries and other venues where
you may have an ear. Go on this DIG with me. Make a gift. It will help to ensure the successful mounting
of MEDUSA STEPS OUT, the final act of
this work. Every dollar is fully tax deductible.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
As young and upcoming artists, Alessandra DeLaCruz and Kennedy Yanko have been carving out their niche in the art world from Brooklyn, NY, and are ready to take the next giant leap in their careers by showing with Select Art Fair for Art Basel Miami 2012.  With 260 leading galleries participating and over 50,000 people in attendance for 2011, Art Basel Miami is one of the most highly exposed art fairs in North America. Their Basel or Bust campaign will allow both artists to exhibit their work to a much wider audience on a scale they've never been able to reach alone; exposing them to galleries, curators, collectors and other artists to draw inspiration from and launch their careers into the stratosphere.</div>
<div>
<h3>Artist Bios</h3>
<p>Kennedy Yanko is an American artist born in St.Louis, Missouri. She began showing her work publicly at the age of 15. While studying at the San Francisco Art Institute, Kennedy was introduced to New Genres Art and her work began to evolve into multi-media abstract expression, expanding her talents to include photography, collage, installation, sculpture, and live performance. She has exhibited her work in numerous venues including a solo show in 2008, participated in Social practice art with Creative Times, and has undertaken 2 residencies; 4 years with the famous Living Theater (NYC) and with Master artist Rick Lowe (founder of Project Row house, Board member of The Andy Warhol Foundation) at Atlantic Center for the Arts. Kennedy currently lives in New York City.</p>
<p>Alessandra DeLaCruz is a New York based abstract artist who focuses on process oil painting. Growing up in upstate New York, the textures of her natural surroundings heavily influence Alessandra's work. Painting since she can remember and always resourceful, DeLaCruz started trekking her 7 foot long paintings to Union Square in 2007 to start gaining a wider audience. Graduating with a Bachelors of Fine Arts from FIT in 2009, DeLaCruz has been featured in group exhibitions throughout New York, has held two solo shows, completed several private commissioned works, and has taken to the curatorial field as the Director of Exhibitions at Harmony Gallery in Stony Brook, NY, while working under Independent Curator Ombretta Agro Andruff. She is also the Principal Curator for The East African Center, a non-profit she volunteered with as an art teacher in Kenya in 2011.</p>

<h3>Fundraising Breakdown &amp; Contributor Gifts</h3>
<p>•   Exhibition fee: $4,800<br/>•   Packing Material for sold artwork in Miami: $500<br/>•   Materials &amp; Postage for campaign gifts: $400<br/>•   IndieGoGo fee: $400-500</p>
<p>Our $6,000 budget doesn't cover airfare, lodging, food or sunscreen. In true starving artist form, these things typically come later in terms of prioritizing when making our artwork. <br/><br/>For your kind patronage to the arts, you will receive a wide range of unique gifts made by US, the artists, in order to show our deep appreciation for your support. From a small square cut out of a larger handmade drawing, to beautiful hand painted coasters, to custom painted clothing or a commissioned piece, a touch of abstract art will find its way into your life for contributing to our cause.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We will use every cent of our Basel or Bust campaign money diligently in order to get ourselves to Art Basel this December. Your contributions mean taking both of our careers to the next level, and we couldn't do it without your help!</p>
<p><br/>So many artists are trying to reach out, be exposed, be seen. We are amongst them, emerging artists who have both seized opportunities and created them for ourselves. The fast paced world of art has taught us both great patience and dedication, and we're ready to prove it to the world. From creating live performance pieces to volunteering, we know what it takes to be a hard working artist and are committed to our work. Thank you for your support!</p>
<h3>Contributors Thank You</h3>
<p>To thank you, on an evening in mid-November, we and the fine folks at Culture Fix Bar &amp; Gallery on the Lower East Side will hold a Contributors Party where NYC based donors will be able to pick up or make arrangements for their gifts, mingle with the artists, friends, and enjoy drink specials after work.</p>

<h2>The Impact-</h2>
<div>   By supporting this show you aren't just supporting us as artists, you are supporting the young artists of today who create the art world of tomorrow. We want to share our ways of looking at the world. We want to instill excitement and a passion for art in everyday life. We are coming together in this space to interact with the greater LA community, to have conversations about and celebrations for art.</div>
<div>   This is our first show as a collective. Many of us have been previously been in group shows, made artist books, had features on websites, sold work to collectors, had interviews, and built credibility behind our work. The most important part of what we do is the fact that we are productive and hungry artists.</div>

<h2>Risks-</h2>
<div>   There aren't too many risks going into this project. We've already booked a space, have a collection of works, and have plans for how we will delegate duties between us.</div>
<div>   Since our opening will take place once the LA Art Book Fair closes at 6pm (just one block away) there is some concern that our show will become an after party.

   Hell yeah, we use real cheese curds!  No effin grated cheese at our 
camp!  And it turns out that cheese curds are our biggest expense!!!</li></ul><ul><li> <b>The Other Ingredients  </b>Potatoes, gravy,  and oil.  It costs about $2500 to make 2000 poutines.  And there's propane and other things too..</li></ul><ul><li> <b>Grosse Poutine  </b>How will you find us?  Follow our giant LED cup of yellow fries lighting up the playa sky.  </li></ul><ul><li>

 takes a lot to set up a food camp, make eating areas and decorations, 
not to mention getting all this stuff to Burning Man from Montreal.   
'nuff said.  We promise that ALL the money you contribute goes toward running the 
poutine kitchen! </li></ul><p>Our target is $2000, so please help us get there!!  </p><p><b>Our
 stretch goal is $2500 </b>to afford electric refrigeration and power!   For years, 
we've been lo-tech and spent a lot of time going to Arctica every day to
 haul back ice for our cheese coolers....  but we can always 
dream...</p><p>If you contribute, we offer you our dustiest

Notre nom définit notre objectif: servir de la poutine aux « Burners » affamés chaque soir à minuit. Mais la poutine c’est quoi?  La poutine est un plat traditionnel québécois, un délice bien gras. Pour être plus précis, il s’agit de frites parsemées de fromage en grains et le tout couvert d’une sauce brune BBQ bien chaude. Ça ne titille pas vos papilles?  Détrompez-vous : il s’agit en fait de la meilleure chose que vous aurez engloutit sur la playa.</p><p>En 2013  nous avons servi approximativement plus de 2000 poutines.  Nous visons ce nombre encore cette année, tout en rendant la visite au camp une expérience encore plus intéressante !  Mais les coûts reliés à tout ceci sont importants et impossible à compenser avec  seulement les frais de camps que nous payons personnellement. Voilà pourquoi nous avons besoin de votre aide.</p><p>Vous pouvez faire un don si vos souvenirs de dégustation de poutines stimulent votre générosité ou simplement si vous croyez en l’idée de propager les idées gastronomiques québécoises à tous nos Burners affamés.</p><p><br/>Dans les dernières années, nous avons dû arrêter les files d’attentes qui s’étendaient souvent tout autour du campement.  Nous ne voulons pas laisser personne le ventre vide! Voici ce dont nous avons besoin : <br/><br/><b>Plus d’ingrédients:</b></p><ul>
<li>Le fromage en grain est notre plus grand dépense mais il y a aussi les patates, la sauce, l’huile de friture, le gaz propane ainsi que toutes les assiettes de papier et fourchettes de bois utilisées pour le service. </li>
<li>Notre budget d’ingrédients l'an passé  était d’environ  2500$.  </li>
</ul><p><b>Un plus beau camp</b></p><ul>
<li>Le projet jouit maintenant d'une superbe réputation et popularité, nous voulons maintenant amener le projet à un niveau de maturité supérieur . Les gens attendent parfois près de deux heure pour leur poutine. Nous voulons rendre l'expérience de visiter Midnight Poutine encore plus intéressante. Nous voulons améliorer le look général du camp, ajouter de l'éclairage plus joli.</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Notre emblème ""Grosse Poutine"" ce contenant de patates frites géant qui trône à plus de 20' dans les airs, a eu la vie difficile ces dernières années. Nous voulons en faire une toute nouvelle version avec avec de belles frites géantes en 3D le tout illuminé avec de puissantes lumières LED. </span></li>
</ul><p>Grace à votre contribution, nous pourrons viser grand et nourrir d’avantage de Burners affamés cette année !  La playa de burning man a besoin d’avantage de plats réconfortants de fin de soirée!<br/><br/>Notre objectif est de 2000 $ car en combinant nos frais de camps personnels et d’autres moyens de financement, nous serons capables de combler l’augmentation des frais pour  les ingrédients et le transport des marchandises. Si nous dépassons cet objectif et atteignons 2500$, nous serons en mesure d’acquérir un réfrigérateur électrique et la génératrice électrique pour conserver notre fromage à une température parfaite. Dans le passé la gestion de la glace et des glacières pour la conservation du fromage s'est avéré tout un défi.  Soyez assurés que l’argent recueilli servira uniquement à combler les dépenses de Midnight Poutine.<br/><br/>En gratitude de votre contribution, nous avons quelques items promotionnels à l’effigie de Midnight Poutine à vous offrir (Autocollants, macarons, carte postale personnalisé et même des fourchettes à effigie de Midnight Poutine )</p><br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p></div>","Texte en français un peu plus basYes, we reached our goal.

cheese curds and topped with hot gravy!   YUM!!  Last year, 2000 hungry burners got a taste of Midnight Poutine.   It's a party every night with Québecois music, burn barrels, sexy people,  line-ups around the block and, of course, poutine!  We don't want to leave anybody hungry :)  Please help us feed more burners in 2014 by funding the best late-night party food camp on the playa!!  Your Contributions Fund
Cheese Curds 
   Hell yeah, we use real cheese curds!  No effin grated cheese at our 
camp!  And it turns out that cheese curds are our biggest expense!!! The Other Ingredients  Potatoes, gravy,  and oil.  It costs about $2500 to make 2000 poutines.  And there's propane and other things too.. Grosse Poutine  How will you find us?  Follow our giant LED cup of yellow fries lighting up the playa sky.  
Unsexy Logistics  It
 takes a lot to set up a food camp, make eating areas and decorations, 
not to mention getting all this stuff to Burning Man from Montreal.   
'nuff said.  We promise that ALL the money you contribute goes toward running the 
poutine kitchen! Our target is $2000, so please help us get there!!  Our
 stretch goal is $2500 to afford electric refrigeration and power!   For years, 
we've been lo-tech and spent a lot of time going to Arctica every day to
 haul back ice for our cheese coolers....  but we can always 
dream...If you contribute, we offer you our dustiest 
heartfelt appreciation as well as Midnight Poutine stickers, pins, 
postcard and forks because we love you! See you at home   <3 <3 <3 !!!!!!  Français :Nous sommes Midnight Poutine, un campement à Burning Man majoritairement de Montréal, Québec. Notre nom définit notre objectif: servir de la poutine aux « Burners » affamés chaque soir à minuit. Mais la poutine c’est quoi?  La poutine est un plat traditionnel québécois, un délice bien gras. Pour être plus précis, il s’agit de frites parsemées de fromage en grains et le tout couvert d’une sauce brune BBQ bien chaude. Ça ne titille pas vos papilles?  Détrompez-vous : il s’agit en fait de la meilleure chose que vous aurez engloutit sur la playa.En 2013  nous avons servi approximativement plus de 2000 poutines.  Nous visons ce nombre encore cette année, tout en rendant la visite au camp une expérience encore plus intéressante !  Mais les coûts reliés à tout ceci sont importants et impossible à compenser avec  seulement les frais de camps que nous payons personnellement. Voilà pourquoi nous avons besoin de votre aide.Vous pouvez faire un don si vos souvenirs de dégustation de poutines stimulent votre générosité ou simplement si vous croyez en l’idée de propager les idées gastronomiques québécoises à tous nos Burners affamés.Dans les dernières années, nous avons dû arrêter les files d’attentes qui s’étendaient souvent tout autour du campement.  Nous ne voulons pas laisser personne le ventre vide! Voici ce dont nous avons besoin : Plus d’ingrédients:
Le fromage en grain est notre plus grand dépense mais il y a aussi les patates, la sauce, l’huile de friture, le gaz propane ainsi que toutes les assiettes de papier et fourchettes de bois utilisées pour le service. 
Notre budget d’ingrédients l'an passé  était d’environ  2500$.  
Un plus beau camp
Le projet jouit maintenant d'une superbe réputation et popularité, nous voulons maintenant amener le projet à un niveau de maturité supérieur . Les gens attendent parfois près de deux heure pour leur poutine. Nous voulons rendre l'expérience de visiter Midnight Poutine encore plus intéressante. Nous voulons améliorer le look général du camp, ajouter de l'éclairage plus joli.
Notre emblème ""Grosse Poutine"" ce contenant de patates frites géant qui trône à plus de 20' dans les airs, a eu la vie difficile ces dernières années. Nous voulons en faire une toute nouvelle version avec avec de belles frites géantes en 3D le tout illuminé avec de puissantes lumières LED. 
Grace à votre contribution, nous pourrons viser grand et nourrir d’avantage de Burners affamés cette année !  La playa de burning man a besoin d’avantage de plats réconfortants de fin de soirée!Notre objectif est de 2000 $ car en combinant nos frais de camps personnels et d’autres moyens de financement, nous serons capables de combler l’augmentation des frais pour  les ingrédients et le transport des marchandises. Si nous dépassons cet objectif et atteignons 2500$, nous serons en mesure d’acquérir un réfrigérateur électrique et la génératrice électrique pour conserver notre fromage à une température parfaite. Dans le passé la gestion de la glace et des glacières pour la conservation du fromage s'est avéré tout un défi.  Soyez assurés que l’argent recueilli servira uniquement à combler les dépenses de Midnight Poutine.En gratitude de votre contribution, nous avons quelques items promotionnels à l’effigie de Midnight Poutine à vous offrir (Autocollants, macarons, carte postale personnalisé et même des fourchettes à effigie de Midnight Poutine )",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

</h3>
<p>TraceLaboratory was founded by G. Louise Cooper and Sarah Yasdani, who met while collaborating on a project in Paris. Cooper is performance and multi-media artist and native of suburban Detroit, who received her BA in Theatre Performance from Oakland University. Sarah Yasdani is a conceptual artist from Stockholm, Sweden, who has exhibited work in Stockholm, Paris and Reykjavik. <br/></p>
<p>While in Paris, we conceived the idea of the MM Art Biome. We thought, what if we take an empty space, a single idea, and a group of artists who have never worked together, and built a thematic micro-culture? <br/></p>
<p>The MM Art Biome will be a three-day pop-up exhibition that will be based around a single theme (Micro/Macro) and color motif (indigo). Anywhere from 15-20 artists will be invited to join us in exploring these ideas, creating works based upon them, and in building a temporary sanctuary and festival for them . <br/></p>
<p>The works exhibited can range from installation to opera, without limit. <br/></p>
<p>Rather than creating a simple, themed gallery, we seek to create an experience for both artist and viewer. We seek to create a ""biome"" in which we are all united under a single concept. A space where we can live intermingled with art. A space dedicated equally to artist and viewer, where creation can continue without limit and that line may begin to blur. <br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Where donations will go...<br/>
</h3>Just as any major event, this will require some funding behind it. Here is a run-down on where our money will be going...<br/>- Rental of the space<br/>- Utilities<br/>- Technical materials (Lighting, Projectors, Sound, etc.) <br/>- Liability Insurance<br/>- Concessions <br/>- We would love love love to help our artists pay for their materials/ the shipment of their work<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact...</h3>
<p>Your donation will go towards something much needed in our modern life. This project is an act of freedom and an act of community. The important
 thing is being able to create something out of nothing, and to do it 
together. To realize the variations that exist upon one single concept, the
 different perceptions individuals inherently have. To realize that it 
is still possible to come together, to connect on a basic level. 
Undistracted, open.<br/></p>
<p>And we do not simply want you to donate- we want you to come experience it yourself. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>How you can take part...<br/>

<h3>What's the Rabbit Hole, anyway?</h3>
<p>The Rabbit Hole started as a place for student artists to interact with each other and share their work in a welcoming, off-campus space. Over the past two years the community has grown and grown and we couldn't be more thrilled. Poets, actors, stand up comedians, spoken word artists, storytellers, literary readers, academics, essayists - students, recent grads, more established artists - everyone is welcome at our open mic. Our features also represent this diversity. We are passionate about the interplay between artists, and about providing space for underrepresented voices.</p>
<p>We are asking for $1000 to run this season, our third. While we were students we were able to get some funding from our student society, but now that we have graduated we are seeking alternate sources. Grants take time, and we won't see money until we're starting our fourth season. We are passionate about this series and so are currently funding it ourselves, on our recent grad budgets.</p>
<p>The Rabbit Hole pays its featured performers, which is something we believe strongly in. We'd like to give better honorariums and offer travel grants to visiting features. On top of those costs, we also have fees related to our website. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>The Rabbit Hole is run by three young women with a range of identities and backgrounds. Currently, we're paying for the series out of pocket - it's that important to us! </p>
<p>Our passion is getting people together to experience a range of art forms, and elevating voices of people who might not otherwise be heard because of their content or style, because of their lack of quantitative experience, or because of the identities they hold. Most of our features are at really early stages in their career. We feature a lot of queer content and radical theory. As intersectional feminists, we believe that representation is powerful and necessary. As white cis women, we know that providing a platform for artists to speak for themselves is a potent vehicle for progress.</p>
<p>Each of us hold a degree from UVic in writing, professional writing, and/or English, as well as other majors and minors. We are poets, fiction writers, and theatre artists. We volunteer our time (a lot of our time!) because we believe that artists deserve a space to meet each other, hear each other, and learn from each other - whether on stage or in the crowd. For more about us individually, please check out the bios on our website.</p>
<h3>What's the money for?</h3>
<p>We are privileged to have the Copper Owl give us their space each month, so we are not asking for money to assist in venue rental.</p>
<p>We currently pay our features $20 for a twenty minute performance. Over a season (September - April, plus a summer special), we spend about $500 on honorariums. We'd like to increase this. </p>
<p>For performances that had multiple authors, or multiple people on stage, we'd like to increase the honorarium accordingly. We'd also like to be able to invite one or two more established features per season and to pay them more professional rates. We estimate we'll need $200 to cover these extra costs.</p>
<p>So that we can continue to expand the scope of the series, we'd like to have a travel fund. To cover the costs of two out-of-town readers per season, we need $200 (round-trip ferry tickets with a vehicle, or walk on tickets plus part of hotel costs, etc). </p>
<p>Our webhosting and domain costs are over $100 a year. We did a lot of research, and this is the lowest price we can find for the services and features we need.</p>
<p>Anything else we have, we'd like to put into marketing. Posters on campuses and in the community would be great, plus paying into ads on our social media platforms. Our goal is always to increase attendance and grow the community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why though?</h3>
<p>Artists are often expected to do their job for free. But art, music, writing, performance - all of these take time, training, and talent. We believe firmly that artists should be paid for their work just like any other professional. </p>
<p>For young and emerging artists, pay is scarce and costs are high. Being able to pay our performers and readers is so meaningful for us, because we know what's gone into the pieces. A paid gig is a stepping stone for those early in their careers.</p>
<p>But we also want to expand what we're currently giving. We'd like to offer better honorariums, especially for more established artists, performers that have travelled from outside of Victoria to be with us, and collaborators (such as if a playwright has actors join them on stage, or if a piece has more than one author).</p>
<p>Beyond paying our amazing features as close to what they deserve as we can afford, we also want to provide more content for our audience. Interviews, podcasts, recordings of featured performances, and print material are all future projects we'd like to start now, with your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do you get out of this?</h3>
<p>Other than a vibrant, welcoming, thriving community of artists? Other than a space in which to hear the work young people are doing? Other than an opportunity to try out your own work in a safe, casual, semi-professional environment? Other than a few hours every month to participate completely in artistic pursuits?</p>
<p>Well, we do have perks for donations: sweet Rabbit Hole swag, tickets to an exciting party in December, eternal glory, and our gratitude.</p>
<p>Importantly, we are offering our services as experienced editors to help you polish up your own work. We have training in editing poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction, journalism, marketing copy, stage-play, screenplay, and academic writing. If you select a perk that includes the option for editing, your work will be assigned to the person with the most experience in your genre who is best suited to your needs. We'll also have some members of our Rabbit Hole community - also trained in editing and writing - available to help us out and to give you the best possible feedback.</p>
<h3>How else can you help?</h3>
<p>We know that many people in our community won't be able to contribute financially - as artists and recent grads ourselves, we understand. But you can still get involved in the campaign!</p>
<p>Please share our campaign and let others know we're fundraising. </p>
<p>Follow us on our social medias and help us spread the word on those platforms - retweets, likes, and shout-outs all help us grow our audience. Sharing the Facebook events each month makes a big difference to our attendance.</p>
<p>Attending our events is what means most to us. Braving the open mic is good for us, for you, and for everybody exposed to your work and courage. </p>
<p>Thank you for being a part of this community, contributing to it with your vibrance, talent, and passion.</p>

<h3>Montana's ""Glacier"" Museum</h3>
<p>The Hockaday Museum of Art was founded in 1968 as a local art center and has grown into the regional cultural center it is today.  The mission of the Museum is ""to enrich the cultural life of our community and region, and preserve the artistic legacy of Montana and Glacier National Park.""  Many school, group and Senior tours introduce people of all ages to Art, and outreach programs take learning directly to area schools.</p>
<p>Visitors with physical limitations must be able to use the Museum's only elevator to access either of the main floors because the wheelchair-accessible entrance is on a ""mezzanine"" level due to the construction of the historic Carnegie Library building in which it is located.  </p>
<p>The failure of the elevator means that Persons With Disabilities may not be able to see all of the exhibits, attend functions or visit the Museum at all.  The elevator must be repaired as soon as possible.</p>

spotted his picture on the wall of her friend's home and put it all together.

<p><i>“The
Doost story is surreal and abstract to me. It’s hard to put your finger on what
it’s about, but that’s the magic of it. I was drawn to this production in part
because of its exploration of the search for one’s identity. I’ve often
wondered what to believe in and this play opened up my own horizons. The Sufi
path is intriguing to me because it’s about surrender to a higher power and
being in service to others. I’ve never been a part of a play with such a unique
purpose.” –Sofia Newman</i></p>

<p><i>Somehow,
this story spoke to me as I was wrestling with this question. I have come to
realize I don’t want to ask 'what if…' anymore. I don’t want to doubt as much.
I’ve been looking for a greater sense of comfort and meaning in my life and
this play came along at just the right time. I’ve reached a point where I don’t
aim for a particular destination, but want to relish a journey instead. I still

the universe. In this play, the character of Javad is a person of few
possessions and yet he gives all that he has away. That’s something I deeply
admire, yet struggle to emulate myself. If I can surrender more of my ego

<p><i>“I
had this instant personal understanding and recognition in my soul when I read
this script. Each cast member plays multiple characters, but represents one
life force: one energy. That sort of universality of spirit and the simple
beauty in the text and poetry really resonated with me and spoke to a place of
deeper understanding within me. I was raised as a Buddhist, but have noticed
striking similarities between Buddhist and Sufi philosophies and I’ve found
myself resonating with Sufism and its sense of oneness. I'm not very religious
in the traditional sense, but would definitely consider myself to be a very
spiritual person. And that sense of spirituality stems from a deeply held
belief that we’re all the same, all one. The sense of love and acceptance

</p><div>
</div><p>Welcome to my
campaign, fellow traveler; I am excited to share the adventure of my very first
Artist in Residence. My name is <a href=""https://juliana-coles-kq1w.squarespace.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Juliana Coles</u></a>
and I am a mixed media artist creating in the High Desert of Albuquerque, New
Mexico.  I have always known the what: an artist residency in the place I
feel an ineffable pull; Morocco, a compelling crossroads of culture and
history. Port city of Tetouan is a transition place where Europe and Africa
meet. It is a new artistic frontier beckoning a tribe of artists, and I am one
of them. This isn’t just a dream: it is my destiny. And I need your help to
embark on this soul enriching residency. Join my campaign, and discover through
this art journey what can be found in a desert of secrets. </p><div>
</div><p>Artist
residencies are a common practice among artists to fully immerse themselves
into their work without daily distractions<b>. </b>I am honored to have
been accepted into the <a href=""http://greenolivearts.com/art-residency/artist-residency-marrakech-biennale-2016/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Green
Olive Arts</u></a> Artist Residency in Tetouan, North Africa, February 1-28, 2016.  I join a group of international artists to
become part of a larger whole; a band of artists and storytellers weaving a
connection between cultures. Within the
context of “Convergence,” the theme of this residency, we will uniquely
describe our various artistic disciplines through the discovery of new
palettes, imagery, and narratives, which can only be found in the medina, a
labyrinth of Moroccan culture. Our intensive collaborative adventure culminates
with train travel to the Marrakesh Biennial, a premier global art event. </p><div>

work I am a story teller weaving connections and creating relationships through
word and imagery and in this case, from my ongoing dialogue with the people and
spaces of Morocco. My work depicts archetypal signs and symbols and I look
forward to expanding my artistic vocabulary through the rich colors, history
and sacred geometry of Islamic Art and Morocco’s architecture, not dissimilar to
the adobe structures of the American Southwest Desert. I expect to complete some large pieces, but

Sharing
the Story: Desert to Desert 



Welcome to my
campaign, fellow traveler; I am excited to share the adventure of my very first
Artist in Residence. My name is Juliana Coles
and I am a mixed media artist creating in the High Desert of Albuquerque, New
Mexico.  I have always known the what: an artist residency in the place I
feel an ineffable pull; Morocco, a compelling crossroads of culture and
history. Port city of Tetouan is a transition place where Europe and Africa
meet. It is a new artistic frontier beckoning a tribe of artists, and I am one
of them. This isn’t just a dream: it is my destiny. And I need your help to
embark on this soul enriching residency. Join my campaign, and discover through
this art journey what can be found in a desert of secrets. 
Artist
residencies are a common practice among artists to fully immerse themselves
into their work without daily distractions. I am honored to have
been accepted into the Green
Olive Arts Artist Residency in Tetouan, North Africa, February 1-28, 2016.  I join a group of international artists to
become part of a larger whole; a band of artists and storytellers weaving a
connection between cultures. Within the
context of “Convergence,” the theme of this residency, we will uniquely
describe our various artistic disciplines through the discovery of new
palettes, imagery, and narratives, which can only be found in the medina, a
labyrinth of Moroccan culture. Our intensive collaborative adventure culminates
with train travel to the Marrakesh Biennial, a premier global art event. 


The
Work:  The goal of this journey is to fully immerse myself
in art practice by expressively sketching and drawing the sites and people,
documenting conversations through poetry, collecting collage items, creating visual
journal pages and then working from these notes back at the residency atelier to
begin larger mixed media paintings and drawings on paper. At the heart of my
work I am a story teller weaving connections and creating relationships through
word and imagery and in this case, from my ongoing dialogue with the people and
spaces of Morocco. My work depicts archetypal signs and symbols and I look
forward to expanding my artistic vocabulary through the rich colors, history
and sacred geometry of Islamic Art and Morocco’s architecture, not dissimilar to
the adobe structures of the American Southwest Desert. I expect to complete some large pieces, but
mainly anticipate generating a new artistic direction for when I return to my homeland
desert studio where the ongoing dialogue will continue by bringing back the
expression of another place.


The
Journey:  I
depart for Tangier on January 27th and will sketch there for three
days. On January 31st, I arrive in Tetouan for the Artist Residency
roughly an hour drive from Tangier. Our time for the next 3 weeks will be spent

<p><u><i><strong>My Project</strong></i></u> - Here goes!</p>
<p>This project is for my final degree show in June, which will then end my time at university! The reason I'm using Indiegogo is to raise funds for my final piece as I'm hoping to go out with a bang, but I won't be able to achieve my goal without some help!</p>
<p>I plan to make 1-3 giant teddy bears to act as interactive art, along side a CRT Monitor playing a film that I've made, on loop. The plush teddy bears will be larger than the average person (over 6ft tall) and anyone will be able to hug, kick, jump and relax on them over the entire run of the exhibition.</p>
<p>To create these giant teddy bears I will need a lot of cardboard/paper, fabric, stuffing, thread, weights and patience; 5 out of 6 of those will require money! Which is hopefully, where you guys come in...</p>
<p>My practice this past year has been based around the question ""Is it morally right to use animals for our own gain?"". This could mean anything, from guide dogs to help the disabled, to elephant riding for our entertainment. I have volunteered with police and domesticated dogs in England to see the differences in how they are treated. I was also lucky enough to get a bursary and extend my research further by going to Thailand. I volunteered with the mistreated dogs over there, which really changed the path I was on with my project. I was also lucky enough to spend a week with elephants, which informed my practice even further, helping me to gain research that I wouldn't have been able to attain had I only stayed in England.</p>
<p>After many months of research, the main thing that kept cropping up - time and time again - was how animals are used for human profit. To demonstrate this, for my final piece I am creating teddy bears to reflect how children use toys for their own entertainment and pleasure, before dismissing them when they are no longer of use. Whilst observing our societal relationships with animals, it was brought to light just how entitled we think we are as a species to use animals all around the world for our own gain.</p>
<p>My hope for this piece is to create an elephant, sheep and dog teddy bear - all filled with feathers, wool and generic stuffing. This is to represent another way we use animals, even if we can't see it. Once I finish making these teddies I will 'hurt' them in all the places I saw the animals hurt on my volunteering courses. </p>
<p>The degree show will run from 12th - 23rd June 2017 in the SIA Gallery, Sheffield, UK. </p>
<p>Last but not least, if for whatever reason I have leftover money from these donations, I won't be profiting! Instead, I will split the money between 3 animal charities that I have linked below:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.seashepherd.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.seashepherd.org</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.animalhopeandwellness.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.animalhopeandwellness.org</a> </p>
<p><i><u><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></u></i></p>
<p>Challenges: <br/>*Getting all three teddies finished in time - I have a very strict timetable that I am following which even allows extra time before the show if needed, but many unexpected things can happen so this is why I have said 1-3 teddies.</p>
<p>*Finding strong enough thread - I have asked many opinions from tutors and friends that have worked in the fashion industry what the best thread could be as well as the strongest stitch. I have also experimented with different threads and stitches to make sure it goes smoothly.</p>
<p>*Having things go wrong which could cause delays - I have allocated extra time for this main reason as you can never expect things to go right 100% of the time.</p>
<p>Risks: <br/>*Working from my own templates that I created - I have tested them out on smaller scales so it should work out fine as long as I factor in correct notches and seams.</p>
<p>*Being able to fit them through doors - I won't stuff the bears to be stiff so fitting them through by squeezing should work out fine.</p>
<p>*Having them break throughout the exhibition from too much interaction - I will be there with a needle and thread through out the exhibition whenever needed just incase someone does get over excited and hurts the teddies.</p>
<p><u><i><strong>A little about me</strong></i></u></p>
<p>I was born in Ascot, a town in the South of England. I have loved all types of art since primary school but I really started to thrive in Year 9 when I found my love for combining colour and 3D art. </p>
<p>At 16 years old, upon finishing secondary school, I moved into a student house in York to study a national extended diploma in art and design at college. I had the best time whilst I was there and I feel that this is where I started to find my purpose and style in art.</p>
<p>After college, I studied 3D Design: Ceramics at Staffordshire University, but sadly it wasn't the right course for me so I left after my first term, determined to find somewhere that was right for me!</p>
<p>9 months later, I enrolled on to the Fine Art course at Sheffield Hallam University, beginning again. I fell in love with the freedom they gave me to explore any medium and subject I wanted! Without this freedom I really don't think I'd be able to go into the art world like I have and for that, I am forever grateful.</p>

</div><b><h3>Ciao!  Benvenuto!</h3></b><p>We are the Iron Monkeys, and we want to teach you to blacksmith.</p><br/><p>A decade ago we started building art together, and we are celebrating our Tennaversary by doing something a little different - we are bringing a fully functional blacksmith shop to Black Rock City.</p><br/><p>(Pssss….hey you.  Hold this hammer for a minute.)</p><br/><br/><h3>What is Piazza di Ferro?</h3><p>Piazza di Ferro is a place to explore.</p><br/><p>(Thanks for holding that hammer.  Could you go put this piece of round bar in the forge? If you want gloves they are over there.)</p><br/><p>The entire Piazza will be a 95’ diameter courtyard, with the shop situated dead center. The shop  is a 30’ diameter hexagon with 10 ’tall  walls. Doors and windows will provide entry ways, line of sight and fold-out workspace which will allow people to engage with blacksmithing on a number of levels.  Additionally inside there will be racks of steels for the construction of on playa projects along with the tool of the trade: anvils, hammers, forges, chisels, cutters, trail mix, grinders, more hammers, punches, saws and safety gear.</p><br/><p>Surrounding the shop will be a community gathering space where people can sit down in the warmth of the propane flame effects, watch the activity within the shop, play with the popular Zen Fire Gardens, or simply engage with others.</p><p> </p><p><b>You too can blacksmith.</b></p><b><br/></b><p>The Iron Monkeys came together around the desire to make art with metal.  We believe that anyone can blacksmith and that is the sweaty, dirty gift we want to give this year.  </p><br/><p>(Ok.  Now we are going to taper and scroll the round bar.  Come over here by the anvil and take this hammer back.  I’ll get the piece out of the forge)</p><br/><p>To make this project happen we need tools and steel.  Lots of steel.  Your donation will help us purchase material and build the things we need to have a mobile shop. This includes making a couple of small forges, some bending tools, chisels, refurbishing hammers, setting up anvils, and making tongs.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, as awesome as we are, we don’t have the skills or time to build all the tools we need to blacksmith in the desert, so we need to purchase a lot of things.

Ciao!  Benvenuto!We are the Iron Monkeys, and we want to teach you to blacksmith.A decade ago we started building art together, and we are celebrating our Tennaversary by doing something a little different - we are bringing a fully functional blacksmith shop to Black Rock City.(Pssss….hey you.  Hold this hammer for a minute.)What is Piazza di Ferro?Piazza di Ferro is a place to explore.(Thanks for holding that hammer.  Could you go put this piece of round bar in the forge? If you want gloves they are over there.)The entire Piazza will be a 95’ diameter courtyard, with the shop situated dead center. The shop  is a 30’ diameter hexagon with 10 ’tall  walls. Doors and windows will provide entry ways, line of sight and fold-out workspace which will allow people to engage with blacksmithing on a number of levels.  Additionally inside there will be racks of steels for the construction of on playa projects along with the tool of the trade: anvils, hammers, forges, chisels, cutters, trail mix, grinders, more hammers, punches, saws and safety gear.Surrounding the shop will be a community gathering space where people can sit down in the warmth of the propane flame effects, watch the activity within the shop, play with the popular Zen Fire Gardens, or simply engage with others. You too can blacksmith.The Iron Monkeys came together around the desire to make art with metal.  We believe that anyone can blacksmith and that is the sweaty, dirty gift we want to give this year.  (Ok.  Now we are going to taper and scroll the round bar.  Come over here by the anvil and take this hammer back.  I’ll get the piece out of the forge)To make this project happen we need tools and steel.  Lots of steel.  Your donation will help us purchase material and build the things we need to have a mobile shop. This includes making a couple of small forges, some bending tools, chisels, refurbishing hammers, setting up anvils, and making tongs.Unfortunately, as awesome as we are, we don’t have the skills or time to build all the tools we need to blacksmith in the desert, so we need to purchase a lot of things. Most of our day-to-day hardware (anvils and hammers and tongs OH MY) will not be leaving the shop in Seattle.  It needs to stay and be ready for our return to regular operations.The more tools, workspace and materials we have the more people we can get into the shop to try their hand at our craft.And while the Piazza is destined for Black Rock City, we are already making plans to quite literally set up shop in Seattle and offer the citizens of our home town the same opportunity we are offering to the fine folks of Black Rock City.  At the end of Burning Man we will be in possession of a mobile blacksmithing education set-up and look forward to sharing the art of blacksmithing with as many people as possible.With all that in mind we turn to you, friends, in the hope that you might feel inspired and motivated to contribute a few dollars to our vision. We really can’t do it without you.In return, we are offering some fantastic gifts and handmade keepsakes, which will forever be a memento of your engagement in bringing bad ass artistic projects like Piazza di Ferro to life. Even a few dollars - the cost of an afternoon cup of coffee - will help our mission greatly.Grazie!There is no chance we would be celebrating a decade of Iron Monkeyness this year without the support of folks like you.  Every time we have asked our people for help you have come through in spades.  We hope that Piazza di Ferro inspires you as much as it inspires us. (Check out this beautiful scroll we made!  Thanks so much for the help.  Are you ready to learn something new?)Can’t wait to see you in the shop.

<p>I'm Riya, an 18 year old, pansexual and gender non-conforming writer, artist, and activist. Despite being young, I've found a deep passion for finding ways to raise love and awareness, both in my personal life, and in my work as in artist. About a year ago, I worked with Shameless Photography Studio as a birthday present to myself. Unbeknownst to me at the time, it would jump start a career in modeling, have me featured in Bust and People Magazine, and extend my reach as an activist and speaker. </p>
<p>Besides the entrepreneurial gains of the shoot though, I also achieved a new sense of confidence, which seemed to be contagious! Through sharing my photos, I was told my many people, especially other disabled LGBT+ youth, that it was rejuvenating to see someone like them looking and feeling beautiful, valuable, and alive.</p>
<p>As I came to talk to these people, and also reflect on my own experiences, I realized a vital piece that was missing from the representation of LGBT spectrum people. We rarely are shown in our complexities. When we are also disabled, people of color, people of size, women, lower-class, or any other marginalized identity, this is especially true. Even today, with great projects like #itgetsbetter showing us it's possible to live a happy life, we aren't shown the extent and variety of amazing personalities and experiences our community has.</p>
<p>This especially extends to history, where LGBT+ people were often closeted, erased, or not recorded and talked about as a part of our past. This felt a little harrowing, seeing as from a young age we're told our history is what makes us. This led me back to Shameless, as their vintage photography allowed us to recreate the past in the sense, and showcase our current stories to honor those of the past, and bring our spectrum and spirit to life. </p>
<p>This led me to the idea of creating a Photo Book, featuring vintage style photography and writing of people on the LGBT spectrum, that represents the complexity of their humanity in the ways they wish to show it to the world. I hope that as it did with my photo, visual representation will allow people to embrace and visualize themselves as whole people, the way they want and deserve to be seen.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The money I'm raising is to be used between three sections. About $400 goes to the models, and transportation for them. It's incredibly important to me to make sure I can share the stories of people who would be unable to expend resources and time on this project, without compensation. It's also important to me to value art, presence, stories, and emotional labor, as we value other work.</p>
<p>About $2,400 is going to shooting the models. This is to supplement the cost of three full days of shooting, to support the studio, who have consistently brought their own artistic talents, resources, and amazing spirits to the project. Shameless Photography is run by talented women entrepreneurs, with a focus on helping people achieve confidence through modeling. Carey and Sophie, the photographers I'm working with, are both passionate activists involved in the community, as well, and their passion comes through in their work.</p>
<p>The remainder of the money is going to publishing. If we reach our goal that will produce 51 books. 50 being sold online, and at LGBT+ events. The last one will be given away based on a raffle, to allow LGBT+ youth, or others who may not be able to afford a copy, access to the final project.</p>
<p>If the entire goal isn't reached, less copies will be printed initially. Alternatively, if above the goal is reached, more copies will be given away to people who couldn't otherwise access them.</p>
<p>Some perks for contributing to the project include extra photos that won't be shown in the book, poetry collections, digital copies of some of the writing (both some features in the book and others) pre-release of the book, and more beautiful art!</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The aim of this project is to increase the representation of LGBT+ people of all sorts, and the variety and complexities of our lives. Representation allows both non-LGBT+ people to see us as more fully as human beings, and for LGBT+ people to further embrace themselves and their value to the world. </div>
<div>Often times media today has a very homogenous (definition: consisting of parts all of the same kind - added for accessibility) depiction of us. They rarely expand into LGBT+ people who aren't thin, white, abled, celebrities. Even when they showcase those narratives, they often either make sexuality and gender the only part of their identity, or they erase it completely. </div>
<div>What I aim to do, with this project, is project our own stories into the world. Stories that show our sexualities and genders interplaying with many other aspects of ourselves, and our lives. I aim to celebrate the whole beings of ourselves and others who read the book. </div>
<div>Most importantly, I aim to remind LGBT+ people, especially youth, that there is, always has been, and always will be, other people with lives like their own that experience joy, love, passion, and hope within these complexities of their existence. </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The biggest risk to the project is my own disability. Because of hospital visits and chronic fatigue, working on the project has somewhat of a flexible timeline. Luckily, most of the work can be done from bed, and I'm overwhelmingly passionate about this project. I find working on it healing, and while not having an exact date, I feel confident I will release the book early next year.</p>
<p>Another risk of course, is not reaching the goal monetarily. As explained earlier, the first cut will be the number of copies initially produced. If demand allows, we can always bring the book back into production and allow more copies to be sold. If one of the other segments isn't fully covered however, I don't want to allow the people working hard on this project to go unpaid, or unrewarded for their work. I'll most likely try other ways of raising money, in person and through selling second hand clothing and my art. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't donate money, but you're interested in the project, there are other ways you can help. Sharing this fundraiser and project, through word of mouth, social media, or email is an incredible help. Indiegogo has a share button that's hoping to be used! </p>
<p>You can also like me on Facebook at Riya B, where you can contribute suggestions, and receive updates on the project! </p>

The creation of a print begins with a ‘matrix’ (eg. lino, wood, copper, zinc, aluminium or stone) with which the image is made on. Ink is then applied to the matrix and transferred to the final surface - usually paper - by applying pressure.</p><p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494587936/goujv0oc7mljcmr9egz5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Printmaking's most unique feature is its ability to produce multiples. Unlike digital or reproductive printing, there is no distinction between 'copies' or 'originals' - each impression is one and the same, as every single print within the edition is made by hand and approved by the artist.</p><p> </p><h3>What about Lithography?</h3><p>Lithography is derived from the Greek origins “<i>litho</i>” - stone, and <i>“graphy”</i> - writing. Lithography is a planographic printmaking process, which means that the image is created from the flat surface of a limestone or aluminum matrix. Unlike etching or linocut, there is no need for incision or direct physical alteration of the surface in order to create the image, as the technique is reliant upon the principle that oil and water do not mix.</p><p>Lithography was originally termed “chemical printing” by its creator, Alois Senefelder in 1798, who discovered the process after he wrote his shopping list on a slab of Bavarian limestone with a greasy crayon. After applying chemicals to the drawing, he discovered that by keeping the stone wet with a film of water, he would be able to roll a greasy ink into the drawing and thus pull multiple impressions.</p><p>Lithography became a crucial process to the printing industry. It was used initially for commercial purposes, primarily in the reproduction of manuscripts, plays and maps; and it wasn’t until 1803 that artists began to adopt the process for their own work (such as Alphonse Mucha, Toulouse Lautrec and Picasso). Lithography revolutionised the commercial printing industry with the process of offset lithography being born directly from the traditional lithography printing process. This was vital in allowing the mass distribution of printed material to the public, particularly during the 1950s and 60s. The development of digital printing – which has become ubiquitous with the 21st century, was born from the offset printing press (and thus, the lithographic medium!)</p><p>Over the years, lithography began to lose its popularity as a fine art medium, and traditional lithography started to become obsolete. Thanks to many determined printmakers – specifically June Wayne, who founded the prestigious <a href=""http://tamarind.unm.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tamarind Lithography Workshop</a> (now known as the Tamarind Institute) in 1960, lithography has re-gained its momentum and status in the printmaking world.</p><p>Due to the direct drawing process, lithographs have a very unique aesthetic that can rarely be achieved in other processes. It allows the artist to draw with the immediacy with which one might normally draw with, while also allowing the freedom of image manipulation.

Our primary goal as an institution is to foster the presence of lithography in our region, and to keep the art of the print a relevant, valuable, and appealing medium to artists, galleries and the wider community.Though Brisbane has a rich printmaking community with a number of dedicated studios, our press will be the first in the greater Brisbane area to act as publishers: approaching a curated range of artists to produce new print-based work.In addition to our focus on lithographic mediums, we also work with artists in book arts and intaglio printmaking. We are already working with artists in both publishing and contract printing, and have received overwhelming support from our community; but we need some help to keep the momentum going.In our current political climate, there are so few opportunities available (ie. zilch) that support an artistic undertaking like ours. We are reaching out to our beloved friends, family, colleagues (and your friends and families and colleagues) to assist us in building this exciting new venture. Every single person who donates (yes, everyone!) will not only be contributing to our studio and helping us to build artists’ portfolios, but will also receive a token of our gratitude. Just make sure to hit ""claim"" when donating, so we know where to send it to!    How your donations will be used:
Assisting us in securing a studio location that will not only allow us to be autonomous, but also be properly equipped and compliant; and provide a comfortable space for our artists to work in
Acquisition and re-location of our lithography press and equipment
Purchasing of studio materials, such as paper, ink, solvents, bookbinding materials, acid baths, shelving and storage
Seeking out new artists and potential buyers, including galleries and exhibiting opportunities.
Facilitating workshops in our studio, and spreading the printmaking love!
 Our GoalOur minimum goal is $2,500, but we are hoping to raise more, to really get things kickstarted –Whether you can donate $5 or $500, every little piece is valuable and will be used toward the studio in some way –  $5 will get us a crayon holder or some tusche brushes, and $500 will enable us to buy a ream of paper and a can or two of ink.  If you are unable to donate at this time (don't worry, we get it!) we would appreciate your assistance in sharing our campaign around and spreading the printmaking love! What We Do Printmaking is a unique medium classified by the transferal of ink from one surface to another. The creation of a print begins with a ‘matrix’ (eg. lino, wood, copper, zinc, aluminium or stone) with which the image is made on. Ink is then applied to the matrix and transferred to the final surface - usually paper - by applying pressure. Printmaking's most unique feature is its ability to produce multiples. Unlike digital or reproductive printing, there is no distinction between 'copies' or 'originals' - each impression is one and the same, as every single print within the edition is made by hand and approved by the artist. What about Lithography?Lithography is derived from the Greek origins “litho” - stone, and “graphy” - writing. Lithography is a planographic printmaking process, which means that the image is created from the flat surface of a limestone or aluminum matrix. Unlike etching or linocut, there is no need for incision or direct physical alteration of the surface in order to create the image, as the technique is reliant upon the principle that oil and water do not mix.Lithography was originally termed “chemical printing” by its creator, Alois Senefelder in 1798, who discovered the process after he wrote his shopping list on a slab of Bavarian limestone with a greasy crayon. After applying chemicals to the drawing, he discovered that by keeping the stone wet with a film of water, he would be able to roll a greasy ink into the drawing and thus pull multiple impressions.Lithography became a crucial process to the printing industry. It was used initially for commercial purposes, primarily in the reproduction of manuscripts, plays and maps; and it wasn’t until 1803 that artists began to adopt the process for their own work (such as Alphonse Mucha, Toulouse Lautrec and Picasso). Lithography revolutionised the commercial printing industry with the process of offset lithography being born directly from the traditional lithography printing process. This was vital in allowing the mass distribution of printed material to the public, particularly during the 1950s and 60s. The development of digital printing – which has become ubiquitous with the 21st century, was born from the offset printing press (and thus, the lithographic medium!)Over the years, lithography began to lose its popularity as a fine art medium, and traditional lithography started to become obsolete. Thanks to many determined printmakers – specifically June Wayne, who founded the prestigious Tamarind Lithography Workshop (now known as the Tamarind Institute) in 1960, lithography has re-gained its momentum and status in the printmaking world.Due to the direct drawing process, lithographs have a very unique aesthetic that can rarely be achieved in other processes. It allows the artist to draw with the immediacy with which one might normally draw with, while also allowing the freedom of image manipulation. Printmaking allows the printer to make multiples; experiment with colour, form and materials; combine imagery; and develop images to multiple dimensions.Clinton Barker Spewing Out Seeds of Faith 2016, Lithograph on Magnani cotton rag paper “Publisher of Fine Art Prints""?Collaborative printing practice allows artists to produce images in specific print mediums by working with printmakers. There are two traditional models of collaborative printmaking – publishing and contract printing. In publishing projects, a studio will invite an artist to create a new edition of original prints. The studio takes the risk of covering the material and labour costs and in exchange, retains half of the final prints for sale, distribution and exhibition. Publishing allows the studio to act as a representative of the artists, promoting, exhibiting and selling their work; and therefore benefiting both the artist and the studio.Contract printing (or 'custom' printing) is typically initiated by an artist who approaches a studio with the desire to create a series of prints in their chosen print medium. In this case, the studio only keeps a few of the prints for their own collection and exhibition, and the artist receives the entire edition.Working with a collaborative print studio has benefits for many types of artists - printmakers and non-printmakers alike. Artists who work in other mediums such as painting, drawing, sculpture, design and digital media are able to produce work in a new medium guided by the expertise of the studio printers.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are the members of the Saskatchewan Regional Burning Man group from Saskatchewan, Canada. Our region includes everyone from veteran burners to ""birgins"", to people who are interested in the Burning Man culture but haven't yet attended.</p>
<p>Last year, we were fortunate to have our art project, Burning Sheaf, included in the first Circle of Regional Effigies (CORE) project. It was a fantastic experience for everyone involved, and we're extremely excited that Saskatchewan has been accepted into the CORE project again this year!</p>
<p>SCORE 2011 was funded by people within our circle. Not only do we want to make it easier to donate this year, but we want to make it easier for people in and out of province (and country!) to support our project.</p>
<h3>What We're Doing</h3>
<p>This year's project features several themes important to Saskatchewan history -- the wild plains bison (and their disappearance), wheat and farming, and (of course) fire.</p>
<p>Bison were crucial to the survival of native peoples in the prairies of Canada, and were nearly hunted to extinction by white settlers, who supplanted the natural prairie with crops of wheat and barley. Saskatchewan is considered the wheat province, but many of the effects of farming, including the forced relocation of native tribes and the failing Indian Act, have yet to be addressed. The project's vision is to juxtapose the themes of bison and wheat, and set them on fire as a literal way of burning the stereotypes and colonial history still present in Saskatchewan today.</p>
<p>""Bison Field"" will be a twenty foot tall structure composed of environmentally friendly materials which will be burned along with <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BurningManCORE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the other CORE effigies</a> at the <a href=""http://www.burningman.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2012 Burning Man festival</a>.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We're looking for funding to help support the costs of the project -- everything from purchasing the wood and the lights to transporting the project the 2000km to the playa to making sure that our entire perimeter team can be seen in the dark  and during any dust storms (bright tshirts were integral to this last year).</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of our budgeted costs for the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood</li>
<li>Lighting</li>
<li>Community involvement</li>
<li>Transportation of the project</li>
<li>Uniforms</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens if we fundraise more than our goal? Anything raised over and above our goal goes directly back into the project. (Where before there was lighting, there is now super lighting!)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>SCORE 2011 was a great experience for Saskatchewan Burners, and was a really great way to solidfy our comparitively small community together on the playa. The 2011 project was our first community art project, and it was a great experience! It's prompted us to think about what it means to be from Saskatchewan, and how important it is to us to be able to share our art at the Burning Man festival.</p>
<p>We want to continue our representation of Saskatchewan at the CORE project by bringing our SCORE 2012 project down to the playa. We've expanded the scope and size of our project this year, and are extremely excited about seeing everything come together.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
The JumpstART Festival is an exciting platform for artists and audiences across Long Island to enjoy and celebrate creativity. We believe that improvisation and spontaneous creativity are
important for all, young and old. Our artist-facilitators are
passionate about their crafts and want to make them accessible to
you! Central to our methodology is the approach of providing the
audience with the creative agency to become artists themselves. We
want you to be a part of this, and we will make every effort in order
to ensure that it happens! We have many ideas for how we might continue this project beyond the JumpstART Festival, and are excited to explore them after this first installation.</p>

</div>","Short Summary


Becoming Our Spaces is a creative collective lead by artist Courtney
Surmanek. We are dedicated to opening up communal spaces that
encourage expressive freedom.On August 7 2015, Courtney
and her team of artist-facilitators will take part in East End Arts' JumpstART Festival in Downtown Riverhead. Becoming Our Spaces is centered around a sculptural installation of life-sized, vibrantly colored, paper mache arches. Lovingly called ""Improvisation Station"", this outdoor space will be interactive: one to play in for both young and old. A playful chorus of improvised sound, visual art making and movement will take place, activating the site at designated times. Many exciting events and happenings are abound in connection with Becoming Our
Spaces. An all-ages workshop will be held at Improvisation Station
by Thomas Manuel, Director of the LIU Post Jazz Ensemble, and visionary behind The Jazz Loft in Stony Brook. 
Becoming Our Spaces will also host a special workshop off-site with Riverside Rediscovered.
Festival-goers will be invited to join in a creative imagining
of what makes a community unique, an extension of the exercises we will exploring in
Improvisation Station. Vine & Hops on East Main Street will also be joining Becoming Our
Spaces to provide happy hour priced drinks in exchange for a spoken word poem. 
Why's It Important?Creativity is a key element in building our future and the world we want to see. However, artistic creation is something many of us let go of at an early age. Not good enough, or not born with what we perceive as ""talent"", we give up on the idea altogether. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not a good artist. It takes me hours to get a figure drawn right. The power of the arts isn't in how well you can depict something, but in the motivation behind it. What is good anyway? And if it's ""good"", is it interesting or worthwhile?Becoming Our Spaces is asking festival-goers to abandon talent for one evening. We provide the experience, all we ask is that you join us! The installation I build in the beginning will look and feel completely different by the end of the festival—covered in new paint, found objects and memories from the people who took part in the experience.

And I am back at it again. Im doing the golden shoes project in Chicago this year. 
456 people were murdered in Chicago in 2014. Recent articles state we should not be alarmed as homicide rates are flat to last year….but if you look closer at the statistics….people that were shot and wounded increased by 23% AND for 2015, the homicide rate is up from last year from 35 murders to 43 same time last year. 

Why shoes? The soles of the shoes are what separates us from the earth and these peoples souls are what we hope to honor and represent in the installation.  
Why gold? Gold is the one of the oldest and most widely accepted forms of currency. It represents so many things...from capitalism to value to history. In short, we want the color gold to remind us of that which has value (human life)…our citizens....which we are loosing to violence.   
3 GOALS
1. create awareness: we are bombarded with so much information that at times it is hard to grasp the severity of an issue….we cannot change that which we are not aware of. Our hope is to create a visual for the viewer as to what is happening in our communities...in our own back yard.
2. unite communities: a project by the people for the people. For the Golden Shoes Project-Puerto Rico we held workshops in schools, museums, community centers, halfway houses, you name it. The goal is to create bonds, connections between communities and working on a project together does just that. This project gives communities a voice and encouragement to create. We hope to do just that for the people of Chicago. 
3. honor those we lost. these people we lost to violence are not a statistic but humans…with families & friends that now live with the loss of their loved one. We are honoring those lives. We also will be holding a special workshop for family members of actual victims of violence and give them the opportunity to paint the shoes of their loved one themselves. We hope it will be a healing process for them. 
Art is not trivial. By supporting this project  you are saying art is important and can create change. You are encouraging these communities and letting them know that people outside of their community care. 
This project is not funded by any organization or corporation. It is coming to fruition through YOU and me….so WE NEED YOUR FINANCIAL SUPPORT. 
$5,000 is the goal...The money will be used for the materials necessary to do workshops such as: spray paint, glue, glitter, paint trays, paint brushes and other supporting materials such as boxes, trash bags, gloves, website costs, storage and transportation of shoes.

Creation of a whole sculptural geological era in an olde worlde â€˜greenâ€™ charity-run farm in deepest England.  A kaleidoscope of Scraptorzioc creatures, humanoids and weird, fantastic plant life will colonise wooded ravines and lakes of the Magdalen Project.

(this print is one of the perks)
 
 
Situated near the dramatic Jurassic coast of Dorset, the Magdalen Project charity runs a vast range of courses for all ages.  Visited by over 7000 people per year, it specialises in Care Farming, therapeutic effects of contact with nature and farming to disadvantaged, special needs and mental health sufferers. Sustainability is a key principle. (www.themagdalenproject.org.uk) Our transformed landscape will become a part of the whole Magdalen experience from June â€™12.
  
The Scraptorzoic Era will reveal a Lost World - a fantasy fusion of old legends and a new Eden.  Scraptorzoic creatures emerging from giant spawn, bulbous anthills swelling on tall spikes, exotic diatoms floating on ponds, gnarled, writhing growths, tribes of humanoids, skeletal steel goats, totemic constructions, monstrous insects creeping from trees; huge raptors and Hieronymus Bosch-inspired forms to delight visitors. Vibrant colour and translucency. Sci-fi and Jurassic melded. 
 
Our sculptural narrative - using retrieved materials including old farm machinery found on site - offers a magical, inspirational, epic experience for all visitors â€“ local and from further afield.

IMPACT
 

Ethos â€“ epic, creative approach to environmental issues: raising awareness of art, utilising discarded stuff around us. 
Engaging new audiences to explore diverse benefits and natural habitats of the Magdalen Project.  
Creating a vibrant, inspiring, sustainable environment, encouraging both children and adults to develop new skills, enjoy eco-adventures and develop a richer understanding of the countryside, its historical and geological heritage.  
Interactive participation, inviting young people to contribute creations through a workshop - giving them a sense of ownership over the trail.  The Scraptors will run this workshop in the summer with young people to develop pieces to add to the giant transparent spawn containing scrap embryonic creatures, which will grow as the trail develops.

<p>Malama Pono, a new series of images by photographer Britten Traughber, is scheduled to debut at Jan Brandt Gallery in Bloomington, IL on May 25th, 2013. This campaign is aimed at raising half the funds needed to produce, print, mat and frame the show. </p>
<p>Since moving to the Big Island two years ago, Britten has become friends with many resilient women, who have shared their stories with her. The images in Malama Pono are based on these stories, creative re-interpretations in which the narrator herself has often modeled for her own story. Anonymous stories, or stories told in secret, have been interpreted using models. </p>
<p>""Malama Pono"" often translates as ""It's all good"" or in this case ""Please Take Care"". It is Britten's goal that this work will celebrate the lives of the women who have so graciously trusted their stories to her, while bringing light to the often unspoken hardships and struggles of everyday life in Hawaii. </p>
<p>Through this campaign I'm aiming to raise half the cost of this show. The other half of my budget (plus travel to the mainland for the show and any unforeseen additional costs) is being covered by my two ""real"" jobs that have funded this endeavor thus far.</p>
<p>Plans are being made for future exhibits on the mainland, and any amount raised over the goal will go toward creating a traveling show specifically to be shown on the Hawaiian Islands. </p>
<p>Printing is being done locally on the Big Island. These prints will come on the plane with me to Illinois and be framed shortly before the show opens. All frames, glass and matting will be prepared ahead of time in Illinois by local businesses. After the exhibit the show will be crated and hopefully sent out to its next venue!</p>
<p>Due to the challenges of creating work on an island and presenting it thousands of miles away, I've had to get creative with materials, time and my budget. I believe in the power of this show so much. Please help me share this work with a larger audience &amp; celebrate the stories of these amazing women.  Thank you for your support! </p></div>","Malama Pono, a new series of images by photographer Britten Traughber, is scheduled to debut at Jan Brandt Gallery in Bloomington, IL on May 25th, 2013.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The DutchMill is an interactive public art piece that will represent the people, culture and art of the Netherlands at the Black Rock Arts Festival (aka Burning Man) as part of the Circle of Regional Effigies, or C.O.R.E. The project seeks to create one of the most familiar symbols of the Netherlands by errecting a large Windmill on the Playa and we feel very proud to have been accepted as a CORE project by the Black Rock Arts Foundation and given an initial grant to get started.</p>
<p>However, the amount of the grant is not enough to make this project and our dream come true! We need funding from people like you to help make this unique art piece happen.</p>
<h2>Details of the Project</h2>
<p>When people think of the Netherlands one of the most frequent symbols of the country is the windmill. The Dutch people have been embracing man of the 10 Principles of Burning Man such as Radical Inclusion, Community/Civic Responsibility, and Immediacy through working together to reclaim their country from the sea for hundreds of years. As such we feel that a Dutch Mill is the perfect representation of the Dutch Burners and a great fit for our first (of hopefully many) CORE projects.</p>
<p>The project will be designed and built through a collaboration of local Burners and Artists with the actual construction done in the US and will use donated recycled wood as much as possible. We have already partnered with the Reno CORE project and they have graciously offered to allow us to work along side them in Reno.</p>
<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>Our project will be a very unique piece on the Playa not only in that it will be a collobartion of work done in two countries, but also in the overall appearance of the piece. Rising out of the baren salt flat dessert will be a structure that is covered in brilliant colors and vibrant lights at night.

The DutchMill is an interactive public art piece that will represent the people, culture and art of the Netherlands at the Black Rock Arts Festival (aka Burning Man) as part of the Circle of Regional Effigies, or C.O.R.E. The project seeks to create one of the most familiar symbols of the Netherlands by errecting a large Windmill on the Playa and we feel very proud to have been accepted as a CORE project by the Black Rock Arts Foundation and given an initial grant to get started.
However, the amount of the grant is not enough to make this project and our dream come true! We need funding from people like you to help make this unique art piece happen.
Details of the Project
When people think of the Netherlands one of the most frequent symbols of the country is the windmill. The Dutch people have been embracing man of the 10 Principles of Burning Man such as Radical Inclusion, Community/Civic Responsibility, and Immediacy through working together to reclaim their country from the sea for hundreds of years. As such we feel that a Dutch Mill is the perfect representation of the Dutch Burners and a great fit for our first (of hopefully many) CORE projects.
The project will be designed and built through a collaboration of local Burners and Artists with the actual construction done in the US and will use donated recycled wood as much as possible. We have already partnered with the Reno CORE project and they have graciously offered to allow us to work along side them in Reno.
Appearance
Our project will be a very unique piece on the Playa not only in that it will be a collobartion of work done in two countries, but also in the overall appearance of the piece. Rising out of the baren salt flat dessert will be a structure that is covered in brilliant colors and vibrant lights at night. The outside of the piece will be covered in fabric and be strikingly different from the cutout wood and painted pieces that tradditionally mark CORE projects. This innovative decoration style will not only be unique but serves to solve one of the biggest problems of the project. How can we allow all the artists and participants in our project in the Netherlands help in decorating a piece built in the US? The fabric pieces will allow the art to be done locally and then added to the piece during assembly. The large sheets will be stretched across the panels of the base of the mill.
The structure itself will have an octagon shaped base in tradditonal style.

<font color=""c40079"">Why Performance art?</font>
</h3>
<div>
<p>Performance art is a form of art that gives the audience a direct connection with the artwork, because the artist and artwork is one. Performance art is a form of expression that is created in the here and now, leading to a intensity in the meeting between the artwork and viewer, which is different from what is created in static art or art that is experienced via a screen. The fact that the viewer becomes part of the creation process of the artwork and in some cases the artwork itself gives a unique attachment to the work. We believe that performance art, when it is experienced, can contribute to an understanding of how art is created. This may be because performance art gives an insight in to the artist’s energy and mind.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3><font color=""c40079"">Why in Nature?</font></h3>
<p>The nature in Norway is unique and beautiful, but for some of us who live between the hills and mountains, it has become mundane. A performance artist can either help us experience nature anew or intensify the moment. He or she can create a moment that perceptually lasts longer. Our attention has been focused, just like when we look at a beautiful sunset or a unique play of light. It causes us to linger a little longer at a spot seen many times before. Because a human has created the moment, it might help us to think about the interaction between man and nature. We believe these qualities of performance art can help create a better understanding of contemporary art as a hole.</p>

Amongst others they were featured on NPR, MSNBC, The Discovery Channel, on TV in Canada – even on public TV Tokyo. They were also shown on numerous art, design and culture websites and written about in magazines, including SOMA Magazine, an Italian Archeology Magazine and a Chinese Art Magazine. Photographs and video of the pieces are shown in exhibitions in California and in Europe this summer and fall.</p>
<p>During several exhilarating interactive community events that combined art-making and outdoor winter activity in a most beautiful landscape in Colorado, we created large drawings that could only be seen from the air in their entirety – and only for a very limited period of time.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href=""http://www.sonja-hinrichsen.com/interventions-in-nature/snow-drawings/snow-drawings-at-rabbit-ears-pass-colorado-2012/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Snow Drawings at Rabbit Ears Pass</a></p>
<p><strong>What exactly are “Snow Drawings”?</strong></p>
<p>“Snow Drawings” are large designs that I “draw” in the environment by walking lines into fresh snow surfaces with snowshoes. Ideal “canvases” are deforested areas, as well as frozen lakes and rivers. The finished pieces are ephemeral, and while they can take many hours to create, their duration is entirely unpredictable. In some occasions they have been coated over by snowdrift or new snowfall shortly after completion. This requires that I photograph them immediately. In one instance I had a total of 20 minutes before nightfall to photograph a piece that had taken me 12 hours to create. The next morning there was nothing there at all.</p>
<p><strong>Where did this idea come from? </strong></p>
<p>I began this project in winter 2009 during an artist residency in the Rocky Mountains. Inspired by the lay of the landscape, I designed patterns in my mind, which I then walked into the snow. My drawings have since become more complex, and I have created “Snow Drawings” in diverse landscapes, including Northern New Mexico, the Sierra Nevada near Lake Tahoe, on a frozen pond north of New York City, and various locations in Northwestern Colorado.</p>
<p><strong>How can the Community participate?</strong></p>
<p>In January 2012 I engaged the community in participatory “Snow Drawings” near Steamboat Springs, Colorado. While offering opportunity for people to actively assist in the making of art, this enabled me to create even larger pieces. Volunteers greatly enjoyed their partaking in these outdoor art-making events. Creating art is not only inherent in all of us, but is also a necessity for healthy human beings and a healthy society. <em>""Every human being is an artist who - from his state of freedom - … learns to determine the other positions in the total artwork of the future social order.""</em>  (Joseph Beuys).</p>
<p>These community events at Rabbit Ears Pass were made possible through the generous assistance of the Nature Conservancy of Colorado, the Steamboat Springs Arts Council and the Bud Werner Public Library of Steamboat Springs.</p>
<p>Thanks to a local pilot, who flew me over the area, I was able to shoot aerial photographs of the large-scale piece we had collaboratively created across the landscape within a fulfilling afternoon spent in the high-alpine Colorado winter world. A videographer with a remote-controlled helicopter shot video footage during the event, illustrating the creative process.</p>
<p><strong>And what are the plans for winter 2013?</strong></p>
<p>This past January‘s success - and experiencing how community volunteers took pleasure in their involvement in these outdoor art pieces - inspired even greater projects for this coming winter. I am now poised to create a more ambitious ""Snow Drawings"" project , involving host art- and environmental organizations across the US, providing opportunity for diverse communities to participate in the creative events, and resulting in monumental artworks embedded in varied landscapes. So far I have secured support from three organizations that will host and promote the events: in NY’s Hudson Valley, in Southern WY and in Northwestern CO. For the Colorado project we plan to work very large-scale – it is our goal to cover an entire frozen lake with snow drawings. The Wyoming snow drawings will be executed on a large prairie stretching across smooth hillsides near Saratoga Springs.  I am in discussion with additional venues across the US.</p>
<p><strong>Artwork that disappears - what is left after the events? </strong></p>
<p>As an artist and environmentalist I hope to inspire dialogue about issues connected to the natural world. Instead of creating lasting art pieces I rather like to unfold my work into large immersive experiences that live on in their documentation only (photo and video), and – more importantly – in the memories of my audiences.</p>
<p>During their short existence “Snow Drawings” correspond with the landscape – and so do those who help me create them. To make the work accessible to a larger audience, however, it is essential that photos be taken immediately after each event. The scale of the work requires aerial photography. In 2013 I will also put special emphasis on video, particularly to capture the process of creating these works in a group effort. I will arrange for photo-flights after each event, and videographers working with remote-controlled helicopters. The video will be edited for installations.</p>
<p>It is my goal to perform this work in as many different kinds of environments as possible. I hope that these pieces emphasize the beauty and uniqueness of each landscape, and thus inspire appreciation for nature - especially as modern society becomes increasingly disconnected from the natural world.</p>
<p><em>Hinrichsen creates work that is both informative and mystifying, methodical and magical. … Like the Native American tribes whose customs fascinate her, Hinrichsen orchestrates a symbolic relationship between the beauty of nature and the evolution of humanity. Her art speaks of the transience that defines our everyday lives, but rejoices in the wonders of the universe that transcend our earthly existence. (</em>Emilie Trice, “Traces of Nature”, SOMA magazine, May 2012)</p>
<p><strong>How can you help?</strong></p>
<p>Your donation will help take this project to a much greater level, to expand it to environments throughout the US, engage new communities in the creation of these works, and present it to new audiences across the country – this time in an even more majestic expression. Imagine seeing this work from an airplane or in a satellite image! The projects planned for winter 2013 require me to raise $6,500. Please help me reach my goal by donating to “Snow Drawings 2013”</p>
<p>Your donation will help pay for travel expenses, photo-flights at each location, hiring videographers, who will shoot process video with remote controlled helicopters, and snowshoes for volunteers who cannot provide their own. Your donation will also help pay for the production of large-scale photo-prints and video pieces that will then be shown in exhibitions worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>All donations are tax-deductible</strong>, as this project is Fiscally sponsored through Fractured Atlas– and you will also receive exciting rewards (see side panel).</p>
<p><strong>Other ways to help</strong></p>
<p>I know, of course, that not everyone is able to contribute financially. If you like my project, but cannot donate, you can still help by spreading the word, if you like.  Fell free to forward my campaign to people you know who might be interested in it, or post about it on facebook, twitter etc., or share it through the Indiegogo share tool.</p>

<p><strong>We are artists Tinsel &amp; Twinkle</strong>; we met when we were 9 years old over pots of poster paints at school. Since that fortuitous meeting we have spent years collaborating and exhibiting our art works, as well as forming part of The Fairies Band and also setting up Pushing Pussy Records, a label promoting bands with female involvement.<br/><br/> We have both pursued our own artistic practice as individual artists, but sharing a history and similar creative concerns, we often join forces to collaborate on projects and exhibit together, including co-curating exhibitions.<br/><br/> We also stage public art events such as the Kidnapped Banker stunt where we held a ‘banker’ to ransom at The Bank of Twinkle and Tinsel within a gallery space, while the public were encouraged to leave their thoughts about the current financial crisis on bespoke banknotes.<br/><br/><br/><em>PLEASE CHECK OUT THE GALLERY FOR SOME IMAGES OF THE PERKS AND OUR ARTWORK!!!</em><br/><br/><strong>What we are up to...</strong><br/><br/> Now we have been invited to exhibit at independent gallery, Galerie Michaela Stock which is in the heart of Vienna and in the midst of many other independent and established galleries. We have also been asked to take our interactive Bank of Twinkle and Tinsel with us, which will not only be set up in the gallery but will also be taking to the streets, so we can find out what people are really thinking and feeling about the global economy and how it is affecting them.<br/><br/> We created the ‘Bank of Twinkle &amp; Tinsel’ because the global economic crisis has been at the forefront of the media and political discussion for a long time, and we wanted to create something that would allow people to really talk about and share their thoughts on this issue in a different, creative arena. Instead of trading in money, our banknotes trade in thoughts.<br/><br/><strong>The part where we need to ask for your help!</strong><br/><br/> With considerable lack of funding for the arts both here and in Austria we are now turning to outside help to get the financial backing needed for two key parts of this opportunity:<br/><br/> - To ship our paintings out there<br/> - To fund the catalogue for the exhibition.<br/><br/> The catalogue is a unique opportunity for us. We have gained support from established and renowned artist Graham Crowley who is writing the foreword on us for it, the catalogue will not only be looking at works exhibited in Vienna but will be an overview of many different aspects of our creative careers. We believe this catalogue will be a wonderful and inspiring document to leave with visitors, collectors and gallerists in Vienna. It will give a professional edge to the show which in turn gives us extra credibility to an unknown audience and will provide an essential tool to learn more about us as artists.<br/><br/> By supporting our campaign on Indiegogo you will be helping two passionate UK artists make their mark in Vienna with a wonderful exhibiting opportunity. You’ll also be supporting us in our quest to give a voice to the public about how they are affected by the state of the financial world today. <br/><br/><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong><br/><br/> The funding we need to raise is £3000 (or $4700). These estimates have been rounded up to the nearest £100 to make sure any unforeseen costs are accounted for.<br/><br/> This will cover shipping of our paintings from London – Vienna and back which we estimate will cost £1700. The figure is based on a quote from Smart 4Art shipping specialists which includes the VAT.<br/><br/> The catalogue will be a further £1200 for printing costs and shipping to Vienna, based on a quote from Bishops Printers for 500 copies.<br/><br/> We will also need to take into account Indiegogo’s fees for using this platform which is why we have set our goal at £3000.<br/><br/> The unique perks we are offering to you in exchange for financial support are a range of limited edition items created and designed by us. We are offering prints, a Twinkle and Tinsel ‘Don’t Get Mugged’ mug, a studio visit, badges and signed photos of us from when we kidnapped our banker!<br/> If we don’t manage to reach our total of £3000, we will still be putting any funds we do raise towards getting our work to Vienna so we can go ahead with the exhibition and stage our bank.</p>

<p><br/> PLEASE CHECK OUT THE GALLERY FOR SOME IMAGES OF THE PERKS AND OUR ARTWORK!!!<br/><br/><strong>The Impact of your help:</strong><br/><br/> If you believe in art as a format for real conversation, ways to create change in the world or simply to discuss what is going on in minds and in the world, then supporting artists like us is a way to keep that dialogue going and to support an industry which is and always has been so important culturally and historically, but which is currently being financially starved for young contemporary artists like ourselves. <br/><br/> We have had success with public support from crowdfunding before when we needed to fund the shipping for a group exhibition in LA in 2011. The exhibition lead to further opportunities to exhibit at the Orange County Centre of Contemporary Arts and created a high impact exhibition promoting the UK’s contemporary art scene to LA.<br/><br/><strong>And finally!</strong><br/><br/> If you cant help financially we would be so appreciative if you could help us to spread the word about our campaign and to let any friends, family and colleagues you have who are passionate or interested in the arts know about what we are trying to achieve.<br/><br/> Please feel free to use the share tools and tell your Facebook friends, tweet about it and help us to let everybody know…any help at all is simply wonderful, thank you!<br/><br/> PLEASE CHECK OUT THE GALLERY FOR SOME IMAGES OF THE PERKS AND OUR ARTWORK!!!</p></div>","A little about us

This will cover shipping of our paintings from London – Vienna and back which we estimate will cost £1700. The figure is based on a quote from Smart 4Art shipping specialists which includes the VAT. The catalogue will be a further £1200 for printing costs and shipping to Vienna, based on a quote from Bishops Printers for 500 copies. We will also need to take into account Indiegogo’s fees for using this platform which is why we have set our goal at £3000. The unique perks we are offering to you in exchange for financial support are a range of limited edition items created and designed by us. We are offering prints, a Twinkle and Tinsel ‘Don’t Get Mugged’ mug, a studio visit, badges and signed photos of us from when we kidnapped our banker! If we don’t manage to reach our total of £3000, we will still be putting any funds we do raise towards getting our work to Vienna so we can go ahead with the exhibition and stage our bank.



 PLEASE CHECK OUT THE GALLERY FOR SOME IMAGES OF THE PERKS AND OUR ARTWORK!!!The Impact of your help: If you believe in art as a format for real conversation, ways to create change in the world or simply to discuss what is going on in minds and in the world, then supporting artists like us is a way to keep that dialogue going and to support an industry which is and always has been so important culturally and historically, but which is currently being financially starved for young contemporary artists like ourselves.  We have had success with public support from crowdfunding before when we needed to fund the shipping for a group exhibition in LA in 2011. The exhibition lead to further opportunities to exhibit at the Orange County Centre of Contemporary Arts and created a high impact exhibition promoting the UK’s contemporary art scene to LA.And finally! If you cant help financially we would be so appreciative if you could help us to spread the word about our campaign and to let any friends, family and colleagues you have who are passionate or interested in the arts know about what we are trying to achieve. Please feel free to use the share tools and tell your Facebook friends, tweet about it and help us to let everybody know…any help at all is simply wonderful, thank you!

<h3>A Letter from the Artist</h3>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>This spring I will be taking a moment away from my looms and my artwork to dedicate some time to a very important and different kind of art project, and I hope you will consider helping me with it.  2017/2018 marks a pivotal point in my career, and I wish to capture and capitalize on this moment.  I am creating and publishing a professional and beautiful 40-page monograph including artworks from three recent museum and gallery exhibitions, which will feature a critical essay by Amanda Dalla Villa Adams and an interview with NCMA curator Jen Dasal. </p>
<p>This book represents who I am and what I think about as an artist, right now.  Publishing and distributing it this year will continue the momentum of my recent success, helping to tell my story in a beautiful, impactful way, and on a national level.  It will be sent to museums, curators, and art departments across the country.  The goal is to build and sustain a thriving career as a professional artist. </p>
<p>My project is supported in part by a CultureWorks Artist Grant and in-kind by the North Carolina Museum of Art, but I really need your help to make the <i>Andrea Donnelly: Three Exhibitions</i> monograph a reality.  </p>
<p>With deep gratitude,</p>
<p>Andrea</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My Indiegogo fundraising goal is $9,000.  This amount will supplement the $3,000 CultureWorks Grant that I was awarded for this project in 2017.  Raising an additional $9,000 will fund high-quality design, printing, and publishing of the book, along with shipping costs to get it into the hands of at least 150 museums, curators, and collectors across the country.  Though I believe I will raise $9,000 with your help, I have created a flexible budget for a total project cost (which includes the CultureWorks funds) anywhere between $5,000 and $12,000.  This allows for varying tiers of design and production costs.  On the low end, I will publish with minimal freelance designer help, a mostly self-designed layout, and smaller quantity and lower quality publishing.  On the high end, your total donations will fund full-service layout design, a hardbound book with beautiful paper and high-quality printing, and quantities of 250 to 500 books.  Bottom line, I will be able to create a budget version of my book just by raising funds of $2,000.  Still, I’m shooting for $9,000 and maximum visual and object impact so my work can really shine (and we all love a beautiful hardcover book, right)? </p>
<p>Here’s an overview of the range of funding needs of the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Commission Fee, Amanda Adams critical essay: $1,600</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Publishing and Printing: from $1,300 to $6,500</strong><ul>
<li>Lower cost range, Blurb self-publishing: $1,300 to $2,000<ul><li>40-page photobook softcover, 25 copies per run of printing @$32.74 per book with 20%+ volume discount, 2-3 initial printing runs (50-75 copies)</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Professional Publishing (includes varying levels of professional design services): $2,800 to $6,500<ul>
<li>Lower end of funding: a small softcover book, 250 copies</li>
<li>Higher end of funding: a larger hardcover book, 250-500 copies</li>

<p><i>We've Met Before</i> at the North Carolina Museum of Art, September 2017-January 2018</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I identified the opportunity for self-publishing a monograph when I learned that the North Carolina Museum of Art would not be producing a catalog to accompany my recent (and very first of my career) solo museum exhibition there.  Seth Godin reminds me that we are lucky to live in a time where we can choose ourselves, taking our turn instead of waiting to be picked, and that’s why I’m creating this book. </p>
<p>A thriving art career is sustained by increasing levels of visibility, validation, and vetting of one’s work by relevant institutions; therefore, the value of a relationship/career-building tool like this monograph cannot be overstated.  The essay and interview will reinforce the conceptual depth of my work and its long-term value.  This will help convince more curators, museums, and collectors to invest in my career, and bring my work to a wider audience.  It will be the push I need to gain significant visibility and relevance in the larger art world, beyond my local communities of Richmond and Raleigh (where I am from, and where my family still lives). It will be my entry-point to create high-quality relationships with museums, galleries and institutions on a national level, which will in turn result in a new level of prestige in my exhibition record, and the acquisition of my work by museums and collecting institutions across the country. </p>
<p>I want to turn my recent successes into a sustaining and positive feedback loop: as the value of my work and its desirability to collecting institutions increases, I will be increasingly able to not only sustain my studio practice but truly support myself with that practice.  My work and my practice are not just my career, they are the way I see and move through the world.  I need to nourish and create opportunities to keep this thing going, because I have something to contribute to the world, and I’m just getting started. </p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>The challenge I foresee will come into play only if I raise a low amount of funds.  If I raise anywhere between $2,000 and $3,500, I will be in for some serious self-editing and design work.  Though I have published two small books on my own and am comfortable with self-publishing platforms, professional design is ideal.  But I am lucky to live in a supportive, generous community from which I can solicit design advice and feedback even if I’m doing the work myself.  Additionally, at lower levels of funding I will have to make quality and quantity decisions that reflect the reality of my budget and not the perfectionist standards of my artist-weaver heart.  Overall, the challenges of a lower budget are workable and will easily be overcome.  I am very confident in my own design aesthetic and work ethic, and in the professional generosity of my local community, to help me create a beautiful little book that I will be proud to put my name on, at any budget. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>My friends (and oh, you lovely and enthusiastic students), I know that not everyone can contribute to my project with a donation.  You can still help me, though!  Please share, share, share with anyone you know (because collectively you know tons more people than I do), who you think might get excited about this obsessive, thoughtful weaver from Richmond, her artwork, and her publishing project.  Oh, and I also appreciate and will accept with gratitude: kind words, cheers, and free advice.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for your help.</p>

20-25 models and circus performers every year, and we are actively involved in the arts scene in
Las Vegas, as well as several local charities. </span>

</div></div>","Our Story
Skin City Body Painting is
a woman-run cooperative of artists in Las Vegas who create art on the best canvas out there - the human body!  We create our ""living art"" for photo shoots, magazines,
television, theater, trade shows, conventions, promotions, parties and
more.  This company provides steady work to 12-15 freelance artists and
20-25 models and circus performers every year, and we are actively involved in the arts scene in
Las Vegas, as well as several local charities. 
It is owned and operated by
fine artist Robin Barcus-Slonina.




After 6 years of operating
this business out of suitcases and her garage, Skin City is ready to take the
next step and rent a storefront.  The perfect location has
been found - right in the heart of the emerging Las Vegas Arts District!  We
are taking the plunge big-time to create a multi-use art and photo studio, retail space
and artistic gathering spot.  We plan to use the space to sell the work of
local artists, grow our body painting business and give back to the community
with charity events.


What We Need & What You Get

There
 are many expenses associated with opening a space including: painting 
supplies, ladders, scaffolding, cement floor repairs, 
furnishings and equipment, signage, a cash register and safe, fire extinguishers, disability bathroom updates, security system, 
telephone, and of course purchasing merchandise!We are looking to raise $3000 here, but we would LOVE to go over our goal and every penny will be well-spent!  Realistically this venture will cost at least $15,000 to get started, but we will pace ourselves with whatever funds we raise.  No matter how much we raise here, our doors are officially opening for the Las Vegas First Friday Arts Festival on August 5, 2011!THE BEST THING ABOUT INDIE GO GO IS WE ARE NOT JUST ASKING FOR HAND-OUTS!  YOU WILL RECEIVE GIFTS FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS!  We are giving away something for every donation, even just $5!  Unique Skin City merchandise includes magnets, t-shirts, paintings and photographs as well as body painting sessions for those in Las Vegas!  Check out all our perks and enjoy this win-win form of fund-raising.  (Shipping is free within the continental USA, international shipping rates will apply for supporters out of the country!)

<p>Hers the plan. I'm going to pack up my screen printing gear and cameras and hit the road. I'll head north first, to Chico, to make a zine from start to finish in under 24 hours.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way I'll figure out how to make screen printing on the road work. this is the main challenge, but I believe I'll be able to do it. Once that is figured out I will print a multi color postcard and mail them from the nearest post office.</p>
<p>I also plan to have a camera attached to my hand all the time, and use that camera to take a whole lot of photos. </p>

Mi chiamo Simona e sono un'Artista Indipendente Italiana.<br/><br/>Alcuni anni fa ho subito un'intervento d'urgenza a causa di una malattia insidiosa chiamata Endometriosi (e ne ho subito un altro questo febbraio). Dopo l'intervento ho sviluppato una forte attrazione verso il Doodling (scarabocchio) e il disegno, cose che non avevo mai affrontato seriamente prima. Ho scoperto che disegnando sono in grado di tenere a bada i demoni della Depressione e i Dolori Cronici e di lasciare che la i miei pensieri scorrano liberi.<br/>Negli anni lo zendoodling (scarabocchio Zen) è diventato ben presto un compagno di vita. La mia abilità è migliorata e sono anche riuscita a vendere alcuni dei miei pezzi. Ormai non posso più immaginare di passare un giorno senza disegnare! :)<br/>Ma il 2014 mi sta davvero mettendo alla prova...<br/><br/>Nel 2013 sia io che mio marito abbiamo perso il lavoro. La crisi è dura in Italia. Stando alle offerte di lavoro, siamo troppo vecchi per trovare un impiego regolare e troppo giovani per la pensione. Inoltre, io sono l'unica a ricevere l'assegno di disoccupazione. E anche questo finirà a Luglio, se non trovo qualcosa prima.<br/><br/>Ed ecco spiegato il perchè dell'ARTISTA AFFAMATA. Con un marito affamato e 4 gatti famelici!<br/><br/>Per poter far fronte a questa situazione, mi trovo nella necessità di cercare fondi per acquistare i prodotti artistici, pagare le bollette dell'ADSL (per la vendita online) e produrre pezzi per le fiere e il negozio online (stampe, cartoline, borse ecc.).<br/><br/>Mi chiedevo, quindi, se foste interessati a darmi una mano a raggiungere il mio obiettivo e aiutare i miei cuccioli ad avere la loro pappa. :)<br/><br/>A parte il disegno, le altre cose importanti della mia vita sono la famiglia e far sorridere le persone. Ciò che vorrei fare se dovessi raggiungere e superare il funding, è aiutare l'organizzazione non governativa di mia sorella. Si chiama <b>GNU SOLIDARIO</b> (http://<span><a href=""http://www.gnusolidario.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.gnusolidario.org</a></span>). Hanno sviluppato <b>GNU HEALTH</b>, uno strumento medico gratuito per aiutare i non privilegiati. (C'è anche la versione italiana).<br/>Se fossi in grado di avere un piccolo business incentrato sui miei lavori, potrei dare una mano con delle donazioni.<br/><br/><b>Naturalmente sarò DAVVERO GRATA a tutti coloro che vorranno supportarmi! Vi ringrazierò con la mia ARTE basata sulle mie serie GIARDINO SEGRETO e GUFI. Ogni pezzo sarà diverso. (nella colonna di destra troverete ciò che offro con la descrizione anche in Italiano).</b><br/><br/>Se non potete permettervi di inviare denaro, non c'è problema: <b>potrete contribuire PROMUOVENDO</b> questa campagna sul vostro blog o sito web. Oppure usando i bottoni di condivisione di IndieGoGo. Lo apprezzerò molto! :)<br/><br/>Vi ringrazio fin d'ora per il vostro aiuto. Farò costanti aggiornamenti, quindi tornate a trovarmi qui! <br/><br/></p></div>","(Per la versione in Italiano scorrete in basso)THE STORY BEHIND A STARVING ARTISTHello! My name is Simona.

Ho scoperto che disegnando sono in grado di tenere a bada i demoni della Depressione e i Dolori Cronici e di lasciare che la i miei pensieri scorrano liberi.Negli anni lo zendoodling (scarabocchio Zen) è diventato ben presto un compagno di vita. La mia abilità è migliorata e sono anche riuscita a vendere alcuni dei miei pezzi. Ormai non posso più immaginare di passare un giorno senza disegnare! :)Ma il 2014 mi sta davvero mettendo alla prova...Nel 2013 sia io che mio marito abbiamo perso il lavoro. La crisi è dura in Italia. Stando alle offerte di lavoro, siamo troppo vecchi per trovare un impiego regolare e troppo giovani per la pensione. Inoltre, io sono l'unica a ricevere l'assegno di disoccupazione. E anche questo finirà a Luglio, se non trovo qualcosa prima.Ed ecco spiegato il perchè dell'ARTISTA AFFAMATA. Con un marito affamato e 4 gatti famelici!Per poter far fronte a questa situazione, mi trovo nella necessità di cercare fondi per acquistare i prodotti artistici, pagare le bollette dell'ADSL (per la vendita online) e produrre pezzi per le fiere e il negozio online (stampe, cartoline, borse ecc.).Mi chiedevo, quindi, se foste interessati a darmi una mano a raggiungere il mio obiettivo e aiutare i miei cuccioli ad avere la loro pappa. :)A parte il disegno, le altre cose importanti della mia vita sono la famiglia e far sorridere le persone. Ciò che vorrei fare se dovessi raggiungere e superare il funding, è aiutare l'organizzazione non governativa di mia sorella. Si chiama GNU SOLIDARIO (http://www.gnusolidario.org). Hanno sviluppato GNU HEALTH, uno strumento medico gratuito per aiutare i non privilegiati. (C'è anche la versione italiana).Se fossi in grado di avere un piccolo business incentrato sui miei lavori, potrei dare una mano con delle donazioni.Naturalmente sarò DAVVERO GRATA a tutti coloro che vorranno supportarmi! Vi ringrazierò con la mia ARTE basata sulle mie serie GIARDINO SEGRETO e GUFI. Ogni pezzo sarà diverso. (nella colonna di destra troverete ciò che offro con la descrizione anche in Italiano).Se non potete permettervi di inviare denaro, non c'è problema: potrete contribuire PROMUOVENDO questa campagna sul vostro blog o sito web. Oppure usando i bottoni di condivisione di IndieGoGo. Lo apprezzerò molto! :)Vi ringrazio fin d'ora per il vostro aiuto. Farò costanti aggiornamenti, quindi tornate a trovarmi qui!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

This time, we have some interesting projects from other collaborators. Works to print include a poem in the Mayan language by Isaac Carrillo Can, work by Frank Brannon and Jeff Marley, and possibly a couple of other projects.</p><p>For those who don't know, New Echota was the last capitol for the Cherokee Nation in the eastern U.S. before the Trail of Tears in 1838. The first indigenous language newspaper, the Cherokee Phoenix, was 
printed here beginning in 1828. Before the removal, the original press 
was seized by the Georgia Guard in 1835. New Echota Historic Site today is maintained by the Georgia state park system and is situated close to Calhoun, GA. The print shop at New Echota was re-created from historical discriptions along with a press from the late 19th century.<br/></p><h4>
<i>Why is This Important?</i><br/>
</h4><p>We feel that to print these works at New Echota, in the same place that the Cherokee Phoenix was printed, and printing in the Cherokee language is a significant act in itself. This act recognizes and honors the lives of our ancestors that lived, loved, and died there. It honors all indigenous peoples by collaborating with different peoples from diverse backgrounds, uniting us through art, language, and action. It solidifies the notion that through art based collaborative efforts, we can bridge communities.</p><h4><i>How Will the Money Raised Be Used?</i></h4><p>We are seeking funding only for the actual costs of this project. We've included are budget so you can see exactly where the money will go. Both Frank and I will not be receiving any type of personal compensation for this. If we do raise funds beyond our goal, our intentions are to use those to return to print at New Echota in 2015 for a third time.</p><h4><i>Our Budget:</i></h4><ul>
<li>Food..............................$100</li>
<li>Gas................................$100<br/>
</li>
<li>Printing supplies..........$180</li>

This time, we have some interesting projects from other collaborators. Works to print include a poem in the Mayan language by Isaac Carrillo Can, work by Frank Brannon and Jeff Marley, and possibly a couple of other projects.For those who don't know, New Echota was the last capitol for the Cherokee Nation in the eastern U.S. before the Trail of Tears in 1838. The first indigenous language newspaper, the Cherokee Phoenix, was 
printed here beginning in 1828. Before the removal, the original press 
was seized by the Georgia Guard in 1835. New Echota Historic Site today is maintained by the Georgia state park system and is situated close to Calhoun, GA. The print shop at New Echota was re-created from historical discriptions along with a press from the late 19th century.
Why is This Important?
We feel that to print these works at New Echota, in the same place that the Cherokee Phoenix was printed, and printing in the Cherokee language is a significant act in itself. This act recognizes and honors the lives of our ancestors that lived, loved, and died there. It honors all indigenous peoples by collaborating with different peoples from diverse backgrounds, uniting us through art, language, and action. It solidifies the notion that through art based collaborative efforts, we can bridge communities.How Will the Money Raised Be Used?We are seeking funding only for the actual costs of this project. We've included are budget so you can see exactly where the money will go. Both Frank and I will not be receiving any type of personal compensation for this. If we do raise funds beyond our goal, our intentions are to use those to return to print at New Echota in 2015 for a third time.Our Budget:
Food..............................$100
Gas................................$100

Printing supplies..........$180
Lodging.........................$160
Fees & Postage..............$60


TOTAL...........................$600

How You Can HelpFor those who get involved and support us, you'll receive some of the fruits of our labor at the $25, $50, and $100 levels. Here's how it breaks down:
$25 - Receive one print from Jeff Marley (his choice).
$50 - Receive two prints, one from Jeff Marley and one from Frank Brannon (their choice).
$100 - Everything! You'll get one of each project printed, including the Mayan/Cherokee poem, prints from Jeff Marley, prints from Frank Brannon, and anything else we produce.
All prints will be delivered within three weeks of completion of the project.Other Ways You Can Help

<h2>Brief Summary</h2>
<p>My name is Joe Nardelli. I am creating a table top picture book called <strong>LOVE LOSS LIFE – <em>A Tribute to Michele DeMeo</em></strong> as a promotional tool for the documentary film I am making about Michele.</p>
<p>This picture book is intended to celebrate Michele DeMeo's life and is a reflection of the challenges she faces as depicted in our film scheduled for release in May 2013. You can view information about the film at <a href=""http://www.lovelosslife.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""www.lovelosslife.org""><strong>www.lovelosslife.org</strong></a>.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">To capture Michele's story I have been interviewing family members, friends, health care professionals and professional associates of Michele’s to learn more about her life and the special woman that she is.</span></p>
<p>I recently received a Creative Impact Award from the Cultural Alliance of York County, Pennsylvania to help me complete my film.</p>
<p>As I endeavor to better understand the challenges Michele is facing as a hospice care patient living with ALS, melanoma and autism, I am also discovering the influence her strategically positive attitude is having on everyone included in her personal life, in the York, PA community and in her professional circles.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">I capture the story of Michele in my film and will reflect the essence of her lovely personality through the picture book, which will serve as a unique and personal memoir of the film making experience we shared together.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><em>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</em></strong></h3>
<p>As a producer I have completed numerous film projects for clients such as ABC Networks, Warner Bros. Records, Sony Music Entertainment, Capitol Records and other major corporations. I have received Gold and Platinum records as well as awards and recognition for narrative, educational and music video programs I have directed and produced. I am also proud to say I worked directly with Miles Davis and many other celebrated musicians, actors and directors.</p>
<p>I first turned to education in 1996 with the production of “My Hair’s Falling Out... Am I Still Pretty” A Childhood Cancer Education Video. The success of this film (Parent’s Choice Silver Honor Group Film Award) lead to the implementation of a childhood cancer education initiative that reached hundreds of middle-school students over a period of six years, in New York City, Pennsylvania and Indiana.</p>
<p>Following a fifteen-year career as a producer I turned back to writing and directed a play entitled “No Plugs To Pull”, which opened at the William Redfield Theater in New York City. The plot (ironically) was based on the decision a woman with a terminal illness makes to end her own life with assistance by a physician, but in the moments that follow her decision she is given an opportunity to change her mind.</p>
<p>I am proud to say that many people attended my play over its six-week run and that Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. was among them. Two years later Mr. Vonnegut released a book called ""God Bless You Dr. Kervorkian"".</p>
<p>To expand my interests in pubic service I accepted an administrative position in a NYC public school as a Parent Coordinator. The skills and expertise I acquired over a nine-year period in parent advocacy recently lead me to Tom Allon, who has stepped in as a candidate for the 2013 NYC Mayoral Race. As a volunteer on Tom's campaign I am writing parent policy and educational reform strategies.</p>
<p>I hold an M.F.A. from New York University in Film and Television Production and a B.A. from LaSalle College in Communications Arts.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><em>THE PURPOSE</em></strong></h3>
<p><span>I want to make this table top picture book so people who are challenged by end of life circumstances and physical disabilities can be inspired by Michele's story.</span></p>
<p><span>It is also my hope that this book will provide Michele's family, friends and professional associates a memory of Michele, especially over this very special period of time in her life - from her diagnosis of ALS through the completion of our film. This is how we can all celebrate her.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">This picture book will include original photos from the documentary film as well as notes about the process Michele and I experienced making the film together. It will also include a very special story that marked a distinct turning point in our collaboration during the filming process.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">The picture book will also help us promote the release of our film.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">At some point a portion of all proceeds will be donated to the International Association of Central Services and Hospital Materials Management (IACSHMM) an organization that sets standards for sterile processing technicians - a little known field in the medical industry, in which Michele served as a dedicated professional and leader for twenty years.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span></p>
<h3><strong><em>THE CHALLENGES</em></strong></h3>
<p>Currently, I live in New York City, but I am planning to visit York, Pennsylvania to be closer to Michele over the next few months. I will travel to her regularly to organize the photos and write and edit the text for this book with her.</p>
<p>At the pace Michele likes to work I believe we can complete this picture book  and have it ready for distribution as early as April. It will be released as a promotional tool in advance of the documentary film, which will be submitted to all of the major film festivals internationally.</p>
<p>Like our film, the picture book will give individuals, especially those challenged by end of life circumstances, a point of view that is truthful and inspiring.</p>
<p>In the picture book (as she does in the film) Michele will share insights about the importance of family and acceptance, her reflections about spirituality and purpose, the need we all have for creative expression and ultimately what it means to let go.</p>
<p>Your participation as a funder will allow me to serve Michele's greater vision, which is to inspire others to live life to its fullest every day by choice, even if we are told by someone else, that our time on earth is limited.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></strong></h2>
</div>
<p>This campaign requires <strong>$17,500.00</strong> to cover the costs of materials and supplies, the design and layout, digital conversion and color correction of images, copy editing, writing and the physical production of 500 books.</p>
<p>There are unique production circumstances to consider. Mainly, because I will have to be on stand-by for most of the preparation, writing and editing phases of the collaborative and creative process. This means that atypical transportation, accommodations and meal expenses will be incurred and that I will have to adapt to Michele's irregular schedule with limitations due to the care she now receives and how she manages her time in order to remain strong and healthy.</p>
<p>We will produce a 12""x14"" hard-cover, full-color table top picture book that includes photos, captions, text and commissioned illustrations.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">The perks on this project are really unique because the book will only be released in a limited edition. And everyone will receive something they will be proud of.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Specifically donors will receive an allocated portion or combination of the following for their funding participation: a thank you in our book in a special section dedicated to all funding participants; a limited edition, digital copy of the books original cover on beautiful photo paper; a thank you in our film credits as a picture book funding source participant; a copy of the first edition of the picture book; a copy of a limited edition, signed copy of the picture book with a unique signature page that is inserted in a protective sleeve then affixed permanently to the inside cover of the book; a password that allows private access to the documentary film.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Additionally, two donors will receive an all-expense paid trip to a screening of our film at the first film festival that schedules it in New York, Massachusetts, Chicago or Utah.</span></p>
<p>If we aren't able to reach our entire funding goal, we will scale back the size of the book and the design details, and replace the cover illustration with a photographic montage.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Impact You Will Help Us Create!</h2>
<p>The combination of this picture book and the film when released has a potential to directly impact almost 30,000 collegues that know Michele professionally. They read her profesional articles, they train to the standards and guodes she has written, they practice methods she has created and they utilize devices she has invented.</p>
<p>The extended medical professional reach may be 100,000 or more combined individuals, organizations and professional associations worldwide. And if you consider the patients each of them reaches along with the network of individuals and professionals who follow Michele on Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter and the related Blogs generated by her authorship in the medical industry, we are talking about possibly a million individuals who will potentially come to eventually learn of the picture book and film.</p>
<p>Michele's brand will also soon be launched and sponsored by one of the largest medical supplies corporations in the world. This will result in an unforseen reach that will continue to grow steadily as legislators across the nation enact sterile processing legislation in their states with Michele DeMeo's name attached to every bill signed into law.</p>
<p>And all of this preceeds the actual success of the film, already acclaimed by medical professionals who have requested copies for use in their hospice and palliative care education departments.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">And if the hundreds of emails we've received by those who have viewed the trailer is any indication - the film and picture book could easily become the most anticipated medical documentary since Michael Moore's ""Sicko"".</span></p>
<p>To measure the impact our picture book and our film will have on readers and audiences is impossible, but if you support us the goodwill created by you will keep us on a path to reach the goals we know we can achieve.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span></p>
<h2><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></strong></h2>

<p>And if you can't afford to make a funding committment please feel free to contact me directly through the film's website to share how you can help us spread the word about the picture book campaign and importance of living life fully during the time we are given here on earth.</p>
<p>I would like to thank you personally. Just reading this far means that you are someone who is interested in life, and that you have the willingness to discover how others are trying to make a difference.</p>

As a college student, I can't take on the cost alone, but want to continue drawing. I want my fan art to bring joy and feels to the tumblr community. I want my original work to be successful in the future. I just have to make that a possibility.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I'm from Denver, I lived in Philadelphia and I'm currently living in 
Oakland California. I have been fortunate to have my art appreciated by so many 
people in so many places.<br/><br/>With BEACON, what I want to do is paint four murals in Oakland 
before October 1st. I am asking for your help to pay 
for the supplies, paint and the artist hours that are going to go into creating
 these murals. So far I have approached several sites and two of them have 
said 'yes'. I'm dealing with this on a first-come first-served basis so 
whichever of the first four sites say yes those will be the four 
murals I will be painting. I am really hyped to get going on these 
murals and I'm excited to exhibit the process and ultimately the 
finished pieces.<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am raising $10,000 for this project. ($2000 will go to paint and supplies, $8000 for artist hours)</li> <li>I will be creating new drawings and a limited series of silkscreen prints that will go along with selected originals and print packages that I shall give as perks for donating to the campaign.<br/>
</li> <li>If I don't reach the entire goal, that means I have less funds for hours and supplies, which means the project will still go on, but on a smaller scale. To make this project as big as possible, let's reach the full goal!</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to scatter a story told with murals through different neighborhoods in Oakland, CA. I'm doing this out of the excitement of contributing to the elaborate creative conversation happening here in the Bay Area. I plan on broadcasting the the creative process and results in hopes that locals and visitors to the city of Oakland will be inspired to follow the path laid forth and explore the diverse collection of colors, textures, sights and sounds that this city has to offer.</p>
<p>I have so far already created murals in Philadelphia, Denver, Washington D.C., Portland, Mexico City and Oakland.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> The main challenges, at this point, on top of raising funds is just getting walls okayed for the project. So far, with 2 walls secured, we're halfway there. I will communicate with my Oakland network to find and approach property owners for the final 2 walls.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Outside of donating money to the Indiegogo, you can help me out by sharing my campaign on social networks (facebook, twitter, instagram, etc.) Also, I will be able to use some help with painting the murals.

<p>The word Epistrophy has two meanings that I'm interested in.  An Epistrophy is a repetition of a word or an expression at the end of os successive phrases or verses for poetic effect or to add emphasis. --And my favorite definition:  An Epistrophy is the experience of seeing our own distance from our true selves,  a moment when we become aware of our separation from the One.  The pictures in this show are trying to convey this automatic, unconscious repetition, but also the transcending of it.</p>

called Fjörgyn. It will have an amazing sound system and 
aerial silk artists performing from the mast. Our most recent endeavor 
was Thor, a 20' Viking ship. PlayaGods seek to reunite mother and son, 
so Fjörgyn and Thor will sail together on the playa.We have been involved with various theme camps such as Brand-UR-Ass, Homebrew 4A Homebrew and Pink 
Fuzzy Monkey with Superhero Underwear at Twisted Family Reunion; and  
worked on the Porch Flea, built the Roadside Temple, created the very 
first Banana Phone Charging Station, as well as participated in and/or 
supported countless other Burning Man projects over the past 16 years.<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Fjörgyn is a massive 40 foot viking ship with a lot of planned features. Your donation will help offset the cost of providing an incredible experience on Fjörgyn for all who venture along its path at Burning Man. Some of the features include:</p><ul>
<li>3,000 watt sound system complete with two 18"" subs, four tower speakers with 15"" bass drivers, and four additional speakers hanging from the bow and stern of the ship to provide incredible lateral sound, perfect for late night dance excursions and epic sunrise DJ sessions.</li>
<li>Mast boom where aerial silk artists will twirl over a dancing crowd, 29 feet above Fjörgyn's deck. <br/>
</li>
<li>Open dance floor with radical illumination, all on top of a 16 thousand pound axle. <br/>
</li>
<li>Elevated DJ Crow's Nest on the mast will overlook the entire art car, and allow the DJ to stand in any direction to face the crowd on the boat, or perhaps a massive dance party on the adjacent playa. <br/>
</li>
<li>Fjörgyn can transport 30 vikings at a time on her wild adventures of pillaging and plundering. <br/>
</li>
</ul><h2>Perks</h2><p>We have some amazing one-of-a-kind perks for varying levels of donation, including Thor's hammer pendants, t-shirts, hand-made Viking beanies complete with horns and blacklight reactive, and even a special night out on Fjörgyn with you and your best friends. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Construction</h3>Fjörgyn is already under construction, check out some photos below.

Introduce yourself and your background. Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you. Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve. 
Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?




  What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail: 
Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.  Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited! Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal. 




  The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make: 
Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world. Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one). Make it real for people and build trust. 
  Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal. 
Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles. Describe your plan for solving these challenges. 
  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help: 
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!

<h3>A Magical Mobile Sculpture</h3>
<p>Tarna is a mobile sculpture of a giant Jackalope. Our mythical horned rabbit is being built on a refurbished minibus. On the outside, it's a metallic art car with a DJ sound stage, complete with lighting and flame effects. On the inside, it's a plush lounge and cozy gallery space. </p>

For budding comickers such as myself, Sailor Moon was a big part of our formative years that showed us that not only could women be the heroes, but we could be the heroes and still be ourselves. There was no one perfect way to be the heroine, nor was there one perfect way to be a woman.  Sailor Moon was one of the most inclusive fictions for young girls of it's generation, no matter who you were, you could find a Sailor Soldier/Guardian/Scout that you could relate to on some level, and it meant a great deal to many young creators and readers of my generation. To this end I decided I wanted to do something to celebrate it's 20th anniversary and it's introduction to a whole new generation!I certainly do. I've previously done serialized graphic novel work such as Next Exit, for Slave Labor Graphics and RE:Play for TokyoPop. I currently create the series, Dire Hearts, for the inclusive fiction magazine, Sparkler Monthly, published by Chromatic Press.(Note: While this project, and my current series, is all ages, not all images or series on links below are, please click responsibly!)Sparkler MagazineMy Tumblr My DA Sailor Moon has a lot of characters, so the initial output for a printing of a set of 10 charms is quite a bit more than I can afford to pay out of pocket.

<h3>The Love Affair</h3>
<p></p>
<p>They say books are dying. They say books won't survive the digital age. They say no one reads or writes in books anymore. I say books are not dying they're changing, or they have to change in order to keep up with culture. Books are so, so, so important. Not only the printed, published books, but books for writing (where do you think those other books start?). Me and books have had a love affair since I was a small child documenting the ins and outs of first grade in a tiny (square, I might add) pink journal with a lock that my sister broke (later she stole the journal and it was lost forever), though I haven't the proof (little sisters, amiright?).</p>
<p>Journals document our interests, our feelings and our days. They keep track of our to do lists and act as historical record. And when your child's child's child becomes a writer and thinks ""How cool would it be to have Great Grandma's journal, maybe there's a story in it,"" they'll find it tucked away somewhere and become entranced with the mundaneness and sordid details of it all and then turn it into something amazing. Would you want to deprive your great grandchild that possibility? </p>
<p>My great grandparents didn't even so much as leave me letters to decipher and I'll be miffed about that for at least another twenty years (don't even get me started). Don't leave your great grandchildren miffed with you. Learning to make books and immersing myself in book culture, which started with writing, through on to publishing and back round to the making, puts me, and by proxy you, not only at the forefront of the future of books, but strongly standing to preserve the book.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Obstacles Overcome</h3>
<p>There are two challenges I see in this plan:</p>
<p>One:</p>
<ul><li>The class schedules at the two book making facilities not coinciding with my plans.</li></ul>
<div>Prevention plan:<p></p>
<ul><li>As things come together I will contact both facilities and work out something for a special visitor. Essentially arrange a class with them or arrange to use their facilities with guided help for a small fee for the days that I'll be in town.</li></ul>
<p>Two:</p>
<ul><li>Money. Obviously. </li></ul>
<p>Action plan:</p>
<ul><li>Listen, guys, the base price is the flight, right? So if I can get that, just that, I'm going to muster what I can together and do what I can while I'm there with what I have.  I really hope this comes to full fruition, but I want you to know that it's that important to me.</li></ul>
<div>
<h3>Need More Visual?</h3>Keep watching my Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, Google+ or Facebook fan page for book arts work I want to learn and sample text art images and previous photos taken to get an idea of what I might conjure for this project. Once you donate I'll regularly update with examples of how I've grown and what I've learned via email.</div>

<p><b><u>Arts on the Move Festival</u></b><b> is a not-for-profit organisation. The
festival is a one-day event that takes place at Poltimore House and invites
theatre, music, dance, visual art, poetry, comedy and other live performance to
join us in raising awareness for both the Poltimore House Trust and the local
artistic talent in Exeter. We are an event that accommodates a wide audience of
all ages and are a guaranteed fun day out on an English summer's day.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Arts on the Move Festival celebrates the arts
and heritage of the South West. </p>
<p>On Sunday 25th
May 2014 (1pm-8pm), Arts on the Move will open the Poltimore House gates for
its third year running. We've had a fantastic range in performance artists over
our time and this year looks to be, once again, an incredible day rich in
talent from both local and University of Exeter artists. </p>
<p>However,
festivals cost a lot of money! We wouldn't have made it this far without the
charitable generosity of our audience members and hard-working volunteers. We
owe so much to the wonderful public of Exeter, who we in return aim to give a
vibrant and wonderful day out once a year. </p>
<p>All funding
goes directly to the Poltimore House Trust. This year some profit will also be
available for funding for our artists subsequent to the event, to help them
continue their projects in Exeter. Even our hard-working management and
organisation team are volunteers! So the money that you donate is 100% for a
charitable cause. It may help us with the decorations, artist's expenses,
marketing, and food &amp; beverage businesses. The more money we raise, the
bigger and better the festival can become. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F6qoRJER9Ro0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6qoRJER9Ro0&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F6qoRJER9Ro0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<p><b>From the Arts on the Move</b><b> #aotm </b><b>team.</b></p></div>","Arts on the Move Festival is a not-for-profit organisation. The
festival is a one-day event that takes place at Poltimore House and invites
theatre, music, dance, visual art, poetry, comedy and other live performance to
join us in raising awareness for both the Poltimore House Trust and the local
artistic talent in Exeter. We are an event that accommodates a wide audience of
all ages and are a guaranteed fun day out on an English summer's day.

Arts on the Move Festival celebrates the arts
and heritage of the South West. 
On Sunday 25th
May 2014 (1pm-8pm), Arts on the Move will open the Poltimore House gates for
its third year running. We've had a fantastic range in performance artists over
our time and this year looks to be, once again, an incredible day rich in
talent from both local and University of Exeter artists. 
However,
festivals cost a lot of money! We wouldn't have made it this far without the
charitable generosity of our audience members and hard-working volunteers. We
owe so much to the wonderful public of Exeter, who we in return aim to give a
vibrant and wonderful day out once a year. 
All funding
goes directly to the Poltimore House Trust. This year some profit will also be
available for funding for our artists subsequent to the event, to help them
continue their projects in Exeter. Even our hard-working management and
organisation team are volunteers! So the money that you donate is 100% for a
charitable cause. It may help us with the decorations, artist's expenses,
marketing, and food & beverage businesses. The more money we raise, the
bigger and better the festival can become.

are doing there please see the link below:

<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to visit my campaign,</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Stefanie from Cape Town, South Africa and I've been passionate about art since I was 4 years old. It has always been my dream to bring art to kids, especially those with special needs and learning difficulties. I suffer from bipolar disorder and my struggle has given me insight into the challenges experienced by those with mental difficulties.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492423007/gkj4wkoxnqn5cws8yo12.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I've been tutoring children in various projects for the last 10 years. I studied psychology at UNISA and I've completed several courses on education for kids with special needs &amp; child psychology. I worked with high school kids with learning difficulties and I've also worked with preschoolers with autism spectrum disorders and other difficulties. Helping these kids changed my life and I am now forever dedicated to this cause.</p>
<p>Our tailored art sessions will be beneficial to children suffering from the following disorders: Selective Mutism, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder and other special needs and learning difficulties.</p>

<h3>The Studio and outreach programs</h3>
<p>Opening my own studio has always been my passion. I have used all my personal savings to obtain as much art materials and equipment as possible. For our sessions to reach as many children as possible they need to be very affordable. The studio project and outreach programs are costly and this is why we need your help. We need to purchase equipment, furniture for the studio, various art materials, admin and advertising and other costs. any small donation would be greatly appreciated.</p>

That era was full of different emotions (bravery, anger, pride, betrayal, etc).<br/>After reading and seeing a lot about this part of the History (Samuraï), I felt even more connected to Japan. I needed to express what I had in my mind, and I naturally have choosen to use traditional Japanese tools to create it. <br/>Makoto -Sincerity-  is what I express in my Art, there is no lies there because I can be free of my thoughts &amp; feelings.<br/> </p>

I want to make it simple, quick and great value.

Ultimately I want Ink+Paper to become known as a source of exciting and unusual art products, where you know you will always find something engaging, beautiful and fun! These subscription packs are the first step towards this vision, and these are the standards I will be holding myself to throughout the development of this product.With this is mind, here is the first collection and the six artists behind it!Natasha Newton - Moon Rise - Art PrintAbout Natasha:Natasha Newton is a full-time artist and illustrator, who splits her time between the English counties of Suffolk and Surrey. She gains most of the ideas and inspiration for her work during regular walks along the beach, and through the heath lands, fields, and forests that surround her, as well as the landscape of the Peak District National Park.Her paintings are created in acrylic on canvas, and in watercolour, gouache, and ink on paper, as she enjoys the versatility of water-based media. She works from dark to light, applying the paint to the canvas in thin layers, while allowing each application to remain partially visible through the subsequent layers, giving the paintings a wonderful richness and depth of tone.WebsiteBabs Pease - Red Squirrel with Beech Nuts - Art PostcardAbout Babs:Babs has been working as an artist and printmaker since graduating from Edinburgh University and lives outside a small village near Dollar, Clackmannanshire, Scotland. Much of her inspiration comes from the beautiful landscape of the Ochils and the rich variety of flora and fauna within it. Her designs are all hand carved onto linocut blocks and then printed by her, using an antique victorian relief press.WebsiteElla Goodwin - Let It Go - Art PostcardAbout Ella:Inspired by fairtyales and folklore, craft and nature, Ella's work takes you through a whimsical world of delicately detailed scenes and characters.As well as Illustration Ella's background is in Animation and Graphic Design, which she studied to a Masters Level concentrating on narrative for children and development. Ella's passion is for visual storytelling and whimsical illustration often highly detailed using traditional and digital mediums.Ella also tutors part time for IDI on their Graphic Design and Illustration BA, runs Norwich Makers Market and curates local exhibitions.WebsiteKat Tromans - Hyperreality - Art PostcardAbout Katherine:Katherine Tromans is a Freelance Illustrator and Designer based in Birmingham, UK,  who creates luminous paintings and prints.

</div>","Finding art that resonates with you isn’t easy. But neither is being an artist. Rents are high, wages are low, and funding is tough to come by.For the past five years I've been the editor of Art Threat, a blog on socially-engaged art. Artists we write about often thank us for spreading the word. But while media coverage can help build an artist's profile, it rarely brings home the bacon.Meanwhile, readers sometimes ask where they can buy an artist's work. Too often the answer is that they can't, at least not without a trip to a gallery in New York or Toronto.As an arts marketer who loves building both audiences and community, I saw an opportunity to help artists sell prints of their work to an audience that is hungry for meaningful art for their homes. We're just about ready to open shop, and you can help us achieve that next step by making a contribution and getting some sweet perks in return! The funding will help purchase the remaining equipment and supplies we will use to get prints out the door and into your mailbox. We are raising $5000, which will be used as follows: 

$2500 — Equipment: a wide-format, workhorse printer.

$1500 — Materials: papers and labels and inks — oh my!
$500 — Web Design: some dinero for the developers.
$500 — Postage: getting perks into your hands.


It's all about the art! Our campaign perks will fill your walls with limited-edition prints made by artists who create change through creativity. Contribute and you'll get a digital gift card to redeem for a print once we launch the Hugs With Arms shop. The limited-edition prints come in three sizes and are printed on acid-free art paper using archival inks. They're shipped with a signed certificate of authenticity and are guaranteed to arrive in mint condition. Worldwide shipping included!

We will launch with 20 unique prints to pick from, and will release new prints every month.All contributors receive exclusive VIP access to the shop for 10 days so you can get first dibs on our very first limited-edition prints before we open to the public. Perks also include one or more $10 coupons that you can give to a friend — earning good cultural karma! — or use yourself on a future order. Finally, Perk Bundles give you more bang for your buck, featuring two or more prints at a reduced price. Our most exclusive bundle also includes a special trip to your favourite art gallery. Learn more about our perks on the right side of this page.

I’m a 73 year oldPoet/Musician/Playwright/Photographer/Teacher with Muscular Sclerosis who, with your help, is going to the 11th International Poetry Festival in Granada, Nicaragua this February. I’ve been published in English & Spanish in the USA, Mexico & Europe. I’m a popular Bay Area Radio DeeJay on both KPOO in San Francisco & KPFA in Berkeley, California for many years & leader of “Avotcja & Modúpue."" 
   What I Need & What You Get This is an expensive undertaking, with planefare, hotel, food & ambulatory devices to help me get around, I will need $2500. So I’m asking for your help. There is no amount too small or too large & many friends have offered CDs and other gifts to offer.  With your help I know we can do this. My participation will create a link between the Bay Area cultural community & Nicaragua which we hope will grow in the future. Please spread the word & I thank you in advance for your support.   The Impact I want to represent you and our community at the International Poetry Festival in Granada, Nicaragua. There are well over a hundred Poets coming from over 40 countries to this amazing Festival & I want to be one of that number. In the last ten years this Poetry festival (which also includes Music, Dance & Theater) has brought together more than a thousand Poets from 96 countries including Nicaragua who have shared their work with more than 400 thousand people creating an intergenerational & international cultural exchange.    Risks & Challenges As a disabled person I know how to overcome challenges.

Whenever someone wants to know who that guy was in that movie, or how that magic trick was really done, the answer is a few keystrokes away.

<p>Greetings Potential Contributors to PETRI(E) Inventory 65,</p>
<p>I want to thank you for taking the time to consider helping to fund PETRI(E).  Currently, I am in my final year of studies at the London College of Fashion, where I am studying towards a degree in fashion journalism.  However, I have had an ample amount of experience working within the magazine sector of the fashion industry.  In my professional experience, I have contributed to and held positions at renowned publications such as TANK, LOVE, GQ Style, American Vogue and British Vogue.  You can learn more about my personal work and experiences at <a href=""http://www.zadriansmith.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.zadriansmith.com</a>  My experiences at these magazines gave me first hand insight into how the magazine industry operates, and what I found was missing was an alternate perspective to the glossy content consumers receive today.</p>
<p>This inspired me to create a publication that would test the very nature of the world we live in. It's pure beauty unchained. Instinct. Intelligence and wit. It's founders, audience and contributors must rethink all they know to be real in order to understand.</p>
<div>
<span class=""m-1r"">The publication sources inspiration from Ray Petri, who was a true visionary, a Renaissance man. He is most remembered for the impact he left as an image maker. He was a stylist before the term was coined, and his work depicted the norms and created a new culture. He surrounded himself with a team of like-minded individuals that became known as the Buffalo Collective. His work in <em>The Face</em> and <em>Honey</em> magazines in the 1980s depict imagery containing a soul and a story. “It was a reflection of what people wore; fashion as lifestyle,” said Roger Charity, a member of the Buffalo Collective. His life was brought to an abrupt end in 1987, but the impact of his work still resonates strongly through nearly every aspect of the industry. He was ahead of his time and truly revolutionary.</span>
<div>
<p>PETRI(E) Inventory 65 is a publication that steers away from the traditional and engages with readers in a real and relevant way visually and through text. It is a collectible, something that people will cherish and look back to from time to time, finding a different experience in it every time they look back. Each Inventory will have a unique soul. It will be united by a constant theme without being monotonous, allowing the reader to consider and explore a wide array of topics united by a common thread. “PETRI(E) Inventory 65 is a fear of the future, anxiety in the present and comfort from the past.” The publication is named for Petri because he embodies the progressive nature of the content. His acceptance of the other is exactly what PETRI(E) will celebrate. In 2013, Petri would have turned 65 so each issue, published annually, will age accordingly. The (E) remains intact, although Petri dropped it when he rose to fame as a stylist, because it represents a return to the core.</p>
<p>This publication is important to me because it offers a platform for creative individuals who normally may not have an outlet to showcase their work to be heard.  We want to inform, inspire and educate.  Everyone on the team is passionate about their craft and have committed to the vision and goal of PETRI(E).</p>
<p>For the first issue contributors have been sourced globally and include:</p>
<p>Edward Meadham and Benjamin Kirchoff of Meadham Kirchoff (London)</p>
<p>Photojournalist Saiful Huq Omi from Dhaka, Bangladesh</p>
<p>Photographers Lukasz Wierzbowski (Poland), Sam Rock (New York), Nicholas Bean (New York) and An Le (New York)</p>
<p>Dr. Valerie Steele (New York) of The Fashion Institute of Technology</p>
<p>Francesca Burns (London) of British Vogue</p>
<p>Barry Kamen (London) and Tony Felix(London) of the Buffalo Collective</p>
<p>Film Director and Photographer Nabil Elderkin (Los Angeles)</p>
<p>Desmond Zhengs (New York), Coco Ehni (London), Maria Pineda (Honduras), Yuko Sugimoto (London), Joseph Luck (London), Luis Ramirez (Florida), Liz McCarthy (Oxford), Katy Shields (London), Chloe Sexton (London), Larry Vrba (New York), Lucy Garrett (Oxford), James Wood (London), Andrew Logan (London), Colin Dawidziuk (London), Mila Nesterova (London), Valeriya Vygodnaya (London), Raeann Hayden (London), Sara Polonghini (London), Yevgeny (London), Vu (London), MJ (London) and more to be confirmed.</p>
<p>The content is quite varied and will include stories on politics, lifestyle, culture, art, fashion, poetry, photo and fashion editorials  and creative non-fiction.</p>
<p>The publication will be available in a limited edition run in select specialty book stores internationally.  From our humble beginnings, we hope to create a wave of interest and creativity that inspires others to do better than their supposed best.</p>
<p>The most difficult aspect of the publication is gathering all the funding to do this in a manner that is of highest quality.  There is so much effort being put into the content and it's important the content is exhibited in a professional and innovative format.</p>
<p>The most demanding costs are printing, to print a start run of 100 - 200 magazines it will cost approximately $4,000 </p>
<p>Other costs include production for photo and fashion editorials which are being shot in Savannah, Ga., Poland, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Bangkok, Japan and London.</p>
<p>To help cover the costs I have been paying for everything out of my own pocket.  I did not want contributors to have to pay, because they are investing time and money into their projects. However, even whilst working two part time jobs I am realising that I need help to reach the goal for print.</p>
<p>This is why we need you, to make this dream come true.  As this is the first edition of PETRI(E) there are not many physical perks we can offer.  However, our sincere gratitude will be extended. Every contributor will be mentioned and thanked personally in the magazine and receive a thank you letter from the team with a print of one of the images that will be published.  Also, for those contributors who are interested in receiving a copy of the magazine we will ensure that you receive a copy at a massive discount (it's hard to give a figure at the moment of how much the discount will be or actual cost of the publication will be, because we have to estimate this based on the print run, which we will have a better estimate of once we know funding numbers).  </p>
<p>No amount to contribute is too big or too small.  Please remember that every little bit helps.  A dollar starts with one penny.</p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute and even if you can, I ask that you please spread the word to your friends, family or colleagues who you think might be interested in helping.</p>
<p>Life is short and we only live once.  So, live it doing what you love.</p>
<p>To Inspire, To Inform, To Educate</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

His work in The Face and Honey magazines in the 1980s depict imagery containing a soul and a story. “It was a reflection of what people wore; fashion as lifestyle,” said Roger Charity, a member of the Buffalo Collective. His life was brought to an abrupt end in 1987, but the impact of his work still resonates strongly through nearly every aspect of the industry. He was ahead of his time and truly revolutionary.

PETRI(E) Inventory 65 is a publication that steers away from the traditional and engages with readers in a real and relevant way visually and through text. It is a collectible, something that people will cherish and look back to from time to time, finding a different experience in it every time they look back. Each Inventory will have a unique soul. It will be united by a constant theme without being monotonous, allowing the reader to consider and explore a wide array of topics united by a common thread. “PETRI(E) Inventory 65 is a fear of the future, anxiety in the present and comfort from the past.” The publication is named for Petri because he embodies the progressive nature of the content. His acceptance of the other is exactly what PETRI(E) will celebrate. In 2013, Petri would have turned 65 so each issue, published annually, will age accordingly. The (E) remains intact, although Petri dropped it when he rose to fame as a stylist, because it represents a return to the core.
This publication is important to me because it offers a platform for creative individuals who normally may not have an outlet to showcase their work to be heard.  We want to inform, inspire and educate.  Everyone on the team is passionate about their craft and have committed to the vision and goal of PETRI(E).
For the first issue contributors have been sourced globally and include:

The content is quite varied and will include stories on politics, lifestyle, culture, art, fashion, poetry, photo and fashion editorials  and creative non-fiction.
The publication will be available in a limited edition run in select specialty book stores internationally.  From our humble beginnings, we hope to create a wave of interest and creativity that inspires others to do better than their supposed best.
The most difficult aspect of the publication is gathering all the funding to do this in a manner that is of highest quality.  There is so much effort being put into the content and it's important the content is exhibited in a professional and innovative format.
The most demanding costs are printing, to print a start run of 100 - 200 magazines it will cost approximately $4,000 
Other costs include production for photo and fashion editorials which are being shot in Savannah, Ga., Poland, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Bangkok, Japan and London.
To help cover the costs I have been paying for everything out of my own pocket.  I did not want contributors to have to pay, because they are investing time and money into their projects. However, even whilst working two part time jobs I am realising that I need help to reach the goal for print.
This is why we need you, to make this dream come true.  As this is the first edition of PETRI(E) there are not many physical perks we can offer.  However, our sincere gratitude will be extended. Every contributor will be mentioned and thanked personally in the magazine and receive a thank you letter from the team with a print of one of the images that will be published.  Also, for those contributors who are interested in receiving a copy of the magazine we will ensure that you receive a copy at a massive discount (it's hard to give a figure at the moment of how much the discount will be or actual cost of the publication will be, because we have to estimate this based on the print run, which we will have a better estimate of once we know funding numbers).  
No amount to contribute is too big or too small.  Please remember that every little bit helps.  A dollar starts with one penny.
If you are unable to contribute and even if you can, I ask that you please spread the word to your friends, family or colleagues who you think might be interested in helping.
Life is short and we only live once.  So, live it doing what you love.
