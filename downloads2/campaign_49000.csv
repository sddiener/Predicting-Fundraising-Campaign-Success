<h3>HELLO INDIEGOGO!</h3>
<p>I'm Jack, and I'd like to present to you the Key-Z! The next evolution of key holders.</p>
<p>The Key-Z is made with a non-slip, non-abrasive silicone. It is shorter than a deck of cards, as wide as a dollar bill and as thin as 3 stacked house keys. It will change your life FOREVER! </p>
<p>Silicone is soft enough not to damage surrounding objects, yet durable enough to withstand extreme conditions.</p>
<p>It's so thin, it will practically dissappear from view when in your pocket, eliminating those pesky bulges generic keychains are notorious for.</p>
<p>I am a minimalist, I like it when things are simple. But for those who like to add and customize, the Key-Z can accommodate you! There's room for easy expansion like a money clip, card slot or custom usb drive.... the possibilities are seriously endless!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your donations will go towards manufacturing. Then, I will approach major brands and retailers in order to help get the Key-Z into everybody's hands. I TRULY feel that the Key-Z will help declutter the world, and appreciate your help in accomplishing my goal.</p>
<p>$27,000 is needed for the first run, this includes packaging and shipping. I have also allocated funds for online presence and marketing.</p>
<p>By pledging, not only do you have the opportunity to be the first to own a Key-Z, you can also promote a business or brand like never before!</p>
<p>The Key-Z makes a great gift, too!</p>
<p>If this campaign is not 100% successful, you will be refunded by Indiegogo. You can feel comfortable knowing that your pledge is actually going towards something.</p>
<p>If you pledge to receive a Key-Z, you will have the option of voting on the color! The top 4 color choices will be produced.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I know that not everyone needs the Key-Z, but I do know that we all have that ONE friend with the bundle of jingles at their hip. All I ask is that you tell them about it! Do it via Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, the phone, your blog, anywhere! There are awesome share tools right on this page to make it nice and easy for you!</p>

The F-14 made its first deployment in 1974 aboard USS Enterprise (CVN-65).The F-14 is one of the most famous and loved aircraft in Naval Aviation history, and many remember the movie The Final Countdown and also the Topgun movie where the F-14 has a leading role.In May 1944, the first VF-84 squadron was formed from veterans of VF-17 (the original ""Jolly Rogers""). VF-84 took part in WWII in Japan, at that time they flew the F4U Corsair.VF-17 Jolly Rogers - F4U CorsairUnfortunately, VF-84 was disestablished because of heavy losses and established again later in 1955, now flying the FJ-3 Fury.After different airplanes like Demon and Phantom in the VF-84 fighter squadron, early in 1976 the F-14 Tomcat arrived at the squadron and flew until 1995 after that VF-103 Jolly Rogers took over the planes.Later the F/A-18 Hornet and F/A-18 super hornet replaced the F-14 Tomcat and a lot of F-14 were sold to Iran, who still use them. There is no F-14 Tomcat in Europe at any museum, only US museums have them displayed.VF A-103 Jolly Rogers - Flying F/A-18 Super Hornet Photo Credit: Rich Cooper/COAPPicture from an early backer - Call sign Rock - Picture is from 1989, visiting a German Tornado II officer club in Northern Germany. Color and design options Inspired by Top Gun and Mavericks helmet, we have made another 3 color designs to choose from based on the same case. The original F-14 Jolly Rogers comes with a glass bead blasted case, where the Maverick inspired comes with a stainless steel 316L case with a special Blue PVD treatment, similar to the Maverick blue helmet color.The other options come with a stainless steel 316L brushed case, all have the Seiko NH35 automatic movement. The one with the Tomcat logo, has a Horween leather strap.3 out of 4 F-14 Tomcat color/design options shownPitot F-14 Blue PVD - color design inspired by Top Gun​ and Mavericks helmetBlue/Red with brushed caseF-14 with original Tomcat logoInspired by the key features from the F-14 Tomcat Crowdfunding to build up a brandSince our first crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to fund the prototype developing, I have run 4 campaign total and build up a great community around the brand Pitot Watches, ""Watches inspired by fighter jets"".A lot of backers have supported us, friends have emerged in the development of the watches across oceans and country borders.  There has been a lot of work and long hours at the office, and the project seemed hopeless at one point where my wife was diagnosed with cancer and we had to survive and recover together.We have come a long way, and my mission to build 20-30 fighter jet-inspired watches started with the F-16 inspired watch in early 2018. We have now designed in total 7 different watch designs and 4 prototypes have seen the day so far.With my passion and the feedback from all over the world, help from friends, family, and strangers, who also believe in this and our designs, I have never for one moment had any doubt that this would be a success.We build aviator watches and we share that passion with other aviator and watch lovers, and together we build not only a community, but a company that delivers high-quality watches and the design is getting better for each new watch we develop.With your support, we not only deliver a specially designed watch to you, but we also build up a new company that will make jobs for marketing, design, sales and webshop experts.Best regards Thomas Clausen Watch dataThe NH35A is currently one of the world’s most popular automatic movements and is widely available in many affordable/microbrands.Seiko NH35 can be also be found in watches like Invicta, Boldr, Vostok, Spinnaker, and DELTAt.Movement Type: Automatic - Jewels: 24 - Vibrations Per Hour: 21,600 BPH - Power Reserve: 41 hours - Winding direction: Bi-directional - Hacking?: Yes - Handwindable: Yes - Functions: Hours, minutes, seconds, date calendar.Future workWe are working on an F-16 and F/A-18 Hornet watch with swiss movement, also we are preparing a Pilot watch in cooperation with a US-based pilot who will do the flight test in the development phase in an F5 Tiger. DevelopmentFirst sketches being made after long research and mood board inspiration of the F14 Tomcat VF84 Jolly Rogers - We decided to move on with nr 1 from leftThe big air intake inspired the cutout with black PVD steel inserts on the side of the watch to give it some depth.2D final design before 3D startFrom the 2D layout we made it into 3D in Solidworks - to have the watch in 3D with all parts, made it easy for us to show the factory what we want.​Here the 2D lumen to the dialSome of the inspirationAfter 3D ready - we made a test 3D print in plastic to get a feel of dimensions and shape NOTE: Watches will be numbered, but since we had run multiple crowdfunding campaigns on another platform to help with prototype making, the first numbered watches are already reserved.NOTE: Iceblue will not go into production (Change to other model or get a refund)Risks and challengesThere is always a risk when backing a project - We have been strict when choosing the factory we decided to work together with, and the prototypes have been flawless in the first attempt! We make the watches from scratch, and control all dimensions and look, by making the 3D parts ourself, so they are ready 100% for production and eliminate mistake in design. Corona could delay the project a bit - companies in China are back to work, but other companies in the shipping area could still affect the delivery time.",55.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<p>804 Industries (804industries.com) was founded by Morgan Davis and Stuart Burgh in <strong>Richmond, VA</strong> with the hopes of providing people with an awesome pair of shoes, at a great price, while helping people in the process. They loved the idea of giving back like companies such as TOMS, but they never loved the product. So, they thought “Let’s do something similar, but just different enough to fit our own tastes.” They borrowed from classic styles like the “Sperry” Boat Shoe and the TOMs classics and merged the two to present a style for those of us who never really loved either, but had to settle for one or the other in the past.  We want you to have a shoe you can wear with ANYTHING and we think we did that.</p>
<p>Our company gives back for every purchase you make, but not to any one cause. We know most people feel great giving back, but we also know people have an opinion as to where their money goes, so we devised a system where the BUYER gets to choose where his or her donation goes.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty simple concept; you pick a color and we donate to a cause.</p>

<p>We wanted a shoe that any one could wear (guys or girls), with anything, and for any occasion. We wanted to retain a classy feel, but with a bit of a casual swag. Not so casual that you couldn't wear them out to dinner, but not so upscale that you would be worried about getting your kicks dirty at the local bar.</p>

<p><em>The shoes fit smaller than most (comparable to the fit of a Nike athletic shoe), so if you are in between sizes go with the larger size. </em><em>But, they are also canvas and will break in after a few wears and get bigger or mold to your feet similar to TOMS. If you're a half size, we recommend moving up rather than down! So, for example if you're normally a 10.5 go with 11 rather than 10. <strong>All the shoes are also cut the same, so if you're a girl who needs a larger size, a men's size minus 2  roughly equals a woman's size in US standards!

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>1. How donations work</strong></p>
<p>Transparency is our goal here, so we'll keep you in the loop as we go. Please note that even some of the most charitable companies out there only donate about 4% of their profits to charity. For this effort <b>10% of profits</b> will be donated to your charity of choice.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p>If you are concerned with any of this, please know that we have been working with most of these charities for a few months now and they have all of our cost data. Our charity partners know exactly how much we make and will receive updates as our costs decrease.  So, if this is your concern, we’re sure if you contact them directly they’ll say we’re good people. <strong>We plan on making our donations public once we make them. </strong></p>
<p>We will be making donations as soon as we receive our funds, and, later on, once the shoes are shipped, any cost savings we have will be relayed to our charities and corresponding additional donations will be made.</p>
<p>If you would rather just donate directly to any of these causes and don’t want shoes please visit their site directly, all of which can be found in each “cause” section of our page! </p>
<p><strong>2. When/How do I pick my colors?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Once we raise the funds we will send you an email asking for your color choices. </strong>Simply tell us your color and size choices for your shoes/shirt. You get to pick any of the three shoe colors and any lace color you want. ALL SHOES COME WITH BROWN STRINGS IN ADDITION TO YOUR COLORED STRING CHOICE, so you can choose to rock Brown or a Color.</p>
<p><strong>3. When will I get my shoes?</strong></p>
<p><span>It all depends on how soon we meet our goals. We are hoping to receive the shoes 75 days from the end of the campaign, once we do we ship them back out to you. So, if we raise the money early and we can order early, we can get them to ASAP! Sounds like a long time, but most shoe projects we've seen on Kickstarter and Indiegogo take much much longer. We will do everything in our power to keep you up to date on shipping. Remember, this is our very first production run, so bear with us!</span></p>
<p><strong>4. Ok, so will you make donations before or after I get my shoes?</strong></p>
<p><span>We'll make the donations as soon as we hit our funding goal. We know some of our causes really need their money to get started on some amazing work, so we will make all the donations the day the campaign ends.</span></p>
<p><strong>5. Where the the shoes manufactured?</strong></p>
<p>Everything is designed in Richmond, Va. We've been working hard to get our designs perfect for the last year.</p>
<p>Our shoes are assembled in Fujian, China. The facility has passed the SA8000 (Social Accountability) audit. Furthermore, our manufacturing facility has passed The Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) Monitoring System audit. If you would like more information on this system please see the link, <a href=""http://www.bsci-intl.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bsci-intl.org/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>6. They're canvas I know, so will they break in?</strong></p>
<p><span>Yes they will. They do run small, so we do recommend if you wear a half size to move up rather than down. But, just like your favorite pair of jeans, the canvas is begin to break in over time, stretch, and will get more and more comfy the more you wear them. </span></p>
<p><strong>7. To sock or not to sock? That is the question</strong></p>
<p>Your call. The canvas is a bit stiff the first one or two times you wear them. We rocked socks the first couple times, but once they got broken in we were sock free. Really all depends on your style. The canvas breathes well, so they shouldn't get too stinky. </p>
<p><strong>8. I'm not in the country. Can I still get these awesome shoes?</strong></p>
<p>O yea, we got you covered. Shipping overseas can be pricey, so we included the costs in the perk boxes above. Please see the perk boxes and they'll let you know how much extra you will need to add to your pledge if you live overseas. W<span>e are not responsible for customs duties and procedures.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><span>9. Your T-Shirts are pretty amazing too. How do they fit?</span></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>We are using American Apparel Ts. Plenty of stores sell them, so ask a local retailer and you can try one on. They fit more like an athletic fit T-Shirt rather than a ""beefy"" T.</p>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>10. When does the other stuff ship?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>Stickers should be out within the week of the end of the fundraiser and Ts will be out within the month. </p>
<p><strong>11. Can I get extra strings if I want them?</strong></p>
<p>OF COURSE. For every additional $5 you add to a shoe based donation you get another pair of strings and we'll make another donation! Strings don't cost us too much extra to produce, so for these we donate 50% of our profits from string sales rather than 10-15%. </p>
<p>Also, remember you can put the strings in any shoes you wear, even if they aren't ours!</p>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>12. I'm interested in whole sale or a large purchase, can I contact you directly?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>Sure, shoot us an email at 804contact@gmail.com. We'll send you the specifics.<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><span> </span></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>13. I work for a charity/cause and would love to be a part of this campaign. Can I join in?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>ABSOLUTELY. Just shoot us and email and we'll work out a color and add you to the campaign. Please note that we use categories, so we would prefer causes which fit into categories we haven't used yet. Examples being education, domestic public service, or military. </p>
<p><strong>14. Who plays that awesome song in your video?</strong></p>
<p>A band named Allay. Check them out on facebook. Good friends of ours and a killer band!</p>
<p> </p></div>","Real Simple Style:

The green strings in the Navy shoes above are not as floppy in real life! And, are also brighter. We were using sample strings for the shoot! Sorry for the confusion

FOR THOSE OF YOU WONDERING, you will make your color and size choices once we reach our goal. We will send you an email and you tell us what colors you want!
If we do NOT raise the money and cannot make the shoes, you get all of your money BACK. Please help us reach our goal! 
------------------------------------------------
Comfortable 'Boat' Style Shoe For Guys And Girls that gives to a cause/charity of your choice every time you buy!
Their shoe was made for the boat, ours was made to make a difference.
Humble Beginnings:

804 Industries (804industries.com) was founded by Morgan Davis and Stuart Burgh in Richmond, VA with the hopes of providing people with an awesome pair of shoes, at a great price, while helping people in the process. They loved the idea of giving back like companies such as TOMS, but they never loved the product. So, they thought “Let’s do something similar, but just different enough to fit our own tastes.” They borrowed from classic styles like the “Sperry” Boat Shoe and the TOMs classics and merged the two to present a style for those of us who never really loved either, but had to settle for one or the other in the past.  We want you to have a shoe you can wear with ANYTHING and we think we did that.
Our company gives back for every purchase you make, but not to any one cause. We know most people feel great giving back, but we also know people have an opinion as to where their money goes, so we devised a system where the BUYER gets to choose where his or her donation goes.
It’s a pretty simple concept; you pick a color and we donate to a cause.

Our second product to hit the market hopefully will be our Boulevard Shoe. 
WE NEED YOUR HELP TO RAISE ENOUGH MONEY TO MEET MINIMUM COSTS FOR OUR FIRST PRODUCTION RUN.
Like jeans for your feet!
 

We borrowed inspiration from the classic boat shoe style, but made a few minor modifications to make it a shoe of our own. We know that plenty of companies have made modifications to this classic style in the past, but no one seems to have gotten it right, until now. 


We wanted a shoe that any one could wear (guys or girls), with anything, and for any occasion. We wanted to retain a classy feel, but with a bit of a casual swag. Not so casual that you couldn't wear them out to dinner, but not so upscale that you would be worried about getting your kicks dirty at the local bar.

 
This shoe was made for the young professional, the hipster, the prepster, and everyone in between. We hope to make a shoe for everyone who doesn't exactly fit into one category...
If you have any issues viewing our moving GIF images above, please click on the ""Gallery"" tab above for shots of every color available!

We need $27K in order to meet our minimum production quantities, so without your donation we will not be able to produce any shoes! Please help us meet our minimums so you can get a pair of 804's!
The Specs:
Uni Sex - Perfect for Guys and Girls!

Colors - 
You have 3 great colors to choose from.
 

Canvas Exterior - 
The canvas makes the shoe extremely durable. We've been wearing sample pairs ever day for the last 6 months and we've yet to have any rips, breaks, or tears. We also have NO FRAYS. Some people like the frayed look, but personally we like the clean cut look of our shoes. The canvas holds up really well, feels great, and looks even better.
 
Low Key Sole -
This is most important aspect for us. We love the height of our soles.  We stuck with a short, low key sole, at .5 inches you don't get that ""gummy"" look that comes along with some similar shoes.
 

Comfort -
We added additional padding to our shoes to make them nice and comfy. We also have a striped lining on the inside of the shoe.

No Rear Laces - 
Pretty straight forward. We never loved the rear/side laces on most boat style shoes, so we got rid of them.

A Suede Upper Heel -
The upper portion of our heel has a nice patch of suede leather which adds a nice contrast to the heels of the shoe.
 
 
SIZES WE CURRENTLY HAVE AVAILABLE. WITH YOUR BACKING WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE. 
 
The shoes fit smaller than most (comparable to the fit of a Nike athletic shoe), so if you are in between sizes go with the larger size. But, they are also canvas and will break in after a few wears and get bigger or mold to your feet similar to TOMS. If you're a half size, we recommend moving up rather than down! So, for example if you're normally a 10.5 go with 11 rather than 10. All the shoes are also cut the same, so if you're a girl who needs a larger size, a men's size minus 2  roughly equals a woman's size in US standards! Example: Men's 8 = Woman's 10.
Two Sets of Strings With Every Pair FOR CHARITY -
Every pair comes with the standard brown strings, but also a free colored additional pair of your choice. We have Green, Light Blue, Red, Orange, Light Gray/Silver, White, and Pink to choose from. 
Each color represents a different charity to which we donate 10-15% of profits! Please see below for more information and see our Q&A section all the way down for even more info.
The pictures below are GIFs and should be moving like a slide show. If your browser cannot load them, please click the 'Gallery' tab up top to see all the color combinations!



 
 

 Charity:


How it works? You buy a pair, we make a donation. It's that simple. 
When you buy you get the standard brown pair of shoe strings, but you ALSO get to choose a FREE PAIR of extra stings in either Bright Green, Light Blue, Orange, Red, Light Gray, White, and Pink. Each color represents a different cause, so the color you choose denotes where your money goes! 
The Colors and The Causes:
We hope that we can help as many people as possible! So, we picked several categories of causes. We may rotate them in the future, but for now the causes below are the causes that receive 10-15% of all of our profits. 
Hi Res shots of every color combo can be seen in our gallery.
Green 


For every pair purchased with Green Strings we donate funds to the International Tree Foundation. Yep, a percentage of profits go to planting trees! Why trees, well they clean the air, provide us with a food source, help add nutrients to the soil, and can even be used for some medicines!
For every 15 pairs sold, depending on site chosen, between 1 and 6 trees will be planted.

 
The International Tree Foundation works with communities in Africa to carry out sustainable community forestry projects which help to increase their income, food security and soil and water quality through growing trees. Their projects also protect and regenerate trees and forests, providing protection for the environment and atmosphere as well as habitats for rich biodiversity.

Blue

 
When you pick blue, you are quenching someone's thirst for clean water. We are donating 10% of profits to charity: water, which specializes in providing clean water to people all around the world. Every time you buy a pair, money goes to getting thirsty people a drink.
 

charity: water is a non-profit organization bringing clean and safe drinking water to people in developing nations.

Orange
 
 
You can't forget about the kids! Every donation made when you pick Orange Shoe Strings helps kids fight cancer!


Pick orange and we make a donation to the Rally Foundation. Rally Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, empowers volunteers across the country to raise awareness and funds for childhood cancer research to find better treatments with fewer long-term side effects and, ultimately, cures.
In preperation for Childhood Cancer Month, which is September (roughly when you'll receive your shoes), we will also be offering a BONUS color, YELLOW, that you will also receive whenever you choose to donate to the Rally Foundation. So, you will get not one, but TWO extra pairs of strings and you can choose to wear either color to support this great cause!

Red

 

 
If you choose RED for every pair purchased we donate to a ""Health"" related cause. This category ranges from curing disease to helping people cope with living with an ailment to helping the wounded. Or, it could be anything in between.
Every pair of shoelaces sold helps fund essential Davis Phinney Foundation programs.
 Ten pairs of shoelaces provides one person in need with a copy of the Every Victory Counts® self-care manual. Forty pairs make it possible for someone to spend a full day hearing top Parkinson's experts, being inspired and learning to how to improve their quality of life at The Victory Summit. Just one pair of shoelaces helps pay for educational webinars, scientific research, national symposia and other vital tools that make it possible for people with Parkinson's disease to take action against their disease and to live well today.

The Foundation provides essential information, practical tools and inspiration to people living with Parkinson’s and funds research closely aligned with our mission – improving the lives of people living with Parkinson’s.
Light Gray/Silver

 

 
Proceeds go to providing musical instruments to organizations across the United States, including schools, community based nonprofits and music therapy programs.

Donations will be made to the Fender Music Foundation. If you would like to skip over our campaign and donate directly, you may visit them directly here: http://www.fendermusicfoundation.org/.
*We would like to stipulate that we are not official partners with this organization. But, we do think they are doing an amazing job with aiding ailing music programs all over the country and that's why we want to help them out as much as we can!
Pink

 
$2.50 from each shoe purchased will be donated to The Breast Cancer Research Foundation® (BCRF), dedicated to preventing breast cancer and finding a cure in our lifetime by funding clinical and translational research worldwide.
If you choose to purchase extra strings, we will make an additional donation of $2.30 to BCRF for each additional string set purchased.

White
 

Some causes don't stick to just one thing like health, clean water, or education. Some causes do a little bit of EVERYTHING, bringing in all the help they can to better the lives of the people with which they work in any way possible. We made up a special category for these causes, the ones that don’t really fit into any other category, known as DEVELOPEMENT.
This campaigns cause is the Local Development Catalyst Network, LDCN.
Local Development Catalyst Network
 
Local Development Catalyst Network, LDCN, is an innovative community based Non-Profit that was founded in the spring of 2011 by American Zachary Lager.  Through his academic studies and development work around the world, Zachary recognized a strong disconnect between impoverished African’s needs and the mainstream development system’s response to those needs.  
The goal of the LDCN is to offer environmentally sustainable, economically beneficial, and culturally relevant solutions to the challenges impoverished Africans face on a daily basis, thus improving the local quality of life and stimulating a continuous and positive shift in how Africans perceive and experience the world and their environment.

FAQs
1. How donations work
Transparency is our goal here, so we'll keep you in the loop as we go. Please note that even some of the most charitable companies out there only donate about 4% of their profits to charity. For this effort 10% of profits will be donated to your charity of choice. 
If you are concerned with any of this, please know that we have been working with most of these charities for a few months now and they have all of our cost data. Our charity partners know exactly how much we make and will receive updates as our costs decrease.  So, if this is your concern, we’re sure if you contact them directly they’ll say we’re good people. We plan on making our donations public once we make them. 
We will be making donations as soon as we receive our funds, and, later on, once the shoes are shipped, any cost savings we have will be relayed to our charities and corresponding additional donations will be made.
If you would rather just donate directly to any of these causes and don’t want shoes please visit their site directly, all of which can be found in each “cause” section of our page!

Once we raise the funds we will send you an email asking for your color choices. Simply tell us your color and size choices for your shoes/shirt.

<p><b>The larger size matters:  </b></p>
<p>The Vortex Shadow is the larger version of the Vortex Shield, launched in 2015. The same design, now with more room for take everything you need. </p>
<p><b>We are still offering the Vortex Shield in this campaign in order to work offer folks who want a smaller version of the Shadow. Feel free to pick it up if you want an amazing piece that is half the size of the Shadow.</b></p>
<p>Our previous bag, the Vortex Shield, launched on Kickstarter in 2015 with great success. But it also launched a larger discussion about what our backers wanted and needed in a bag. The original Vortex Shield was beautiful but some felt it lacked storage space for larger devices like tablets.  </p>
<p>So, what did we do? We listened. And thus, the Vortex Shadow was born, the result of years of hard work and community input. Now, we’ve created a bag that holds all the stuff you need. The Vortex Shadow does it all and it’s even more beautiful than before.</p>

<p>One of the best things about the Vortex is it's size, grab it with you effortlessly on a long trip and stash everything you need in it or grab it for a short urban adventure.

<p> There are easier ways to make leather bags, there are a million ways to cut corners. We just choose not to cut ANY corners and to make every bag by hand, that's just who we are. This allows us to keep our production close, make changes as needed and make sure that quality control is tight as possible. We've learned from our previous projects and maintain the highest quality of workmanship and materials in a handmade workshop. Simple. Its how we role.</p>

<p>  <b>Why we made the Vortex Shadow and how it's different from the Vortex Shield</b></p>
<p>Think of the Vortex Shield as a niche product, one that allows you to carry just what you need but not everything you want. Now consider that Vortex Shadow, it's a full-sized sling that can carry twice as much as the original Vortex but still remain slim and classy. There two bags complete each other. The larger Vortex Shadow was created from the original Vortex project from 2015 and with all that we have learned and all of your feedback we created the next level, the Vortex Shadow. See on the top of the page all of the sessions we ran here on Kickstarter to learn from our backers and create the bag you see here now. Available in Black and in Tan.</p>
<p><b>LEFT-HANDED BAG LOVERS, DON’T DESPAIR </b></p>
<p>We got you covered, once we have more than 10 people who ask for a left-handed version it will be offered as an official option. In order to make this happen, just pick up one Vortex shadow and put in the comments that you want the lefty version. Our guess is that we will have a ton of orders so once we cross the 10 pieces we will have a lefty product run.  </p>

Kaptur is… Whatever you want it to be.
We wanted to capture, (see what we did there), the way we communicate in the internet era and create a hat that was as customizable as the background on your phone.
So what can you do with Kaptur?

Show off fire memes!
Support your favorite sports team  (and when they lose, support your next favorite sports team)
Have an awesome clip of your favorite band? Loop it! 
Want to let people know you’re deep in thought? There’s a GIF for that.  

We know you'll think of hundreds of different and creative ways you'll want to express yourself.

 
The Kaptur App
Speaking of the Kaptur App, what good is a hat with a screen if you can’t upload content to it? The app is the perfect companion to Kaptur, with all the features you need to upload, organize, and share your content.
Using the Kaptur App, create a playlist of media and share it with other Kaptur users!

With the app, you can create your own image library and tag it with keywords, or sort them by category.  You’ll be able to discover other users to share content with and follow creators that you love! It will all be part of the shared experience that is Kaptur, plus we’ll be adding more features as we go through the campaign!

<p>Lets share Jo's artwork with the world and show people our passion for marine life whilst we're at it. Art isn't only to be admired on gallery walls - why not wear beautiful art on a hand printed, eco-friendly T-shirt!</p>
<p><strong><i>How are the shirts eco friendly?</i></strong></p>
<p>We've found a supplier of organic cotton T-shirts (<strong>free of plastic micro-fibres</strong>) produced using responsible social practices and renewable energy. The <a href=""https://www.continentalclothing.com/home/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'Earth Positive' T-shirts</a> will be <a href=""http://www.carillionprint.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hand screen printed</a> in Bristol, UK and shipped directly to you using as little plastic packaging as we can. </p>

<p>At the end of the campaign we'll send you a survey asking for which cut (M/F), colour and size combination you would like. We will then send them out. </p>
<p><strong><i>Why run an Indiegogo campaign for T-shirts - why not do a bulk print and sell them individually?</i></strong></p>
<p>Consumer clothing produces an incredible amount of waste, some of which ends up in our oceans. The global average consumption of textiles is around 13kg per person, per year. Along the production chain there can be negative effects from agricultural practices, emissions of chemicals and plastic micro-fibres, and poor working conditions in factories. It sounds unthinkable, but a large portion of the budget fashion produced every year never ends up being worn before it enters landfill.</p>

<p>We want to ensure that any T-shirts we get made have as positive an impact on the people and environment as possible. For this to work, we need them all to go on to a happy new owner, with none left unworn or discarded as 'fashion waste'.

<p><strong><i>What if you get more than 25 T-shirt orders? Will you run out?</i></strong></p>
<p>No, we won't run out - we won't take your money or print the shirts if we don't get 25 orders, but we would love to print more. If you're a supporter and we make or exceed our goal, you won't miss out on a shirt.</p>
<p><strong><i>Where will our money go?</i></strong></p>
<p>Most of the funding will go towards actually purchasing and printing the T-shirts, since this is a minimum run. About 30% of each shirt sale will go towards collaborating on the next set of commissioned artworks with Jo Brown.</p>
<p>If we exceed our initial goal of funding 25 shirts, the cost of printing begins to decrease. <strong>If we get more than 25 orders, we'll donate 2.5% of the proceeds to <a href=""http://oceana.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Oceana</a>, a charity which campaigns for global Ocean Conservation at a community level.</strong> If we pass 100 shirts we will increase this to 5%; at 150 shirts, 7.5%; for 200 shirts, 10%, and so on to a maximum of 20% of the overall funding.</p>

<p>We are a husband (Mike) and wife (Chandra) team that are natives of Colorado. We love this state so much, that we named our business after it (Colorado means <a href=""https://www.coloredredleathergoods.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Colored Red</a> in Spanish). Our business started out with the Mrs. making bracelets, in the summer of 2015. She wanted a creative outlet, as well as the ability to offer quality goods at an affordable price. This quickly turned into us working together, and we shifted our focus to leather goods that are suitable for various styles and various ages.</p>
<p>The Bison Bifold was created out of Mike's desire to have a wallet that can house multiple cards and cash, while not becoming bulky. The Bison fits that need perfectly, and is a great alternative to the bifold of yesteryear. It can house 16 credit cards and several bills, while maintaining a slimmer thickness than many other bifold wallets. We then were able to design the Bison 2, which allows you to keep your passport safely tucked away with your cards and cash. </p>
<p>The Dillon minimalist wallet was born out of Chandra's need to have a way to carry the minimum, of necessities, when on the go with our 2, young daughters. The Dillon serves just that purpose. She is able to take a few cards, a few bills, and just go. No need to always carry a big wallet, or a bag to hold the wallet in. The Dillon is a great fit in the front pocket, back pocket, and shirt pockets.</p>
<p>In this day in age, the majority of goods are mass produced and of poor quality. That is why each one of our pieces are hand cut, hand assembled, hand stitched, hand finished, and, in some cases, hand dyed. Along with making each piece by hand, we only use high quality materials to ensure your leather goods will last. We are passionate about what we do, and thoroughly enjoy making each piece.</p>

</div><p>Thank you so much for all of your support from all of us at FCT Network Fund and cities in conflict around the world &lt;3 </p></div>","Short Summary - shop for a cause!
Imagine a magical online shop where you can buy shirts, bags, socks and more and every time you buy an item the money goes to help grassroots projects in cities in conflict. Not only that but the incredible items you are buying are designed by artists, designers and illustrators local to the cities we are helping. But wait, there's more! All the items will be sustainable and have organic, circular and renewable goals in mind during the manufacturing process. 

What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise £2500 to make our dream to build peace and community in divided societies through the FCT shop a reality. 
What you get:
- £25 - shoutout on social media 
- £50 - a tote bag 
- £100 - an FCT-shirt 
- £1000 - An FCT-shirt, a tote bag, and we will livestream a party for you on our Instagram

The Impact
The FCT Network Fund (a brand name of Foundation NI) supports a dynamic network of people living in extreme circumstances and fragile political environments who wish to build a better and more peaceful future. 
We wish to involve local artists, designers and illustrators from these cities to produce FCT-shirts, FCTbags and other FCTwear in order to sell in our FCTshop. These profits will then go to grassroots projects in cities in conflict. FCT Cities include:

- Derry / London-Derry (The Derry Model)
- Jerusalem, Israel (The Women's Hub, Mini Active, Atta'a Centre and Good Neighbors)
- Kaduna, Nigeria (The Peace Pitch Project)
- Kirkuk, Iraq (INSAN Project)
- Tripoli, Lebanon (Social Innovation Hub)

Big team of professionals and people, who contributed their experience and energy to the creation of the best product for you, worked on this bag. However, we would want to tell you about Polina – the mastermind of this project.",33.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>ABOUT</strong></p>
<p>Sarsen derives its unique view from the experiences of the designer, Heather Ellrod.  Growing up in Seattle has helped create her dark aesthetic message; an edgy and mysterious interpretation of her alternative roots.  After a decade in the retail industry Heather pursued her dream of creating her own collection.</p>
<p>Sarsen is a collection that is sleek, simple, and stark- impossible to avoid.  It is inspired by clean shapes with elegant lines.  The range of garments varies from impeccably tailored coats and jackets to uniquely designed dresses and tops.  The constant throughout the collection is the sultry mystery that is evoked from each piece.  </p>
<p>This Fall will debut my first collection and I need your help funding production!  Without your support I won't be able to produce these styles I have been working on for the last year.  So take a look at the gallery, if you see anything you like, please pre-order it from the list to the right!  If we meet the goal I will be able to produce your order!</p>

<p>The Elka Synthex has long been loved and missed by both musicians and enthusiasts alike. Originally produced between 1981 and 1984, its iconic eightnote polyphony sound defined a generation of music across genres, from the pure electronica of Jean–Michel Jarre, through the stadium rock of Asia and Duran Duran, to the urban funk of Stevie Wonder. In reissuing this coveted instrument, Soundion wants to provide Elka Synthex aficionados around the world with a new opportunity to own one of these timeless classics at a fair price. </p>

The legendary Elka Synthex synthesiser is making a comeback in 2015. Originally produced from 1981 to 1985, only a small number of this iconic synthesiser were ever made. Now it's making a comeback – and you can make it happen. 
The Elka Synthex has an incredible sound that’s landed it a spot in the synthesiser hall of fame – one of only forty instruments in the world. It’s sound can be heard on some of the 20th century’s best-loved albums. And now you can make it yours.







The Elka Synthex is a polyphonic synthesiser that is capable of eight-note polyphony. In order to achieve this, the Elka Synthex comes with eight monophonic synthesiser circuits – all vintage parts. 
The Elka Synthex is completely programmable, enabling you to save sounds you’ve created for future use. A wide array of pre-sets are also supplied with the instrument, making this one of the most versatile vintage synths out there. 








The reissued Elka Synthex synthesisers will be hand-built in Salo, Finland, using a combination of vintage and new components. This way we can ensure that the reissue has that signature Elka sound and user interface that Elka fans love, while making use of technological advances that improve its efficiency.


The Elka Synthex had an original design that stood out from anything that had come before it.  This will be true of the reissue as well: the reissued Elka Synthex comes with the original user interface design, including the iconic joystick controller, ensuring that all controls are within easy reach.

The Elka Synthex is one of the most sought-after synthesisers out there. With careful sound design and innovative build, it’s a true musical instrument that’s stood the test of time. And today, it sounds as fresh as it did in 1981.
Jean-Michel Jarre still owns three working Synthexes which he uses to this day both in the studio and live on tour. They have been used on every new album since Rendezvous in 1985 – the album on which the iconic use of Synthex with the laser harp first was heard.

Keith Emerson's famous GX-1 Fanfare For The Common Man sound was recreated on the Synthex, and he bought one to use live for that piece and other songs on the 1985 World tour with ELP.

Synthex was on Stevie Wonder's Characters album and on the Skeletons hit single. Wonder ordered the final machine left in stock at Elka, and picked it up on his 1986 European tour. He used it to replace his ailing GX-1 and live on his 1987 world tour.
The Synthex appears on the soundtrack of the movie Die Hard in the track playing in the limousine scene by Stevie Wonder.
When Asia keyboard player Geoff Downes (ex-Buggles, ex-Yes) bought a Synthex and used it extensively on the 3rd Asia album in 1983, singer/bass player John Wetton (ex-King Crimson, Ex-Roxy Music) liked the sound of it so much he bought one as well and used it for many years on his solo albums.
When Geoff Downes produced the Steve Howe/Steve Hackett supergroup GTR's album, there was no keyboard player on the album but all the strings, brass and synth parts were triggered on the Synthex via MIDI guitar by ex-Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett. Ex-Yes/Asia guitarist Steve Howe also triggered several lead sounds on the Synthex via MIDI guitar.

Soundion Oy Ltd was founded by Jukka Kulmala in Salo, Finland. The Elka Synthex will be our first product – and one of many to come. We’ll specialise in synthesisers, electronic keyboard instruments and sound equipment.

Jukka Kulmala



Jukka Kulmala is the CEO of Soundion Oy and a long-time musical instrument professional and electronic music buff. Kulmala has a background in banking and music company management, with extensive knowledge of business finance.
During his extensive career, he has worked at Ensio Music – a record company and music publisher – as the Managing Director, as well as at Fazer Musiikki in Turku as a Managing Director. Kulmala also has extensive experience in finance, where he worked as a Corporate Banking Manager for Nordea between 1983 and 2010. 
Seppo NikkiläSeppo Ilmari Nikkilä, M.Sc.EE, born 1949, graduated from Helsinki University of Technology mastering in Digital Electronics and Computer Science in 1975. In the early 1970s he was pioneering the use of microprocessors in industrial control. In 1980 he lead a group that employed the emerging local area networking technology with microprocessors to design and implement an integrated process and production automation system – still in use worldwide. 
In 1975  Nikkilä co-founded Genelec Oy, a Finnish audio technology company specialising in active monitor loudspeakers. Since 1988 he has worked as the CEO for ANT – Advanced Network Technologies Oy, and since 2003 especially with the wireless distribution and collection of real-time, streaming multichannel high definition audio. Nikkilä is AES member number 83990 and the author of nearly one hundred scientific or technical papers and reports.
Paul Wiffen


Paul Wiffen, Product Specialist and Sound Designer, M.A. (Hons) OXON, has had an extensive career in sound design, music production, composition and electronic music. Wiffen is the original sound designer of the Elka Synthex – and his sounds will be heard on the reissued Synthex as well.
Wiffen has worked extensively with the likes of Jean-Michel Jarre, Stevie Wonder, Geoff Downes, Keith Emerson and Paul McCartney. His sounds were used by Emu, Ensoniq, Sequential, Akai, Roland and Yamaha – but he always had the Synthex in the boot of his car as samplers by themselves could often not deliver the power and depth of sounds on which his reputation was based. 
Wiffen went on to found Digital Village, the number one retailer in the UK of digital audio on computers that was recently sold to the German retail giant Music Store, and has worked with Apple as a music and audio evangelist. Wiffen’s more recent work has been in film: he won the 24hr film challenge in Cannes in 2006 and his docudramas have won three international awards on Mexico, Ireland and Long Island in the US.

1. Why is this marked as flexible funding? Will you refund my money if you don't reach your target?
The campaign is being run like a fixed funding campaign, and the page got mistakenly marked as ""flexible funding"" during the setup. Unfortunately changing the page at this stage isn't technically possible, but we will refund your contribution 100% should we not meet our goal.
To find out more about fixed funding and refunds, read more here.  We understand that you're considering contributing a lot of money to this project, and want you to know exactly what you're agreeing to. If you have any other questions or concerns about this, don't hesitate to drop us a line at lets@bringelkaback.com.
2. Why are you bringing Elka back? Why not create something new?


The Elka Synthex has long been loved and missed by both musicians and enthusiasts alike. Originally produced between 1981 and 1984, its iconic eightnote polyphony sound defined a generation of music across genres, from the pure electronica of Jean–Michel Jarre, through the stadium rock of Asia and Duran Duran, to the urban funk of Stevie Wonder. In reissuing this coveted instrument, Soundion wants to provide Elka Synthex aficionados around the world with a new opportunity to own one of these timeless classics at a fair price. 


This is the world’s first crowd­funding campaign to reissue a vintage instrument no longer in production.

3. How will the new Elka Synthex be manufactured?
We are ramping up a world-class production environment in Salo, Finland. This will provide all reissued Elka Synthexes with the highest possible build quality. Soundion Oy acquired all the intellectual property and assets of Generalmusic – including Elka. Along with the acquisition of the company came warehouses full of original vintage components that will be used in building the reissued Synthexes. These will be combined with newly manufactured components as required and assembled manually to give a current Elka Synthex the sound of the original.



4. Will the technical specs of the reissued ELKA Synthex differ from the original?
Stock of the original CEM3320 filter chips are available. However, before making the final decision to use any vintage parts, we must verify the parts can last another 30 years. The same logic applies for other components as well. We're working on this now and will provide updates on specific components as we go.








5. How can I follow the remake of the ELKA Synthex?

There’s a lot happening and you can follow the development of your ELKA Synthex as the story unfolds. Stay up to date on this page, and we definitely recommend following us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for the latest news and bits from the Soundion HQ.

6. In what countries will the ELKA Synthex be available? 
Worldwide, pretty much! If you've got concerns about shipping to your country of residence, get in touch with us.


7. Are shipping costs included in the Perk price in Indiegogo?

Shipping costs are not included in the pre-order perk price, and will be charged later before we ship your Elka Synthex to you. We will inform you with delivery options closer to the delivery date. We'll do our very best to make sure you get the Elka Synthex delivered flexibly and at a good price.
8. Does the Perk price include VAT or other taxes?

The perk price does not include taxes and duties payable in your country of residence, and they will need to be paid by the contributor separately. Once we get closer to the delivery date, we'll ask you to confirm your shipping address.


If you live in the EU, we will also provide instructions on how to do the VAT payments.


Outside the EU, you will have to handle the customs and taxes on your own.

9. When are you going to ship me my ELKA Synthex?


We aim to ship the first ELKA Synthex synthesisers in December 2015. Please note that the delivery date is subject to change. We will keep you updated on the schedule in our update emails.


10. If I am not happy with my new ELKA Synthex, can I return it and get my money back?


Yes, you may return the ELKA Synthex delivered to you within 14 days of receiving it. Please note that the refund return shipping, including any customs or other charges – as applicable – will be borne by the sender.

11. After the Indiegogo campaign, where will the ELKA Synthex be available? 


We are currently working on the distributor network. At the moment we do not have any plans to share, but once everything is set we'll let you know.

<h3>Our story</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Eduardo Martins, I'm Portuguese, born in Angola 52 years ago, I live near Lisbon, in the city of Montijo, on the left bank of the Tagus River. I'm married, father of three daughters and grandfather of two grandchildren. Professionally I work in graphic design and photography but my interests are vast, ranging from drawing to comics and sculpture and literature to history. MK I Field Watch started as a design project about three years ago. Soon it proved to be a real challenge and the more I deepened my knowledge of the history of watchmaking, the more serious it became. After dozens of drawings and the exploration of some concepts - and after several watches bought and dissected - I realized that military watches were the ones that fascinated me the most, both for their heritage and their simplicity. That was when the idea of creating a watch brand dedicated to resistant and utilitarian watches was born, as I no longer wanted to design a watch but a series of them! Thus CONTAR was born.</p>
<p>The Portuguese word ""contar"" has several meanings, it means both <i>calculating</i> and <i>narrating</i>, as it is also used to say about something or someone that is reliable. As, in some way, we want to tell stories but also reflect the very history of military watchmaking with the watches we are going to produce, as we agree there is a long record of field and military watches and our models will always reflect this heritage, as it isn't only aesthetics but rather based on the strength of simplicity and effectiveness. Contar seemed appropriate and was approved by the most demanding assembly of all: my family.</p>
<p>In the future we want to create a collection of watches in some way linked to military events, we want to tell stories and produce watches that establish a link to the past. We have several ideas and projects under development, maybe the Great War, where we Portuguese also played a role, but we also love marine watches. Let's see what the future holds.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Creating a brand is not as simple as it may seem, it is arduous because it takes us away from the creative process and requires a lot of dedication - here I must emphasize the support of those who are closest to me, they have been decisive in this journey - which at times is very lonely - also motivating greater responsibility and commitment. I believe that for any independent brand financing is a fundamental issue. A new brand without any background in the business makes the challenge greater. This is where Indiegogo and its contributors come in. We invested in the legalization of CONTAR, in the development of the first model, in the search for the right manufacturer, in molds and prototypes, the packaging, our website, in promotional materials on social networks, and in many other things. But the biggest slice concerns the manufacture of the watch. At this moment when we launch this campaign everything is finished and the manufacturer is waiting the order to start mass production.</p>
<p>The value we want to achieve is intended to make the production of the MKI feasible and make it reach our backers within the promised time. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support will also allow us to continue the development of the next watch and continue to build a true collection of quartz and mechanical watches.</p>
<p>MK I is, therefore, our scout, we send him forward, he will tell us what lies ahead on the road.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Watch Specifications:</h3>
<p>Case Material: 316L Stainless Steel<br/>Brushed Finish<br/>Case Size: 40mm <br/>47mm lug to lug<br/>Case Thickness: 10,5 mm (including crystal)<br/>Lug Width: 20mm<br/>Dial: black with applied markers and printed arabic numerals<br/>Movement: VD78 Japan Movement<br/>Water Resistance: 10 ATM (100M)<br/>Lume: BGW9<br/>Crown: 7mm Screw down, engraved with CONTAR logo<br/>Case Back: 4 Screws with recessed area for strap accommodation<br/>Crystal: Double domed sapphire <br/>Anti-reflective inside coated<br/>Straps: Olive green nylon double pass with signed buckle.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Some notes</h3>
<p>The CONTAR field is mainly inspired by British military watches from World War II and other more recent ones like the MK XI with a dial design of the RAF's own responsibility. In our model we merged some of these designs and made sure to use a layout with small seconds, which limited our movement options a little. The VD78, in addition to being from a reliable manufacturer, was the one with the longest pinion distance and we wanted the second sub dial to be as large as possible, without sacrificing 5 and 7 arabic numerals. The 24-hour military scale was in doubt but still useful and accentuates the military character of the watch.</p>
<p>The case was supposed to have drilled lugs but this would reduce the distance between the springbars and the case which would make it difficult to place thicker straps. This is a watch designed to be used with ""Nato"" or ""Zulu"" straps that expose the springbars, facilitating their removal and placement.</p>
<p>We did not want to use patina, this is a new watch that will age naturally, so we opted for the BGW9 Lume which maintains a white appearance. By opting for applied markers, we believe we can facilitate relume in the future.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Unlike the first prototype, the applied stainless steel markers will have a matte finish, similar to the hands.  And the triangular marker at 12 o'clock will also be applied.</p>

</div></div>","Our story
Hello, my name is Eduardo Martins, I'm Portuguese, born in Angola 52 years ago, I live near Lisbon, in the city of Montijo, on the left bank of the Tagus River. I'm married, father of three daughters and grandfather of two grandchildren. Professionally I work in graphic design and photography but my interests are vast, ranging from drawing to comics and sculpture and literature to history. MK I Field Watch started as a design project about three years ago. Soon it proved to be a real challenge and the more I deepened my knowledge of the history of watchmaking, the more serious it became. After dozens of drawings and the exploration of some concepts - and after several watches bought and dissected - I realized that military watches were the ones that fascinated me the most, both for their heritage and their simplicity. That was when the idea of creating a watch brand dedicated to resistant and utilitarian watches was born, as I no longer wanted to design a watch but a series of them! Thus CONTAR was born.
The Portuguese word ""contar"" has several meanings, it means both calculating and narrating, as it is also used to say about something or someone that is reliable. As, in some way, we want to tell stories but also reflect the very history of military watchmaking with the watches we are going to produce, as we agree there is a long record of field and military watches and our models will always reflect this heritage, as it isn't only aesthetics but rather based on the strength of simplicity and effectiveness. Contar seemed appropriate and was approved by the most demanding assembly of all: my family.
In the future we want to create a collection of watches in some way linked to military events, we want to tell stories and produce watches that establish a link to the past. We have several ideas and projects under development, maybe the Great War, where we Portuguese also played a role, but we also love marine watches. Let's see what the future holds.


As we agree there is a long record of field and military watches and our models will always reflect this heritage, as it isn't only aesthetics but rather based on the strength of simplicity and effectiveness​.
Eduardo Martins
 
What We Need & What You Get
Creating a brand is not as simple as it may seem, it is arduous because it takes us away from the creative process and requires a lot of dedication - here I must emphasize the support of those who are closest to me, they have been decisive in this journey - which at times is very lonely - also motivating greater responsibility and commitment. I believe that for any independent brand financing is a fundamental issue. A new brand without any background in the business makes the challenge greater. This is where Indiegogo and its contributors come in. We invested in the legalization of CONTAR, in the development of the first model, in the search for the right manufacturer, in molds and prototypes, the packaging, our website, in promotional materials on social networks, and in many other things. But the biggest slice concerns the manufacture of the watch. At this moment when we launch this campaign everything is finished and the manufacturer is waiting the order to start mass production.
The value we want to achieve is intended to make the production of the MKI feasible and make it reach our backers within the promised time. 


 
The Impact
Your support will also allow us to continue the development of the next watch and continue to build a true collection of quartz and mechanical watches.
MK I is, therefore, our scout, we send him forward, he will tell us what lies ahead on the road.
 
Watch Specifications:
Case Material: 316L Stainless SteelBrushed FinishCase Size: 40mm 47mm lug to lugCase Thickness: 10,5 mm (including crystal)Lug Width: 20mmDial: black with applied markers and printed arabic numeralsMovement: VD78 Japan MovementWater Resistance: 10 ATM (100M)Lume: BGW9Crown: 7mm Screw down, engraved with CONTAR logoCase Back: 4 Screws with recessed area for strap accommodationCrystal: Double domed sapphire Anti-reflective inside coatedStraps: Olive green nylon double pass with signed buckle.
 
Some notes
The CONTAR field is mainly inspired by British military watches from World War II and other more recent ones like the MK XI with a dial design of the RAF's own responsibility. In our model we merged some of these designs and made sure to use a layout with small seconds, which limited our movement options a little. The VD78, in addition to being from a reliable manufacturer, was the one with the longest pinion distance and we wanted the second sub dial to be as large as possible, without sacrificing 5 and 7 arabic numerals. The 24-hour military scale was in doubt but still useful and accentuates the military character of the watch.
The case was supposed to have drilled lugs but this would reduce the distance between the springbars and the case which would make it difficult to place thicker straps. This is a watch designed to be used with ""Nato"" or ""Zulu"" straps that expose the springbars, facilitating their removal and placement.
We did not want to use patina, this is a new watch that will age naturally, so we opted for the BGW9 Lume which maintains a white appearance. By opting for applied markers, we believe we can facilitate relume in the future.

Unlike the first prototype, the applied stainless steel markers will have a matte finish, similar to the hands.  And the triangular marker at 12 o'clock will also be applied.
 

The applied markers are useful to help reading time in certain light conditions. The matte finish makes it easier to read but without shiny sparkles.

Caseback recessed area for strap accommodation. The watch fits more comfortably on the wrist.
 

VD78  is a reliable Japanese quartz movement. The accuracy of the movement is 20 seconds a month, with about 3 years of battery life (SR626SW).
 


Screw down crown. Aid to water resistance (10 ATM) of the watch and protects the crown.

<p>Megalodon Sports is introducing you to a revolutionary new way to represent your team on the field. We will emblazon your team's logo, name, or slogan on one of our mouthguards. </p>

<p>We also know that teams are made up of individuals.  For those who wish to showcase a bit of their personality (with your coach's permission of course), we can add any graphic you'd like to the lip guard.  Want to say ""Hi Mom"" every time you score?  Done.  Or maybe you just want your name and number printed on the lip guard?  Done.  Whatever you'd like to promote your team or any unique design you'd like to showcase this season, let us transform a boring piece of protective equipment into your own branded billboard.</p>

<p>We went through an exhaustive 6 month long design cycle to ensure we put together a great product.  We used 3D CAD to make model after model and vetted each variant using 3D Printing and Rapid Prototyping.  Finally, after 6 previous iterations, the mouthguard is production ready. The production mouthguards will sport the following features.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Material:</strong> Made by injection molding with FDA-approved Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA). </li>
<li>
<strong>Protection:</strong>The lip guard adds an extra layer of strength outside of the players mouth that helps prevent damage to the lips and teeth as well as keeps dirt and grime from entering mouth.   </li>
<li>
<strong>Personalization</strong>: Logos will be added with a patent pending process that will seal the logos with a protective layer of transparent plastic so they won't rub off during the grind of practices and games.</li>
<li>
<strong>Optional Lanyard</strong>: We will include the option of adding a lanyard to the mouthguard.  This will allow players to securely fasten the guard to their facemasks.</li>

<p>Airgetlám
Industries is a prosthetics company built for prosthetics users by prosthetics
users. The president, Solomon Stone Romney, is the first client; he was born
without fingers on his left hand. Advocacy is at the core of everything the
company does. Airgetlám Industries’ designs focus on the user, their needs and
feelings, rather than on the technology or the way society views them. Every
effort is made to anticipate the needs of the client and to adapt rapidly to
them. The decision to use a prosthetic, either to replace something lost or to
augment something that was never had, is a difficult one; a decision this
company is intimately familiar with. Airgetlám Industries seeks to make that
process as comforting as possible through simple pricing and purchasing (direct
to the client), individual attention, and support throughout the life of their
device.</p>
<p>Through a combination of historical inspiration and modern innovation,
Airgetlám Industries seeks to provide a prosthetics unlike any other currently
on the market. Using a system of ratchets, springs, and cables, capacitive
materials, and cutting edge manufacturing techniques, Airgetlám Industries will
provide a hand with full articulation, fully functional use of a touch screen,
and almost zero maintenance at a price comparable to the most basic hook
systems available. For years prosthetics users have been asking for, and not
receiving, these features.</p>
<p></p><p><u>What does Airgetlám mean?</u></p><p>Pronounced just as it's spelled (the emphasis on the last syllable). In Irish mythology, Nuada was the first king of the Tuatha De Danann so chosen for his physical perfection. During the conquest of the Firbolgs, another mythic Irish race, Nuada lost his arm during the Battle of Moytirra; being now imperfect, he was forced to abdicate his throne. The great Danann healer Dian Cecht and the smith Creidhne were able to craft Nuada an arm of silver to replace his missing limb. This silver limb was so lifelike that it both allowed Nuada to reclaim his throne and earned him the moniker “Airgetlám,” which means “silver hand.” Airgetlám Industries seeks to recreate the marvel of Dian Cecht and Creidhne by bringing people closer to perfection through the use of artificial, metal limbs.</p><p><u style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What is the project?</u></p>

Airgetlám
Industries is a prosthetics company built for prosthetics users by prosthetics
users. The president, Solomon Stone Romney, is the first client; he was born
without fingers on his left hand. Advocacy is at the core of everything the
company does. Airgetlám Industries’ designs focus on the user, their needs and
feelings, rather than on the technology or the way society views them. Every
effort is made to anticipate the needs of the client and to adapt rapidly to
them. The decision to use a prosthetic, either to replace something lost or to
augment something that was never had, is a difficult one; a decision this
company is intimately familiar with. Airgetlám Industries seeks to make that
process as comforting as possible through simple pricing and purchasing (direct
to the client), individual attention, and support throughout the life of their
device.
Through a combination of historical inspiration and modern innovation,
Airgetlám Industries seeks to provide a prosthetics unlike any other currently
on the market. Using a system of ratchets, springs, and cables, capacitive
materials, and cutting edge manufacturing techniques, Airgetlám Industries will
provide a hand with full articulation, fully functional use of a touch screen,
and almost zero maintenance at a price comparable to the most basic hook
systems available. For years prosthetics users have been asking for, and not
receiving, these features.
What does Airgetlám mean?Pronounced just as it's spelled (the emphasis on the last syllable). In Irish mythology, Nuada was the first king of the Tuatha De Danann so chosen for his physical perfection. During the conquest of the Firbolgs, another mythic Irish race, Nuada lost his arm during the Battle of Moytirra; being now imperfect, he was forced to abdicate his throne. The great Danann healer Dian Cecht and the smith Creidhne were able to craft Nuada an arm of silver to replace his missing limb. This silver limb was so lifelike that it both allowed Nuada to reclaim his throne and earned him the moniker “Airgetlám,” which means “silver hand.” Airgetlám Industries seeks to recreate the marvel of Dian Cecht and Creidhne by bringing people closer to perfection through the use of artificial, metal limbs.What is the project?

<p>Secret Shimapan is the very first brand of underwear that changes 
colors when you put them on! We use a unique  thermosensitive ink that reacts to your body heat, turning transparent at 31°C/88°F, creating a beautiful shimapan pattern. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433541639/zkilw4xsbwmgckx86v9m.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>These cute bikini-cut cotton panties not only come in gorgerous
 blue, pink, green or black models, but with enough funding, will also 
come in sizes that fit even the curviest of women, transgender ladies, 
and guys who just want to wear cute underwear.</span></p>
<p></p> <p> </p><h3>Why do we need $7,500? </h3><ul>
<li>In order to comply with quality standards, we need to buy a  whooping 10 kilograms of specially made ink. This alone will cost us $1,000.</li>
<li>To pay everyone who is working on this project for the following months, we will need $700 more.</li>
<li>To obtain quality panties at a low enough price to make a profit, we'll have to buy them in bulk, which will cost us about $1,100.</li>
<li>Finally there's the costs to buy a domain, build an webpage, set up an entire online shop infrastructure to take orders after the campaign ends, and legally register the brand and logo. Oh, right, and paying taxes. All this amounts to a total of $734.14</li>
</ul><p>These donations alone will help us keep the online shop 
work for an entire year!</p>
<h3>Wait, that doesn't amount to $8,500, so what gives?</h3>

Secret Shimapan, and sending them to you!</p>
<h3>Sounds great! But how do i choose<b> my sizes, colours, and styles?</b>
</h3><p>Don't worry, you'll be able to choose the sizes, colors and styles of
 your Secret Shimapan after the campaign succeeds, via a link with a form to

<h2><strong>The Sonicherries Story </strong></h2>
<p>Nowadays people are affected by excessive noise more than ever. The number of people with hearing loss is rising dramatically.

<p>Our product is only a means through which we wish to bring an important announcement - <strong>protect your ears and enjoy the beauty of sound.</strong></p>
<p>Our first goal is <strong>to extend hearing ability</strong> to as many people as possible. We would like <strong>to let people hear their music at the sound level at which it can be enjoyed</strong>.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The SLAP CASE team is made up of 5 college students currently attending the University at Albany- SUNY.  Our team members are Vasyl Antoshchuk, Heather Forster, Matt Legere, Nicole Phillips, and Roxanne Pitt. The SLAP CASE team met in an entrepreneurship class, coming together to create a product we felt we needed and others would too. </p>
<p>SLAP CASE is a sleeker case for both sunglasses and eyeglasses that allows optimal protection without the discomfort of having a huge glasses case in your pocket, or risking possible damage to your glasses. SLAP CASE is a foldable case that could fit in a wallet or pocket when glasses are in use and can then be used to protect glasses when not in use.</p>
<p>So far, our contributors have helped us turn our concept of the SLAP CASE into a more functional stage as we begin to take on the prototyping stage! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to start our project off fully, we need $5,000 to prove that there is enough interest for our product and allow us to purchase the necessary materials to help start our SLAP CASE brand. In order to help us raise this money, we are offering 6 levels of incentives for those who donate with prizes such as t-shirts, glasses cleaners, thank you's,  the actual SLAP CASE itself, and more! If we don't reach our goal, these funds will come back to you and we will recharge and better our SLAP CASE design to further help our target market. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>A world without any scratch marks. </i></p>
<p>As college students, we are beginning our transition into the ""real world"" and SLAP CASE is the beginning of that journey. We intend to make life easier for glasses wearers by lessening the space needed for a glasses case and still allowing protection to the glasses.</p>
<p>The SLAP CASE team has been hard at work researching the problems glasses owners face most often in order to improve our product and make life easier. Some things we’ve come across are that 61% of Americans wear eyeglasses, and even more wear sunglasses! By 2020 this market is expected to be a 300 billion dollar industry and we want to make sure you’re getting the most for your money, that’s why our glasses case helps you clean and protect your glasses anywhere without the hassle of a big, bulky case.</p>
<p>Did you know that wear and tear is the #2 reason people purchase new glasses? Well, that’s probably because no one wants to carry a huge case around all the time and there’s currently no case on the market that is as thin and as protective as the SLAP CASE. Stop spending your money on new glasses to replace a scratched up pair, buy a SLAP CASE and spend your money seeing a clearer world for longer! We’re still perfecting our cases and adding new designs to fit your personality, so if you have any suggestions feel free to leave a comment below.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you've broken/scratched your glasses too many times and therefore don't have the money to help our vision we ask that you <i>SLAP</i> some sense into your friends and spread the word using some of the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

<h2>The Story Behind Our Brand</h2>
<p>Whats the story behind ""CHRIS TOMSON""?</p>
<p>Our team sought out to create CHRIS TOMSON because of our passion for high quality watches &amp; accessory and desire to cut out the brand inflation and retail markup of popular name brands.  We got frustrated paying hundreds of euros for name brand products, knowing they only cost a fraction of the price to make.  So we have spent the past year working with leaders in the industry to come up with an affordable, stylish looking and high quality watch &amp; accessory collection.</p>
<p><strong>When designing our products, we made sure of THREE things:</strong></p>
<p>- the highest quality materials<br/>- a look thats reflects the lifestyle of the city that the series represent <br/>- offering highest quality products at a price less than 50% of what our competitor's cost</p>
<p><strong>After 1 year and hundreds of hours of passionate work we are proud to present our first series - ""The NYC""-Series. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Now we need YOUR support to implement the first mass order and bring our brand &amp; vision to life.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Products:</h3>

</div><div>
<h3>Watch-Series ""NYC""</h3>
<p>We want our watches to reflect the lifestyle of very special places. </p>
<p>Which is why we chose New York City as our first design in the series.  A classic watch that reflects the minimalist urban lifestyle of the city. A watch strap made of the finest Italian leather, combined with a scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. </p>
<p>Quality, elegance and durability down to the last detail.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538848855/uyggazag8kbfur5meq5y.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>Inspired by the zeitgeist of New York City, the ""Classic NYC"" series unites harmonious aesthetics with classic design. The timepieces, which shine with timeless elegance, enjoy the reputation of an instant classic. </p>

<div> </div>
</div>
<p>Inspiration alone was not enough for us. We wanted to create a certain connection between our watches and the places they represent.  </p>
<p>For this reason, we engraved the silhouettes of each city into our watches, with loving precision and attention to detail. </p>
<p>This embossing brings our watches to life with a character as unique as the city.  </p>

<p>We are beginners in crowdfunding, but we and our manufacturing partners have years of experience in the industry!</p>
<p>We are aware our project is complex and that there are always unforeseen issues, but we have anticipated and planned for potential risks and have built a rock-solid production and delivery plan.</p>
<p>Firstly, our production is quite advanced and you can be very confident about our capacity to provide high-quality products on time. We spent over 1 year designing, developing, and receiving finalized samples.</p>

</div></div>","The Story Behind Our Brand
Whats the story behind ""CHRIS TOMSON""?
Our team sought out to create CHRIS TOMSON because of our passion for high quality watches & accessory and desire to cut out the brand inflation and retail markup of popular name brands.  We got frustrated paying hundreds of euros for name brand products, knowing they only cost a fraction of the price to make.  So we have spent the past year working with leaders in the industry to come up with an affordable, stylish looking and high quality watch & accessory collection.
When designing our products, we made sure of THREE things:
- the highest quality materials- a look thats reflects the lifestyle of the city that the series represent - offering highest quality products at a price less than 50% of what our competitor's cost
After 1 year and hundreds of hours of passionate work we are proud to present our first series - ""The NYC""-Series. 
Now we need YOUR support to implement the first mass order and bring our brand & vision to life.
 
The Products:


Watch-Series ""NYC""
We want our watches to reflect the lifestyle of very special places. 
Which is why we chose New York City as our first design in the series.  A classic watch that reflects the minimalist urban lifestyle of the city. A watch strap made of the finest Italian leather, combined with a scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. 
Quality, elegance and durability down to the last detail.

Inspired by the zeitgeist of New York City, the ""Classic NYC"" series unites harmonious aesthetics with classic design. The timepieces, which shine with timeless elegance, enjoy the reputation of an instant classic. 


 

Our first, the classic line, is an ideal companion whether for him or her, be it in business meetings or in everyday life. Change the look in just a few steps, by changing the band to perfectly match any outfit.


 

Inspiration alone was not enough for us. We wanted to create a certain connection between our watches and the places they represent.  
For this reason, we engraved the silhouettes of each city into our watches, with loving precision and attention to detail. 
This embossing brings our watches to life with a character as unique as the city.  

 
The Laptop-Sleeve ""Manhattan”
- handmade from the finest leather. 
Minimalist design, combined with the highest quality leather create a piece that harmonizes with any style. Paired with a suit or casual attire, the Manhattan Laptop Sleeve will certainly attract attention in every setting.

 
The thickness of the leather has been perfectly tuned to provide optimal protection for your device in every situation. An additional compartment at the front offers you a perfect storage option, so that even small things like your mobile phone can be transported in style.
 

 
Through the combination of a harmonious & sophisticated design in combination with high-quality leather, our “MANHATTAN"" is the perfect companion for every business meeting.
 

 
Weekender-Bag ""Discoverer""
A lavishly designed leather bag that deserves its seat as the centerpiece of any distinguished travel wardrobe. Handcrafted from the highest quality leather and designed for time away from everyday life.  
 
High-quality leather, the finest workmanship, and a sophisticated design make the functional leather weekender the perfect companion—whether for a short break with friends or a business trip with colleagues.
 


 

The well-thought-out design of the Weekender not only provides plenty of travel essentials, but also has a purposefully designed inner compartment with leather fastenings that keeps your electronic devices safe and secure at all times.    
 
To keep organized even in the stress of the airport, we added a perfectly sized passport pocket to the outside of the weekender to keep your passport at hand. 
 

 
For the modern traveler, we offer the perfect blend of precision craftsmanship and timeless, functional design. The “Discoverer” is certain to garner attention and pairs well with modern ambition.
 

 

 

 
 
 
What We Need & What You Get
After 1 year and hundreds of hours of passionate work we are proud to present our first series - ""The NYC""-Series. 
Now we need YOUR support to implement the first mass order and bring our brand & vision to life.
For your support we give you an discount up to 50% off the future retail price.

<p>A revolutionary new kind of diaper bag that makes traveling with a baby easier. Parents rarely have an extra hand to spare, which is why we designed a backpack that flips to diapering without having to use a zipper! </p>

<p>Our mission is to help busy parents stress less about going outdoors or not having a place to change their little ones. Simply, pull and unlock the cover to a diaper change under 3 seconds (did you notice that it's done with a single hand?). </p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.thevianetic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/trunk-changes.gif"" src=""""/><p>All your items are within easy reach.

INTRODUCING VIANETIC   (vee-uh net'ik). The meaning of the name draws from the usage of magnetic interface from point to point to bring about a super-fast and convenient way of diapering.
OUR STORY

A revolutionary new kind of diaper bag that makes traveling with a baby easier. Parents rarely have an extra hand to spare, which is why we designed a backpack that flips to diapering without having to use a zipper! 
 
Our mission is to help busy parents stress less about going outdoors or not having a place to change their little ones. Simply, pull and unlock the cover to a diaper change under 3 seconds (did you notice that it's done with a single hand?).  All your items are within easy reach. No more wondering what's buried at the bottom of a bag.

 
PROBLEM WITH CAR CHANGES TODAY
 Zipper frustration.
 
 
Top-loading bags stacks items on top of each other — making items difficult to find.

Backpacks are meant to be helpful, not break your back.
 
 
OUR SOLUTION
 

Easy Reach Items
Organized
Diapering in 3-seconds
Easy Setup
Diapering within reach.

All in one compartment. Say goodbye to fishing..
Ease of use, speed to open, simple organization to be the drivers of this bag. By implementing a german-engineered magnetic pull-release lock, the bag is secure and allows for the fastest opening possible, without zippers. Magnetic connections run along both sides of the bag to help secure and keep items from falling out. A single main compartment for quick access of essential items such as wipes, diapers, creams, toys, without ever second guessing which zipper pocket or how deep into a bag I need to go to get to items.
   
SPEED AND EASE OF USE 
  Self standing feet allows for easy changes on any flat surface. Get to diapering in under 3 seconds. How fast is your diaper bag?

<div>Couple of months ago, when we started to work on this project we didn't expect so much support from everyone. This kept us going forward with incredible momentum, even when we faced many challenges regarding the manufacturing of our prototypes. It was an incredibly exciting moment to hold them after we spent so much care and long hours in front of the computer designing them. We want to share the same passion and excitement with everyone who would like to wear their own unique creations.</div>

</div></div>","Optopus sunglasses are designed by You, 3D-printed by us.


What is Optopus?





With Optopus you can create your own sunglasses easily, online.


On our website you can get access to our online designing platform where you can modify multiple parameters of your sunglasses. You don't need to be a designer or engineer because our system is really easy to use.






What can you personalize?
We all know that many online personalization solutions give you really limited possibilities to modify the products. At Optopus we are striving to give you more freedom in customization so you can literally express and wear your creativity. The only limit to your imagination is that the glasses have to be 3D-printable, but these limits are built into our software.






Some cool features which you can personalize on your Optopus sunglasses:









After you have finished your design we deliver your completely unique sunglasses to your door.

The Sunglasses

Our sunglasses are made by 3D printing technology in awesome quality

We are using Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) industrial 3D printing technology for the production of our sunglasses. This technology allows us to materialize even your most extreme creations in a high-quality and cost effective way. If you compare the quality of our products with ordinary high-class sunglasses you won't realize the difference neither with your eyes or your hands.


Our special plastic material (Polyamide 12) makes our sunglasses extremely lightweight and durable, so you can wear them in almost every moment of your life. They also come with UV protected lenses so you don't need to worry about the sunlight.






Some kickass features:
Unbreakable frame and temples
Lightweight yet strong structure
100% full-spectrum UV protected lenses







   Our current status

Couple of months ago, when we started to work on this project we didn't expect so much support from everyone. This kept us going forward with incredible momentum, even when we faced many challenges regarding the manufacturing of our prototypes. It was an incredibly exciting moment to hold them after we spent so much care and long hours in front of the computer designing them. We want to share the same passion and excitement with everyone who would like to wear their own unique creations.





Currently, we are developing the customizer software, which is now under testing and will be publicly released very soon. Of course, development continues ever after, so we need a lot of feedback on how should we enhance our software and improve its functionality.






Why we need you
We've come to Indiegogo because we want to show our project to the world. We need your feedback and support to get our product to the market faster. We would like to equip our designing platform with new functions (more customizable styles, perfect-fit technology) and develop our virtual try-on software and the mobile version of our platform but only your help will get us there. We have gathered the manufacturing know-how for producing our sunglasses in the best quality and we are also negotiating with manufacturing partners, but with your support this process will be much faster. We are sure that together we can make it!

ZHBoston is the new design firm in town. We believe in creating beautiful products that you will use every single day. We strive for simplicity, but we use the most premium, locally-sourced materials. By relying on woods, leathers, and metals, we can ensure that every product - even when mass produced - is unique. <div>
<br/>For each product we design, we partner with a local manufacturer. All our products are made with care by American workers in American factories. Our supply chain is fully transparent. ZHBoston isn't one of those companies that sends our designs over to China - we are among the growing few that seek to revive American craftsmanship and ingenuity. We are so thrilled to have you with us on this journey. <br/>

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>There's a bunch of new Apple Watch charging docks out there. For the most part, they all look the same. They elevate your Watch in midair; they place it on a pedestal. But that's not what your Apple Watch needs - it needs to rest and recharge (pun fully intended). That's how we came up with a better idea. Don't elevate your Apple Watch - cradle it!<br/><br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">WatchCradle takes up a small footprint on your desk, table, or nightstand. When your Watch isn't charging it looks elegant and unobtrusive. Place your Apple Watch around WatchCradle's center post, however, and it is abundantly clear that the two just belong together.<br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>Real, locally sourced wood means each piece is unique. Supple leather from a local tannery cushions your Apple Watch. And each Cradle is hand-finished by an expert woodworker.<br/><br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Everything about WatchCradle exudes minimalistic luxury. It's okay to indulge.</span>

<h3>How it Works</h3>
<div>WatchCradle's design is so simple. First, feed the usb cable through the front hole and then insert the charger. The charger will either be held in with magnets, a residue-free adhesive pad, or a simple press fit (we are in the process of testing each method). Then, run the cable through the slot in the rear, and coil any slack inside the base. Finally, cover the base with the rubber bottom. It's that easy! To charge your Apple Watch, just place it on the WatchCradle as shown.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<h4>Prototypes</h4>
<p>The below photos show our first round prototypes. The final version will have a slightly larger base with a wood rim surrounding the leather, just like in our rendered images throughout this page. <b>The final version will also be much much glossier!</b></p>

<h3>The Project Plan</h3>
<div>We've already completed the first round of prototypes - these are pictured throughout this page! Below is our plan for the rest of the project:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<b>April 30: </b>Indiegogo project launches!</li>
<li>
<b>June 1:</b> Indiegogo project successfully ends.</li>
<li>
<b>Late May/Early June:</b> Further prototyping, prep for manufacturing.</li>
<li>
<b>June:</b> Manufacture and ship the first batches of WatchCradles, starting in mid-June and probably extending until mid-July (depending on how many backers we have!).</li>
<li>
<b>July:</b> Finish shipping all units and set up online store.</li>
</ul></div>
<h4>Fund us early! </h4>
<div>The sooner we pass our goal, the sooner we will start preparing advanced prototypes and purchasing tooling for manufacturing. Also, we will ship out WatchCradles in the order in which contributions are received, so be sure to back us right away! You might just get yours in mid-June.</div>
<h4>Risks</h4>
<div>There are risks involved with funding any Indiegogo project, but we are confident we've done our best to minimize these risks. We've already made prototypes, lined up a manufacturer, and received a commitment that the manufacturer can produce a large number of WatchCradles. Moreover, our manufacturer has been involved in every step of the design process, so we anticipate no issues with manufacturing.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Perks</span></h3>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We offer a few perks - purchase a microfiber cloth with our logo, purchase one WatchCradle (early bird in limited quantities), purchase two WatchCradles, or - if you are feeling generous - purchase 10 WatchCradles! We wanted to keep these perks simple, but if you are looking for an option that is not available, let us know! We are happy to add other perks if there is demand. </span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>Please note that you will be able to select wood type, leather color, and cradle size after the funding period ends.</span>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Why is a wood cradle a better idea?</b><br/>Great question! Think about it this way - why would you want to use a large chunk of metal or wood, around 5-6 inches tall, just to charge your small Apple Watch? Why would you want to let its band dangle in mid-air? Why would you want to rely on some sort of adhesive pad to stop the top-heavy pedestal from falling over every time you brush up against it? That's the approach most of our competition has already taken, and we just can't accept it. Moreover, wood cannot scratch metal, no matter how hard you try! We dare you to try  to place your fancy Apple Watch on a metal charging stand without scratching it.</span></li>
<li>
<b>Why would I want to charge my Apple Watch on its side?</b><br/>We've tested the Apple Watch since launch day, and we've learned something that our competition has not - you're not going to want to use your Apple Watch while it's charging. Your Watch is meant to be worn, and there isn't much you can do with it when it's not on your wrist. We suggest placing your WatchCradle on your nightstand, and charging your Watch while you sleep.</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>How do I know my Apple Watch will fit in WatchCradle?</b><br/>We already possess a 42mm Apple Watch Sport, which includes both small and large band sizes. The photos and renderings throughout this project are with this Watch. Once we pass our goal, we will order the 38mm Watch as well as a bunch of other bands from Apple, and will ensure that our final prototypes will work all bands. This may mean making the WatchCradle in two different sizes. The main challenge is bands that are not adjustable on the fly (i.e. Modern Buckle and Link Bracelet). We may add a leather strip around the center post in order to accommodate these bands. </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>What colors of leather will you offer?</b><br/>We plan on offering a range of colors. We are 100% certain we will offer black and brown, and we are experimenting with other colors, like white and navy. As a backer, you'll be able to vote for the colors we'll offer, and then select the color of your choice after the funding period ends.

ZHBoston is the new design firm in town. We believe in creating beautiful products that you will use every single day. We strive for simplicity, but we use the most premium, locally-sourced materials. By relying on woods, leathers, and metals, we can ensure that every product - even when mass produced - is unique. 
For each product we design, we partner with a local manufacturer. All our products are made with care by American workers in American factories. Our supply chain is fully transparent. ZHBoston isn't one of those companies that sends our designs over to China - we are among the growing few that seek to revive American craftsmanship and ingenuity. We are so thrilled to have you with us on this journey. 
Meet WatchCradle

There's a bunch of new Apple Watch charging docks out there. For the most part, they all look the same. They elevate your Watch in midair; they place it on a pedestal. But that's not what your Apple Watch needs - it needs to rest and recharge (pun fully intended). That's how we came up with a better idea. Don't elevate your Apple Watch - cradle it!WatchCradle takes up a small footprint on your desk, table, or nightstand. When your Watch isn't charging it looks elegant and unobtrusive. Place your Apple Watch around WatchCradle's center post, however, and it is abundantly clear that the two just belong together.Real, locally sourced wood means each piece is unique. Supple leather from a local tannery cushions your Apple Watch. And each Cradle is hand-finished by an expert woodworker.Everything about WatchCradle exudes minimalistic luxury. It's okay to indulge.


WatchCradle will come in different wood types. You will be able to vote on your favorites and select after the campaign ends!

We love pebbled leather.





How it Works
WatchCradle's design is so simple. First, feed the usb cable through the front hole and then insert the charger. The charger will either be held in with magnets, a residue-free adhesive pad, or a simple press fit (we are in the process of testing each method). Then, run the cable through the slot in the rear, and coil any slack inside the base. Finally, cover the base with the rubber bottom. It's that easy! To charge your Apple Watch, just place it on the WatchCradle as shown.


Prototypes
The below photos show our first round prototypes. The final version will have a slightly larger base with a wood rim surrounding the leather, just like in our rendered images throughout this page. The final version will also be much much glossier!











Lots of prototypes with a lovely Boston view!

Meet Our Manufacturer: Clean Air Woodworks



For this project we are working with Matt from Clean Air Woodworks, a small design-build-manufacturing firm located in the Hudson Valley of New York. CAW focuses on modern designs, zero-VOC (volatile organic compounds) finishes, reclaimed and sustainable wood, and wooden creations of all types. Matt has been a huge help with every aspect of this project. CAW makes everything from tables to cutting boards!







We find our manufacturers on Maker's Row.                                        
Maker's Row is a unique platform connecting American manufacturers with product-based businesses, making factory sourcing surprisingly easy and enjoyable.

About ZHBoston
Zach Herbert started ZHBoston in 2015 as CEO, with the WatchCradle as its first product. Zach studied mechanical engineering at Boston University and will attend Harvard Business School next year. He has previously both designed products and worked with local and foreign manufacturers. Zach looks forward to shipping out many many WatchCradles and growing the ZHBoston team!




The Project Plan
We've already completed the first round of prototypes - these are pictured throughout this page! Below is our plan for the rest of the project:


April 30: Indiegogo project launches!

June 1: Indiegogo project successfully ends.

Late May/Early June: Further prototyping, prep for manufacturing.

June: Manufacture and ship the first batches of WatchCradles, starting in mid-June and probably extending until mid-July (depending on how many backers we have!).

July: Finish shipping all units and set up online store.

Fund us early! 
The sooner we pass our goal, the sooner we will start preparing advanced prototypes and purchasing tooling for manufacturing. Also, we will ship out WatchCradles in the order in which contributions are received, so be sure to back us right away! You might just get yours in mid-June.
Risks
There are risks involved with funding any Indiegogo project, but we are confident we've done our best to minimize these risks. We've already made prototypes, lined up a manufacturer, and received a commitment that the manufacturer can produce a large number of WatchCradles. Moreover, our manufacturer has been involved in every step of the design process, so we anticipate no issues with manufacturing.


The Perks

We offer a few perks - purchase a microfiber cloth with our logo, purchase one WatchCradle (early bird in limited quantities), purchase two WatchCradles, or - if you are feeling generous - purchase 10 WatchCradles! We wanted to keep these perks simple, but if you are looking for an option that is not available, let us know! We are happy to add other perks if there is demand. 


Please note that you will be able to select wood type, leather color, and cradle size after the funding period ends.



FAQs


Why is a wood cradle a better idea?Great question! Think about it this way - why would you want to use a large chunk of metal or wood, around 5-6 inches tall, just to charge your small Apple Watch? Why would you want to let its band dangle in mid-air? Why would you want to rely on some sort of adhesive pad to stop the top-heavy pedestal from falling over every time you brush up against it? That's the approach most of our competition has already taken, and we just can't accept it. Moreover, wood cannot scratch metal, no matter how hard you try! We dare you to try  to place your fancy Apple Watch on a metal charging stand without scratching it.

Why would I want to charge my Apple Watch on its side?We've tested the Apple Watch since launch day, and we've learned something that our competition has not - you're not going to want to use your Apple Watch while it's charging. Your Watch is meant to be worn, and there isn't much you can do with it when it's not on your wrist. We suggest placing your WatchCradle on your nightstand, and charging your Watch while you sleep.
How do I know my Apple Watch will fit in WatchCradle?We already possess a 42mm Apple Watch Sport, which includes both small and large band sizes. The photos and renderings throughout this project are with this Watch. Once we pass our goal, we will order the 38mm Watch as well as a bunch of other bands from Apple, and will ensure that our final prototypes will work all bands. This may mean making the WatchCradle in two different sizes. The main challenge is bands that are not adjustable on the fly (i.e. Modern Buckle and Link Bracelet). We may add a leather strip around the center post in order to accommodate these bands. 
What colors of leather will you offer?We plan on offering a range of colors. We are 100% certain we will offer black and brown, and we are experimenting with other colors, like white and navy. As a backer, you'll be able to vote for the colors we'll offer, and then select the color of your choice after the funding period ends. Leather will come from Pergamena Leather in Montgomery, NY.
What types of wood will you offer?We created most of the prototypes from NY Black Walnut. This wood comes from upstate NY. We are still deciding what other options to offer - let us know if you have requests! It is very easy for us to use other wood types. In the future, we may also offer special editions. 
Will I really receive my WatchCradle in July?That's what we are planning! If we reach our goal in the first week or two, we will immediately get started on advanced prototypes and planning for manufacturing. The earlier we meet our goal, the earlier we ship! The first batches may go out as early as mid-June. Also, we will ship WatchCradles out in the order in which contributions are received, so be sure to back us right away!
How did you manage to obtain a real Apple Watch on the 24th?Zach stayed up past 3am to preorder. It was well worth it. He will always go to great lengths to ensure this project's success!

<p><strong><i>Why run an Indiegogo campaign for T-shirts - why not do a bulk print and sell them individually?</i></strong></p>
<p>Consumer clothing produces an incredible amount of waste, some of which ends up in our oceans. The global average consumption of textiles is around 13kg per person, per year. Along the production chain there can be negative effects from agricultural practices, emissions of chemicals and plastic micro-fibres, and poor working conditions in factories. It sounds unthinkable, but a large portion of the budget fashion produced every year never ends up being worn before it enters landfill.</p>

It strives to bring quality timepieces adding its own touch to bring sempiternal classics at competitive prices.The Sturgeon model is the first of many to come that Maison Héron is proposing. Inspired by the Sturgeon-class Submarines, the Sturgeon watch lures attention thanks to its elegance and its robust silhouette. Being Swiss Made, it is not only sophisticated on the outside but also inside, thanks to the skilled Swiss craftsmanship involved in its fabrication. Automatic watches are the best in the business and Sturgeon brings no less than the cream of the crop: the Swiss Ronda Mecano, mechanical movement.The Sturgeon watch is the fruit of an extensive amount of work and collaboration with our manufacturer from the design of the watch to developing the first prototype. As mentioned before, it was inspired by the Sturgeon Submarines; the infamous nuclear-powered submarines that were used by the Navy since the 60s. Their quality, precision and vigor were what made them great and the Sturgeon watch is no different. The Sturgeon was designed with one goal in mind. It needed to be dressy enough to go with a suit but also sturdy looking to convey the empowering feeling provided by a tool watch. Sturgeon also needed a distinctive feature to make it unique despite its timeless design. The thick arrowed arms were conceived to be the model's aesthetic signature all while serving the purely utilitarian purpose of being easy to read underwater. We collaborated with a Swiss manufacturer that has more than 15 years of experience in the industry to produce our watch. The quality of the prototype they manufactured for us is an example of their professionalism. Upon receiving the prototype, we inspected thoroughly every detail: the polishing of the case and strap, the ceramic bezel brightness and feel, the engraving of the logo on the dial, movement and crown to finally verifying every dimensions. We were very pleased with the prototype and opted to move on and use it as our model.   “SwissMade” engraving is synonym with excellence and the highest quality of craftsmanship. A timepiece who has the honour to showcase this writing is without a doubt reliable, highly durable and polished to the smallest details.STURGEON - A MECHANICAL POWERHOUSE The Sturgeon watch is the result of ultimate luxury paired with unmatched quality. We spared no expenses, our goal was to create a powerhouse of specs and we are extremely satisfied with the outcome.Specifications like 500M-1640FT, Helium Release Valve, 120-minute click Ceramic Bezel are only found on models that range between 5000$ - 10,000$.  CASE: Ø44 mm MEASURES: Lug width 22mm, lug to lug 53mm, thickness 13mm MOVEMENT: Swiss Made Ronda Mecano CRYSTAL: Sapphire Glass HANDS/INDEXES: Snowflakes hands LUME: Swiss Super-LumiNova BEZEL: Ceramic unidirectional 120-minute graduated bezel WATER RESISTANCE: 500M - 1640FT HELIUM RELEASE VALVE  CASE & BRACELET: Marine grade Stainless Steel CROWN: Screw Down CrownThe Sturgeon is powered by a decorated RONDA Mecano R150 movement, which has been praised since it's unveiling at Baselworld. As a matter of fact, it's being used exclusively with a manufacturer that has a partnership with Ronda. It's a mechanical luxury movement with bidirectional automatic winding with ball bearing, date-complication and a 40 hours power reserve.Featuring 25 jewels, this calibre allows us to guarantee an unparalleled level of performance.Swiss movement manufacturer Ronda has been developing astonishing calibers for over 70 years now, placing itself next to the top and most recognized Swiss manufactures. As one of the world's largest manufacturers of mechanical and precision electric quartz watch movement, fundamental values such as precision, reliability and manual craftsmanship are parts of Ronda's core values.Inspired by the Navy’s nuclear submarine, the Sturgeon watch is made of 316L Stainless Steel due to unique resistance properties and popularity among high-end watches.

<h2 style=""margin-left: 210px;"">'Low Poly' Lace Tips<strong> </strong>
</h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>                                                 Designed in NYC, Developed in Berlin</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, my name is Daniel Bailey and i'm a design geek. I'm also a product/footwear designer, charming grizzly bear &amp; shoe entreprenerd.</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">The Story</h2>
<p>I originally started to work on this project after receiving a pair of Yeezy 2's, and then subsequently losing one of my metal lace-tips after the first wear! I thought the idea of having a screw on/off metal lace-tip was super innovative, but thought it could be brought forward to another level in both function, aesthetics &amp; the level of customization (being able to use them for any pair of shoe laces). </p>
<p>What i've come up with is a sculptured lace-tip that's a little more art than just a functional aglet, that fastens onto your shoe lace securely. Simply unscrew the screw on the Lace-Tip, slide the Lace-Tip over your shoe lace and then fasten the screw tightly with the custom screw driver to secure the Lace-Tip in place. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">After a lot of sketches and 3D models, the first samples were all 3D printed out of black ABS plastic &amp; gold plated stainless steel to make sure everything would look great &amp; work properly when I moved forward with the moulding process to have them produced.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I also printed the packaging in 3D, though I have decided to make the final packaging (which will be the same design) in thick card so it has a cleaner finish, with my logo embossed into the lid, and a foam lining at the base to secure the tips, screws &amp; screw driver.</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>I'm currently working on producing my first line of Italian Hand-Made casual/fashion shoes, and plan to use the funds from these Lace-Tips to help with the first order.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Design aesthetics, function &amp; production quality are at the forefront of any product I produce and put my name too, these Lace-Tips and shoes being no exception. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">From the packaging, special hidden details &amp; unique upper patterns to top quality materials &amp; manufacturers, every aspect of the lace tips and shoes has been designed &amp; developed by me personally to give you the ultimate end product &amp; overall user experience.</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Immediate Goals</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Aside from purchasing the moulds and getting everything ready for production, this project is bigger than just these beautiful Lace-Tips! I'm planning on using them to help fund the first order of Italian hand-made MrBailey casual shoes (you can see a sneak peek of me helping in the atelier to make the first samples in the perks below).</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Help Spread the Word</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Please help let people know about this project.  Repost, retweet, re-whatever is possible, Indiegogo makes it easy with their handy share tools.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Thanks for taking the time to check out my project, if you have any questions please feel free to contact me at - </span><a href=""mailto:info@MrBailey.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>info@MrBailey.co.uk</span></a><span> or on Instagram - </span><span>MrBailey_</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Cheers!</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">The Perks</h2>
<p>From the aglet's to the screws, the screw driver to the mini-shoe box packaging, everything has been custom designed by myself to give you the best product that I can.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With each order you'll receive 4 'Low Poly' Lace Tips w/custom screws &amp; screw driver in either gold or gun metal black at the wholesale price. You'll also receive your tips in a custom mini MrBailey shoe box, lined with foam at the base to protect the Lace-Tips and screw driver.</p>

</div></div>","'Low Poly' Lace Tips 

                                                 Designed in NYC, Developed in Berlin
 
Hi, my name is Daniel Bailey and i'm a design geek. I'm also a product/footwear designer, charming grizzly bear & shoe entreprenerd.
The Story
I originally started to work on this project after receiving a pair of Yeezy 2's, and then subsequently losing one of my metal lace-tips after the first wear! I thought the idea of having a screw on/off metal lace-tip was super innovative, but thought it could be brought forward to another level in both function, aesthetics & the level of customization (being able to use them for any pair of shoe laces). 
What i've come up with is a sculptured lace-tip that's a little more art than just a functional aglet, that fastens onto your shoe lace securely. Simply unscrew the screw on the Lace-Tip, slide the Lace-Tip over your shoe lace and then fasten the screw tightly with the custom screw driver to secure the Lace-Tip in place. 
After a lot of sketches and 3D models, the first samples were all 3D printed out of black ABS plastic & gold plated stainless steel to make sure everything would look great & work properly when I moved forward with the moulding process to have them produced.
I also printed the packaging in 3D, though I have decided to make the final packaging (which will be the same design) in thick card so it has a cleaner finish, with my logo embossed into the lid, and a foam lining at the base to secure the tips, screws & screw driver.
The Impact
I'm currently working on producing my first line of Italian Hand-Made casual/fashion shoes, and plan to use the funds from these Lace-Tips to help with the first order.
Design aesthetics, function & production quality are at the forefront of any product I produce and put my name too, these Lace-Tips and shoes being no exception. 
From the packaging, special hidden details & unique upper patterns to top quality materials & manufacturers, every aspect of the lace tips and shoes has been designed & developed by me personally to give you the ultimate end product & overall user experience.
Immediate Goals
Aside from purchasing the moulds and getting everything ready for production, this project is bigger than just these beautiful Lace-Tips! I'm planning on using them to help fund the first order of Italian hand-made MrBailey casual shoes (you can see a sneak peek of me helping in the atelier to make the first samples in the perks below).
Help Spread the Word
Please help let people know about this project.  Repost, retweet, re-whatever is possible, Indiegogo makes it easy with their handy share tools.
Thanks for taking the time to check out my project, if you have any questions please feel free to contact me at - info@MrBailey.co.uk or on Instagram - MrBailey_
Cheers!
The Perks
From the aglet's to the screws, the screw driver to the mini-shoe box packaging, everything has been custom designed by myself to give you the best product that I can.
With each order you'll receive 4 'Low Poly' Lace Tips w/custom screws & screw driver in either gold or gun metal black at the wholesale price. You'll also receive your tips in a custom mini MrBailey shoe box, lined with foam at the base to protect the Lace-Tips and screw driver.

<p><img alt=""Pooghe Clothing Company of America Candid Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k235/scubasteveareno/Pooghe%20Clothing%20Company%20of%20America/Intro_Banner-part3.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Pooghe Clothing Company of America Candid Banner""/></p>
<h3><em><strong>Setting the pace for innovation</strong>, in 2008 Navy Veteran and Pooghe founder Steve Monte saw a need for a true American Made clothing label with undeniable comfort that fitted a person's body better than what was available in the market. Steve went even further on the principles that fashion, and technology can work in unison to create the ideal clothing line that also provided an authentic eco-friendly solution to that natural, yet daily occurrence everyone can identify with - body odor.</em></h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k235/scubasteveareno/Pooghe%20Clothing%20Company%20of%20America/Steve_Intro_Banner.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>A little bit on how we got here:</strong></h3>
<p>An athlete doesn't train endlessly to enter the Olympics with the hopes of only getting a bronze metal; they train with perseverance in going into that arena carrying the conviction at winning the gold.  I approached creating the Pooghe clothing brand with the same mindset. My goal was to create from the ground up, an authentic American Made clothing label that was more than just another brand name.  It had to be an elite and versatile label that addressed an issue relatable to almost anyone, and above all; feature a signature softness and comfort that stood above the rest.</p>
<p>I'll admit to all of you reading this, that we certainly had our fair share of trial and errors getting Pooghe to where it is today, which didn't come easy - nor overnight.  In-fact it took all of four-plus years, along with many personal and family sacrifices that definitely put my determination to the extreme test.</p>
<p>With touring numerous manufacturing, knitting and dye companies, eventually, we strategically partnered ourselves with the right facilities and material sourcing groups.  Endless hours were spent researching and testing just about every type of textile technology for our platform; then producing sample run after sample run that clearly gave an intense education and OJT I never would have anticipated.</p>
<p>Additionally, I felt it was crucial to beta-test Pooghe clothing with real-life consumers across America to include men and women from all walks of life between the ages of 18 - 50. After-all, regardless of how good I may think I am at creating really comfortable garment; the true barometer test in ""getting it just right"" would be in the feedback we would get from actual potential customers who gave all of our samples a decent trial run.</p>
<p>These testing phases turned out to be very extensive and time consuming in making many adjustments to the weight and design of our fabrics; along with multiple silhouette alterations through each stage of our product development.  However, it was an invaluable process that we could ultimately conclude once receiving the communal feedback and visceral response we were aiming for...the ""WOW"" factor.</p>
<p><img alt=""Pooghe Apparel Label:  Made In The United States of America, Thank You &amp; Enjoy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k235/scubasteveareno/Pooghe%20Clothing%20Company%20of%20America/pooghe_label2.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Pooghe Apparel Label:  Made In The United States of America, Thank You &amp; Enjoy""/></p>
<p>Next to offering a clothing label that people can certainly benefit from having; the words <em>Made in the USA</em> is unquestionably one of our ""sacred cows"" in business practices. We not only hold it very dear to us, but it will ALWAYS be a prideful and cardinal part of the Pooghe identity.  As you can probably guess, being a Navy Veteran, I have incredible enthusiasm as we look forward to in contributing on a much larger scale to the social and economic arenas with an exclusive apparel brand that is authentic, enjoyable to wear and truly Made in America.</p>
<h3>The Impact of your contributions:</h3>
<p>The impact of your contributions has much to do with bringing Pooghe to fruition. In order for us to offer Pooghe to the public for both retail and wholesale, we now have to do a production run of fabric and manufacturing the silhouettes we created with final cut &amp; sew and finish. Just about all fabric manufactured here in the US that are similar to ours (Jersey knits, French Terry, etc.) is done by using ready-made yarns which almost always have a denier in 20s, 30s, or 40s (thickness).  However, we created our ""Signature"" fabric which is a an exclusive Supima cotton jersey made from a particular 24/1 denier yarn.  Conventionally, it's unheard of in using that specific yarn weight to make fabric here in America, and I'll tell you why...</p>
<p>When you move to a precise yarn weight/thickness outside of the standard three that everyone typically uses; a knitting mill has to rethread and recalibrating their production machines for that specific yarn weight. Most companies will not want to go through the trouble so they will stick with what's already being made.  Knitting mills are willing to do small yardage runs on their sampling machines of which they charge you dearly for that.  But, when it comes to manufacturing beyond the sampling/prototype phases, the minimum yardage you have to order for a unique yarn weight is very large, and it can range anywhere from 5,000-10,000 yards. To put it into perspective, we have to order all of that fabric before we can even cut &amp; sew one shirt.</p>
<p>Now as I stated earlier we strategically partnered ourselves with the right knitting &amp; manufacturing facilities that are willing to work with us, but we still have to meet their large minimum production guidelines. Our family has gone as far as we could on our own financially, so without being able to do a production size run on both fabric and manufacturing we can't bring the Pooghe label to fruition.</p>
<p>The funding we need to cover the costs is $25,000, which we set our goal under the Fixed Funding guidelines [meaning, our project campaign cannot happen unless we raise the full amount]. Currently, we have a good bundle of companies from boutiques to commercial businesses that are all interested in the Pooghe label. However, before we can proceed with even attempting to materialize any of those strong potential platforms, we need to make this campaign happen.  Additionally, we want to offer Pooghe clothing to the open market on our website as well. </p>
<p>Thus...when I say, I wholeheartedly thank you in advance for all of your generous contributions to this campaign; please know that I deeply and humbly mean it. Because folks, the actualization is simple - in that it's truly YOUR contributions that will launch Pooghe.   </p>
<h3>Pride in using The World's Finest Cotton:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Supima® Cotton is 100% American Pima Cotton trademark named Supima for superior-pima. Known as the ""World's Finest Cotton,"" Supima is so exclusive, less than 1% of the world's cotton can be called Supima which is grown only in California and the southwest region of the United States. It's superior in softness to all other cottons due to the physically longer strands of fiber that make up the cotton threads.</p>
<p><img alt=""Supima Cotton License "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k235/scubasteveareno/Pooghe%20Clothing%20Company%20of%20America/Supima-Certificate.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Supima Cotton License""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We use Supima cotton in our fabrics because it creates a stronger but incredibly soft, smooth and lustrous surface that is simply UNMATCHED. Once you have it next to your skin, it'll leave no question as to why Supima cotton carries the respected title worldwide as ""The Cashmere of Cottons.""</p>
<p>Supima has shown us nothing less than amazing support and encouragement since we introduced our plans for Pooghe to them in the beginning. We are very humbled and proud to now be a member and licensee of Supima since 2010, for both our exclusive garments and the fabrics created for Pooghe Clothing Company of America.</p>
<h3>About our fabric technology:</h3>
<p>Revolutionary Biocompatible Eco-Friendly Fabric Technology  - Keeping You Confidently Fresh Day In &amp; Day Out</p>
<p>• Biocompatible - Meaning we use the same active: Hydrogen Peroxide H202 that the human body produces to defend itself from bacterial invaders (the phagocytosis process). Unlike other antimicrobials on the market, our exclusive fabric technology is NON-leaching and FREE of organic halogens such as Triclosan or PCBs, Cationic finishes, Silvers or Coppers. Our revolutionary antimicrobial fabric technology is safe, non-toxic, non-irritating and non-sensitizing to the skin.</p>
<p>• Controls Odor and Staining - No more irritating fabric discoloration's most people can relate to with the infamous ""yellowing"" of the armpits. The rapid acting and long lasting treatment controls odors and staining by inhibiting bacteria and fungi growth, which are the culprits in causing unpleasant odors, discoloration, staining and deterioration of garments.</p>
<p>• Environmentally Friendly Technology—the only antimicrobial fabric technology containing hydrogen peroxide approved by US EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) for imparting antimicrobial preservation of textiles. It degrades to water and oxygen leaving no dangerous or negative ecological decomposition products. It's the superior most eco-friendly antimicrobial/antifungal textile technology available today.</p>
<p>• Superior and Long lasting – independent lab analysis confirms the effectiveness of our fabrics lasts through 75 laundering cycles as compared to the other antimicrobials that only maintain their efficacy from 1-10 washings.</p>
<p>• Consumers have moved to short-cycle cold-water washes to save energy and decrease the wear and tear on clothing and other fabrics; however, this unfortunately can leave bacteria and viruses largely intact. With your Pooghe apparel, there's no special handling, you can wash in hot or cold water, with or without bleach.</p>
<h3>How does our antimicrobial fabric treatment basically work?</h3>
<p>Pooghes' revolutionary textile treatment locks the power of hydrogen peroxide into its fabrics. It's specially designed to allow very low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide to effectively inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi, which cause unpleasant odors, discoloration, staining, deterioration or corrosion of garments. The two fabric samples below were heavily inoculated, incubated and then photographed after three days. The untreated fabric to the left shows almost complete overgrowth while Pooghe's treated fabric shows no growth.</p>
<p><img alt=""Pooghe Fabric Comparison"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k235/scubasteveareno/Pooghe%20Clothing%20Company%20of%20America/fabric_comparison.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Pooghe Fabric Comparison""/></p>
<p><em>Microbes can feed off human perspiration and body oils, resulting in odorous by-products. Our eco-treatment suppresses the generation of odors by inhibiting microbial growth on the fabric.</em></p>

</div></div>","Setting the pace for innovation, in 2008 Navy Veteran and Pooghe founder Steve Monte saw a need for a true American Made clothing label with undeniable comfort that fitted a person's body better than what was available in the market. Steve went even further on the principles that fashion, and technology can work in unison to create the ideal clothing line that also provided an authentic eco-friendly solution to that natural, yet daily occurrence everyone can identify with - body odor.

A little bit on how we got here:
An athlete doesn't train endlessly to enter the Olympics with the hopes of only getting a bronze metal; they train with perseverance in going into that arena carrying the conviction at winning the gold.  I approached creating the Pooghe clothing brand with the same mindset. My goal was to create from the ground up, an authentic American Made clothing label that was more than just another brand name.  It had to be an elite and versatile label that addressed an issue relatable to almost anyone, and above all; feature a signature softness and comfort that stood above the rest.
I'll admit to all of you reading this, that we certainly had our fair share of trial and errors getting Pooghe to where it is today, which didn't come easy - nor overnight.  In-fact it took all of four-plus years, along with many personal and family sacrifices that definitely put my determination to the extreme test.
With touring numerous manufacturing, knitting and dye companies, eventually, we strategically partnered ourselves with the right facilities and material sourcing groups.  Endless hours were spent researching and testing just about every type of textile technology for our platform; then producing sample run after sample run that clearly gave an intense education and OJT I never would have anticipated.
Additionally, I felt it was crucial to beta-test Pooghe clothing with real-life consumers across America to include men and women from all walks of life between the ages of 18 - 50. After-all, regardless of how good I may think I am at creating really comfortable garment; the true barometer test in ""getting it just right"" would be in the feedback we would get from actual potential customers who gave all of our samples a decent trial run.
These testing phases turned out to be very extensive and time consuming in making many adjustments to the weight and design of our fabrics; along with multiple silhouette alterations through each stage of our product development.  However, it was an invaluable process that we could ultimately conclude once receiving the communal feedback and visceral response we were aiming for...the ""WOW"" factor.

Next to offering a clothing label that people can certainly benefit from having; the words Made in the USA is unquestionably one of our ""sacred cows"" in business practices. We not only hold it very dear to us, but it will ALWAYS be a prideful and cardinal part of the Pooghe identity.  As you can probably guess, being a Navy Veteran, I have incredible enthusiasm as we look forward to in contributing on a much larger scale to the social and economic arenas with an exclusive apparel brand that is authentic, enjoyable to wear and truly Made in America.
The Impact of your contributions:
The impact of your contributions has much to do with bringing Pooghe to fruition. In order for us to offer Pooghe to the public for both retail and wholesale, we now have to do a production run of fabric and manufacturing the silhouettes we created with final cut & sew and finish. Just about all fabric manufactured here in the US that are similar to ours (Jersey knits, French Terry, etc.) is done by using ready-made yarns which almost always have a denier in 20s, 30s, or 40s (thickness).  However, we created our ""Signature"" fabric which is a an exclusive Supima cotton jersey made from a particular 24/1 denier yarn.  Conventionally, it's unheard of in using that specific yarn weight to make fabric here in America, and I'll tell you why...
When you move to a precise yarn weight/thickness outside of the standard three that everyone typically uses; a knitting mill has to rethread and recalibrating their production machines for that specific yarn weight. Most companies will not want to go through the trouble so they will stick with what's already being made.  Knitting mills are willing to do small yardage runs on their sampling machines of which they charge you dearly for that.  But, when it comes to manufacturing beyond the sampling/prototype phases, the minimum yardage you have to order for a unique yarn weight is very large, and it can range anywhere from 5,000-10,000 yards. To put it into perspective, we have to order all of that fabric before we can even cut & sew one shirt.
Now as I stated earlier we strategically partnered ourselves with the right knitting & manufacturing facilities that are willing to work with us, but we still have to meet their large minimum production guidelines. Our family has gone as far as we could on our own financially, so without being able to do a production size run on both fabric and manufacturing we can't bring the Pooghe label to fruition.
The funding we need to cover the costs is $25,000, which we set our goal under the Fixed Funding guidelines [meaning, our project campaign cannot happen unless we raise the full amount]. Currently, we have a good bundle of companies from boutiques to commercial businesses that are all interested in the Pooghe label. However, before we can proceed with even attempting to materialize any of those strong potential platforms, we need to make this campaign happen.  Additionally, we want to offer Pooghe clothing to the open market on our website as well. 
Thus...when I say, I wholeheartedly thank you in advance for all of your generous contributions to this campaign; please know that I deeply and humbly mean it. Because folks, the actualization is simple - in that it's truly YOUR contributions that will launch Pooghe.   
Pride in using The World's Finest Cotton:


Supima® Cotton is 100% American Pima Cotton trademark named Supima for superior-pima. Known as the ""World's Finest Cotton,"" Supima is so exclusive, less than 1% of the world's cotton can be called Supima which is grown only in California and the southwest region of the United States. It's superior in softness to all other cottons due to the physically longer strands of fiber that make up the cotton threads.

 
We use Supima cotton in our fabrics because it creates a stronger but incredibly soft, smooth and lustrous surface that is simply UNMATCHED. Once you have it next to your skin, it'll leave no question as to why Supima cotton carries the respected title worldwide as ""The Cashmere of Cottons.""
Supima has shown us nothing less than amazing support and encouragement since we introduced our plans for Pooghe to them in the beginning. We are very humbled and proud to now be a member and licensee of Supima since 2010, for both our exclusive garments and the fabrics created for Pooghe Clothing Company of America.
About our fabric technology:
Revolutionary Biocompatible Eco-Friendly Fabric Technology  - Keeping You Confidently Fresh Day In & Day Out
• Biocompatible - Meaning we use the same active: Hydrogen Peroxide H202 that the human body produces to defend itself from bacterial invaders (the phagocytosis process). Unlike other antimicrobials on the market, our exclusive fabric technology is NON-leaching and FREE of organic halogens such as Triclosan or PCBs, Cationic finishes, Silvers or Coppers. Our revolutionary antimicrobial fabric technology is safe, non-toxic, non-irritating and non-sensitizing to the skin.
• Controls Odor and Staining - No more irritating fabric discoloration's most people can relate to with the infamous ""yellowing"" of the armpits. The rapid acting and long lasting treatment controls odors and staining by inhibiting bacteria and fungi growth, which are the culprits in causing unpleasant odors, discoloration, staining and deterioration of garments.
• Environmentally Friendly Technology—the only antimicrobial fabric technology containing hydrogen peroxide approved by US EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) for imparting antimicrobial preservation of textiles. It degrades to water and oxygen leaving no dangerous or negative ecological decomposition products. It's the superior most eco-friendly antimicrobial/antifungal textile technology available today.
• Superior and Long lasting – independent lab analysis confirms the effectiveness of our fabrics lasts through 75 laundering cycles as compared to the other antimicrobials that only maintain their efficacy from 1-10 washings.
• Consumers have moved to short-cycle cold-water washes to save energy and decrease the wear and tear on clothing and other fabrics; however, this unfortunately can leave bacteria and viruses largely intact. With your Pooghe apparel, there's no special handling, you can wash in hot or cold water, with or without bleach.
How does our antimicrobial fabric treatment basically work?
Pooghes' revolutionary textile treatment locks the power of hydrogen peroxide into its fabrics. It's specially designed to allow very low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide to effectively inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi, which cause unpleasant odors, discoloration, staining, deterioration or corrosion of garments. The two fabric samples below were heavily inoculated, incubated and then photographed after three days. The untreated fabric to the left shows almost complete overgrowth while Pooghe's treated fabric shows no growth.

Microbes can feed off human perspiration and body oils, resulting in odorous by-products. Our eco-treatment suppresses the generation of odors by inhibiting microbial growth on the fabric.

These aren't your grandma's glasses.Morpheye Eyewear will minimize and modernize your wardrobe by eliminating the need for multiple frames to fit your life.   Choose any of the five shapes!Titanium is naturally hypoallergenic and anti-corrosive which is perfect wearing all day, everyday. The lightweight and durability factors also make titanium the best choice for these versatile frames. Titanium is 40% lighter and as strong as traditional steel. These frames have great flexibility and memory, which is important for strength and longevity.With the durability of titanium we are able to do cool things like the fish skeleton cut on the ear piece. This allows you to create your own custom fit with your bare hands. Bend the ear pieces to contour to the shape of your ears and head. Revolutionary manufacturing methods made Morpheye Magnetic Snaps possible. These lightweight and colorfully designed shells, magnetically snap onto the front of the Morpheye frame. They can quickly change the look and function of your eyewear.To see the Snaps up close, CLICK HEREAll Snap colors and textures come in all five frame shapes!All varieties of sunglass lenses can be placed into any Snap.Whether you leave them in the sun of your car or accidentally sit on your Snaps, the nylon material will hold its shape unlike acetate frames. Paired with neodymium magnets to connect them to the frames, they will not fall off in any outdoor activity.The manufacturing process is only found in the Morpheye factory and is the secret to the thin Snaps. We wanted to create a frame material that would be light, thin and durable so you can carry them in your pocket without a care. This material didn’t exist in the market, so we created it.No more stacking cheap 3D theater frames on top of your Rx glasses. With a simple Snap, you can comfortably wear your own Morpheye frames and watch the latest movie in 3D. Add on or trade out one of your Sunglasses Snaps for the 3D Movie Package and you will get two 3D Snaps built for RealD and IMAX 3D movies. The two Snaps come in a standard black color. Add on this package for $25. Overexposure to blue light can lead to eye strain, headaches and disruption of the natural sleep cycle. The lens of the Morpheye Base Frame has an included blue light filter to provide you a better digital screen viewing experience all day and long into the night. This will help you stay focused on your work for longer time periods.Included in every reward package are free single-vision prescriptions up to +/- 3.0. Visit any optometrist to get your prescription and we will fill it once the campaign ends. Our lenses are made from the high quality CR39. This material is half as heavy as glass, far less likely to shatter and has optical quality nearly as good as glass. After +/- 3.0 there will be $20 upgrade fee because we will have to choose a high index lens that is much thinner than the standard lens and is meant for higher prescriptions.For more information about prescriptions please visit our FAQ section.You wear sunscreen when you go outside so why not wear eye protection?

The umbrella octopus species, aka Dumbo octopus, is the cutest octopus in the world.The name “Dumbo” originates from their resemblance to 1941 Disney's film ""Dumbo, the elephant"", having a prominent ear-like fin which extends from the mantle above each eye.The Dumbo octopuses use these ear-like fins to propel themselves through the water and arms to steer through water currents. Their arms are connected by a web of skin, causing them to resemble umbrellas when their arms are spread apart.Unlike most octopuses, the Dumbo octopus doesn’t have an ink sac because it rarely encounters predators in the deep sea. Even so, they still have the distinctive octopus capability and ability to “flush” or “camouflage” themselves to their environment when danger occurs.A 46mm watch case“This watch is too big for my wrist!”Not to worry, guys.The watch design concept is inspired by the Dumbo Octopus, which has the capability and ability to “flush” and “camouflage” into the environment.“FLUSH”Traditional watches have either protruding crown or “intentionally protruding” crown guard added to protect their fragile crown. For Dumbo, its screwed-down crown “FLUSH” with the watch case. The crown is protected by the watch case even in the most extreme use.This design made it both functional and aesthetically pleasing. “CAMOUFLAGE”Dumbo uses a “CAMOUFLAGE” lug. Using this design concept, wearer will find the 46mm diameter case equivalent to a traditional 36.60mm watch case.  1) Marine Grade Bronze CuSn8CuSn8 is a industry standard for marine grade alloy. It contains a composition of 92% copper and 8% tin. For many centuries, bronze is used in many nautical applications for its unique metal characteristics. Bronze is highly corrosion resistant to seawater. It shows no sign of corrosion even after years of exposure to seawater.During manufacturing, the watch case is polished to rose gold shine. A layer called “patina” is then allowed to form on the watch. “Patina” is a layer of oxide that protects the metal from corrosion. Every “patina pattern” is unique and different, depending on wearer’s usage and the enviroment. Wearer can revert back to it “polish state”, by polishing it with any polishing agent on the market to bring back its rose gold shine.2) Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) 316L Stainless SteelDLC stands for Diamond-Like Carbon. It is a nanocomposite coating that has unique properties of natural diamond - low friction, high hardness, and high corrosion resistance. DLC coatings are usually found on high end watches as it is scratch & corrosion resistant, which is more superior to PVD coatings.3) Surgical Grade 316L Stainless Steel316L is also referred to marine grade stainless. Its primary alloying constituents are iron, chromium, nickel and molybdenum. The additional of molybdenum strengthens its corrosion resistant properties. The “L” refers to its low carbon content. Why SW200 and NH35 movements? The answer is obvious - the best of both worlds (28.8kph/4Hz & 21.6kph/3Hz). They are the most reliable, versatile and robust movements on the market. Both companies have long history in watch movements manufacturing, which they have perfected over the years.1) SELLITA SW200This movement needs no introduction as SW200 is well known to every watch lover. The SW200 is precise, reliable and robust. Its quality and reliability are comparable to ETA 2824, some may even say SW200 is better.2) SEIKO NH35Another popular movement used in many dive watches. NH35 is well known for its reliability. It can outlast Swiss movement with minimum or no servicing. Most watchmakers play it safe when it comes to dial design. It’s either in common plain or sunburst finish.MMI Watches wants every part of the watch’s design to be unique and stands out from the rest.The Dumbo's dial is given an ultra fine horizontal brushed finish. With this textured finish, the dial is able to present two tones, dark and brillant effects, depending on the enviromental lighthings.A particular dial deserves a special mention – the great “White”.The great “White” is available on model DB6NHS, DB6SWS, DB7NHS and DB7SWS. This intially an experimental dial. We are astonished by its end result. The effects came out far better than we had anticipated.The great “White” is actually a silver dial. Instead of the other two changing tones of the other DUMBOs, the great “White” changes colors from Silver to Magnificent Cream to Brilliant  White, depending on the environment lightings, like an octopus camouflaging into its enviroment.SilverMagnificent CreamBrilliant  WhiteThere are 2 models for each design. The 2 sets of alpha-numeric under each design represent their model numbers.The model number indicates the model, color combination, type of movement and case material.Example: DB6NHS (WWXYYZ)WW=DB (refer to Dumbo model)X= 6 (refer to blue bezel insert,  blue chapter ring and white dial color combination)YY= NH (refer to NH35 movement)Z= S (refer to stainless steel case material)Example: DB3SWC (WWXYYZ)WW=DB (refer to Dumbo model)X= 3 (refer to green bezel insert,  green chapter ring and green dial color combination)YY= SW (refer to SW200 movement)Z= C (refer to CUSN8 case material)Case: - 46mm Diameter / Lug To Lug- 24mm Concealed Lug- 14.6mm Thickness Without Dome Sapphire CrystalCase Material:- 316L Surgical Grade Stainless Steel, - DIamond Like Carbon (DLC) Black 316L Surgical Grade Stainless Steel- CuSn8 Marine Grade BronzeBezel/Insert:- 120 Clicks Uni-Direction Bezel- Ceramic Insert filled with BGW9 Swiss Super LumiNovaDial:- Horizontal Brushed Dial- Hands and Indexes filled with BGW9 Swiss Super LumiNovaMovement:- SELLITA SW200- SEIKO NH35Water Resistance:- 500m with Helium Escape ValveCrystal:- 4mm Dome Sapphire Crystal With Anti Reflective CoatingCrown:- Signed Screw Down CrownRather than packaging the watch in cardboard or plastic box, which most likely will end up in a trash bin, every watch comes with a multi-purpose watch travel case, which is suitable for daily use. The travel case will not only hold your precious watch, it can also store your personal belongings such as your passport, handphone, charging cables, power bank and etc.We have kept the cost of the watch to the lowest possible without sacrificing its quality, so as to make Dumbo accessible to all backers. Currently, the multi-purpose travel case is made out of PU leather material.

<h3>Brand Message</h3>
<p>In a timepiece, “10"" can stand for Ten seconds, Ten minutes, Ten hours or the 10th of each month. “10"" always appears when it comes to time telling. “10"" is also the number of styles in this project.

A startup brand aims to create the next generation of “most affordable watch” on the principle “simplicity of designs”. Nothing new, nothing ground-breaking, just a pure rendition of what watches would have looked like.




Brand Message
In a timepiece, “10"" can stand for Ten seconds, Ten minutes, Ten hours or the 10th of each month. “10"" always appears when it comes to time telling. “10"" is also the number of styles in this project. That is the reason why we took “10"" to be our brand name and the DNA that every of our designs carries. 
Lifestyle brand empowers people to look good and get the best out of themselves. We take it one step further by inspiring people to look for and get even more out of their life. You pursue what you love and cherish, and you make every moment counts.
Messages enrooted in our products:
- Producing affordable, high-quality and practical timepieces
- Exploring the possibility of wrist fashion
- Timepieces are not necessarily luxurious. They can be optimized for everyday wear
We will be selling our watches via our website: www.the10watches.com. We can thus eliminate all the unnecessary expenses on advertising, dealers and trade shows, and make the price more affordable to our Backers.
Chronograph Collection
Redefine Gentlemen Chronograph as an everyday watch. 
The case is 42mm in diameter and 11.5mm thick. The chronograph collection is driven by six-hand premium Japanese quartz chronograph movements. This watch also features a quick-release strap pin for interchanging to all 22mm straps. No muss, no fuss.
We believe The 10 Watches will be your perfect companion to all different occasions of your life.

Our philosophy is that life is a battle and we want to equip you with the confidence you need to stay strong and fight like a warrior in order to succeed.These virtues are the main inspiration behind our brand. The name VALIMOR is a combination of VALiant and arMOR, the most important elements for every warrior, while our brand trademark logo is inspired by auspicious patterns.Eternity Sword CollectionEach watch in this collection is equipped with a Japanese-made automatic mechanical movement from renowned movement maker, Miyota. The designs are inspired by powerful symbolic elements found on ancient swords and armour. Each part of this watch is an original design and developed independently to suit the individual watch. Our designer and engineers have spent more than a year, using their excellent watch-making skills to perfect our vision for the ultimate wristwatch design. With an intense level of craftsmanship our engineers turn hard metal materials into every unique and stylish watch part: Including the watch case inspired by dragon scales engraved on ancient armour, the sword shaped hands, the crown shaped watch crown, the dragon hide inspired leather strap, the hilt shaped metal strap buckle and the natural stone dial designs; all combine ancient elements with modern technology and watch making, creating a timeless and different watch series.      Extra straps and choosing your strap options!You will be able to choice any strap model for your original pledge or buy extra straps and expand your strap choices by comments on our project page. All Caliburnus straps are equipped with a Quick Release Pin, so you don't need any tools to change the strap. You can easily switch between different straps, including leather straps and metal bracelets.Aged metal braceletWe finally chose ‘Option C’s' Metal Bracelet by our Kickstarter backers, which will use high-quality Solid Links structure, and doublebutton butterfly clasp. With the interchangeable structure, you can exchange our new metal bracelet for leather straps without any tools. The metal strap is now officially in the development stage. The design and drawings have been completed. And we expect that all tests will be completed in 4 weeks. After the sample progress is completed, photos of the finished bracelet will be available. We will try to provide photos after we completed the development of all fine-tuned details of the first sample. The expected delivery is in Oct, 2018 which is same as your watches. DETAILS:While the originality and uniqueness of the exterior design is important, it’s in the quality of the production and the movement underneath the dial that our watches really stand out from bulk of entry level to mid tier wristwatches on the market. A lot of attention goes into every detail of the watches to create timepieces that will serve you for many years to come. Below we will introduce some of the key features of our designs.CASE & CROWN: VALIMOR fuses traditional high precision craftsmanship and contemporary design into a hard-stainless steel case through delicate engraving. The manufacturing process simplifies our trademark dragon design into a unique watch case with a dragon scale engraved steel bezel. The final look births a unique yet classic watch series. We use innovative PVD coating to add the antiquing effect to the solid and hard-wearing 316L stainless steel. PVD coated stainless steel ensures tough quality and maximum durability from our cases. In 2018, the VALIMOR design was patented in 28 members states of the European Union (EUIPO Design Patent #004742294-0001).Dial:This unique design is inspired by the legendary story of King Arthur and the Sword in the Stone. With jewellery-grade natural stones, each dial has a rich and unique texture, pattern, colour and personality. No two watches are the same do to the one-of-a-kind nature of the materials, making it a unique watch for watch lovers and collectors.HANDS: In addition to using DIAMOND-CUT technology to cut the outline of the hands with ultimate precision, the hands feature a complex semi-polishing techniques that is usually reserved for high-end watches. Using this technique the hands are polished on one side and brushed on the other for a unique, yet subtle and understated, aesthetic. This design does not just serve to provide a high-end look, it keeps the contrast of the hands against the dial throughout different reflection and lighting conditions, to improve legibility and make it easier to read time. Taking into account the activities of the night, we use Swiss SuperLumiNova® BGW9 pigments for the lume on the watch hands to secure perfect legibility in the dark. The pigments are non-radioactive and environmental friendly. SuperLumiNova® is the preferred luminous pigment of Swiss watch industry and is renowned for keeping its luminescence well as time passes, to serve you for many years to come.MOVEMENT: To attain maximum reliability we employ the stable Japanese-made MIYOTA 821A Automatic Mechanical Movement in all our watches.

<p><strong>Dangle</strong>, the world's first minimalist credit card case for a new titanium Apple Card. A card case redefined as a versatile lifestyle accessory and a lifehacker. Regular card cases available in the market are just variations of a wallet that is stored in a bag or pocket, and the credit card needs to be taken out of the bag and then out of the wallet for transactions. With Dangle, you no longer need to dig through your bag and then struggle to get the card out of the wallet. Dangle is worn around neck, wrist, or waist or clipped onto a bag. All you have to do is flip the cover and touch the machine. Dangle is a verb that means an object is hang or swing loosely that perfectly translate our product and our brand. Dangle provides a subtle but innovative lifestyle experience while functioning as an accessory statement.</p>
<p><i>* Dangle is born from idea inspired by the launch of <a href=""https://www.apple.com/apple-card/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Apple Card </a>from Apple Inc. in 2019 </i></p>

<p>Dangle is thin, slim and convenient for you to wear and carry it however you prefer. Dangle’s soft and elastic silicone encapsulates your beautiful titanium Apple Card from scratching, getting dirty, and chipping out. The connector on the top left side, made with more solid material joined with soft silicone, adds structural element to stabilize the case while preventing potential damage when connected with a ring or a necklace. Dangle offers different color options for the connector as an accent to the design and provides individualistic style element.</p>

<p><strong>Intuitive Design and Form Factor</strong></p>

<p>Dangle’s intuitive design is inspired by our own experience and created based on our ergonomics research and observing user interactions with credit card and payment machine. We strongly believed convenience and ease of use is achieved by simplicity in form factor that ultimately gives greater moment of pleasure for users. Minimalist aesthetics of Dangle translates to functions that are self-explanatory. Users are attracted by soft and elastic texture and naturally and gently flip the case whenever they swipe or insert Apple Card into credit card machine and intuitively understands to flex back slip. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Material: Silicone</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572905593/oa5afrudi4gzeofzjboh.svg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Dangle’s minimal but multi-functional design was achieved by high-performance material silicone. Silicone offers the right amount of elasticity, and its stable material lasts long while retaining its color. In addition, its durability withstands extreme temperature and is resistant to heat and moisture. Silicone has smooth and non-stick surface that is easy to clean and dismisses odor or grease. It is safe to human and widely used such as in medical or kitchen appliances. Therefore, it is a perfect material to cover your titanium Apple Card preventing scratches, dirt, and damage. Dangle intentionally uses translucent silicone to highlight form and colors of Apple Card.</p>

<p>Designing Dangle as a wearable was one of our key ideas. You can essentially wear it on your body or play with it as a ring, band, necklace or whatever you like to mix and match like a fashion accessory and let it “dangle”. You can hang AirPod, car keys, house keys, and Dangle to complete your fashion style head to toe.</p>

<p>Our idea started from our own experience and the need for an intuitive and versatile credit card case. After receiving the first ever physical Apple Card, as much as we love the beautiful aesthetics of the new credit card, we saw the need for a case to safely carry the card.</p>
<p>We found that Apple mentioned protecting and maintaining the condition of titanium Apple Card  in <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210399"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Apple website</a>and provided cleaning, storing, and carrying guide. According to Apple, a titanium Apple Card comes into contact with hard surfaces or materials, it's possible that the coating can be damaged and also comes in contact with contaminants that can cause stains. Apple provides guides as below on how to safely store and carry titanium Apple Card. (*excerpted from <a href=""http://he%20notes%20are%20excerpted%20from"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Apple website</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Store your titanium Apple Card in a wallet, pocket, or bag made of soft materials.</li>
<li>Place your card in a slot in your wallet or billfold without touching another credit card. If two credit cards are placed in the same slot your card could become scratched.</li>
<li>Don't place or store your titanium Apple Card card near magnets. If your card is placed close to a magnetic latch on a purse or bag, the magnetic strip can become demagnetized.</li>
<li>Don't place your titanium Apple Card in a pocket or bag that contains loose change, keys, or other potentially abrasive objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine a few different scenarios: You are trying to go for a run after work with a cell phone in your hand and AirPod on your ears. You ponder ‘Should I bring my wallet or credit card holder?’ for a few minutes. Your hands are full of your belongings and you have a thirst for water, and you are struggling to find your sweaty pocket while everyone behind you is waiting for you to pay the cashier.</p>
<p>From our experience and user observation for a typical wallet or card case usage, we learned about pain points; users first need to find the wallet from a bag, then take out the card from the wallet to swipe or insert the card onto the machine only to then put the card back to the wallet and to the bag. Mobile payments and wireless RFID card made life much easier for users but in reality, payment infrastructures are not always up-to-date. We researched products in the market and we were not satisfied with existing products as they are too bulky, overcomplicated, too gimmicky, too expensive, and moreover it did not look stylish. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573005627/t7sk6ruxgwqg0jyyxptr.svg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How We Solved.</strong></p>
<p>In the very beginning, our team brainstormed to improve an existing card case with more functions to protect the Apple Card containing sensitive Titanium.</p>
<p>Unlike other credit cards, Apple Card only has user name engraved on the card without any information typically written on a credit card. We assumed such minimalistic design was possible because the society is becoming cashless with more virtual transactions on digital platforms. A credit card is more of a symbolic medium of a lifestyle than a physical object with values. Therefore, our team agreed that a wallet no longer has the same meaning or value to users. After careful trend and culture research, our team came up with a bold idea of a credit card case as a wearable accessory.</p>
<p>Our design goals contained threefolds; subtle design that improves your daily life and reflects the change in society, material that is easy to manufacture and manipulate, and a wearable product that can be customized and fashionable.</p>

<p>Dangle will be produced by assembling silicone and plastic parts that are manufactured with injection molding. Silicone products are widely manufactured and sold in the market. Silicone is a material that is relatively easy to create molds and manufacture by injection molding with a single mold instead of using two molds.

</div></div>","Dangle, the world's first minimalist credit card case for a new titanium Apple Card. A card case redefined as a versatile lifestyle accessory and a lifehacker. Regular card cases available in the market are just variations of a wallet that is stored in a bag or pocket, and the credit card needs to be taken out of the bag and then out of the wallet for transactions. With Dangle, you no longer need to dig through your bag and then struggle to get the card out of the wallet. Dangle is worn around neck, wrist, or waist or clipped onto a bag. All you have to do is flip the cover and touch the machine. Dangle is a verb that means an object is hang or swing loosely that perfectly translate our product and our brand. Dangle provides a subtle but innovative lifestyle experience while functioning as an accessory statement.
* Dangle is born from idea inspired by the launch of Apple Card from Apple Inc. in 2019 



 
 


Product Design Concept

Dangle is thin, slim and convenient for you to wear and carry it however you prefer. Dangle’s soft and elastic silicone encapsulates your beautiful titanium Apple Card from scratching, getting dirty, and chipping out. The connector on the top left side, made with more solid material joined with soft silicone, adds structural element to stabilize the case while preventing potential damage when connected with a ring or a necklace. Dangle offers different color options for the connector as an accent to the design and provides individualistic style element.
 
Intuitive Design and Form Factor

Dangle’s intuitive design is inspired by our own experience and created based on our ergonomics research and observing user interactions with credit card and payment machine. We strongly believed convenience and ease of use is achieved by simplicity in form factor that ultimately gives greater moment of pleasure for users. Minimalist aesthetics of Dangle translates to functions that are self-explanatory. Users are attracted by soft and elastic texture and naturally and gently flip the case whenever they swipe or insert Apple Card into credit card machine and intuitively understands to flex back slip. 
 
Material: Silicone

Dangle’s minimal but multi-functional design was achieved by high-performance material silicone. Silicone offers the right amount of elasticity, and its stable material lasts long while retaining its color. In addition, its durability withstands extreme temperature and is resistant to heat and moisture. Silicone has smooth and non-stick surface that is easy to clean and dismisses odor or grease. It is safe to human and widely used such as in medical or kitchen appliances. Therefore, it is a perfect material to cover your titanium Apple Card preventing scratches, dirt, and damage. Dangle intentionally uses translucent silicone to highlight form and colors of Apple Card.
 
Wear with Style

Designing Dangle as a wearable was one of our key ideas. You can essentially wear it on your body or play with it as a ring, band, necklace or whatever you like to mix and match like a fashion accessory and let it “dangle”. You can hang AirPod, car keys, house keys, and Dangle to complete your fashion style head to toe.
 
 

Wear Dangle when you... 

Riding: Scooter & Skateboard
Athleisure: Yoga, Gym, Running & etc.
Travel: Hiking, Travel Carrier
Party: Hang on Tote or Belt Bag
Urban life: Bike, Subway, Yellow taxi


 
How to use when you insert chip

 
 

Design Problems We Discovered. 

Our idea started from our own experience and the need for an intuitive and versatile credit card case. After receiving the first ever physical Apple Card, as much as we love the beautiful aesthetics of the new credit card, we saw the need for a case to safely carry the card.
We found that Apple mentioned protecting and maintaining the condition of titanium Apple Card  in the Apple websiteand provided cleaning, storing, and carrying guide. According to Apple, a titanium Apple Card comes into contact with hard surfaces or materials, it's possible that the coating can be damaged and also comes in contact with contaminants that can cause stains. Apple provides guides as below on how to safely store and carry titanium Apple Card. (*excerpted from Apple website)

Store your titanium Apple Card in a wallet, pocket, or bag made of soft materials.
Place your card in a slot in your wallet or billfold without touching another credit card. If two credit cards are placed in the same slot your card could become scratched.
Don't place or store your titanium Apple Card card near magnets. If your card is placed close to a magnetic latch on a purse or bag, the magnetic strip can become demagnetized.
Don't place your titanium Apple Card in a pocket or bag that contains loose change, keys, or other potentially abrasive objects.

Imagine a few different scenarios: You are trying to go for a run after work with a cell phone in your hand and AirPod on your ears. You ponder ‘Should I bring my wallet or credit card holder?’ for a few minutes. Your hands are full of your belongings and you have a thirst for water, and you are struggling to find your sweaty pocket while everyone behind you is waiting for you to pay the cashier.
From our experience and user observation for a typical wallet or card case usage, we learned about pain points; users first need to find the wallet from a bag, then take out the card from the wallet to swipe or insert the card onto the machine only to then put the card back to the wallet and to the bag. Mobile payments and wireless RFID card made life much easier for users but in reality, payment infrastructures are not always up-to-date. We researched products in the market and we were not satisfied with existing products as they are too bulky, overcomplicated, too gimmicky, too expensive, and moreover it did not look stylish. 

 
How We Solved.
In the very beginning, our team brainstormed to improve an existing card case with more functions to protect the Apple Card containing sensitive Titanium.
Unlike other credit cards, Apple Card only has user name engraved on the card without any information typically written on a credit card. We assumed such minimalistic design was possible because the society is becoming cashless with more virtual transactions on digital platforms. A credit card is more of a symbolic medium of a lifestyle than a physical object with values. Therefore, our team agreed that a wallet no longer has the same meaning or value to users. After careful trend and culture research, our team came up with a bold idea of a credit card case as a wearable accessory.
Our design goals contained threefolds; subtle design that improves your daily life and reflects the change in society, material that is easy to manufacture and manipulate, and a wearable product that can be customized and fashionable.

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Can one use Mockapp to design directly on an iPhone or an iPad?</strong></p>
<p>I get this question A LOT. But when you think about it: Why would anyone ever want to perform something as important and precise as designing an app on the tiny screen of a mobile device and without the precision of a mouse or a trackpad? Designing an iPhone app requires a lot of control and precision as you position and customize lots of tiny user interface elements down to the pixel. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As glamorous and ironic as it would be, trying to design an iPhone app on an iPhone or even an iPad is a bad idea.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So I'm sorry to say that the simple answer is no. You'll need a Mac or a PC and </span>believe<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> me: you'll make much better iPhone apps that way!</span><br/></p>
<p><strong>Why design in Powerpoint or Keynote as opposed to Photoshop?</strong></p>
<p>2 simple reasons: (1) Everyone knows how to use Powerpoint or Keynote and (2) Even expert designers who use Photoshop all day can't use it efficiently enough to create app mockups. So they're having to use a mockup tool and then design in Photoshop. And since the <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">app design process is iterative in nature, they have to repeat this inefficient process many times to make necessary changes. With mockapp, you can mockup and design right in Powerpoint and Keynote and iterate your design faster and more efficiently.</span></p>
<p><strong>Is mockapp an application?</strong></p>
<p>No. mockapp is composed of template files that can be opened in Powerpoint and Keynote. No need to install any software.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Will it work on Mac and PC?</strong></strong></p>Yes. mockapp will work on either a Mac or a PC as long as you have Powerpoint or Keynote installed.<br/><p></p>
<p><strong>Can I also design iPad apps with mockapp or only iPhone apps?</strong></p>
<p>There is a version of mockapp available for iPad app design. It is quite good but is currently only available in non-retina resolution and it only includes iOS 5 UI elements (as opposed to iOS 7). You can buy it now at <a href=""http://mockapp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mockapp.com</a> and download it immediately if you wish but be aware it won't be of much use to design iOS 7 styled apps.</p>
<p><strong>Will mockapp create a finished app?</strong></p>
<p>No. mockapp is a design tool. Not a programming tool. Just like when designing an app in Photoshop, an app designed in mockapp still needs to be programmed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p></span></span></div>","Ever Had an App Idea?
Ever wish you could design it using tools you already know like Powerpoint or Keynote on your PC or your Mac? Mockapp 2.0 will enable you to do just that. No learning curve. No new software to install. Welcome to app design heaven!
 



Mockapp 2.0 Includes
- App Design Library file with all the iPhone's user interface elements (bars, buttons, etc.) that you can just copy and paste into your own app designs.
- App Canvas file that you paste your app's buttons, etc. into.
- App Icon Maker template to design your own app icon.






mockapp comes with 2 sets of templates, one for Microsoft Powerpoint and the other for Apple Keynote to satisfy PC and Mac users alike.

Huge Design Library

The library file includes a complete set of high-resolution, pixel-perfect iPhone user interface elements you can copy, paste into your app designs, customize, etc. 
It also teaches you when you should use each UI element and when not to use it all according to Apple's own guidelines.

The user interface elements you'll get include:

Bars (Status bars, Navigation bars, Toolbars, Tab bars)
Buttons
500 (!!!) icons
Alert messages
Map elements
Date and time pickers
Action sheets
Modal views
Keyboards
Backgrounds
etc.













500 Resizable iOS 7 Icons

All 500 icons will be provided in vector format which means they can be resized to ANY size and colored in any color. And in the unlikely case you can't find the icons you need, mockapp will put you in touch with the designer of this iOS 7 icon set so they can make you the custom icons you need.





Precise Replica of iOS 7

Each UI element has been drawn as a vector shape and colored manually by me to be an exact replica of its iOS original. You can for example rename the buttons, resize them, etc. And the only pre-requisite is that you are familiar with Powerpoint or Keynote.







Just Copy and Paste UI Elements

The mockapp canvas file is the high-resolution representation of an iPhone screen onto which you can paste UI elements to layout your design. Each screen can be designed on a separate slide and you can even use Powerpoint or Keynote's animation feature to create clickable hyperlinks and simulate navigation between slides.






App Icon Maker Template (Pro version only)
mockapp Pro will even include an App Icon Make template with many app icon backgrounds and foreground elements to choose from as well as Apple's new golden ratio grid system so you can properly place and size your icon graphics.






Completeness Guarantee
If you get mockapp 2.0 Pro, you'll even benefit from my 100% Completeness Guarantee: If you can't find a standard iOS 7 user interface element you need for your app design, I will make it and provide it to you at no extra charge!

</li>
<li>
<b>BATTERY</b>: <span><br/></span>You will need to charge Artemis overnight roughly once every 2 weeks. Your phone must also be operational to use Artemis.<br/>(We recommend purchasing an external <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H5EKRB6?psc=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">phone charger</a> to keep your phone topped up if it gets low.)<span><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>CONNECTIVITY</b>: <span><br/></span>As long as your phone has a working data connection (e.g. WIFI, GPRS, LTE, etc) then Artemis can communicate with the emergency response center<br/><span>(if a data connection is not present when an emergency request is received, then the app will store the request and try to send it when it reconnects.)</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>SUBSCRIPTION</b>: <span><br/></span>For most services, Artemis requires an affordable monthly subscription. This is used to pay for the security operations staff, other security infrastructure, and so that we don't have to charge you a large fee for accidental false alarms like other companies do. Plans will range from $1/mo to $19/mo depending on the support level (see Price List above). Artemis comes with a free full-coverage-subscription for the first 60 days. There is one subscription per/user and each Artemis module is personalized to that user and plan. Artemis will process emergency requests <i>without a subscription</i>, but reverts to email-based alerts to friends.</li>
<li>
<b>INTERNATIONAL COVERAGE</b>: LIMITED SUPPORT FOR NOW<span><br/></span><span>Currently our security operations partners can only cover verbal emergency requests that require fire/medical/police response if they are made in the USA. Travel within the USA is fully supported. At launch, international buyers (or international travelers with an international data plan) will be able to have Artemis send international text messages and alert emails to predefined contacts with current GPS location, audio recordings, and a request for help (depending on their subscription level). We are looking to expand police/fire/medical/security coverage to other countries in the future. (see the Price List above for International Plan pricing)</span>

<p>When our CEO Jeff Axup was assaulted in two separate instances while traveling, he got to thinking about what it would take to have <i>instant</i> access to help, as well as recorded evidence of what occurred. Currently, it is often the case that no one is alerted that a crime is taking place until <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_8Qy50eaUo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">long after it is over</a>. Frequently there is <a href=""http://www.katu.com/news/local/DA-No-doubt-incidents-occurred-but-not-enough-evidence-for-charges-258204331.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">little objective evidence</a> of what occurred during a crime, which allows the perpetrators to <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/death-realtor-beverly-carter-was-accident-suspect-says-n226256"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">spin whatever story they wish</a>. After talking with hundreds of women and men about their crime experiences, it was clear that something could be done to improve on existing 911 systems and help empower people. When we review the US national crime statistics below, they make us mad. When we talk with people from Columbia, Mexico, India and other countries they tell us similar stories about unacceptable levels of crime in their countries.</p>

<p>No one should have to live in a society where violent crime is this prevalent and where we have to be scared walking alone at night. We have chosen to channel our anger into making a piece of technology that is both beautiful and elegant while also helping to reduce the impact and prevalence of violent crime.

<div><ul>
<li>We have currently invested about $30,000 of our own funds (and our families) and significant time into this project. The Indiegogo campaign will give us enough to produce the product, but we will also need other funding sources in the future to continue operating the security infrastructure. We have already begun discussions with several angel and VC groups.</li>
<li>We are building a security product. You can't try to change the world without having some legal risk. It is possible that in the future we will face some legal action relating to recording audio of crimes or cases where requests fail due to any number of variables outside our control. We have brought on excellent legal council to help us navigate these issues. We are also partnering with an external security company that already handles emergency calls and will accept some of the liability associated with the Artemis service.</li>
<li>We are shipping physical products and some of our product components will be made overseas. There will almost certainly be delays in some parts of the production process. To mitigate this, we plan to manufacture and assemble as much of the product in the San Francisco Bay Area as possible and we will be working with a CM with a good reputation and strong ties to Asia.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

</div></div>","Quotes from some of the letters we have received since announcing Artemis:










If you encounter an emergency, simply tap the Artemis necklace 3 times. 

Artemis uses a wireless connection with your smart phone to send an emergency transmission to our private security agency which is available 24/7.
The necklace buzzes to confirm your request has been received. 
The security operator uses live audio from your necklace, coupled with GPS data and your personal profile to determine whether to contact police, fire or medical staff to help you. 
Artemis simultaneously sends a text message to your choice of loved ones with your current location and a  request for help. 








Canceling A Request
Artemis is difficult to trigger by accident, but if you change your mind you can cancel it via the Artemis smart phone app (see the FAQ for more detail).






Checking That Artemis is Connected
If you want to check if your Artemis module is connected to your phone and able to send emergency requests, simply pop it out of the necklace and flip it back and forth briefly to look for a green light.





You will have access to your audio recordings, location and motion data, which may be useful in potential legal proceedings. This data is immediately streamed to the cloud and stored securely for you. Here is the final design for the module:



Moving the Artemis Module to a New Piece of Jewelry
Just pop the module into the back of any Artemis-compatible jewelry. A magnet attaches it securely so you won't have to worry about losing it. The module contains all the intelligence of Artemis and it listens for your taps and requests help for you.

(We are continuing to decrease the size of the Artemis pendant and Module and a larger working prototype is shown in the picture.)

Charging Artemis is as simple as placing your necklace on a wireless charging pad once every 2 weeks before you go to bed. In the morning, pick it up and you're good to go.


Size
The pendant necklace is slightly larger than a quarter. The Artemis module which inserts into the back is slightly smaller in diameter than a quarter.




Note: The final design shown here is smaller than the larger prototypes shown in the videos.6





How Does Artemis Compare?











We need to have a subscription fee to cover the expense of having security operators standing by 24/7, maintaining our internal emergency response systems, and wirelessly updating your Artemis with new security features in the future.
Artemis will deliver emergency messages to pre-defined contacts via email if you do not have a subscription plan. International plans currently support SMS text messages or email only (See INTERNATIONAL COVERAGE section below). A plan with direct security operator response is $19/mo and is currently only available in the USA. Limited text-messaging plans are available for as little at $1/mo.






PHONES and OS: iPhone 4 or later supported- Dec 2015.Android supported - Jul 2016.


BATTERY: You will need to charge Artemis overnight roughly once every 2 weeks. Your phone must also be operational to use Artemis.(We recommend purchasing an external phone charger to keep your phone topped up if it gets low.)


CONNECTIVITY: As long as your phone has a working data connection (e.g. WIFI, GPRS, LTE, etc) then Artemis can communicate with the emergency response center(if a data connection is not present when an emergency request is received, then the app will store the request and try to send it when it reconnects.)


SUBSCRIPTION: For most services, Artemis requires an affordable monthly subscription. This is used to pay for the security operations staff, other security infrastructure, and so that we don't have to charge you a large fee for accidental false alarms like other companies do. Plans will range from $1/mo to $19/mo depending on the support level (see Price List above). Artemis comes with a free full-coverage-subscription for the first 60 days. There is one subscription per/user and each Artemis module is personalized to that user and plan. Artemis will process emergency requests without a subscription, but reverts to email-based alerts to friends.

INTERNATIONAL COVERAGE: LIMITED SUPPORT FOR NOWCurrently our security operations partners can only cover verbal emergency requests that require fire/medical/police response if they are made in the USA. Travel within the USA is fully supported. At launch, international buyers (or international travelers with an international data plan) will be able to have Artemis send international text messages and alert emails to predefined contacts with current GPS location, audio recordings, and a request for help (depending on their subscription level). We are looking to expand police/fire/medical/security coverage to other countries in the future. (see the Price List above for International Plan pricing)


AGE:Artemis is designed for active fashionable adults age 16-70. Other products such as Filip, LifeAlert and SmartStones are more suitable for children and for less-active seniors.




We are confident that we will be able to manufacture, deliver and support necklaces for all backers if we reach our $200,000 base goal. 
If we do not raise the $200,000 by December 12, then if you backed us, all of your money is automatically returned by Indiegogo at the end of the campaign.
Alternatively, if we reach funding milestones past 200k, then we will be able to provide additional perks to all customers (see chart).






Sense6 Design has four additional team members who contribute fashion, electrical engineering, social media, jewelry design, safety and business expertise. The founders have known each other for 7 years and have collaborated on two mobile startups previously.
Our team members are seasoned travelers who have experienced adventure, street crime, and worry over the safety of loved ones. We are passionate about making the world a safer place and we feel that wearable computing has a role in making that happen. We believe smart jewelry can simultaneously aid personal empowerment, beauty, and safety. Artemis is our first step towards living in a world free from the threat of personal violence.

The world is still a dangerous place. Regardless of whether you look at crime statistics (see below), read your local newspaper headlines, or simply talk to your friends about their crime experiences, it's clear that we don't live in a safe environment. While the longer term goals of improving education, opportunities and mutual-respect deserve support, they don't solve the problem of you having to walk home alone tonight. We think it is surprising that more of our advanced technology hasn't been designed for women, and to solve problems relevant to them.

40 Years of College Football's Sexual-Assault Problem


When our CEO Jeff Axup was assaulted in two separate instances while traveling, he got to thinking about what it would take to have instant access to help, as well as recorded evidence of what occurred. Currently, it is often the case that no one is alerted that a crime is taking place until long after it is over. Frequently there is little objective evidence of what occurred during a crime, which allows the perpetrators to spin whatever story they wish. After talking with hundreds of women and men about their crime experiences, it was clear that something could be done to improve on existing 911 systems and help empower people. When we review the US national crime statistics below, they make us mad. When we talk with people from Columbia, Mexico, India and other countries they tell us similar stories about unacceptable levels of crime in their countries.


No one should have to live in a society where violent crime is this prevalent and where we have to be scared walking alone at night. We have chosen to channel our anger into making a piece of technology that is both beautiful and elegant while also helping to reduce the impact and prevalence of violent crime. Please help us take a step towards making people safer by purchasing a necklace if you can, and telling your friends if they worry about the safety of their loved ones.




Customer research with over 600 women on topics ranging from safety concerns, features and jewelry styles.

350+ women are signed up to participate in our Beta Program. (Sign up here)
Completed our PCB and Electrical Engineering design and have 10 functioning prototypes. (These will get smaller.)

Currently evaluating offers from several potential private security firms with 20+ years of experience to respond to your calls.
We are interviewing several manufacturing firms (CMs) to see which is most equipped to handle production of our unique jewelry and electronics product. We have extensive experience with manufacturing electronics products from previous projects.
Finalized jewelry design and have a beautiful sterling-silver casted version in our hands.6 (see charging video above)

We have a working prototype of the iPhone app which communicates with the necklace and the security company.
We've put over a year of development effort into this project to bring it to the stage where we need your funding to move forward.




We have put a year of effort and $30,000 of our own money into researching and designing a product that will make a difference for people who feel unsafe and want extra protection. We have overcome several hurdles in determining how to make the device work and how to design it so that it will be regularly worn. Now we need a minimum of $200,000 in funds to begin manufacturing it.  If we don't raise the money then it is unlikely that the product will be made.



Producing high quality jewelry and micro-electronics is not inexpensive, and we want to get Artemis in the hands of thousands of people who need greater security. Now we need your help to get to the final stage.








Do you know any people who:


have jobs that place them in dangerous situations
are parents with daughters or college students
are night shift workers

regularly exercise outside by themselves

are living in an unsafe neighborhood
are journalists with an interest in personal safety


Please let them know that we need their help.You can use the Tell a Friend button on our web site and more information is available on our Press Page.



We have currently invested about $30,000 of our own funds (and our families) and significant time into this project. The Indiegogo campaign will give us enough to produce the product, but we will also need other funding sources in the future to continue operating the security infrastructure. We have already begun discussions with several angel and VC groups.
We are building a security product. You can't try to change the world without having some legal risk. It is possible that in the future we will face some legal action relating to recording audio of crimes or cases where requests fail due to any number of variables outside our control. We have brought on excellent legal council to help us navigate these issues. We are also partnering with an external security company that already handles emergency calls and will accept some of the liability associated with the Artemis service.
We are shipping physical products and some of our product components will be made overseas. There will almost certainly be delays in some parts of the production process. To mitigate this, we plan to manufacture and assemble as much of the product in the San Francisco Bay Area as possible and we will be working with a CM with a good reputation and strong ties to Asia.

Footnotes:1. Artemis jewelry currently only comes in a pendant style. We plan to rapidly begin producing other necklaces, bracelets and other jewelry styles when we have more funding. Help us reach 500k in funding to win a free running bracelet for all Artemis jewelry purchasers! If you are an established jewelry company that wants to produce a line of Artemis-friendly safety jewelry please contact us.
2. No charge for accidental requests. Emergency requests go directly to a private security operator, so the government won't bill you for accidental requests. Prank calls may results in fees so please Artemis responsibly.
3. See 'Is Artemis waterproof?' in the FAQ above.4. See 'Where can I use Artemis?' in the FAQ above.5. We have spoken to 911 staff. The GPS information they receive can be wildly inaccurate. We have a method of triangulating to greater accuracy and tracking you over time in case of a kidnapping, which is superior to what 911 uses. 911 also doesn't immediately notify your loved ones.6. We are continuing to shrink the size of the Artemis module and the pendant design surrounding it. The exact design may change slightly before we ship, probably to be slimmer.7. All necklaces (except for the Solid-Palladium version) are crafted with high quality plating in Sterling Silver, White Gold and Gold respectively. Each necklace will have a matching chain included with the pendant and the Artemis module.8. See 'REQUIREMENTS' section above.

<p>The Sept Mai is, above all, a matter of design. A smart return to the sources of industrial aesthetics from the middle of the 20th century. It displays a stylish, balanced, yet bold expression. The Sept Mai uses space as a guiding principle and offers a modern design with an assertive character: depth, emptiness, relief, space. Combined with subtle innovative details, its general appearance will satisfy the passionate collector as well as the amateur looking for a timeless and exclusive accessory.</p>

<h3>Bold Design.</h3>
<p>Nostalgic notes with contemporary elements make Neucarl The Sept Mai a must-have for any enthusiast. The Sept Mai is an exercise in design and an object that brings together some of my convictions.</p>
<ul>
<li>An exclusive design using zero catalog pieces.</li>
<li>Limited Editions - only 100 numbered pieces for each finish.</li>
<li>Lume layer as a special feature.</li>
<li>No stylistic or technical compromise.</li>
<li>A strong DNA.</li>

<p>The breathtaking design of The Sept Mai immediately catches the eye. Without over-played minimalism, The Sept Mai combines a smart streamlined design with a slender look. It's a bold mix of classic design codes and subtle contemporary influences. Beyond trends, far from fast-fashion, the unique aesthetic of The Sept Mai takes probably takes roots in the post-Bauhaus era, in the current Streamline Moderne, and concedes some retro-futuristic notes. </p>

<p>The first production of Streamline Moderne appeared shortly after the crisis of 1929. The Chrysler Building in New York illustrates the transition to the ""Art Deco"" movement, which it was attached to and began to fade in the 30s. In this sense, the Art Deco period is the mother of the current Streamline Moderne. It is because of its requirements of rational sobriety that the Streamline Moderne appeared. It added curves, dynamism, fluidity, aerodynamics, central elements of the design of The Sept Mai. Streamline Moderne became a brand new field, generated mainly by the ""New-Deal"": Industrial Design.</p>

<p>You may be one of those people who just want to get to the point. Here are the dimensions of The Sept Mai. The Sept Mai was not designed to please everyone but should fit correctly on all wrists, with appropriate sizing and good lug width.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594132547/vwri2282wygdsx3dcqod.png"" src=""""/></h3>

<p>Going further in the details, The Sept Mai has a rounded 316L stainless steel durable case measuring 41mm in diameter, for a total length of 45mm, and a lug width of 20mm. Large enough to show its details with ease and keeping the thinnest edges possible.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594132799/sz4eebycp2iw9nkzocl5.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Thin Case.</strong> Designed around the skinny mechanical hand-wound Sellita SW215-1 movement, its depth is a mere 10mm, 8.35mm excluding crystal.</p>

<p><strong>Luminescence •</strong> The Sept Mai unveils an easily readable, slightly concave, multi-layered dial that adds depth and accentuates the watch's three-dimensional grip. The inner layer is made entirely from Swiss Super-LumiNova BGW9. Stunning. The upper layer adopts a circular brushed steel finish, giving it a familiar industrial touch.</p>

<div>
<strong>Perfect reading and unparalleled refinement.</strong> Devoid of numbers, the dial has many subtle details, such as clear and easy-to-read indexes. Among the many subtleties of the design are the hollowed-out hands that perfectly meet the different indexes or the date window with special geometry designed to match the angle of the indexes, as you can see below.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594134145/s8enft1n8nyn5odtnftr.jpg"" src=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>Geometry. </strong>More generally, the geometric aesthetic is found in the design of the perfectly balanced three-thirds dial. The outer third, the widest, includes the hour markers playing with the curvature of the dial, oriented towards the central hour segments. On the inner third, the different indexes keep the rule of proportions. They are also turned towards the central third, reinforcing its importance. It divides space into 12 time segments and illustrates, in a way, the quest for time control.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594134451/lcnspxxo0g14iudsz8dt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Allow space. </strong>Unlike the dial, the profile of the sapphire crystal is convex, increasing the use of space. The glass is double curved (the front and back of the crystal are curved), so there is little distortion of the dial, even when viewed from an angle. From an aesthetic point of view, it follows the curve of the case for perfect fluidity. </p>
<p><strong>The back glass</strong> is also a sapphire crystal. Its generous opening of 27mm reveals the Sellita SW215-1 movement. The Neucarl “N” monogram is discreetly present to remind us that it belongs to the brand. No other decoration is used to keep the simple, almost rough, industrial aspect of the movement.</p>
<p><strong>The back case</strong> is engraved with all the traditional information about the components but also mentions the Edition and the Serial number – here, The number 1 of 100 in the Founders Edition</p>

<p>The quest for freedom is the key symbol of my design. Through The Sept Mai case, after months of development, a somewhat dreamlike vision takes shape. Being able to materialize this concept of freedom is something truly magical for me. I hope it make sense in your eyes and that you also feel the magic when you see it.</p>

<p>Talking about design and functionalism demonstrates the responsibility I feel to make solid but subtle technical choices to support the design, and not just ""make it pretty to sell"".</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594134703/wgbohvixrdyqtbiz0t7s.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>Among these choices, the Sellita SW215-1 is original. It is a hand-wound movement with a date complication. While most mechanical movements today are self-winding, with an integrated rotor, this is an old-fashioned movement, so to speak. The absence of a rotor also allows it to maintain a thin profile of only 10mm, and it could have even been 8.35mm if my aesthetic requirement had not focused on a perfect curve and therefore the use of a curved sapphire.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594134753/wgtlm640rjzjg4vvf7cn.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>If it were a vintage watch, you wouldn't be surprised to find a hand-wound movement, but it's an unusual choice for a new microbrand watch. It is, above all, a decision intended to provide an experience different to that of an automatic winding watch. In a more personal, sensory relationship, you operate your Neucarl The Sept Mai yourself every day you decide to wear it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594134786/vmv1t8gpgf4iwgb5qrxl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I choose this movement during the first moments of the drawing process, and it is the latter that evolves around the Sellita SW215-1. In this sense, the path followed is fundamentally different from embedding a movement in an already designed case or chosen from a supplier's catalog.</p>
<p><strong>About. </strong>The Sellita SW215-1 is the first cousin of the famous ETA caliber 2804-2, but with two additional jewels. Many reputable watch companies are using this movement as an alternative to the ETA mechanism due to it being more economical and readily available. It is striking notably for its slimness (only 3.35 mm with date and central sweep seconds), reliability, and robustness.</p>

<p>To give form to a vision. I trust the creative process to express myself, to create something of enduring value. Neucarl has a stylish design, one of a kind, driven by passion. Amateurs can turn away from huge corporations and mass-brands to enjoy independent watchmakers' original and affordable products.</p>

<p>I’m not obsessed with the stacking of technical superlatives which seems to be the case in popular advertising. If you’re here, you’re probably, like me, intolerant of cheap and mass-produced products made to please everyone, according to the fashion and trends now on Instagram.</p>
<p>This does not mean being snobbish and only buying high-ticket items. It means demonstrating our taste and quality standards by the things we buy or the projects we support. In other words, not to impress others or brag, but to express how much we love beautiful and story-driven items. Our favorites goods are a means of self-expression.</p>

<p>In these turbulent times, I believe in the need to shape our environment with these little positive emotions that we sometimes feel, failing to control what escapes us. Like riding a bicycle, we must continuously reinvent how to keep our balance if we don’t want to fall.</p>
<p><strong>Expression through design is my own.</strong> My intention today is to offer a small piece of my space: a bold and modernist design with retro-futuristic accents. Initially influenced by the fascinating mid-century Streamline Moderne, it borrows from the past and the future to capture the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Capturing the moment is what we need.</strong> Let's do it together.</p>

<ul>
<li>Promote expression through design</li>
<li>Encourage entrepreneurship and help others succeed</li>
<li>Promote independent design rather than mass-market products.</li>

<p>Why Roma? Because for Neucarl, this is where it all started, five years ago already. If the date of May 7 is the first chapter in the history of Neucarl and gave its name to the brand's very first model, Roma is the theater. Steel, black, white. Nothing more, nothing less. Pure, simple, and honest as my relationship with Roma.</p>

<p>Beyond the technical features, what you get compared to a mass-market brand is the exclusiveness of a model produced from a limited series. Add in the little extra soul brought by the microbrand, and you have something worth supporting. This is something the marketing department of big brands can't manufacture.</p>

<p>I firmly believe in the crowdfunding and pre-order development model. The objective is to make Neucarl as independent as possible, so that its prosperity rests, above all, with its community of ambassadors. The first production is largely financed by its customers from the start. It’s a healthy choice that aims to build much more than a commercial relationship; it’s a relationship of mutual trust, almost like a family.</p>
<p>This is a business management choice, which makes it possible to get rid of bank financing and to be able to create independently. It allows Neucarl to limit stocks as much as possible, to produce on-demand, and therefore to offer you The Sept Mai in small series. This business model is made possible thanks to you since we’re in direct contact with you. There are no intermediaries. This allows a quality service in direct contact with you. </p>
<p><strong>Neucarl can envision sustainable development</strong> in the long term, without making you pay the high price for pages of advertising in magazines or fancy marketing. While some companies have to finance themselves from x6 to x8 or more, and often use bank financing, I choose independence, transparency, reason, sobriety, and security.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594199168/t4s1pcfygbyauxelt1lm.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Among the first to support Neucarl</strong>, a small group of unconditional supporters relied on the attention to detail brought to the Neucarl design. I call them ""Ambassadors"". I hope you took the time to read their testimonials – in a grey box – scroll up if you didn't!</p>
<p>They bought into my humble convictions very early on. They believe in the company's aim to deliver a quality proposition in the current design landscape. The best part is they choose to support the more profound mission carried by Neucarl: sharing positive emotions in the broad sense, through design.</p>
<p><strong>They are located in 18 different countries</strong> all around the world, waiting for the arrival of their Neucarl The Sept Mai, which has already been paid for, often months in advance. Still, they would not have given up their place to anyone, nor would they think about abandoning the project.</p>
<p>I can't cite everyone here, but thanks to you Allen, Luca, Oscar, John, Kevin, Aurélien, Guillaume, Peter, Gérard, Noah... to name only a few. Your support is priceless to me.</p>
<p>In this sense, Neucarl's bet would already have been won: </p>

</div></div>","The Sept Mai is, above all, a matter of design. A smart return to the sources of industrial aesthetics from the middle of the 20th century. It displays a stylish, balanced, yet bold expression. The Sept Mai uses space as a guiding principle and offers a modern design with an assertive character: depth, emptiness, relief, space. Combined with subtle innovative details, its general appearance will satisfy the passionate collector as well as the amateur looking for a timeless and exclusive accessory.


 
Bold Design.
Nostalgic notes with contemporary elements make Neucarl The Sept Mai a must-have for any enthusiast. The Sept Mai is an exercise in design and an object that brings together some of my convictions.

An exclusive design using zero catalog pieces.
Limited Editions - only 100 numbered pieces for each finish.
Lume layer as a special feature.
No stylistic or technical compromise.
A strong DNA.

 

 
 

 
 

The breathtaking design of The Sept Mai immediately catches the eye. Without over-played minimalism, The Sept Mai combines a smart streamlined design with a slender look. It's a bold mix of classic design codes and subtle contemporary influences. Beyond trends, far from fast-fashion, the unique aesthetic of The Sept Mai takes probably takes roots in the post-Bauhaus era, in the current Streamline Moderne, and concedes some retro-futuristic notes. 

The first production of Streamline Moderne appeared shortly after the crisis of 1929. The Chrysler Building in New York illustrates the transition to the ""Art Deco"" movement, which it was attached to and began to fade in the 30s. In this sense, the Art Deco period is the mother of the current Streamline Moderne. It is because of its requirements of rational sobriety that the Streamline Moderne appeared. It added curves, dynamism, fluidity, aerodynamics, central elements of the design of The Sept Mai. Streamline Moderne became a brand new field, generated mainly by the ""New-Deal"": Industrial Design.
 
 

You may be one of those people who just want to get to the point. Here are the dimensions of The Sept Mai. The Sept Mai was not designed to please everyone but should fit correctly on all wrists, with appropriate sizing and good lug width.


Going further in the details, The Sept Mai has a rounded 316L stainless steel durable case measuring 41mm in diameter, for a total length of 45mm, and a lug width of 20mm. Large enough to show its details with ease and keeping the thinnest edges possible.

 
Thin Case. Designed around the skinny mechanical hand-wound Sellita SW215-1 movement, its depth is a mere 10mm, 8.35mm excluding crystal.

 
 
Luminescence • The Sept Mai unveils an easily readable, slightly concave, multi-layered dial that adds depth and accentuates the watch's three-dimensional grip. The inner layer is made entirely from Swiss Super-LumiNova BGW9. Stunning. The upper layer adopts a circular brushed steel finish, giving it a familiar industrial touch.

 
 

Perfect reading and unparalleled refinement. Devoid of numbers, the dial has many subtle details, such as clear and easy-to-read indexes. Among the many subtleties of the design are the hollowed-out hands that perfectly meet the different indexes or the date window with special geometry designed to match the angle of the indexes, as you can see below.
 

 
 
Geometry. More generally, the geometric aesthetic is found in the design of the perfectly balanced three-thirds dial. The outer third, the widest, includes the hour markers playing with the curvature of the dial, oriented towards the central hour segments. On the inner third, the different indexes keep the rule of proportions. They are also turned towards the central third, reinforcing its importance. It divides space into 12 time segments and illustrates, in a way, the quest for time control.

Allow space. Unlike the dial, the profile of the sapphire crystal is convex, increasing the use of space. The glass is double curved (the front and back of the crystal are curved), so there is little distortion of the dial, even when viewed from an angle. From an aesthetic point of view, it follows the curve of the case for perfect fluidity. 
The back glass is also a sapphire crystal. Its generous opening of 27mm reveals the Sellita SW215-1 movement. The Neucarl “N” monogram is discreetly present to remind us that it belongs to the brand. No other decoration is used to keep the simple, almost rough, industrial aspect of the movement.
The back case is engraved with all the traditional information about the components but also mentions the Edition and the Serial number – here, The number 1 of 100 in the Founders Edition

 
 


The quest for freedom is the key symbol of my design. Through The Sept Mai case, after months of development, a somewhat dreamlike vision takes shape. Being able to materialize this concept of freedom is something truly magical for me. I hope it make sense in your eyes and that you also feel the magic when you see it.

Talking about design and functionalism demonstrates the responsibility I feel to make solid but subtle technical choices to support the design, and not just ""make it pretty to sell"".

Among these choices, the Sellita SW215-1 is original. It is a hand-wound movement with a date complication. While most mechanical movements today are self-winding, with an integrated rotor, this is an old-fashioned movement, so to speak. The absence of a rotor also allows it to maintain a thin profile of only 10mm, and it could have even been 8.35mm if my aesthetic requirement had not focused on a perfect curve and therefore the use of a curved sapphire.

If it were a vintage watch, you wouldn't be surprised to find a hand-wound movement, but it's an unusual choice for a new microbrand watch. It is, above all, a decision intended to provide an experience different to that of an automatic winding watch. In a more personal, sensory relationship, you operate your Neucarl The Sept Mai yourself every day you decide to wear it.
 

I choose this movement during the first moments of the drawing process, and it is the latter that evolves around the Sellita SW215-1. In this sense, the path followed is fundamentally different from embedding a movement in an already designed case or chosen from a supplier's catalog.
About. The Sellita SW215-1 is the first cousin of the famous ETA caliber 2804-2, but with two additional jewels. Many reputable watch companies are using this movement as an alternative to the ETA mechanism due to it being more economical and readily available. It is striking notably for its slimness (only 3.35 mm with date and central sweep seconds), reliability, and robustness.

Founders Edition




 

Neucarl suggests elegant, high-quality, unique designs, in small series, sold at a fair price. The brand inspires and shares positive emotions through unique and striking designs.
To give form to a vision. I trust the creative process to express myself, to create something of enduring value. Neucarl has a stylish design, one of a kind, driven by passion. Amateurs can turn away from huge corporations and mass-brands to enjoy independent watchmakers' original and affordable products.
 

I’m not obsessed with the stacking of technical superlatives which seems to be the case in popular advertising. If you’re here, you’re probably, like me, intolerant of cheap and mass-produced products made to please everyone, according to the fashion and trends now on Instagram.
This does not mean being snobbish and only buying high-ticket items. It means demonstrating our taste and quality standards by the things we buy or the projects we support. In other words, not to impress others or brag, but to express how much we love beautiful and story-driven items. Our favorites goods are a means of self-expression.

 

In these turbulent times, I believe in the need to shape our environment with these little positive emotions that we sometimes feel, failing to control what escapes us. Like riding a bicycle, we must continuously reinvent how to keep our balance if we don’t want to fall.
Expression through design is my own. My intention today is to offer a small piece of my space: a bold and modernist design with retro-futuristic accents. Initially influenced by the fascinating mid-century Streamline Moderne, it borrows from the past and the future to capture the moment.
Capturing the moment is what we need. Let's do it together.

 
Aesthetics and beautiful design, in general, fascinate me. Product design allows me to share a sensitivity for the simplicity of moments of intense pleasure. I also discovered that it is through Product Design that my most potent convictions come forward. It goes without saying that I am committed to defending them thanks to Neucarl.

Promote expression through design
Encourage entrepreneurship and help others succeed
Promote independent design rather than mass-market products.

All throughout the past 12 months, my company and I have developed a keen self-awareness and the skills needed to lead the projects that support Neucarl's long-term vision.
 

 
Founders Edition.
This represents the starting point of Neucarl. An edition oriented towards industrial aesthetics, symbolized by its circular brushed steel dial, which includes a lower layer made of Super-LumiNova BGW9 with a superb bluish glow.
Limited to 100 copies, this finish will only be produced once, do not miss it. You might be able to say show it proudly, in a few years: ""Yes, I was there!"" :)

Roma Edition 
Why Roma? Because for Neucarl, this is where it all started, five years ago already. If the date of May 7 is the first chapter in the history of Neucarl and gave its name to the brand's very first model, Roma is the theater. Steel, black, white. Nothing more, nothing less. Pure, simple, and honest as my relationship with Roma.

Berlin Edition
Why Berlin? I fell in love with Berlin in the year 2000, while covering for french medias the Film Festival which takes place every year in the German capital, 
The warmth of the people, the post-cold war atmosphere only 10 years after the reunification of east and west, the growth of this city in complete reinvention still inspires me.
On the occasion of a pleasure trip two years ago, I felt quickly at ease there. Carried by the artistic and cultural life of the places, I let myself imagine this unique dial. Retro-futuristic and bold, isn't it?

Beyond the technical features, what you get compared to a mass-market brand is the exclusiveness of a model produced from a limited series. Add in the little extra soul brought by the microbrand, and you have something worth supporting. This is something the marketing department of big brands can't manufacture.
 

I firmly believe in the crowdfunding and pre-order development model. The objective is to make Neucarl as independent as possible, so that its prosperity rests, above all, with its community of ambassadors. The first production is largely financed by its customers from the start. It’s a healthy choice that aims to build much more than a commercial relationship; it’s a relationship of mutual trust, almost like a family.
This is a business management choice, which makes it possible to get rid of bank financing and to be able to create independently. It allows Neucarl to limit stocks as much as possible, to produce on-demand, and therefore to offer you The Sept Mai in small series. This business model is made possible thanks to you since we’re in direct contact with you. There are no intermediaries. This allows a quality service in direct contact with you. 
Neucarl can envision sustainable development in the long term, without making you pay the high price for pages of advertising in magazines or fancy marketing. While some companies have to finance themselves from x6 to x8 or more, and often use bank financing, I choose independence, transparency, reason, sobriety, and security.

 

Among the first to support Neucarl, a small group of unconditional supporters relied on the attention to detail brought to the Neucarl design. I call them ""Ambassadors"". I hope you took the time to read their testimonials – in a grey box – scroll up if you didn't!
They bought into my humble convictions very early on. They believe in the company's aim to deliver a quality proposition in the current design landscape. The best part is they choose to support the more profound mission carried by Neucarl: sharing positive emotions in the broad sense, through design.
They are located in 18 different countries all around the world, waiting for the arrival of their Neucarl The Sept Mai, which has already been paid for, often months in advance. Still, they would not have given up their place to anyone, nor would they think about abandoning the project.
I can't cite everyone here, but thanks to you Allen, Luca, Oscar, John, Kevin, Aurélien, Guillaume, Peter, Gérard, Noah... to name only a few. Your support is priceless to me.
In this sense, Neucarl's bet would already have been won: 
To share positive emotions around a design project!

What started as a simple garment has become classics by now. Yemenis and espadrilles are timeless shoe styles. They are versatile, casual, and comfortable. We wanted to create harmony between these two styles.  We wanted to bring east and west together. So we combined these two classics and created fully handmade, fully customizable three unique shoe models inspired by timeless classics, yemenis and espadrilles. Paris, Zeugma and Barcelona. These Neva shoe models are the most authentic shoes of their kind in the world.  Also, we added some innovation to these classics. We covered outsole with organic natural rubber to prevent slippery and to reinforce and extend the life of the shoe.Nevas are unisex, easy to wear, easy to clean, comfortable and versatile shoes made with premium Italian leathers. We created Nevas and liked very much. We wear them literally every day. Now we want to share these models with you.We select basic colors for our models. Our artisans made samples with these basic colors and they are gorgeous. But we wanted that our backers reflect their individual styles to Nevas. So each backer can create their own unique shoe by selecting 3 models and 45 leather type and colors.Here are models. Paris is the first design of Neva Shoes. It offers one-piece upper and a short heel with extra soft leather anti-odor insole.Zeugma is the second design of Neva Shoes. It combines best features of espadrilles and yemenis with lowered tongue and lowered backstay. Also it has full flat organic rubber outsole add-on.Barcelona is the third design of Neva Shoes. It offers modern style with the best features of espadrilles and yemenis. It is improved with outsole version of one of our artisans old design. The designs are novel, but the materials (we used premium leathers imported from Italia when crafting samples and we will use premium materials with backer's shoes too. ) and craftsmanship are faithfully traditional.   Nevas are made to last with best quality Italian leathers, and you'll be surely be wearing yours for more than one season. They are fully handmade. The sides of the shoes are carefully hand stitched with %100 cotton thread dipped in beewax. The stitching is what gives Nevas their distinctive looks. Nevas are unisex, easy-to-wear, easy-to-clear, comfortable and versatile shoes.Here are the our selected basic colors Neva Shoe models.Or you can go with a custom pair of Neva to design your shoe inside and out. There are endless options, so you can create a unique pair to match your style. You can create your own unique shoe by selecting from 3 models and 45+ different color/leather option.We will send you a survey about your design at the end of the campaign, also with a link to design your shoe using our web site's online design tool, with our interactive custom neva design tool, you can see exactly what your shoe will look like as you select from an wide variety of options.    We will start to ship shoes 6 - 8 weeks after the end of the campaign. You can select your colors / leathers from our leather swatch . See our full detailed leather / color swatch from web site. If you want another color/ leather option for your shoe, please do not hesitate to contact us. We will contact our suppliers and will do our best to find your colors.  You will get a  beautifully made shoe with a multifunctional cotton dust bag in the box that's comfortable, surprisingly versatile, and well-nigh indestructible.  Neva's high-quality leathers soften with time and stretch to accommodate your feet, making them feel like a second skin that was stitched just for you.Hurry up and back this campaign earlier orders will be first on the production line.Please choose your size from the chart.Neva shoes are all made by natural leather that will adapt to your feet, in the case of being doubtful we recommend to choose the lowest number since the shoe will expand to adapt your feet. One of our co-founders is from Gaziantep, a town known with ancient shoemaking tradition. We meet with yemenis during our Gaziantep trip in 2017. We found this shoe style and yemeni artisan's craftsmanship is remarkable. I was wearing a pair of handmade espadrille at that time. We were impressed by the survival of these traditional models and crafting methods for hundreds of years.At that time, yemeni artisans we met were faced with economic and cultural crisis. We loved this traditional footwear. We wanted these traditions, and artisans to be saved from the wheel of times.We decided to create a leather shoe design as our first product when founding Neva Design. We wanted to create harmony between classic yemeni and espadrille styles.  We wanted to bring east and west together. Our goal is to make these models followers of tradition with sharing them with you, allowing people to appreciate the work from espadrille and yemeni craftsmen. Encouraging these artisans to embrace and pass their knowledge to following generations. Meet Orhan Bayram, he is our lead artisan.We combined these two classics and created three shoe models inspired by yemenis and espadrilles. And named them Paris, Zeugma and Barcelona ( To be honest Barcelona is an improved version of one of our lead artisan Orhan's old designs ).  Our production is currently in Gaziantep where local artisans still devote themselves to every single detail of every pair of classic shoe they produce. We’ve partnered with an artisan family which crafting yemenis with traditional ways for generations. We are using imported first quality Italian leathers. Every pair is still made entirely by hand, from A to Z, using high-quality leathers. Quality is matter,  each pair is meticulously hand-stitched using the same tools and methods that have been employed for generations. Slow, handcrafted production enables us to go carefully about our craft. We closely inspect each shoe to ensure that it meets our standards of beauty as well as durability before sending a pair to you. We made Nevas, wear them, and they are great. Now we want to share these designs with you too.We are an interesting mix of designers, graphic artists, software developers, and serial entrepreneurs.

Its quick-drying hydrophobic fibers absorb less than 1% of their weight in water.  Up To 7 Hours Battery LifeUsing the latest technology the Antelife G1 features radiant core heating technology and rechargeable 7.4V lithium-ion batteries the gloves are designed to deliver heat for up to 7 hours!  Slim rechargeable li-ion battery packs slip into pockets in the wrist of the gloves. The battery is installed in the storage bag at the wrist position of the gloves and can be taken out at any time, which is convenient for carrying and charging. In addition, the storage bag is designed with a waterproof zipper to prevent water ingress.Waterproof, Windproof and BreathableAntelife G1 gloves are designed to keep you comfortable and ready for whatever life throws at you, in any cold climate situation. Our gloves are made of a blend of taslan waterproof material and resin cotton making them: soft, light, breathable, windproof and water resistant.Machine WashableYou do not have to disturb yourself about the method of washing that would preserve the lifespan of your gloves. Simply take the batteries out and throw the gloves in the machine and you are good to go，just don’t forget to take out the batteries.Feel Free To Operate Your Smart PhoneIf you are going to make gloves that are adaptable to both regular city life and extreme adventures, the least you could do is make them touchscreen-friendly.   with the special durable touchscreen sensitive material that Antelife G1 ensure you can operate your mobile phones while the glove is on.     One More ThingWe never expected the amount of support we would have for our project, but we are so proud to recommend one more great product to make you feel great this winter...

<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<p>Elppy's housing is made of polycarbonate and the band is made of a durable elastomer similar to that used in many sports watches.</p>
<p>Inside, is where all the magic happens - with smart technology, Elppy™ uses as little as possible energy for endless uses. Here's an exploded view of the different parts.</p>

<div style=""text-align: left;"">Elppy™ comes with an adjustable finger strap that accommodates fingers with range of diameters from 13 to 25 mm (circumference from 40.8 to 78.5mm). If this size range does not suit you, please contact us on <a href=""mailto:support@elppy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@elppy.com</a> &amp; we will endeavour to change the sizes based on customer demand. <div>

Elppy's highly durable housing is resilient and scratch, bump, water and drop resistant! With normal daily use, Elppy™ lasts up to two years.

<p>Elppy™ is a Bluetooth Low Energy human interface device (HID) that is natively supported by a wide range of devices and operating systems. Make sure the device you wish to control supports Bluetooth low energy and HID devices before attempting to pair.</p>
<p>If Elppy™ is not paired with any device, pressing any of the two buttons will wake Elppy™ up into pairing mode. This is indicated by a quick flash of the LED.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> Elppy™ will remain in Pairing or Discoverable mode for 30 seconds, after which it moves to sleep mode and the process will need to be repeated.</span></p>
<p>After 10 mins of inactivity, Elppy™ takes a nap to conserve energy. You can wake it up by pressing any of the two buttons. To control Elppy™ you use one of 5 actions all performed with your finger/thumb: swiping the touch pad left, right, upwards or downwards (nice long strokes) or briefly touching the centre of the pad.  </p>

Elppy™ works by simply pairing it to your smart device via Bluetooth and controlling functions using the touchpad that has been fashioned to be worn on the finger. You can control your music, take photos or even give presentations all controlled remotely with Elppy™, straight out of the box, with no apps!
Once Elppy™ is out there and in the hands of app developers, we believe that the applications for Elppy™ are endless. We'll provide app developers the tools to create apps that give Elppy™ additional features like controlling TVs, lights, doors and the list goes on...

Elppy™ will simplify the way you use your devices forever. Unfortunately, we have had reported issues with purchasing perks from our campaign. One of the main causes has been the auto-fill function of internet browsers. If this occurs, try manually filling in your details.  If the problem persists or you have any other payment issues, please don't hesitate to contact us on support@elppy.com and we'll try to resolve this issue with  Indiegogo support. Thanks for supporting us!








It's the smart ring which NEVER needs recharging, and doesn't require any special app to make it work! In fact, Elppy™ can be paired with any device using Bluetooth technology which means the sky's the limits in terms of uses! 
Light and compact, Elppy™ is the friend on your fingertips, allowing you to skip music effortlessly while exercising without stopping your activity. For professionals, it can be used to skip through a slide presentation without having to point and click! 













Over the last 18 months we have busy designing and building functional prototypes and evaluating them. As seen in our video footage, the functional prototype (left of image below) has been successfully used in many applications. However, after user feedback we have further improved our design (right of image below), in many different ways! The new production design is what you'll be receiving & what we need your help with to make happen!



 

To see our functional prototype in action, here are some ""how-to"" videos:  How to use Elppy (prototype).

Elppy's housing is made of polycarbonate and the band is made of a durable elastomer similar to that used in many sports watches.
Inside, is where all the magic happens - with smart technology, Elppy™ uses as little as possible energy for endless uses. Here's an exploded view of the different parts.









Elppy™ comes with an adjustable finger strap that accommodates fingers with range of diameters from 13 to 25 mm (circumference from 40.8 to 78.5mm). If this size range does not suit you, please contact us on support@elppy.com & we will endeavour to change the sizes based on customer demand. 
What sets Elppy™ apart from other smart rings is that it's so simple to connect and start using and yet is a fraction of the price of it's predecessors.
Competitor units require complex apps to function. Elppy™ on the other hand is simple to connect and use. Made with lightweight elastomer, Elppy™ sits comfortably on your finger, resilient to sweat and safe from slipping during even the most vigorous activity. 




We've thoroughly tested Elppy™ with a variety of uses! Elppy's highly durable housing is resilient and scratch, bump, water and drop resistant! With normal daily use, Elppy™ lasts up to two years. At a disposable price point, Elppy™ is designed as a throwaway when the in-built battery is depleted - allowing you to upgrade to the latest technology/model. 
Elppy™ is compatible with Windows, OS X, Android and iOS devices and have reported no compatibility issues. 

Elppy™ is a Bluetooth Low Energy human interface device (HID) that is natively supported by a wide range of devices and operating systems. Make sure the device you wish to control supports Bluetooth low energy and HID devices before attempting to pair.
If Elppy™ is not paired with any device, pressing any of the two buttons will wake Elppy™ up into pairing mode. This is indicated by a quick flash of the LED. Elppy™ will remain in Pairing or Discoverable mode for 30 seconds, after which it moves to sleep mode and the process will need to be repeated.
After 10 mins of inactivity, Elppy™ takes a nap to conserve energy. You can wake it up by pressing any of the two buttons. To control Elppy™ you use one of 5 actions all performed with your finger/thumb: swiping the touch pad left, right, upwards or downwards (nice long strokes) or briefly touching the centre of the pad.  





Elppy™ operates in two different modes: 
1. Multimedia/Selfie mode (single LED flash) or 
2. Presentation mode (double LED flash). 
Each mode can be selected selected by pressing a button (top button for multimedia, bottom button for presentation). The change of mode is indicated by a single or double flash of the LED upon button release.








MULTIMEDIA/SELFIE MODE (single LED flash) 
Allows the user to pause/play, change tracks and adjust the volume. When the native camera app is open, you can trigger a shot!
Swipe right - advances to the next track. 
Swipe left - returns you to the start of the current track or to the previous track if two swipes are performed in quick succession. 
Swipe up - increases the volume or triggers the camera when in the native camera app.
Swipe down - decreases the volume or triggers the camera when in the native camera app. 
A momentary touch of the centre of the pad - will pause/play the current track. 
PRESENTATION MODE (double LED flash) 
This mode allows Android, PC or Mac users to navigate their device or presentation slides. *NB this mode non functional on iOS devices. 
Swipe right - moves the selection to the right, or advances the slide.
Swipe left - moves the selection to the left or takes you to the previous slide. 
Swipe up - moves the selection upwards 
Swipe down - moves the selection downwards. 
A momentary touch of the centre of the pad - will ""enter"" the currently selected item.







Postage of Elppy™ is estimated to be $5USD to Australia and $10USD to the rest of the world. The postage cost is the same for all perks (except retail pack), so you can bundle multiple Elppy's for the same postage!


Elppy™ will be produced in Black, Blue & Green but new colors will be introduced if stretch goals can be met. 
COLOR SELECTION:
For all rewards that offer backer-selected colors, backers will be able to make their color choices via a separate survey that we'll send around at the end of the campaign.


$80,000: MORE COLORS TO SELECT FROM!
If we manage to raise $80K, we'll be adding three additional colors selections, including rose gold, for your Elppy™!
$100,000: WATER RESISTANT!
If we manage to raise $100K, we'll make sure the casing is water resistant, so you don't have to worry about any accidents!
Our current design is fairly water resistant, but we cant guarantee it (mainly around the buttons). If we achieve this stretch goal, we'll be able to add a manufacturing process that will guarantee water resistance.
$150,000: SECRET STRETCH GOAL!
If we manage to raise $150K, we'll be introducing a secret stretch goal! We can't tell you all the details just yet, but we can tell you it will be a celebration you won't want to miss;) Keep an eye on our updates for the secret stretch goal announcement!

</div></div>","The world is full of beautifully unique places, systems and beings, however many of them will soon be gone forever. 

 
Massive coral bleaching all around the Great Barrier Reef, Japanese dolphins are being brutally slaughtered as we speak. The Solomon islands are being taken over and ruined for logging.  Caribbean reefs are being altered by man-introduced fish that have already dropped certain reef fish populations by 90%! and of course the countless islands and countries such as the Tuvalu, Kiribati, Barbados, Philippines, Bangladesh, Egypt, Maldives and so many more homes to millions of people will soon be under water. 
 

 
We believe in the human race. Throughout our existence we have been able to repeatedly prove our ability to get things done and move forward. We also believe that we should not stop growing, not stop building and not stop creating because it is this innovation that has brought us so far, that has brought many of us healthy enjoyable lifestyles, however if we wish to continue on this great journey and share it with others then we have to be more efficient and we need to live smart.
 
It may not be one trick that fixes our climate and balances out our globe, but there are enough small things we can do to make a huge impact together.

This is one of our plans, and hopefully you can help:
 

 
To do our part in keeping our planet clean and sustainable we have created the SEAVAL Shades, made sturdy out of the most sustainable material to grow from our soil today, bamboo. The sunglasses come with top quality polarized lenses, great sense of style and comfort and to support extreme athletes and hands-on activists we made them durable, waterproof and they float!

 
Yes our sunglasses have more sustainable processes and materials than other brands, but that's not all we're doing to help. We have partnered with some of the best organizations and certainly our favorite, who have dedicated themselves to bettering our planet and solving global issues.

With each purchase of SEAVAL Shades you can help us donate to them at no additional charge. See the info below and help us help them help us all.  

For each pair of SEAVAL Shades, you help us donate $5 to the organization of your choice!
We are launching our new line of SEAVAL Shades in collaboration with some of the best, and definitley our favorite, wildlife conservation organizations. With each purchase of Shades you make, we will donate $5 to the organization of your choice! See the organizations below and pledge for a pair of SEAVAL Shades on the option labeled with their name.

Ric O’Barry’s Dolphin Project is a campaign under the International Marine Mammal Project at the non-profit Earth Island Institute. The Dolphin Project aims to stop dolphin slaughter and exploitation around the world.  This work has been chronicled in films such as the Oscar-winning documentary The Cove, A Fall From Freedom, and in the Animal Planet mini-series Blood Dolphin$. Campaigns for dolphin protection are currently underway in a variety of locations around the globe, including, Indonesia, Faroes Islands, Solomon Islands and India.  For more information and options to support Ric and the dolphins, please click the image below and visit www.dolphinproject.org

Although a beautiful creature, the lionfish has been a major threat to the many waters and reefs it has recently invaded. Due to an aquarium release in Florida the lionfish found itself in a surrounding with no natural predators and everything to eat. This allowed the Pterois volitans to roam freely and spread out in massive numbers across the Caribbean, Southern United States, Central America and parts of South America in no time.The lionfish can lay over 30,000 eggs every 4 days, is protected by long venomous spines, eats over 3 times its body weight daily, have dropped certain reef fish populations by over 90% already and are responsible for immense amounts of coral damage!Lionfish Elimination Team is the leading reaction organization dedicated to safely and efficiently removing lionfish from the invaded waters.

<p>With your help we would like to bring this technology to all.<br/></p>
<span><span> This project starts from year expert that we could do in the field of direct printing on textile, we started several years ago, with basic models and then move on to ever more efficient models and competitive.<br/><br/> All this is great but we want to do more, to give the opportunity to many to enter this wonderful <span>World</span> of textile printing and personalization.<br/><br/> On the current market there are other printers of this kind, each one with pros and cons, but all with high prices.<br/> We want to create a product that brings together all the positive things but at a reasonable price and the only way to </span><span>achieve this is to make it happen together.</span><br/><br/><p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445940671/ahggevycykb94gt44nda.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span><span>The <b>Butterfly v3</b> is an inkjet printer for direct printing on textile, with this you can customize various kinds of garments, such as T-shirts, polo shirts, sweatshirts, leotards, aprons, table cloths, shoes, caps, etc.<br/> This technique is essential to coat that slice of the market where the traditional screen printing can not be of help, such as small productions or complex graphics in full color, where the cost of the frames would be too high.<br/><br/> With this printer you can start a business right away, just add your creativity and the result is secured.</span><br/></span></p>
<p><span><span>This</span> is a machine with many positive features.</span></p>
<p><span> The main ones are:<br/> - Loading system ink bags to ensure optimum conservation<br/> - Recirculation of white ink to prevent separation and sedimentation<br/> - System ""WetCap system"" to keep the head always damp even in stand-by<br/> - Automatic cleaning system<br/> - Integrated PC<br/> - Touch screen<br/> - Rapid platen system<br/> - Very high resolution and fast printing<br/> - Printing area of some 30 x 50 cm (11.8 x 19.7 in)</span><br/></p>

<span><span>Textile ink is not toxic, it is water-based and subject to evaporation.<br/> To ensure excellent preservation we decided to adopt a system of bags, easily replaceable and no chip control.<br/><br/> You will be free to use the ink of your choice.<br/><br/> We are many years studying and improving our ink and arrived in good results.<br/> Our ink has a formulation that can realize prints lives and resistant to washing with a minimal maintenance requirement.</span></span><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446040286/sylnchbyat3oukjnkn0x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<span>As everyone now knows, the white ink is what can cause problems if not managed well.<br/> In Butterfly v3 there will be a system of recirculation and filtration so as to keep the ink in excellent condition and ready for printing.</span><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445953225/bzyat77xzktafnyrbbtp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<span>A leading cause of clogging of the print head is the air, to avoid this we have devised a ""WetCap System"" which, at the time of stand-by, pushing the cleaning liquid in the sponge where the head is supported so as to keep forever humid.</span><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445953255/rzei8qrperjbbmdmglzt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div></div>","With your help we would like to bring this technology to all.
 This project starts from year expert that we could do in the field of direct printing on textile, we started several years ago, with basic models and then move on to ever more efficient models and competitive. All this is great but we want to do more, to give the opportunity to many to enter this wonderful World of textile printing and personalization. On the current market there are other printers of this kind, each one with pros and cons, but all with high prices. We want to create a product that brings together all the positive things but at a reasonable price and the only way to achieve this is to make it happen together.

The Butterfly v3 is an inkjet printer for direct printing on textile, with this you can customize various kinds of garments, such as T-shirts, polo shirts, sweatshirts, leotards, aprons, table cloths, shoes, caps, etc. This technique is essential to coat that slice of the market where the traditional screen printing can not be of help, such as small productions or complex graphics in full color, where the cost of the frames would be too high. With this printer you can start a business right away, just add your creativity and the result is secured.
This is a machine with many positive features.
 The main ones are: - Loading system ink bags to ensure optimum conservation - Recirculation of white ink to prevent separation and sedimentation - System ""WetCap system"" to keep the head always damp even in stand-by - Automatic cleaning system - Integrated PC - Touch screen - Rapid platen system - Very high resolution and fast printing - Printing area of some 30 x 50 cm (11.8 x 19.7 in)




Textile ink is not toxic, it is water-based and subject to evaporation. To ensure excellent preservation we decided to adopt a system of bags, easily replaceable and no chip control. You will be free to use the ink of your choice. We are many years studying and improving our ink and arrived in good results. Our ink has a formulation that can realize prints lives and resistant to washing with a minimal maintenance requirement.

As everyone now knows, the white ink is what can cause problems if not managed well. In Butterfly v3 there will be a system of recirculation and filtration so as to keep the ink in excellent condition and ready for printing.

A leading cause of clogging of the print head is the air, to avoid this we have devised a ""WetCap System"" which, at the time of stand-by, pushing the cleaning liquid in the sponge where the head is supported so as to keep forever humid.

To keep the printer efficiently, we decided to integrate a system of cleaning and loading ink by electric pump. in this way it is possible to perform cleaning cycles or loading, in a clean and productive way.



These will be the main platen through which you can customize different things.



The Butterfly v3 will be equipped with a print head composed of 8 channels divided into 180 nozzles each one, all with technology ""Variable drop"" which allows to print three different drops ensuring optimum printing.







With this machine you can make high-quality prints with ease.
For printing garment clear, so no need to print a white base, is 
sufficient to load the image into the printer, select the margins and 
print settings, load the garment, press start and after dry with heat 
press or industrial oven.
As seen in the chart below, it is all very easy and fast.




For printing garment dark, then with the need to print a white base, simply pretreat the garment and load, load the image into the printer, select the margins and print settings with white base, press start and after dry with hot press or an industrial furnace. As seen in the chart below, it is all very easy and fast.




We thought of a campaign a bit 'special, 
promote a high quality product at an extremely low price.
 We are sure that thanks to you, our project will be constructed and that this technology will have an excellent momentum worldwide.












Below we want to show some pictures and videos of clothing printed with the sister Butterfly v2, this gives you an idea of how and what you can achieve with this technology.

<p> </p>
<p>Kara Beauty is a brand created for a degree project by Clarissa Devina Gunawan that has an aim to help women have a faster and simpler makeup routine. With the tagline ‘beauty made simple’, the brand provides multi-functional makeup products that are made from 100% natural ingredients. Targeting consumers that prefer simple and minimalist makeup, the brand also leverages two of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, gender equality and responsible consumption and production.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>What makes the products from the brand unique is that they are multifunctional makeup. All of Kara Beauty's products would not be specified for only one use. However, otherwise, each product will have more than one purpose, for example, a cream that people can use on their lips, cheek, and as an eyeshadow, or a pomade/rigorous cream that can be used for the eyebrow and as an eyeliner. Moreover, all of the brand products will also be made of 100% organic materials, where people will not have to worry about whether or not the product will damage their faces, as all-natural ingredients make them. Ethical working and low consumption and production are two things that make Kara Beauty unique as not all brands care about the environment.</p>

<p>This crowdfunding aims to bring Kara Beauty’s product to life, including creating packaging. All of the products will be made by marginalized women, who have hardship, such as single-parent women or women who experienced workplace harassment.</p>
<p>Kara Beauty plans to work together with Singaporean non-profit organization – AWARE if the goal of this crowdfunding is exceeded. The brand would also like to collaborate with AWARE to create the formula for the brand's 100% natural ingredients products. Therefore, by donating to this project, you will not only help Kara Beauty, but you will also help women in need. </p>

</div></div>","Kara Beauty is a cosmetics brand that has an aim to create beauty through simpler and easier ways. The products that the brand provides are multi-functional makeup with 100% natural ingredients.
 

 
'Beauty Made Simple'
 
 

 
Kara Beauty is a brand created for a degree project by Clarissa Devina Gunawan that has an aim to help women have a faster and simpler makeup routine. With the tagline ‘beauty made simple’, the brand provides multi-functional makeup products that are made from 100% natural ingredients. Targeting consumers that prefer simple and minimalist makeup, the brand also leverages two of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, gender equality and responsible consumption and production.
 
 

 
What makes the products from the brand unique is that they are multifunctional makeup. All of Kara Beauty's products would not be specified for only one use. However, otherwise, each product will have more than one purpose, for example, a cream that people can use on their lips, cheek, and as an eyeshadow, or a pomade/rigorous cream that can be used for the eyebrow and as an eyeliner. Moreover, all of the brand products will also be made of 100% organic materials, where people will not have to worry about whether or not the product will damage their faces, as all-natural ingredients make them. Ethical working and low consumption and production are two things that make Kara Beauty unique as not all brands care about the environment.
 
 

 


 
 

 
Our products are all made of 100% natural ingredients.


 
 

 
This crowdfunding aims to bring Kara Beauty’s product to life, including creating packaging. All of the products will be made by marginalized women, who have hardship, such as single-parent women or women who experienced workplace harassment.
Kara Beauty plans to work together with Singaporean non-profit organization – AWARE if the goal of this crowdfunding is exceeded. The brand would also like to collaborate with AWARE to create the formula for the brand's 100% natural ingredients products. Therefore, by donating to this project, you will not only help Kara Beauty, but you will also help women in need. 
 

 

 

 
To create the packaging includes a manufactured perspex compact case. Kara Beauty would need to order a minimum quantity of 12 000 pieces per design. The investment capital requires to meet the minimum order makes this a challenge.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Here at
Sneaks&amp;Swag we provide quality sneaker and boot customizations at an
affordable rate. Getting your sneakers or boots customized benefits you the
customer because you will feel that your customized or restored sneakers or
boots are cool and unique because they were made just for you. You the customer
would feel that their sneakers or boots are like brand new because they were
restored by us at Sneaks&amp;Swag. Our service is greatly needed because roughly
300 million pairs of sneakers are thrown away each year according to (</span><a href=""http://usagainblog.com/2013/05/17/the-shoe-waste-epidemic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">http://usagainblog.com/2013/05/17/the-shoe-waste-epidemic/</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">) because they don’t see the value in
them when there could be a huge value to them if you got them customized or restored
by us at Sneaks&amp;Swag.</span><br/></p>
<p>Competitive
Advantage</p>
<p>Our
advantage at Sneaks&amp;Swag is that our customizations are more original and
unique than other customizers. Another advantage is that our customizations are
faster to get back (1 month fastest 3 months longest) than other customizers
which take as long as 6 months. Furthermore your sneakers or boots do not have
to be in DS condition (dead stock or great condition) when you send them to us
unlike other customizers who require DS sneakers only. Finally we provide high
quality full sneaker and boot restorations which is something that other
customizers do not offer. </p>
<p>Competitors </p>
<p>Some of our
competitors are Kickstradomis, District customs, Dejesus customs, and Mache
customs. </p>
<p>Organization
and Management</p>
<p>The best
organization partners for Sneaks&amp;Swag are sneaker stores like: Nike, Adidas, Foot
Locker, Finish Line, and Kicks Usa. These stores are helpful because they are
major sneaker distributors. Angelus Direct would also be a great organization
because they are the best and only leather and suede paint and dye
distributors. Sneaks&amp;Swag uses Angelus Direct for all of its painting and
cleaning supplies. </p>
<p>Marketing
&amp; Sales</p>
<p>We plan to
market Sneaks&amp;Swag by using social media sites such as: Facebook, Instagram,
YouTube, Twitter, and Pinterest to spread the word about Sneaks&amp;Swag
customizations and restorations. Our sales strategy is to have our service
featured in popular sneaker distributor stores like: Nike, Adidas, Foot Locker,
Finish line, and Kicks Usa. Being featured in these stores is key because most
of our customers get their sneakers or boots from these stores.  </p>
<p>Financial
Projection</p>
<p>Our
Financial projection is that we will be receiving at least two sneaker or boot
customizations per week ($75). We also project to be doing at least 3 sneaker
or boot restorations per week ($50). We are projecting $125 per week which is a
total of $500 per month. We will be taking out -$75 per month on advertising
such as our website, social media, etc. We will be also taking out -$75 for
supplies such as paint brushes, paint, cleaners etc. We also will be taking out
-$50 for our hard working employees and we will be taking out -$75 for sneaker
shows or events. By the end of the month will be left with $225 for savings (If
anything goes wrong or needs to be fixed). We are projecting $6,000 in sales
this year. By the end of the year we will have $2,700 in savings money. </p><p><b>What We Need</b></p><p><b>Your donations will enable us to purchase customization materials that will keep our business afloat.</b></p>

<p>We've come up with an AI Integrated, feature filled solution that we believe is perfect for the everyday backpack user in the 21st century. The key points include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A personal assistant that communicates from the bag (AI)</li>
<li>A Data connection (either separate or connected to your phone) to keep you connected</li>
<li>A Mobile Hotspot and Wi-Fi Access using the above connection</li>
<li>An LED Inside the bag that turns on when bag is opened</li>
<li>A Personal Cloud System for files</li>
<li>A Companion app to customise preferences from your phone.</li>
<li>A CCTV-Style Camera, for the moments you wish you caught, or even in case of an accident.</li>
<li>Speakers! Take your music with you, and, share it with others.</li>
<li>A Solar Powered Battery pack! The bag never needs charged, so long as you use it!</li>
<li>A Tracking system using provided NFC Tags, meaning you will get an alert on your phone if you leave something behind!</li>
<li>An alarm is fitted, if the bag is moved out of range from the phone while connected, an alarm will sound, deterring any sticky fingers!</li>

<h3>Kurzbeschreibung</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>Seit 30 Jahren unterrichtet unsere gemeinnützige Kampagne freshFANTASY Kinder und Jugendliche auf 
Trendsportgeräten: Inlineskates, Einrädern, Waveboards, Snowboards, 
Heelys usw. - aber bei keinem dieser Geräte war die Begeisterung so groß, wie
 bei den SnakeSurfern. Nachdem es keinen Hersteller mehr gibt und den meisten Schulen das Geld zur 
Anschaffung dieser tollen Innovation fehlt, möchten wir es in hochwertiger Form selbst produzieren lassen und möglichst vielen Schulen und Sportvereinen auf Spendenbasis beschaffen. Deshalb besteht jedes Perk aus zwei (!) Sets SnakeSurfer: eines für Dich und ein weiteres, welches Du dann einer Schule oder

Seit 30 Jahren unterrichtet unsere gemeinnützige Kampagne freshFANTASY Kinder und Jugendliche auf 
Trendsportgeräten: Inlineskates, Einrädern, Waveboards, Snowboards, 
Heelys usw. - aber bei keinem dieser Geräte war die Begeisterung so groß, wie
 bei den SnakeSurfern. Nachdem es keinen Hersteller mehr gibt und den meisten Schulen das Geld zur 
Anschaffung dieser tollen Innovation fehlt, möchten wir es in hochwertiger Form selbst produzieren lassen und möglichst vielen Schulen und Sportvereinen auf Spendenbasis beschaffen. Deshalb besteht jedes Perk aus zwei (!) Sets SnakeSurfer: eines für Dich und ein weiteres, welches Du dann einer Schule oder
 einem Sportverein Deiner Wahl überreichst.
Um einen ersten Container ordern zu können, benötigen wir 900 Bestellungen.
