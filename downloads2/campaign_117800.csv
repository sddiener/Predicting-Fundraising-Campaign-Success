<p>My name is Katalin Galambos and I’ve been living in Norway for more than four years with my family consisting of two small kids. Both of my kids were born during our stay here and thus I have been lucky to experience Norway’s impressing family and child centric environment.</p>
<p><strong>Being a mum is an everyday challenge and even more in a new society with different cultural background.</strong>  In order to manage the daily operational issues with your children and settle in, you need to put much more effort in finding your way, than if you were a local.

<h3><strong>It began 3 years ago</strong></h3>
<p>Not being aware of any similar formation, after my first child was born I <strong>established an international mother group in Oslo</strong> (called IMOBAGO) to gather mums in similar situation and create a sharing and cooperation zone.</p>
<h3><strong>Road to the a book</strong></h3>
<p>Based on these mothers’ specific and custom-made questions, issues and best practices, I’ve identified the typical challenging areas for expat mothers in Oslo, grouped the relevant related information and now would like to make it available for an even larger group of mothers</p>

<h3><strong>Funds will cover the printing costs</strong></h3>
<p>The plan now is to have <strong>~200 printed copies</strong> during the first quarter of 2013 followed by an e-book later on. The size of the printed version would be A5 which is the optimal size that can easily fit into a hand bag and be always within reach on the go.</p>

<p>By contributing to this campaign, you will be helping to publish the largest, most jam-packed issue of <strong><a href=""http://www.incite-online.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">INCITE</a> </strong>to date, featuring over 250 pages of writing, art work, interviews, scholarly articles, technical resources, more than three dozen full color images, and contributions by more than 50 artists, filmmakers, writers, microcinema operators, programmers, archivists, and scholars from the U.S., Canada, and Europe. All funds will go toward the design and printing of the issue. You can view the Table of Contents for INCITE #4 online <a href=""http://www.incite-online.net/issuefour.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>here</strong></a>.<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>About the Issue:<br/></strong>With Amos Vogel's passing in April 2012, American film culture lost one of its most passionate and influential iconoclasts. INCITE #4, ""Exhibition Guide,"" pays tribute to Vogel's legacy, most notably Cinema 16, a precursor to the flourishing microcinema network of the 1990s and a forebear of today's freewheeling cinespaces. In the age of so-called ""participatory"" media, in which people connect virtually using avatars and aliases to stream data on handheld devices, what binds these social cinematic sites, and makes them flourish? </p>
<p><span>While vertically mapping microcinemas of past and present, this issue also surveys the breadth of alternative media exhibition practice, from Dziga Vertov's agit-train and Bill Brand's metro <em>Masstransiscope</em>, to artists who use film without projectors and projectors without film. INCITE #</span>4 seeks to engage the history of unconventional cinemas by zeroing in on those puzzle pieces that don't quite fit. Lost-and-found in the couch cushions and idiosyncratically dog-eared, these are the components of itinerant and expanded cinema practices that don't take place inside four-walled cinema chambers, on screens, online or, even, in a projector fashion. Hopefully, these aberrations will spur readers to reconsider the whole gambit of moving image exhibition.</p>

By contributing to this campaign, you will be helping to publish the largest, most jam-packed issue of INCITE to date, featuring over 250 pages of writing, art work, interviews, scholarly articles, technical resources, more than three dozen full color images, and contributions by more than 50 artists, filmmakers, writers, microcinema operators, programmers, archivists, and scholars from the U.S., Canada, and Europe. All funds will go toward the design and printing of the issue. You can view the Table of Contents for INCITE #4 online here.
About the Issue:With Amos Vogel's passing in April 2012, American film culture lost one of its most passionate and influential iconoclasts. INCITE #4, ""Exhibition Guide,"" pays tribute to Vogel's legacy, most notably Cinema 16, a precursor to the flourishing microcinema network of the 1990s and a forebear of today's freewheeling cinespaces. In the age of so-called ""participatory"" media, in which people connect virtually using avatars and aliases to stream data on handheld devices, what binds these social cinematic sites, and makes them flourish? 
While vertically mapping microcinemas of past and present, this issue also surveys the breadth of alternative media exhibition practice, from Dziga Vertov's agit-train and Bill Brand's metro Masstransiscope, to artists who use film without projectors and projectors without film. INCITE #4 seeks to engage the history of unconventional cinemas by zeroing in on those puzzle pieces that don't quite fit. Lost-and-found in the couch cushions and idiosyncratically dog-eared, these are the components of itinerant and expanded cinema practices that don't take place inside four-walled cinema chambers, on screens, online or, even, in a projector fashion. Hopefully, these aberrations will spur readers to reconsider the whole gambit of moving image exhibition.
Contributors include:40 Frames, Adam Abrams, Steve Anker, Rebecca Barten, Christina Battle, Scott Miller Berry, Bill Brand, Bill Brown, David Cox, Bill Daniel, Donna de Ville, Clint Enns, Kate Ewald, Bradley Eros, Flinching Eye Collective, Walter Forsberg, Brian L. Frye, Sandra Gibson, Elena Gorfinkel, Sabine Gruffat, Sabrina Gschwandtner, Josh Guilford, Sarah Halpern, Adelheid Heftberger, Kier-La Janisse, Michael Johnsen, Sharon Johnson, Chris Kennedy, Richard Kerr, Bryan Konefsky, Christy LeMaster, Alain LeTourneau, Light Industry, Jeanne Liotta, Jesse Malmed, Kate MacKay, Alex MacKenzie, Caroline Martel, Theo Michael, Alice Moscoso, David Nelson, Gordon Nelson, Tara Merenda Nelson, Greg Pierce, John Porter, Luis Recoder, Marcus Rosentrater, Ben Russell, David Sherman, Spectacle, Tess Takahashi, tENTATIVELY, a CONVENIENCE, Jonathan Walley, Audrey Young

Highlights include: Bill Daniel's epic list of Who is Bozo Texino? tour stops, Steve Anker's personal history of early American experimental media centers, Jesse Malmed's oral collage history of the Portland experimental media scene, first person + handbill histories of numerous microcinemas including Total Mobile Cinema, Blinding Light!!, Aurora Picture Show, Orgone Cinema, CineCycle, and others, expanded cinema artwork by Sabrina Gschwandtner and Richard Kerr, Walter Forsberg on the early visual music technology ""Auroratone,"" Jonathan Walley on ""Re-creating Expanded Cinema,"" Caroline Martel on the mystery of ""The Film Prayer,"" a DIY Screening Checklist by Christina Battle, a bevy of 16mm projection resources, and much more.

For the past two years, he has visited more than 50 establishments in countries such as, Canada, England, Mexico and Saint Lucia where he has host book signing or motivational speaking engagements. Even though it has become costly to plan these speaking engagements in foreign countries, it means more to him to hear someone say, ""Thank you for allowing me to hang on to my dreams.""

<h1>Alright: Why Write the Book?</h1>
<p>Great question. 60% of college students don't graduate within 4 years. This is nuts.</p>
<p><b>But 40% don't graduate within six</b>.
 And to make things worse, students everywhere suffer from 
sleep-deprivation, stress, physical inactivity, and (of course) huge 
debt that grows with each extra semester.</p>
<p>Even at MIT (my alma mater), friends of mine dropped out because they thought they ""didn't have what it took."" Other friends took 9 or 10 semesters--both miserably and hugely costly for young adults already in mountains of debt. </p>

<p></p>
<p>I think all of the above is unacceptable. My mission with ""How to Crush College"" is to change this 
forever, affecting change at the only place it's realistic: with 
students themselves. I want to take college students from treading water
 to excelling and loving college. <br/></p>
<p>A successful, joyous college career should not be reserved

to eradicate burnout and restore fun. I want to make college great.

<h1>What Inspired You to Write?</h1>
<p>Besides the above stories and statistics, I finally got around to writing after helping enough of my friends one-on-one, and hearing enough of them tell me I should write a book.</p>
<p>Despite being a solid-B student in high school, I managed to sneak out of MIT with a Bachelors (with 2 minors) and a Masters in 4 years, while still getting lots of sleep and never pulling an all-nighter after freshman fall. People with varying levels of success and struggle asked me, ""what are you doing differently?"" It was hard to describe at first, but I started to try crystallizing what I was doing and help others.</p>
<p>The result was a series of cheat sheets, Excel tools, and a lot of one-on-one coaching time with friends and with my fraternity (where I was Scholarship Chair). For some time, this stuff sat around.</p>
<p>In my work as an operations/management consultant (my day job for the past 4 years), I've kept alight my love of really helping make a difference in people's lives... and I've become more confident in my ability to make major changes in people's lives.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h1>How do You Plan to Save College?</h1>
<p>The key principle is this: those that wildly succeed are <i>not </i>separated by those that drop out by superior intellect or work ethic. They have a <i>process, </i>which
 helps them to constantly shed off unnecessary work and redirect this 
time to more important stuff (be it studying for a tough test, sleeping 
more, or taking on extra classes). </p>
<p>In my experience the process 
has been both consistent and (blessedly) simple. Problem is: we don't 
teach it to our kids when they're preparing for college, so they show up
 to their dorms without the tools needed to thrive. I intend to teach 
people how to thrive.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>What Makes You Qualified?</h1>
<p>Having spent 4 years in 
operations/management consulting, I've seen the common principles that 
help certain business cultures excel, and others flail. I've spent my 
career to date turning the flailing cultures into effective ones. 
Clients are consistently amazed at how much they're capable of when they
 change a few practices and mindsets. With small (no-cost) changes in 
how clients manage <i>themselves, </i>we've made incredible things happen (like 50% increases in factory productivity) in a matter of a few months.</p>
<p>In college, some of these principles started to emerge in my mind, but it took me some time to put two and two together. Here's my personal experience:</p>
<p>I graduated 
from MIT in 4 years with a Bachelors and Masters degree, 2 minors, 2 
publications, and some great recommendations. Throughout this, I 
averaged 7 hours of sleep per night, partied on weekends, got to the 
gym, got involved in student government and my fraternity, and took on 
jobs during the school year. I even changed majors twice.<br/></p>
<p>I never pulled an all-nighter after 
my freshman fall, when I got fed up with being miserable and decided to 
take a hard look at how I was using my time. After settling my own life 
(and taking on more), I began to formalize the system I used for my 
friends and others around me. I also started actively noticing what systems others were using for themselves to work. And--you guessed it--the most successful in college also had a unique and commons set of mindsets and practices (and <i>not </i>super-smartness or superior work ethic) that set them apart.<br/></p>So this book is a synthesis of my own college experience and what I've learned in the operations world. The <i>same principles </i>operate
 in both realms: the most successful students and most successful 
businesses alike follow a distinct and common process and approach the 
world with similar mindsets.</span></span><p><br/></p>

<p>Through these, ""Crush College"" acts as a guide every detailed step of the way to victory, going far beyond giving advice and listing good ideas. With specific instructions and tools custom-built to execute on each step students aren't left to ""do the hard part"" on their own--changes are easy and results are both speedy and dramatic. Success builds on itself as students see the impact, work more effectively, and have more available time from each iteration of improvement.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h1>What's in the Book?</h1>
<p>These principles, practices, and mindsets are translated into a very clear, simple step-by-step guide that is targeted directly at college students. Its early steps focus on the biggest picture, pursue the most time, and create early wins that motivate students to keep going and keep making progress.<br/></p>
<p>Without giving 
away too much, the idea is to turn traditional wisdom on its head by 
helping students do more with fewer hours, less pain, and less guilt. 
Instead of helping students read more pages, Crush College helps them 
learn more with fewer. Instead of long, eye-numbing study blocks: short,
 focused ones that take less than half the time. Instead of the 
procrastination-guilt cycle: manipulating our own brains to excitedly 
anti-procrastinate. Instead of following a bunch of tips: systematically
 hunting down the biggest time sinks and custom-building projects to get
 that time back.</p>
<p></p>
<u><strong>Key Principles:</strong></u><strong><br/></strong><ul>
<li>
<strong>Far more improvement is possible </strong>than you believe.</li>
<li>You must <strong>aggressively challenge assumptions</strong> about your work to find the most time to recover.</li>
<li>Being <strong>deeply in touch with your goals </strong>is critical to stay focused and get the most out of college.</li>
<li>Prioritizing is about <strong>choosing what </strong><em><strong>not to do.</strong></em>
</li>
<li>Go after<strong> semesters and weeks</strong> of time--not minutes.</li>
<li>
<strong>80% of the results</strong> come in the first <strong>20% of effort</strong> in whatever you do.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<u><strong>Key Time Recovery Steps:</strong></u><br/><ul>
<li>Clearly define your goals for college and force-rank.</li>
<li>Strictly and aggressively plan your college schedule. </li>
<li>Seek out and take the classes that get you the most out of college--with the least headache and stress.</li>
<li>Break down the toughest projects into smaller chunks.</li>
<li>Set deadlines well in advance and schedule backwards.</li>
<li>Schedule each week into focused blocks--including fun.</li>
<li>Hunt &amp; eliminate waste in everything you do, from goofing off to working hard. Iterate.</li>
<li>Say ""no"" to as much break-in work as you can.</li>
<li>Bonus: ascend to superhuman effectiveness by learning the art of micro-efficiency.
	
</li>
</ul>
<u><strong>Staying Motivated &amp; Focused</strong></u>:<br/><ul>
<li>Learn your own brain: recognize simmering distraction and stop it in its tracks.Make distractions harder to find.
	</li>
<li>Learn how to easily increase your willpower.</li>
<li>Use spurts of focus with precise breaks to maximize effectiveness.
	</li>
<li>Track and share progress--accountability is powerful.</li>
<li>Trust your gut and stay in touch with what's important.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Some Practical Examples: How to...</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Kill the siren song of Facebook once and for all.</li>
<li>Power through your mid-term paper in less than a week, end-to-end.<br/>
</li>
<li>Slash total reading by more than half... and retain more.</li>
<li>Spend less time in the lab, writing code, or designing.<br/>
</li>
<li>Finish 80% of your thesis by the time you officially start.</li>
<li>Take advantage of ""double-dipping"" in requirements to shave a semester off your degree without adding classes.<br/>
</li>
<li>Say ""no"" to unwanted work... even to your professors.</li>
</ul>

<p>The

<p>The rest 
of it (ISBNs, book cover, web page) I am planning to cover out of

What Really Makes ""Crush College"" Different?
There are some talented authors out there like Cal Newport that have written some hugely popular books on the subject. I've read many of them, as well as the mass of ""productivity"" books for business.


I think all fall well short of what students need in a few key ways:
1) Their books are long (very long, in the case of Newport), scattered lists of suggestions and advice. Much of it is even very good advice. But which of it applies to you most? Are you prepared to make some 70+ separate changes once you put the book down? Do you know which few really matter?2) These books (much like Covey's ""7 Habits"") explain what to do, but do not guide students through the challenging process of making permanent personal changes. We've all tried to change before and have often failed. We've all gotten lots of good advice that we haven't carried through, despite our intent.3) They're fundamentally limited to the collective wisdom of the very good--placing a fixed ceiling on what's possible. This holds the ""very good"" back from going further to become truly exceptional.

Success builds on itself as students see the impact, work more effectively, and have more available time from each iteration of improvement.

What's in the Book?
These principles, practices, and mindsets are translated into a very clear, simple step-by-step guide that is targeted directly at college students. Its early steps focus on the biggest picture, pursue the most time, and create early wins that motivate students to keep going and keep making progress.
Without giving 
away too much, the idea is to turn traditional wisdom on its head by 
helping students do more with fewer hours, less pain, and less guilt. 
Instead of helping students read more pages, Crush College helps them 
learn more with fewer. Instead of long, eye-numbing study blocks: short,
 focused ones that take less than half the time. Instead of the 
procrastination-guilt cycle: manipulating our own brains to excitedly 
anti-procrastinate. Instead of following a bunch of tips: systematically
 hunting down the biggest time sinks and custom-building projects to get
 that time back.

Key Principles:

Far more improvement is possible than you believe.
You must aggressively challenge assumptions about your work to find the most time to recover.
Being deeply in touch with your goals is critical to stay focused and get the most out of college.
Prioritizing is about choosing what not to do.

Go after semesters and weeks of time--not minutes.

80% of the results come in the first 20% of effort in whatever you do.




Key Time Recovery Steps:
Clearly define your goals for college and force-rank.
Strictly and aggressively plan your college schedule. 
Seek out and take the classes that get you the most out of college--with the least headache and stress.
Break down the toughest projects into smaller chunks.
Set deadlines well in advance and schedule backwards.
Schedule each week into focused blocks--including fun.
Hunt & eliminate waste in everything you do, from goofing off to working hard. Iterate.
Say ""no"" to as much break-in work as you can.
Bonus: ascend to superhuman effectiveness by learning the art of micro-efficiency.
	


Staying Motivated & Focused:
Learn your own brain: recognize simmering distraction and stop it in its tracks.Make distractions harder to find.
	
Learn how to easily increase your willpower.
Use spurts of focus with precise breaks to maximize effectiveness.
	
Track and share progress--accountability is powerful.
Trust your gut and stay in touch with what's important.

Some Practical Examples: How to...

Kill the siren song of Facebook once and for all.
Power through your mid-term paper in less than a week, end-to-end.

Slash total reading by more than half... and retain more.
Spend less time in the lab, writing code, or designing.

Finish 80% of your thesis by the time you officially start.
Take advantage of ""double-dipping"" in requirements to shave a semester off your degree without adding classes.

Say ""no"" to unwanted work... even to your professors.

Tools: ""How to Crush College"" includes free downloadable tools and applications specifically designed to increase ease and clarity in the entire process.Why do You Need IndieGoGo Funds?
So: I am done writing! The good news for you is that means you don't have to worry about whether I'll deliver.
The
 funding I'm raising is going to be used 100% (after costs of the campaign) for paying an editor and publisher to take this labor of 
love from text to book. Turns out it's very expensive! 
The rest 
of it (ISBNs, book cover, web page) I am planning to cover out of 
pocket, but additional funds will go towards reimbursing for those, 
whose costs are upwards of $550. More funding, thus, is always better.
Note! We're going full-color paperback, which will cost an additional $2700 for the first run of 100, and then prices go down after that. Further funding will help cover these expenses.

How Else Can I Help?Share, share, share. You know, the social media thing. Obviously this book isn't for everyone, but you probably know folks that are in college, or will be. What's the likelihood they'll end up in the 60% that graduate late (or the 40% that go past 6 years)? Alternatively, what would it mean to them to never have to pull an all-nighter? What would it mean to get a second major without killing themselves to do it?


In short, there are millions of folks out there that might be interested. So grab the link from way above, put it in your Facebook, Twitter, all that jazz.
You can also give me feedback in comments. I love feedback, especially the constructive kind. Something missing you want to know? Something not convincing? Tell me!
All in all: wanted to give everyone a big ""thank you"" so far for all the help and interest.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>What's this all about?</strong></h2>
<p>I’ll write whatever you want – and you can watch me do it.</p>
<p>**BREAKING NEWS - UNTIL THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, ALL PERKS ARE NOW DOUBLED IN VALUE. THAT'S RIGHT - YOU GET TWICE THE AMOUNT OF GOODNESS FOR EVERY PERK LISTED ON THE RIGHT. ALL THE MORE REASON TO MAKE A PLEDGE!**</p>
<p>My name’s David Varela and I’m a writer. I’ve written films, plays, games, poems, global ad campaigns, and all sorts of other strange things – but now, for one week only, I’m taking requests. I’ll write what you tell me to.</p>
<p>You can also watch my writing process in action – live, via webcam – and you’ll be able to see every keystroke as I type it on our website.</p>
<p>For 100 hours, my every word is yours. I’m taking a vow of silence and I won’t have any private communications – no texts, no tweets, no emails. Every word is public domain. And everything I write is copyright-free.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What’s the good cause?</strong></h2>
<p>All this is to raise money for Arvon, who run residential creative writing weeks for schools and community groups and are building a collaborative writing platform for young people. You can see their work at <a href=""http://arvonfoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://arvonfoundation.org/</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How much do you need?</strong></h2>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is purely to cover the basic overheads of accommodation and the cost of bolting together the website. I’m not getting a penny out of this, and unless we can cover the basic costs, neither will Arvon. WE WANT TO FAR EXCEED THE INDIEGOGO TARGET – THAT IS THE <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">BARE MINIMUM</span> WE NEED TO RAISE, SO KEEP DONATING.</p>
<p>And if anyone wants to volunteer their web development skills, get in touch. We’re aiming to pay a reasonable fee, but pro bono offers would be much appreciated. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The more we can reduce costs, the more money we can use to help kids.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How exactly does it work?</strong></h2>
<p>Choose a perk on the right hand side of this page and make your donation. When all the donations are in, I’ll be in touch to ask for the specific details of your request – I’m very versatile, so be creative. Then, during a week in December, I’ll write you some wonderful words and make them instantly available on our website. You can even watch the magic as it happens and heckle me/send messages of support.</p>
<p>And feel free to order multiple perks. Want two compliments? Pledge $10 and leave me a note.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Where and when?</strong></h2>
<p>The plan is for me to stay at Arvon’s writing centre in Lumb Bank – former home of Ted Hughes, just down the road from Sylvia Plath’s final resting place. It’s an isolated farmhouse in Yorkshire, and when I’m up there (December 17<sup>th</sup>-22<sup>nd</sup>) it’s going to be cold and probably snowbound. It’s very likely that this whole thing will turn into an online recreation of <em>The Shining</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Is there anything you won’t write?</strong></h2>
<p>As this is raising money for children’s writing development and literacy, I’m steering away from anything entirely depraved. No porn. Sorry. Also, I can’t write anything that will violate someone else’s copyright, so don’t ask me to type out <em>War and Peace. </em>Oh, and nothing libellous. That would be bad.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What if you have too many requests?</strong></h2>
<p>It would be a nice problem to have. I’m not planning to sleep much so I should be able to get through a lot of writing. If I do end up having to choose which requests to fulfil, priority would go to those at the higher funding levels – so be generous.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Will you write my company’s transmedia strategy?</strong></h2>
<p>In a word, yes. However, expect to pay the kind of rate you’d be charged by a business consultant. Just because this is for charity doesn’t mean you can get a cheap deal. And bear in mind that everything I write will be public, so non-disclosure agreements will be tricky.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What’s this ‘copyright-free’ malarkey?</strong></h2>
<p>Everything I write in this week will be released under a <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CC Zero</a> licence. That means you can all copy it, remix it, and do whatever you like with it, and you won’t even need to credit me. I’m a firm believer in Creative Commons, so I’m putting it into action here. I’m also really hoping I don’t come up with a million-dollar idea this week by accident.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Do we get to see you naked?</strong></h2>
<p>No. There will be a webcam, but it won’t be in the bathroom. You might get some hot dressing gown action though.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>And who wrote that catchy music in the video?</strong></h2>
<p>That’s Tom Cusack. Much of his music is available for free under a Creative Commons Attribution licence over <a href=""http://freemusicforvideos.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

It’s very likely that this whole thing will turn into an online recreation of The Shining.
 
Is there anything you won’t write?
As this is raising money for children’s writing development and literacy, I’m steering away from anything entirely depraved. No porn. Sorry. Also, I can’t write anything that will violate someone else’s copyright, so don’t ask me to type out War and Peace. Oh, and nothing libellous. That would be bad.
 
What if you have too many requests?
It would be a nice problem to have. I’m not planning to sleep much so I should be able to get through a lot of writing. If I do end up having to choose which requests to fulfil, priority would go to those at the higher funding levels – so be generous.
 
Will you write my company’s transmedia strategy?
In a word, yes. However, expect to pay the kind of rate you’d be charged by a business consultant. Just because this is for charity doesn’t mean you can get a cheap deal. And bear in mind that everything I write will be public, so non-disclosure agreements will be tricky.
 
What’s this ‘copyright-free’ malarkey?
Everything I write in this week will be released under a CC Zero licence. That means you can all copy it, remix it, and do whatever you like with it, and you won’t even need to credit me. I’m a firm believer in Creative Commons, so I’m putting it into action here. I’m also really hoping I don’t come up with a million-dollar idea this week by accident.
 
Do we get to see you naked?
No. There will be a webcam, but it won’t be in the bathroom. You might get some hot dressing gown action though.
 
And who wrote that catchy music in the video?
That’s Tom Cusack. Much of his music is available for free under a Creative Commons Attribution licence over here.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Story of My Book </h3>
<p><strong><i>Neither Created Nor Destroyed</i> </strong>is a memoir about overcoming trauma and hardship, the complexities of relationships, taking risks, exploration, and self actualization. Though we are evolutions of everything that has come before us, we are not always limited to or created by the beliefs, habits, and hormones that we inherit. Nor are we destroyed. <br/><br/>My name is Nicki Avena and I am the author of <i>Neither Created Nor Destroyed</i>. I wrote this book because I process my experiences and emotions most easily through writing. I am also very drawn to reading memoir. Memoir is a magical portal from the secret and private to the universal. Reading the very personal stories that memoir typically presents, I tend to feel seen, relevant, understood, and therefore connected to something much larger than myself. I am inspired by stories of vulnerability and bravery, by those who go beyond their comfort zones. <br/><br/>In my book I go beyond my comfort zones through physical actions, like traveling around the country and overseas alone, and managing crises. But also through emotional actions, like examining my habits and patterns, and ultimately taking accountability for my lived experiences. For those who may not feel comfortable expressing their emotions through spoken or written words, I feel like I can alleviate their feelings of being unseen, like my favorite authors have done for me.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the strength to reflect honestly on your own lived experiences. And that, by doing so, you’ll gain more empathy and grace for both yourself and those around you. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to be vulnerable alongside me as I sift through my own foibles, learning what I can and cannot control.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>In this book</strong>, you'll encounter the nuanced ways in which trauma can affect brain chemistry, and how I lost control of my life, but got it back again through narratives like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visiting a therapist and learning what Trichotillomania is.</li>
<li>Driving one thousand miles across the Colorado desert, while grieving my sister’s death. </li>
<li>Awakening from a nightmare about “the one who got away,” only to realize that I’ve been pining for connection to myself.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/><strong>You will love this book</strong> if you are fiercely curious and are willing to call your own beliefs into question. If you are willing to look at the dark side of your own moon. If you enjoy absurd and trepidatious stories on nature, friendship, travel, and exploration. And if you intend to live your life bravely and with heart. <br/><br/><i>Neither Created Nor Destroyed</i> speaks to anyone who enjoys memoir, but especially millennials, due to time-period references. The memoir speaks to those who are invested in self discovery, and who want to interact with relationship to themselves and others in a new way.<br/><br/><strong>Ultimately</strong>, I hope that <i>Neither Created Nor Destroyed</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are we still viewing our personal histories through the eyes of our inner children? Or are we viewing them through the faculties of our developed, adult perspectives?</li>
<li>How can we contextualize our lived experiences in relation to the invisible socio-economic systems at play?</li>
<li>Can we develop more empathy for people in our communities, especially those that we judge, through accepting that every person inhabits every shade of the human and emotional spectrum? </li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing topics on grief, love, bravery, and empathy will change us all for the better. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - <i>Neither Created Nor Destroyed</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the Author’s Note + chapters 1-7. In this section the reader will understand my sometimes harmful and sometimes blissful childhood. They’ll begin to form an understanding of my foundations and how I develop maladaptive coping mechanisms. Specifically, readers will witness this through stories like a fist fight with my sister that leaves me stranded on the side of a highway and pulling my hair out before a first date at the movies.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 8-14. In this section the reader will learn how maladaptive coping strategies express in my early twenties through alcohol and consecutive relationships. They will learn what it was like for me to truly lose control, as I straddle the line between my own victimhood and victimizing others. This is expressed, for example, through a story I tell about a reproductive dilemma and an unexpected endowment. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 15-21. In this section the reader will learn some very valuable lessons with me, as I am fast tracked into adulthood through an avalanche of misfortunes. They will also learn how I was able to rescue myself through taking risks, assessing myself honestly, setting boundaries, and, most importantly, feeling everything. This is witnessed through the story of grieving my sister and a story about turning inward for the first time to examine qualities in my self that I have rejected in others.</p>

<h3>About the author</h3>
<p><strong>Nicki Avena</strong> is the Senior Graphic Designer at National Geographic. She’s also an accomplished road and trail runner, having completed her first marathon in January of 2020.Moonlighting as a fine artist, she nurtures personal projects, including writing and painting, inspired by the foibles of the human journey. Additionally, she finds theories of intuition, anthropology, and the curious habits of plant life titillating. She is fascinated by the natural world and feels most comfortable beneath the open sky.<br/><br/>Nicki wrote this book because, in the past, she’s felt remarkably moved when readers have expressed that her writing helped them work through something personal in their own life. Through her book, she wants to add her own, fuller, personal narrative to a great pool of meaning, much like her favorite memoir writers, who have helped contextualize the events of her own life. She is curious how many readers will relate to the very private experiences she vulnerably shares throughout her book. She deeply values relating to others, visual harmony, nesting, freedom, vitality, and mindfulness. She hopes that her book will help someone out there feel seen. <br/><br/>Nicki is a clever dear with a heart that is as big as her hair. She doesn’t totally understand the concept of “time-zones,” wears a robe more often than not, and speaks frankly to birds when no one is looking. <br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Nicki at <strong>NickiAvena@gmail.com</strong> and at <strong>@Nicki.Avena</strong>.</p>

<h3>Why <i>Miscellany</i>?</h3>
<p>Unlike most other kinds of essays, the personal essay is voice-driven, making for extraordinarily compelling reading. Miscellany is full of voices, from the full-throated to the purposefully understated voice. The one thing they all have in common is they are young(ish) American voices narrating the experiences of those who people the fringes of society. </p>
<p>The idea to put together a collection of personal essays has been a pet project at Run Amok Books for some time. Many a lunch hour has been spent in the Run Amok office (more like room) scouring the nonfiction sections of e-zines, looking for the right voices for this collection. It became readily apparent that although these essays were similar in the singularity of their voices, the subject matter one encountered while submersed in them ranged far and wide; thus, giving rise to our title <i>Miscellany</i>.</p>
<h3>Where We Go From Here and How We Get There</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Miscellany will be published September 1, 2018. We feel a great sense of pride and achievement in bringing this book to life. As a small press, we have designed/edited/formatted the book in-house; it is how we keep our costs down. Keeping costs down allows us to publish more worthy books, which is an integral part of the Run Amok mandate. Unfortunately, the budget for pet projects such as <i>Miscellany</i> is virtually non-existent. In order to pay our contributors we need to raise funds. And paying contributors will make publishing Miscellany, Volume 2 next year that much easier.</p>
<h3>That's Where You Come In</h3>
<p>By supporting our Miscellany campaign, you will be directly supporting the authors of this collection. To say that making money as an author is difficult is the granddaddy of all understatements. We want to do our part to change that, and you can help us. A small donation from you will not only help us to pay the authors but also help ensure that further volumes of Miscellany will see the light of day. For that you will have our undying gratitude. Of course, we will also provide perks as a way of saying thank you to our supporters, mainly books and coffee mugs and the like. Have a look and see what tickles your fancy.</p>
<h3><strong>The Numbers Crunch</strong></h3>
<p>The numbers are simple for this campaign. The first $550 dollars we raise will go directly to the authors. Eleven authors contributed to Miscellany, which means each will receive a payment of $50 each (certainly not an extravagant amount considering the hours that go into authoring an essay). Whatever is raised beyond $550 will be used for promotional purposes, specifically, to take out advertisements in the very e-zines where our authors were first discovered. Although online ads are generally more reasonable than print ads, they are still not cheap, running from $300-750, depending on the size and placement of the ad. We would like to raise at least $950 in this campaign, approximately 75% of the funding that we believe we need to pay the authors and do the advertising that we would like to do. Please consider supporting our Miscellany campaign, and help us to get this project off to a running--or at least trotting--start.  </p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Cure Yourself Fearlessly</i> is meant to change your perspective of the battle you are given, to trust yourself and know that you can heal through elements such as mindfulness, fearlessness, perception, mentality, vulnerability, spirituality, community, and prayer. I intertwined my cancer journey with the stories of other young adults who have been through different walks of life, such as dealing with cancer, chronic disease, limb loss, drug addiction, homelessness, and mental health illnesses, as well as the perspective of different life and spiritual coaches, pastors, psychologists, medical doctors, and so much more.<br/><br/>My name is Alexa Cucchiara and I am the author of <i>Cure Yourself Fearlessly.</i> I wrote this book because I want to change the conversation around owning your battle and using it as a way to positively change your trajectory on life and ultimately live fearlessly from your heart. We are all human and all go through storms, but what we need to do is learn to accept them and become encouraged to use other hope-filled stories to transform our own.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to trust your intuition, and use your inner strength and God's power to influence your healing process. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for living through faith in you. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help inspire you to use the themes, inspiring quotes, and questions I ask you to ask yourself at the end of each chapter to transform your life in the way that they helped shift mine.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the power of acceptance, courage, faith, and community through raw and real stories from ordinary humans like me and you:<ul>
<li>I used my memory of going to heaven to help me find peace and see the larger picture in my fight for life.</li>
<li>Jack Wallace used his community at Camp No Limits to inspire him to engage in the activities he loved, despite losing his leg in a boating accident during his childhood, which led him to become a gold-medalist Paralympian.</li>

Cure Yourself Fearlessly is meant to change your perspective of the battle you are given, to trust yourself and know that you can heal through elements such as mindfulness, fearlessness, perception, mentality, vulnerability, spirituality, community, and prayer. I intertwined my cancer journey with the stories of other young adults who have been through different walks of life, such as dealing with cancer, chronic disease, limb loss, drug addiction, homelessness, and mental health illnesses, as well as the perspective of different life and spiritual coaches, pastors, psychologists, medical doctors, and so much more.My name is Alexa Cucchiara and I am the author of Cure Yourself Fearlessly. I wrote this book because I want to change the conversation around owning your battle and using it as a way to positively change your trajectory on life and ultimately live fearlessly from your heart. We are all human and all go through storms, but what we need to do is learn to accept them and become encouraged to use other hope-filled stories to transform our own.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to trust your intuition, and use your inner strength and God's power to influence your healing process. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for living through faith in you. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help inspire you to use the themes, inspiring quotes, and questions I ask you to ask yourself at the end of each chapter to transform your life in the way that they helped shift mine.In this book, you'll learn about the power of acceptance, courage, faith, and community through raw and real stories from ordinary humans like me and you:
I used my memory of going to heaven to help me find peace and see the larger picture in my fight for life.
Jack Wallace used his community at Camp No Limits to inspire him to engage in the activities he loved, despite losing his leg in a boating accident during his childhood, which led him to become a gold-medalist Paralympian.
Grace Wethor used her death sentence and lived against the odds of her 8% survival rate by using her inner strength to pursue her dream of becoming a Vogue model and actress despite living with a brain tumor.

You will love this book if you feel hopeless, question the purpose of your life, and are looking for ways to become uplifted and inspired.Cure Yourself Fearlessly is a non-fiction book that speaks to those facing a battle and/or living with trauma and are looking at a way to find hope and encouragement, and live in less fear.

My Work


My
name is Bill Riley. As a young boy growing up in a small Texas town, I became
fascinated with science fiction novels and movies. While attending a Christian
university, I realized the breath of my skill as a writer. However, it was only
a few years ago that I began my first novel. I felt that it was a good time to
develop a new science fiction collection of works. While Star Trek and Star
Wars are timeless collections, the audience has seen decades of writings and
movies from their creation. Now, a fresh, new science fiction universe has been
developed in my completed novel, Cosmic Space-Realm of Evil. I am passionate
about my new novel from which future novels, games and media entertainment will
be launched. For five years, I have reasoned, studied and fashioned an original
story that is a deep expression of my inner person. Rooted in my understanding of the concepts that
audiences cherished most in Star Trek and Star Wars, I have crafted my novel to
merge those same concepts in an epic tale. My goal is to promote, publish and develop
my work for the entertainment of general audiences around the world.  Your
contribution will help bring this goal to reality. Your support will be a
driving force that launches a new wave of science fiction thrills,
enlightenment and enrichment for the viewing public. In this, you will be
rewarded. The rewards that I discuss herein will give each contributor a piece
of this new universe. 



The Goal


I
am seeking $250,000.00 through my campaign. This is the amount that I estimate
that will be needed to complete this project. These funds will allow for the
publishing of my completed novel. In my research, I have found that it is very
difficult to have a publisher work with a first-time author. The main reason
is that book publishers get thousands of book submissions every day. A new
author has to work to make his novel stand out from the crowd, and I can accomplish
this by doing the following:




Increasing my level of graphics in promotional
videos, print, book cover and book illustrations.
Creating an interactive website that
includes a mid-level game tied to my novel, along with exclusive content
pertaining to the storyline of my novel.
Create an electronic version of my
novel to sell online with Amazon, Barnes and Noble and other e-Book retailers
Fund marketing efforts to drive
traffic to my website, e-Book and general sales of my novel.
Commence work on my sequel novel,
Cosmic Space-Annihilation.



This
is a very exciting time, and it will be a great ride for all of you who help
fund this adventure. As I mentioned above, those who contribute to my project
will be rewarded if my campaign is successful and my novel, Cosmic Space-Realm
of Evil can be published. 
Thank You

<p>The writing of <strong><i>CLANDESTINE</i></strong> became a mission for Ife and Damani because it tells the story of a People’s resilience and the struggle to retain their dignity and their African customs and family connections, as well as a story of unconditional love, passion, and commitment - a story they felt obligated to share. </p>

<p>                           Ife &amp; Damani - Freshman Year at HU (1962)</p>
<p>Damani’s research has confirmed some truly fascinating oral family lore - but not all.  He verified that Mariah worked in the Montgomery, Alabama household of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. </p>
<p><strong><i>Family lore has it that she was a spy for the Union!</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>CLANDESTINE</i></strong> is the story of <strong>YOUR</strong> and OUR Ancestors!!  We felt our Ancestors pushing us at critical junctures in the writing.  Not only was this a husband-wife collaboration, but it has also been a Village project!!!  So many people have assisted us with research, with documents, with encouragement, and above all, with love.  #ClandestineBook</p>
<p>An impetus for writing <strong><i>CLANDESTINE </i></strong>is to promote <strong>LINKING GENERATIONS - </strong>the older with the younger.  It is important that we as a people, both young and old, learn as much as we can about our own ancestry to gain and internalize as much knowledge as we can about the arduous journey of African/Black people and others of good will.  We then must commit to passing this information on from one generation to the next.  It is essential that we push our youth to do likewise by stressing the significance of them becoming positively engaged in our communities. What a difference that will make!  Our youth must be an integral part of preserving the rich history of African/Black people.  In this context and in <strong><i>CLANDESTINE</i></strong>, people of African descent are referenced as African, regardless of their place of birth or nationality.</p>

<p>Although we have contributed to crowdfunding campaigns in the past, we have never launched one ourselves.  We do, however, have a successful track record of sponsoring trips to Panama for almost a decade.  The largest group was an International Women's Retreat in 2004, with more than 100 Special Guests, including 80 who traveled from the USA.  Other groups attended the Panama Jazz Festival and/or vacationed at beach resorts and visited educational sites and, of course, the amazing Panama Canal – a wonder of the world.  We always received rave reviews from our Special Guests and had several requests to sponsor future trips, which we did.  And Ife has authored and published two books.</p>
</div><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">ABOUT THE AUTHORS</h2><p>Following is much more than you probably would EVER want to know about us.  However, IndieGoGo suggests that you get to know us. :-)</p><p><u><strong>Bill “Damani” Keene</strong></u>, educator, researcher and new Author, is a native New Yorker.  His early years were spent in Harlem, living in a small studio apartment in a five-story walk-up tenement building around the corner from his dad’s jewelry shop on 7th Avenue.  When he was eight, his family moved to St. Albans in Queens.  After P.S. 118 and J.H.S. 59, he graduated from Andrew Jackson High School, and in the Fall of 1962, was off to Howard University (HU), at the strong suggestion of his parents.  He was active in numerous campus activities and service projects and was chapter President of his fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega, the National Service Fraternity.</p><p>Upon graduating from Howard, Damani entered the US Air Force as an officer in 1966.  He facilitated a Black History class at McNeil Island Federal Penitentiary.  He was honorably discharged, despite his outspoken opposition to the Vietnam War, as a Captain in 1970.  He then worked as a community organizer in Brooklyn, NY, and entered graduate school at Cornell University to prepare for a career in student services in higher education.  He led protests demanding that Cornell divest its investments in Southern Africa and led a memorial for the men slaughtered by the State of New York at Attica State Prison.</p><p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Damani considered himself very fortunate to return to Howard in 1972 as Associate Director of Student Activities.  By this time, all three of his and Ife’s children had been born and he was enjoying fatherhood.  After returning to the DC area in ‘72, Damani and Ife had continued their activism on behalf of African liberation struggles and were honored to work closely with Kwame Ture (Stokely Carmichael) for many years.  In recognition of the importance of Africentric </span></p><p>                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524687337/grgvnflbowxcdgzpued2.png"" src=""""/>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524687360/lcmpw90wd3yc8gmxc76f.png"" src=""""/>             </p><p>                 Ife &amp; Damani at Africana Center     Ife Greeting Hero Kwame Ture                                      Cornell University - 1971              Howard University - 1998</p><p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>education, he and Ife volunteered in support of Ujamaa Shule and Watoto Shule, both in DC.  During his 32 years at Howard, he served in several positions, including 10 years as Executive Assistant to the Vice President for Student Affairs and for 14 years was in charge of student housing as Dean for Residence Life. He had shorter stints in International Student Services, Blackburn Center (Acting Director at its opening in 1979) and Acting Associate Director Athletics.  At the time of his retirement in 2004, he was the Special Assistant to the Vice Provost for Student Affairs.  Damani enjoyed all of the jobs he had while at Howard and his daily interaction with the students was quite fulfilling.</span></p><p>Following a 2003 trip to South Africa, Damani and Ife decided to depart the US.  They conducted their research, looked at their options and chose Panamá as the best location.  They purchased a home in the mountains, sold their home in Maryland and, in October 2004, moved to Sunset Dreams, to enjoy their little slice of paradise in the mountains of Panamá.  This allowed Damani the time to begin his Family Heritage research in earnest.</p><p>Damani continues to explore his interests in history and politics and shares his perspectives with others online (probably, too much!).</p><p>Ife and Damani are the proud parents of three wonderful children, Khalid V. Keene, Dr. Kweli K. Carson, and Malik I. Keene. They are also the loving parents-in-law of Dr. Reggie Carson and the delighted and proud grandparents of Nandi Anika Carson, Khalid Valentine Keene, II, Brittany Jackson, and great grandparents of Jachai Jackson.</p><p><strong><u>Carole “Ife” Keene</u> </strong>was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, obtained her formative education in Brevard, North Carolina, where she attended kindergarten and 1<sup>st</sup> grade, and then in Camden, New Jersey, where she graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School before attending and graduating from Howard University.  On her second day at Howard, she met William “Damani” Keene.  Together, they enjoyed many memorable times during their four-year courtship at Howard. </p><p>Ife's most fulfilling pursuit at Howard was becoming a member of Gamma Sigma Sigma National Service Sorority, the Sister sorority to Alpha Phi Omega.  She especially enjoyed working on projects that focused on interacting with the youth in Howard's surrounding communities.  In addition to participating in several other campus activities, Ife was Dean of Pledgees during one semester. </p><p>Damani and Ife were married at the end of their senior year.  Enjoying 52 years of a happy marriage, their motto is ""Never stop  honeymooning!""</p><p>           <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Upon receiving a Bachelors of Arts degree in Sociology from Howard, Ife decided to make a drastic career change to the information systems field – a profession dominated by men in the seventies.  She attended a ten-month computer programming training program, where she graduated #2 in her class.  As a result, she was offered a position as a Computer Programmer with the Space Division of General Electric (GE), where she worked for almost two years.  After leaving GE, Ife’s achievements were recognized by repeated promotions to progressively responsible positions during her 20+ years in the information systems arena, including Director of Business Development and Senior Vice President.  </span>Her ultimate accomplishment in the information technology arena was to become a co-owner of a woman-owned and operated management consulting firm, Quality Solutions, Inc. (QSI). </p><p>One of Ife’s most rewarding undertakings was to spearhead a successful one-of-its-kind international women’s retreat in the Republic of Panama in November of 2006.  The concept of Soothe Our Souls (SOS) and the retreat were an outgrowth of a book she wrote and published, <strong><i>Cancer of the Spirit</i></strong>, another of her notable accomplishments.  Over 100 attendees, predominately African-American women, some accompanied by their sweethearts (husbands and boyfriends), from many parts of the U.S., enjoyed a week-long substance- and spiritually-packed agenda, including dynamic speakers, workshops, book signings, excursions, tours, exhibits, massages and facials, salsa dance lessons, and unforgettable entertainment from Panamanian and U.S. entertainers. </p><p>For many years, Ife also graced the motivational speaking scene and conducted workshops that focused on self-improvement, an underlying theme of <strong><i>Cancer of the Spirit</i></strong><i>.</i></p><p>Visit <i><strong><a href=""http://www.sootheoursouls.com/sosretreat.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sootheoursouls.com/sosretreat.html</a></strong></i> for a summary of retreat activities and testimonials, and <i><strong><a href=""http://www.sootheoursouls.com/gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sootheoursouls.com/gallery/</a></strong></i> for photos.  Also visit <strong><i><a href=""http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/146049"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/146049</a> </i></strong>for review and purchase of Ife’s second book, an e-book, <strong><i>All Of A Sudden</i> <i>It’s T</i></strong><strong><i>oo Late</i></strong>,</p><p>#ClandestineBook</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><strong>MANY THANKS!!!  DAALU!!!  GRACIAS!!!

CLANDESTINE – LINKING GENERATIONS: A story for all generations.  Help us encourage your child, grandchild, another child or young adult to learn more about their history.  If you are the young adult, do likewise for your parents, cousins, aunts, uncles, classmates, etc.
The writing of CLANDESTINE became a mission for Ife and Damani because it tells the story of a People’s resilience and the struggle to retain their dignity and their African customs and family connections, as well as a story of unconditional love, passion, and commitment - a story they felt obligated to share. 
Damani and Ife lift up and honor the ancestors' implacable resistance despite a century’s long effort to obliterate those cultural essentials.
So,..
...you discovered that YOUR enslaved Ancestor was a human wedding gift?  After the lump in your throat, the sadness in your soul and the anger in your heart subside, would YOU forget about it?  We could not!
GREETINGS FAMILY, FRIENDS, SUPPORTERS AND BOOK LOVERS,
WE INTRODUCE YOU TO:
CLANDESTINE: THE TIMES AND SECRET LIFE OF MARIAH OTEY REDDICK, a book inspired by the life of William “Damani” Keene's great-grandmother Mariah. He and Carole “Ife” Keene, as Contributing Author, decided on historical fiction as the best genre to tell their story.  CLANDESTINE is the book that each one of us would be compelled to write to ensure the preservation of the history and legacy of our Ancestors. We seek your help to tell our story, YOUR story, the untold story of a People marginalized in history.
                
                           Ife & Damani - Freshman Year at HU (1962)
Damani’s research has confirmed some truly fascinating oral family lore - but not all.  He verified that Mariah worked in the Montgomery, Alabama household of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. 
Family lore has it that she was a spy for the Union!
CLANDESTINE is the story of YOUR and OUR Ancestors!!  We felt our Ancestors pushing us at critical junctures in the writing.  Not only was this a husband-wife collaboration, but it has also been a Village project!!!  So many people have assisted us with research, with documents, with encouragement, and above all, with love.  #ClandestineBook
An impetus for writing CLANDESTINE is to promote LINKING GENERATIONS - the older with the younger.  It is important that we as a people, both young and old, learn as much as we can about our own ancestry to gain and internalize as much knowledge as we can about the arduous journey of African/Black people and others of good will.  We then must commit to passing this information on from one generation to the next.  It is essential that we push our youth to do likewise by stressing the significance of them becoming positively engaged in our communities. What a difference that will make!  Our youth must be an integral part of preserving the rich history of African/Black people.  In this context and in CLANDESTINE, people of African descent are referenced as African, regardless of their place of birth or nationality.
HOW MANY GENERATIONS OF FAMILY CAN YOU LINK?WE CAN LINK SEVEN!  THIS IS IFE'S SIDE...
          
   1st  Generation                    2nd Generation          3rd Generation

Together as a village, we can have a huge impact on preserving our heritage.  We can do this powerfully by sharing with many others the resistance, resilience, beauty, glory, and splendor of African people and by participating in LINKING GENERATIONS.  We believe this is an influential and positive way to have a monumental effect on future generations.  Give a youngster a copy of CLANDESTINE and then dialogue with him or her.  
Again, We Humbly Ask For YOUR Support - NO DONATION IS TOO SMALL! 
We humbly ask for your support and cannot express our appreciation and gratitude enough!  Without you and your kind and generous donation and support, our project would be delayed.  Your willing participation in this effort validates our sense of urgency to tell Mariah’s story.  This is one of the many reasons we say that  CLANDESTINE is OUR story and YOUR story, too.
CLANDESTINE uniquely includes a wealth of true, but lesser known historical facts about the trials and tribulations, and strength and resilience of African/Black people.  We are committed to telling an honest, uplifting and inspiring story about how African/Black people have overcome and survived the challenges and injustices that we have faced and continue to face. 
We are confident you will willingly endorse this project if you are:  

a lover of people;
enthusiastic about future generations acquiring accurate knowledge about the  history of African/Black people;
a history buff;
a reader of historical fiction;
all about family and friends; or
all of the above.

We have expended substantial funds to get the project to this point.  However, there are additional expenditures, which require supplemental funds to complete the project.  They include funds:

to pay an editor – as a supplement to our monies;
for enhancements to website functionality; and
for the book jacket art and design.

We thank you in advance for your endorsement and support.  ANY AND ALL DONATIONS AND SUPPORT ARE WELCOME AND APPRECIATED - NO MATTER HOW LARGE OR SMALL!
Just So You Know...
Our personal expenditures to date include:

four trips to Franklin, Tennessee to conduct research and get a feel for the ambiance that existed during Mariah’s life at Carnation Plantation versus how the city exists today;
payment to two potential editors - one to review and edit the book’s Prologue and the other to conduct a detailed assessment of the entire manuscript;
payment to a crowdfunding expert to learn how to launch a successful campaign;
payment for marketing  and other software;

payment for the design and printing of promotional items for marketing CLANDESTINE; and
initial payment for development of the CLANDESTINE-Life.com website.


Contemplating her resilience and courage, Damani stands in The Quarters at Carnton Plantation, where his great-grandmother Mariah may have lived while she was held in bondage.

OUR TRACK RECORD
Although we have contributed to crowdfunding campaigns in the past, we have never launched one ourselves.  We do, however, have a successful track record of sponsoring trips to Panama for almost a decade.  The largest group was an International Women's Retreat in 2004, with more than 100 Special Guests, including 80 who traveled from the USA.  Other groups attended the Panama Jazz Festival and/or vacationed at beach resorts and visited educational sites and, of course, the amazing Panama Canal – a wonder of the world.  We always received rave reviews from our Special Guests and had several requests to sponsor future trips, which we did.  And Ife has authored and published two books.
ABOUT THE AUTHORSFollowing is much more than you probably would EVER want to know about us.  However, IndieGoGo suggests that you get to know us. :-)Bill “Damani” Keene, educator, researcher and new Author, is a native New Yorker.  His early years were spent in Harlem, living in a small studio apartment in a five-story walk-up tenement building around the corner from his dad’s jewelry shop on 7th Avenue.  When he was eight, his family moved to St. Albans in Queens.  After P.S. 118 and J.H.S. 59, he graduated from Andrew Jackson High School, and in the Fall of 1962, was off to Howard University (HU), at the strong suggestion of his parents.  He was active in numerous campus activities and service projects and was chapter President of his fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega, the National Service Fraternity.Upon graduating from Howard, Damani entered the US Air Force as an officer in 1966.  He facilitated a Black History class at McNeil Island Federal Penitentiary.  He was honorably discharged, despite his outspoken opposition to the Vietnam War, as a Captain in 1970.  He then worked as a community organizer in Brooklyn, NY, and entered graduate school at Cornell University to prepare for a career in student services in higher education.  He led protests demanding that Cornell divest its investments in Southern Africa and led a memorial for the men slaughtered by the State of New York at Attica State Prison.Damani considered himself very fortunate to return to Howard in 1972 as Associate Director of Student Activities.  By this time, all three of his and Ife’s children had been born and he was enjoying fatherhood.  After returning to the DC area in ‘72, Damani and Ife had continued their activism on behalf of African liberation struggles and were honored to work closely with Kwame Ture (Stokely Carmichael) for many years.  In recognition of the importance of Africentric                                                      Ife & Damani at Africana Center     Ife Greeting Hero Kwame Ture                                      Cornell University - 1971              Howard University - 1998education, he and Ife volunteered in support of Ujamaa Shule and Watoto Shule, both in DC.  During his 32 years at Howard, he served in several positions, including 10 years as Executive Assistant to the Vice President for Student Affairs and for 14 years was in charge of student housing as Dean for Residence Life. He had shorter stints in International Student Services, Blackburn Center (Acting Director at its opening in 1979) and Acting Associate Director Athletics.  At the time of his retirement in 2004, he was the Special Assistant to the Vice Provost for Student Affairs.  Damani enjoyed all of the jobs he had while at Howard and his daily interaction with the students was quite fulfilling.Following a 2003 trip to South Africa, Damani and Ife decided to depart the US.  They conducted their research, looked at their options and chose Panamá as the best location.  They purchased a home in the mountains, sold their home in Maryland and, in October 2004, moved to Sunset Dreams, to enjoy their little slice of paradise in the mountains of Panamá.  This allowed Damani the time to begin his Family Heritage research in earnest.Damani continues to explore his interests in history and politics and shares his perspectives with others online (probably, too much!).Ife and Damani are the proud parents of three wonderful children, Khalid V. Keene, Dr. Kweli K. Carson, and Malik I. Keene. They are also the loving parents-in-law of Dr. Reggie Carson and the delighted and proud grandparents of Nandi Anika Carson, Khalid Valentine Keene, II, Brittany Jackson, and great grandparents of Jachai Jackson.Carole “Ife” Keene was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, obtained her formative education in Brevard, North Carolina, where she attended kindergarten and 1st grade, and then in Camden, New Jersey, where she graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School before attending and graduating from Howard University.  On her second day at Howard, she met William “Damani” Keene.  Together, they enjoyed many memorable times during their four-year courtship at Howard. Ife's most fulfilling pursuit at Howard was becoming a member of Gamma Sigma Sigma National Service Sorority, the Sister sorority to Alpha Phi Omega.  She especially enjoyed working on projects that focused on interacting with the youth in Howard's surrounding communities.  In addition to participating in several other campus activities, Ife was Dean of Pledgees during one semester. Damani and Ife were married at the end of their senior year.  Enjoying 52 years of a happy marriage, their motto is ""Never stop  honeymooning!""           Upon receiving a Bachelors of Arts degree in Sociology from Howard, Ife decided to make a drastic career change to the information systems field – a profession dominated by men in the seventies.  She attended a ten-month computer programming training program, where she graduated #2 in her class.  As a result, she was offered a position as a Computer Programmer with the Space Division of General Electric (GE), where she worked for almost two years.  After leaving GE, Ife’s achievements were recognized by repeated promotions to progressively responsible positions during her 20+ years in the information systems arena, including Director of Business Development and Senior Vice President.  Her ultimate accomplishment in the information technology arena was to become a co-owner of a woman-owned and operated management consulting firm, Quality Solutions, Inc. (QSI). One of Ife’s most rewarding undertakings was to spearhead a successful one-of-its-kind international women’s retreat in the Republic of Panama in November of 2006.  The concept of Soothe Our Souls (SOS) and the retreat were an outgrowth of a book she wrote and published, Cancer of the Spirit, another of her notable accomplishments.  Over 100 attendees, predominately African-American women, some accompanied by their sweethearts (husbands and boyfriends), from many parts of the U.S., enjoyed a week-long substance- and spiritually-packed agenda, including dynamic speakers, workshops, book signings, excursions, tours, exhibits, massages and facials, salsa dance lessons, and unforgettable entertainment from Panamanian and U.S. entertainers. For many years, Ife also graced the motivational speaking scene and conducted workshops that focused on self-improvement, an underlying theme of Cancer of the Spirit.Visit http://www.sootheoursouls.com/sosretreat.html for a summary of retreat activities and testimonials, and http://www.sootheoursouls.com/gallery/ for photos.  Also visit http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/146049 for review and purchase of Ife’s second book, an e-book, All Of A Sudden It’s Too Late,#ClandestineBookMANY THANKS!!!  DAALU!!!  GRACIAS!!! ASANTE SANA!!!Again, we thank each of you in advance for your confidence in our project and for your donations and support.  Also, and more importantly, thank you so very much for all that you have already personally done to recognize, elevate, honor and promote the dignity and triumphs of African/Black people.  We cannot stress enough how much we would also appreciate your endorsement of our promotion of LINKING GENERATIONS. OTHER WAYS YOU CAN SUPPORT THIS PROJECT1.  Mailing ListSign up for our mailing list at http://clandestine-life.com/contact-us/so that we can tell you about our special program to ""Honor Thy Ancestor.""2.  Sharing on Social MediaWhether or not you give a monetary donation, we ask that you PLEASE SHARE the LINK to this INDIEGOGO campaign with all of your family and personal friends by:

That’s where we come in…</p><p>At Caddie Magazine, we've been working hard for the last year to bring a new type of golf publication to life. We've sourced 125 pages of remarkable stories and breathtaking photography from all over the world, and put them into a beautiful, minimalist layout. </p><p> </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p> </p><p>We took our idea to some of the biggest brands in golf. They’re still coming round to the idea, so we're having to go it alone for Volume One. </p><p>We want to give the incredible content we've collated from around the world the space and quality it deserves, so we're printing it on thick heavy stock, perfect bound and matte finished.</p><p><strong>Volume One will be timeless and, we hope one day, a collectible.</strong></p><p>To do it right, we need your help to cover our print costs and release Caddie Magazine out into the world. We've secured a print partner, distribution partner and enough funding to get us halfway there.</p><p>Help us tee off with a pre-print subscription and let us be your Caddie – your trusted advisor, motivator, fellow traveller and drinking buddy.</p><p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p> </p><p>We love the game of golf, but even more than that, we love everything around it – the people, the places, the way it makes you feel, the freedom and sense of connection.</p><p>Caddie is pro-adventure, unisex, fun, and inspiring – a mag as much for the non-golfers as it is for the diehards. Because golf ought to be for everyone: the young and the old, for women and men – and even people who’ve never played.</p><p>We know golf is so much more than just a game, which is why we decided to share its incredible stories and stunning visuals with the world.</p><p>It costs a fair bit to get a magazine off the ground these days – especially one that looks beautiful and lasts the distance.</p><p>Caddie is a magazine, but it’s also a movement – we want to change the way the world sees golf.</p><p> </p><p><strong>We promise you’ll love it.</strong></p><p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p> </p><p>We realise that we’re launching a product into an industry that is in the midst of huge change. Lots of people tell us the magazine industry is dying. And in a sense, when you look at the traditional golf mag – all colour glossy, overrun with ads and lacking gender balance, it’s not hard to see why.</p><p>But we’re motivated by the new wave of magazine publications that cater to niche markets with rich aesthetic, timeless content and a voice that relates to the everyday person. Our price point is on the higher end, but our audience is one that prioritises quality above all else. There is always room for a quality, tangible publication like Caddie.</p><p>We recognise it will take time to build an audience. Our readers and subscribers are essential to the success of Caddie, affording us the financial capacity to continue printing the mag. We have applied our professional strengths to broaden the Caddie umbrella by providing a range of products and services that complement the magazine and provide us with more financial stability.</p><p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p> </p><p>Everyone that we talk to about Caddie say what a ‘great idea’ it is.

</div></div>","Campaign Pitch Golf is a remarkable sport. It's inspiring, fun, frustrating, addictive, unisex and global – so why aren’t there any magazines out there reflecting this reality? That’s where we come in…At Caddie Magazine, we've been working hard for the last year to bring a new type of golf publication to life. We've sourced 125 pages of remarkable stories and breathtaking photography from all over the world, and put them into a beautiful, minimalist layout.  What We Need & What You Get We took our idea to some of the biggest brands in golf. They’re still coming round to the idea, so we're having to go it alone for Volume One. We want to give the incredible content we've collated from around the world the space and quality it deserves, so we're printing it on thick heavy stock, perfect bound and matte finished.Volume One will be timeless and, we hope one day, a collectible.To do it right, we need your help to cover our print costs and release Caddie Magazine out into the world. We've secured a print partner, distribution partner and enough funding to get us halfway there.Help us tee off with a pre-print subscription and let us be your Caddie – your trusted advisor, motivator, fellow traveller and drinking buddy. The Impact We love the game of golf, but even more than that, we love everything around it – the people, the places, the way it makes you feel, the freedom and sense of connection.Caddie is pro-adventure, unisex, fun, and inspiring – a mag as much for the non-golfers as it is for the diehards. Because golf ought to be for everyone: the young and the old, for women and men – and even people who’ve never played.We know golf is so much more than just a game, which is why we decided to share its incredible stories and stunning visuals with the world.It costs a fair bit to get a magazine off the ground these days – especially one that looks beautiful and lasts the distance.Caddie is a magazine, but it’s also a movement – we want to change the way the world sees golf. We promise you’ll love it. Risks & Challenges We realise that we’re launching a product into an industry that is in the midst of huge change. Lots of people tell us the magazine industry is dying. And in a sense, when you look at the traditional golf mag – all colour glossy, overrun with ads and lacking gender balance, it’s not hard to see why.But we’re motivated by the new wave of magazine publications that cater to niche markets with rich aesthetic, timeless content and a voice that relates to the everyday person. Our price point is on the higher end, but our audience is one that prioritises quality above all else. There is always room for a quality, tangible publication like Caddie.We recognise it will take time to build an audience. Our readers and subscribers are essential to the success of Caddie, affording us the financial capacity to continue printing the mag. We have applied our professional strengths to broaden the Caddie umbrella by providing a range of products and services that complement the magazine and provide us with more financial stability. Other Ways You Can Help Everyone that we talk to about Caddie say what a ‘great idea’ it is. In fact, “it’s a great idea” has become our weekly meeting catch cry. Now is the best time to support our great idea and assist us in teeing off.We’re keen users of social media so ‘like’ us on Facebook, ‘follow’ us on Instagram and tag any of your golf loving friends on our social streams.We see a huge future for Caddie and we really want to share our ‘great idea’ with as many as possible. We can’t do it without you!For more details on the printed edition, see our website.Caddie Magazine // Production stills Caddie Films // Production examplesMark Pond - Produced for Golf Australia

<h3>Why Primates? Why Me? Why Now?</h3>
<p>Did you have a passion as a kid? Mine was apes. I could spend hours watching the gorillas and chimps at the Aspinall parks in Kent, where I grew up. I wanted to learn more about them. My college friends even said that I was most likely to be trekking in the jungles saving apes in my future.</p>
<p>But I didn't believe in myself enough to follow that path. Instead, I went to grad school, worked, married, and settled down. Admittedly, I didn't exactly do that in a conventional way, but I knew I wasn't a scientist so what could I do?</p>
<p>As it turns out, I could and can do a lot. You see I write. I write for a living. I write about things that fascinate me. And I write to teach others. I've authored several books, written for encylopedias, magazines, and more. </p>
<p>So now it's time.</p>
<p>It's time to believe in myself, believe in my dreams, and write about apes. </p>
<p>I'm heading to South Africa. That's an important point - no matter how much funding I am able to raise here, I am going to South Africa in the spring of 2013 and I will be volunteering at a primate rescue facility. </p>
<p>So where does IndieGoGo come in? Simple.</p>
<p>I can afford to spend some time at one facility, but the more I raise, the longer I can stay and the more research I can. Raising extra funds will allow me to spend time at two facilities, including Jane Goodall's Chimp Eden, where I can not only volunteer but undertake an in-depth primate education program, learning about chimp habitats, rehabilitation, conservation, and so on.</p>
<p>With that extra time, experience, and research, I can produce a better result:</p>
<ul>
<li>a book of photographs from my stay, illustrating conservation programes in South Africa</li>
<li>a non-fiction book about my time there and about the importance of primate conservation programs </li>
<li>a slideshow and educational program which I can give at local schools and community groups</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<p>As I mentioned, I am going regardless of how much money I raise. But this is not a cheap undertaking. Costs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>travel, both to South Africa and within the country</li>
<li>program fees, also living expenses and associated costs</li>
<li>vaccinations - to include hepatitis, cholera, rabies (I will be in contact with wild animals) and whatever else I need. OUCH!</li>
<li>costs associated with producing both books</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I know not everyone can afford to contribute financially, but if you're interested in helping, as little as $10 can help my bottom line. You can also help by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing this with other folks you know. </li>
<li>Reading updates as I post them here. </li>
<li>Helping to support conservation efforts.</li>

<h3>UPDATE 4:</h3>
<p>With only 4 days left and all of our initial goals met, we've decided that we probably should have factored in some promotional budget with the campaign!

We plan to launch a Facebook Ad campaign as well as some Google ads as well! Every little bit helps!! Thanks so much!</p>
<h3> </h3>

<h3>UPDATE 2:</h3>
<p>FULLY FUNDED!!!! IN UNDER A WEEK??? Oh my word! My heart overflows! I can not even begin to thank all who have made this possible. THIS FLOORS ME! <strong>SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN NOW?</strong> All funds that are donated above and beyond the goal will go towards funding future projects, of which there are many!!! I can't wait to share them with you in the future! The campaign runs through July 8th, so let's see what else we can accomplish together! AGAIN!!! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!!!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Julie Presley, I am a wife, a mom, a singer and a writer! I was inspired a number of years ago to attempt to tear down some barriers in myself based on how I was taught growing up in the Church, and this book is the result of that process.</p>
<p>Stones of Remembrance is an out-of-the-box, genre pushing Christian romance novel about coming to grips with the fact that God is good, inspite of tragedy and pain, and recognizing that until we really believe in that truth, we can't fully receive the gifts that He has for us. Secondly, it embraces the fact that we were lovingly created as sexual beings, and that is not something to feel shame about or deny in ourselves. </p>
<p>Allaya Sheldon, struggling to recover from a family tragedy, seeks retreat from the city, in need of solitude and healing, but she is met head on by what seems to be a huge distraction -- a childhood friend who stirs up something inside Allaya's heart that she never expected to feel again.</p>
<p>Finn Meyers has baggage of his own to deal with and his hard-hitting questions are what finally push Allaya to her breaking point, which is exactly where the Father needs her to be so that He can begin to piece together her broken heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The goal is to self-publish this novel, primarily for e-books to start, but also to print at least 100 paperback copies so that I can get into bookstores for signings etc., develop a following, and generate an income stream that can both print more books and create reserves for future publications, four of which are currently in the works including a three part series!</p>
<p>The breakdown:</p>
<p>//Basic self-publishing costs include purchasing ISBN numbers, editing, various website registration costs and legal fees. Those items total roughly $1000.</p>
<p>//Other costs include cover art, author headshots, campaign fees and on-demand printing fees (including shipping),  $2400.</p>
<p>I wouldn't ask you to support me without doing something in return for you. Please check out the perks to the right of the screen!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This book is a realistic love story between God, woman, and man.  It pushes boundaries within the genre which have been long established and at times aggresively defended. To say that I embark upon this journey with trepidation is a mild understatement. However, one of the greatest things that we struggle with as believers is that we are fearfully and wonderfully made. It is a phrase that we attempt to understand and add to our belief system, but one that we seldomly recieve fully, much less walk in. This book helps the reader acknowledge God's goodness and grace in the way He created us, rather than shying away from it, repressing it, or receiving guilt and shame into our hearts. Stones of Remembrance resounds with clarity of the truth that we were created for intimate relationship with each other <em>and</em> with God, and that it is so easily attainable -- He doesn't hold us at arms length. He wants to embrace us fully, and His love is not selective.</p>

</h3>
<p>Imagine for a moment that you come home from work today and it's raining. Your husband/wife also arrives home and you all grab dinner with the kids. You turn on the news and see that a storm is hitting the area and things are expected to get much worse. You decide to stay home because there have been false alarms in the past and you have candles and batteries and all the stuff necessary, just ""in case."" <br/></p>
<p>And then the lights go out, and the wind picks up. Your 4-year-old daughter screams ""Daddy I'm scared"" from her room and you rush to calm her down. Suddenly a tree limb violently smashes into your living-room through a window, and as you go to the window to see the damage you notice that your car is floating away. <br/></p>
<p>Things are getting much worse. The water is rising and is now seeping under your front door. You decide to get some survival supplies from the basement, but as you open the basement door you realize that your basement is gone, totally flooded and the water is rising rapidly.</p>
<p>Water is now rushing in through all of your doors and rising towards the windows. Now you're scared, really scared. You live in a one floor home and you're kicking yourself that you never fixed the stairs to the crawlspace. The water in your home is now three feet high and rising and you realize that you have to leave, right now. The two of you grab your kids and rush out the front door together, clinging to one another and to a few air mattresses that were in the kids room. <br/></p>
<p>Moments after you wade into the rapidly moving water surge, the flotation you are clinging to is ripped away from you and you are all separated. You are moving at high speed in a torrent of water, refuse, trees and cars, and it is all going towards the Atlantic Ocean. <br/></p>
<p>What do you do now?<br/></p>
<p>My full name is David Osterczy. I am a photographer and writer by trade, and I shoot photos and relate stories that I hope elicits passion in my readers. I am a father of 3 amazing kids, and I have a story to share with you. <br/></p>
<p>On October 29-30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast of the USA with a destructive force rarely seen in these parts. 15 foot waves repeatedly hit the shoreline in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The devastation, loss of life, and destruction of property was massive due to several factors:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/139809/files/20131017210836-IMG_7229.JPG?1382069316"" src="""" style=""width: 579.908px; height: 387px;""/></p>
<p>1) It was a full moon that evening.</p>
<p>2) It was high tide when the brunt of the storm hit.</p>
<p>3) It was a category 1 hurricane, despite what they tell you. <br/></p>
<p>Several days after the storm I received a call from my friend, Bruce Spierer. Bruce is a young man committed to community service, in an organization we are both members of, MDI, which fosters service to mankind on many levels. <br/></p>
<p>Bruce implored me to come out and help on Staten Island, which was hit particularly hard, and to ""bring my men and anyone else willing to do the dirty work.""</p>
<p>We spent the entire next weekend gutting and tearing apart homes, from the ceilings to the sub-floors. The sheer amount of refuse from demolition that our team of 30 men and women created was unbelievable, <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/139811/files/20131017211045-IMG_6653.JPG?1382069445"" src="""" style=""width: 487.5px; height: 325px;""/></p>
<p>yet it paled in comparison to what we saw being dumped on Midland  Beach by huge army  trucks. The pile was about 30 feet high, 300-400 feet long, and about 50 feet wide. This was the demolished remains of peoples homes and lives, and more was coming every hour. <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/139817/files/20131017211357-IMG_6721.JPG?1382069637"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>No-one could believe the sheer destruction. It truly looked like photos I've seen of third-world countries, yet here we were in New York City. <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/139823/files/20131017211800-IMG_6640.JPG?1382069880"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Afterwards, I was useless until the following Wednesday because I hurt in places I didn't know I had, as did many of the members of our team. Here we are after day one. I'm the guy kneeling on the far right with the grey camo pants.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/139825/files/20131017211940-IMG_6727.JPG?1382069980"" src="""" style=""width: 573.995px; height: 383px;""/></p>
<br/><p>And we went right back the following weekend and most every weekend since. No accounting for intelligence, eh? <br/></p>
<p>This project is focused on the south shore of Staten Island, New York, and is the story of the families who lived through this horrific storm, some of whom barely survived, and all of whom lost everything they had. It will be told in ""storybook format"" directly from the mouths of those who lived it. All the passion, all the tears, terror, pain, and suffering that goes along with being a survivor of devastation. This story will also be told by the men and women who repeatedly put themselves in harm's way, the volunteers who refuse to give in to this day, and many days beyond until all these families are back in the homes that they love. <br/></p>What I and my team are committed to:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Complete this book and multimedia campaign to spread the word and raise awareness that hundreds upon hundreds of families are still not back in their homes, a full year since the storm ended. <br/>
</li>
<li>Raise $50,000.00+, to be able to dedicate myself full time to this project until it's completion (I already left my job. I am terrified and excited all at the same time!).<br/>
</li>
<li>With this awareness and with non-profit aide, raise additional funding to assure that these families get the support that they need to rebuild safely, properly, and professionally. <br/>
</li>
<li>Donate a large portion of book sales to YellowBoots.org, a 501(c)3 not-for-profit that creates miracles across the country when any sort of disaster hits. They are true heroes in every sense of the word and I am proud to have worked shoulder to shoulder with them on many occasions. </li>
<li>And that every single family featured in this book (and many others) are safely back in their homes. I may be repeating myself here, it is that important to us, and to them. </li>
</ul>
<h3> Why We Need Your Full Support!<br/>
</h3>
<p>To be able to do this correctly, we need a great videographer, video editor, book copy-editor, cover artist, amazing publisher (speaking to Outskirts Press and I really like them!), lots of equipment, and a super-staff to assist me with the hundreds of interviews compiling many, many of hours of difficult footage. <br/></p>
<p>Some discussed expenses we will incur are:</p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">Professionally shot video @$150.00/hour X 100 hours = $15,000.00</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">Gas,Tolls, from The Bronx to Staten Island @ $30.00 per trip X 100 trips = $3000.00</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">Professional Video Editing (to be determined) and uploading all finished videos to a private YouTube account, accessible only with a login code. <br/></span></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">Selp Publication Package including PR, Book Cover, ebooks, etc. = $1500.00</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">Professional Copy Editor for book = $5000.00</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">These numbers can be minimized to a degree if we buy our own equipment, however that too is expensive! <br/></span></span></span></p>
<p>And of course there's the writing. So very much writing! If you've ever written a novel then you understand what a huge undertaking this is. Add the multi-media stuff, and, well, it's HUGE! Fortunately, this ain't my first rodeo, I've been published multiple times. <br/></p>
<p>Additionally, we must be careful where we park in Staten Island. These people do NOT fool around!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/141138/files/20131018130425-IMG_8181.JPG?1382126665"" src="""" style=""width: 298.667px; height: 448px;""/></p>Okay, now seriously: <br/><ul>
<li>Much of the money raised will go towards funding this project, however portions will immediately go towards supplies to assist the rebuilding effort. <br/>
</li>
<li>Public relations will need to be enhanced and involved through my publisher. <br/>
</li>
<li>A dedicated website upon completion of this campaign, for continued contributions through a 501(c)3 non-profit we are in negotiations with presently (it looks good and they love the idea!). </li>
<li>And we need YOU to share this through social media with everyone that you know who cares about families, kids, and just great people in general. <br/>
</li>
<li>And if we fall short of our goal, the funds will come out of our pockets, where they have been coming from for nearly a year now. This will happen, no matter what! <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>Just imagine yourself and your kids in this situation; you come home from work and it's windy and raining. No problem. You prepare dinner and notice that the lights are flickering and the wind seems a lot stronger. You look out the window and cars are floating by, some with people still in them.</p>
<p>The lights go out. Now you're scared. Suddenly water begins to seep into your front door. If you're very, very lucky you have a second level to go to, if not, what do you do? Your wife and kids scream as the waves bash in your front door and 7 feet of water fill your home in seconds. <br/></p>
<p>Why am I repeating myself? Because this has happened to the people featured in this book, and much worse. <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>This project is only the beginning of a much larger idea.</li>
<li>Getting people to understand that there WILL be more storms similar to Sandy, and they will be coming more often than we are being told. <br/>
</li>
<li>Our small team has accomplished more than 1.5 million dollars in demolition, rebuilding, and fundraising over the past 11 months with no prior experience and no professional backing. Imagine what we can accomplish with your help? <br/>
</li>
<li>Nothing will stop us from attaining our goals.<br/>
</li>
<li>What can you do to assist us? <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>If you are not in position to help monetarily, please spread the word the best way that you know how. Social media is great for this, however word-of-mouth is amazingly effective! Please utilize the Indiegogo share tools to assist you in getting the word out! </p>
<p>Please volunteer locally in your community. You have absolutely no idea how amazing it feels to be able to look in the mirror and KNOW that you made someone's life a little better today, tomorrow, and continue to do it! It is a truly empowering, incredible feeling! This work has changed my life, altered my focus, and all the volunteers I have had the honor to work with feel the same way! </p>

These were the very orange roots of one of many trees downed in Hurricane Sandy. So I may have mentioned that I'm an art-photographer?

It is by far my most popular selling image:<br/><br/>It is entitled ""Hot Stalactites"" and is included in the ""perks"" to your right, signed and numbered as a gorgeous Gallery Plexi. Gallery Plexis are the most beautiful way to display fine art. You have to see one to believe how amazing they are. Many fine artists here in New York will only display in this format due to the incredible nature of the high quality printing, and gallery quality plexiglass utilized. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/141134/files/20131018130148-IMG_8240_InkOutlines_Implode_PolarCoordinatesRectangle.jpg?1382126508"" src="""" style=""width: 575.349px; height: 384px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Since I've never done anything like Indiegogo before, my friends have suggested that I ""pull out all the stops"" meaning offer as much stuff as possible to raise funds, especially since the holidays are right around the corner. So in the ""perks"" I'll be offering packages of greeting cards based on the 2 images below. One is a menorah shot on the 8th night of Chanukah rendered in my ""Implosions"" style, the other a winter shot of a pristine babbling brook and tiny waterfalls.

Imagine for a moment that you come home from work today and it's raining. Your husband/wife also arrives home and you all grab dinner with the kids. You turn on the news and see that a storm is hitting the area and things are expected to get much worse. You decide to stay home because there have been false alarms in the past and you have candles and batteries and all the stuff necessary, just ""in case."" 
And then the lights go out, and the wind picks up. Your 4-year-old daughter screams ""Daddy I'm scared"" from her room and you rush to calm her down. Suddenly a tree limb violently smashes into your living-room through a window, and as you go to the window to see the damage you notice that your car is floating away. 
Things are getting much worse. The water is rising and is now seeping under your front door. You decide to get some survival supplies from the basement, but as you open the basement door you realize that your basement is gone, totally flooded and the water is rising rapidly.
Water is now rushing in through all of your doors and rising towards the windows. Now you're scared, really scared. You live in a one floor home and you're kicking yourself that you never fixed the stairs to the crawlspace. The water in your home is now three feet high and rising and you realize that you have to leave, right now. The two of you grab your kids and rush out the front door together, clinging to one another and to a few air mattresses that were in the kids room. 
Moments after you wade into the rapidly moving water surge, the flotation you are clinging to is ripped away from you and you are all separated. You are moving at high speed in a torrent of water, refuse, trees and cars, and it is all going towards the Atlantic Ocean. 
What do you do now?
My full name is David Osterczy. I am a photographer and writer by trade, and I shoot photos and relate stories that I hope elicits passion in my readers. I am a father of 3 amazing kids, and I have a story to share with you. 
On October 29-30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast of the USA with a destructive force rarely seen in these parts. 15 foot waves repeatedly hit the shoreline in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The devastation, loss of life, and destruction of property was massive due to several factors:

1) It was a full moon that evening.
2) It was high tide when the brunt of the storm hit.
3) It was a category 1 hurricane, despite what they tell you. 
Several days after the storm I received a call from my friend, Bruce Spierer. Bruce is a young man committed to community service, in an organization we are both members of, MDI, which fosters service to mankind on many levels. 
Bruce implored me to come out and help on Staten Island, which was hit particularly hard, and to ""bring my men and anyone else willing to do the dirty work.""
We spent the entire next weekend gutting and tearing apart homes, from the ceilings to the sub-floors. The sheer amount of refuse from demolition that our team of 30 men and women created was unbelievable, 

yet it paled in comparison to what we saw being dumped on Midland  Beach by huge army  trucks. The pile was about 30 feet high, 300-400 feet long, and about 50 feet wide. This was the demolished remains of peoples homes and lives, and more was coming every hour. 

No-one could believe the sheer destruction. It truly looked like photos I've seen of third-world countries, yet here we were in New York City. 

Afterwards, I was useless until the following Wednesday because I hurt in places I didn't know I had, as did many of the members of our team. Here we are after day one. I'm the guy kneeling on the far right with the grey camo pants.

And we went right back the following weekend and most every weekend since. No accounting for intelligence, eh? 
This project is focused on the south shore of Staten Island, New York, and is the story of the families who lived through this horrific storm, some of whom barely survived, and all of whom lost everything they had. It will be told in ""storybook format"" directly from the mouths of those who lived it. All the passion, all the tears, terror, pain, and suffering that goes along with being a survivor of devastation. This story will also be told by the men and women who repeatedly put themselves in harm's way, the volunteers who refuse to give in to this day, and many days beyond until all these families are back in the homes that they love. What I and my team are committed to:
Complete this book and multimedia campaign to spread the word and raise awareness that hundreds upon hundreds of families are still not back in their homes, a full year since the storm ended. 

Raise $50,000.00+, to be able to dedicate myself full time to this project until it's completion (I already left my job. I am terrified and excited all at the same time!).

With this awareness and with non-profit aide, raise additional funding to assure that these families get the support that they need to rebuild safely, properly, and professionally. 

Donate a large portion of book sales to YellowBoots.org, a 501(c)3 not-for-profit that creates miracles across the country when any sort of disaster hits. They are true heroes in every sense of the word and I am proud to have worked shoulder to shoulder with them on many occasions. 
And that every single family featured in this book (and many others) are safely back in their homes. I may be repeating myself here, it is that important to us, and to them. 

 Why We Need Your Full Support!

To be able to do this correctly, we need a great videographer, video editor, book copy-editor, cover artist, amazing publisher (speaking to Outskirts Press and I really like them!), lots of equipment, and a super-staff to assist me with the hundreds of interviews compiling many, many of hours of difficult footage. 
Some discussed expenses we will incur are:
Professionally shot video @$150.00/hour X 100 hours = $15,000.00
Gas,Tolls, from The Bronx to Staten Island @ $30.00 per trip X 100 trips = $3000.00
Professional Video Editing (to be determined) and uploading all finished videos to a private YouTube account, accessible only with a login code. 
Selp Publication Package including PR, Book Cover, ebooks, etc. = $1500.00
Professional Copy Editor for book = $5000.00
These numbers can be minimized to a degree if we buy our own equipment, however that too is expensive! 
And of course there's the writing. So very much writing! If you've ever written a novel then you understand what a huge undertaking this is. Add the multi-media stuff, and, well, it's HUGE! Fortunately, this ain't my first rodeo, I've been published multiple times. 
Additionally, we must be careful where we park in Staten Island. These people do NOT fool around!
Okay, now seriously: 
Much of the money raised will go towards funding this project, however portions will immediately go towards supplies to assist the rebuilding effort. 

Public relations will need to be enhanced and involved through my publisher. 

A dedicated website upon completion of this campaign, for continued contributions through a 501(c)3 non-profit we are in negotiations with presently (it looks good and they love the idea!). 
And we need YOU to share this through social media with everyone that you know who cares about families, kids, and just great people in general. 

And if we fall short of our goal, the funds will come out of our pockets, where they have been coming from for nearly a year now. This will happen, no matter what! 


The Impact:
Just imagine yourself and your kids in this situation; you come home from work and it's windy and raining. No problem. You prepare dinner and notice that the lights are flickering and the wind seems a lot stronger. You look out the window and cars are floating by, some with people still in them.
The lights go out. Now you're scared. Suddenly water begins to seep into your front door. If you're very, very lucky you have a second level to go to, if not, what do you do? Your wife and kids scream as the waves bash in your front door and 7 feet of water fill your home in seconds. 
Why am I repeating myself? Because this has happened to the people featured in this book, and much worse. 

This project is only the beginning of a much larger idea.
Getting people to understand that there WILL be more storms similar to Sandy, and they will be coming more often than we are being told. 

Our small team has accomplished more than 1.5 million dollars in demolition, rebuilding, and fundraising over the past 11 months with no prior experience and no professional backing. Imagine what we can accomplish with your help? 

Nothing will stop us from attaining our goals.

What can you do to assist us? 


Other Ways You Can Help:
If you are not in position to help monetarily, please spread the word the best way that you know how. Social media is great for this, however word-of-mouth is amazingly effective! Please utilize the Indiegogo share tools to assist you in getting the word out! 
Please volunteer locally in your community. You have absolutely no idea how amazing it feels to be able to look in the mirror and KNOW that you made someone's life a little better today, tomorrow, and continue to do it! It is a truly empowering, incredible feeling! This work has changed my life, altered my focus, and all the volunteers I have had the honor to work with feel the same way! 

The above is a cartooned piece of my art showing the amount of particulate matter and dust that our crew breathed in every week over many months. This is what a fully-gutted home looks like, leaving only the floors intact. It is included as one of the offerings (perks) to your right. The image above was shot at New Dorp Beach on January 12, 2013. These were the very orange roots of one of many trees downed in Hurricane Sandy. So I may have mentioned that I'm an art-photographer? Well I created a style called ""Imploded Nature"" and this is what I created. It is by far my most popular selling image:It is entitled ""Hot Stalactites"" and is included in the ""perks"" to your right, signed and numbered as a gorgeous Gallery Plexi. Gallery Plexis are the most beautiful way to display fine art. You have to see one to believe how amazing they are. Many fine artists here in New York will only display in this format due to the incredible nature of the high quality printing, and gallery quality plexiglass utilized. 

Since I've never done anything like Indiegogo before, my friends have suggested that I ""pull out all the stops"" meaning offer as much stuff as possible to raise funds, especially since the holidays are right around the corner. So in the ""perks"" I'll be offering packages of greeting cards based on the 2 images below. One is a menorah shot on the 8th night of Chanukah rendered in my ""Implosions"" style, the other a winter shot of a pristine babbling brook and tiny waterfalls. They will be 10 - 5X7 cards (5 of each image) with envelopes all printed on metallic paper for amazing color and clarity. Your family and friends will display them proudly and may even frame them.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Story of My Book</h2>
<p>Zelenia &amp; The Heir to the Throne is a telenovela-inspired story of a brave princess who can pack more than a punch. With the looming decision that either she or her twin prince brother will inherit the throne, Princess Zelenia is met with rival royals, political secrets and emerging romance - while having to hide her lunar powers.</p>
<p><br/>My name is E.Diana and I am the author of Zelenia &amp; The Heir to the Throne. I wrote this book because I wanted to give Latines a fun, fresh slice of representation in a media world that otherwise depicts us negatively.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a coming-of-age story that has been long overdue in the Latin community. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with the re-imagined Caribbean islands, escape from reality to a world of dance and romance and learn alongside Zelenia about the importance of being true to yourself.<br/><br/>The Caribbean Monarchies have lived for centuries in harmony - that is, until the Cari War broke out. Princess Zelenia and her twin brother Celos were told as children that the Cari were just a fairytale, that these superpowered beings did not really exist among them. But when their mother vanished mysteriously, Zelenia discovered that she was the Moon Cari, and she had to keep it a secret for her own safety. Those who started the clash were still out there, and they want nothing more than to see all the Cari fall. The only people who share her mystery are her handmaiden Carmen, and her best friend, the servant boy Evander. She is isolated inside her palace without seeing much of the outside world aside from visiting the beach every night.<br/><br/>Zelenia longs to know what a normal life is like without royal duties, or uncontrollable celestial powers. The more she learns about the Cari, the stronger she becomes over time.<br/><br/>Once the twins turn 15, King Taveras rapidly makes plans for one of them to inherit the throne, causing tension between them. He deems Zelenia unfit for the throne and sends her away to finish school with the other Caribbean princesses. During this time, she develops feelings for one of the other princesses and deems herself bisexual. She enjoys her time there until two princesses discover her Cari identity and threaten her with blackmail.<br/><br/>Her father calls her back home on short notice. Upon returning, she meets Celos’ personal knight Fabian, who gives her an immediate negative vibe. She summons the courage to tell her father about her identity, which he rejects and shuts her down. Zelenia flags Evander and they run away together to the city, where their feelings for each other reach new heights and she is able to relish in the moment of being a normal girl for a night.<br/><br/>But it does not last long, and there is bad news awaiting her at home. The conflict for the throne reaches a new peak as the twins’ 18th birthday swiftly approaches. Zelenia must make a choice if she is to step up to the plate and become Queen, or continue hiding in the shadows of her family’s secrets.<br/><br/><br/>You will love this book if you want more Latine representation, coming-of-age stories, and enjoy classic telenovela plots.<br/><br/>Zelenia &amp; The Heir to the Throne speaks to the Latine community and young adults who want to grapple with identity and romance in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Zelenia &amp; The Heir to the Throne inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What really makes someone family?</li>
<li>Does the way King Taveras treats Zelenia after she comes out become a quality mirror for the Latine community to see how they treat their LGBT+ children?</li>
<li>Is having a high social status really all that it’s cracked up to be?</li>
</ul>

I wrote this book to inspire the rising leaders of today and transform them to become the thought leaders of tomorrow. A majority of us were taught to seek stability and status quo, but I’m here to remind us to reach for the stars and shoot for the moon... to reach that next level of potential we all have within us.<br/><br/>We can only grow by trusting ourselves and taking the opportunity to step outside of our comfort zone by approaching projects and initiatives in a way that could bring some much needed friction to your work space and career path. We want to take innovative calculated risks we can and could learn from rather than dream about later and what we wish we had done.<br/><br/>This book is meant for people who feel stuck, people who want to embrace their leadership mindset and potential. Based on the experiences and practices of myself and other leaders, you will learn to be fearless in times of change and innovative during moments of contentment. With stories from Fortune 500 leaders like Elon Musk to global entrepreneurs like Sara Blakely, you’ll discover your unique leadership mindset and how to stand out as a leader in your own environment.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your own thought leadership potential and use my proposed mindset framework to get started on your leadership journey. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with your internal coach, escape from the traditional management norms and learn about the importance of showing up as a leader for yourself and those around you.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy learning about leadership trends, best practices, and want to dig into the mindset of what other leaders, CEOs, and founders have experienced while building their empires.<br/><br/><i>Standing Out, While Blending</i> <i>In</i> speaks to managers wanting to grow as leaders and early career professionals who want to grapple with embracing a leadership mindset ahead of time that will allow you to grow in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Standing Out, While Blending In inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>How can I lead with more compassion rather than ego?</li>
<li>How does a leadership mindset impact not only the way we act, but also the behaviors of those around us?</li>
<li>Why it’s is it important to evolve the traditional hierarchical manager into a more collaborative thought leader?</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>I look forward to exploring these questions and more with my readers. I believe discussing purpose, trust, resilience and risk will change us all for the better.</p><p> </p><h2>The Book - Standing Out, While Blending In</h2><p> </p><p>The book is written in three parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> starts with a general understanding of what mindset is and why it’s important right now. You’ll learn about the science and psychology behind growth mindset from Dr. Carol Dweck, brain based research around mindset shared by Dr. David Rock, and Oprah Winfrey’s experiences growing up and how she chooses to view the world every day. We are living in an uncertain world and part 1 lets you find more certainty and be more accepting to the uncertain itself.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> breaks down the mindset strategy around your leadership journey. There are chapters in this section about understanding your purpose, building trust with yourself and those around you, enhancing resilience, and the power of taking risks. You’ll learn about my purpose journey and the journey of other famous companies and leaders. There are crucial elements of trust that you’ll learn about that will allow you to walk away and practice these skills in every day conversations; whether it’s understanding authenticity, becoming more empathetic, or practicing all 7 levels of active listening.

The other 50% will go towards future marketing efforts, as well as book promotion.As an Armenian in California, it has been a tragic few months seeing the pain my family and friends have been experiencing due to the attacks on Armenians in Artsakh. Schools, hospitals, churches and more than 2700 residential structures have been destroyed and damaged. To support my community and culture, this is the least I can do.  -Story of My Book Standing Out, While Blending In is about finding your own version of thought leadership and choosing to live with a growth mindset when leading yourself and a team in business and life.My name is Alex Abramian and I am the author of Standing Out, While Blending In. I wrote this book to inspire the rising leaders of today and transform them to become the thought leaders of tomorrow. A majority of us were taught to seek stability and status quo, but I’m here to remind us to reach for the stars and shoot for the moon... to reach that next level of potential we all have within us.We can only grow by trusting ourselves and taking the opportunity to step outside of our comfort zone by approaching projects and initiatives in a way that could bring some much needed friction to your work space and career path. We want to take innovative calculated risks we can and could learn from rather than dream about later and what we wish we had done.This book is meant for people who feel stuck, people who want to embrace their leadership mindset and potential. Based on the experiences and practices of myself and other leaders, you will learn to be fearless in times of change and innovative during moments of contentment. With stories from Fortune 500 leaders like Elon Musk to global entrepreneurs like Sara Blakely, you’ll discover your unique leadership mindset and how to stand out as a leader in your own environment.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your own thought leadership potential and use my proposed mindset framework to get started on your leadership journey. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with your internal coach, escape from the traditional management norms and learn about the importance of showing up as a leader for yourself and those around you.You will love this book if you enjoy learning about leadership trends, best practices, and want to dig into the mindset of what other leaders, CEOs, and founders have experienced while building their empires.Standing Out, While Blending In speaks to managers wanting to grow as leaders and early career professionals who want to grapple with embracing a leadership mindset ahead of time that will allow you to grow in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that Standing Out, While Blending In inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like: 
How can I lead with more compassion rather than ego?
How does a leadership mindset impact not only the way we act, but also the behaviors of those around us?
Why it’s is it important to evolve the traditional hierarchical manager into a more collaborative thought leader?
 I look forward to exploring these questions and more with my readers. I believe discussing purpose, trust, resilience and risk will change us all for the better. The Book - Standing Out, While Blending In The book is written in three parts.Part 1 starts with a general understanding of what mindset is and why it’s important right now. You’ll learn about the science and psychology behind growth mindset from Dr. Carol Dweck, brain based research around mindset shared by Dr. David Rock, and Oprah Winfrey’s experiences growing up and how she chooses to view the world every day. We are living in an uncertain world and part 1 lets you find more certainty and be more accepting to the uncertain itself.Part 2 breaks down the mindset strategy around your leadership journey. There are chapters in this section about understanding your purpose, building trust with yourself and those around you, enhancing resilience, and the power of taking risks. You’ll learn about my purpose journey and the journey of other famous companies and leaders. There are crucial elements of trust that you’ll learn about that will allow you to walk away and practice these skills in every day conversations; whether it’s understanding authenticity, becoming more empathetic, or practicing all 7 levels of active listening. There is also a chapter that tells you all about resilience where you will hear stories from my experiences, Abraham Lincoln, and learn an approach that will help you become more resilient. The last chapter in this section offers you stories and inspiration to have you look at risk-taking in a new way. In a way where calculated risks provide opportunities that you would have never thought of.Part 3 is more focused on how this mindset is applied and used in the real world. There are applied experiences and stories shared for early career professionals, hungry aspiring leaders, ambitious students who want to start early on the leadership track, and people who are feeling stuck in their career and want to start making changes for themselves. What I Need & What You'll Get This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Searching for the Sun is a journey teetering upon the question of “what happens when we die”, seen through the lens of two characters: Death and the dead. Happy and Book, bonded by their isolation, attempt to discover where the sun lives, for what are friends to do other than seek out a golden orb running across the sky? Yet love, in all its sincerity, cannot block the past, as The Man, Happy’s creator, follows the duo. He lays a trail of red flowers in the night, luring Happy back into manipulation’s threshold. Such intentional delusions often tangle the strings of love, yet the sun still keeps its incessant pattern of rise and set. It is through the help of Time, an ancient tortoise seeking atonement for her ill treatment towards Happy, that the friends are protected. But tortoises themselves follow a similar up and down of the sun, and Time might stutter just enough for The Man’s words to yet again attain their influence. <br/><br/>My name is Samantha Carter and I am the author of Searching for the Sun. I wrote this book as I struggled to understand the determination of death: the places we’ll go, the way it’ll happen, even the stereotypical personification of death followed an either sinful or melancholy trail. I wanted to do justice to these characters while simaltenously answering the question of “what happens?” <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that innocence can often be the weapon in which one may fight to retain themselves and what they love. It exists just next to their trauma. Walks alongside them. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to escape from the fear of the end and learn alongside Happy and Book about the importance of love and trust. <br/> </p>

<li>We buy <strong>ONE MILLION</strong> plastic water bottles a <strong>MINUTE</strong>.</li>

<p>Last winter, I was strolling on an icy beach near my parents' house in Newfoundland with my two young nephews. I stopped every few paces to pull bottles, scraps of plastic bags, and other shreds of debris from the rocks.<br/><br/>I explained to the boys, who had expressed curiosity, that I was collecting the trash to help save the plants and animals from getting sick or trapped. They considered this explanation for a moment,  then began collecting six-pack rings and bottle caps in their small mittens.<br/><br/>As we walked and worked, we paused every few minutes to take in a soaring bald eagle, a cresting whale, or an ice-pan heavy with seals. Jace (aged 5) pointed out a colony of whirring gulls, and Ben (aged 3) eyed a romp of playful otters against the backdrop of sea ice, twisted evergreens, and glistening black kelp.</p>
<p>""But . . . what happens if we miss some?"" pondered Jace, spotting a single bobbing harbour seal. He examined his plastic-laden mittens, then looked to the seal again. <i>What if we miss some.</i></p>

<h3>HOW YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p>I want to share ""Blueberry Bay"" with as many children as possible, to spread the word about something so critically important and time-sensitive - because kids aren't just the future, they're the present, too. They, too, are responsible for making decisions that coud help save the sea.</p>

Jace (aged 5) pointed out a colony of whirring gulls, and Ben (aged 3) eyed a romp of playful otters against the backdrop of sea ice, twisted evergreens, and glistening black kelp.
""But . . . what happens if we miss some?"" pondered Jace, spotting a single bobbing harbour seal. He examined his plastic-laden mittens, then looked to the seal again. What if we miss some.


HOW YOU CAN HELP
I want to share ""Blueberry Bay"" with as many children as possible, to spread the word about something so critically important and time-sensitive - because kids aren't just the future, they're the present, too. They, too, are responsible for making decisions that coud help save the sea.
My goal is to self-publish an illustrated storybook version of ""Blueberry Bay"" - but in order to do this, I will need to raise funds in advance to pay for illustrations, publication, editing, printing, and and distribution of my book.
If I'm fortunate enough to exceed my target, excess funds will be used to plan and fund an educational book and concert tour of schools, clubs, and libraries.

We know they have more than that. So why haven’t they created that book? How can they know people will want their work?
 
The Kindle Kode takes them by the hand, and gives them the methods to satisfy that desire to create, find their audience, and thrive.
 
What is the Kindle Kode Project?
 
It is our five step system, delivered in multi-media, comprised of 5 distinct sections, delivered in 30 day increments, similar to taking a full course over several months. Here’s a short breakdown:
 
Kindle Kode ebook
 
A condensed digital book that guides you through all the steps to writing and publishing your own ebooks on Amazon’s Kindle platform. You will learn how to research and determine what readers who share your interests and passions search for, and what they buy. Kindle Kode students will focus on those readers to determine exactly what they want. The Kindle Kode ebook can transform students from wishing they can write and publish, to publishing their first (or many) books, that readers want to buy.
 
Advanced Techniques eBook
 
After studying the Kindle Kode ebook, learning how, what and who to write and publish for, next you will learn the techniques to find your audience and maximize your research, satisfy the readers and achieve your own goals and accomplishment.
 
Live webinar with Joel Comm
 
Subject. “How can I transform my past habits of writing, into this Kindle Kode system to provide income, for me and my family?” This live webinar will be available to all students and future members of the Kindle Kode Project. In addition to live coaching during the webinar, live Q&A will be included, providing advice and questions answered.
 
Custom Publishing Programs
 
For students who choose the advanced levels of our training, personal one on one guidance, coaching, and helping students publish their first ebooks in the Amazon Kindle Store will be offerred. The 2 Custom Publishing Programs differ in service level. One program consists of extensive step by step personal advice, to assist the students formatting and submitting their ebooks for Kindle publishing approval. The premium ""done for you"" program provides a complete turn key service, with the student furnishing their original edited manuscript to Joel's team. The team performs all steps, design, cover creation, formatting, submission to Amazon Kindle for approval and publishing. Of course, these invitations will be limited. We want to make publishing students' books a great success.
 
Our goal with the Kindle Kode Project:
 
For as many as will take action, apply our training and desire results, we will help members of the Kindle Kode Project write, publish, maintain and build successful writing opportunities and careers.
 
Thank You
 
To all the Backers of this project, we appreciate your role in standing with us, helping to create a path for aspiring writers to transform their ideas into books that will be published and read by their unique audience. Ideas without appropriate actions are vapor. Thank you for helping us build those ideas, and create something remarkable.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Revelation Before Rehabilitation is a Publishing Company and movement founded by author Kristopher Holbert. Mr. Holbert began working on RB4R when he realized the lack of positive and ethical material being highlighted in not only urban communities, but in many other lower income areas across America as well. He coined the term “Revelation Before Rehabilitation” upon the organization’s creation to raise awareness of the lack of prevention-based life skills programs in America, despite the enormous amounts of money being pumped into rehabilitation programs of all sorts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With a long family history of brute convicts and drug addicts, Holbert understands the country’s infatuation with rehabilitation. As most Americans know, statistically it is easier to track, allocate, and explain on paper the success and failure rate of a person once they are numbered, categorized, and designated to confinement. It is far more “efficient” than spending money on classes and programs that promote morality and ethics in a free society, which cannot be scrutinized as closely in areas that have high crime rates and low educational scores.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At RB4R we believe that every person is not created equal when it comes to understanding the true moral sense of what it is to be an American without financial or material relevance consuming your life. We believe that when a person is more appreciative of life and made aware of their significance to society, that person is more likely to invest into who they are. Moreover, they will build up (or Rebuild) where they are from when that philosophy is in line with what they stand for. When people have true stock in a community they are less likely to require government assistance or interference. The problem with this vision is this understanding must be gained and taught. The solution is people like you and I (especially those of us who originated in these areas) making contributions of time, finances, and energy to make sure that every person no matter their background has an understanding and sense of value in their personal worth and relevance. RB4R not only promotes you to appreciate you but also is dedicated to providing the Life Skills and a wealth of wisdom and knowledge to those in need, specializing in everything from literacy material to workshops, coaching and so much more.

<div> </div>
<div>I've been on the front lines of this movement for a number of years and one way positive change is happening is through open source programs, platforms, and philosophies. The movement is called: open government.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As many have, I found a powerful way to blend my passion for open source, local community, and civic participation in the open government movement. Along the way, I've met many civic-minded 'geeks' like me who have stepped up to advocate for a more open and transparent government.</div>

<p>In my book, I explore what it means to be an open source city using Raleigh, North Carolina as an example.

<h3>Shortly after starting at a new school 13-year old Henry falls in love with a girl in the grade above him. Too shy to confess his feelings to her openly, he watches her from a distance... until he gets a chance which sets off an unlucky chain of events.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>My name is Richard Rothkugel and I am an aspiring writer. I started writing seriously in 2010 and have written two books (unpublished) and a few short stories since then. In 2012 I completed my Masters in Creative Writing from the Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane. </p>
<p>I wrote Young Boy's Heart in the span of two weeks in 2012 for the The Australian/Vogel's Literary Award for young writers, a prestigious writing competition hosted by Allen and Unwin Publishing House and the Australian Newsagency. I did not win and neither was I shortlisted, but I felt that the novella I had written was the first piece of my work I wanted to share with the world. Since then I've spent a year editing and polishing it for self-publishing.</p>
<p>This crowd-funding campaign is important to me because I want to deliver a story of the highest quality that is enjoyable to read and memorable. I think my writing has something to offer the world and I want to share it with everyone.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>The funding for the campaign will go to costs involved with self-publishing a short novella.</p>
<p>Of the $1130 dollars, $580 will go to a professional editor and proof-reader. Although I have proof-read and edited the manuscript myself I want to make absolutely sure that it is in as near to perfect condition as I can get it.  To this end I will require the services of an editing professional.</p>
<p>$440 dollars will go to creating a personal website for myself and small section for each of my upcoming books/works, including Young Boy's Heart. This will allow me to further advertise my work and create a central area where readers can access information and hear about upcoming news and projects.</p>
<p>A small percentage (4% or 9%) of the total funding will go to indiegogo, as per their terms, and the remaining money will go to miscelleneous costs such as hosting and domain registration (up to $50 for 2 years).</p>
<p>The amounts above are in Australian dollars so the exchange rate must also be considered.</p>
<p>The perks for this campaign centre around the final product, a PDF and/or eBook version of the novella. For every level of funding a contributor will receive both with the PDF/eBook versions. Silver will receive digital Letters of Thanks along with copies of Young Boy's Heart. Gold supporters will receive hand-written Letters of Thanks personally addressed to their shipping address.</p>
<p>I intend to sell the novella for $1 on Amazon.com, so I think it is only right to give everyone who contributes a copy of work. That being said, all contributions are sincerely valued.</p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal the funding will be prioritised according the most critical components for online publishing. This would be the editor/proof-reader first and then anythng left over would be put toward the website. </p>
<p>Young Boy's Heart is already written and whether or not the funding goal is met, every contributor will receive a copy. The funding is purely for the level of polish the final product will have.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Beyond Young Boy's Heart</h3>
<p>I love reading and I love stories. Before I wrote Young Boy's Heart I wrote two other books, one of which is a fantasy novel I am rewriting for self-publishing and the other is a martial arts manual (which still needs a little work). Beside these (almost) complete works I have many other projects  that I am working on. </p>
<p>I enjoy writing and I'm passionate about it, but I'm not delusional enough (yet!) to think that I could do it full time and get a living salary from it. I'm still a student and these crowd-funding projects help me publish my work while still being able to eat and live. </p>
<p>I write in my free time and every dollar helps me spend less time working for a living and allows me to devote more time to my writing projects.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Sharing is caring</h3>
<p>If you like my work and would like me to write more, please share it with your friends or direct them to this campaign. Writing and publishing is tough without support and even sharing a few simple words like ""Have you seen this book?"" could mean the difference between being able to publish this novella.</p>
<p>There are also many in-built sharing tools that Indiegogo has to offer which may be invaluable for this campaign to reach its funding goal. </p>

<h2 style=""margin-left: 150px;"">Young Boy's Heart</h2>
<p>      My brother was a strange boy. He had no friends at school and had spent forty-two days trying to talk to a girl he had fallen in love with. For the first twenty of those days I had closely monitored his failed attempts. But after twenty days I could no longer bear to watch.</p>
<p>      In the morning as we drove to school, I would turn around and see him staring out the window. His breath fogged up the dirty glass of our old car and his eyes were empty. I didn’t know at that time, but what I was seeing was the face of unrequited love. A love not acknowledged or returned in kind. The melancholy surrounding him was palpable. It made me sad to watch him. When I tried to cheer him up, he would simply hang his head.</p>
<p>      My brother was young, barely caressed by the curse of puberty, and small for his age. His features were delicate, almost feminine. Not a single freckle stained his face but a single deep scar hovered above his left eye like an upturned moon. In the morning-sun his eyes were a crystal blue and as the sun set beyond the horizon they would turn a deep green. He was growing his hair long. It was a light auburn colour any little girl could envy and would often get him mistaken as a little girl himself. This is how I remembered my brother... </p>

<p>It's time to change the conversation about Pakistan.</p>
<p>Tanqeed is an experiment in critical reflection. It is a quarterly e-zine that publishes long form journalism and essays that analyze contemporary Pakistan and South Asia. We think, we write, we report and we analyze the stories that the mainstream media won't cover. </p>
<p>We are a crop of young Pakistanis who are, frankly, quite bored with the mainstream narrative about Pakistan as a country of total violence -- a failed state with a wretched history and no future. In our experience as journalists, academics and writers, that story is neither interesting nor accurate. We aim for critical analyses that dissect a range of issues without falling into a narrative of hopelessness. And we are developing a conversation that is multi-lingual: Tanqeed's issues are published in English and Urdu.

We publish 4 issues per year with single-standing essays, reporting and multimedia work published in-between each issue. Our longterm goal is to develop a public place for hard-hitting, in-depth reporting as well as intellectual and lively discussion about our complicated present.  </span></p>

It's time to change the conversation about Pakistan.
Tanqeed is an experiment in critical reflection. It is a quarterly e-zine that publishes long form journalism and essays that analyze contemporary Pakistan and South Asia. We think, we write, we report and we analyze the stories that the mainstream media won't cover. 
We are a crop of young Pakistanis who are, frankly, quite bored with the mainstream narrative about Pakistan as a country of total violence -- a failed state with a wretched history and no future. In our experience as journalists, academics and writers, that story is neither interesting nor accurate. We aim for critical analyses that dissect a range of issues without falling into a narrative of hopelessness. And we are developing a conversation that is multi-lingual: Tanqeed's issues are published in English and Urdu. You can check out the first 5 here. 
From observations on politics, culture and media to video, audio and multimedia, TQ takes account of a country that has hitherto been overtaken by its representations. We publish 4 issues per year with single-standing essays, reporting and multimedia work published in-between each issue. Our longterm goal is to develop a public place for hard-hitting, in-depth reporting as well as intellectual and lively discussion about our complicated present.  
We've already had a spate of wonderful writers working with us: Mohammed Hanif, Saadia Toor, Muhammad Idrees Ahmad, Preeti Chopra, Ammar Ali Jan, William J. Glover, Jakob Steiner, Abira Ashfaq, Aasim Sajjad Akhtar, Dr. Allah Nazar Baloch, Matthew Green, Ziyad Faisal, Malik Siraj Akbar, Sunaina Maira, Magid Shihade, Majed Akhtar, Daanish Mustafa, Badar Alam and Taymiya R. Zaman.
We also produced an unrivaled multimedia map for our elections issue. 
Issue 5: Space
Issue 4: Onwards Pakistan ~ The Elections Issue
Issue 3: Solidarity Politics
Issue 2: After the Floods
Issue 1: Room for Debate ~ On Malala Yousafzai
We've come a long way since our first issue in last November about Malala Yousafzai. Our latest issue, about space, borders and boundaries can speak to that. We now feature more original artwork and photography and more multimedia work including audio interviews and slideshows. But, there's still a lot more to do. So, contribute and help us build a better conversation.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Velociriot! was conceived of by Reed and Samantha, two best friends who wanted to focus on creating a blogging project together. That initial idea transformed into this website, where posts are made on an almost daily basis that analyze and critique culture, politics, history, and more. Currently, Velociriot! boasts an unpaid staff of 10, all of whom bring different experiences and backgrounds to the table. Subject matter in posts ranges from cultural appropriation to musical empowerment to feminist and LGBT* issues from across the board. Whether we're focusing on political headaches that should have been avoided, Twitter accounts that we think you should check out, gossip rags that are getting it all wrong, or food and drink recipes that will make your stomach grumble, we'll always bring the most up-to-date, relevant and interesting content to the web that we can find.</p>
<p>Now that the site is approaching its one-year anniversary, we're seeking to improve on everything we do currently. We'll be revamping the entire site with a design from talented web designer Caro Griffin, inviting friends and peers to contribute even more diverse opinions, interviewing various people whose views align with our mission statement, and improving the site on a daily basis. We are also seeking to introduce a physical zine, products that make statements and empower our audience, and more. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here's the deal. Our fundraising goal for this campaign is $500. That money will be broken down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$125 will got to Caro Griffin for redesigning and restructuring the site, as well as moving all of our  content from our current server (WordPress) to a new server that will provide us better bandwidth and more control.</li>
<li>$100 will go to the first year of hosting on our new server. Moving from WordPress will allow us to avoid fees, have more bandwidth, and exercise greater control over our content, advertising, and more.</li>
<li>$50-$75 will go to advertising on social media sites like Facebook. These advertisements will help us drive site traffic and get more views, which will increase our visibility and help us raise the issues we discuss to a higher level.</li>
<li>The remaining money ($200-$225) will be dedicated to creating products that <em>you </em>can purchase, which will help us sustain the site from this point forward! We'll be producing a physical zine, posters, t-shirts, stickers, and more. Our goal is to get several artists involved to appeal to multiple tastes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For every donation level, there are perks! We'll be giving away free copies of our first zine, free stickers, virtual hugs, endless thanks, and maybe some lollipops. We want to reward you for helping us out! So in addition to our eternal gratitude, you'll get some cool stuff, too.</p>
<p>If we do not meet our goal of $500, the money we do raise will go toward whatever we can afford from the list above. Hopefully, we can make up the difference some other way. But if we reach our goal, we'd be immeasurably happy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Velociriot! has already been publishing since mid-2012, and we've created a unique niche in online discussion. We mix together Buzzfeed's up-to-the-minute pop culture, Tumblr's social justice perspective, and traditional journalistic practices. From breaking down how ""Peeta Mellark is the Ophelia to Katniss Everdeen's Hamlet"" to reporting on sexual harassment in nightclubs, Velociriot is political and pop culture news for millennials that's actually written by them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate but you're a fan of the site, or you like what we're doing, you can help by promoting this campaign and the site itself! Thanks to our brilliant new social media manager, our Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr accounts are updated constantly with links to new posts, news about the site, and relevant subject matter.</p>
<p>By sharing this campaign with your friends and family on these social networking sites, you'll be helping us to get the word out so that we can continue to expand and grow, providing news, criticism and more on a regular basis. Check out the share tools down below and stay tuned! We'll be keeping you updated as the campaign progresses to let you know what's up. Thanks and keep rioting!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The do not like the fact that our democracy has turned into a plutocracy, and that our government has devloved into a system of legalized bribery.</p>
<p>They think that there is so much money involved that they are powerless to do anything about it.</p>
<p>That used to be true, but now, <a class=""link external"" href=""http://stupidtuesday.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stupid Tuesday</a> provides a <em>simple and effective</em> way to fight back.</p>

<h3>Please Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The site took over a year to create and was totally funded by personal savings and credit cards. Therefore, any amount you can donate will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Like any website with (hopefully) a large number of members, there is always a LOT of work that needs to be done. And doing all of this work on nights and weekends while holding down a full-time job and trying to have some kind of ""life"" is not only extremely difficult but decidedly unrealistic.</p>
<p>Also appreciated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feedback on the site.</li>
<li>Help spreading the word. (Anything you can do here will be greatly appreciated.)</li>
<li>Help with managing the large amounts of data we need to deal with. (No specail skills are needed for this - honesty, integrity, and the desire to help others are sufficient.)</li>
<li>Add SellOuts to the site. Become an investigative reporter and shed some light on how our so-called <em>representatives</em> have been selling themselves to the highest bidder just so they can remain in office (or become a lobbyist after they leave Congress).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Notes About Contributions</h3>
<p>1) We use PayPal, but you do *not* have to be a member or even join PayPal in order to contribute.</p>
<p>You can donate as a ""guest"" using any major credit card - simply uncheck the box labelled ""<em>Save this information with a PayPal account</em>"" at the bottom of the form. This option makes it just like using your credit card on any other website.</p>
<p>2) We list a goal of $6,000 because you have to do that when you set up an Indiegogo account. If we meet that goal we get to keep a larger percentage of the money raised; if we don't, we get less. (This is to discourage everyone from simply saying they'd like to raise a million dollars and is a fair policy.)</p>
<p>Rest assured that we can use more than that amount. $6000 won't even keep us afloat to the Novemember elections, and it pales in comparison to the <em>billions of dollars</em> that special interests spend buying... er, lobbying our Congress every single year.</p>
<h3> Thank You</h3>

Like any website with (hopefully) a large number of members, there is always a LOT of work that needs to be done. And doing all of this work on nights and weekends while holding down a full-time job and trying to have some kind of ""life"" is not only extremely difficult but decidedly unrealistic.
Also appreciated:

Feedback on the site.
Help spreading the word. (Anything you can do here will be greatly appreciated.)
Help with managing the large amounts of data we need to deal with. (No specail skills are needed for this - honesty, integrity, and the desire to help others are sufficient.)
Add SellOuts to the site. Become an investigative reporter and shed some light on how our so-called representatives have been selling themselves to the highest bidder just so they can remain in office (or become a lobbyist after they leave Congress).



Notes About Contributions
1) We use PayPal, but you do *not* have to be a member or even join PayPal in order to contribute.
You can donate as a ""guest"" using any major credit card - simply uncheck the box labelled ""Save this information with a PayPal account"" at the bottom of the form. This option makes it just like using your credit card on any other website.
2) We list a goal of $6,000 because you have to do that when you set up an Indiegogo account. If we meet that goal we get to keep a larger percentage of the money raised; if we don't, we get less. (This is to discourage everyone from simply saying they'd like to raise a million dollars and is a fair policy.)
Rest assured that we can use more than that amount. $6000 won't even keep us afloat to the Novemember elections, and it pales in comparison to the billions of dollars that special interests spend buying... er, lobbying our Congress every single year.

“For though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again” -Proverbs 24:16 NIVMany people go on to accomplish great things but many don’t. The fact is most people live and die without ever scratching the surface of what they were put on this earth to do because of a moral failure, an addiction holding them back, a divorce that plagues them for years to come, or living a compromised life with little character or integrity. The purpose of this book is to equip people with a spiritual and practical plan to help them Get Up from devastating circumstances and fulfill their God-given destiny.



The Author

I've been in ministry, church marketing, and graphic design for over 15 years with some bible college training at The King’s College and Seminary under the direction of Dr. Jack Hayford.  I’ve served as a youth pastor, college pastor, & a creative pastor. I have had the amazing opportunity to see God move in the lives of so many people and am blown away at how He continues to change people from the inside out.On the other side of the spectrum over the years, I have experienced the bondage of sexual addiction and substance abuse and have found freedom in both areas! I’ve been through two substance abuse treatment centers and a sexual addiction recovery program. I’ve been to counselors and have been a counselor from a pastoral role for many years and am very familiar with the shame and guilt people live in on a daily basis. I feel this book can help them on the road to restoration because not only have I been where they are but I am a living example of how this process can change lives.


The Impact
Getting Up is the story, the process that helped bring me freedom, and the biblical principles that helped me grow into the person God has called me to be. I believe that each person's story is unique and distinctly different but the principles and process of restoration are the same. My belief is that this process can help bring freedom to people worldwide.

<p><a href=""http://www.theneerdowell.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Ne'er-Do-Well</a> is an independent literary magazine based in Portland, Oregon. Since 2008, we've published ""misfit lit"": stories and essays that explore the ironically universal experience of being the odd one out. We value prose that is well-developed, character-driven, and empathetic, and we value authors who are as obsessed as we are with the craft of writing.</p>
<h2>What’s Next for The Ne’er-Do-Well…</h2>
<p>After publishing three print issues of The Ne'er-Do-Well, we've decided to transition into an online literary community. We'll publish long-form stories and essays, and we'll have a blog dedicated to the craft of writing. We're raising funds for the design, development, and artwork for a new website.</p>
<p><strong>Curious to know what the new site will look like? Watch the video above to see a wireframe presentation.</strong></p>
<h2>How Will This Be Better? We're So Glad You Asked!</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sustainability—of Time, Money, and Passion.</strong> We believe that a web-based publishing platform is a more sustainable model for us. We'll be able to quit doing those things that cost a lot of money and don't excite us—such as layout, printing, and trips to the post office—and instead focus on what <em>does</em> excite us: Stories! And lots of 'em!</li>
<li>
<strong>Increased Production.</strong> With our new website, we'll be able to publish more stories, by more authors, more frequently. The Ne'er-Do-Well will be a vibrant, active space with lots of fresh content to tickle the eyeballs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Increased Visibility &amp; Reach.</strong> While a printed, physical book is a delight for readers and writers alike, web-based content is just so much easier to share. With our new website, we'll be able to reach more readers, and give writers the satisfaction of knowing their work will reach a wide audience.</li>
<li>
<strong>Awesome Look, Feel &amp; Functionality.</strong> Finally, we can be smart <em>and</em> pretty, thanks to Kim Genly of <a href=""http://christianlabansky.com/works-on-paper/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PIXELovely</a> Web Design and Development, who has created a customized web design that is tailored to our specific goals and audience. The color palette will carry over (with minor changes) from the existing site (grey + blue + rust), but will have an updated logo and will feature brand-new illustrations from Portland artist <a href=""http://christianlabansky.com/works-on-paper/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Christian Labansky</a>.</li>
</ul><h2>What Will We Do with Our IndieGoGo Funds?</h2>
<p>Funds raised will pay the cost of web development, graphic design, and illustration. If we raise additional funds beyond our goal, we'll squirrel them away to ensure the future health of the organization.  </p>
<h2>Details About Perks</h2>
<p>We're offering three different types of perks to our donors: product, participation, and editing.</p>
<h3><strong>Product Perks:</strong></h3>
<p><em>Issue #1 ($20 donation): </em>Our first print issue features stories and essays by Laura Bogart, Ryan Davidson, Allan Shapiro, Keith Rosson, Ricardo Perin, and Jon Lasser, with cover art by Dan Miller.</p>
<p><em>Issue #2 ($20 donation): </em>Our second print issue features stories and essays by Lacey Jane Henson, Stephen D. Kelly, Eve Rosenbaum, Kara Weiss, Dan Moreau, Jane Rosenberg LaForge, and Maggie Morgan, with cover art by Jonathan David Hanh Vu Hill.</p>
<p><em>Issue #3: Working-Class Stories ($20 donation)*: </em>This themed issue features working-class stories, essays, and comics from Willy Vlautin, Kevin Sampsell, Suzanne Burns, Gigi Little, Chris A. Bolton, Sheila Ashdown, Megan Zabel, Daniel Hall, Christina Mackin, Jill Holtz, and John Gifford, with cover art by Christina Mackin.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong><em>Please note</em>: Issue #3 was published as a fundraiser for ILWU Local 5. For every copy of this issue that is chosen as a perk, The Ne'er-Do-Well will donate $5 to the Local. (P.S. Support independent booksellers!)</p>
<h3><strong>Participation Perks:</strong></h3>
<p>Donors who opt for our “participation” perks—i.e., the opportunity to write either a one-line story ($10 donation) or a guest blog post ($40 donation)—have creative license to submit anything that strikes their fancy, as long as it's related to the craft of writing. Guest blog posts may include self-publicity (i.e., go ahead and give a shout-out to your new book, website, etc.), but keep the content relevant to an audience of literary readers and writers. These perks carry no expiration date.</p>
<p><em>A note on editorial standards</em>: All submitted work will be held to The Ne’er-Do-Well’s general editorial standards. Which basically means have some taste and be civil. We don't expect this to be a problem, but just to be safe, let's cover our bases and spell it out: We reserve the right to reject submitted work, or request a rewrite, if said work promotes any of the isms (sexism, racism, etc.), is pornographic, propaganda, or poorly written. All work will receive a basic copyedit, but submitters are expected to turn in prose that is as polished as possible.</p>
<h3><strong>Editorial Perks:</strong></h3>
<p>Donors who opt for our editorial perks—i.e., critique of either a short piece (story, essay, or chapter up to a max word count of 5,000 -- $100 donation) or a full-length manuscript (max 80K words --$350 donation)—will receive editorial critique in the form of a reader's report.</p>
<p>Reader's reports are performed by Sheila Ashdown, who is managing editor of The Ne’er-Do-Well in addition to being a full-time freelance editor with nine years of related experience. You’re welcome to check out <a href=""http://www.sheilaashdown.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sheila’s website</a> to learn more about reader's reports and see Sheila's work samples and resume. Sheila’s areas of expertise are fiction, personal development, and health and wellness. She welcomes prose of all variety (No poetry—sorry!), but if you’ve got something really obscure, you should probably shoot her an email (sheila@theneerdowell.com) before you commit to purchasing the perk. If she feels she would not be a good editor for your work, she’ll let you know.</p>
<p>Also, please be aware that Sheila reserves the right to decline to edit writing that promotes any of the isms (sexism, racism, etc.), or is propaganda. She will probably consent to edit writing that is pornographic or poorly written, but will feel embarrassed for you both. Donors’ manuscripts will be handled in the order in which they’re received; if a wait list forms, Sheila will keep donors updated regarding wait time, and will do her damndest to return manuscripts in a timely fashion. These perks carry no expiration date.</p></div>","About The Ne'er-Do-Well

By publishing StageWhispers, we hope to inspire other young artists to use creativity as a tool for transformation, and to explicate viBe's pedagogy, that is, the unique way that the viBe ""experience"" uncovers and nurtures the powerful voices of teenage girls in New York City.</p>
<p><strong><em>StageWhispers</em></strong> features over 30 of viBegirls and viBeAlumnae’s monologues and scenes.  Once it is published, a broad and diverse audience of youth, adults, teaching artists educators and avid readers can see through the lense of the urban teenage girl and enjoy pieces that offer a mix of humor, hardship, realism, idealism, hopefulness and celebration.  Readers can experience Alexandra's  discovery that her beauty and self-esteem extend beyond the contents of “a Fabulaxer perm bottle""  and journey with Unique as she challenges her father to take a more positive role in her life. They will smile and nod in agreement as they read Genna’s  humourous monologue about using “call waiting” to show her sister how to let go of a love gone wrong, and read with suspense throughout Brittney's haunting exploration of  a young man “on the down low” who is waiting for the results of his first HIV test.</p>
<p>We’ve aimed to make <strong><em>StageWhispers </em></strong>friendly to the young artist – just like our creative processes– by featuring supplementary quotes and tips from established female artists and <em>“An Artist’s Life”</em> section sharing youth-driven information and resources for readers who want to create their own work.</p>
<p>When you contribute to our IndieGoGo campaign, you will help to make this resource guide and archival collection of writing available to the general public.  It will help us to reach urban teen girls across the country, to spread our pedagogy, our methodology, and perhaps most importantly, give voice to some of the talented young women who have worked with us over the years.</p>
<p>As you know, publishing and printing a book is an expensive venture, costing thousands of dollars.  We’re pursuing individual and grant funding to help make <strong><em>StageWhispers</em></strong> a reality.  Your generous donation at any level - $25, $50, $100 $500 – or anywhere in between will help us to reach our $3,000 goal and bring viBe’s spirited work to the masses.  Please join us in bringing this viBrant book alive!</p>

As viBe has grown and evolved, we’ve come to consider ourselves not only a resource for teen artists – one that empowers them artistically, amplifies their voices and encourages them to speak out on current social issues; but also as a model for arts educators seeking to engage youth through the performing arts. 
This year, to celebrate our 10th Anniversary, we plan to self-publish, print and sell StageWhispers: viBe Monologues, Poetry & More by Teenage Girls, our first book of original monologues and poetry written by teenage girls from New York City. This collection features the writing of viBe girls who address issues critical to them, and to youth around the country.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Story of my Book</span></h3>
<p><i>Youth Organizer</i> is a book about how young people can build more powerful digital-first communities.<br/><br/>My name is Ashley Lin and I am the author of Youth Organizer. I wrote this book because after the pandemic started and schools went online, I felt incredibly disconnected from the clubs and communities I belonged to at school — and I know many of my peers felt the same way. Without the hallway conversations, lunch meetings, and other in-person connections of convenience, it was really hard to stay connected with people and accomplish everything that we had wanted to do. I wanted to help young people adapt our communities online and continue creating impact together.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to build powerful online communities. You’ll discover that not only is it possible for thriving digital communities to be created online, there are common building blocks to these communities and a battle-tested process that the best community builders follow. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for cultivating communities and building spaces of belonging and power online. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you build digital communities where you feel like you belong, are cared for, and gain increased agency over the future of your own life and the world around you.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how community building has evolved, the building blocks and processes for building thriving online communities, and how you can apply these principles to create your own. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>How Civics Unplugged has cultivated a youth-led, digital-first community of Gen Z “civic superheroes” leading a 10-year campaign called Civics 2030 to build democracy around the world</li>
<li>How Project Exchange’s Digital Exchange Program went from a Slack channel with hundreds of students and absolute silence, to a real community where students feel excited and empowered to organize their own events</li>
<li>How #BuiltByGirls scaled and sustains a community that prepares thousands of young women and non-binary students to step boldly into careers powered by technology</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you want to make your school club, student organization, youth-led non-profit, or simply your friend group more community-like.<br/><br/>Youth Organizer is a nonfiction book that speaks to community-spirited young leaders and adult supporters who want to cultivate thriving digital communities that builds belonging and power online.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book - Youth Organizer</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts...</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong> How We Got Here: Introduction + chapters 1-3<br/>We’ll start by diving into what exactly a community is, the history and evolution of online communities, and why online communities are now more important than ever. We follow the journey of how youth-led nonprofits such as Girl Genius rejected transactional team dynamics and built real community that empowers their team members, and explore how youth activists have leveraged digital communities to power movements such as March for our Lives and #FridaysForFuture.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> Building Blocks of Digital Communities: Chapters 4-12<br/>Here we use organizations like Civics Unplugged, Project Exchange, and #BuiltByGirls as case studies to dig deeper and map the building blocks and community-building processes they share. Each chapter is guided by a key question such as “What are the qualities of a good community builder?” and “What technologies can help with building digital communities?” or provocations like “leading with love” and “decentralizing power.” These chapters cover everything from establishing a why and finding your people to curating aesthetics and vibe.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> Cultivating Your Community: Chapters 13-15<br/>In the final section we’ll explore how you can apply the building blocks and processes shared in Part 2 to change culture and make your existing groups more community-like, start communities of your own, and power social change. We look at how leaders of the communities spotlighted above actually started their community building journeys, what you can do today to become a better community builder, and the gentle experiments you can introduce to help your group become a community and realize its full potential.</p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Perros en el tintero</strong> es una novela escrita por y para perros… si los perros supieran leer y escribir.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Noemí es una persona curiosa que destaca por sus ideas políticamente incorrectas. Entre ellas la de adoptar a Joana sin una intención convencional. Joana trata de averiguar por qué ha sido adoptada pero la curiosa profesión de Noemí es tan absorbente que incluso la atañe a ella: es guardería canina en su propio domicilio y tener una media de diez perros en casa de día y de noche le resultará un verdadero quebradero de cabeza que Noemí ve como la razón de su vida.<br/>          Joana no tiene ni idea de perros, pero se verá forzada a aprender y decidir si esa es la vida que quiere tener porque tener un perro es normal.<br/>          Tener dos demuestra que te gustan.<br/>          Tres es el límite de la locura.<br/>          Pero el ingente número que controla Noemí es un arca complicada de llevar si no sabes cómo hacerlo… Y aunque sepas cómo, a veces también necesitas un poco de instinto que te guíe entre los pelos del sofá y las patas embarradas dispersadas por la moqueta de un día lluvioso.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia</strong> es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionales pero de indudable calidad, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para promocionar cada título cuando esta todavía se encuentra en proceso de edición.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy te presentamos a <strong>Tania Canento</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nacida en Pamplona, seguramente la encuentres allí o en medio del monte con sus perros. Tras pasar la ESO sin pena ni gloria vio en la FP de autoedición que podía hacerlo mejor y empezó bachiller artístico sin saber muy bien qué estaba haciendo pero lo aprobó y con esa base metió el hocico en todo lo que tuviera que ver con perros; desde peluquería canina hasta psicopatología clínica canina. Podría sentar perros en un diván pero era más divertido seguir con cursos de auxiliar veterinaria y adiestramiento canino. Al fin y al cabo, ser psicólogo canino es ser psicólogo humano y ya hay demasiados humanos en esta vida.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Siempre ha luchado por vivir de lo que le gusta y tras hacer realidad hacer exposiciones de sus dibujos y trabajar con animales ya le tocaba publicar libros. Por eso tienes la oportunidad de leer su segunda novela, <i>Perros en el tintero,</i> que no es otra cosa que experiencia hilarante de la convivencia con estos simpáticos y desconcertantes animales.</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«―¿Qué quieres de postre?<br/>          ―No hay nada.<br/>          ―Hay galletas. Y… turrón. Sigo sin saber por qué aún me queda turrón.<br/>          ―Quiero hablar contigo.<br/>          ―Era del blando pero ya estará duro y… ¿Qué?<br/>          ―Que tengo que hablar contigo ―soltó Joana sorprendiéndose a sí misma.<br/>          ―Una cosa antes… ¿Te has desecho de eso? Mañana vienen los dueños de Mario y no quiero meterme en berenjenales.<br/>         Joana estuvo a punto de gruñir entre dientes y recordando la cadena del baño rezongó:<br/>          ―Sí. Ya no está.<br/>          ―Guay. Dime entonces.<br/>          ―Para adoptarme necesitas tener una pareja…<br/>          Noemí asintió como si nada y apoyó la barbilla sobre sus nudillos que sujetaban verticalmente el tenedor:<br/>          ―Ah, sí. Algo de eso he leído en el contrato.<br/>          ―¿Y dónde está?<br/>          Noemí miró el reloj:<br/>          ―Seguramente esté trabajando pero no te preocupes por él. No vive aquí ―Joana dejó de entender la conversación―. ¿Algo más?<br/>          ―¿Cómo que no vive aquí?<br/>          Noemí le dio vuelta al tenedor y se rascó la cabeza con él:<br/>          ―Para explicar es un poco enrevesado… Lo simplificaré. Esa parte del contrato de adopción está ligeramente amañada.<br/>          ―¿Qué?<br/>          ―No te exasperes. Solo un poco ―dijo sonriendo―. Era necesario para adoptarte.<br/>          ―¿Y por qué me has adoptado?<br/>          ―¿Qué por qué qué?<br/>          ―Que por qué me adoptaste.<br/>          Noemí se encogió de hombros:<br/>          ―Porque tú querías venir conmigo.<br/>          ―Pero por qué un adolescente. Los niños son mejores. Todo el mundo quiere niños.<br/>          ―¿En serio? ¿Con la de trabajo que dan? ―dijo Noemí como pensando en voz alta. Sacudió la cabeza y volvió a encogerse de hombros―: ¿De verdad importa el porqué? Si crees que te voy a obligar a vivir la vida de cualquier forma que a mí me convenga ni te preocupes. La vida es algo personal. Deberías vivirla como tú prefieras».</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
<li>Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><u>Aviso para navegantes</u>: La opción BACK IT es únicamente para realizar donaciones a la edición, por lo que no habrá comunicaciones posteriores en busca de datos de envío... cualquiera de las opciones válidas de reserva exige cumplimentar formulario para poder servir el pedido.</i></p>
<h3>Además...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona a la autora, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y <strong>Tania Canento</strong> vea publicada su obra.</p>
<p>Gracias por vuestro tiempo.</p>

Nacida en Pamplona, seguramente la encuentres allí o en medio del monte con sus perros. Tras pasar la ESO sin pena ni gloria vio en la FP de autoedición que podía hacerlo mejor y empezó bachiller artístico sin saber muy bien qué estaba haciendo pero lo aprobó y con esa base metió el hocico en todo lo que tuviera que ver con perros; desde peluquería canina hasta psicopatología clínica canina. Podría sentar perros en un diván pero era más divertido seguir con cursos de auxiliar veterinaria y adiestramiento canino. Al fin y al cabo, ser psicólogo canino es ser psicólogo humano y ya hay demasiados humanos en esta vida.
Siempre ha luchado por vivir de lo que le gusta y tras hacer realidad hacer exposiciones de sus dibujos y trabajar con animales ya le tocaba publicar libros. Por eso tienes la oportunidad de leer su segunda novela, Perros en el tintero, que no es otra cosa que experiencia hilarante de la convivencia con estos simpáticos y desconcertantes animales.
¿Por qué?
Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:
«―¿Qué quieres de postre?          ―No hay nada.          ―Hay galletas. Y… turrón. Sigo sin saber por qué aún me queda turrón.          ―Quiero hablar contigo.          ―Era del blando pero ya estará duro y… ¿Qué?          ―Que tengo que hablar contigo ―soltó Joana sorprendiéndose a sí misma.          ―Una cosa antes… ¿Te has desecho de eso? Mañana vienen los dueños de Mario y no quiero meterme en berenjenales.         Joana estuvo a punto de gruñir entre dientes y recordando la cadena del baño rezongó:          ―Sí. Ya no está.          ―Guay. Dime entonces.          ―Para adoptarme necesitas tener una pareja…          Noemí asintió como si nada y apoyó la barbilla sobre sus nudillos que sujetaban verticalmente el tenedor:          ―Ah, sí. Algo de eso he leído en el contrato.          ―¿Y dónde está?          Noemí miró el reloj:          ―Seguramente esté trabajando pero no te preocupes por él. No vive aquí ―Joana dejó de entender la conversación―. ¿Algo más?          ―¿Cómo que no vive aquí?          Noemí le dio vuelta al tenedor y se rascó la cabeza con él:          ―Para explicar es un poco enrevesado… Lo simplificaré. Esa parte del contrato de adopción está ligeramente amañada.          ―¿Qué?          ―No te exasperes. Solo un poco ―dijo sonriendo―. Era necesario para adoptarte.          ―¿Y por qué me has adoptado?          ―¿Qué por qué qué?          ―Que por qué me adoptaste.          Noemí se encogió de hombros:          ―Porque tú querías venir conmigo.          ―Pero por qué un adolescente. Los niños son mejores. Todo el mundo quiere niños.          ―¿En serio? ¿Con la de trabajo que dan? ―dijo Noemí como pensando en voz alta. Sacudió la cabeza y volvió a encogerse de hombros―: ¿De verdad importa el porqué? Si crees que te voy a obligar a vivir la vida de cualquier forma que a mí me convenga ni te preocupes. La vida es algo personal. Deberías vivirla como tú prefieras».
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Aviso para navegantes: La opción BACK IT es únicamente para realizar donaciones a la edición, por lo que no habrá comunicaciones posteriores en busca de datos de envío... cualquiera de las opciones válidas de reserva exige cumplimentar formulario para poder servir el pedido.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona a la autora, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Tania Canento vea publicada su obra.
Gracias por vuestro tiempo.

I wrote this book because it became apparent to me over the years that I was personally struggling to find fulfillment in the places I worked over time. I was not alone, discovering a trend with friends, family members, colleagues, and strangers with similar stories and experiences.

Harness it, cherish it, and most importantly don’t be afraid to share it with the world.</p><p>In this book, you'll learn about what factors drive and unlock the highest levels of performance in individuals and teams and how these same factors result in personal fulfillment, which translate into something unstoppable: #PerFORM. <strong>You'll connect with stories from ordinary individuals that have reached extraordinary heights including...</strong></p><ul>

</ul><h2> </h2><h2>About the Author</h2><p>Peter Malek is Head of Productivity for Consumer Informations Services in North America at Experian. Professionally, Peter is a versatile and proven Business and Technology executive with 20+ years of progressive achievement in organizational strategy, operational excellence, project/change management, product management, and business process optimization. 10+ years of leadership including building, implementing and scaling process excellence &amp; automation practices, curriculum, training, offerings and service solutions.</p><p>Peter’s experience has revealed that the design of a team, including the role of a manager, cannot be determined based on performance alone. An organization has to closely examine individual levels of general happiness and emotional intelligence. As part of shifting from today’s mindset to tomorrow’s, organizations need to redesign how they operate.</p><p>When Peter started his book writing journey, he intended to focus on a new lens for process improvement to enable a high performing organization based on his extensive years of experience and depth of knowledge in process and operational excellence. It dawned on him that there was more to it than adoption and implementation of process improvement methods to create an environment that is truly high performing. That is what gave way to #PerFORM. Peter has always been a highly self motivated and top performing individual. At the same time, he will be the first to admit he has made many mistakes and had multiple failures as part of his journey. Peter is constantly seeking to improve and upgrade himself. This pursuit has ignited his passion in researching, reading, and taking courses, all in an ongoing attempt to unlock more meaning and fulfillment in his personal and professional career.</p><p>If you're a leader ready to build a company culture that unlocks the motivation of employees, who wants to give way to creative and innovative problem-solving, and create an environment that brings the hearts and minds of every employee to work each day as part of serving each other and the customer, this book is for you. If you're an employee looking to assess whether or not the environment you are in will unlock your greatest performance and personal fulfillment, this book is for you. After reading this book, you will be in a position to understand the maturity level of performance and fulfillment for yourself as a soon-to-be employee, existing employee or leader.</p><p>Whether you are self-employed, a startup beginning your journey, a young person fresh out of college looking for your first job, a battle-tested employee, a well-established company, or a senior executive, this book has stories, insights and lessons you can relate to, and thinking you can immediately put into practice to improve yourself, others, and your organization.</p><p>We often don’t realize what we need to be fulfilled until much later in life. If I’m able to impart the learnings from my experience as well as those I have gathered from experts in various fields to help save you time, stress, frustrations and avoid or minimize painful experiences in your life, I will consider this book a success.</p><p>For more information, you can connect with Peter Malek at <a href=""mailto:petemalek@gmail.com?subject=Connect%20with%20the%20Author"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">petemalek@gmail.com</a> and <a href=""http://linkedin.com/in/peter-malek-8a980a1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">linkedin.com/in/peter-malek-8a980a1 </a></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630511743/serkhcennr7o8b1fta1d.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2>International Preorders</h2><p><strong>For international preorders, please do the following:</strong></p><ul>

<h3><strong>War of Words — Progressive Media Conference</strong></h3>
<p><br/>The Norwich Radical are hosting their second ever progressive media conference in <strong>February 2018</strong>.</p>
<p>Our media is dominated by right wing voices, from Tory tabloids to Blairite broadsheets. Big business holds huge sway in broadcast, print and online journalism. It perpetuates the reactionary messages we hear and receive, making it complicit in the rise of a louder, powerful, regressive, conservative movement across the globe.</p>
<p>We're bringing people together from across the arts, academia, media, politics and activism to discuss, debate and enlighten on how we can build a better media and a more progressive society.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to do this we need to pay for all sorts of things — from publicity to expenses and from equipment hire to signage. We're gathering some of our funding through merchandise sales and charging organisations for stalls, but we can't cover everything this way alone. So that's where you come in!</p>
<p>What your money could go towards:</p>
<p>£5 would allow us to print 250 fliers<br/>£10 would allow us to print 50 posters<br/>£30 would allow us to reimburse one speaker's transport expenses<br/>£100 would allow us to fund a panel of speakers, including all transport expenses</p>
<p>In <strong>previous years</strong> we've had <strong>speakers and panels </strong>including Natalie Bennett, Michelle Stanistreet, Ben Chacko, Keri-Anne Mendoza, OpenDemocracy, Positive News, the English Collective of Prostitutes, Travellers Times, European Roma Rights Centre, and the New Internationalist. We'll be announcing this year's lineup and speakers in the near future!</p>

What your money could go towards:
£5 would allow us to print 250 fliers£10 would allow us to print 50 posters£30 would allow us to reimburse one speaker's transport expenses£100 would allow us to fund a panel of speakers, including all transport expenses
In previous years we've had speakers and panels including Natalie Bennett, Michelle Stanistreet, Ben Chacko, Keri-Anne Mendoza, OpenDemocracy, Positive News, the English Collective of Prostitutes, Travellers Times, European Roma Rights Centre, and the New Internationalist. We'll be announcing this year's lineup and speakers in the near future!

<h3>  Once in love...</h3>
<p>In this debut novel, Cathryn Kusner-Thompson invites readers into the flash and passion of the international world of dance. Readers meet Lillian Josephson, who has settled into a comfortable, predictable - and fabulously wealthy - existence with her long-time husband Charles. Lillian is not only a grande-dame of dance, but the center of a warm and talented circle of friends and family.</p>
<p>But Lillian's carefully maintained equilibrium is upset by a fateful meeting with her former lover, Tony, as she undertkes a challenging role as choreographer for her brother's new Broadway production. Will this chance meeting unravel Lillian - Lily, as Tony insists - and the cloak of security and stability she pulls tightly around her?  </p>
<p>Does Tony hold only the keys to the past, or is he the gatekeeper of a passionate future with the power to undue Lily's career, marriage, and all she's come to cherish?</p>

<p>We have met with government officials (including a Minister &amp; Deputy Minister) and they love what we've created in Ontario, and we were even mentioned in Ontario's Open Government Engagement Team's Open Data Policy Recommendation report (""<a href=""http://www.ontario.ca/government/open-default-new-way-forward-ontario"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Open by Default</a>""). iamsick.ca has also been presented by government officials as an example of a social enterprise that can leverage open data to improve the delivery of public services.  Receiving funding from the government isn't straight forward, and depends on regional priorities.  For now, funding this service isn't a priority.  However, we are and will continue to engage with government officials at the provincial, regional and municipal levels to encourage their involvement in Open Data initiatives and to explore funding opportunities. </p>

<p></p>The funding goals were determined based on the cost of expanding into additional provinces, plus the added cost associated with increased usage (and taking into account the chance associated with having the crowd decide which province next [ie. PEI vs BC]).  This includes wages so we can focus full-time effort on expanding our coverage in the short timeframe, and the costs associated with gathering, validating &amp; filling in gaps.<p><br/></p>

<p></p>iamsick.ca has already helped tens of thousands of Ontarians, and we are committed to expanding our service regardless of how much money we raise.  If we do not reach our goal, we will expand into the province with the most votes at a slower pace.  Backers will still get a vote to decide ""where next?"", but it'll likely happen sometime this summer instead of by early July.<br/>But that is the worst case scenario, and there are enough backers who are interested in helping Canadians access healthcare, right?<p><br/></p>

""iamsick.ca is a brilliant solution to a problem many Canadians face every day: where to go when they're sick."" - Mobile Syrup
 




(The Medical Post snapshot)







Our goal is to make the Canadian healthcare system more accessible to the public.

We've started with Ontario.. With your help, we can expand Canada-wide. 
Your vote will decide the province we'll add next!






Imagine hiking with your friends, and someone gets injured.  What do you do?
Have you ever tried calling a pharmacy or walk-in clinic, and only get their answering machine?  Wouldn't it be great to send them an email instead?
What about those long wait-times and queuing at walk-in clinics?
iamsick.ca is making access to healthcare easier for both the patient and the healthcare system.  Our healthcare wayfinding website & mobile apps show nearby emergency departments, urgent care centres, walk-in/after-hours clinics, and pharmacies for all of Ontario.In September 2012, we launched the iamsick.ca website for University of Toronto students...but now it's time for us to expand the service Canada-wide!
Last year:- we released free smartphone apps for BlackBerry 10, iPhone & Android- our team was a finalist in the Ontario Centres of Excellence Student Social Entrepreneurship competition- the iamsick.ca app was recognized as one of the best mobile health applications at the National Canadian e-Health conferenceiamsick.ca has since been actively engaged in policy discussions to encourage governments to release healthcare provider data through Open Data initiatives, and iamsick.ca was even cited in Ontario's Open by Default report in March 2014.
Our ultimate goal is leverage technology to reduce barriers when accessing healthcare, but we need your help to take us to the next level!




















We are looking to raise $9,000 to allow us to focus on expanding into a second Canadian province within a short timeframe (by July 9th).  And, we'll let you decide which province we'll expand into.  Your support and vote will show us that you want this service in your area.
Our ultimate goal is to grow our service Canada-wide.  If we raise $90,000, you will get full Canada-wide coverage in September.. from Cape Spear on the East coast..to Vancouver Island on the West coast.. and even up to Alert in the North.Our free mobile apps will be perfect for your Canada-wide road trip, bike trip, hike or run.
If we do not reach our goal of $9,000, we will expand into the province with the most votes, but it will take us much longer.
So, please help us reach our goal, so all Canadians can benefit from our apps this summer!

 WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT iamsick.ca











 RECENT RECOGNITION

Finalist - 2013 Ontario Centres for Excellence Student Social Entrepreneurship competition
Winning app - 2013 Canadian e-Health conference - Battle of the Apps competition







 WHERE CAN I DOWNLOAD THE FREE IAMSICK.CA APPS?










 DOESN'T THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT COVER THE COST OF HEALTHCARE? SHOULDN'T THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR THIS SERVICE? 
We have met with government officials (including a Minister & Deputy Minister) and they love what we've created in Ontario, and we were even mentioned in Ontario's Open Government Engagement Team's Open Data Policy Recommendation report (""Open by Default""). iamsick.ca has also been presented by government officials as an example of a social enterprise that can leverage open data to improve the delivery of public services.  Receiving funding from the government isn't straight forward, and depends on regional priorities.  For now, funding this service isn't a priority.  However, we are and will continue to engage with government officials at the provincial, regional and municipal levels to encourage their involvement in Open Data initiatives and to explore funding opportunities. 



HOW WILL THE MONEY BE SPENT?
The funding goals were determined based on the cost of expanding into additional provinces, plus the added cost associated with increased usage (and taking into account the chance associated with having the crowd decide which province next [ie. PEI vs BC]).  This includes wages so we can focus full-time effort on expanding our coverage in the short timeframe, and the costs associated with gathering, validating & filling in gaps.

WHAT IF YOU DON'T REACH YOUR GOAL?
iamsick.ca has already helped tens of thousands of Ontarians, and we are committed to expanding our service regardless of how much money we raise.  If we do not reach our goal, we will expand into the province with the most votes at a slower pace.  Backers will still get a vote to decide ""where next?"", but it'll likely happen sometime this summer instead of by early July.But that is the worst case scenario, and there are enough backers who are interested in helping Canadians access healthcare, right?

<p>“A book could be written on Tazy Phyllipz's involvement in both the Orange County music and ska scenes, but we don't have the space for that.”</p>
<p>Little did the <em>OC Weekly</em> know that, when they wrote that in February 2011, the Skafather was already ahead of them.  So here it is, the new book from Tazy Phyllipz. </p>
<p> <em>The Rock N Roll, Ska Adventures of Tazy Phyllipz</em></p>
<p>From the beginnings of No Doubt to the breaking of Sublime and Maroon5, to the behind the scenes at being at the World Famous KROQ, to the life-changing decision of Travis Barker to the creation of Ska Parade, Tazy shares it all, and shares it all with you!</p>
<p>The book is a non-stop collection of historic, personal, hilarious, and serious stories.  Ska is back, and the Skafather is ready to tell you why!  Get an inside look at how he contributed and how he has been involved since his intro to the scene in 1989.</p>

<h2><strong>Help publishing NATURE DIARY – AFRICA!</strong></h2>
<p>Planeta Vivo (Living Planet) is seeking help to publish the Nature Diary – Africa. This Diary contains unique illustrations created by Luisa Nunes, Professor of Ecology and Artist. Luisa has spent her life sharing her unique insight about Nature and the World she sees around her. She shares this passion for nature with her paintings. Five years ago she started to compile the first Nature Diary, her idea was to motivate people for field observations and to inspire those interested in the natural world, starting with her own students. The Nature Diary has been published in Portuguese and has been very successful. But now the Publisher Living Planet, in collaboration with Luisa Nunes, is seeking a wider audience. Therefore, in this fifth edition, dedicated to the biodiversity of Africa, Luisa decided to make a full version in Portuguese and other in English.</p>
<p>The Portuguese version is already in press and is named Diário de Natureza 2013-África.  But additional funding is needed to complete the publication of the English version that can be used for three years. Your contribution will go towards the printing and distribution costs of the Diary and, as a perk, you may receive the English and/or Portuguese versions of the Diary autographed by the author, among other really cool perks.</p>

<p>Luisa Nunes é professora  mas a sua verdadeira paixão é a ilustração da natureza. Por isso, há cinco anos que se dedica à elaboração de o Diário da Natureza, para que todos possam usufruir dessa sua paixão. O Diário da Natureza é uma agenda anual ilustrada que tem sido editado em português, o que limita muito o acesso ao público não lusófono. Por isso, nesta quinta edição, dedicada à biodiversidade de África, a Luisa decidiu fazer uma versão inteira em português e outra em inglês. O Diário será editado pela PLANETA VIVO. A versão em português tem o nome de DIÁRIO DA NATUREZA 2013 - ÁFRICA e a versão inglesa NATURE DIARY - AFRICA. Precisamos da sua ajuda para editar estes belíssimos diários.</p>
<p>A sua contribuição tornará possível suportar uma parte da impressão e distribuição do Diário da Natureza. E ainda receberá em troca um belíssimo exemplar desta obra autografado pela autora, na versão portuguesa ou inglesa, conforme a sua preferência! </p>

Por isso, nesta quinta edição, dedicada à biodiversidade de África, a Luisa decidiu fazer uma versão inteira em português e outra em inglês. O Diário será editado pela PLANETA VIVO. A versão em português tem o nome de DIÁRIO DA NATUREZA 2013 - ÁFRICA e a versão inglesa NATURE DIARY - AFRICA. Precisamos da sua ajuda para editar estes belíssimos diários.
A sua contribuição tornará possível suportar uma parte da impressão e distribuição do Diário da Natureza. E ainda receberá em troca um belíssimo exemplar desta obra autografado pela autora, na versão portuguesa ou inglesa, conforme a sua preferência!

What We Need & What You Get

EN
For the edition, the Living Planet needs $16,000 to cover printing costs. Eleven thousand have already been raised but the remaining $5000 are still needed so any help will be most appreciated and indeed will contribute in some small way to a better understanding and appreciating of the environment and nature that surround us. You may wish to choose a beautiful perk and this will be sent to you at the end of the campaign. Some of the perks are: A lovely postcard with one of the Nature diary illustrations, an autographed copy by the diary’s author, or, a copy of an engraving numbered illustration also signed by the author (limited edition).

PT
Para a edição, a Planeta Vivo necessita de 16.000 dólares para a impressão e tem 11.000 dólares para esse fim. Por isso, a sua ajuda é preciosa para obter o resto do valor necessário. Em contrapartida receberá (conforme o seu contributo): Exemplares autografados pela autora com o seu nome; Um cartão postal com uma ilustração do Diário; ou, se for muito generoso, uma cópia de uma gravura do Diário numerada e assinada pela autora, numa edição limitada.
 


The Impact

EN
This is an unique project. There are no other nature diaries that celebrate the natural splendor of life like this one. Luisa also has other future campaigns that depend on the success of the Diary project. You will be contributing to a larger programme where Luisa will reveal inspiring ways for others to experience and appreciate the natural wonders from different regions on this planet.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Many philosophers, futurologists and artificial intelligence researchers have conjectured that <strong>in the next 20 to 200 years a machine capable of at least human level performance on all tasks will be developed</strong>. Since such a machine would among other things be capable of designing the next generation of even smarter intelligent machines, it is generally assumed that an intelligence explosion will take place shortly after such a technological self-improvement cycle begins. While specific predictions regarding the consequences of such an intelligence singularity are varied from potential economic hardship to the complete extinction of the humankind, many of the involved researchers agree that the issue is of utmost importance and needs to be seriously addressed. This book, “<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Artificial Superintelligence: A Futuristic Approach</span>” will directly address this issue and consolidate research aimed at <strong>making sure that emerging superintelligence is beneficial to humanity</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Who am I and what is this children’s book about?</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Annesa L Lacey of Chicago, IL and I am a budding social media/event marketer and ghost-writer.  Being a mother and social media and event marketer is my life.  I’m so proud of my teenage daughter and the excellent woman she is becoming.  She’s a great-natured kid who looks out for her fellow mankind and is always laughing, if not always encouraging others.</p>
<p>Pretty hard to believe, considering the rocky start she got in life.  Her parents have been divorced since October 2002, and this precious child had encountered strife while still in the womb.</p>
<p>By grace, my daughter has long overcome the combative atmosphere she was momentarily accustomed to living in, along with the respiratory issues she was born with.  One day when my daughter was just four years old, she decided to assert “authority” over her parents, demanding that my ex-husband and I be quiet. She had her fill of our bickering in front of her.</p>
<p>This book is to serve as a help to parents – for them to remember no child’s first lesson in warfare should begin in the home.  That’s it.  Nothing else.  This book will be told from a child’s vantage-point, because that should be the most valued point of view there is.</p>
<p>Because every little bit helps, the sooner this book is completed, the sooner parents around the world can have an extra reminder of just who matters most in their households: their children.</p>

<p>-      $199 for every single illustration</p>
<p>I have 27 illustrations in my book – including the cover.</p>
<p>Without funding, this project is going to take much longer to complete as I self-fund all of my works. The longer it takes to publish, the longer kids around the world have to wait to get a voice in book-form.</p>
<p>What are the perks?   They’ll range from my heart-felt thanks to a free copy of the book upon publication, and even better: a mention in the “Special Thanks” section of the book.  Or how about a feature of your organization or brand in online media?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why Should You Care?</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s face it: we’re inundated frequently with news of how our children are lost or otherwise out of control.  Why?  Have they ever been given a voice?  Have they ever been told they (or their points of view) matter?</p>
<p>Have they ever been told how great they are?   Let’s turn off our tech devices, turn off our TV’s and find out what our kids are up to!  Let’s disconnect ourselves from what we’ve given so much attention to unnecessarily, and tune into those people in our houses who are literally on stand-by, just waiting for us to show a sliver of interest in their lives, who their friends are, and just overall care of how they are doing!</p>
<p>Listen, you won’t catch my kid on Dr. Phil for any intervention!  I just look into my kids eyes (and track her Instagram, Twitter, tumblr and Facebook accounts!) and <em>talk</em> to her.  I let her know her opinion counts. </p>
<p>Parents, let our littlest or tallest ones know that we value their input!</p>
<p>Lastly, I am very passionate about helping other parents as well as children.  For the love of everything good, PLEASE allow me and my ex-husband to serve as a cautionary tale as how NOT to handle conflict in front of children when they are smallest and most impressionable.</p>
<p>Remember, you can specify how much you give! The levels are just suggestions, but if you want to contribute an 'in between' amount, please do so!</p>

Who am I and what is this children’s book about?
My name is Annesa L Lacey of Chicago, IL and I am a budding social media/event marketer and ghost-writer.  Being a mother and social media and event marketer is my life.  I’m so proud of my teenage daughter and the excellent woman she is becoming.  She’s a great-natured kid who looks out for her fellow mankind and is always laughing, if not always encouraging others.
Pretty hard to believe, considering the rocky start she got in life.  Her parents have been divorced since October 2002, and this precious child had encountered strife while still in the womb.
By grace, my daughter has long overcome the combative atmosphere she was momentarily accustomed to living in, along with the respiratory issues she was born with.  One day when my daughter was just four years old, she decided to assert “authority” over her parents, demanding that my ex-husband and I be quiet. She had her fill of our bickering in front of her.
This book is to serve as a help to parents – for them to remember no child’s first lesson in warfare should begin in the home.  That’s it.  Nothing else.  This book will be told from a child’s vantage-point, because that should be the most valued point of view there is.
Because every little bit helps, the sooner this book is completed, the sooner parents around the world can have an extra reminder of just who matters most in their households: their children.
What I’ve Already Done
I have already paid for the following:



Book publishing package


PR Publicist 


Standard Interior Format


Private label imprint and optional ISBN 


Print-ready cover


Paperback Format



 
What I Need and What You’ll Get Out of It
The costs are as follows:
-      $237 Fundraising campaign fees
-      $999 for every 10 illustrations;
-      $199 for every single illustration
I have 27 illustrations in my book – including the cover.
Without funding, this project is going to take much longer to complete as I self-fund all of my works. The longer it takes to publish, the longer kids around the world have to wait to get a voice in book-form.
What are the perks?   They’ll range from my heart-felt thanks to a free copy of the book upon publication, and even better: a mention in the “Special Thanks” section of the book.  Or how about a feature of your organization or brand in online media?
 
Why Should You Care?
Let’s face it: we’re inundated frequently with news of how our children are lost or otherwise out of control.  Why?  Have they ever been given a voice?  Have they ever been told they (or their points of view) matter?
Have they ever been told how great they are?   Let’s turn off our tech devices, turn off our TV’s and find out what our kids are up to!  Let’s disconnect ourselves from what we’ve given so much attention to unnecessarily, and tune into those people in our houses who are literally on stand-by, just waiting for us to show a sliver of interest in their lives, who their friends are, and just overall care of how they are doing!
Listen, you won’t catch my kid on Dr. Phil for any intervention!  I just look into my kids eyes (and track her Instagram, Twitter, tumblr and Facebook accounts!) and talk to her.  I let her know her opinion counts. 
Parents, let our littlest or tallest ones know that we value their input!
Lastly, I am very passionate about helping other parents as well as children.  For the love of everything good, PLEASE allow me and my ex-husband to serve as a cautionary tale as how NOT to handle conflict in front of children when they are smallest and most impressionable.
Remember, you can specify how much you give! The levels are just suggestions, but if you want to contribute an 'in between' amount, please do so!
 
Other Ways You Can Help
It’s Ok if you don't have $20 to contribute. Please help spread the word of this IndieGoGo campaign through each of your social media channels.  Without your help, this campaign won't be successful.

<h2>Présentation de la revue Les 3 sex*</h2>
<p>Alors que la tendance des magazines indépendants, au contenu recherché et à l’esthétisme léché, a pris d'assaut l’Angleterre et l’Australie, le Québec amorce tranquillement son entrée dans la mouvance. Habituellement réservé à l’art de vivre, à la culture ou à la cuisine, les revues professionnelles y sont rares. Les 3 sex*, dont le titre dérive des termes sexe, sexualité, sexologie, se présente comme une revue indépendante spécialisée dans les domaines de la sexologie et connexe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>La revue Les 3 sex* se trouve à mi-chemin entre le journal académique et la revue culturelle. Ne publiant pas d’articles scientifiques, elle offre plutôt à son lectorat une diversité de contenu rigoureux ayant pour thème commun la sexualité. La recension d’actualité sexologique et de production scientifique permet au lectorat d’être à jour sur l’évolution de la discipline. Alors que les chroniques et les témoignages stimulent les questionnements sur une variété de thématiques.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Adressé principalement à un public d’universitaires et de professionnels, la revue Les 3 sex* ne vise pas la vulgarisation de contenu mais plutôt le partage et l’échange sur des enjeux sexologiques. D’autre part, malgré son public cible, la revue sexologique n’est pas réservé à ce dernier et s’avère enrichissante pour la population intéressée à la discipline sexologique.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Pourquoi une levée de fonds?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Afin d'inaugurer officiellement le site internet (les3sex.com) de la revue sexologique Les 3 sex*, un lancement se déroulement le 20 septembre au Lobby Bar, à Montréal. Puisque nous désirons offrir une entrée gratuite et assurer les frais de location de matériel et de personnel, même si nous faisons salle comble, nous perderons de l'argent. De plus, l'argent amassé pourra assurer en partie les coûts associés à la création et la gestion du site internet, nécéssaire au lancement. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>À noter que les cinquantes premières personnes qui feront des dons de 20$ ou plus seront récompensé d'un billet pour le lancement. Simplement nous envoyé un message à les3sex@gmail.com afin de récolter votre récompense.</strong></p>

<h3>About the Book:</h3>
<div>This is the third volume in the series, and it covers more advanced techniques, like the <a href=""http://www.swordschool.com/wiki/index.php/Punta_Falsa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Punta Falsa</a>, and more detailed discussion of the source: <i>Il Fior di Battaglia. </i>The book includes detailed instructions for three longsword forms, known as ""<a href=""http://www.swordschool.com/wiki/index.php/Cutting_drill"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Cutting Drill</a>"", the ""<a href=""http://www.swordschool.com/wiki/index.php/Farfalle_di_Ferro"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Farfalla di Ferro</a>"", and ""<a href=""http://www.swordschool.com/wiki/index.php/Syllabus_Form"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Syllabus Form</a>"". Each step of the Syllabus Form is expanded on at some length, and includes a wide range of material from <i>Il Fior di Battaglia. </i>
</div>
<div>The Cutting Drill is a basic sequence of six blows, followed by four more sophisticated techniques. By itself, it contains every common strike in the system at least once, and an example of every core principle in action. The Farfalla di Ferro is a striking drill that emphasises continuous flowing motion; it's beautiful, and deadly! The Syllabus Form, as the name implies, contains a reference to just about every aspect of Fiore's Art of Arms. It took about 12 years to develop it to its current peak of usefulness.</div>
<div>The material in the book is supported by a wide range of video clips and free articles.</div>
<div>The table of contents should give you a good idea of how much material I cover.</div>

primeros ácidos. La decadencia del desamor, los celos y el odio. La soledad de
un camello y los estragos de la heroína. Los hippies de Cadaqués y la

conocer España entera. También he sido fabricante de jabón, importador de

Since then, I’ve received hundreds of emails from people around the world that wanted to thank me for writing it. I also received success stories via email from people that had read and followed my article and landed their first web developer job after 2 months. Some of the readers asked me if I ever considered writing a book where I would go more in depth and share my experience and techniques. So I took their comments to heart and I decided to go even further into the subject and explain in detail how to learn not only ruby and rails but also how to think like a hacker, and learn coding more efficiently.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/841186/files/20140907174935-howITrainedbook.png?1410137375"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Unlock Each Chapters </b></p><p>Every-time a milestone is reached I'll write a new chapter.</p><p><b>- $100 - Prologue - My Story</b></p><p><b>-  $200 - Chapter 1 - Cultivating the mindset</b></p><p>- $300 -<strike> Chapter 2 - Understanding Programming</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $400 - <strike>Chapter 3 - The Knockout Method: How I train to learn smarter</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $500 - <strike>Chapter 4 - Learn to search like a Hacker</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $600 - <strike>Chapter 5 - It’s all about the syntax </strike>- UNLOCK</p><p>- $700 -<strike> Chapter 6 - My favourite resources and tools</strike>- UNLOCK</p><p>- $800 - <strike>Chapter 7 - Command line crash course</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $900 - <strike>Chapter 8 - Getting to know Ruby like a ninja</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $1000 - <strike>Chapter 9 - Pry Sensei : The debugger who told me everything</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $1100 - <strike>Chapter 10 -This is how the web works</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $1200 - <strike>Chapter 11 - The ABC of HTML/CSS</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $1300 -<strike> Chapter 12 - Master your browser dev tool, Master the Web</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $1400 -<strike> Chapter 13 - The 4 steps to DEV epiphany</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $1500 - <strike>Chapter 14 - Jump into RAILiality</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $1600 -<strike> Chapter 15 - Model, Views and Controllers</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $1700 - <strike>Chapter 16 - Config files and Databases</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $1800 - <strike>Chapter 17 - Mastering Parameters, Requests and Routing</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $1900 - <strike>Chapter 18 - RVM, GEMs and GEMSETs</strike> - UNLOCK</p><p>- $2000 - <strike>Chapter 19 - UNLOCK THIS TITLE</strike> - UNLOCK</p><h3><br/></h3><h3>WHY DOES THIS MATTER FOR EVERYONE?</h3><p>There are hundreds of programming books out there that focuse on specific languages but not enough that allow someone that have absolutely no background in computer or programming to learn how to code quickly.</p><p>I want to help people build a foundation that will allow them to learn ruby, rails and their next language smarter and faster.

<p><span></span></p>
<p>Writers' Studio, in conjunction with The Cape Town Central Library, are taking Writers Boot Camp to Cape Town, South Africa. </p>
<p>The Writers Boot Camp is scheduled to be held from the 24th – 28th of November 2014.The Workshops will be facilitated by acclaimed writers and teachers, and fueled by peer critique.  The six hour daily sessions are designed to help participants assess their own work objectively, while working on issues of craft. In the evenings participants will attend readings and interact with distinguished visiting writers who will share their professional experiences.</p>
<p><span>A series of evening events and a story exchange seminar powered by Narrative 4 will complete the workshops.</span><br/></p>
<p><span>The Cape Town workshop will be facilitated by Jeffery Renard Allen, Rob Spillman, Rachel Zadok and Jenna Cato Bass.</span></p>
<p>The workshop is free and, as such, participants will not be charged any participation fee.<br/></p>
<p><b>Objectives:</b></p>
<p>• To ignite the imagination of participants and then show them how to turn those blazing ideas into stunning stories.</p>
<p>•  To support and strengthen literature in Africa, especially South Africa</p>
<p>•  To create a platform for artists in Cape Town to express, develop and expose their art.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<span><br/></span>Writers' Studio is a non-profit organization that relies on the generosity of the literary enthusiasts for support. Our Scholarship Fund helps defray the cost associated with organizing our workshops, ensuring that our participants, especially those who have demonstrated promise through their entries participate in our programs free of charge.</div>
<div><p>We see our projects as pivotal given that writers in Africa often have either limited or no access to educational opportunities and training.</p></div> <p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p> <ul>
<li>We need to raise $18 000 to cover the costs involved with bringing the facilitators and  to Cape Town. This includes travel, accommodation and nosh. (don't tell them, but we're planning on feeding them sandwiches).  Every facilitator is donating their time for free. </li>
<li>$2000 goes towards workshop materials and refreshments for the participants and facilitators. </li>
<li>$1000 goes towards covering fees and charges related to this campaign.</li>
<li>Cape Town Central Library has partnered with us and is providing the venue. We're grateful to them that we don't have to pay for that. This is a picture of the amazing amphitheater where our readings will take place.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><p></p>

<p><br/></p></span>
</li>
<li>Help us a little and we'll splash our gratitude all over social media, which will make you very popular. One can't put a price on popularity. A little more and one of the acclaimed authors involved will personally email you a short story attached to the end of a thank you note. Give generously, and  award-winning author of your choice will sign and personally inscribe a copy of their book and send it to you.  Sponsors wanting to benefit from the good PR this project generates for all involved can buy a spot on our website and programme for their company logo.  We're doing this for the love of African literature, and we know you're funding us for the same reason.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
</div><p><span>Creative writing workshops offer people an opportunity for self-expression and help them to shape their thoughts and transform their experiences into powerful stories or pieces. Writers' Studio organizes programs for anyone wishing to nurture their creativity, stimulate their imagination and develop their writing skills. Writers' Studio is for both beginner writers who want to get the fundamental techniques of writing under their belt, and also for experienced writers who wish to sharpen their writing skills. </span></p><p>Writers’ Studio was started in 2013 by Nigerian writer, Samuel Kolawole as a leap of faith.  He used the money for his rent and moved to his parent’s house. Within a short time Writers Studio successfully organized writing workshops in major cities in Nigeria with hundreds of writers participating. The project was so well-received that in 2014 the organization decided to extend her activities to other African countries.  In June 2014, Writers’ Studio presented a five day workshop during the 2014 Writivism Festival in Kampala, Uganda. The project was in collaboration with Center for African Cultural Excellence (CACE), The Prince Claus Fund, The Danish Centre for Culture and Development, Open Society Initiative for Eastern Africa and The African Writers Trust.</p><p>Past facilitators of Writers' Studio workshops have included: literary agent, David Godwin, Zukiswa Wanner, NoViolet Bulawayo, Abubakar Adam Ibrahim, Toni Kan, Igoni Barrett, Yewande Omotoso, Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi, Ayodele Morroco Clarke, amongst others.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/812826/files/20140826043643-IMG_3359.jpg?1409053003"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Testimonials from Participants</b></p><p><i>If you've ever wondered whether there's an emerging writer, poet or journalist in you, then a Writers' Studio workshop is an opportunity you definitely don't want to miss.

</div> <p><br/></p></div>","A Short Summary  

Writers' Studio, in conjunction with The Cape Town Central Library, are taking Writers Boot Camp to Cape Town, South Africa. 
The Writers Boot Camp is scheduled to be held from the 24th – 28th of November 2014.The Workshops will be facilitated by acclaimed writers and teachers, and fueled by peer critique.  The six hour daily sessions are designed to help participants assess their own work objectively, while working on issues of craft. In the evenings participants will attend readings and interact with distinguished visiting writers who will share their professional experiences.
A series of evening events and a story exchange seminar powered by Narrative 4 will complete the workshops.
The Cape Town workshop will be facilitated by Jeffery Renard Allen, Rob Spillman, Rachel Zadok and Jenna Cato Bass.
The workshop is free and, as such, participants will not be charged any participation fee.
Objectives:
• To ignite the imagination of participants and then show them how to turn those blazing ideas into stunning stories.
•  To support and strengthen literature in Africa, especially South Africa
•  To create a platform for artists in Cape Town to express, develop and expose their art.

   

What We Need & What You Get

Writers' Studio is a non-profit organization that relies on the generosity of the literary enthusiasts for support. Our Scholarship Fund helps defray the cost associated with organizing our workshops, ensuring that our participants, especially those who have demonstrated promise through their entries participate in our programs free of charge.
We see our projects as pivotal given that writers in Africa often have either limited or no access to educational opportunities and training. Break it down for folks in more detail: 
We need to raise $18 000 to cover the costs involved with bringing the facilitators and  to Cape Town. This includes travel, accommodation and nosh. (don't tell them, but we're planning on feeding them sandwiches).  Every facilitator is donating their time for free. 
$2000 goes towards workshop materials and refreshments for the participants and facilitators. 
$1000 goes towards covering fees and charges related to this campaign.
Cape Town Central Library has partnered with us and is providing the venue. We're grateful to them that we don't have to pay for that. This is a picture of the amazing amphitheater where our readings will take place.



Help us a little and we'll splash our gratitude all over social media, which will make you very popular. One can't put a price on popularity. A little more and one of the acclaimed authors involved will personally email you a short story attached to the end of a thank you note. Give generously, and  award-winning author of your choice will sign and personally inscribe a copy of their book and send it to you.  Sponsors wanting to benefit from the good PR this project generates for all involved can buy a spot on our website and programme for their company logo.  We're doing this for the love of African literature, and we know you're funding us for the same reason.
 If we don't reach our goal, we're still determined to go ahead with the Boot Camp. We'll just have to find other ways of raising the money. 
  


The Impact 
Creative writing workshops offer people an opportunity for self-expression and help them to shape their thoughts and transform their experiences into powerful stories or pieces. Writers' Studio organizes programs for anyone wishing to nurture their creativity, stimulate their imagination and develop their writing skills. Writers' Studio is for both beginner writers who want to get the fundamental techniques of writing under their belt, and also for experienced writers who wish to sharpen their writing skills. Writers’ Studio was started in 2013 by Nigerian writer, Samuel Kolawole as a leap of faith.  He used the money for his rent and moved to his parent’s house. Within a short time Writers Studio successfully organized writing workshops in major cities in Nigeria with hundreds of writers participating. The project was so well-received that in 2014 the organization decided to extend her activities to other African countries.  In June 2014, Writers’ Studio presented a five day workshop during the 2014 Writivism Festival in Kampala, Uganda. The project was in collaboration with Center for African Cultural Excellence (CACE), The Prince Claus Fund, The Danish Centre for Culture and Development, Open Society Initiative for Eastern Africa and The African Writers Trust.Past facilitators of Writers' Studio workshops have included: literary agent, David Godwin, Zukiswa Wanner, NoViolet Bulawayo, Abubakar Adam Ibrahim, Toni Kan, Igoni Barrett, Yewande Omotoso, Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi, Ayodele Morroco Clarke, amongst others.Testimonials from ParticipantsIf you've ever wondered whether there's an emerging writer, poet or journalist in you, then a Writers' Studio workshop is an opportunity you definitely don't want to miss. Let your imagination be unleashed and you'll be very pleasantly surprised. Samuel Kolawole and his friendly team put together a well organised, inspiring program - excellent value and great fun. Don't miss out, just do it!""Dayo Abayomi, Senior Consultant Gynaecologist, Ibadan/London“Sam Kolawole and the Writers' Studio team gave me the best days of my recent life. The absolute best!”Frank MbaAirline worker""Attending Writers' Studio was like finding that missing screw... A forum where you have access to the minds of beautiful writers...""Harry OkoromaduLawyer and Team Leader, ACE Network""The Writers' workshop in Ibadan remains, for me, a re-awakening- a timely wake up call for a sleeping muse. The sessions on Creative Non-Fiction, Developing as a Creative Writer, Prose Writing, and Poetry especially, granted me a fresh look at the creative landscape... I recall...the mere presence of those gifted facilitators...The next time I put pen to paper, I felt something well up from within me-a new wave of creative energy...""Koleola Oladayo JacobLawyer“What I enjoyed most from the Writers’ Studio Workshop were the intensive reading and writing exercises. These took me away from my comfort zone; when your work is critiqued you learn to be humble and develop a tough skin in the process. I also had the opportunity to ask celebrated writers on the continent questions and they were very helpful. In the end, you have an obligation to yourself to write, and the more you do that, the more you learn to write.""Emmanuel Anyole

<p>Greg is from the industrial heart of England, son of a soldier and a nurse, with a childhood background in brass bands and community theatre. A working class boy, his expectations were set pretty low until he discovered music and theatre almost simultaneously in his mid teens.  He recently appeared with Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton as Good 'Lias Hatfield in the hit US series ""Hatfields &amp; McCoys' which won 5 Emmys, and this year appeared with Bradley Walsh in the current series of 'Law &amp; Order UK'. Subsequent appearances include 'Vera -The Deer Hunters' alongside Brenda Blethyn, and a role in new US TV series The Assets. He has appeared in several episodes of Coronation Street as thug Jonny Smith and has featured in David Morrissey's directorial debut film Don't Worry About Me and alongside John Henson and Neil Fitzmaurice in the British comedy feature Charlie Noades RIP.  He will next be seen on stage at the Edinburgh Festival with Anne Archer in Terry Jastrow's hard-hitting play 'The Trial of Jane Fonda'.  <i><b><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/video/demo_reel/vi4202210329/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Watch his showreel</a></b></i>  and see why we want him as our wolf.<br/></p>

</div></div>","A damaged serial killer is stalking the city streets. Bodies left at random.Ritualistic in their method.Brutal.Can Detective Lobo find the JackPort Killer before events get too close?Too personal?Welcome to The Endless, Sprawling, Neon City beneath the broken EverNight.Welcome to the world of The Wolf.Acclaimed author Kneel Downe released the first of his Detective Kurt Lobo case files, The JackPort Killer, in May this year to great critical reception and his VirulentBlurb universe grew bigger. Starburst Magazine picked up on the teaser trailer for it and reviewed the book, saying “you will soon find yourself completely immersed into the bizarre, cyberpunk, dystopian world Downe has created, and find yourself wanting more” and TheCultDen gave it 10/10.  Now the universe is set to expand again as, for the first time, the Wolf gets a voice when The JackPort Killer comes to audiobook!Who wrote it?Kneel was born in 1967 and raised in the middle of countryside and silence where he immersed himself in books and fantasy.  After trying several writing styles, Kneel began tweeting short fragments of fiction. A meeting with his idol, Jeff Noon, made Kneel realise that these short bursts could make up a whole universe of fiction and so the VirulentBlurb projects began.Who is this Kurt Lobo anyway? Police Detective Kurt Lobo has been in the VirulentBlurb universe since before the war that cracked the skies. A wolf-splice, he lost his cat-splice wife Katrina when she was brutally murdered by... well, we'll get to that story eventually, and has been working cases for the police department with his partner Geldof (yes, he's a rat-splice) to try and keep some kind of law in a broken city.The case of The JackPort Killer is ritualistic. Bodies left, tortured and arranged, around the city with messages specifically for Kurt Lobo. Always killed by a rod jammed into the JackPort behind their ears. It starts with strangers and ends with... but I don't want to give the story away if you haven't heard it.Why an Audiobook? You just need to read the first paragraph of the story to realise that it is a transcription of an audio journal... so we want to give you that original audio experience; to hear the Wolf Splice detective record his own thoughts as the case of The JackPort Killer gets more brutal and more personal... you need to experience the case as it unfolds, as it happens. What we need the money for
We have struck a deal with London-based award winning studio Spokenworld Audio, winners this year of both an Audie (the Oscars of the audio world) and a New York Award for their work, and the production and distribution costs are sorted. All that is left now is to find the funding required to finish the project off and get all the parties in to the studio. This requires £2500. So we have loaded up the perks and crossed our fingers...
The search then began across the globe for a voice actor to bring Lobo to life in a way that excited both Kneel and the fans. After an extensive hunt, actor Greg Patmore of Big Finish fame was approached. 
Greg is from the industrial heart of England, son of a soldier and a nurse, with a childhood background in brass bands and community theatre. A working class boy, his expectations were set pretty low until he discovered music and theatre almost simultaneously in his mid teens.  He recently appeared with Kevin Costner and Bill Paxton as Good 'Lias Hatfield in the hit US series ""Hatfields & McCoys' which won 5 Emmys, and this year appeared with Bradley Walsh in the current series of 'Law & Order UK'. Subsequent appearances include 'Vera -The Deer Hunters' alongside Brenda Blethyn, and a role in new US TV series The Assets. He has appeared in several episodes of Coronation Street as thug Jonny Smith and has featured in David Morrissey's directorial debut film Don't Worry About Me and alongside John Henson and Neil Fitzmaurice in the British comedy feature Charlie Noades RIP.  He will next be seen on stage at the Edinburgh Festival with Anne Archer in Terry Jastrow's hard-hitting play 'The Trial of Jane Fonda'.  Watch his showreel  and see why we want him as our wolf.
We were all delighted when Greg read The JackPort Killer and loved it. He has excitedly agreed to the role and plans have been started to go into production of a full audio book. 
How can you help?
This is where you come in! There is a void that needs filling. The silence is unbearable.  The wolf must tell his tale...  Help us to give a voice to Detective Kurt Lobo.

Using Nancy's experience as a professional editor and Sarah's experience in publishing books, we honed our selections into a raw and diverse collection of poetry, prose, and art from over 80 contributors. We are almost ready to put it in your hands!</p><div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<ol>
<li>First and foremost, the goal of the book was to simply hold space for marginalized perspectives to emerge, and to grant them dignity and respect.</li>
<li>Second, we wanted to open up the lens of poverty and ask what this really means — who is in poverty? What do they look like? Could it be me or you? We wanted to minimize Othering, maximize empathy, and gather a wide range of viewpoints (which we are happy to say, we think we did).</li>
<li>Third, we hope that sharing these important perspectives will spark conversation about the pressing issues around us, and serve to shed light on the diverse realities of people living below the poverty line.</li>
<li>Then, we hope the conversations may inspire action.</li>
</ol>
</div><h2>What We Need</h2><p>We have very clear goals! </p><ul>
<li>$400 will cover the costs of printing &amp; shipping 82 books as contributor copies for each of our contributors -- some of which are outside the U.S.</li>
<li>$200 will allow us to print around 50 more copies to sell for a reasonable price without dipping into our personal budget.</li>
<li>$100 will cover the cost of the venue for the book launch on September 28th .</li>
<li>$100 is estimated to go toward fees, marketing and promotional materials.</li>
<li>Everything after that will go toward building a sleek website, releasing the next anthology, and possibly donating extra funds to a local organization that is doing excellent work in the community or otherwise linking tangible action to a social cause (for example, providing hot meals at our events to those in need).</li>

<blockquote><i>Do you want to join other poets, musicians, and artists around the USA and across the planet in a demonstration/celebration to promote peace and sustainability and  to call for serious social, environmental and political change?</i></blockquote>
<p>Yes, we do! We are coinciding our book release date with this global network! 100TPC uses the month of September to link poetry events all over the world under the umbrella of using poetry for social awareness. We will be launching Lucid Moose Lit and Gutters &amp; Alleyways on September 28th at St. Luke's Church in Long Beach, CA. <br/><br/>We hope to have an impact on our local community by involving some of the people with influence. If we raise enough money to make this a big event, we hope to attract <a href=""http://www.randomlengthsnews.com/sticking-to-the-subject-mayor-robert-garcia-on-poverty/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mayor Robert Garcia</a>, whose recent conversations have been directed at alleviating poverty in the city. He says on the subject:</p>
<blockquote>“I think sometimes people view poverty as someone on the verge of homelessness,” he says. “But you could walk by an apartment building in Alamitos Beach and never know that inside a one-bedroom apartment there could be eight people living there who are experiencing poverty...Poverty can look like anybody.""</blockquote>
<p>An astounding 22% of adults and 33% of children living in Long Beach are living in poverty, according to <a href=""http://www.lbcap.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page&amp;page_id=5001"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.lbcap.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page&amp;page_id=5001"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Long Beach Community Action Partnership</a>. This is what <i>Gutters and Alleyways</i> hopes to shed light on: the almost invisible yet scathing reality of poverty -- and the potential for building better and healthier lifestyles for all.  Stay tuned for more details about this event on September 28th!</p>

<p>The aim of <a href=""http://www.lucidmooselit.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lucid Moose Lit</a> is to be an activist press with one goal: improve the state of the world for humans, animals, and ecosystems by welcoming multiple perspectives on controversial topics. We aim to be inclusionary rather than exclusionary by bringing different views together in productive conversation. We want to plant the seeds of productive conversation.</p>
<p>As two poets with a background in sociology, social issues are important to both of us. I (Nancy) have always wanted a way to use poetry and art to affect positive change in the world. I would rather do this than anything else because I believe the first step to cultivating a better tomorrow is to begin and continue the conversations that matter. Since poetry helps spread empathy, Lucid Moose Lit aims to publish a wide variety of perspectives on important topics, while hosting events in our local community - so that we may do more than talk; we can start to build real connections with people who are doing work from the ground up.</p>
<p>Lucid Moose has big plans, from working with community organizations to releasing future anthologies. The next one is already in the works! We really need your help to get this important project off the ground and take next steps!</p>

An astounding 22% of adults and 33% of children living in Long Beach are living in poverty, according to Long Beach Community Action Partnership. This is what Gutters and Alleyways hopes to shed light on: the almost invisible yet scathing reality of poverty -- and the potential for building better and healthier lifestyles for all.  Stay tuned for more details about this event on September 28th!
Big Vision                        


The aim of Lucid Moose Lit is to be an activist press with one goal: improve the state of the world for humans, animals, and ecosystems by welcoming multiple perspectives on controversial topics. We aim to be inclusionary rather than exclusionary by bringing different views together in productive conversation. We want to plant the seeds of productive conversation.
As two poets with a background in sociology, social issues are important to both of us. I (Nancy) have always wanted a way to use poetry and art to affect positive change in the world. I would rather do this than anything else because I believe the first step to cultivating a better tomorrow is to begin and continue the conversations that matter. Since poetry helps spread empathy, Lucid Moose Lit aims to publish a wide variety of perspectives on important topics, while hosting events in our local community - so that we may do more than talk; we can start to build real connections with people who are doing work from the ground up.
Lucid Moose has big plans, from working with community organizations to releasing future anthologies. The next one is already in the works! We really need your help to get this important project off the ground and take next steps!

<p>Saturnalia Books’ mission is to publish literary works, primarily

collaboration between poets and visual artists, particularly in book form; and
to encourage the publication of literature of a non-commercial and challenging
nature.</p>

<p>In 2015, Saturnalia Books will publish
four texts and release a digital edition of a previously published text. New
titles will include books of poetry by Laurie Saurborn Young (<i>Industry of
Brief Distraction</i>), Sandra Simonds (<i>The Glass Box</i>), Michael Robins (<i>In
Memory of Brilliance &amp; Value</i>), and the winner of the Saturnalia Books
Poetry Prize, Jay Nebel (<i>Neighbors</i>), selected by Gerald Stern. <span></span></p>
We
will also expand and digitally enhance our popular 2010 collection of art and poetry, <i>Gurlesque</i>: the new grrly, grotesque, burlesque
poetics (ed. Lara Glenum and Arielle Greenberg). The new digital edition, <i>Electric Gurlesque</i>, will include more poets, artists, audio content, video content, hyperlinks, and
a teaching guide. “Gurlesque” is a term that
describes writers who perform femininity in their poems in a campy or overtly
mocking manner, risking the grotesque to shake the foundations of acceptable
female behavior and language. Built from the bric-a-brac of girl culture, these
works charm and repel: this work is fun, subversive, and important. Since its publication, <i>Gurlesque</i> has been utilized in college and university courses,
specifically those with an emphasis on Gender Studies. As such, Saturnalia
Books seeks to develop an enhanced digital edition that can be enjoyed by
individual readers and used to deepen the exploration of students and
professors. We believe that <i>Electric
Gurlesque</i> will be an experience like nothing else in the world of poetry!<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/917323/files/20141009111057-gurlesque.jpg?1412878257"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

We wanted to turn the page to see what other nuggets the author brought forth."" - Jury of Writer's Institute Madison University

About the authorHi, I'm Johanna, a San Francisco-based writer. How to love San Francisco - One year in the City by the Bay is bringing you the outside-in perspective of San Francisco. It's my declaration of love to my favorite city!Being a German native I wrote it in German -- getting it out to our English readers is the goal!This book is written for those of you, who look for information about San Francisco - wrapped in a fictional travel memoir  (that means: all the places described do exist, some of the characters are fictional). My previous work on San Francisco won the '2013 Writer's Institute' and was a semi-finalist of the Tuscon Festival of Books in Arizona. In Germany I was selected as a Top 50 non-fiction author. The German version of the book is one of the highest rated book in its category on Amazon.

<h3>Summary for <i>Imminent Danger And How to Fly Straight into It</i>
</h3>
<p>High school junior Eris Miller thinks she’s having a bad day when her roommate’s boyfriend catches her stepping out of the shower wearing nothing but a towel. Then she gets abducted by scaly six-armed aliens with a strange fondness for the color blue, and her day suddenly gets a whole lot worse. </p>
<p>Trapped on a spaceship bound for the slave markets of Sirius B, Eris fears she’ll never see her home again. But then fate whisks her away from her reptilian captors and into the arms of Varrin, a fast-talking space pirate who promises to deliver her safely back to Earth. He claims to have her best interests at heart, but Eris soon discovers that her charming rescuer has a hidden agenda. </p>
<p>As they race across the galaxy, outrunning a villainous figure from Varrin’s past, Eris begins to realize that their relationship is putting her planet, her life, and her heart in imminent danger. She knows that trusting Varrin could prove deadly … but what other choice does she have?</p>

<h3>What are readers saying?</h3>In a nutshell, they're pretty pleased with the book. Here are some excerpts from reviews to help sway you:<p></p>
<p><i>The story starts with a bang and ends with a smile that makes you want to say, “That’s just so Varrin.” I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good inter-galatic, wild and crazy adventure. This book has it all: alien abductions, human trafficking in space, galactic peace corporations, double-crossings, beautiful aliens, seduction, war, mysterious planets, and love gone strangely alien. I found myself lost in this book, caught up in the scenes, and air pumping my fist when things got exciting. A must buy. A must read. A must recommend. Congratulations to Michelle Proulx for being meticulous and getting it so right, I want to read it again.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">– Tania L Ramos (writingapocalypse.com)</p>
<p><i>I loved the zippy back-and-forth banter between the main characters; I loved the description of the different types of aliens; I loved how the relationships formed slowly while the main character focuses on surviving, and yet how she isn’t afraid to keep living even when things happen she can’t explain. This book is original and fun, and I’ll keep recommending it to people as often as I can.</i></p>

I love books and reading is such a big part of my life, but with school lately, I just never get the time. Of course, until I started reading Michelle’s book. I immediately was lost in Imminent Danger, so lost I read over 200 pages in about 4 hours. I simply couldn’t put the book down. Every ten minutes or so I kept telling myself, “Just put the book down…” Nope. This story dragged me into Alien spaceships, witty arguments, laser guns, and highly advanced technology with so many different Alien species and names it felt like I was right there with Eris. It was just a load of fun to read, and I’m pretty sure I’ll read it again. It’s a mind blower. I’m not much of an Alien fan, but boy did this story change my mind. It was just fantastic, and I am glad I got the chance to read it. I could imagine everything so vividly; everything was described well enough to get that clear picture of any character you ran into. Every cliffhanger at the end of each chapter just kept me so intrigued In the book; I just couldn’t stand the thought of leaving Michelle’s beautiful world. I still have alien warships shooting their plasma cannons and so many different types of aliens running around in my head.

<p><i>Chasing Nonconformity! </i>This sequel to <i>Imminent Danger </i>is nearly done with editing and proofreading and should be available Spring 2015.

I am a Christian author and blogger named Barry Irwin Brophy inviting you to help combat human trafficking through fiction. The project I am requesting funds for is to publish a novel I have written called A Woman's Choice that follows the broken life of a rescued human trafficked victim named Katrina originally taken from Albania. Since her captivity, she has fallen into a life of drug addiction and promiscuity leading her to homelessness and a crude job as a bikini barista to fuel her addiction. She discovers she is pregnant and must decide whether to keep or terminate the pregnancy. Her choice in this matter begins a search for the meaning of life and what role Christianity plays in understanding the purpose of life and suffering. Throughout the novel I expose the methods of human trafficking experienced by rescued victims as well as address topics of abortion, sexual immorality, poverty, and drug addiction.<br/><br/>Half of all the profits made from my novel will be donated to The Defenders Foundation and The Genesis Project to fight local human trafficking. The story of my novel, opinions, and experiences of the characters in my novel do not necessarily reflect the mission and values of The Defenders Foundation or The Genesis Project. <br/><br/><b>What do your contributions pay for?</b><br/>Your contributions will pay for a publishing package from a self-publishing book company that will copy edit my novel, publish the final copy in paperback, hard copy, and ebook formats, copyright registration, a press release, and video trailer. The press release and video trailer will be marketed to journalists and newspapers across the nation.<br/><br/><b>What happens to any extra funds that are contributed to this project if they surpass the original goal?</b><br/>These excess funds will be donated to The Defenders Foundation and The Genesis Project.<br/><br/><b>What happens to the funds that are contributed to this project if the goal is not met?</b><br/>The funds will be set aside until I am able to generate my goal of $7000.

I am a Christian author and blogger named Barry Irwin Brophy inviting you to help combat human trafficking through fiction. The project I am requesting funds for is to publish a novel I have written called A Woman's Choice that follows the broken life of a rescued human trafficked victim named Katrina originally taken from Albania. Since her captivity, she has fallen into a life of drug addiction and promiscuity leading her to homelessness and a crude job as a bikini barista to fuel her addiction. She discovers she is pregnant and must decide whether to keep or terminate the pregnancy. Her choice in this matter begins a search for the meaning of life and what role Christianity plays in understanding the purpose of life and suffering. Throughout the novel I expose the methods of human trafficking experienced by rescued victims as well as address topics of abortion, sexual immorality, poverty, and drug addiction.Half of all the profits made from my novel will be donated to The Defenders Foundation and The Genesis Project to fight local human trafficking. The story of my novel, opinions, and experiences of the characters in my novel do not necessarily reflect the mission and values of The Defenders Foundation or The Genesis Project. What do your contributions pay for?Your contributions will pay for a publishing package from a self-publishing book company that will copy edit my novel, publish the final copy in paperback, hard copy, and ebook formats, copyright registration, a press release, and video trailer. The press release and video trailer will be marketed to journalists and newspapers across the nation.What happens to any extra funds that are contributed to this project if they surpass the original goal?These excess funds will be donated to The Defenders Foundation and The Genesis Project.What happens to the funds that are contributed to this project if the goal is not met?The funds will be set aside until I am able to generate my goal of $7000. Indiegogo will take 9% of the funds as a fee. Because I cannot guarantee the availability of hard copies and paperback copies of my novel, under this scenario, all contributors will receive an audio copy of The Weak and Foolish Things of Seattle.

Receiving a mix of one particular artist from a friend made me wonder what I had been missing by not having been exposed to that artist.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Stina Leicht, and I'm a Science Fiction/Fantasy author. My first two novels were published by Night Shade Books. (The first book is titled <em><strong>Of Blood and Honey</strong></em> and the second is called <em><strong>And Blue Skies from Pain</strong></em>.) I was recently nominated for a 2012 Campbell Award for Best New Novelist. The awards ceremony will be held in Chicago, Illinois during Chicon 7-- a SF/F convention. It's a huge honor to be nominated. Huge. Authors can only be nominated twice--ever. Needless to say, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. (Okay. Twice. But twice is unlikely.) Unfortunately, I can't afford to attend the ceremony as things stand. I really, really don't want to miss it. I've always wanted to be a writer and this means the world to me.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $2000 for the trip to Chicago. The money will go to the cost of the flight ($600), transportation to the hotel and the airport ($50), hotel ($725), meals ($350), and contributions to two hotel parties to help promote the books.</p>
<p>Anyone who contributes at any level will get their name mentioned in thanks at the end of my next book. (Which I'm working on right now and am almost finished with the first draft. The working title is <em><strong>Cold Iron</strong></em>.)</p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>My name is Ashley Jenkins. What you need to know about me is that I have a passion not only for Yoga, but for helping others. In fact, perhaps I’m a bit different than most would-be Yoga book authors, since the decision to take on this project didn't originate with me. Actually, I was asked to write this book by my fellow peers and students. <br/><br/> Overall, I think they appreciate my Mid-Western/Heinz 57 approach to teaching. But they also told me they were looking for something that went beyond the Yoga sessions.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, they wanted a resource that would allow them to sequence conscious practices that would inspire personal evolution and transformation. For many this meant having something they could use during their busy workday – a guide with fresh, innovative ways to incorporate Yoga at their work stations. Others told me they wanted a quick reference for Yoga pose alignment, such as the “maha” pose/asana; while still others were seeking something that provided more spiritual aspects like a pathway to self-empowerment to increase healing of their body/mind/spirit.</p>
<span id=""internal-source-marker_0.5702570302819527"" style=""font-size: 19px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;""></span>
</div>
<div>
<p>There are <em>many</em> Yoga books. A new Yoga book pops up on Amazon every day (well, almost). Our objective is to share an American perspective on modern lineages that have crossed paths, integrated, and brought forth new truth in the healing process of Yoga. When an individual is whole, there is much more that can be realized from their offering to benefit the collective.</p>
<h3><strong>This book will highlight safe progression in practice.</strong></h3>
<p>There will be show-stopping poses/Asanas available for practice. Some will be discussed and demonstrated in our first edition of <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>Krama, Yoga Chronologically: An Approach to Embodying Yoga</em></span>. In these chronological tales of Yogic expression, our intention is to prepare the tissues and prerequisites in practice, to empower individuals to eradicate injurious setbacks or stagnation. <br/><br/> We know <em><strong>you</strong></em> are eager to achieve certain goals (possibly touching your toes or standing on your head). We want to encourage you, inspire you, and cheer you all the way there; but it does not happen overnight. Yoga is a process, not a product. We seek to cut through the illusions and expectations, giving you palpable methods to transform your journey.</p>
<p>Translating the science within Yoga, we will explore the ancestry of the traditions and bodily technologies of Yoga from the East, and the parallels of these in Western adaptations. The examination, process and progression of embodiment within this text gives each practitioner the keys for unlocking their powerful and unique potential.<br/><br/> Physically, we desire to see results. Yes. But the rich inner context of this book explores the layers of behavior, thought process, and emotional blockage through the cultivation of <em>powerful</em> themes and the quest for truth. It’s the inside out approach.</p>
<p>Captivating everyone with the unique and quirky lens we hold on Yoga, our intention is to visually and mentally stimulate our audience, inspiring all readers to do Yoga whenever, wherever, and allowing their process to be one of curiosity, compassion, and play.<br/><br/> The ability to carve out space to sustain bliss (yes, if only for nanoseconds) is within your grasp from chronologically moving, <em>Krama</em> in practice.</p>

For many this meant having something they could use during their busy workday – a guide with fresh, innovative ways to incorporate Yoga at their work stations. Others told me they wanted a quick reference for Yoga pose alignment, such as the “maha” pose/asana; while still others were seeking something that provided more spiritual aspects like a pathway to self-empowerment to increase healing of their body/mind/spirit.



There are many Yoga books. A new Yoga book pops up on Amazon every day (well, almost). Our objective is to share an American perspective on modern lineages that have crossed paths, integrated, and brought forth new truth in the healing process of Yoga. When an individual is whole, there is much more that can be realized from their offering to benefit the collective.
This book will highlight safe progression in practice.
There will be show-stopping poses/Asanas available for practice. Some will be discussed and demonstrated in our first edition of Krama, Yoga Chronologically: An Approach to Embodying Yoga. In these chronological tales of Yogic expression, our intention is to prepare the tissues and prerequisites in practice, to empower individuals to eradicate injurious setbacks or stagnation.  We know you are eager to achieve certain goals (possibly touching your toes or standing on your head). We want to encourage you, inspire you, and cheer you all the way there; but it does not happen overnight. Yoga is a process, not a product. We seek to cut through the illusions and expectations, giving you palpable methods to transform your journey.
Translating the science within Yoga, we will explore the ancestry of the traditions and bodily technologies of Yoga from the East, and the parallels of these in Western adaptations. The examination, process and progression of embodiment within this text gives each practitioner the keys for unlocking their powerful and unique potential. Physically, we desire to see results. Yes. But the rich inner context of this book explores the layers of behavior, thought process, and emotional blockage through the cultivation of powerful themes and the quest for truth. It’s the inside out approach.
Captivating everyone with the unique and quirky lens we hold on Yoga, our intention is to visually and mentally stimulate our audience, inspiring all readers to do Yoga whenever, wherever, and allowing their process to be one of curiosity, compassion, and play. The ability to carve out space to sustain bliss (yes, if only for nanoseconds) is within your grasp from chronologically moving, Krama in practice.

<h3>The Story of Wander Lust: The Chocolate Made Me Do It</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In life, we often have a picture of how we think the future will look. The picture is so clear to us, we can embrace it as if it has already come into existence. What do we do when we become so attached to a vision of how things should be that we lose sight of how things are?  When we are scared to alter our current course for fear it will change our future.<br/><br/>Take a moment to evaluate your day. Is it filled with draining people, boring routines, and an overwhelming desire for more? What if you stepped outside of your ordinary day-to-day and tried something different? Sure, it’s easy to dream about, but there are a million reasons why we just keep on keeping on. Sitting with our excuses and spending many of our days living out the monotonous moments creates complacency. in turn, all we can do is long for more.  When we alter the course, each moment becomes something so much more impactful. It changes our perspectives. It changes us.<br/><br/>My name is Devon Werner and I am the author of Wander Lust: The Chocolate Made Me Do It. I wrote this book as a way to chronicle my adventures and reflect upon the happenstance of my life. The process of writing this book made me realize that I wanted to share my story with others who may need to read it. I have been through some difficult moments in my life and found it helpful to read about others who had similar experiences.

In life, we often have a picture of how we think the future will look. The picture is so clear to us, we can embrace it as if it has already come into existence. What do we do when we become so attached to a vision of how things should be that we lose sight of how things are?  When we are scared to alter our current course for fear it will change our future.Take a moment to evaluate your day. Is it filled with draining people, boring routines, and an overwhelming desire for more? What if you stepped outside of your ordinary day-to-day and tried something different? Sure, it’s easy to dream about, but there are a million reasons why we just keep on keeping on. Sitting with our excuses and spending many of our days living out the monotonous moments creates complacency. in turn, all we can do is long for more.  When we alter the course, each moment becomes something so much more impactful. It changes our perspectives. It changes us.My name is Devon Werner and I am the author of Wander Lust: The Chocolate Made Me Do It. I wrote this book as a way to chronicle my adventures and reflect upon the happenstance of my life.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm Retsu Motoyoshi, a filmmaker based in Brooklyn, and one of the members of this project, House of Desires. Currently I’m working on the photo book of an abandoned brothel in Osaka. I’m sure that many of you have visited well-known tourist areas such as Tokyo, Kyoto, and Mt. Fuji, but I doubt any of you have been to the old red-light districts.</p>
<p>Yukaku, the Japanese name for these red-light districts, existed from the first half of 17<sup>th</sup> century until the postwar period. A Yukaku was a neighborhood containing government-approved brothels which were surrounded by walls and moats. Yoshiwara Yukaku, in Edo (the old name for Tokyo), was one of the most famous examples. In fact, many manga and Japanese movies have stories set in brothels, including “Damon Slayer”, a box office hit in 2020, and the Japanese classic “Street of Shame” by Kenji Mizoguchi. That explains why many Japanese people are interested in Yukaku as a part of their history.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615047267/qzaz7dml2p4yxeotw4gr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Left</strong> : <i>Demon Slayer - Yukaku Hen</i> (2021)           <strong>Right</strong> : <i>Street of Shame</i> (1956)</p>
<p>Nowadays, more and more foreigners have become interested in old Japanese brothels through these manga and movies, as well as through social media, when other tourists share photos of their visits to these now-shuttered brothels.</p>
<p>For this project, we decided to make a photo book of Masumi, a brothel built in 1929 and has been empty for the past 20 years, collecting the memories of brothels that remain in their abandoned state. Through this we can keep a record of the history of Japanese brothels, their architecture, and characteristics. Through what remains of Masumi, we can learn much about the culture and customs of historic brothels before it's demolished.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/ygylhHD7idkaCxspnQ/source.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Without a doubt, we don’t justify prostitution. The brothel system that existed before women’s rights was a shameful part of our history. We cannot ignore that women who worked as prostitutes in brothels at that time were victims of human trafficking. And of course we agree with the criticisms of the brothel system, but we still believe that visualizing what is disappearing and showing its value is one of our roles as journalists. And, surely Masumi has that value. Part of the revenues of this book will be donated to an NGO that supports women working in the sex industry. Additionally, revenues will be used for repairing and maintaining the Masumi building, and for preserving the personal effects that were left behind.</p>

<p><strong>Here we share the preface of the book, written by Tadashi Shinohara, our editor.</strong></p>
<p><i>In Osaka, Japan’s second largest city, there is a neighborhood called Tobita Shinchi. Full of wooden houses, the architecture retains the feeling of the past. This </i><i>area</i><i> bustled with people when it was a government approved red-light district. With the full enforcement of the Anti-Prostitution Act in 1958, many red-light districts disappeared in Japan, though Tobita Shinchi still retains its original ambience.</i></p>
<p><i>At the edge of Tobita Shinchi, there is an old wooden house with a sign that </i><i>reads “</i><i>Masumi</i><i>”</i><i>.</i></p>
<p><i>During the time when prostitution was approved by the government, it was a </i><i>lively</i><i> place with a large number of prostitutes who provided fleeting pleasure to their numerous clients. Even after the enforcement of the Anti-Prostitution Act, Masumi continued operating as a brothel, though under the guise of a </i><i>restaurant,</i><i> </i><i>as</i><i> was a typical practice in Tobita Shinchi. Masumi finally closed down about 20 years ago and now lies abandoned and forgotten by time.</i></p>
<p><i>The building is now quite deteriorated after being exposed to rain and wind for many years.</i></p>
<p><i>Some of the roof tiles have come off, the interior is full of dust</i><i>,</i><i> and some wooden floor panels have become detached. Yet once you open the rusty shutters and enter, Masumi unveils a vivid remnant of the brothel era.</i></p>
<p><i>Next to the entrance facing the main street, there is a</i><i> stylish </i><i>room that looks like a dance floor. </i></p>
<p><i>Upon opening the drawers of the abandoned bar counter, you can still find some old menus and </i><i>name tags of women who </i><i>likely</i><i> worked there. Each one of the small rooms on the second floor is </i><i>outfitted with varying</i><i> designs</i><i>,</i><i> such as a ceiling shaped like the bottom of a boat, </i><i>or</i><i> an alcove with a curved log in the shape of driftwood. One can also find a hallway with a red felted carpet</i><i>,</i><i> cobblestone </i><i>alleys</i><i> on each side, </i><i>and </i><i>windows and stairs with moon motifs. These designs come from a time — between the Taisho period (1912-1926) and the beginning of Showa period (1926-1989) when Western culture was considered modern and fashionable.</i></p>
<p><i>Tobita Shinchi lost a lot of its sumptuous wooden architecture during the air raids of World</i></p>
<p><i>War II and was neglected in the economic development after the war. There are only a few wooden brothels from that period </i><i>remaining</i><i> today. Although Masumi is now abandoned, it is still a treasure trove that provides a glimpse into the brothels that once thrived in this neighborhood. It is important to acknowledge that these brothels and red-light districts stood accused of numerous injustices, including human trafficking and the exploitation of women</i><i>, and it may well</i><i> be the same for Tobita Shinchi. Nevertheless, we believe that leaving a record of Masumi before it is demolished contributes to the social and architectural history of Japan. We hope you find this single journey through the country’s brothel culture of interest as it is fading fast from Japanese memory.</i></p>
<p><i>–Tadashi Shinohara</i></p>

05: Preserving the past by Shinichiro Kaneda, writer and journalist
    Why it is important to preserve what exists now before it disappears. An essay by an experienced journalist.






 
Here we share the preface of the book, written by Tadashi Shinohara, our editor.
In Osaka, Japan’s second largest city, there is a neighborhood called Tobita Shinchi. Full of wooden houses, the architecture retains the feeling of the past. This area bustled with people when it was a government approved red-light district. With the full enforcement of the Anti-Prostitution Act in 1958, many red-light districts disappeared in Japan, though Tobita Shinchi still retains its original ambience.
At the edge of Tobita Shinchi, there is an old wooden house with a sign that reads “Masumi”.
During the time when prostitution was approved by the government, it was a lively place with a large number of prostitutes who provided fleeting pleasure to their numerous clients. Even after the enforcement of the Anti-Prostitution Act, Masumi continued operating as a brothel, though under the guise of a restaurant, as was a typical practice in Tobita Shinchi. Masumi finally closed down about 20 years ago and now lies abandoned and forgotten by time.
The building is now quite deteriorated after being exposed to rain and wind for many years.
Some of the roof tiles have come off, the interior is full of dust, and some wooden floor panels have become detached. Yet once you open the rusty shutters and enter, Masumi unveils a vivid remnant of the brothel era.
Next to the entrance facing the main street, there is a stylish room that looks like a dance floor. 
Upon opening the drawers of the abandoned bar counter, you can still find some old menus and name tags of women who likely worked there. Each one of the small rooms on the second floor is outfitted with varying designs, such as a ceiling shaped like the bottom of a boat, or an alcove with a curved log in the shape of driftwood. One can also find a hallway with a red felted carpet, cobblestone alleys on each side, and windows and stairs with moon motifs. These designs come from a time — between the Taisho period (1912-1926) and the beginning of Showa period (1926-1989) when Western culture was considered modern and fashionable.
Tobita Shinchi lost a lot of its sumptuous wooden architecture during the air raids of World
War II and was neglected in the economic development after the war. There are only a few wooden brothels from that period remaining today. Although Masumi is now abandoned, it is still a treasure trove that provides a glimpse into the brothels that once thrived in this neighborhood. It is important to acknowledge that these brothels and red-light districts stood accused of numerous injustices, including human trafficking and the exploitation of women, and it may well be the same for Tobita Shinchi. Nevertheless, we believe that leaving a record of Masumi before it is demolished contributes to the social and architectural history of Japan. We hope you find this single journey through the country’s brothel culture of interest as it is fading fast from Japanese memory.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am the author of seven previous books: <i>Mal Occhio: The Underside of Vision </i>(North Point Press: 1981), <i>Dream Streets:The Big Book of Italian American Culture </i>(Harper &amp; Row: 1989), and <i>Una Storia Segreta: The Secret History of Italian American Evacuation and Internment During World War II </i>(Heyday Books: 2001), with both <i>Mal Occhio</i> and the <i>Big Book</i> now reprinted under my own Sanniti Publications imprint. Also under the Sanniti imprint are: <i>Esty: A Novel/Memoir </i>(Sanniti: 2012); <i>Branded: How Italian Immigrants Became ‘Enemies’ During WWII </i>(Sanniti: 2016); <i>Earth Breath: Selected Blogs, 2009-2016 </i>(Sanniti: 2017) and <i>Suspect Love: a novel set in WWII San Francisco when Italian Immigrants were 'enemy aliens'</i> (Sanniti: 2018).  </p>
<p>As with my previous books, I am choosing to launch <i>Family Matter  </i>by starting with a crowd-funded campaign--this to finance the novel's debut under my own imprint, Sanniti Publications, and to help with publicity. After that, it's anybody's guess. </p>
<p>By joining in this effort, donors can help to mitigate some of the risk (and publishing novels in today's climate is a decided risk), while acting as the book's primary readers and supporters.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In days gone by, book publishers often relied on “angels,” wealthy donors who wanted to associate with the gentile world of publishing. Now each donor, as a lover of literature, can become a kind of “angel” for this book—helping to get <i>Family Matter </i>into print in order to reach the many readers who still value well-crafted fiction. </p>
<p>   The book is designed and print-ready. For a modest initial print run, and a little attendant publicity, I've calculated that I need about $1500. to print a novel that runs to some 400 pages. </p>
<p>   Here’s how you can help. For a donation of $50., you get an autographed copy of the book. For $100., you get two autographed copies (give them as gifts). Donors who give $150. will receive the two copies and be mentioned in print as <strong>Sponsors</strong> on the Acknowledgments page. Beyond that, a $200 donor will be acknowledged in print as a <strong>Patron</strong>, and for $300 and up, you will be noted as an <strong>Angel</strong>. Please understand that to be acknowledged in the printed volume, the donation must be received before we go to press on or about May 22. If there should be a second or third printing, we should be able to acknowledge donors who miss this initial deadline. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The satisfying element here is cooperation. Mainstream publishing, now as cutthroat as Wall Street, is devoted mainly to finding the next blockbuster, while serious fiction has become an endangered species. It is for this reason that I started my own imprint in the first place, and that I am now venturing into publishing another novel.</p>
<p>By joining me in this effort, everyone can be a part of bringing this story--of a son coming upon the secret of his father's origins in Italy, and much more--to a reading public that has been trained to expect sensationalism of a specific kind from such stories. Cooperating to expand the range of what's expected in print may not bring instant change, but it does offer the chance to have an impact on what's to come.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As noted above, publishing as an independent represents substantial risks, especially in the areas of publicity and distribution. As an established author, with dozens of years of contacts in the Italian American community, I have a kind of network to help with both strands. But it would be foolish to underestimate the risks. That is why use of print-on-demand--which I have used in two previous books--helps. It provides both distribution networks and the chance to publish in small-enough quantities to avoid costly print overruns and inventory warehousing. Together with my networks built over the years, I'm hopeful that <i>Family Matter</i> will prove to be a secure investment. And one never knows when a novel like this will catch fire. </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
</div><div>
<p>Even if you cannot contribute monetarily, you can still help get the word out. Indiegogo offers tools that allow you to spread the word on the web via social media. As an individual, you can tell your friends both about the book, and about this campaign. Suggest <i>Family Matter</i> as a great gift book. Every effort, no matter its size or reach, will contribute to the whole, and be greatly appreciated. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is <strong>Maddox Marie</strong>, and I am the author of <i>Indimite</i>. </p>
<p>I'm writing this book because I love stories about ordinary people with extraordinary abilities. In every story, those with superpowers are feared, hated or loved, but they are always special. The phrase <i>'if everyone's special, no-one is'</i> came to mind, and I wondered how true that was. </p>
<p><i>What if</i> everyone was special? <i>What if </i>there was a world where everyone had a superpower?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal with this series is to entertain and to build a rich and diverse world that provides a place to escape to and that inspires others to write their own stories. </p>
<p>With <i>Indimite</i>, I want to explore themes such as redemption, asking if anyone ever reaches a point where they are beyond saving. I want to explore how a friendship between two characters that are, in many ways, each other's opposites can ignite change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These characters are; Shay and Celeste.</p>
<p><strong>Shay</strong> used to be a superhero. She saved the day from <i>Indimites</i> (those who use their powers to kill others). However, before the story has even begun, Shay was fired. Because of that, she struggles with depression and a sense of purposelessness.</p>
<p><strong>Celeste </strong>grew up in a community that cut itself off from the rest of the world, and that forbids the use of powers. She is told over and over that powers are the work of the devil and that everyone outside her community is evil. After she loses control of her powers and causes the sacred songbird to escape, she is shunned. Determined to set things right, Celeste leaves the safety of her community and ventures into the outside world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the moment they meet their lives are entangled, and Shay has to teach Celeste to control her power. If she fails, it's both of their lives that are at stake.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Can Shay help Celeste in time, and stop her from becoming an<i> Indimite</i>?</p>

My name is Maddox Marie, and I am the author of Indimite. 
I'm writing this book because I love stories about ordinary people with extraordinary abilities. In every story, those with superpowers are feared, hated or loved, but they are always special. The phrase 'if everyone's special, no-one is' came to mind, and I wondered how true that was. 
What if everyone was special? What if there was a world where everyone had a superpower?
 
My goal with this series is to entertain and to build a rich and diverse world that provides a place to escape to and that inspires others to write their own stories. 
With Indimite, I want to explore themes such as redemption, asking if anyone ever reaches a point where they are beyond saving. I want to explore how a friendship between two characters that are, in many ways, each other's opposites can ignite change.
 
These characters are; Shay and Celeste.
Shay used to be a superhero. She saved the day from Indimites (those who use their powers to kill others). However, before the story has even begun, Shay was fired. Because of that, she struggles with depression and a sense of purposelessness.
Celeste grew up in a community that cut itself off from the rest of the world, and that forbids the use of powers. She is told over and over that powers are the work of the devil and that everyone outside her community is evil. After she loses control of her powers and causes the sacred songbird to escape, she is shunned. Determined to set things right, Celeste leaves the safety of her community and ventures into the outside world.
 
From the moment they meet their lives are entangled, and Shay has to teach Celeste to control her power. If she fails, it's both of their lives that are at stake.
 
Can Shay help Celeste in time, and stop her from becoming an Indimite?
 
 
For those who like...
Superpowers, the fantasy genre, redemption stories or unlikely friendships.

The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish in the summer of 2021

 
When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will be able to publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. And when I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook!!!! 
I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

My first published play, ""Dover Escapade"" was adopted by the school system as its ""must perform"" junior high school play for about ten years. With that, I became an author. My newest collection of poems,  MY LIFE REVEALED: FIFTEEN TO SIXTY FIVE"" is my collection of poems reflective of each year of my formative adult life. The catalyst to publish was THE WREN. Read about it in one of the poems.

My first published play, ""Dover Escapade"" was adopted by the school system as its ""must perform"" junior high school play for about ten years. With that, I became an author.

<p></p><h3>Tools to Change Yourself and the World<br/>
</h3><p></p><p><br/></p><p>Hi, I'm Justin Charles Beck. My spiritual journey began in
1997 when my partner and wife of 13 years died of non-hodgkins lymphoma/cancer.
As a full time caregiver and true believer in her recovery, I was tossed into a
world of loss and uncertainty when she passed. Rediscovering myself became a
full time occupation and creating a meaningful life became my focus. Through the
continuous study of kabbalah, the ancient spiritual wisdom, with masters in the
US and Israel, I implemented practical tools to restructure and give greater
meaning to my my life. I have now entered the phase of sharing the gift of this
useful knowledge to students in Fairfield Ct in a weekly course with all
proceeds going to a charitable nonprofit organization. 
</p><p>A main understanding of kabbalah is to receive with intent
to share. By taking this proactive step and creating this manual for living,
with your help, we can share with those who seek a fuller more connected life.</p>
<p>My total focus during the process of writing this book will
be how the reader can most quickly and effectively absorb the information and
put it to practical use in their lives. Unlike other books on this subject I
will delve immediately into the features and benefits and practical
applications. For those that require historical proofs and foundational
groundwork, I will refer them to great existing texts or websites, of which
there are many. </p>
<p>Readers will be engrossed and empowered through my ability
to articulate concepts onto the written page that connect with their intellect
and emotion as a bi-product of my previous professional business plan, screenplay writing experience, worldly travels and spiritual experiences. All referenced sources are established and credible. <br/></p>
<p><b>I am passionate about helping others
help themselves.</b></p>
<p>We live in a physical reality understood through the prism
of cause and effect. Through the act of free will each of us has the ability to
not only directly alter our own our path but indirectly alter the course of the
future of all mankind and creation. Every thought, spoken word, and action
creates a reality. This book will assist in choosing them wisely. As the saying
goes: ""chop your own wood and it will warm you twice"" - as does your
participation in creating this reality.</p>
<p>The money I raise through this campaign will cover the costs
of design, editing, production and printing, distribution, and 10% will be
donated to a charity/non-profit.</p>
<p><b>Thank you so much for your support.</b></p>
<p>I thank your for your contribution to this project. The
immediate practical application of this ancient wisdom will be available to all
who seek it. Your contribution has positive benefits to you in this lifetime,
previous, and future, and creates a positive ripple effect which reverberates
throughout. </p>
<p>In addition to the benefits listed above, for your support
you will be the first to receive a copy of this life changing book. I am also
offering extra perks for greater participation.</p>
<p>I want to thank all my teachers, guides, study partners and
mentors who with humility and love have shared their knowledge and abilities to
help bring me to this place.They primarily include Rabbi Reuven Wolf, Rabbi Mordecai Finley, Rabbi Yitzchak Schwartz, Rabbi Danny Yiftach, Rabbi Gedalia Fleer, Rabbi Avraham Sutton, Rabbi Avraham Greenbaum, Rabbi Avraham Trugman, Rabbi Naomi Levy, Rabbi Yitzchok Adlerstein, Rabbi Ozer Bergman, Rabbi Shalom Brodt, Rabbi Eyal Rav-Noy, Rabbi Shlame Landa, Yedidya Blanton, Avi Schira, David Saks, Jonathan Omer-Man, Nahar Shalom Yeshiva, Simchat Shlomo Yeshiva, Chabad, Aish Hatorah, and Kabbalah Center Los Angeles.

<p><em><br/></em>Thank you so much for your generosity and support in helping us reach our original $2,500 goal. We are now hoping to reach $3,500 to give our programs the extra boost they deserve!</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Receipts for donations will be provided upon request. Check out<strong> <a href=""http://student.uncw.edu/org/gsa/constitution.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our nonprofit status</a></strong> on the UNCW GSA website (scroll to the bottom of the linked page). </em></p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The UNCW CRWGSA (how's that for an acronymn?) is a student organization at University of North Carolina Wilmington that provides channels for its <a href=""http://uncw.edu/writers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Creative Writing MFA</strong></a> students to share their work, connect with other writers, and assist in the fostering of new writers through multiple outreach programs.</p>
<p>The CRWGSA funds <strong>The Reading Series</strong>, an annual calendar of public readings put on by our students. We also bring acclaimed writers to Wilmington for public readings through programs such as the <strong>AWP Benefit Reading Series</strong>. By hosting as many as eight readings per year, we strive to encourage culture and literacy in the community.</p>
<p>One of the CRWGSA's most important responsibilities is sending our students to the <a href=""https://www.awpwriter.org/awp_conference/overview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>AWP Conference</strong></a>, where they and thousands of other writers attend readings, craft lectures, and teaching panels. By providing our students the opportunity to attend AWP through travel reimbursement, we provide enrichment and an opportunity to engage in the global writing community.</p>
<p>This year, we are also reinvigorating our involvement with the UNCW Creative Writing Department's various <strong><a href=""http://uncw.edu/writers/camp.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Outreach Programs</a></strong>. We would like to fund <em>at least one scholarship</em> for a high school writer to attend the <strong>Young Writers Workshop</strong> in Summer 2013 (and with your help, would love to fund many more).</p>
<p>We also aim to contribute to <strong>Writers in Action</strong>, a program that sends our MFA students to nearby public schools to teach creative writing to students who might otherwise not be exposed to it, and <strong>Teens Out Loud</strong>, a writing workshop our students <span>offer t</span>o local teens diagnosed with HIV and AIDS. By supporting a new generation of writers, we hope not only to encourage literature but also encourage literacy in a state where more than <strong>one in ten people struggle with reading and writing.</strong></p>
<p>This holiday season, we ask that you donate a little (or a lot) to help send our writers into the local and the global writing communities, to share the word about literature and literacy.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Budget cuts across the board at state schools such as ours mean that our resources have been drained. Without your help, the CRWGSA will not be able to fund many of its programs this year. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>What we need:</strong></p>
<p>At least $2500, which (after IndieGoGo fees and incentive costs have been subtracted) will be used to fund our various programs. If we meet our goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>$500 will go to a Young Writers Workshop scholarship<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>$1200 will help send 20-30 students to AWP 2013 in Boston<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>$200 will fund Reading Series events for the 2012-2013 school year<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>$100 will go toward bringing in an AWP Benefit Reader</li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining money will go toward increasing resources for <strong>Writers in Action</strong> and <strong>Teens Out Loud</strong>. As we exceed our goal, we will continue to fund these programs at approximately the same percentages. <br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>What you get:</strong></p>
<p>Literary goodies!</p>

Receipts for donations will be provided upon request. Check out our nonprofit status on the UNCW GSA website (scroll to the bottom of the linked page). 
Our Story
The UNCW CRWGSA (how's that for an acronymn?) is a student organization at University of North Carolina Wilmington that provides channels for its Creative Writing MFA students to share their work, connect with other writers, and assist in the fostering of new writers through multiple outreach programs.
The CRWGSA funds The Reading Series, an annual calendar of public readings put on by our students. We also bring acclaimed writers to Wilmington for public readings through programs such as the AWP Benefit Reading Series. By hosting as many as eight readings per year, we strive to encourage culture and literacy in the community.
One of the CRWGSA's most important responsibilities is sending our students to the AWP Conference, where they and thousands of other writers attend readings, craft lectures, and teaching panels. By providing our students the opportunity to attend AWP through travel reimbursement, we provide enrichment and an opportunity to engage in the global writing community.
This year, we are also reinvigorating our involvement with the UNCW Creative Writing Department's various Outreach Programs. We would like to fund at least one scholarship for a high school writer to attend the Young Writers Workshop in Summer 2013 (and with your help, would love to fund many more).
We also aim to contribute to Writers in Action, a program that sends our MFA students to nearby public schools to teach creative writing to students who might otherwise not be exposed to it, and Teens Out Loud, a writing workshop our students offer to local teens diagnosed with HIV and AIDS. By supporting a new generation of writers, we hope not only to encourage literature but also encourage literacy in a state where more than one in ten people struggle with reading and writing.
This holiday season, we ask that you donate a little (or a lot) to help send our writers into the local and the global writing communities, to share the word about literature and literacy.
 
The Impact


Budget cuts across the board at state schools such as ours mean that our resources have been drained. Without your help, the CRWGSA will not be able to fund many of its programs this year. 


 
What We Need & What You Get
What we need:
At least $2500, which (after IndieGoGo fees and incentive costs have been subtracted) will be used to fund our various programs. If we meet our goal:

$500 will go to a Young Writers Workshop scholarship

$1200 will help send 20-30 students to AWP 2013 in Boston

$200 will fund Reading Series events for the 2012-2013 school year

$100 will go toward bringing in an AWP Benefit Reader

The remaining money will go toward increasing resources for Writers in Action and Teens Out Loud. As we exceed our goal, we will continue to fund these programs at approximately the same percentages. 
What you get:
Literary goodies!
Our team of students are working hard on designing bookmarks, broadsides, stickers, and t-shirts for you at low donation levels.
One free issue of Ecotone, a Chautauqua bundle, and copies of Edith Pearlman's award-winning Binocular Vision from Lookout Books are up for grabs.
Signed books from our alumni, including Carmen Rodrigues and Daniel Nathan Terry.
Signed books and bundles from our illustrious faculty are available for donations starting at $100.
MFA Alumna Rebecca Petruck's manuscript critique has been claimed! Thank you so much for your generosity and thank you so much to Rebecca for volunteering her services!
Donors of $600 and up will have a Young Writers Workshop scholarship created in their name, as well as a personal letter from the student whose attendance was made possible by the scholarship.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Paulette Kouffman Sherman is a breast cancer survivor who is a psychologist, life coach and author.  She was told the day before her 41st birthday that her cancer had a 25% chance of coming back and she just completed a year-long treatment of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.  This experience brought many lessons including clarity about her soul's mission to write a Legacy Project of 22 books, including a 4-book Cancer Path series that would help women with breast cancer to view it as a spiritual path.</p>
<p>Dr. Paulette Kouffman Sherman is a psychologist, life coach and the author of 9 books (by March 2013).  She has helped many people with challenges concerning illness, career goals, anxiety, depression and relationship issues during her career.</p>
<p>This campaign is important because getting a diagnosis of breast cancer is scary and the treatment grueling, so women going through this experience need hope, guidance and a powerful context.</p>
<p>Dr. Sherman funded the first 4 books in her Legacy Project herself and now she wants funding partners for this four-book series. Even when being very careful with expenses, each book costs at least $1500 to produce.  In addition, she wants to donate free books to at least 25 cancer libraries so that women going through breast cancer treatment have access to this series for free for years to come.</p>
<p>Thousands of omen can benefit from your generosity and so can you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here are 10 packages and ways you can help so that this Cancer Path series gets published and disseminated.  See the Perks described on the side.</p>
The 4 book Cancer Path series consists of 4 books.  This is how this series came about and what each book coverst:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p>Going through breast cancer was one of the hardest years of my life.  I wouldn't wish it on anyone, yet I have found that a lot of growth came from it. I love to write, so I wrote about my experience and came through it with a book that was more than 300 pages.  It was part memoir, part self-help, as well as a photographic account of how I got through everything, including losng my hair.  Writing was my lifeline and I hoped that in sharing this, it would help other women walk this path.</p>
<p>I thought it unlikely that women struggling with cancer would want to read such a lengthy book, so one day while I was walking the beach I had a revelation that it was meant to be a 4-volume series called <em>The Cancer Path</em>, which could embrace women at different points along their journey. This is the 4 book series:</p>
<p> <strong>Volume 1</strong>- <em>The Quick Essential Guide to Breast Cancer: Diagnosis, Surgery, Chemo &amp; Radiation is</em> a slim guide that you could slip into your purse and flip through for easy tips and references about how to get through your 8 months of standard treatment.  Even if you don’t have cancer, this could be that first cancer gift book that could connect you to someone else who had this experience.  And if you are facing your own cancer diagnosis, this book provides an overview and some practical tips about how to get through surgery, chemo, or radiation.  Some women might prefer just to read these tips, get through conventional treatment, put cancer behind them, and stop there.</p>
<p><strong>Volume 2</strong>- <em>The Cancer Path: A Spiritual Journey Through Healing, Wholeness &amp; Love </em>approaches cancer on a level deeper, as a spiritual initiation.  It allows you to heal cancer from the inside-out by giving you tools to address healing your mind, body, emotions, and Spirit as you go through your traditional treatment.  If you are like me, you may not want to be a passive recipient of healing.  You may want to take action and create a year of treatment that leads to greater wholeness and health on all levels.  I read over 60 books so that I could address these four levels of healing for you, with many sub-headings, as well as to explore many discrepant issues like diet, how your immune system affects cancer, whether your emotions, thoughts and stress affect cancer, and so forth.  This book is for the cancer patient who wants to do serious inner work and learn spiritual lessons along this path.</p>
<p><strong>Volume 3</strong>- <em>My Date With Cancer: 21 Spiritual Lessons </em>is a gift book that explores 21 spiritual lessons from Volume 2, without the more intensive research, explanation, and exercises.  It has pictures and brief spiritual lessons that a cancer patient can flip through while in the hospital.  It's intended to provide love and hope, and to point out some spiritual lessons that can help patients grow and be positive while on their cancer path.</p>
<p><strong>Volume 4</strong> - <em>Create Your Own Cancer Path Workbook </em>is a workbook to help cancer patients keep track of their personal experience and story.  It is a journal/workbook with ideas, springboards and exercises so that they can remember and record how they got through chemotherapy, what and who inspired them, the lessons they learned, and other memorable moments.  In the end, they can use this workbook as a template for writing and publishing their own story, if they wish.  Its can be a journal, a place to vent and cope, and a legacy for their children, grandchildren, and great-grand children to learn from their story.  Research shows that there are many benefits to cancer patients from journaling and leaving a legacy behind.</p>
<p>Don't forget to tell people about your perks and get them excited!</p>
<p>All funds collected will go towards completing this 4 book Cancer Path series even if we don’t reach the entire 22 book goal here.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><em>The Cancer Path</em>  examines healing on all four levels, examining controversial questions related to cancer treatment, addressing coping strategies, healing resources and providing many practical tips along the way.  Dr. Sherman references over sixty books as milestones along The Cancer Path but realizes that each woman's journey is unique.  She knows that these books will help many survivors.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Cancer Path</em> will help them:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feel less alone on this startling &amp; challenging journey</strong></li>
<li><strong>Develop a Healing Team that supports you </strong></li>
<li><strong>Explore ways to process your emotions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Find Spiritual meaning in your illness</strong></li>
<li><strong>Choose positive thoughts and a powerful context about your cancer </strong></li>
<li><strong>Explore the research on controversial issues related to your cancer treatment</strong></li>
<li><strong>Examine diet, movement and alternative therapies for your body</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consider the role of meditation and prayer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reflect upon the spiritual lessons you receive on your cancer path</strong></li>
<li><strong>Marry healing on all four levels for optimal holistic growth</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>...And so much more!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dr. Sherman felt that her cancer path brought her spiritual purpose into focus and she wants the same for others going through this!</p>

Even when being very careful with expenses, each book costs at least $1500 to produce.  In addition, she wants to donate free books to at least 25 cancer libraries so that women going through breast cancer treatment have access to this series for free for years to come.
Thousands of omen can benefit from your generosity and so can you.


What We Need & What You Get
Here are 10 packages and ways you can help so that this Cancer Path series gets published and disseminated.  See the Perks described on the side.
The 4 book Cancer Path series consists of 4 books.  This is how this series came about and what each book coverst:
 

Going through breast cancer was one of the hardest years of my life.  I wouldn't wish it on anyone, yet I have found that a lot of growth came from it. I love to write, so I wrote about my experience and came through it with a book that was more than 300 pages.  It was part memoir, part self-help, as well as a photographic account of how I got through everything, including losng my hair.  Writing was my lifeline and I hoped that in sharing this, it would help other women walk this path.
I thought it unlikely that women struggling with cancer would want to read such a lengthy book, so one day while I was walking the beach I had a revelation that it was meant to be a 4-volume series called The Cancer Path, which could embrace women at different points along their journey. This is the 4 book series:
 Volume 1- The Quick Essential Guide to Breast Cancer: Diagnosis, Surgery, Chemo & Radiation is a slim guide that you could slip into your purse and flip through for easy tips and references about how to get through your 8 months of standard treatment.  Even if you don’t have cancer, this could be that first cancer gift book that could connect you to someone else who had this experience.  And if you are facing your own cancer diagnosis, this book provides an overview and some practical tips about how to get through surgery, chemo, or radiation.  Some women might prefer just to read these tips, get through conventional treatment, put cancer behind them, and stop there.
Volume 2- The Cancer Path: A Spiritual Journey Through Healing, Wholeness & Love approaches cancer on a level deeper, as a spiritual initiation.  It allows you to heal cancer from the inside-out by giving you tools to address healing your mind, body, emotions, and Spirit as you go through your traditional treatment.  If you are like me, you may not want to be a passive recipient of healing.  You may want to take action and create a year of treatment that leads to greater wholeness and health on all levels.  I read over 60 books so that I could address these four levels of healing for you, with many sub-headings, as well as to explore many discrepant issues like diet, how your immune system affects cancer, whether your emotions, thoughts and stress affect cancer, and so forth.  This book is for the cancer patient who wants to do serious inner work and learn spiritual lessons along this path.
Volume 3- My Date With Cancer: 21 Spiritual Lessons is a gift book that explores 21 spiritual lessons from Volume 2, without the more intensive research, explanation, and exercises.  It has pictures and brief spiritual lessons that a cancer patient can flip through while in the hospital.  It's intended to provide love and hope, and to point out some spiritual lessons that can help patients grow and be positive while on their cancer path.
Volume 4 - Create Your Own Cancer Path Workbook is a workbook to help cancer patients keep track of their personal experience and story.  It is a journal/workbook with ideas, springboards and exercises so that they can remember and record how they got through chemotherapy, what and who inspired them, the lessons they learned, and other memorable moments.  In the end, they can use this workbook as a template for writing and publishing their own story, if they wish.  Its can be a journal, a place to vent and cope, and a legacy for their children, grandchildren, and great-grand children to learn from their story.  Research shows that there are many benefits to cancer patients from journaling and leaving a legacy behind.
Don't forget to tell people about your perks and get them excited!
All funds collected will go towards completing this 4 book Cancer Path series even if we don’t reach the entire 22 book goal here.


The Impact
The Cancer Path  examines healing on all four levels, examining controversial questions related to cancer treatment, addressing coping strategies, healing resources and providing many practical tips along the way.  Dr. Sherman references over sixty books as milestones along The Cancer Path but realizes that each woman's journey is unique.  She knows that these books will help many survivors.
The Cancer Path will help them:

Feel less alone on this startling & challenging journey
Develop a Healing Team that supports you 
Explore ways to process your emotions
Find Spiritual meaning in your illness
Choose positive thoughts and a powerful context about your cancer 
Explore the research on controversial issues related to your cancer treatment
Examine diet, movement and alternative therapies for your body
Consider the role of meditation and prayer
Reflect upon the spiritual lessons you receive on your cancer path
Marry healing on all four levels for optimal holistic growth

...And so much more!
 
Dr. Sherman felt that her cancer path brought her spiritual purpose into focus and she wants the same for others going through this!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><img alt=""The Grave Blogger"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://thegraveblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gbtwitter.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""The Grave Blogger""/>Hi. My name is Donna Fontenot and I've been a blogger since 2004, back in the early days when blogging was just starting to become known. I've also been a prominent member of the online marketing world for even longer, as well as a web developer. In short, blogging and everything involved with having a presence online has been my forte for many years. And yet, none of that would have been possible without my interest and abilities as a writer. Without the ability to  create great content, success online would have been short-lived.</p>
<p>I've finally decided to bring this all together into a novel that incorporates my experiences as a blogger with that of my fascination with the deviant criminal mind. Just for fun and interest, I've also rolled my heritage into the novel as well. I'm a little Cajun gal from the Louisiana bayous, and frankly, there's no better setting I can imagine for a good mystery / suspense / thriller novel.</p>
<p>I believe the story of The Grave Blogger is one that will intrigue readers and capture their attention. The book is nearly finished and it will be time to publish it soon. I know I am a good writer, but I also know that even the greatest writers need help to create a commercially successful book. That's where you come in. With your generous help, I can turn a great book into one that gets the attention it will need to succeed.  You can see the book's website and video trailer at <a href=""http://thegraveblogger.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""The Grave Blogger"">TheGraveBlogger.com</a> .</p>
<p>Even small contributions are welcome and will earn my sincere gratitude. One thing you can count on - I will remember you, and that may come in handy some day - you never know!</p>
<h3><strong>What I Need</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I need funds to hire a good editor, primarily. Even if I don't meet the complete funding goal here to accomplish all that I need, hiring a good editor is an absolute must, so any partial funding I receive will be applied to that need first. All other funding will cover getting a professional book cover and book interior designed, purchasing a block of ISBN numbers, ordering enough books to give out as review copies, and running promotional campaigns, which will include press releases and social networking promotions.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Besides my undying gratitude, you get the sorts of goodies I've listed in the perks to the right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every contribution gets a mention either in the book itself or on my blog.</li>
<li>Of course, many contributors will receive a free copy of the book either in digital or paper form.</li>
<li>Some of you can even get a character in the book created with your name! Really, how cool is that? :)</li>
<li>There's even a level which entitles the most generous of contributors to enjoy a stay at one of Louisiana's most intriguing places, including a bayou tour that will put you right into the setting of the novel!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I don't promise that my novel will change the world. It won't. It won't feed starving children, or bring peace on Earth. But it will make a huge difference in my life, because I will have accomplished my lifelong dream. As we grow older, we begin to look back on the things we wished we'd done. We all end up with a bucket list at some point in our lives. My bucket list is rather small, as I'm content with the choices I've made. But one item has been rattling around in that bucket for a lifetime. I not only want to write a novel, I want to write a novel that readers love. I believe I can do that with your help. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand if you can't contribute right now. Times are hard. I really will appreciate even small amounts, but if that is more than you can or want to give right now, there are other ways you can help me. I would very much appreciate your help in spreading the word about this campaign of mine. It's easy to do. Just tell people about it. Near the top of this page are some social network buttons.

The post was based on two of my own successful fundraising campaigns: <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/Zero-Tuition-College?a=140053"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zero Tuition College ($2370)</a> and <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/btc?a=140053"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Better Than College ($9200)</a>.</p>
<p class=""p2"">The response to my post was overwhelming! Young people started writing and asking me for campaign-building advice—specifically for their travel goals—which I took on as a fun challenge. Soon, they were asking for more guidance than I could provide. What resulted were multiple successful travel fundraising campaigns, including:</p>

Don't miss my article on the Matador Network: How to crowdfund your next travel adventure.
Travel can change your life. But travel can be expensive. 
So what's the answer for the young, broke, and travel-hungry?
The Unschool Adventures Guide to Online Travel Fundraising is an e-book that will explain how to creatively raise money for a life-changing travel experience. Whether you want to backpack across Europe for two months, take a full-blown gap year, or simply attend summer camp on the other side of the country, this book will help you get there.

Who I Am & Why You Should Fund This Book
I’m Blake Boles, the author of two books about giving yourself an adventurous, nontraditional education: College Without High School and Better Than College.
I’m also the founder and director of the travel company Unschool Adventures, through which I lead international trips, writing retreats, and other programs for self-directed teens.
A huge number of young adults (and their parents) have asked me how they can afford a big international trip. In response, this May I wrote a blog post about raising money for travels, projects, and education using the crowdfunding websites Kickstarter and IndieGoGo.

<h3>Landscape magazine must stay</h3>
<p>Are you one of the thousands of readers who've enjoyed Landscape Magazine for the last years? Then please help us continue making it! The current 'owners' sadly have no time left to make this awesome magazine for us anymore. But we don't want it to stop existing! Landscape is a free magazine made with passion for you bikers out there. So we went and have a talk with them and worked things out. We will continue the magazine for them!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Of course over the years there has been a lot of money invested in Landscape (website, iPad App, events, etc. etc.) and they want something in return: some cash! We believe they've earned it and Landscape Magazine should not be bought by a big publisher who will only use the contacts for their own magazines and let Landscape Magazine die. So help us raise the cash to continue Landscape Magazine the way it was and the way it should be in the future! And as a thank you we will send the first new issue to your door, together with some awesome stickers!</p>
