Hello! We're a group of high school students developing a nonprofit organization based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

When tasked with starting our own business, we saw two problems that we, as a team, wanted to solve. First off, individuals with developmental disabilities often times find their employment options disappear after they finish their high school or college education. On the other side, entrepreneurs who begin startup business often times have lots of tasks which can be given to others such as data entry, packaging, mailing, and simple product assembly. In order to help solve both these issues, we decided to create a platform that connects startups to these developmentally disabled individuals in an internship style program that will hopefully lead to permanent employment for the participant and more time for the entrepreneur to focus on the long-term goals for their business.




   What We Need & What You Get We need $1000 to be able to sponsor our first four participants. We already have contacted startups to commit to our pilot program but if we are unable to provide stipends for the participants, we won't be able to make an impact. The perks we offer really allow you, as a donor, to see exactly what kind of an impact you're making. Listed below is a diagram of how are funds are distributed.





  The Impact We all know someone with a developmental disability so this is a cause that touches every single person. Our program's impact is immense. Together we can truly transform lives for the better. With just a simple donation, you could be helping an individual with a developmental disability attain permanent employment and valuable skills moving forward. As this spreads and becomes a nationwide business, we can change hundreds of thousands of lives and all it takes is one small donation. 

  Risks & Challenges The main challenge that we, as a group face, is a lack of business experience. Being high school students we are constantly working to reach higher goals and as we move forward, we'd need to contract outside help to continue our venture. Our future goal is to have our program added into a greater organization such as Autism Speaks so that we can reach a wider audience and make a greater impact on a greater scale.

  Other Ways You Can Help As always, we'd appreciate it if you could just share the word with your friends, family, and coworkers to help us raise the funds we need.

That was my car, and I wasn't even driving it, and without it I can't get a job at all, and she certainly can't get to her job, either. There is literally no other form of transportation in our area, like cab or bus service. We don't have any access to those.

It's due to be turned off this week, and originally my mother would've had the money to pay for it sooner. But with having to pay bail and everything instead, she hardly has any money left. We're trying to get help with this from the places in our area that help families in need like us, but it's hard when they have specific hours when you can call and we may not have enough time to get that help, either.</div><div>
<h3>What You Can Do</h3>It would be so incredibly helpful if, somehow, you could donate something to us to help us get closer to solving these problems. We may be able to sort out power on our own, but there's no guarantee, and the payment for the car is much more difficult because when a car is impounded, they add a charge for every day that it's still with them, so the cost keeps rising. Anything you could give would do a world of good for us! Even if we can't reach the goal, whatever you send will go entirely toward the bills that we're behind on.</div><div><br/></div><div>If you can't donate, that's okay! You can share this with as many people as possible and spread the word so that we can get past this awful time and move forward with our lives.</div></div>","What's HappeningFrankly, I absolutely hate having to ask for help from people who don't know me, but we're desperate.

<strong>Our Stor</strong>y</h2>
<p>Ooples Anime Center has been in business for almost two years and we are looking to expand the store to include a dedicated cafe, manga reading room, LAN center and arcade.</p>

<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>There are not many places in San Antonio which offer an authentic arcade experience with import Japanese and classic games. We also wish to construct a more suitable environment to host our cosplay café, with nice tables and chairs for guests to sit in.

Ooples Anime Center has been in business for almost two years and we are looking to expand the store to include a dedicated cafe, manga reading room, LAN center and arcade.
 
The Impact
There are not many places in San Antonio which offer an authentic arcade experience with import Japanese and classic games. We also wish to construct a more suitable environment to host our cosplay café, with nice tables and chairs for guests to sit in. We also intend to install a kitchen so that food can be prepared fresh onsite and made to order. We want the cosplay cafe to become a permanent part of the store and open every day of the week!
We would also like to offer a quiet library room for those renting manga to read them in. Not to mention we will be opening the first geek themed bar in San Antonio!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are the Zulu Orphan Alliance (<a href=""http://www.zuluorphans.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.zuluorphans.org</a>), an ALL VOLUNTEER American Nonprofit organization.  We work in South Africa with children orphaned by HIV/AIDS and other children who are in danger of being orphaned.  By 2015, it is estimated that 1/3rd of South African Zulu children will be orphaned.  We currently help house 25-30 children at Bhekanisizwe, a small children's home in Adams Mission, South Africa.  We also feed and additional 23-30 children twice daily who otherwise would not eat. Long term plans include building a larger compound that will have dormitories, a modern kitchen, composting toilets, solar energy, and a community building that will be used by local Zulu women for an income generating beading cooperative--but all of that will be very expensive--about $80,000 US.  So we are starting with a smaller project that will have a huge impact on our ability to feed everyone.</p>
<p>Our primary goal now is to build a greenhouse and a chicken coop/goat pen to ensure that our kids have access to healthy, abundant food on a consistent basis.  Food security is very important to children who have known constant hunger for the majority of their lives.</p>
<p>We need $4750.00 to purchase building materials, organic seeds, chickens, goats, and other supplies, as well as money to hire local Zulu workers to actually build the buildings.  This will help the local economy, where unemployment is over 60%.</p>
<p>By helping us, you will not only receive good Karma for keeping children safe and alive, but we have some pretty cool gifts for you as well!</p>
<p>For donations of $25, you will receive a hand-written thank you note and a picture and short bio of one of the children you are helping.</p>
<p>For donations of $50, you will receive the above, plus a piece of original art drawn by a Zulu child living at our facility in South Africa.</p>
<p>For donations of $100, you will receive the above plus a Zulu Orphan Alliance T-shirt.</p>
<p>For donations of $500 or more, we will give you all of the above, plus WE WILL NAME A GOAT AFTER YOU!</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, you can be assured that the entire amount we do raise will go directly to feeding the children.  Since we are an all volunteer organization, no money goes to salaries, offices, or anything not directly related to helping these kids.</li>
</ul><p>The Impact</p>
<p>How often can you say that you actually made a difference in a child's life?  By helping us you are literally saving lives.  People ask us all the time why we work with kids in a foreign land when there is so much need here in the US--we tell them we work in South Africa because, unlike here in America, there are no social safety nets--no welfare, food stamps, or homeless shelters.  Without intervention, these children very likely might die.  We just can't let that happen.  And with your help, we won't.</p>
<div>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you can't help us financially, please help us by spreading the word.  Use Facebook, Twitter, word-of-mouth--to help us expose folks to what we do and who we are helping.  Please share our website: <a href=""http://www.zuluorphans.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.zuluorphans.org</a>.</p>

<h3>Niekoľko slov o mne ...</h3>
<p>Volám sa Anton Gajdoš a mám rád svoju prácu. Dlho som hľadal možnosti nízkonákladového bývania, no konvenčné spôsoby výstavby to nedovoľujú .Preto som začal  hľadať alternatívne a najmä lacnejšie spôsoby výstavby domu...a nakoniec som našiel riešenie ""dom zo slamy"".  Prírodnému staviteľstvu som sa začal venovať v roku 2009 navštívil som množstvo workshopov a seminárov v Čechách a na Slovenku.  Na základe mojich zručnosti a vedomostí som sa rozhodol tejto činnosti venovať profesionálne. V roku 2010 som spolu s mojou rodinou a známymi postavil svoj prvý slamený dom, ktorý momentálne slúži ako ateliér, ukážkový domček a chalupa na rekreáciu zároveň...;-) Viac informácií o mne a mojej práci nájdete na mojom webe <a href=""http://www.slamene-domy.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.slamene-domy.eu</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Aké sú moje ciele a zámery...</h3>
<p>Prečo to vlastne robím...?Mám rád svoju prácu pri ktorej som v kontakte s tradičnými materiálmi ako sú hlina, slama, drevo, kameň a vytváram  z nich niečo úplne nové v čom sa noví majitelia budú cítiť veľmi príjemne a najmä zdravo. Chcem pomáhať ľudom postaviť si svoj vlastný dom zo zdravých, prírodných a recyklovateľných materiálov, aby si tak splnili svoje predstavy  o svojom vysnívanom domove. Vďaka Vám a Vašej finančnej pomoci budem môcť  začať vyrábať  ekologické slamené panely. Slamené panely spĺňajú najvyššie štandardy kvality a bezpečnosti Európskej únie.  Z týchto prefabrikovaných panelov sú čisto prírodné ekologické domy postavené veľmi rýchlo a ľahko, šetria náklady na výstavbu  a samozrejme šetria prírodné prostredie. Vybrané peniaze použijeme  na rozvoj výroby organických panelov z lisovanej slamy a prenajmeme si nové väčšie skladovacie priestory, ktoré sú už v súčasnej dobe nedostačujúce. Ak sa rozhodnete pre akúkoľvek formu pomoci, nepomáhate iba mne, ale aj iným ľuďom ,ktorí  sú ,alebo budú zapojení do tohto projektu. Pomôžete vytvoriť unikátne miesto, kde prebieha výroba, predaj a distribúcia „čisto ekologických produktov“. Vďaka tomuto projektu vzniknú nové pracovné miesta , pomôžeme aj miestnym roľníkom a nakoniec  pomôžeme aj sami sebe, pretože samotná produkcia CO2 pri slamenej stavbe je o 43% nižšia ako pri komerčných stavbách .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ukážem vám pár obrázkov ako vyzerajú panely zo slamy, aby ste mali predstavu ako sa dá rýchlo, krásne a prírodne bývať:<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.slamene-domy.eu/fotogaleria/#a201108041008-jpg1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.slamene-domy.eu/fotogaleria/ # a201108041008-jpg1</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Kam presne pôjde Vaša finančná pomoc?!</h3>
<p>Vaša finančná podpora pôjde na zdokonalenie  výrobného procesu slamených panelov. Tento proces sa  zjednoduší, výroba sa urýchli a znížia sa náklady na výrobu, tým pádom bude nižšia aj konečná cena. Vytvoríme nový ekologický  výrobok, vďaka ktorému vznikne lacné , ale zdravé a vkusné bývanie.</p>

</div></div>","Čisto prírodné stavebné panely zo slamy.
Rodinný, ekologický a pasívny dom, ktorý je 100% recyklovateľný, lacný a postavíte ho za 2 dni vďaka našej revolučnej technológii stavebných panelov zo slamy.
The English version is below 
 
Niekoľko slov o mne ...
Volám sa Anton Gajdoš a mám rád svoju prácu. Dlho som hľadal možnosti nízkonákladového bývania, no konvenčné spôsoby výstavby to nedovoľujú .Preto som začal  hľadať alternatívne a najmä lacnejšie spôsoby výstavby domu...a nakoniec som našiel riešenie ""dom zo slamy"".  Prírodnému staviteľstvu som sa začal venovať v roku 2009 navštívil som množstvo workshopov a seminárov v Čechách a na Slovenku.  Na základe mojich zručnosti a vedomostí som sa rozhodol tejto činnosti venovať profesionálne. V roku 2010 som spolu s mojou rodinou a známymi postavil svoj prvý slamený dom, ktorý momentálne slúži ako ateliér, ukážkový domček a chalupa na rekreáciu zároveň...;-) Viac informácií o mne a mojej práci nájdete na mojom webe www.slamene-domy.eu.
 
Aké sú moje ciele a zámery...
Prečo to vlastne robím...?Mám rád svoju prácu pri ktorej som v kontakte s tradičnými materiálmi ako sú hlina, slama, drevo, kameň a vytváram  z nich niečo úplne nové v čom sa noví majitelia budú cítiť veľmi príjemne a najmä zdravo. Chcem pomáhať ľudom postaviť si svoj vlastný dom zo zdravých, prírodných a recyklovateľných materiálov, aby si tak splnili svoje predstavy  o svojom vysnívanom domove. Vďaka Vám a Vašej finančnej pomoci budem môcť  začať vyrábať  ekologické slamené panely. Slamené panely spĺňajú najvyššie štandardy kvality a bezpečnosti Európskej únie.  Z týchto prefabrikovaných panelov sú čisto prírodné ekologické domy postavené veľmi rýchlo a ľahko, šetria náklady na výstavbu  a samozrejme šetria prírodné prostredie. Vybrané peniaze použijeme  na rozvoj výroby organických panelov z lisovanej slamy a prenajmeme si nové väčšie skladovacie priestory, ktoré sú už v súčasnej dobe nedostačujúce. Ak sa rozhodnete pre akúkoľvek formu pomoci, nepomáhate iba mne, ale aj iným ľuďom ,ktorí  sú ,alebo budú zapojení do tohto projektu. Pomôžete vytvoriť unikátne miesto, kde prebieha výroba, predaj a distribúcia „čisto ekologických produktov“. Vďaka tomuto projektu vzniknú nové pracovné miesta , pomôžeme aj miestnym roľníkom a nakoniec  pomôžeme aj sami sebe, pretože samotná produkcia CO2 pri slamenej stavbe je o 43% nižšia ako pri komerčných stavbách .
 
Ukážem vám pár obrázkov ako vyzerajú panely zo slamy, aby ste mali predstavu ako sa dá rýchlo, krásne a prírodne bývať:http://www.slamene-domy.eu/fotogaleria/ # a201108041008-jpg1
 
Kam presne pôjde Vaša finančná pomoc?!
Vaša finančná podpora pôjde na zdokonalenie  výrobného procesu slamených panelov. Tento proces sa  zjednoduší, výroba sa urýchli a znížia sa náklady na výrobu, tým pádom bude nižšia aj konečná cena. Vytvoríme nový ekologický  výrobok, vďaka ktorému vznikne lacné , ale zdravé a vkusné bývanie.
 

Investícia do výrobných procesov - 4.000,- Dolárov
Prenájom nových, väčších úložných priestorov na slamené balíky a výrobené slamené panely min.na tri mesiace v okolí mesta Trebišov - 3.500, - Dolárov
Nákup materiálov pre výrobu prefabrikátov (slamené baly, drevo, skrutky ...) - 3.250, - Dolars
Reklama na našej ponuky na Slovensku i v zahraničí - 1.500, - dolárov
Výplata zamestnancov po dobu troch mesiacov - 3.500, - dolárov

Poplatky za elektrinu, teplo a palivo po dobu troch mesiacov 1,000,-dolárovVýsledný súčet 16.750, - dolárov

 
Výhody a vlastnosti slamených panelov
 
Zdravotná nezávadnosť:Slamené panely nemajú negatívny vplyv na životné prostredie a ľudské zdravie. K ich výrobe sú použité čisto prírodné materiály - presné drevené rámy a lisovaná slama, ktorá je tu použitá ako tepelne izolačný materiál
Konštrukcia:Technológia ukladania slamy v paneli je úplne unikátna. Slamené steblá sa pri lisovaní do panela ukladajú vo všesmernej orientácii pri zachovaní hustoty 100 kg/m3. Týmto dosahuje slama hodnoty súčiniteľa tepelnej vodivosti = 0,057 W (m2K). Panely majú drevenú rámovú konštrukciu. Ide o nosné konštrukčné prvky, ktoré zodpovedajú požiadavkám na únosnosť, tuhosť a trvanlivosť. Z týchto panelov je možné postaviť prízemné aj poschodové stavby.
Rýchlosť montáže:K hlavným výhodám tohto systému patrí rýchlosť montáže. Múry o ploche 100 m2 je možné v štyroch ľuďoch postaviť za 1-2 dni. Na spájanie panelov nie je potrebné žiadne špeciálne nástroje, používajú sa len ručne skrutkované skrutky.
Vysoká miera izolácie:Systém panelov vylučuje tepelné mosty. Svojimi tepelnoizolačnými vlastnosťami a vysokou vzduchotesnosťou spĺňa štandardy pre pasívne domy.
Skladba steny:Zo strany exteriéru sú slamené panely pokryté drevovláknitou doskou hr. 60 mm. Toto opatrenie zvyšuje tepelnú odolnosť steny, a pôsobí tu ako záveterná, no difúzne otvorená vrstva. Finálna úprava môže byť vykonaná tenkostenou omietkou alebo ako prevetrávaná fasáda s obkladom.Z interiéru je na slamený panel aplikovaná trojvrstvová hlinená omietka alebo sa dajú použiť iné prírodné materiály: dosky na báze dreva, Ekopanely apod Trieda reakcie na oheň je u takto opláštených panelov B-s1, d0.
Filozofia zdravého domuS panelmi získavate zdravý dom s vynikajúcimi vlastnosťami vnútorného prostredia. Prirodzené vlastnosti prírodných materiálov vám poskytnú stabilnú klímu interiéru: ""teplo v zime, chladno v lete"". Ušetríte náklady za inštaláciu chladenia a výkonných vykurovacích systémov, navyše prispejete k ochrane životného prostredia a podpore ekologických aktivít.
Filozofia návrhov a projektovanie domovVďaka universalite systému nie sú domy ponúkané katalógovo, ale podľa individuálnych projektov pre konkrétnych klientov a na konkrétne stavebné parcely a ich lokalitu. Vlastný návrh a spracovanie projektu prebieha až v prípade nadviazania spolupráce. Až veľkosť, štýl, štandard prevedenia a individuálne dopracovanie určí cenu Vášho domu. Presvedčili sme sa, že kvalitné premyslený projekt dokáže ušetriť najviac peňazí a jeho používatelia sú oveľa spokojnejší.
Skúsenosti s podobným projektom.
Tento projekt je unikátny svojím rozsahom a jedinečnosťou na Slovensku a možno aj na svete čiže je to pre mňa niečo úplne nové. Budem rád ak sa cieľ vyzbierať 16.750,- dolárov naplní už len kvôli výrobku,ktorý z tejto Vašej pomoci vznikne. Mal som individuálne projekty, ktoré zlepšujú bývanie sociálne slabým a mladým rodinám na Slovenskú na ktorých spolupráca ešte trvá.
 
Iné spôsoby, ako môžete pomôcť
 Prispejte prosím na tento projekt či už finančne,alebo to doslava vykričte do sveta, že sa niečo také na Slovensku deje. Čím viac ľudí o tom hovorí tým je to lepšie pre celý svet...

A few words about me ...
For a long time I was looking into a low-cost housing, but conventional methods of construction to allow it. Accordingly, I started looking for alternative and cheaper methods of construction ... and I finally found a solution to the ""house of straw"". Natural engineering I started in 2009 I visited a variety of workshops and seminars in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Based on my skills and knowledge I have decided to dedicate this work professionally. In 2010, I along with my family and friends built his first straw house, which now serves as a studio sample house and cottage for recreation while ... ;-) more information about me and my work, you can find on my web www.slamene-domy.eu
For what purpose will use your financial contributions ...
I had a dream .. that will change the world for the better ... That's why I started environmental engineering and natural materials. Helping socially weaker people and young families with children to fulfill their dream of a healthy and beautiful home. Thanks to you and your financial aid I create organic production in straw panels. At this point we're assembled straw panels, which meet the highest quality and safety standards of the European Union. From such prefabricated panels are pure natural green houses are built very quickly and easily, saving the cost of construction of houses and of course the natural environment. Collected money will use to develop the production of organic panels of pressed straw and storage spaces that are already currently insufficient. I'll show you a few images to give you an idea how these look straw panels and how quickly they build beautiful natural homes:http://www.slamene-domy.eu/fotogaleria/#a201108041008-jpg1If I can help and contribute, just not helping me! Help people, which I can thanks to your financial support to employ (in our region is 19.30% unemployment)! Help socially weak people for whom these straw panels are made, and so they live in a healthy and eco-house, which can be easily recycled. And help each other, because through ecological construction reduces CO2 in the air by 43%.
 
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me on the email agajdos@centrum.sk
 
Your financial contributions will go exactly...
I need your financial support so that the manufacturing process of straw panels could simplify, speed up and reduce the cost of production hence the final price. Then provide greater assistance to the socially weaker families and young families with children in the construction of cheap, but healthy and tasteful living.

Start-up and expansion of manufacturing straw panels - 4.000,-Dollars 
Renting a new, bigger storage space for three months around Trebisov in Eastern Slovakia - 3.500,- Dollars
Purchase of materials for the production of prefabricated panels (straw bales, wood, screws ...) - 3.250,- Dolars
Advertising on our offer visibility in Slovakia and abroad - 1.500,- Dollars
Payment to two employees for three months for three months 3.500,- Dollars
Charges for electricity, heat and fuel for three months 1.000,-Dollars
The resulting sum 16.750,- Dollars
 
Benefits of building with straw panels:
Health safety:Straw panels have no negative impact on the environment and human health. Their uses only pure natural materials - wood frames and precision molded straw, which is used as a thermal insulation material
construction:Storage Technology straw panel is completely unique. Straw straws when pressing the panel stored in directional orientation while maintaining the density of 100 kg/m3. This straw reaches thermal conductivity = 0.057 W (m 2 K). The panels are wood frame construction. It is a structural design features that meet the requirements for strength, rigidity and durability. From these panels can be built and ground-story building.
Speed of assembly:The main advantages of this system include speed assembly. Wall with an area of 100 m2 in four people can stand up for 1-2 days. For connecting panels is not no need for special tools, are used only manually screwed screws.
High level of insulation:Panel system eliminates thermal bridges. Its thermal insulation properties and high.
Wall Construction:From the exterior side panels are covered with straw fibreboard plate thickness. 60 mm. This measure increases the thermal resistance of the wall, and there are as leeward, but diffusion layer. The final adjustment can be made tenkostěnou plaster or ventilated facade cladding.The interior is on straw panel applied three layers of clay or plaster can use other natural materials: wood-based panels, etc. Ekopanely Reaction to fire with such a sheathed panels B-s1, d0.

To be collected the entire amount ...?!
The collected money to invest in new material for the production of straw panels and particularly in accelerating the production of panels straw ... and remained in the old and small areas where we have worked well so far even though it will not be so effective ...
Your contribution helps globally, but also locally ...

contribute to reducing air emissions worldwide
Your contribution will help people who need housing quickly and cheaply
help develop the region thanks to new job opportunities, because we have all the materials from local sources.
Contribute to the new construction industry: natural architecture, which is friendly to nature and the people of this planet.

 

Philosophy healthy house

The panels get healthy house with outstanding features indoor environment. Natural properties of natural materials will provide a stable interior climate, ""warm in winter, cool in the summer."" Save the cost of installing cooling and powerful heating systems, also help to protect the environment and promote environmental activities.

<h3>WATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE WORK OF HYBRID SOCIAL SOLUTIONS AND STIFTUNG SOLARENERGIE! </h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">THE PROBLEM?</span></h3>
<p><img alt=""Children in a rural community in the Philippines"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i43.tinypic.com/302nva1.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>One in four Filipinos lack access to electricity. Without access, rural Filipinos are forced to turn to unsafe, inefficient, and expensive energy sources for essential needs. <a href=""http://www.hybridsolutions.moonfruit.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hybrid Social Solutions</a> (HSSi) and Stiftung Solarenergie (StS), solar energy companies that serve the rural poor, are in the early stages of incubating the <strong>Philippines' first solar access center</strong> in the rural province of El Nido, Palawan. The center will be a self-sustainable, revenue-generating community space powered by independent off-grid photovoltaic panels. <strong>I have been offered the opportunity to to</strong> l<strong>ead the project development and implementation of the solar center</strong> on behalf of HSSi and StS should I raise funds for my work this summer. </p>
<p>I am passionate about international economic development and entrepreneurship in emerging markets. This summer I want to join this top-notch team to <strong>help alleviate energy poverty in the Philippines!</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>THE OPPORTUNITY?</h3>
<p>The approximate 37,000 residents of the municipality of El Nido are a case study on the issue of electrical indigence in the Philippines. The region consists of 45 small, mountainous islands, and communities are rural and remote. The average household income in El Nido is approximately PhP7,000 (USD $170) per month and a mere 29% are electrified. The majority of the 18 villages in the region are too remote to be reached by a decrepit power plant’s electrical grid. Government plans for full electrification of the region by 2014 seem infeasible. To provide basic light, families use kerosene or battery powered lamps, but kerosene lamps provide inadequate lighting, are fire hazard risks and pose serious threats to health; they cause respiratory infections, poisoning and cancers. Batteries are a safer alternative, but they cost El Nido residents 4,000 times more than the average American spends on electricity per unit. It is not uncommon for a family to spend the majority of its meager income to buy batteries or kerosene. In El Nido, as elsewhere, energy poverty is a huge barrier to development – it impedes the education system, increases susceptibility to disease, and handicaps small business. <strong>This project is an opportunity to have a significant impact on one of these rural communities, and will lay the groundwork for future solar center installations. </strong></p>
<p>This summer experience also offers me a <strong>hands-on educational opportunity</strong> on a subject for which I am passionate. I hope to use the lessons I learn this summer in <strong>future international development work</strong>.</p>
<h3>WHAT WILL I DO?</h3>
<h3><img alt=""A possible lay out for the El Nido Solar Center"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i42.tinypic.com/33djdd5.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>As the <strong>project manager for the launch of the solar center</strong>, my role will entail a varied set of responsibilities. Over the course of 9 weeks, our team will determine: site location, a revenue model that will cover the operating expenses of the center, educational content for learning tablet devices, capacity-building workshops for employees, among other responsibilities. Interviews and surveys conducted in El Nido villages will be critical to determine the site of the solar center. We will leverage information about finances, health, education, quality of life and other factors related to the availability of clean, solar energy, to determine the particular components of the solar center such as internet accessible electronic tablets for educational purposes, water purification pumps, a small store, an industrial refrigerator for ice production and medicine storage, and mobile banking services. The exact combination of such facilities will be determined by our site visits and interviews.</p>
<p class=""normal"">In early August, <strong>this work will culminate in the launch of the first independently sustainable solar access center in the Philippines.</strong> With careful due diligence, backed by the support of noted organizations such as HSSi and StS, our project will have a lasting impact.    </p>
<h3>THE COSTS?</h3>
<p>Below is a breakdown of my costs while in the Philippines:</p>
<p>- 1 roundtrip ticket from Tokyo to Manila: $537.50</p>
<p>- 3 roundtrip tickets from Manila to El Nido: $825</p>
<p>- 9 weeks rent in Manila: $900</p>
<p>- 3 weeks varied lodging in El Nido: $250</p>
<p>- Food: $750</p>

</div></div>","WATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE WORK OF HYBRID SOCIAL SOLUTIONS AND STIFTUNG SOLARENERGIE! 
THE PROBLEM?
One in four Filipinos lack access to electricity. Without access, rural Filipinos are forced to turn to unsafe, inefficient, and expensive energy sources for essential needs. Hybrid Social Solutions (HSSi) and Stiftung Solarenergie (StS), solar energy companies that serve the rural poor, are in the early stages of incubating the Philippines' first solar access center in the rural province of El Nido, Palawan. The center will be a self-sustainable, revenue-generating community space powered by independent off-grid photovoltaic panels. I have been offered the opportunity to to lead the project development and implementation of the solar center on behalf of HSSi and StS should I raise funds for my work this summer. 
I am passionate about international economic development and entrepreneurship in emerging markets. This summer I want to join this top-notch team to help alleviate energy poverty in the Philippines!


THE OPPORTUNITY?
The approximate 37,000 residents of the municipality of El Nido are a case study on the issue of electrical indigence in the Philippines. The region consists of 45 small, mountainous islands, and communities are rural and remote. The average household income in El Nido is approximately PhP7,000 (USD $170) per month and a mere 29% are electrified. The majority of the 18 villages in the region are too remote to be reached by a decrepit power plant’s electrical grid. Government plans for full electrification of the region by 2014 seem infeasible. To provide basic light, families use kerosene or battery powered lamps, but kerosene lamps provide inadequate lighting, are fire hazard risks and pose serious threats to health; they cause respiratory infections, poisoning and cancers. Batteries are a safer alternative, but they cost El Nido residents 4,000 times more than the average American spends on electricity per unit. It is not uncommon for a family to spend the majority of its meager income to buy batteries or kerosene. In El Nido, as elsewhere, energy poverty is a huge barrier to development – it impedes the education system, increases susceptibility to disease, and handicaps small business. This project is an opportunity to have a significant impact on one of these rural communities, and will lay the groundwork for future solar center installations. 
This summer experience also offers me a hands-on educational opportunity on a subject for which I am passionate. I hope to use the lessons I learn this summer in future international development work.
WHAT WILL I DO?

 
As the project manager for the launch of the solar center, my role will entail a varied set of responsibilities. Over the course of 9 weeks, our team will determine: site location, a revenue model that will cover the operating expenses of the center, educational content for learning tablet devices, capacity-building workshops for employees, among other responsibilities. Interviews and surveys conducted in El Nido villages will be critical to determine the site of the solar center. We will leverage information about finances, health, education, quality of life and other factors related to the availability of clean, solar energy, to determine the particular components of the solar center such as internet accessible electronic tablets for educational purposes, water purification pumps, a small store, an industrial refrigerator for ice production and medicine storage, and mobile banking services. The exact combination of such facilities will be determined by our site visits and interviews.
In early August, this work will culminate in the launch of the first independently sustainable solar access center in the Philippines. With careful due diligence, backed by the support of noted organizations such as HSSi and StS, our project will have a lasting impact.    
THE COSTS?
Below is a breakdown of my costs while in the Philippines:
- 1 roundtrip ticket from Tokyo to Manila: $537.50
- 3 roundtrip tickets from Manila to El Nido: $825
- 9 weeks rent in Manila: $900
- 3 weeks varied lodging in El Nido: $250
- Food: $750
- Immunizations (Hepatitus A&B, Typhoid, Japanese Encephalitus, Rabies): $240
- Public transportation to work while in Manila: $95.50
- Philippine mult-entry visa: $60
- Incidentals: $200
Total: $3,858
I need a total of $3,858 to cover my expenses this summer! These funds go towards basic lodging, transportation, food, and incidentals like immunizations. Any additional funds will go directly towards other rural electrification projects that will be detailed on my website.
HOW YOU CAN HELP?

The Inca Rally is a throwback to old exploration days, a rejection of overly safe tours and a search for genuine local experiences. It’s a unique challenge and opportunity to have a positive impact on others. It’s a real adventure; with a purpose.
 
The result is an unsupported and untested charity race across South America’s most challenging terrains; taking racers from Peru to Guyana through Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela in 3 weeks. 
 
These are the countries once fabled to be home to the mythical golden city of El Dorado, believed for centuries to be hidden deep in the South American jungle. Along the way, racers will climb vertiginousAndean peaks, cruise through vast plains, bask in the Caribbean sun and plunge into the Amazonian basin. There is no official route - just parties organised in each capital for the drivers who make it that far. 
 
This is the first and only rally to cross this challenging section of South America, from the Pacific coast to the Caribbean beaches.
 
Do you want to help us make it a success?
 
Our Vision: Helping others by going where very few dare to
The Inca Rally’s vision is simple: we are giving people an opportunity to break away from the safety of their daily routine and taking them to places that few dare to.  We seek to challenge ourselves and play our part in helping others.
 
Fundamentally, we are all about creating memorable experiences for people.
 
The Impact
As a social enterprise, we are highly committed to our charitable causes. Each year drivers vote for one of three chosen charities to receive funds they’ve raised for the rally. 2012 nominees are Incawasi, a Peruvian charity trying to break the cycle of family poverty; EveryChild, working to prevent children from growing up vulnerable and alone; and Survival International, campaigning for tribal people’s rights worldwide.  All three charities operate in countries along our route.
 
Before embarking on their adventure, participants will raise money for the chosen charity and will have the opportunity to visit projects along the way, giving them a unique insight under the skin of each country. At the end of the rally, the surviving vehicles will be donated to doctors, teachers and other key members of the community, to benefit the local population.
 
Creative Projects
We couldn’t possibly embark on a journey like The Inca Rally without documenting it and exploring some of the musical and cultural wonders of each country. For this first year, your help and support will enable us to:
 
Film a series of travel episodes
A number of production companies have been interested in documenting our racers’ amazing journey and highlighting the work done by the charities that we stop at en route.
 
Since this is the race’s first year; we want to focus on the route’s logistics before tackling the coordination of a full production crew. Therefore, we are going for quality, not quantity, this year and grouping a number of local camera men in each country to film mini episodes to show online. 
 
Your support will allow us to get the documentary’s proof of concept together and show what a great documentary we could make.
 
Music Festival in Guyana 
There’s no question about it - Guyanese definitely know how to party! Their unique mix of Afro-Caribbean, Latin and South East Asian cultures make it the perfect melting pot to organise a local musical festival at the end of the race. 
 
This not only will give us the perfect opportunity to highlight the cultural and musical wonders of the country, but it will also benefit the domestic economy by working with local businesses throughout the event.
 
We are already in touch with a number of local musicians and artists that are raring to go and your support will allow us to bring it all together into a banging event!
 
Where did the idea come from?
Not content with accepting that every inch of the world has already been mapped, we wanted to find the few places still untouched by mass tourism. The ones that most GPS struggle to pin point, the countries that the average traveller hasn’t gone to; the few corners still relatively unexplored.
 
We also wanted to enrich our lives by helping others. Tired from the city rate race, where we didn’t have a direct beneficial impact on anybody’s wellbeing; we sought to go back to basics and focus on what matters most - your connection with others. 
 
Along the way, we found that many people shared our same beliefs and desires for ethical, adventurous travel experiences. And that’s how The Inca Rally was born!
 
How does the future look for The Inca Rally?
The future is looking...exciting! This is only the first race of many others to come in the following years. And, as the rally’s popularity continues to grow, we’ll expand both the charity partnerships, documentaries and event organisation.
 
As we become more involved with local initiatives and community projects, we will increase our lobbying efforts to help their campaigns, and will make a number of documentaries to raise their profile and highlight their causes.
 
We will also continue to make our en route events bigger and bolder. One of our immediate goals is to grow the final musical event in Guyana into a full-on eco-friendly festival that can also attract many of the local artists from surrounding countries. 
 
What We Need & What You Get
From its colourful beginnings, The Inca Rally has been funded solely by its founder; who has been sleeping very little and working a number of projects to pay for it all. Although this will continue to be the case in order to ensure the rally goes ahead no matter what; we could really do with your support to cover some of the costs in the long list of things we’ll need to buy along the way. 
 
Costs include hiring camera equipment, camera crew transportation, satellite router to upload content in the most remote areas, car mounted cameras, 101 car parts (to be able to complete the rally and document it all), promotional content…the list goes on.
 
Even if we do not achieve our full funding goal, the race will definitely still take place. However, without your help and support, we may not be able to film it all and organise a big musical event at the end. Thus, reducing the positive impact we could have on local charities and businesses. So your help will allow us to help them!

Kit for Coverage!
An adventure such as The Inca Rally involves a remarkable amount of equipment and logistics. While we are looking for financial sponsors, we could also do with individual sponsors who can either provide or pay for specific required equipment. The list of potential equipment sponsorship opportunities is enormous, ranging from branded clothing and mechanical parts to GPS trackers, walkie-talkies and camera equipment.

<p>My name is Jill Van Gyn. I’m a graduate student, a first
aid instructor and a medic. As part of my graduate program I am heading to Gulu
in northern Uganda to conduct research into community engagement in the oil
sector. The primary purpose of this funding initiative is to acquire vital
medical supplies to bring with me to local clinics. The majority will go to St.
Jude’s Health Centre, a non-profit society serving the overall health of the entire community. Included in these costs will be expenses for <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">shipping, baggage fees
and taxes. The clinic is in dire need of the supplies I have l</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">isted below,
which you can purchase as a way to contribute.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/467559/files/20140328150151-Gulu-2_copy.jpg?1396044111"" src="""" style=""width: 249px; height: 249px;""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><a href=""http://stjudechildrenshome.com/departments/health-centre/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://stjudechildrenshome.com/departments/health-centre/</a><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>My Contribution: </b></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I plan on engaging in this community beyond my own research. I am a </span>licensed<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> emergency medical responder and will be volunteering as a medic in Gulu and the surrounding areas. Further, I plan to adapt a volunteer program I run here in Victoria. This program aims to teach high-risk individuals basic life saving skills so that first aid can be carried out on a peer-to-peer basis until medical attention can be made available. This area of Uganda has very limited emergency response and as such creating a stop-gap in the case of injury could prove vital to enhancing the security of the community. Finally, the delivery of the </span>vital medical<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> supplies, which is the focus of this funding, will help to enhance emergency medical care.</span></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">My Research:</b></p>
<p>The Acholi people of this region are recovering from a
15-year conflict with Joseph Kony’s Lords Resistance Army. Many of these people
are Internally Displaced Persons, have lost family members to the brutal raids
carried out by the LRA and are fighting to return home to live out their lives
in peace. Uganda’s emerging oil sector has displaced many of the people
returning home and left them without their traditional livelihoods. Engaging
the community in ethical inclusion in the oil sector and mitigating land rights
and potential conflict will be an important issue in guaranteeing the rights
and security of this valued community.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/467560/files/20140328150220-gulu-3_copy.jpg?1396044140"" src="""" style=""width: 398px; height: 398px;""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Here's the deal- funding allotment will be two-fold:</p><p>I am able to purchase all of the listed medical supplies through my employer, Alert First Aid. I will be getting it at cost. However, I will be asking you to purchase them at the retail price. The remaining balance after cost plus shipping, baggage fees and taxes will go towards my research. The very people who will benefit from the medical supplies will also benefit from my research. These surplus funds will go towards hiring translators, guides, and research assistants all of whom will be drawn from the same community.  Anything beyond this will go to other costs such as permits, transportation and research supplies. In this manner I can carry out my research while immediately contributing to the community in a meaningful and tangible way. I will also be volunteering my services as a medic at local emergency hospitals and hope to teach a community-based first aid course once I am on the ground and established.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Uganda as a whole is considered a relatively stable African country. However, the northern region is largely cut off from the south and is in a geographically precarious area, bordering South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Service delivery, medical among them, is very unreliable and the transport of supplies to this region lacking. Further, the region is slowly recovering from 15 years of prolonged conflict with the LRA. The Acholi were routinely targeted for murder and mutilation, with many of their children kidnapped and turned into child soldiers and sex slaves. The Acholi were moved into IDP camps that at one point exceeded 1.8 million and were known to have some of the world's highest rates of mortality. Today, the north is trying to achieve stability. However, with high rates of unemployment, devastated traditional livelihoods, and land rights hanging in the balance, many are living in the deepest of poverty.

My name is Jill Van Gyn. I’m a graduate student, a first
aid instructor and a medic. As part of my graduate program I am heading to Gulu
in northern Uganda to conduct research into community engagement in the oil
sector. The primary purpose of this funding initiative is to acquire vital
medical supplies to bring with me to local clinics. The majority will go to St.
Jude’s Health Centre, a non-profit society serving the overall health of the entire community. Included in these costs will be expenses for shipping, baggage fees
and taxes. The clinic is in dire need of the supplies I have listed below,
which you can purchase as a way to contribute.http://stjudechildrenshome.com/departments/health-centre/My Contribution: I plan on engaging in this community beyond my own research. I am a licensed emergency medical responder and will be volunteering as a medic in Gulu and the surrounding areas. Further, I plan to adapt a volunteer program I run here in Victoria. This program aims to teach high-risk individuals basic life saving skills so that first aid can be carried out on a peer-to-peer basis until medical attention can be made available. This area of Uganda has very limited emergency response and as such creating a stop-gap in the case of injury could prove vital to enhancing the security of the community. Finally, the delivery of the vital medical supplies, which is the focus of this funding, will help to enhance emergency medical care.My Research:
The Acholi people of this region are recovering from a
15-year conflict with Joseph Kony’s Lords Resistance Army. Many of these people
are Internally Displaced Persons, have lost family members to the brutal raids
carried out by the LRA and are fighting to return home to live out their lives
in peace. Uganda’s emerging oil sector has displaced many of the people
returning home and left them without their traditional livelihoods. Engaging
the community in ethical inclusion in the oil sector and mitigating land rights
and potential conflict will be an important issue in guaranteeing the rights
and security of this valued community.
What We Need & What You GetHere's the deal- funding allotment will be two-fold:I am able to purchase all of the listed medical supplies through my employer, Alert First Aid. I will be getting it at cost. However, I will be asking you to purchase them at the retail price. The remaining balance after cost plus shipping, baggage fees and taxes will go towards my research. The very people who will benefit from the medical supplies will also benefit from my research. These surplus funds will go towards hiring translators, guides, and research assistants all of whom will be drawn from the same community.  Anything beyond this will go to other costs such as permits, transportation and research supplies. In this manner I can carry out my research while immediately contributing to the community in a meaningful and tangible way. I will also be volunteering my services as a medic at local emergency hospitals and hope to teach a community-based first aid course once I am on the ground and established.The ImpactUganda as a whole is considered a relatively stable African country. However, the northern region is largely cut off from the south and is in a geographically precarious area, bordering South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Service delivery, medical among them, is very unreliable and the transport of supplies to this region lacking. Further, the region is slowly recovering from 15 years of prolonged conflict with the LRA. The Acholi were routinely targeted for murder and mutilation, with many of their children kidnapped and turned into child soldiers and sex slaves. The Acholi were moved into IDP camps that at one point exceeded 1.8 million and were known to have some of the world's highest rates of mortality. Today, the north is trying to achieve stability. However, with high rates of unemployment, devastated traditional livelihoods, and land rights hanging in the balance, many are living in the deepest of poverty. The oil industry, which if managed correctly, could mean an economic resurgence for the north. I will be spending six months in Acholiland, researching existing data and interviewing community members, key stakeholders and government and industry officials. I have been tackling this issue for the past 7 months through my MA program, independent desk research and maintain a strong connection with my advisor who has close ties to the community. This will not be my sole source for funding but will provide vital resources that are needed in order to complete this research successfully. I am confident that through my research, which will focus directly on the needs of this community, I can make a meaningful contribution in encouraging the effective, safe and ethical inclusion of the Acholi in this vital sector.Lists of Medical Supplies for Purchase*your contributions will go to the collection of items based on need*you can contribute any amount - this will just give you an idea what your contribution will go towards*if I am unable to bring all of the supplies with me some will be shipped and some will be brought by my mother who is coming to Gulu later in the year.Emergency airways (infant, child, adult) Bag of 24 - $12 Box of 100 - $39Wound Dressing SuppliesCase of soaker pads (for blood) - $60Case of non-adherant pads - $80Case of gauze pads - $70Case of gauze roller bandage - $4010 boxes alcohol prep pads - $40ObstetricsObstetrics kits - $12 each10 Disposable vaginal spectrometers - $10Catheters10 per case - $20Intermittent catheters (50 per case)- $35Other supplies may be added based on evolving demands.

It is a small charity, founded in 1985 and aims to help the local people with day to day living and small community projects. It would be lovely if you could donate a small amount of money towards this cause, the money won't simply be given to the people, it will be put towards sustainable projects such as the construction of girls dormitories in order to ensure their safety and building an irrigation system to guarantee clean, fresh water all year round! I will be teaching English out there so a small amount of money will go towards text books and school uniform.</p><p>In total I am aiming to raising £800. I will do this in a variety of ways, this is my first option however, I am also going to plan a sponsored event such as a run or something physical to raise even more money. I am running stands at Coventry University once a month to help out a little bit more. Everyone who is joining me in Tanzania, on this project, will aim to raise a similar amount so that we have enough to fund each of the small projects. The money we all raise together is going towards community projects as listed above. The majority of the money is going to be put towards constructing the girls dormitories, the rest will be distributed around by purchasing the materials for building a netball pitch, a volleyball pitch and a playground. We need to come up with plans for preserving the farmers banana crops without using electricity so that all which don't get sold aren't just thrown away. </p><p>One of the schools we're visiting needs a new classroom so we hope we can raise enough money to fund that as this means it will be able to accommodate a greater number of pupils. All the projects are aimed to be sustainable, by providing fresh water, we will enable the locals to use this for farming and improve the areas health. If 4 people donate £20 each, there will be enough to provide school uniforms to one of the schools. If 20 people donate £10 each, you will all have raised enough money to build one netball pitch.</p><p>However, if we don't reach the goal we have aimed for we won't be able to help the Monduli district as much as we would have liked, we will be unable to have such a large impact meaning the local population may miss out on the irrigation system or a way of preserving the crops.

It is a small charity, founded in 1985 and aims to help the local people with day to day living and small community projects. It would be lovely if you could donate a small amount of money towards this cause, the money won't simply be given to the people, it will be put towards sustainable projects such as the construction of girls dormitories in order to ensure their safety and building an irrigation system to guarantee clean, fresh water all year round! I will be teaching English out there so a small amount of money will go towards text books and school uniform.In total I am aiming to raising £800. I will do this in a variety of ways, this is my first option however, I am also going to plan a sponsored event such as a run or something physical to raise even more money. I am running stands at Coventry University once a month to help out a little bit more. Everyone who is joining me in Tanzania, on this project, will aim to raise a similar amount so that we have enough to fund each of the small projects. The money we all raise together is going towards community projects as listed above. The majority of the money is going to be put towards constructing the girls dormitories, the rest will be distributed around by purchasing the materials for building a netball pitch, a volleyball pitch and a playground. We need to come up with plans for preserving the farmers banana crops without using electricity so that all which don't get sold aren't just thrown away. One of the schools we're visiting needs a new classroom so we hope we can raise enough money to fund that as this means it will be able to accommodate a greater number of pupils. All the projects are aimed to be sustainable, by providing fresh water, we will enable the locals to use this for farming and improve the areas health. If 4 people donate £20 each, there will be enough to provide school uniforms to one of the schools. If 20 people donate £10 each, you will all have raised enough money to build one netball pitch.However, if we don't reach the goal we have aimed for we won't be able to help the Monduli district as much as we would have liked, we will be unable to have such a large impact meaning the local population may miss out on the irrigation system or a way of preserving the crops. Hopefully this won't happen!I'd like to highlight that the irrigation project will provide water to 4,000 people. The farming projects (developing a tree seeding nursery and replanting trees) will help another 4,000 people so by donating you're helping another 8,000 people!This project is valuable to me and the world, many like this are taking place within the less developed countries and we are slowly making a difference.

<h3>A Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone. We're the Western Carolina Fencing club. We are a recently revitalized club in North Carolina and we are in serious need of proper equipment. Our club was established in 2007, but was not competitive and did not fundraise enough for new equipment. As a result, our new officers have been rebuilding the club from the ground up, and are making fantastic progress. We have our first tournaments slated for this semester, and are very much looking forward to them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our club does not currently have the equipment or funding that we need to send all of our fencers to competitions. As a result, we are limited to only three competitive fencers, and even then we are lacking in equipment.</p>
<p>In the past two years that we have taken to turn the club around, we have made a lot of progress, and many of our members are very passionate about the club. We meet twice a week and there is a lot of enthusiasm. As a whole, we would be incredibly grateful for any amount of funds that were donated to help us succeed.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Right now we have only been allotted 650 dollars from our campus club sports committee. While that seems like a fair amount, we have to use that money to pay for new equipment (which at maximum may cost up to $1,000), gas money, tournament fees per athlete, and uniforms.</p>
<p>We do offer perks to donors, which includes a signed thank you from the entire team, updates and pictures from our practices and tournaments, and a fencing glove signed by the entire WCU Fencing team. Sounds pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, then whatever funds we acquire will be used to enhance the equipment of the fencing club and/or pay for upkeep costs such as tournament fees and new equipment.</p>

<p>Goji berry is considered as the ""Super Fruit"" because studies show that it is packed with vitamins and high levels of antioxidants. Benefits of consuming goji berry regularly include:</p>
<ul>
<li>help delay premature aging</li>
<li>boost the immune system</li>
<li>lower cancer risks</li>
<li>maintain cardiovascular health</li>
<li>reduce blood glucose, cholesterol and obesity</li>
<li>good for our eyesight</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend goji berries because we have been adding them in our diets and we experienced many of the benefits towards enjoying a healthier lifestyle. Goji berries blend well with other ingredients because of their pleasant, tangy taste. They make valuable additions to soups, salads, meals and beverage. </p>

<p>It has been 20 years since Rwanda was bathed in blood from
history’s most effective killing spree. The brutal murder of nearly 1 million
people in 100 days by machetes and clubs was one of the most horrific and
tragic episodes in the 20th Century. </p>
<p>Rwanda is currently a country where 60 percent of the population lives
below the poverty line, life expectancy is 49 years, literacy is 70 percent,
and 400,000 children (60 percent of those under 20 years old) are orphans,
often living on the streets or being cared for by extended families in deprived
conditions. Many women are living with the traumatic consequences of rape and
violence and HIV/Aids infection which is often passed to their children through
breast milk.</p>
<p>The people of Rwanda have made much progress towards overcoming their traumatic past and are looking forward to a brighter future. As a country, Rwanda has a growing economy, still heavily based on
agriculture and tourism. and a population looking to further Rwanda's growth in
all areas of commerce, medicine and education. However, despite such  encouraging signs of recovery in recent years many problems remain within the spheres of health care and education.</p>

social well being of the Rwandan population. We work to alleviate poverty
and suffering through the provision of our social welfare, health and education programmes. Our work also helps to spread the love of God through care and compassion for all humankind and impact the moral well
being of the population.

To achieve these aims, Rwanda Legacy of Hope is currently recruiting volunteers! As part of our continuous programme of developing health care and educational support  planned for  2015-2017, we need skilled volunteers in the following areas:
- Consultant surgeons in plastic surgery, ENT and orthopaedics
- Nurses, physiotherapists,

- IT professionals and Teachers 
For further information  on how you can help, please visit our website:www.rwandalegacyofhope.com  and send us your details and area of expertise via contactus@rwandalegacyofhope.com (Future plans) you
can also help us by donating towards the costs of building a new hospital and technical school.     What We Need and What You Get

Every penny received goes to support our work in hospitals and schools  Rwanda - Legacy of Hope does not use funds received to support administration, staff or travel costs.
Breakdown of costs
Health insurance for 400 people @ £10 per month per capita for 1 year = £4,000
Purchase of 1 pick up vehicle for essential transport for materials and equipment  for hospitals, schools and general work for organisation  = £10,000
Food, and accommodation, transport for medical and educational volunteers = £5000
Administration £3000
HIV/Aids Awareness and Prevention programme for 50 women = £3,000
 Welfare of patients after operation £5000
Total-£30,000
Rwanda - Legacy of Hope is unique because it works with  people at grass roots level such as directors of hospitals, schools and community and church leaders. The Rwandan Ministry of Health and Education both endorse our work within the country. 
As a volunteer, you can use your skills and expertise to make a real and lasting difference to the some of the most disadvantaged people in a short space of time through engaging in a focused programme of delivery.
Participation in the work of Legacy of Hope provides an exhiliarating and exciting opportunity to experience at first hand the spectacular beauty of Rwanda, the Land of the Thousand Hills and the warm and generous hospitality of its people.

  The Impact

Annual
Report for 2012-2014 
Health care achievements
 260 patients operated on for Hernia repair surgery using mesh techniques
 52 patients received physiotherapy treatment

Donations made of medical kit and vital equipment including diathermy machines
400 people received basic health insurance 
Education achievements in local schools

 The work of Rwanda - Legacy of Hope helps to strengthen communities by empowering them through the provision of vital health care such as plastic surgery where there is a crucial shortage. Rwanda currently has 1 plastic surgeon  to serve the whole country and ENT and Orthopaedic surgery is equally a priority need.   With your help this good work will carry on and yes we can certainly achieve more.

  Risks and Challenges
The cost of meeting ongoing care and support to those patients requiring medication and post-operative treatment is a real challenge,  but we can overcome them that's why we are appealing to you to help us see this through smoothly.

THIS IS NOT TIMESHARE - NO EXTRA FEES OR ANY ORIENTATION
 This is Easy As Checking IN and OUT of a Hotel - No String attached.

My Name is Ed Blaze and I LOVE Miami! I travel to Miami Beach at least twice a year. With that many visits, I'm always searching for Best Hotel Deals, but not at just any hotel.



I only stay at 4 - 5 Star Hotels!
At least, that’s where I want to stay, but it NEVER happens
because of the outrageous prices charged by 5-star hotels!



Then I started thinking about this for some time and I figured:



I can't be the only one who wants a nice place to stay when they come to Miami

Everyone deserves the chance to stay at a 5-star luxury condo for a
weekend


Everyone deserves the chance to impress their date, wife, girlfriend,
boyfriend, husband… you get the idea




SO…
Why not crowdfund it?

Use your pledge for the date it is more convenient for yourself.

STARTING IN JULY 2015



These condos will come complete with all the amenities of 4- 5 Star Hotel offerto make this happen...We need to raise enough money to put as down payment for buying 20 luxury condos.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>50 Shades of Blue is a new dog toy company that was inspired by the vision of my dog's vision.</p>
<p>I am Nathan Higdon, and I started 50 Shades of Blue Dog Toys because my dog, Sam, had trouble playing fetch with yellow tennis balls. I did some research, and I realized that dogs see similar to color blind humans (Deuteranopia). After a search for Blue Balls, go ahead and laugh, I found that he could see the color Blue on his toys.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because I think that many dog owners are missing a way to visually stimulate their furry friends.</p>
<p>Contributors will be helping me take the business to the next level, which is a nationwide product launch online via Groupon.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I need funding to trademark the name and logo, order additional product and raw materials. We source the Blue Balls, but the rope toys are handmade from US materials and natural dyes (right here in my kitchen).</p>
<p>You may be wondering what you'll get in return. You will be getting some of the product for your dog. (Remember to keep your dog's chewing habits and preferences in mind. Always supervise their playtime!)</p>
<p>If the goal isn't reached, the funds will go toward completing as much as possible, and I'll continue to personally fund the rest. The immediate goals are to incorporate the business and trademark the products, then order more products (we're stockpiling for the product launch).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The value behind this product and your contribution is that dogs will have an opportunity to play with toys they can actually see. Keep in mind, you can see a Magenta car, but you may not want to play with it. This is to say that color can't always change a dog's preference in toys, and toys are are not suited for your dog's particular personality may be ignored or distructed just like the others.</p>
<p>We also want to support local humane societies through monthly drawings out of our customer base. Buying our toys can impact your local pet community.</p>

<p>Aroostook Hops is a small family farm in northern Maine, founded in 2009 by a husband and wife team of Jason Johnston &amp; Krista Delahunty.  At the time we started growing organic hops commercially, we were one of only three hops growers in the state of Maine.  We started out small, and now have 4 acres of hops (with 5 varieties to offer).  Some of our mature hops plants are 5-years old.  </p>
<p>We have both worked hard at our venture, and are proud of what we have accomplished up to now.  We have been recipients of two separate USDA Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education grants, been invited to present at the 2013 annual UVM Hops Conference, been featured in magazine and newspaper articles, and have been a part of a Maine state agriculture legislative tour of our northern-most Maine county, Aroostook county.</p>
<p>We were excited recently to have our hops featured in the “Crown Breaker Artisan Ale”, the 2013 Beer Advocate Extreme Beer Fest brew in collaboration with Dogfish Head Brewery, where all ingredients were sourced from small “mom and pop” operations like ours.</p>
<p>We have managed to pick by hand the last four seasons, but can’t sustain that kind of labor-intensive method with our increasing hops plant acreage and plant maturity.  We are launching an Indiegogo campaign to fund a small-scale commercial hops harvester and a tow-behind sprayer, which we need in order to continue to manage well what we grow.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Despite all the sweat and hard work we’ve put in the last five years, we are now at a point where we need help to move to the next level.  With four acres of hops to harvest in the coming years, it is imperative that we acquire a mechanical harvester to accomplish this.  Hand picking is just not feasible at this level!  </p>
<p>There are plans available through the UVM Hops team that we will use in collaboration with local experts to build.  The UVM-designed machine has been built initially for $35K, but we think we can tweak the design to be finished for under that – around $25-27K.   This will be the first commercial hops harvester in the state of Maine, and will represent a leap forward for the industry.  We also have plans to cooperate with other small hops growers for them to utilize the machinery and help them to grow. </p>
<p>We also need to purchase a bigger sprayer than what we currently use to combat the biggest threat to our organic crop: downy mildew.  We use organic growing methods, and will use the sprayer for OMRI certified products that will produce the best quality hops cones for our brewing customers.  This will cost about $3600 to purchase.</p>
<p>As a contributor to our fundraising campaign, you will receive unique perks that will allow you to publicly show your support.  Our logo will be added to some very stylish t-shirts, caps, pint glasses, and keychains, and handmade hops soap.  Depending on the reward level you choose, you can select the merchandise that most interests you. </p>
<p>Also, some reward levels provide you with a unique opportunity to experience the best of times at Aroostook Hops – how does an evening steak dinner for two with samplings of fresh hoppy beer sound?  Or are you interested in a personal tour of the hopyard?  How about an engraved brass plate mounted on an end pole that permanently names a full row of hops after you or someone special?</p>
<p>Your support will help us to accomplish our goals and further the hop growing effort in Maine, and we hope that the reward we offer will be meaningful and worthwhile to you, in turn.  Check out our Indiegogo campaign now, and join in this exciting venture as we “grow” together!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>There is an increasing interest in local and organically produced hops in the Northeast, as well as in craft brewing.  With our experience and knowledge, we are positioned as leaders in the field and are happy to share with others what we have learned. </p>
<p>We have a successful track record of receiving grants, publishing scientific papers, and delivering talks on in our field.  We will approach a successfully-funded Indiegogo campaign in the same way we have approached every other project we have taken on together – with responsibility, hard work, and true integrity. </p>
<p>Your contribution to our campaign will have a huge impact… we have worked so hard and called on every generous volunteer to get the fall harvest in the last couple of years, but without mechanized harvesting, we cannot continue to keep up to the amount of vines to be picked.  We need you to help – and every contribution will be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We understand that not everyone can contribute financially to a campaign.  However, your greatest value may be your voice – you can make a huge difference if you get the word out and make some noise about our campaign!  Use the Indiegogo “share” tools, use Facebook and email, whatever gets more people involved.  Encourage your contacts to also share with their contacts – we only have 50 days to make this happen, and every person reached helps.  Thanks for your support in revitalizing the hops industry in the Northeast!</p>

<h3>Please Be Joe's Hero!</h3>
<p>Welcome to the crowd funding page that will hopefully help us give Joe the best bachelor party any human has ever had. As you probably know, Las Vegas can be quite an expensive and exhausting trip, so what we are trying to do is raise enough money to make it slightly less expensive and even more exhausting.</p>
<p>Yes, we could do Vegas the cheap way, but why do the $29 room, fly in the cargo hull of the plane and eat at the $.99 buffet when you have GREAT friends and family that will help pay for the penthouse suites, first class flight and the best restaurants in the world!!!! Don't you think Joe deserves to sit back in his big leather first class seat, sip on a delicious Zima, and enjoy the flight? So do we! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What this mess is gonna cost us?</h3>
<p>Now of course, with all my Las Vegas expertise (trust me, I'm a professional), I would like to give you a little taste of what this place costs...</p>
<p><strong>Limo to airport - $60 </strong>(each way)</p>
<p><strong>Airfare - $400</strong> and rising!</p>
<p><strong>Hotel -   $400 </strong>(Nice room, no penthouse....sigh)</p>
<p><strong>Food - $300 </strong>(no $.99 buffets for this kid!)</p>
<p><strong>Adult beverages - $301+</strong>(yes, the booze is always more than the food and this is a low estimate when drinks are $18 each. That's less than five drinks a day. Very respectable, Mom.)</p>
<p><strong>Water - $50 </strong>(Do you have any idea how hungover he'll be after all that booze?)</p>
<p><strong>Gambling - $25,000</strong> (Gambling losses are a write-off)</p>
<p>Bail Monday - depending on the level of severity... $5000?</p>
<p>Ok, OK so without the $25k in tax write-offs and bail momey, we are already over $1500!!! You get the point, this isn't your standard trip to the Tailgate Tavern. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<p>Fine, if you're going to be selfish about it....</p>
<p>Check out the pretty sick options on the right hand side of this screen. Yea, I know, PRETTY SICK. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Essentially....</h3>
<p>We need you more than you need us, but who doesn't love Joey B? I know everyone wants this kid to have the time of his life! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know not everyone has the extra money to send our way (hell, that's how I got here in the first place), but we would really appreciate it if you could share this with all of your extremely famous, wealthy and media mogul friends. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello!  My name is Wade Marrs and I am a 22 year old dog sled racer.  This project is to help me fund my dreams of winning the Copper Basin Race, The Sheep Mountain, and the Iditarod.  In case you are unsure what these races are...they are dog sled races, or some would call it mushing. I have been competing since 2007 and have won a few smaller races as well as the Junior Iditarod.    I love all of my dogs and I feel this year will be a great year competitively for me and my team.   </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello!  My name is Wade Marrs and I am a 22 year old dog sled racer.  This project is to help me fund my dreams of winning the Copper Basin Race, The Sheep Mountain, and the Iditarod.  In case you are unsure what these races are...they are dog sled races, or some would call it mushing. I have been competing since 2007 and have won a few smaller races as well as the Junior Iditarod.    I love all of my dogs and I feel this year will be a great year competitively for me and my team.

Our
Story: So
what is fuel? 
Another
hole-in-the-wall restaurant? 

Not
exactly. 

Only
a restaurant?  

Not
exactly.
You
want a thick greasy burger and a super-sized candy-water? But
that's not who we are; it's not on our map. We can't even tell
you how to get there. Not in good conscience.Suppose you
try this instead? fuel is ....
Whatever
we can think of. Whatever makes sense. And big sense of fun.


An
alternative to bottom-line, bottom-dollar, business-as-usual
capitalism.You've seen restauranteurs who believe the quality
of food is more important than the quality of the life of a
community. That's not what we believe. That philosophy would never
get us to our destination.
We
offer the finest and
freshest in Plant-based, Grain-based, Eco-focused
cuisine. 

We
are Kalamazoo's only completely vegetarian and
vegan-friendly restaurant and a deliberate rip in
the fabric of the all too-typical, modern American
food-ways. 
Our
Food: Unpredictably
vegetarian

Soupsvegan

vegetarian)
Salads

choices include:
brown mustard dressing, various fresh vinagrettes and herbed olive
oils, creamy garlic, herbed yogurt. 
other
additions or options: you can add any protein of your choice
and/or a vegan or conventional cheese option to the salads above or
take anything away

plate of the daymofongo
plate
– a deconstructed interpretation of a puerto rican classic. Mashed
green plantains, vegan chickenish and baconish, black beans and
ajillo (garlic pepper sauce). Just bean option available. Or a
southern
plate
– whole grain malted waffles, cream of wheat crusted & southern
fried vegan chickenish, mixed potato and red cabbage cake, with
bourbon maple syrup and a mustard green compound butter. Or head to
the other south with a creole
plate
– shrimpish remoulade with crusty baguette, blackened green beans
and red onion jam. If you feel far from home, try the comfort
plate –
meatish loaf, smashed potatoes, scratch made biscuit, seasonal
vegetable, butter of the day. You could even create
your own spread 
– choose any protein and two sides. Don't worry, we have pasta and
sandwiches too. And again, we let you choose. So try our day
pasta with made
to order sauce options or our chicago dog kalamazoo style, or a
sloppy joe or burgerish stuffed with feta or vegan pepper jack cheese
and dressed with arugula, whole grain mustard and capers
on Multi-Grain local and toasted Artisan Bread.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Since we met our goal so fast, <b>we’re adding a stretch goal to raise an additional $1,200 to launch a Safe Transportation Fund.</b> We love the new space, but unfortunately its location is less convenient for many of our members. Our neighborhood is mostly commercial &amp; industrial, so there's not a lot going on at night, and walking to nearby public transportation can feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Some of our members use Lyft or Uber to get home, but not all of our members can afford to. In order to keep our space accessible, it’s critical that our members are able to access the space safely without a large financial burden. Our goal is to create a shared Lyft account that members may use to travel short distances to or from the space when they don't have another option they feel comfortable with. We've estimated this cost at $100/mo and would like to raise enough money for a year of safe transportation.</span></p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>Double Union is a San Francisco-based hacker + maker space for women to work on their projects, whether they’re coding, sewing, soldering, making zines, screenprinting or using power tools. We’re supporting a culture where we don’t just make awesome stuff—we also ask questions, break things and feel confused sometimes. We are intersectional feminists, women-centered, and queer- and trans-inclusive. As women fight for equality in <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/03/26/silicon-valley-gender-gap-widening/70444276/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the tech sector</a>, <a href=""http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/10/huge-gender-gap-in-scientific-funding.html#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the sciences</a>, and <a href=""http://flavorwire.com/514177/equal-pay-day-how-women-get-stiffed-in-media-and-the-arts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the arts</a>, spaces like Double Union are especially important—but, unfortunately, are rare.</span></p>
<p>Double Union was founded in 2013 to provide a safe community workshop for women. We’ve grown a lot in the past two years, with now over 180 members and more tools, supplies and events than ever.

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Many, many creative spaces have been pushed out of San Francisco. After two years operating in the heart of the city’s Mission District, Double Union was almost one those casualties. Last month,<b> we and the other non-profit tenants of the historic Fog Building on Valencia St. were evicted so the new landlord could renovate the building.</b> We weren't planning to move anytime soon and we had to act fast to save our beloved hackerspace.</p>
<p>We were lucky enough to find a new location in the Portero Hill neighborhood, not far from San Francisco’s growing Dogpatch. It’s much larger, fully ADA compliant, and its industrial location will allow us to work on bigger, noisier projects. The downside is that the rent is much more expensive. At $3,500 per month, it's more than double what we were paying before the move. Although we have plans to stabilize our finances, we need short-term help!</p>
<p>Double Union is primarily supported by member dues, which are on a sliding scale from $10 to $50 a month, with current average dues per paying member at $20/mo. We also offer scholarships to members who cannot afford to pay. We are not considering raising the dues requirements for our members—it’s critical to our mission to stay accessible to people with low or no income. <b>With any size donation, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">you will help keep a safe space open in San Francisco for women to learn, collaborate, and work on their projects.</span></b></p>

<p>As a fairly young non-profit, we were required to pay a security deposit equal to three months’ rent. We also spent about $1,000 on moving supplies and assistance. We were able to pull the money together to move in, but now we need your help. We currently make a total of $3,000/mo from member dues, which isn’t enough to cover rent and other expenses.

<p>In addition to the fun items we can send you, many of our extremely talented members have offered their time to teach and consult with donors on a variety of subjects. We can help you with your business, research or project—or teach you a new skill!</p>

<p>Hi!  My name is Kristi Shepherd.  I am a 61-year-old woman in a high stress profession.  And just like most women, I have a lot going on.  Work, home, spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, extended family, friends.  There really isn't time to take care of me.</p>
<p>And then, there is the issue of aging and your skin changing.  And suddenly, how you've cared for your skin in the past just isn't working anymore.</p>
<p>That is what happened to me this year.  Once I hit 60, I started having acne like I never had in high school.  No amount of make-up could cover it.  And I never felt pretty.</p>
<p>So, I invested in a high cost acne treatment that got rid of the pimples, but my ""beautiful skin"" became dry and wrinkled, and looked tired and stressed.  I tried, but couldn't find a moisturizer that could bring back the skin I had before.</p>
<p>That is how Reprise Skincare got started.  After a lot of research, trial and error, I developed a facial cleansing oil, and skin scrub that helped me to recapture the skin I was born with.  And yes, I did it in my kitchen!  All of the products are made with 100% pure, natural ingredients - you don't need to refer to your old chemistry book to know what you are putting on your skin!</p>
<p>The products are simple to use.  And unless you feel you need it, no additional moisturizing is needed.  That saves time and money.</p>
<p>I want you to know that this is so much more than just a business idea for me.  As is the case in almost all of the projects we work on, Reprise Skincare will do well by doing good.  These are the underlying values that will drive our business development and growth:</p>
<p>NUMBER 1 – We will only use 100% pure and natural ingredients in our products, and will source ingredients that are produced locally whenever possible.  We believe in in supporting local farmers and other small businesses.</p>
<p>NUMBER 2 – We will partner with nonprofits that work to empower immigrants and young women to hire our workers, and mentor and teach them business development and management while paying them a decent wage to produce our products.</p>
<p>AND NUMBER 3 – We are committed to making our high quality products affordable and accessible to all.   High quality beauty products are expensive, and when researching the cost of similar oil facial cleansers, prices ranged from $50 to $125 for a 2 ounce bottle.  <strong>Our 4 ounce bottles of facial cleanser will be priced at $22.50.</strong>  All of our products will be priced at $25 or less, making them affordable because all women deserve to feel beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>I have a goal of reaching $50,000 from this campaign.</strong>  This will allow me to more fully and formally set up the business entity, further source and purchase the 100% pure, natural ingredients, design and produce packaging, set up a small manufacturing facility, hire employees to produce the product and develop and execute comprehensive marketing and public relations plans.  We plan to market and sell the products primarily using social media and online sales platforms, with a limited amount of product carried in small boutiques in Minnesota. </p>
<p>To reach my goal, I am asking YOU to pre-purchase $135 worth of Reprise Skincare products and accessories at $100.  <strong>For just $100, you will receive:  </strong>One 4 ounce bottle of grapeseed oil based Daily Facial Cleanser for morning; one 4 ounce bottle of sunflower oil based Extra Moisturizing Facial Cleanser for evening; one 6 ounce container of each Facial Cleanser for refills; one 16 ounce container of Salt Skin Scrub; a Reprise 100% cotton washcloth to use with the facial cleanser; and a turban/headband to use when you wash your face.</p>
<p><strong>This is a $135 value for just $100!  And your package will arrive in time for the holidays.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to financial support, I also ask for your feedback after you've tried the products and your willingness to <strong>forward this opportunity on to others you know who want to be part of something that makes women feel beautiful and helps someone do well and do good. </strong></p>
<p>Help me get this business started!  Please join me in bringing pure and natural skincare products to the marketplace and help all women recapture the skin they were born with.  <strong>You personally will benefit from our products and be part of something that does good for the broader community.</strong></p>
<p>THANK YOU!</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>The
year was 2007. And Rebecca Andersson was noticing something: She could not
afford to feed her family the kind of food she wanted to -- local, organic and healthy
fruits, vegetables and meats. She wanted food she could trust, at a price she
could afford. </p>
<p>From
that, Know Thy Food began. It started as a food-buying club where families
would buy produce, eggs, milk, and meat in bulk from local farmers and
ranchers. They would meet in Rebecca’s driveway to split the bounty. It grew
quickly, and four years later they needed a larger location. </p>
<p>Know
Thy Food moved in 2012 to the Brooklyn neighborhood in SE Portland. It is the only source of high-quality, local food in that neighborhood. And
by merging the food-buying club with a café and market, Know Thy Food is serving as a
model for how other food co-ops can become vibrant, food-based cornerstones for
their communities. By connecting with farmers directly, we shorten the food chain,
therefore ensuring more of each dollar we spend goes directly into farmers’
hands. We are helping ensure a sustainable food system now and into the future.</p>
<p>Success,
right? Almost. Business has increased. We’ve added new members. And we’ve added
new farmers and producers to our ranks. What we need now is to improve our
storefront and infrastructure to support this growth, and reach our next goals.
</p>
<p>We
need your help, because if we have learned anything in these nine years, it is
that we are nothing without community. We want to grow and continue to feed the
community with vital, healthy food. We want to support and expand our local sustainable food system. And we want to serve as a model for other food co-ops. To do that, Know Thy Food needs:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>A
better point-of-sale system to track inventory, increase accuracy of sales,
increase speed of transactions, and increase sale transparency with itemized
receipts.</p>
<p>·<span>  An improved</span> storefront to attract more customers and improve the experience of existing
customers.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">·</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  Brighter and more efficient lighting.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>·  New coolers! (That loud buzzing? That’s the sound of our outdated produce coolers that also freeze our produce and contribute to food waste).<span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Because
Portland’s Brooklyn neighborhood is one of Metro’s (regional governing body)
areas of development, we have an opportunity to double our investment capital
through a matching grant program of up to 50,000 dollars. This is an amazing
opportunity for a small business like Know Thy Food Cooperative. We are
partnering with our landlord and two neighboring businesses to raise the funds
needed to match this Metro grant. Every dollar we raise will help us secure this
Metro business development grant.</p>
<p>We
are seeking the funds from the neighborhood AND those who care about locally
sourced, farm-to-table, environmentally friendly food and products at
reasonable prices. We are seeking support from anyone who values food
cooperatives and sustainable local food systems. </p>

<p>Know Thy Food Cooperative is like no
other business I know in Portland. I learned of it when I moved to Brooklyn
neighborhood 5 years ago. I saw the sign in the back of the building which
stated Know Thy Food Community Supported Pantry. As a believer in community
supported agriculture and local food systems I was intrigued. Now five years
later I am a member, customer and volunteer, and I am not sure what my family
would do without it. </p>
<p>Our café consistently ranks among the top five most
family-friendly cafés in Portland. And it is the only place, in all of
Portland, that allows you to go online after your kids go to bed, and put in an
order for the region’s finest produce, meat, dairy and eggs to be delivered at
the café the next week. It is also the only food cooperative I know that houses
local performers to entertain your child(ren) while you shop or enjoy a stellar
cappuccino. We have members who drive in from the suburbs -- Beaverton,
Vancouver, Lake Oswego and Hillsboro -- because we are the only cooperative in
the Metro region that offers access to raw milk collectives, good pricing on
bones and organ meats from pastured animals, and the ability to order spices,
dried goods, household products and more wholesale. Know thy Food has
completely revolutionized my family’s grocery shopping experience without
having compromised any of our values. This is a business that is worth
supporting and a business model that depends on community support.</p>
<p><span>Our goals are ambitious.
And your investment, perhaps, seems risky. The staff and
board of the cooperative are aware of these risks, and one of the reasons we
are looking to a crowd-sourcing campaign rather than a traditional business
loan is that as a cooperative, we believe in shared, collective risk. We
believe that when a community comes together, each taking on a bit of risk, we all
become invested in helping the business thrive.</span></p>
<p>Join me, the rest of our volunteer board, our staff, and our

</div><p></p></div>","The
year was 2007. And Rebecca Andersson was noticing something: She could not
afford to feed her family the kind of food she wanted to -- local, organic and healthy
fruits, vegetables and meats. She wanted food she could trust, at a price she
could afford. 
From
that, Know Thy Food began. It started as a food-buying club where families
would buy produce, eggs, milk, and meat in bulk from local farmers and
ranchers. They would meet in Rebecca’s driveway to split the bounty. It grew
quickly, and four years later they needed a larger location. 
Know
Thy Food moved in 2012 to the Brooklyn neighborhood in SE Portland. It is the only source of high-quality, local food in that neighborhood. And
by merging the food-buying club with a café and market, Know Thy Food is serving as a
model for how other food co-ops can become vibrant, food-based cornerstones for
their communities. By connecting with farmers directly, we shorten the food chain,
therefore ensuring more of each dollar we spend goes directly into farmers’
hands. We are helping ensure a sustainable food system now and into the future.
Success,
right? Almost. Business has increased. We’ve added new members. And we’ve added
new farmers and producers to our ranks. What we need now is to improve our
storefront and infrastructure to support this growth, and reach our next goals.

We
need your help, because if we have learned anything in these nine years, it is
that we are nothing without community. We want to grow and continue to feed the
community with vital, healthy food. We want to support and expand our local sustainable food system. And we want to serve as a model for other food co-ops. To do that, Know Thy Food needs:
· 
A
better point-of-sale system to track inventory, increase accuracy of sales,
increase speed of transactions, and increase sale transparency with itemized
receipts.
·  An improved storefront to attract more customers and improve the experience of existing
customers.
·  Brighter and more efficient lighting.

·  New coolers! (That loud buzzing? That’s the sound of our outdated produce coolers that also freeze our produce and contribute to food waste). 

Because
Portland’s Brooklyn neighborhood is one of Metro’s (regional governing body)
areas of development, we have an opportunity to double our investment capital
through a matching grant program of up to 50,000 dollars. This is an amazing
opportunity for a small business like Know Thy Food Cooperative. We are
partnering with our landlord and two neighboring businesses to raise the funds
needed to match this Metro grant. Every dollar we raise will help us secure this
Metro business development grant.
We
are seeking the funds from the neighborhood AND those who care about locally
sourced, farm-to-table, environmentally friendly food and products at
reasonable prices. We are seeking support from anyone who values food
cooperatives and sustainable local food systems.

<p>Georg and Felix liked to start a company, that has a sustainable, fair and social vision. They love nature, the earth we live on and the green lifestyle. They noticed that you can wear ecofriendly clothes, eat Fairtrade-food and live in an energy efficient home. But ecofriendly, fair produced furniture can rarely be found in the warehouses. That's why they started to create a crowdfunding campaign to find supporters for <strong>green and sustainable furniture</strong>. Because the RELAXFAIR Lounge is just the beginning.</p>

<h3><strong>1. THE PRODUCT</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What is the RELAXFAIR Lounge?</strong></p>
<p>The Relaxfair Lounge is the World’s fairest and greenest Lounge. All materials and fillings are recycled, the Lounges are handmade in Germany and 20% of all profits will be donated to social and green organizations. The Lounge is also very comfortable and cozy. Perfect for your lifestyle!</p>
<p><strong>What kind of materials does RELAXFAIR use?</strong></p>
<p>You can choose between water- and dirt repellent nylon for the outdoor usage or the comfortable and stylish cotton-polyester for your living room. All materials are 100% recycled.</p>
<p><strong>Which colors are available?</strong></p>
<p>At the start of the campaign these colors are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indoor version: Grey &amp; beige</li>
<li>Outdoor version: Anthracite &amp; aqua</li>
</ul>
<p>You want your RELAXFAIR in another color? We have stretch goals and if we reach the goals, you can choose between more colors:</p>

<p><strong>What's the maximum weight capacity of the RELAXFAIR Lounge?</strong></p>

INTRODUCING
 
 
RELAXFAIR INDOOR: COZY & STYLISH
The Indoor version uses a fabric made of recycled cotton and polyester. It therefore suits the style of your living room, winter garden or your children's room. The material is very comfortable and cozy for the best relaxation experience ever.
 
RELAXFAIR OUTDOOR: BEST RELAXATION The outdoor version of the RELAXFAIR Lounge uses a recycled nylon. Because nylon is very tear proof, dirt and water repellent, the RELAXFAIR Lounge is the perfect furniture to use outdoor in your garden or on your terrace. You can even leave it in the rain.
 
RELAXFAIR FILLINGS: EASY TO CARE
  
All RELAXFAIR Lounges have an innovative two-chamber-filling-system for a better seating position. They are filled with recycled polystyrene and sustainable foam flakes.
  
If your RELAXFAIR is dirty – you can simply wipe it away or separate the shell and the filling chambers and wash it in the washing machine.
 
 

 
RELAXFAIR IS SUSTAINABLE
We at RELAXFAIR use recycled and sustainable fabrics for our products believing that it is possible to enjoy great designed furniture and to protect the environment.

 
RELAXFAIR IS FAIR
All RELAXFAIRs are produced under fair working conditions. The Lounge is handmade by qualified and well paid seamstresses in Germany. It guarantees the highest quality and the ultimate comfort.


 
RELAXFAIR IS SOCIAL
In addition, we want to be socially responsible. We believe that living together is better than working against each other. Therefore, RELAXFAIR donates 20% of its profits to social and green organizations - reinvesting in the society that believes in our vision.

 
 

  
The Indoor version uses a fabric made of recycled cotton and polyester. It also comes in grey and beige.

1. THE PRODUCT
What is the RELAXFAIR Lounge?
The Relaxfair Lounge is the World’s fairest and greenest Lounge. All materials and fillings are recycled, the Lounges are handmade in Germany and 20% of all profits will be donated to social and green organizations. The Lounge is also very comfortable and cozy. Perfect for your lifestyle!
What kind of materials does RELAXFAIR use?
You can choose between water- and dirt repellent nylon for the outdoor usage or the comfortable and stylish cotton-polyester for your living room. All materials are 100% recycled.
Which colors are available?
At the start of the campaign these colors are available:

Indoor version: Grey & beige
Outdoor version: Anthracite & aqua

You want your RELAXFAIR in another color? We have stretch goals and if we reach the goals, you can choose between more colors:

Goal: 3,000$: New indoor color: red
Goal: 6,000$: New indoor color: anthracite
Goal: 50.000$: New outdoor color: lemon

Can the RELAXFAIR be used on water? No, the RELAXFAIR Outdoor Version is water-repellent, but not waterproof. In our test we left a nylon RELAXFAIR outside during the whole winter and the RELAXFAIR was still perfect.
What's the maximum weight capacity of the RELAXFAIR Lounge?
The RELAXFAIR Lounge can easily withstand the weight of three adults, which is around 250 kg (551 Lbs.).  But sitting alone is more convenient ;-)
How much does the RELAXFAIR products weigh and what is the size?

Can I wash the RELAXFAIR products?
Yes, if the RELAXFAIR is dirty, you can take off the shell and wash it in the washing machine. your lounge will look brand new!
 
2. PURCHASING
When can I choose the color and material of my RELAXFAIR?
We will send out a survey during and at the end of the campaign in which you can select your color & material. If you've purchased more than one RELAXFAIR product, you can choose different colors & materials!
How do I choose more than one perk?
Unfortunately, the Indiegogo system is not set up to choose more than one perk. If you would like to choose more, you need to order the next perk in a separate process. If you need help please write us: info@relaxfair.com.
I preordered a RELAXFAIR, but I didn’t get a confirmation email. How can I check the status?
Here do you find more information. If you have further questions, please contact support@indiegogo.com.
There was an error with my contribution. What happened?
Please check out this Indiegogo article. There you can find helpful solutions.
Why am I checking out through Indiegogo?
Crowdfunding is a great way to finance a project. The supporter community decides which projects are good for all of us. Our founders Felix and Georg also supported other projects and loved the community, the updates and perks. Crowdfunding is very transparent with all information about stats, product & company information. We hope to get the full support of the community!
I can't get my payment to work in Paypal, what should I do?
Email Indiegogo at support@indiegogo.com. They'll be able to track your transaction and help with any issues.
Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT?
The backer is responsible, please check your country's import duties before purchasing. You can check this duty calculator to get started.
I accidentally ordered the wrong color/ put in the wrong address/ want to upgrade my perk. What can I do?
Please email us: With your full name, address, Indiegogo account name, and the details of your issue. We will help you quickly.
 
3. SHIPPING
When will I receive my RELAXFAIR?
We are doing our best to start shipping to you as soon as possible. We are a small company and right now we only have materials for 150 RELAXFAIR Indoor Lounges & Ottomans. After the campaign we plan on purchasing new materials, so the other customers should receive their RELAXFAIRs until the end of February 2017.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It will take $21,000 to pull off the work we have planned, including a massive and crucial project of re-roofing the front barn so that it can withstand more years of rocking all night long full of sweaty queers. We can coordinate up to 100 participants, so we're asking all participants to raise $200 each in order to fund this work as a gift to IDA. But IDA's community tends towards the very low-income, and many participants have tons of love and energy to give but are able not able to raise the money to travel to IDA, miss a week of work, and contribute to the cost of materials. We are holding benefit events in Philadelphia, NYC, the Bay Area, Pittsburgh, Denver, Providence, and beyond... and we still need your help. To raise this money, we need to meet or exceed this goal of $2,500 in donations from friends and allies that can't make it to the work gathering, or don't live in a city with a benefit party, but have some funds to kick down for strengthening and sustaining IDA. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word through your networks! Tell your friends how much IDA has meant to you and ask them to support this project. Every year, IDA has over 500 visitors -- we know that there is enough support to raise the funds we need, and more, if our community gives what they can. No gift is too small or too big! </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style="""">Dear Friends,</p>
<br/><p class=""LetterBody"" style="""">For those of you who don’t know, I am in Kenya for 5 months to try to help build a Children's Home (or at least help it get rolling) and I'd like to  tell you about it. A year ago, I took a month leave to visit the Belwop Children’s Home in Nyeri, Kenya. I stayed on-site with the kids and with the director, a widow and fellow believer named Veronica Mumbi, whom I am blessed to call friend.This trip ruined me, in the best way, and now I feel called to help make a difference here, and would invite you to join the cause.</p>
<p class=""LetterBody"" style="""">Basically, the verse in James that states that TRUE Religion, the kind that that God accepts as pure and faultless-- <span style=""color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-style: italic;"">HOLY</span>-- is just this: To take care of widows and orphans in their distress... that's it. Then I met a widow who takes care of orphans, whose faith is unlike anything I've ever witnessed, and realized maybe this wasn't an accident? Here was  a opportunity for religion to be put into action, for me, and anyone who wants to join. A need for a real home.</p>
<p class=""LetterBody"" style="""">Our ""True Religion"" efforts began 4 years ago, and today, we have partnerships starting all over the place to make this dream a reality. Together, through making coffee, and playing music, selling T-shirts and bracelets, word-of-mouth, Indiegogo, and dinners we have helped them come out of debt, purchase land, and now we want to move forward. No longer will these amazing kids have to sleep in a rented facility or worry about their next meal. Soon, they will have a place to sleep with colorful walls and comfortable beds and a kitchen full of food.</p>
<p class=""LetterBody"" style="""">But we have a ways to go.....</p>

</div></div>","Our Story

Dear Friends,
For those of you who don’t know, I am in Kenya for 5 months to try to help build a Children's Home (or at least help it get rolling) and I'd like to  tell you about it. A year ago, I took a month leave to visit the Belwop Children’s Home in Nyeri, Kenya. I stayed on-site with the kids and with the director, a widow and fellow believer named Veronica Mumbi, whom I am blessed to call friend.This trip ruined me, in the best way, and now I feel called to help make a difference here, and would invite you to join the cause.
Basically, the verse in James that states that TRUE Religion, the kind that that God accepts as pure and faultless-- HOLY-- is just this: To take care of widows and orphans in their distress... that's it. Then I met a widow who takes care of orphans, whose faith is unlike anything I've ever witnessed, and realized maybe this wasn't an accident? Here was  a opportunity for religion to be put into action, for me, and anyone who wants to join. A need for a real home.
Our ""True Religion"" efforts began 4 years ago, and today, we have partnerships starting all over the place to make this dream a reality. Together, through making coffee, and playing music, selling T-shirts and bracelets, word-of-mouth, Indiegogo, and dinners we have helped them come out of debt, purchase land, and now we want to move forward. No longer will these amazing kids have to sleep in a rented facility or worry about their next meal. Soon, they will have a place to sleep with colorful walls and comfortable beds and a kitchen full of food.
But we have a ways to go.....

THE IMPACT
 SO far, through giving of funds from the last Indiegogo site, True Religion Concert series and other fundraisers, we have raised enough to:
1.) buy 1 square acre of Land!
2.) Buy an 8 passenger van!!!!
3.) sponsor the kids and send them to private school
4.) feed them
...and MORE explained in a letter from Veronica (the awesome Widow who runs the Belwop orphanage, my inspiration and friend):
Dear ones,
Because of you, the children can now enjoy an after-school snack, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Because of you, they can eat meat at least two days every week.
Because of you, they can eat fruits as frequently as possible.
Because of you, the children can have butter on their bread.
Because of you, the children can have sausage at least twice a week.
Because of you, they can have ice cream once in a while.
Because of you, the children are always clean and smart, for bathing and washing soaps and detergents are no longer a problem.
Because of you, the children can praise their God with much joy.







HOW TO HELP
 
We have found a home, and it may be ""the One,"" and as we talk to the bank about a loan to purchase it, and churches and organizations to give, I have committed to using my time here at max capacity. This time, I am setting up this Indiegogo thing to raise support to start up the new ""Shamba,"" or income FARM, to help cover costs of food at Belwop!!  As we wait, 2 things we know for certain:

1. We still own this land. 
2. We want to be good stewards, and USE IT in the meantime!

 While I am here, and with the help of Biointensive Growers from G-BIACK (a nearby agriculture school), we can set up a 1-5 acre farm that will provide healthy, mostly organically grown food and cash for the home. A representative will be visiting in two weeks to help us plan it out, and we are digging the trenches to set up the water.
I already bought my ticket, and have saved up enough to sustain myself, but some of you have expressed a desire to help me financially, and so all the money you give here goes directly to breaking ground on the new Belwop Farm site... By the time I return in December I would like to see the farm flourishing! (As we are now headed into spring and summer) and the Home is being purchased:



1.) Water line (dug and placed in the ground, connected to the well up the hill) ($1,200)
2.) Fence built ($1,500 for 5 acres)
3.) Treeline planted (Free by the Green Belt Movement!) ($0)
4.) Flourishing beds of corn, beans, cale, cabbage, tomatoes, sweet potatoes and more! ($1,000 for upkeep)
 5.) A full-time biointensively trained farmer, hired locally at $3/ day ($1,095/ year)

Once I leave, there are others coming after me to continue the building of Belwop 2.0. This will lead to the completion of the new home and Veronica's WISH LIST:
Full indoor kitchen
10 Bedrooms (10 kids, 5 bunkbeds per room= 100 kids!)
Washer and Dryer
4 bathrooms
Living room
Study
Staff

<p>I’ve gone through the steps of getting a business degree, a certificate in brewing, practical hands on brewing experience at a local brew pub and formulating my own recipes at home. I’ve already incorporated the brewery and secured the brewery name. Now all I need is some start up capital to get me brewing.<br/><br/>By donating to this brewery you will help give the people of the Fraser Valley more choice in the beers that they drink. You will also help me succeed in a life long dream of owning a brewery and giving back to the community.</p>
<p>The money that you donate will be used to help buy a 10 barrel brewing system ($55,000) so we can produce about 3000 6pks a week, bottling line ($15,000) to get the product to you, and start up materials ($20,000) ie. malts, hops, cartons, etc. It will also help with the licensing aspects and renting a brewing space. After which you can come into our tasting room and try our delicious beers.</p>
<p>For your generous donations you’ll receive all sorts of stuff. The full list can be seen on the right side of your screen but they go from a simple thank you post card, to pre buying a case of beer, to being invited to a special launch party, to being one of an exclusive group of only 20 people to sample new beers before any are made available to the public, to being able to design your own beer.</p>
<p>Without your help I can’t make this brewery happen and I know that you love craft beer, so please help me out by making a donation and/or tell your friends and family about this project. You and they can be a part of the history of Crazy Canuck Brewing. Come with me on this journey, it will be fun. </p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p> </p>
<p>P.S. If there is a reward that you would like but don't see listed contact us at <a href=""mailto:crazycanuckbrewing@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">crazycanuckbrewing@gmail.com</a> and we'll see what we can work out.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As many of you know, The S'Cream Truck has managed to make quite an entrance in our 9 short months of business.</p>
<p>Started in early 2012 by two single moms who unexpectedly had to make mid-life changes, we worked hard and opened the truck on our own (with the financial help of friends and family) and within these short months have catered some of the top TV shows, celebrity private parties, food truck events, and gained a lot of press (Zagat's Food Truck of the Week, Eater LA, Curbed LA and the cover of Frontiers Magazine).</p>
<p>It is now time to move into merchandising. People love our branding and our tagline, ""We Have Balls"" so much, that we reached into our own small pockets and did a run of 100 women's tees. We have sold out and have a demand for more.</p>
<p>Now we are trying to raise the money to do a larger order, raise our online presence with some marketing help (our new website launches in the next week or two) and be able to fill and ship orders as needed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $6,000 to hire a pr/marketing firm short term to increase our online presence so we can move our merchandising in a big way, not just locally. Our branding has been visible and making a name for itself, including our line ""We Have Balls"", which refers to our trademarked product, The S'Cream Ball.</p>
<p>You get to enjoy the perks listed below, but also be in on the beginning of what we think will be a knowable and desired brand on the market.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We know not everyone can contribute, but it sure would help for you to spread the word! Share our link, tell others how cool our shirts are and how awesome our ice cream and truck is. And how fantastic it would be to help two single moms make their dreams come true! (i.e., college for their kids :) )</p>
<p>It's easy, just use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

The Causes
So, we would love for you to help us by helping others through donating to charities below. We have hand-picked these charities as each one means something to us, as their work has affected and continues to affect our lives. 

MS Society – Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic, typically progressive disease involving damage to the sheaths of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. This charity funds research, gives grants, campaigns for change, provides information and support, invests in MS specialists and lends a listening ear to anyone affected by MS. - http://www.mssociety.org.uk/

Some Details

Note: attendance is not required. This event is just to raise money for some very worthwhile causes! 
It is important to emphasise that this is not one of those ‘pay for our holiday’ trips. We are paying for the cycling trip. EVERY PENNY YOU DONATE GOES STRAIGHT TO THE CHARITIES.
Since all of these charities are based outside of the US, you can make your donations in US dollars through this IndieGoGo website and thereafter I'll take care of the hassle of converting the money and making sure it gets to the right place.

</h3><p>It has been very difficult trying to figure out how much I will need to make this happen. I know that to build such a site will need full time coders/designers, which means an office and computers and equipment. It will be a business and will need to be able to grow quickly to stand any chance of working so there needs to be some money there for flexibility. I have studied business and have no worries about how to handle it, I've just never taken on such a big project before so am trying to be conservative in my estimations.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/975917/files/20141031170658-Professional_Developers_at_CollegeCoders.png?1414800418"" src="""" style=""width: 133.178px; height: 114px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/975919/files/20141031170723-Professional_Developers_at_CollegeCoders.png?1414800443"" src="""" style=""width: 135.496px; height: 116px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/975921/files/20141031170757-Professional_Developers_at_CollegeCoders.png?1414800477"" src="""" style=""width: 137.667px; height: 118px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/975923/files/20141031170834-Professional_Developers_at_CollegeCoders.png?1414800514"" src="""" style=""width: 136.682px; height: 117px;""/></p>I am guessing at least 2 coders and 2 designers and therefore 4 computers, all the extra equipment that goes with that, and a big enough office.

That figure stands at 10% and I have personally stumped up the money myself out of my back up funds for my film making career, so it is reasonable to hope that I fund enough to at least cover the cost, or I will not only have given up 120 days of my life and untold efforts through pain and suffering, but I will also have lost £3000+... However, that being said, the amount I take back will totally depend on how much is raised. If I reach any amount that can cover having at least a basic version built that I can build on, then I will just take the hit. If it is more like the full amount, then I will recover my costs. If however I raise less than £3000, then again, I will recover my costs. As in all investments of this kind, I can't make those decisions until the end but needless to say, if I am investing 120 days, everything I have in the way of physical, emotional and psychological strength, and £3000+ of my back up career funds, then £3-5 from anyone else is not really something to worry about is it!?<br/></p><p>Now, please be aware that I am fully aware of how conservative that sounds, to the point of almost sounding naive from a business point of view, but that is for a reason. If I was to go call out all the things that I would possibly need to really make this a success, I would end up with a list longer than everything I have written so far, and a budget of several hundred thousand, but that would be ridiculous. <br/></p><p>As a result, what I have done is aim as low as possible so that the only real difference between what I have accounted for and a successful end product, is the hard work in between. The reason being is that I know how capable I am of that hard work. That being said, everyone would choose the best case scenario if asked, and I was to do so, the list and target amount would both increase quite a bit and that is why I really, really hope the project overfunds!<br/></p><p>It will probably take, at the absolute least, 3 months to get a beta version ready with only 4 people. That's 5 sets of wages and costs, 2 or three times before the site could even think of going live. Due to the fact that the professionals and local businesses will get all the cheap advertising from it, they will be charged small amounts for having profiles which is how the site will sustain it's self once it's launched.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/975931/files/20141031171408-OFG-cover-3d.png?1414800848"" src="""" style=""width: 238.264px; height: 302px;""/></p>So, I had to add all that up and come up with a figure. Now obviously, the higher the figure, the far better chance the site has of starting successfully and quickly, but given that the whole point of the site is to provide an infrastructure where people can help each other by donating time, I feel bad enough having to ask for money to get it started as it is, let alone ask for loads.<br/><br/>Therefore, all things taken in to account, I am going with the amount of £30,000. I have chosen the 'take whatever is raised' option because even if it is only £10,000 raised, it's only a website so I'll just have to try to do it with one or two people, which will take a lot, lot longer and will be a lot, lot harder to achieve, but will still be possible, I hope! Basically, the amount of money raised is going to directly effect how quickly, and how well the site can be built and launched and start helping people help each other. <br/><br/>It's a very awkward feeling when you decide to give up 120 days of your life and walk 1200 miles, even trying it barefoot, to prove how much you want to help people, but then you have to actually ask for money to build the site so all I can say is sorry for having to ask and please forgive me if you think what I am asking for is too much! :/<br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/975940/files/20141031171917-karma.png?1414801157"" src="""" style=""width: 332px; height: 332px;""/></p><br/><b>Karma points.</b><br/>In an attempt to reward people as we go, the site will have 'karma points' which will be displayed in the social media format profiles of each member. People you work with on projects will be able to award you karma points based on how hard working, kind, helpful you were etc. The more you help the community, the more they will reward you with karma points. <br/><br/>Local businesses will then be encouraged to trade karma points with people for small bonuses like 20% off your next shop, or a free cocktail when you go to the bar etc. We, as a site, will also hope to reward those with much bigger amounts of karma points, with much bigger rewards, but obviously it's not a good idea to start saying what they might be right now!<br/><br/>So, even if you want to just be part of a new social media site that allows you to help others and just become a karma farmer for you own personal gain, I don't care, because then everyone's a winner!<br/><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help.</h3><p>I have been thinking long and hard about how best to help 'market' the project, and in the end I came up with the idea of having a Facebook page, but then setting up an 120 day long 'event.' That way I can make it totally open to the public and invite as many people as possible. Anyone will be able to invite anyone to the 'event.' <br/></p><p>This way, I will be able to keep constant updates posted to the event and everyone will get notified about them. I will also run a Twitter profile and Instagram for all the awesome pictures I am going to be able to take. I think, all things considered, this is probably the best chance I have of keeping everyone involved from day one. This is a project for the community as a whole, world wide, and so I would love for people to be fully involved from day one, and this is the best way I could think of!</p><p>For now I think this should be the end of the massive essay that is my 'project outline' homepage.

Now obviously, the higher the figure, the far better chance the site has of starting successfully and quickly, but given that the whole point of the site is to provide an infrastructure where people can help each other by donating time, I feel bad enough having to ask for money to get it started as it is, let alone ask for loads.Therefore, all things taken in to account, I am going with the amount of £30,000. I have chosen the 'take whatever is raised' option because even if it is only £10,000 raised, it's only a website so I'll just have to try to do it with one or two people, which will take a lot, lot longer and will be a lot, lot harder to achieve, but will still be possible, I hope! Basically, the amount of money raised is going to directly effect how quickly, and how well the site can be built and launched and start helping people help each other. It's a very awkward feeling when you decide to give up 120 days of your life and walk 1200 miles, even trying it barefoot, to prove how much you want to help people, but then you have to actually ask for money to build the site so all I can say is sorry for having to ask and please forgive me if you think what I am asking for is too much! :/Karma points.In an attempt to reward people as we go, the site will have 'karma points' which will be displayed in the social media format profiles of each member. People you work with on projects will be able to award you karma points based on how hard working, kind, helpful you were etc. The more you help the community, the more they will reward you with karma points. Local businesses will then be encouraged to trade karma points with people for small bonuses like 20% off your next shop, or a free cocktail when you go to the bar etc. We, as a site, will also hope to reward those with much bigger amounts of karma points, with much bigger rewards, but obviously it's not a good idea to start saying what they might be right now!So, even if you want to just be part of a new social media site that allows you to help others and just become a karma farmer for you own personal gain, I don't care, because then everyone's a winner!Other Ways You Can Help.I have been thinking long and hard about how best to help 'market' the project, and in the end I came up with the idea of having a Facebook page, but then setting up an 120 day long 'event.' That way I can make it totally open to the public and invite as many people as possible. Anyone will be able to invite anyone to the 'event.' This way, I will be able to keep constant updates posted to the event and everyone will get notified about them. I will also run a Twitter profile and Instagram for all the awesome pictures I am going to be able to take. I think, all things considered, this is probably the best chance I have of keeping everyone involved from day one. This is a project for the community as a whole, world wide, and so I would love for people to be fully involved from day one, and this is the best way I could think of!For now I think this should be the end of the massive essay that is my 'project outline' homepage.

<h3>My name is Wendy and I am here to campaign for my oldest sister Barbara Clements. She has recently lost her vision due to Diabetes. My sister has spent a good deal of her life building this business, to help educate the world and those in it. Much of her life has been devoted to teaching and training individuals and companies in Trade Compliance. She has always been a giver and never a taker. She is passionate about what she does and her business is her life. Please keep her from being another statistic.</h3>
<p>Her diabetes has taken its toll on her and she has lost her sight. She has had to overcome and adapt to so many things in her life. She has struggled through it all. Some people may believe that Barbara's blindness has greatly inhibited her extraordinary professionalism, vast knowledge, skills and abilities to teach our small-to-medium businesses in Trade Compliance.  They are wrong.  Barbara's brain still works at the same rapid pace.  Barbara has never given up on anything in her life. She is fighting to keep her business going until she has fully adapted to this disability. She will overcome. Her global reputation in Trade Compliance is second-to-none.  Her website is: <a href=""http://www.barbclementsassociates.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.barbclementsassociates.com</a></p>
<p>In order for her to catch up and keep her business from failing she needs at least $70K.  This will help to cover Barbara’s expenses since her vision began to fail and through many surgeries in the past several months.  It will help with her business overheads so she can continue to run her business of helping small-to-medium businesses in the complex arena of Trade Compliance while learning how to use Braille and work with a Guide Dog.</p>
<p>I and many others have always relied on Barbara, and she has never asked for a thing in return. She has educated so many and asked for little or nothing in return. Her business makes a difference in the world – particularly to our small-to-medium businesses. Her skills are boundless. The contribution she has made to Trade Compliance is phenomenal. Now, she needs help.</p>
</div>
<p>Her business is her life, she would be crushed without it. Please help me to help her from becoming another statistic.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading this and for whatever you can do to help. The goal I have set is only for $70K, this is the absolute minimum that she needs to make it. So, once again, thank you for your help and support.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
Zucano focuses on making everyday traveling more enjoyable by turning it into a social experience. Many of us spend long hours sitting in an airplane, riding the subway to work, or taking a ferry to join our favorite vacation destination. Zucano wants to turn this usually boring and uneventful experience into an opportunity to meet new people, catch up with old friends, and learn something new. The concept was developed by a group of young entrepreneurs that spent many hours on the road and were looking for a way to make it more entertaining and rewarding.
 Zucano is a way of living. It's about traveling with an open mind. It's about making new friends. It's about learning new things. Zucano is about making your journey more rewarding regardless of the destination.
 

Philosophy

Zucano philosphy perfectly summarized by Snoopy!
 
Kudos to Snoopy and his visionary creator, Charles Schultz, for summarizing things so well for us. Oddly enough, this cartoon was left on a chair during our travels in a subway in Milan... Commuting can really be an inspirational experience!
  

The problem!
Have you ever needed to adopt tricks like this to travel more confortably? 

Lammar Wilson on How to avoid strangers while traveling BEFORE Zucano! (link to Youtube Video) 
 
How does Zucano work?
 

 

What we are looking for
Zucano is a community of people that wants to travel with an open mind. Zucano is for someone looking for more than just choosing between an aisle or window seat. Networking is key!
Spreading the word amongst the friends is not enough to ensure the most satisfactory social travel experience possible; First, travelers need to be able to meet new people, speak about a common friends; then ensure enough contacts in your circle to filter ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ out bad travel buddies and end up with the best possible crew of friends! Zucano allows you to do this in just seconds, giving you more time to tan on your trip!
This is basically why we are asking you to initiate our marketing effort and make Zucano go viral!
 
 
Adopt a route and be its ambassador!
 
1. HIGH-FIVE SUPPORTEvery dollar counts! You love the project, but don't want to commit more than $5. As a backer, you'll receive all update and you'll contribute to make this project a reality. To show our thanks we will include you in the supporters' page so everyone will know ￼￼￼￼￼￼of your generosity!
 
2. ADOPT A ROUTE (AaR) As a reward for those who’ll decide to support our cause for more than $5 and as sign of our extreme gratitude, we will dedicate national or international routes of every transportation means we are able to support. So when people will start looking for NYC - Paris routes, your name will show up as the ambassador or adopter of that route.You can link your name on the route, to your personal blog or website (non commercial + no social network pages).

Perks: route dedicated to a user
 
In addition, supporting Zucano ensures that we will maintain your route for the next year; normally, if you register a route, you’ll need to introduce 25 travelers or guarantee a certain amount of travels on that route to be sure that it will be maintained for a year.PLUS, you’ll get to be the first Captain of the route: this is generally a reward for the most frequent traveler of the ruote, but you’ll get for free for the first 3 months!

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">However, our stretch goal is to build a more versatile prototype (version 3.0). This is a much bigger engineering challenge. Building a system that can be easily adjusted to enable a wider variety of sailors with different physical limitations also costs much more than simply replicating the work already done. While designing version 3.0 is a greater engineering challenge, we believe the team's combined experience gives us the data we need to reduce the associated risks</span><br/></p>
<p>While we are prepared to do the hard work necessary to build version 3.0, it's hard to predict unforeseen factors we might encounter along the way. There is a risk that the final product may not have all the versatility we are striving for in our current plan, and that not everything will go according to our expected timeline. </p>
<p>Regardless, we know we have the basis for an improved prototype that will move us closer to our ultimate goal and we're ready to take on this new challenge. When we have our launch party in 2015, we're confident we'll be one step closer to our goal. For us, the size of the step matters less than the progress forward.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.community-boating.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Community Boating's non-profit mission</a> is to provide sailing that is accessible for all. We're very passionate about it. This means reducing ALL barriers including physical, social and economic ones. Our UAP members (and our junior sailors) pay what they can based on their economic circumstances. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Because we understand the challenges that they may face, we are committed to providing access. We work hard to find creative ways to fund our programs. We never want to deny any member access to the water for any reason. </span></p>
<p>To support our mission, we have a scholarship program that allows economically challenged <a href=""http://www.community-boating.org/programs/junior-program/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Junior Program sailors</a> to sail for a whole summer for just $1. We are always on the lookout for new ways to increase funding for this program. We currently serve about 2,000 children during our summer sailing season so there is always a financial need. </p>
<p>In addition, we have developed a wide array of STEM programs that run in conjunction with corporate and educational partners like Google, MIT and others that create STEM learning programs tied to sailing. Since sailing incorporates physics, math, water science and engineering, this is a natural fit. We explore innovative ways to expand this work through active partnerships with cool people doing cool things in these fields and engaged funders who appreciate our mission.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">   </span></p>

</div></div>","THANK YOU FOR HELPING US REACH OUR GOAL!!!! We are SO excited to soon be developing advanced technology to enable individuals with limited mobility to become the skipper of their own boats!


Community Boating, Inc. (CBI) is a 501(c)3 non-profit. We are the nation's oldest public sailing center
located in the heart of Boston's beautiful Back Bay. Our mission is the
advancement of #Sailing4All by minimizing economic and physical
obstacles to sailing. We currently serve over 2,000 children, 4,000 adults and 300 UAP sailors a year. 



In 2007, we launched our Universal Access Program (UAP), enabling members with disabilities new opportunities
to get on the water and experience the joys of sailing. In the UAP, persons with special needs and their guests have use of specialized, accessible sailboats and transfer equipment, dedicated staff assistance, and sailing instruction. Reserved one-on-one sessions are customized to meet individual needs. Here's a picture of version 1.0 of our steering/chair system on the right.

     
Watch the video below to learn more about the technology for accessible sailing at Community Boating:

The program has been amazingly successful. Last
spring, we had an article published about our program in Palaestra.  While we've had great success so far; given how much we've learned, the strength of our team and the advances in engineering and material science, we know we are ready to supercharge and upgrade our program to the next level. We found the perfect project partners to help us: Richard Ramos and Aleef Mahmud. 

                     

Watch the video below to learn more about our partners, Richard Ramos and Aleef Mahmud, and their story:
Richard is a long-time CBI UAP sailor and a competitive racer mounting a campaign to qualify for the Paralympics. Aleef is a talented engineer from RIT who now lives in Boston. Working together, along with the rest of the Community Boating staff and amazing volunteers, we believe we have assembled the perfect team to build something amazing.



Our S-T-R-E-T-C-H goal is
to enable anyone, regardless of their disability, to get out on the water and
become part of the sailing community. We're aiming high. Ultimately, we want to build systems that we can share with adaptive sports programs worldwide. We have the expertise, the experience, the
facility and the team – now we need your support to help us raise funds and spread the word so we can make it a reality!
   What We Need -- Our #Cheers4Chairs GOAL
$30K = one steering/chair system much like Richard's, we're calling it version 2.2, so our accessible sailing program achieves even more versatility than our current steering/chair design (version 1.0) can provide. 




This high-tech steering/chair system (version 2.0) belongs to Richard and he's kind enough to let CBI borrow it from time to time. This campaign covers the cost of a new version of Richard's chair (version 2.2) with some simple modifications. Community Boating would own this system and install in a boat for our UAP members to use any time.



$30K = one steering/chair system (Version 2.2) for one Community Boating UAP boat.
Here's a hint: We have ambitious goals because of our passion for this project. Truth be told, we want to go as high as possible - so in addition to our $30,000 goal, we've set pretty big S-T-R-E-T-C-H goals for ourselves.  We'll tell you about those later, if we are lucky enough to exceed our initial goal.....WINK, WINK. WINK...HINT, HINT, HINT - Help us get to the very TOP!

                            




What You Get -- #Cheers4Chairs Perks






The Impact
Today, more people with disabilities are taking part in physically demanding sports like sailing. But the equipment has a long way to go and people who want to compete are actively seeking innovative technology solutions. Richard and Aleef's prototype is one of a small handful of solutions worldwide. 


We have dreams of joining other like-minded people to create a global movement that empowers disabled individuals to get moving, socialize and participate in welcoming, inclusive communities. 
While we're focused on thinking of this technology's applicability for sailing, the reality is these designs will have broader implications for other sports as well. Our technology could be applied far beyond sailing to other physical activities.
We have the expertise and the experience. We certainly have the passion and we have a technical solution that is proven and in demand. We've already gotten calls from as far away as Israel as the word gets out about version 2.0. We want to actively share our experiences with versions 1.0 and 2.0 so people with disabilities don't have to work so hard to find them.

  Risks & Challenges We already have a working prototype that we can readily replicate. However, our stretch goals are all about raising the funds necessary to redesign and upgrade the current steering/chair system. 
The existing prototype, version 2.0, is completely customized for one person, Richard Ramos. Replicating this system will give Community Boating's UAP members with similar body types an entirely new sailing experience - much richer.... more lively and highly interactive. We are excited about that possibility.



However, our stretch goal is to build a more versatile prototype (version 3.0). This is a much bigger engineering challenge. Building a system that can be easily adjusted to enable a wider variety of sailors with different physical limitations also costs much more than simply replicating the work already done. While designing version 3.0 is a greater engineering challenge, we believe the team's combined experience gives us the data we need to reduce the associated risks
While we are prepared to do the hard work necessary to build version 3.0, it's hard to predict unforeseen factors we might encounter along the way. There is a risk that the final product may not have all the versatility we are striving for in our current plan, and that not everything will go according to our expected timeline. 
Regardless, we know we have the basis for an improved prototype that will move us closer to our ultimate goal and we're ready to take on this new challenge. When we have our launch party in 2015, we're confident we'll be one step closer to our goal. For us, the size of the step matters less than the progress forward.

The mission of our center is based on the idea that the world can only heal once we have healed ourselves. The healing services we provide enable our Human Beings to heal themselves - whether it is from our food made with love and concern for all beings, our compassionate and healing hearts and hands, or our events that are so filled with creativity, good feelings, community, and love that the body can’t help but feel good.
We turn no one away for monetary reasons. 
Dr. Bob has been giving to the Golden Gate Community for over 15 years and has been a healer for over 35 years. Dr. Bob is partnering with Tom ""Spiraling Fox"" LaBonty from  www.Massage4.us and aBodys Massage. Tom has been a Massage Therapist and Healer for nearly 20 years and an Entrepreneur for 35 years. In addition, he is a Chef and has culinary training with Chef Kevin Enright and from OCC College.

  What Your Funding Will Provide For Detroit Food is the Body's Medicine. Help us buy, grow and store fresh produce for the Veggy Table Cafe and the Palmer Park/Golden Gate neighborhood! 
We need to custom build a walk-in cooler in the basement to keep fresh high quality organic produce. We will be able to support local urban farms like Pingree Farms and Robin-Hood Urban Farm, and purchase in case load quantities. This will allow us to provide healthy food choices in the Golden Gate neighborhood by having produce for sale at the Woodward Avenue Organic and Farm Grown Vegetable Stand, and a ""U Buy We Stir Fry"" program at the Veggy Table Cafe!
We are excited to be in the process of being able to accept EBT Food Stamps. We will be working in cooperation with Detroit's Eastern Market to provide fresh produce to all.


Over the winter, build the walk-in cooler: custom build insulated walls, floor, ceiling, and cooling unit. 

Over the winter, purchase a used commercial 6 burner stove and oven for the Veggy Table Cafe.

For spring 2015, build the Woodward Avenue Organic and Farm Grown Vegetable Stand.

For spring 2015, install a new sign for the Veggy Table Cafe.

For summer 2015, expand urban farming: extend Dr. Bob's farm; assist the Robin-hood Urban Farm project on Robinwood Street and Woodward Avenue. 
  The Impact It's hard to measure the impact Dr. Bob and Tom have had on the lives around them. The improvements will expand the reach of the healing center in the community: 


Having healthy food easily available will improve health by having options other than processed foods at gas stations and convenience stores.
We will be able to serve our community healthy food more efficiently and more cost effectively.
The Woodward Avenue Organic and Farm Grown Vegetable Stand and the expansion of urban farming right on Woodward Ave will be highly visible and create conversation around sustainability.
This is the first step of many in expanding and improving this community, and the vision we have for Wellness Village Detroit.

We are women that serve women. 


Start From Seed (SFS) is a non-profit organization that empowers and strengthens families during the childbearing year by providing comprehensive doula services and childbirth education, regardless of income level.





We have been been helping families have more healthier, more satisfying births since 2011.


Our team is made up of dedicated, caring women who come from diverse backgrounds and skill sets. Our Program supports women living below the poverty level and have complex health conditions proven to adversely affect maternal and child outcomes. Volunteer support is also offered to women that face language barriers, substance abuse, physical/sexual abuse, and teen pregnancy. SFS receives referrals from many wonderful community health organizations in Buncombe County, NC. 



We have built this campaign to help raise the funds needed for a year's worth of rent in a new office space. We currently use our office space for childbirth education classes, breastfeeding classes, doula trainings, and prenatal meetings with doula clients. There is something happening in the office almost every day. The building we are in now does not have adequate heat in the winter, lights don't get replaced in stairwells or parking lot, elevator breaks often... you get the idea. With your contributions to our campaign you are directly keeping this program going. We do not receive grant funding at this time, so every little bit donated goes a LONG way for us. By contributing, you are directly strengthening the fabric of our communities. One family at a time. 


Why doulas and childbirth education are SO important to the women we serve:


28% decrease in the risk of cesarean section
31% decrease in the use of pitocin
14% decrease in the risk of having a newborn admitted to special care nursery
Overall increase in satisfaction with her birth experience
Increased breastfeeding initiation rates
Increase confidence in parenting
Decrease in postpartum mood disorders

The women we serve may be:


Residents of homeless and/or domestic abuse shelters
Teen mothers
Women in residential substance abuse programs
Immigrants and/or non-English speaking mothers
Women receiving pregnancy Medicaid and WIC services
Disabled or intellectually impaired
Women recently released from prison


WE NEED YOU!
We are raising $10,500 for this campaign. Where your money goes:

Rent for one year on a new classroom/office space off Merrimon Ave. The space is roughly 500 sq ft, humble, and very yellow (at the moment). It was a hair salon for the past 47 years. 
New flooring due to water damage from the beauty salon sinks
Building a tiny, tiny kitchen that will be a short counter top and small sink.
Paint and painting materials
Getting utilities turned on

Oh! There is a precious window box out front, so we will probably buy some plants


The perks include some awesome SFS ""EVERY FAMILY COUNTS"" merchandise. We have canvas tote bags, American Apparel T-shirts, buttons, pens, doula services, cupcakes... take a look. Here are what some of our clients have to say about us:""What a great service
you all provide to mothers and fathers...without it I probably would not have
had a doula. I can not imagine my birth without
Luci! She was such a great support for my husband and I. Thanks for everything Luci and
SFS!""""Just
wanted to let you know that I was so, so very happy to be matched with Gloria
Maria. She provided so much emotional, physical, spiritual and educational
support to me during my four days at Mission last week. And although I'd been
hoping to avoid an induction, she helped me get to the mental space I needed to
reach to let go and trust the process...and in the end have the water birth I'd
dreamed of. I see now why having a doula is so very valuable. And now we have a
beautiful, feisty baby girl. Thank you for all you do!""""Loved our childbirth education classes with Allison. Third time 'round and I still felt we learned so much! We also made a great friend in a new doula. I would highly recommend any services backed by Start From Seed!""The nitty gritty --->

<p>Hello, and thank you for visiting our philanthropic effort site for the Pediatric Services of JFK Medical Center.  Our need is very much ever present, and we appreciate you taking the time to consider donating to this very worthy cause.</p>
<p>It's an exciting time here at JFK Medical Center.  Our Pediatric department is preparing for a year full of new beginnings, and we are already on track towards a year of extraordinary progress.</p>
<p>We are breaking new ground, renovating our facility to enhance our patient care.  Our new Maternal and Child unit is scheduled for renovations and technological upgrades in 2014.  The new unit will provide the children, newborns and their mothers a state of the art facility with access to a conducive environment for the families.  </p>
<p>Looking ahead, we are focused on creating an environment that embodies a philosophy of not just treating Pediatric patients, but treating each individual child.</p>
<p>Your support will surely help us to accelerate and expand our scope of care in the areas of neonatal, emergency and neurological care for children with various disorders through your generous donations.</p>
<p>Thanks to your support, our caregivers have touched the lives of thousands of children - whether they faced an urgent need, a devastating disease or sought to improve their quality of life.</p>

<h3>Who I am...</h3>
<p>I've been a knitter for over 40 years.  I love knitting, and all things knit.  Most people would say it is absolutely my passion.  I share that passion by knitting for friends and family, enjoying the company of other knitters at a weekly knitting and crocheting group and teaching knitting classes.  I wanted to be able to do more.  </p>
<p>For the past month I've been knitting feverishly for my, soon to arrive, great nephew.  I realized as I knit, that just as I had when I knit for my own babies, I was trying to infuse each stitch with love.  I think that is common for knitters and crocheters.  I wanted to find a way to share that love with children who needed it the most.</p>
<p>It struck me that the knitting and crocheting community is not only enormous, but also incredibly loving and giving.</p>
<h3>
<strong>What I Want to Do...</strong> </h3>
<p>I came up with the idea of knitting and crocheting hats for pre-schoolers.  I thought, how cool would it be for 2-4 year olds to be able to pick a hand made, creative hat?  I wanted to do it!</p>
<p>What I want to do is simple.  I want to partner with our local Head Start program and make sure every pre-schooler has a new hat for next winter.  I wanted each hat to be as unique as its recipient.</p>
<p>I know I can come up with the knitters and crocheters, we're all about giving back.  I also know that sometimes the people that want to give are strapped by economic constraints.  I wanted to be able to give everyone the opportunity to share their love and creativity.  If I can provide yarn to every one that wants to contribute and can't, because of economic diffiulties, this would be a huge success.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get....</h3>
<p>We need $2,500.00 to be able to purchase yarn and ship it to interested knitters/crocheters.  Although, many knitters and crocheters will have a ""stash"" from which to produce hats, for others the cost of yarn will be a hindrance to their participation.  Our ability to provide the yarn will help make this a success.</p>
<p>Every donor will recieve a very heart felt thank you!  Each hat created with your donation will have your name, city and state/country on the hang tag, as well as the volunteer knitter/crocheter's name.</p>
<p>Some of the other perks include stickers, magnets, and a special shout out on our ""Knit Wit"" board!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, perhaps we won't be able to provide the number of hats we want to.  However it works out, we will still run our program, I just hate the idea that not all of the children will receive hats.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact...</h3>
<p>How wonderful is it to know that this coming winter you will have been the person that gave a new, unique hat to a pre-schooler? We will definitely post pictures of the hats, and some of the recipients on our website and Facebook page.  </p>
<p>In the past I've knit hats for preemies and for chemo patients.  I have always felt these are important causes and have loved contributing.  I wanted something a little different, a group that hasn't had the opportunity to feel the ""love"" of a new, handmade hat.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help....</h3>
<p>I know that not everyone is in a position to contribute monetarily, so if you would like to contribute, become one of our knitters/crocheters.  If you're interested in donating hats you've made, they must be new, made from acrylic yarn, and machine washable. The only limitation is your imagination!</p>
<p>All that we ask is that you get the word out.  Help us make this campaign a success!  Tell your friends, family, coworkers, well, just everyone!  Indiegogo makes spreading the word easy, just use the share tools!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time and support.</p>

Once we are totally up to speed, we will be the home of up to 300 start-up businesses, creative freelancers, and entrepreneurs. </p><p>Coworking spaces are not just places to work – they are hubs of collaboration, where brilliant people from similar and diverse backgrounds come together to share ideas, inspire, and feed of each other’s energy. </p><p>Out of the up-and-coming individuals and companies that are a part of Workhaus, some are going to move on to do big things – HUGE things! It’s going to happen, and we will be the loudest cheerleaders out there, proud to think that maybe we had just an inkling to do with their success.</p><br/><p></p><h3>Where is WORKHAUS?</h3>We occupy the entire top floor of a wonderful heritage brick and beam building in the heart of downtown Toronto.<p></p><p></p><ul>

<p></p> <div> <h3>Why Crowdfunding?</h3>
<div>
<p>We have a goal at WORKHAUS – to make things as easy and as comfortable for our members by offering innovative services and amenities. The way we see it, if we take care of the small stuff, you don’t have to. The better we make you look, the better we look. We are all set for a November 2014 launch, and already have in place some great perks, but we are crowdfunding now to raise funds so that we can do the AMAZING things that go above and beyond, and enhance our members’ experience.</p>
<p>We are also crowdfunding to get the word out about WORKHAUS, and we are offering some pretty great incentives for those who want to jump on the train early on! For those in the Toronto area, there are some great discounts on space for monthly rentals, short trial packages to try us out, and even sponsor packages. For those not local to Toronto there still are some great perks, but if you do contribute and can’t really use our services, we will be super grateful and if you ever do make it out to Toronto, we’ll take you out for a night out you probably won’t remember!<br/></p>

</div>You may look at our incentives offered and think, “that’s not for me!” You may have no use for our services, and although you’d like to help us out because we’re a swell bunch, it doesn’t make financial sense for you to contribute to our fund. We get it. You feel bad that you can’t help out because you are likewise a swell person, but please don’t feel bad! You can absolutely help us out by spreading the word throughout your networks, because, well, who knows. And you know what? We will be just as grateful to you for spreading the word, so thank you!</div>","What is WORKHAUS?WORKHAUS is Toronto’s newest coworking space, opening November 2014. Once we are totally up to speed, we will be the home of up to 300 start-up businesses, creative freelancers, and entrepreneurs. Coworking spaces are not just places to work – they are hubs of collaboration, where brilliant people from similar and diverse backgrounds come together to share ideas, inspire, and feed of each other’s energy. Out of the up-and-coming individuals and companies that are a part of Workhaus, some are going to move on to do big things – HUGE things! It’s going to happen, and we will be the loudest cheerleaders out there, proud to think that maybe we had just an inkling to do with their success.Where is WORKHAUS?We occupy the entire top floor of a wonderful heritage brick and beam building in the heart of downtown Toronto.

Across the street from the world-famous St. Lawrence Market


A short walk from King Station, and


Just meters from the nearest streetcar stop

Address: 100 Front St E, 4th floor, Toronto, ON, M5A 1E1, Canadawww.workhausoffice.comWhy do we want to open WORKHAUS?Our m/o is not just to stick a bunch of people in a room and hope for the best. We will be there, fostering relationships, providing ample opportunities for networking, throwing parties, and implementing programs to keep people accountable to their goals – building an awesome community! We have a big, bright, awesome location right across from the St. Lawrence Market. We’ve built a place that looks great and feels right. We are literally steps from transit, fast food, fresh food, great pubs, and coffee – but you don’t need to buy coffee, we’ve got you covered for free, 24/7.
  Why Crowdfunding?

We have a goal at WORKHAUS – to make things as easy and as comfortable for our members by offering innovative services and amenities. The way we see it, if we take care of the small stuff, you don’t have to. The better we make you look, the better we look. We are all set for a November 2014 launch, and already have in place some great perks, but we are crowdfunding now to raise funds so that we can do the AMAZING things that go above and beyond, and enhance our members’ experience.
We are also crowdfunding to get the word out about WORKHAUS, and we are offering some pretty great incentives for those who want to jump on the train early on! For those in the Toronto area, there are some great discounts on space for monthly rentals, short trial packages to try us out, and even sponsor packages. For those not local to Toronto there still are some great perks, but if you do contribute and can’t really use our services, we will be super grateful and if you ever do make it out to Toronto, we’ll take you out for a night out you probably won’t remember!


How will the funds be allocated?Funds raised in this campaign will be earmarked for three main initiatives:


1) UPGRADE THE TELECOM SYSTEM -- We will invest in a robust teleconferencing infrastructure to ensure that our members have access to the best conferencing systems available so they are represented exquisitely when dealing with remote clients. 
2) A VIDEO AND PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO -- We will build in a collapsible mobile professional studio. It will be used for things like clients'  social media videos, headshots, product shoots, fashion shoots etc. 
3) FASHION INCUBATOR -- We will purchase equipment and materials (including sewing machines, sergers, drafting tables, computers) to launch our fashion incubator within WORKHAUS, where we will accept several great up-and-coming designers into a program so unique it is unheard of! (But let's keep it a secret between us, friends, for now.)
4) STRETCH GOAL -- if we exceed our funding goal, we will use the funds to upgrade and improve the facility to provide even more comfort and amenities for our members.

Operational hiccups - growing pains. We expect to go through all the challenges attributed to starting a new business. But we are confident that the team we've assembled is able to overcome these as they arise.

Construction delays. Construction is currently at 95%. We have made huge progress since we shot the video. There are small touchups left here and there and we are tirelessly working around the clock to be open-ready and have a soft opening on October 21.

When we approached the owner of our building to renew our sales contract and our lease, she declined and put the property on the market at a price of $1,100,000. We made an offer and settled at $980,000 with a closing date of September 10th.  We immediately sought financing to complete the purchase, however, since we are a relatively new business, our revenue history does not meet the criteria for traditional bank financing.  The owner of the building has other interested buyers who are likely to develop the property as apartments with retail space on the ground floor.<br/><br/>In order for us to continue with the Central Hotel project we need to raise funds and find partners to complete the purchase of the building now. We will be launching a campaign in the next week and asking for your help telling our story and spreading the word about our current need for support. As much as we want our project to succeed, as a member of the community we do business in, we do not want to see another residential and storefront development that is likely unaffordable for local owned businesses and residents. This is a critical opportunity to retain a piece of the community we love as growth and development march on around us.

restaurant on the main floor, a 4th floor lounge and a roof top deck and
 event space. The closest hotel and lodging is 4 miles from this 
location. The hotel will provide much needed services to the local area 
including the University of Portland, the Port District, cyclists, 
hikers, bird watchers, and local residents. Cathedral Park is becoming 
one of the most sought out wedding locations in Portland. The hotel will
 be able to serve all of these needs. <br/>This project was started

<h3>Join us in helping those in need this holiday season!</h3>
<p>On any given day, 170 homeless people are depending on Ocean Park Community Center (OPCC) for temporary shelter, case management and 3 hot meals. That's 3,570 meals a week. And thanks to the generosity of many in-kind donors and volunteer groups, OPCC is able to really stretch their food budget. They only have to spend $2,104 a week to provide a nutritious meal for each resident, 3 times a day.</p>
<h3>So, we've decided to help them out this holiday season and sponsor an entire week, 3,570 FULL PLATES, for those served by OPCC.</h3>
<p>By providing a basic need, like hot meals, we are helping OPCC's clients to focus on their many other challenges, like chronic physical conditions, substance addiction, and mental illness.  Therefore, the larger benefit of these FULL PLATES isn't just satisfied hunger, it is the freedom we provide to these folks to truly transform their lives.</p>

During this time she was separated from her parents and her brothers. Oceania dealt with feelings of abandonment and low self-esteem that eventually caused behavioral issues.

I'm a graduate of Florida A&amp;M University (FAMU) currently pursuing an MBA with a focus in Entrepreneurship at Georgia State University where I am set to graduate this December. I currently work in payroll &amp; HR sales and thus work with several business owners. Previously, I was a bank branch manager and small business lender, so I have supported and built relationships with all types of small businesses over the years. I have always been passionate about entrepreneurship and have always had a desire to operate my own business. I feel that everything I've done education and career-wise has helped to prepare me for this endeavor. </p>
<p><b>Your contribution will help me achieve a life-long dream.</b> </p>
<p>With the funds raised, I will be able to open the first Tropical Smoothie Cafe in Cobb county and other future locations throughout the Atlanta area.</p>
<h3 style=""letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Why Tropical Smoothie</h3>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;"">I chose Tropical Smoothie because of the surge in interest in the health food &amp; nutrition industry. Tropical Smoothie Cafe has delicious and nutritious offerings for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Options include fresh fruit smoothies, sandwiches, flatbreads, wraps, salads, and sides that include fruit, chips, granola, and trail mix. </p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;"">Tropical Smoothie is a franchise that has already proven to have a successful concept and thrives in its current markets. (Google reviews and see for yourself!)  Right now, they are looking to break into the Atlanta market and duplicate the success they have in other cities and I want the opportunity to be a part of this venture.</p>
<h3>
<span style="""">Why I Will Be Successful </span><br/>
</h3>
</div><div><span style="""">I am both thankful and humbled to have a great support network composed of friends, family, and fellow alumnus from FAMU and Georgia State. Additionally, my father, a retired veteran of the US ARMY, has agreed to go in on this business venture with me. With his support and status, we can take advantage of several benefits awarded to veterans. For example, we plan to pursue catering contracts locally and on the nearby military base (Dobbins AFB) where they honor Veterans First. Veterans First is a program where businesses and government entities alike give consideration to military veterans first when bidding on service contracts which gives us a great advantage.</span></div><div><span style="""">Additionally, I have lots of ideas for community involvement and programs such as health and wellness events, local sponsorships, scholarships, etc. We also have ideas to differentiate product offerings once we build more rapport with the franchise. </span></div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What's in it for You</h3> <p>The Breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to receive funding, I need to bring a minimum of $20,000 cash to the table. The $10,000 that I am hoping to raise with your support will help me make up for my current shortfall.</li> <li>In the event that I don't raise the full $10,000 within the 60-day period, I will continue to save until I do and then pursue an SBA loan to fund the build out, marketing and initial start-up costs; so no matter what, any and all contributions will go towards this project.</li>
<li>Everyone who contributes in any way, shape or form will be invited to the Grand Opening and will receive their first smoothie or food item for FREE as a Thank You for your support.</li>

</div></div>","Summary Hello, I'm Shaletha Litt. I'm a graduate of Florida A&M University (FAMU) currently pursuing an MBA with a focus in Entrepreneurship at Georgia State University where I am set to graduate this December. I currently work in payroll & HR sales and thus work with several business owners. Previously, I was a bank branch manager and small business lender, so I have supported and built relationships with all types of small businesses over the years. I have always been passionate about entrepreneurship and have always had a desire to operate my own business. I feel that everything I've done education and career-wise has helped to prepare me for this endeavor. 
Your contribution will help me achieve a life-long dream. 
With the funds raised, I will be able to open the first Tropical Smoothie Cafe in Cobb county and other future locations throughout the Atlanta area.
Why Tropical Smoothie
I chose Tropical Smoothie because of the surge in interest in the health food & nutrition industry. Tropical Smoothie Cafe has delicious and nutritious offerings for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Options include fresh fruit smoothies, sandwiches, flatbreads, wraps, salads, and sides that include fruit, chips, granola, and trail mix. 
Tropical Smoothie is a franchise that has already proven to have a successful concept and thrives in its current markets. (Google reviews and see for yourself!)  Right now, they are looking to break into the Atlanta market and duplicate the success they have in other cities and I want the opportunity to be a part of this venture.

Why I Will Be Successful 

I am both thankful and humbled to have a great support network composed of friends, family, and fellow alumnus from FAMU and Georgia State. Additionally, my father, a retired veteran of the US ARMY, has agreed to go in on this business venture with me. With his support and status, we can take advantage of several benefits awarded to veterans. For example, we plan to pursue catering contracts locally and on the nearby military base (Dobbins AFB) where they honor Veterans First. Veterans First is a program where businesses and government entities alike give consideration to military veterans first when bidding on service contracts which gives us a great advantage.Additionally, I have lots of ideas for community involvement and programs such as health and wellness events, local sponsorships, scholarships, etc. We also have ideas to differentiate product offerings once we build more rapport with the franchise. 
What I Need & What's in it for You The Breakdown:

In order to receive funding, I need to bring a minimum of $20,000 cash to the table. The $10,000 that I am hoping to raise with your support will help me make up for my current shortfall. In the event that I don't raise the full $10,000 within the 60-day period, I will continue to save until I do and then pursue an SBA loan to fund the build out, marketing and initial start-up costs; so no matter what, any and all contributions will go towards this project.
Everyone who contributes in any way, shape or form will be invited to the Grand Opening and will receive their first smoothie or food item for FREE as a Thank You for your support.


Other Ways You Can Help In the event that you can't contribute financially, that doesn't mean you can't help: 
Word of mouth is vital for this type of operation so spreading the word to friends, family, and others via social media and other outlets is a great way to show support.

<p>Formerly used as a warehousing facility, this 13.5 acre piece of property
has been vacant since 2009. And, today presents itself as a perfect opportunity
to improve the way we do things in the world of healthy food.
With the advent of Innovation, hard work and your help together we can set
the benchmark for the future and turn 13 acres into 26 acres of year round food
production. This opportunity will forever change the way we think about food.</p>
<p>The physical farm/plant is a proprietary Sustainable Energy Efficient Design
(<b>SEED™</b>).  SEED™ is a comprehensive advanced micro grid energy
management system proprietary to Eco Grow Farms. The grow system will be powered
onsite. The incorporation of our advanced SEED™ system is the fundamental
component to controlling the cost challenges associated with sustaining a long

<p>Not only do we have to consider new
ideas when it comes to food security, but growing food the Eco Grow Farms way
will provide a protected environment in order to ensure the quality of the
harvest and yield meets the ever growing demand. Our system uses about 90% less
resources and yields an average ratio of 10 to 1, above and beyond conventional
farming methods. Let’s face it, climatic weather events have, and will continue
to be a threat to the food supply and will continue driving higher costs onto
dinner tables world-wide. </p>
<p>Somebody needs to lead the way and this is your opportunity to do it better.
This is a crucial factor in society’s access to our food supply now and in the

<br/></div>","Change the world, support community, create jobs, and feed the
planet. 

Conventional BIG BUSINESS FARMING is no longer cutting the mustard. The
consumer (You) is simply becoming smarter. 
For instance; did you know that the average fruit and vegetable
found in our grocery store travels over 1700 miles from farm to
table. And, it's picked before it's ripened, then gasified before it's put onto
grocery store shelves. Not only that, think of all of the resources that are
consumed in growing and transporting a little head of lettuce. 
People, food, water, land, fossil fuels, innovation and the economy…

With your help, we bring community together, cultivate an unused piece of
property, and turn it into a state-of-the-art-farm that virtually doubles land
capacity, provides solution to conserving natural resources and creates jobs in
one fell swoop!
Change the world. Join the team today! Sponsor a sprout and inspire others!
You become part of the first ever virtual farmer’s network where we embrace
innovative solutions, our natural resources and the quality of food we eat. 
The secret to the Eco Grow Farms is in our SEED™. Our
Sustainable Energy Efficient Design (SEED) is the catalyst that enables a
localized food supply and invigorates economy.
WATERWhen you think about it… we literally have spacecraft traveling to the far
ends of the universe in search for water. 
Water = life, resources, food and our future. 
This is our opportunity to do it better. With your contribution, you will
join The Seed today, Feed Tomorrow campaign. The goal… to preserve
life’s requirements today! Take the Seven Seed challenge and you will be
invited into an exclusive community where you will literally watch your seed
grow via a time lapsed video. Eco Grow Farms will nurture and ensure your
little seed multiplies into many more. Feed the future, seed today!
The solution
Formerly used as a warehousing facility, this 13.5 acre piece of property
has been vacant since 2009. And, today presents itself as a perfect opportunity
to improve the way we do things in the world of healthy food.
With the advent of Innovation, hard work and your help together we can set
the benchmark for the future and turn 13 acres into 26 acres of year round food
production. This opportunity will forever change the way we think about food.
The physical farm/plant is a proprietary Sustainable Energy Efficient Design
(SEED™).  SEED™ is a comprehensive advanced micro grid energy
management system proprietary to Eco Grow Farms. The grow system will be powered
onsite. The incorporation of our advanced SEED™ system is the fundamental
component to controlling the cost challenges associated with sustaining a long
term success of producing nearly 800,000 organic crops per year. 
Environmental control
Not only do we have to consider new
ideas when it comes to food security, but growing food the Eco Grow Farms way
will provide a protected environment in order to ensure the quality of the
harvest and yield meets the ever growing demand. Our system uses about 90% less
resources and yields an average ratio of 10 to 1, above and beyond conventional
farming methods. Let’s face it, climatic weather events have, and will continue
to be a threat to the food supply and will continue driving higher costs onto
dinner tables world-wide. 
Somebody needs to lead the way and this is your opportunity to do it better.
This is a crucial factor in society’s access to our food supply now and in the
future. Sad but true, food is a natural resource that our ever growing
population shall have to fight to keep. Let’s fix it today
What We Need 
1st Goal: Crowd fund and raise $3.5 million dollars. 
Purpose: Purchase a 13.5 acre parcel of commercial land, clean it up,
and convert the property to a farm that generates 26 acres of food production
capacity.
Your generosity will help us reach 30% of the total cost and provide a
myriad of solutions all under one roof. Together we will make the world a
better place! 
What You Get
No matter what your contribution may be, we realize it comes from the
heart and for that we sincerely thank you all for helping to make this world a
better place!  
The Impact
Society can no longer just be reliant on big business, and government to
make the choices about the foods we eat. Change starts with you and I making
little contributions. 
Do you want to change? 
Do you want to create a better food
source for our children?
Do you want to protect vital
“Natural” resources?
Do you want to do it better?
Do you want to be a part of creating
jobs and building economy?
Do you want to help build a stronger
community?
Do you want to make the world a
better place?
If you have answered yes to anyone or all of these questions, then you understand
the impact and benefits we can bring. 
With just a $7 dollar contribution you can sponsor a sprout, feed the planet, create jobs, and
forever change the world. 
Risks & Challenges
The risks and challenges are; we don’t raise enough capital to execute the
plan in full capacity and we have to do extend the time to build this state of
the art farm. The one thing not on our side is time. And, that’s why the time
to act is now. 
Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean
you can't help:

We ask to help spread the word out and make some noise
     about our SEED TODAY FEED TOMORROW campaign.
Make sure you use the Indiegogo share tools!

The main objective is to develop and launch the application as soon as possible.  However, if for any reason the first stage of funding is not achieved, my campaign will continue contacting private technology related investors for the remaining funding and growth.  The funds accumulated represent a group of visionaries users with the desire to enjoy the benefits of the best Same Day Delivery System.  The efforts will continue until the start up is fully operational.

 Marketing at Wilfrid Laurier University. In my first year and a half 
out of school I worked at a software company in sales and business 
development. It was a business to business sales position where I did a 
lot of prospecting as well as following up on leads to establish 
meaningful business relationships. My experience there allowed me to 
learn the techniques and tactics required to break down the initial 
barriers and sales tension with prospective customers and start a 
relationship on the right foot. From this position I became a lot more 
comfortable with speaking with people and it allowed me to connect and 
network with a lot of individuals outside of my job.
</p>
<p>Utilizing this valuable experience as well as my educational background I
 decided I was at the ideal place in my life to begin my own business. I am currently in a program that teaches you all the fundamentals of selling products on Amazon. As many know Amazon is a huge platform that sells an array of products in a buyers market. I have already dealt with suppliers for my product and packaging over the last two months. With all the costs of doing a bulk order of my first product I have realized that funds are going to be dry. </p>
<p>I have created my company name, packaging, design of the toiletry bag and am about a week away from its official launch. Shipping has proven very difficult and costly. As November, December, and January are the highest selling months for my particular product I have created this campaign to help push my launch in the right direction. <br/></p>
<p>I have done extensive research on the competition on Amazon. The keyword itself gets 160000 searches on Amazon per month and the top competition is only selling around 5 items per day during the off season.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to start my own business and this seems like an ample time to do so. I know that my story is not as compelling as others but I had no where else to turn. I have many expenses in my life that are draining my funds and having a huge impact on my budget. <br/></p>
<p>This little bit of funding will help my business enter the market. I have no doubt from that first product launch that I will be able to sell my products and earn the cash flow needed to sustain and grow the business from there.

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The $2000 campaign is meant to be used on the costs of packaging, producing, and shipping my first product from China to USA.</p>
<p>This funding will help me launch my first product. I have already 
reached out to a lot of people in my niche who will be helping with my 
first promotion so sales will be ramping up as soon as my product is 
listed. The $2000 will help me get that product from China to the USA 
and listed on Amazon. From there I will be able to use the profits of my
 sales to reinvest in my company and deliver a larger order for the next
 delivery.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal whatever funds I achieve will be going into a smaller batch order of my product to be shipped over and listed. This will help me in establishing my products presence. However, a smaller batch is not as cost-effective given Amazons terms and fees. If I do enter a smaller order it will give me the ability to show on paper sales and further costs to put into my business plan for future funding.<br/></p> <ul></ul>

<p>Ich heiße Wiebke Nauber und habe bisher hauptberuflich Kinder- und Jugendarbeit in der evangelischen Kirche gemacht, die letzen 14 Jahre in Gruiten, einem kleinen Ort zwischen Wuppertal und Düsseldorf. Immer wieder begegnete mir beruflichlich und privat das Thema Gerechtigkeit und fairer Handel. Und immer wieder hörte und dachte ich: ""Wir müssten viel mehr dafür tun können.""</p>
<p>Ich stellte fest, wie schwierig es ist, in unserer Region faire Kleidung zu kaufen, wenn man sie nicht im Internet bestellen will.

<p>So kam mir der Gedanke: Ich möchte, dass mehr Menschen sich mit diesem Thema auseinandersetzen, dann aber nicht an der Umsetzung scheitern.  Und es entstand die Idee, einen LKW oder Bus umzubauen in einen mobilen Laden für fair gehandelte Kleidung.</p>

<p>Es gibt viele Weltläden in der näheren Umgebung, die Interesse daran haben werden, mich in regelmäßigen Abständen mit dem Gefairt einzuladen und so zumindest z.B. einmal pro Monat auch Kleidung anbieten zu können.</p>
<p>Auf der Messe ""Innatex"" 2016 verschaffte ich mir einen Überblick über das Angebot von fairer Kleidung. Es gibt tolle, coole, schöne, langlebige und bezahlbare Mode. Aktuelle wie zeitlose, für Junge und Alte... Kurz: Ich war begeistert und entschlossen, meinen Traum zu realisieren.</p>
<p>Im Dezember entdeckte mein Mann dann einen  Iveco daily (DHL-Fahrzeug aus den Niederlanden, 6,5 Tonnen, siehe Foto).

Locals is a socially
based business which grows reliable quality organic produce in a vertical farm.
We combine sensors and technology to allow for a continuous sustainable source
of organic produce which is affordable.          Locals is an idea that
grew from the current and growing demand of organic produce that is affordable,
local, and transparent and our desire for corporate social responsibility. We
at Locals want to end the gray deserts and alleviate the toll that factory
farming has on our country by using our sustainable vertical aquaponics growing
system. We connect you to the story behind the produce we grow while building a
better world for this generation and the next. With Locals, we allow for cities
to grow smart.NET ZERO FARM means a building with zero net energy consumption, meaning the total amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is roughly equal to the amount of renewable energy created on the site.

      Our Community Initiatives                                      

VETGRO
VETGRO's purpose is to
harness current veteran’s specialized training and interest and couple with the
training and coursework Locals has so that veterans can do the various
essential positions in Locals.



SEED
SEED purpose is to
give disadvantaged students and adults the needed skills that will allow for
them to be more competitive in the work force , and potential employment
opportunities in Locals.

GROLAB

GROLAB purpose is to
foster  lifelong interest in stem and
agricultural studies  in high school  and college student.HAVEN

HAVEN purpose is to
provide a safe haven for native species through Locals conservation efforts.

SUSTAINAGRO
SUSTAINAGRO purpose is
for Locals to become a more sustainable farm with no negative impact on the
environment. Locals have a mission to become a net zero farm by year five in
operations and for every Locals farm launch in the future to be an net zero
farm.
What is Aquaponics?
Aquaponics is a
sustainable farming method that utilizes aquatic animals and plants in a
symbiotic relationship. In this relationship the aquatic animal’s supplies
nutrients for plants to grow and the plants in turns purify the water.                                                  
                              



Aquaponics Compared to Traditional Agriculture





What are Food Deserts ? 







Food Desert are place where their aren't any fresh produce.
At Locals we don't believe that income or location should factor into whether or not you get healthy quality food. We want to provide people with quality organic produce regardless of income.   So we devise a  naturally efficient way to produce healthy organic produce in a affordable way. We also have partnerships we will use so that every community can have access to our produce.
Our Current System Design 

We currently have a working system design one that allows for quality organic produce and continuous monitoring. We plan on taking this system to the next level thanks to your funds and with the engineering consultant.     
        

           
What are the Benefits?


            
           Organic Produce                          No Fertilizer                  Year Round Growing 

           
          Less Crop Failure                        No Antibiotics                             No GMO's 
              
     Land Conservation           Community Development    Protects Our Waterways



                   Reliable Produce                  Energy Conservation                  Healthy Produce 
               Economic Development        Diverse of Local Produce          Any So Much More    


Where We Are 



We currently have a
small scale aquaponics setup where we are currently conducting research and
development, and are now ready to take what we've learned in our small scale
system and bring it to commercial level.

What's Next



Locals needs to consult with a commercial aquaponics
system designer to redesign our current small scale system to a system that can meet the demand of the public.

Leasing of grow room
Buying needed sensors to allow for continuous monitoring & environmental controls
Building the first line of prototypes
Purchase of fish, seeds and other materials
needed for an aquaponics system
Grow our produce

We are seeking funding to take Locals to the next stage. The funds will be allocated to the startup projects Locals needs to conduct in order to take Locals from an idea to a scalable business. Every donation is important to us as it helps us get one step closer to our goal of launching a successful company.  Once launched we will be able to provide quality organic produce for the masses at affordable prices! All together we can launch Locals!

At each event I give them a goal of 1 to as many as 20 books depending on what level they are.

We usually do not stay at an event longer than 4 hours and they do very well within that time span. I wholesale the books to the kids for $4 and they sell the books for $8 - $10. The lesson is to always double your money or more. You will be either purchasing the book, which is a great read to your child or purchasing at wholesale price to train kids in your local area. I have additional footage of the two children in the video where they are giving more information on their experiences and strategies that I will send to wholesale buyers. Thank you for your support and remember that part of being a good entrepreneur is having the right product or service. This book really does bring in $20/hr per child at most events and festivals, especially at family events.If you need your book(s) fast please send me a comment! Visit us at www.mrameer.com for more information about our books.",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns
