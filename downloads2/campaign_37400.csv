<b>Who we are:</b><h1></h1>
<p>NESSE is a unique bottom-up global network of young researchers and professionals working on innovative solutions to today’s most pressing global environmental challenges. <br/></p>
<p>Currently we have a very basic website. To achieve our bold mission and transform science &amp; technology through our grassroots network we need to build a responsive interactive platform. For this we need experts and your help!</p>

<b>What we want to do:</b>
<h2></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Global sustainability challenges require a new type of scientist and engineer. We need to be collaborative researchers, inspiring thinkers, dreamers, entrepreneurs and storytellers to develop truly disruptive solutions that are available to all. </p>
<p>To do this we need to connect people both globally and locally and share creative, radical ideas. There are thousands of young scientists &amp; engineers who want to use their skills to develop sustainable solutions for the world. With your support we will build a new platform that will enable the conversations, learning and connections for sustainable science &amp; technology. The platform will be:</p>
<ul>
<li> a hub for inspirational stories and videos about the solutions that are already being developed to show everyone a positive vision of the future<br/>
</li>
<li>an interactive organizing space for scientists and engineers to share resources, learn, ask for help and initiate joint projects around global challenges including renewable energy, food security and clean water.<br/>
</li>
<li>a place to discover mentors so that scientists &amp; engineers can build sustainability into their careers and utilise their knowledge and passion</li>
<li>a space to build and connect our growing network of local groups so they can run events, fundraise and share outreach resources.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NESSE has already achieved a huge amount in a year on a shoestring 
budget. We've run events at three international conferences, we've 
supported four local groups to start (with four more starting up), we've
 run a course on ecological economics and reached over 18,000 people through our
 website and communications. <br/></p>

 that will give our members and anyone interested in sustainable science
 the ability to directly engage and participate - to set-up a workshop

<br/>
<p><b>The funding we need:</b><br/></p>
<p><b>To do all this we need to raise $8,000 in total. </b>This will enable us to research potential users to understand how they will use and what they want. It will pay for the back-end building of the interactive infrastructure, the design of the site and maintenance. By creating a platform that is automated, interactive and beautifully designed we will be able to achieve so much more with our resources and reach thousands of people. <br/></p>
<p><b>All of the money we raise will go directly to building the platform, as NESSE is run by a volunteer group of amazing early-career scientists around the world. </b></p>
<p>Via this crowdfunding campaign we hope to raise as much of the money as possible. We are also contacting companies and other organizations for support. And...we’ve already raised <b>$750 from the American Chemical Society</b> and <b>$250 through an amazing interdisciplinary Bio-based Economy event</b> <b>we ran at the University of York.</b> We’re using this to carry out the initial research to understand our users and map the initial site.  <b>So….only $7,000 to go!</b></p>
<p>To actually build the platform that can have an impact on the scale we’re imagining we need your support! If we don’t reach the full amount we will still be able to transform our communication platform. If we raise more we will use it for all the other projects, events and activities we’ve got planned!</p>
<p></p>
<br/>
<p><b>$3,000</b> will enable us to research our users and redesign our existing website </p>
<p><b>$4,500 </b>A new static website will be built that will create the media hub but without user interactivity</p>
<p><b>$6,000 </b>Functional interactive website will be built but not all individual member profile options and project collaborating aspects will be functional  </p>
<p><b>$8,000 </b>Fully functional website which members can use to connect globally and run grassroots events.</p>
<p><b>&gt;$8000 </b>Donations will go directly to funding NESSE events and activities</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Any donations above and beyond our goal will go directly to funding NESSE events worldwide. With additional funding we would be able to hold more events that will engage NESSE members (both individuals and groups) from around the world. This will simultaneously promote local engagement within NESSE member's community as well as foster a sense of connection between NESSE members around the world. </b><br/></p>
<p><b>Who is doing the work:</b><br/></p>
<p>Three fantastic young developers will build the platform. <b>They will need two months to build it and only have time until the end of January.</b> <b>So we need to raise the money now! </b>As soon as you commit to supporting the project we can get started!</p>

<p>20 Dec 2015 i started my journey Round Around The World By Cycle.. I want to ride through out more than 25 countries, I Want to present a TV show based on cycling in different conditions, different tracks, different weather, and verity of food. <br/>I Have many life cycling questions and tricks to show and demonstrate.</p>
<p>How to survive on the road with a cycle? <br/>How to choose the right road for long distance cycling? <br/>How to choose a safe place for stay? <br/>How to choose foods in different weather conditions? <br/>How to ride long distance with minimum calories? <br/>How to ride in hot, summer, and winter conditions? <br/>What is the important equipment needed for your tour? <br/>How to take advantage of sun, air, heat, and water? <br/>How much water, bananas, and bakery products are need for a cyclist? </p>
<p>I am confident when people see this TV SHOW, they will pump up and be confident about long distance cycling. These days in India 10 CR people ride a cycle daily but those are not dare to tour. However after watching this TV show many people will be ready to ride. The base of the show is where to ride, stay ,and what to eat. If I give them info about road quality and elevation, safety places to stay, and preferred nutrition choices for riding, the tips will help solve their basic problems. This show is destined to guide millions of people. <br/>Riding long distance a on cycle is a really adventurous thing. I want to remove this thought from people's mind. Cycling is a simple form of enjoy, traveling, sharing moments, and the source of understanding oneself. This show will benefit people worldwide and give confidence to many people to live a healthier lifestyle, be ecofriendly, and have a taste of adventure.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Welcome to Crystal Ocean    </h3>
<p>My name is JENJEN. I have been a singer/songwriter most of my life, picking up my first guitar, aged 7, encouraged by my wonderful Dad, who designed helicopters, and who now sadly has dementia. I don't normally do covers, but my Dad features on my new album ~ in my cover version of Annie's Song, his and my Mums love song, illuminating their 60+ years together. It is deeply poignant to me in so many ways, that he plays harmonica on this song, and that he remembered every note during recording - such is the power of music to heal and allow us to re-member - a gift we never truly forget..</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501560444/gysqwygzamqldn2wb5c1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My music is inspired by the whales and the dolphins who bring depth and meaning to my life, and joy to my heart. My new album, Crystal Ocean, is dedicated to the waters of Mother Earth, and inspired by this fragile life we all share, that is always only a heartbeat away, and by the delicate intricacies that unite us all together, whichever side of the veil we are on. For all of us have known joy, grief, longing and a feeling of oneness with all of life.</p>
<p>The heartfelt songs on the album are born from my passion for all of life, especially the water and water beings, who I feel a strong affinity with. This album aims to ease our challenges and remind us of our Divine nature and our synergistic connection with all of life. These songs called me from the depths of my being, were born from my experience of this beautiful fragile life, and they are for all of you. In Joy. With love, gratitude, grace, blessings and peace. </p>
<p>This video, along with many others telling the same story, <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/03/whale-found-dying-coast-norway-30-plastic-bags-stomach/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PLASTIC IS KILLING WHALES</a>                  is why we are launching our plastic ocean clean up project. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What is this Campaign for? </strong></h3>
<p>I have created this heartfelt campaign for two reasons. One is to raise money to help complete the production and marketing of my new album, <strong><a href=""http://eepurl.com/bi7h8T"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Ocean</a>. </strong></p>
<p>Weaving triphop, dub, ethnic beats and hang drum, with haunting strings, whalesong, my signature eclectic vocals, and the resonant tones of my beautiful crystal bowls, the album features the amazing talents of New Yorks very own hiphop rap legend Kev Hutch, the extraordinarily talented Maxine Venton (Fat Panthers, Firepit Collective) on strings, Craig R Ninjah on Pantam and Tim Gallagher on baran. </p>
<p>The album has now been mixed and mastered at Abbey Road Studios in London, and we are in the next stages, the production of professionally mastered CD's and a demo music video.</p>
<p>The second reason for this campaign, is to donate a percentage of the album sales towards setting up a vital environmental project which will implement a simple, yet effective strategy to cleanse the world's ocean, rivers and beaches of plastic pollution, while having a positive impact on local, marginalised people, in tourist areas around the world. This global incentive to reduce plastic pollution, also aims to raise awareness of the urgent need for us all to take responsibility. The ocean clean up project is pioneered by Marco Jackson, film maker and producer of The Truth for the Dash for Cash, which helped to raise awareness of the dangers of fracking. </p>
<p>Through our ocean clean up campaign, we will not only raise awareness about our detrimental impact on the natural world, but we will create a solution where we can all become pro-active about our footprint, which is vital if we are not only to survive, but to thrive and shine in this beautiful world we all share together. Our ocean clean up project will effect change within some of the most critical issues on our planet, on a global scale. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We are water. Water is life. All life is sacred.  ❤️</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">PLEASE BE A PART OF OUR GLOBAL PROJECT &amp; </p>

<p>I have written songs and played round camp fires, on stages and at festivals across the UK,  Europe, Canada and USA for many years. I sang in several bands, including Magnum Force (who went on to become punk legends, the Mob), The O'Roonies (Eat Static spin off), and Snipe, who I co-produced, singing with Peewee Ellis (James Brown band) and touring SW England for several years. Snipe were favorited by John Peel, sought after by 4AD, and quoted as being ""the next biggest thing to come out of Bristol after Massive Attack and Portishead,"" before the band split in 2003. </p>
<p>I became a DJ in the early 90's, one of few female DJ's of the time. The hedonism of rave culture became a great escape for a very traumatic time in my life. For over two decades, I toured the globe, resident at many top clubs, playing alongside some of the worlds greatest DJ's and MC's, including Grandmaster Flash,  the Freestylers and Scratch Perverts. The glitz and glamour soon wore off however, and my attention turned back to my guitar, to music production, and I began following my passion for sound.</p>
<p>I qualified as a sound engineer in 1998, increasingly fascinated with sound, harmonic frequencies, vibration, and the healing power of quartz crystal singing bowls, of which I am blessed with 14! Learning music production meant I could weave together all the wonderful grooves and sounds I could hear in my head and in the natural world around me, and I began to produce beautiful, funky and etheric soundscapes, which kept me connected to something greater than ""this,"" gave me a sense of well-being, but mostly, kept me attuned to mySelf, my higher nature.  I  learned the art of video production and was never without my video camera, recording weird and wonderful footage to use in my music videos.</p>
<p>Following the tragic loss of my partner in 2009, I travelled the world, hungry for healing. I swam with whales and dolphins, and explored the depths of my soul, as well as exotic corners of the globe. I began to see the degradation in the ocean, and the growing threat to our wonderful planet and her most loyal, magnificent guardians, our whales and dolphins. </p>
<p>Manifesting some of the world's finest studios to record in, from Mick Fleetwood's in Maui, to Stanley Jordan's in Arizona, using Frank Zappa's U87 mic in LA, mixing and mastering at Real World with TIm Oliver in Bath, it took me 8 years, amidst my grief and wonder, to record and produce my debut album... Finally in 2012, <a href=""https://jenjen.bandcamp.com/album/enter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ENTER</a>, my ""lament"" to my beloved Mark, and to my Divine Self, was born.</p>
<p>Since my first album release, it has been in my bones to return to my trip-hop, dub and breakbeat roots for my next album;  to produce something more upbeat, that would also serve to raise awareness of the plight within the ocean, and critical issues in our world as a whole. An album which combines the grooves and funk of my favourite dance genres, with shamanic, healing sounds from nature, and the myriad of world music I have discovered on my travels.</p>
<p>My music has been compared to Portishead, Thom Yorke, Liz Fraser (Cocteau Twins), Enya, Kate Bush, early Massive Attack, Sandy Denny, Joan Baez, Natasha Atlas, Joni Mitchell, Melanie, and Aphex Twin!​​</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to Crystal Ocean    
My name is JENJEN. I have been a singer/songwriter most of my life, picking up my first guitar, aged 7, encouraged by my wonderful Dad, who designed helicopters, and who now sadly has dementia. I don't normally do covers, but my Dad features on my new album ~ in my cover version of Annie's Song, his and my Mums love song, illuminating their 60+ years together. It is deeply poignant to me in so many ways, that he plays harmonica on this song, and that he remembered every note during recording - such is the power of music to heal and allow us to re-member - a gift we never truly forget..

My music is inspired by the whales and the dolphins who bring depth and meaning to my life, and joy to my heart. My new album, Crystal Ocean, is dedicated to the waters of Mother Earth, and inspired by this fragile life we all share, that is always only a heartbeat away, and by the delicate intricacies that unite us all together, whichever side of the veil we are on. For all of us have known joy, grief, longing and a feeling of oneness with all of life.
The heartfelt songs on the album are born from my passion for all of life, especially the water and water beings, who I feel a strong affinity with. This album aims to ease our challenges and remind us of our Divine nature and our synergistic connection with all of life. These songs called me from the depths of my being, were born from my experience of this beautiful fragile life, and they are for all of you. In Joy. With love, gratitude, grace, blessings and peace. 
This video, along with many others telling the same story, PLASTIC IS KILLING WHALES                  is why we are launching our plastic ocean clean up project. 
 
What is this Campaign for? 
I have created this heartfelt campaign for two reasons. One is to raise money to help complete the production and marketing of my new album, Crystal Ocean. 
Weaving triphop, dub, ethnic beats and hang drum, with haunting strings, whalesong, my signature eclectic vocals, and the resonant tones of my beautiful crystal bowls, the album features the amazing talents of New Yorks very own hiphop rap legend Kev Hutch, the extraordinarily talented Maxine Venton (Fat Panthers, Firepit Collective) on strings, Craig R Ninjah on Pantam and Tim Gallagher on baran. 
The album has now been mixed and mastered at Abbey Road Studios in London, and we are in the next stages, the production of professionally mastered CD's and a demo music video.
The second reason for this campaign, is to donate a percentage of the album sales towards setting up a vital environmental project which will implement a simple, yet effective strategy to cleanse the world's ocean, rivers and beaches of plastic pollution, while having a positive impact on local, marginalised people, in tourist areas around the world. This global incentive to reduce plastic pollution, also aims to raise awareness of the urgent need for us all to take responsibility. The ocean clean up project is pioneered by Marco Jackson, film maker and producer of The Truth for the Dash for Cash, which helped to raise awareness of the dangers of fracking. 
Through our ocean clean up campaign, we will not only raise awareness about our detrimental impact on the natural world, but we will create a solution where we can all become pro-active about our footprint, which is vital if we are not only to survive, but to thrive and shine in this beautiful world we all share together. Our ocean clean up project will effect change within some of the most critical issues on our planet, on a global scale. 
We are water. Water is life. All life is sacred.  ❤️
PLEASE BE A PART OF OUR GLOBAL PROJECT & 
DONATE TO OUR OCEAN CLEAN UP CAMPAIGN
 IN EXCHANGE FOR SOME GREAT MUSIC. 
Every little helps this awesome project and our ocean ! THANKYOU! 

​   CRYSTAL OCEAN

 
Several years in the making, the songs for this album have now been mixed and mastered at Abbey Rd studios in London,  but there is still some way to go to release and promote my new album, Crystal Ocean.
The final stage is to turn these 10 tracks into a professional masterpiece, replicate CDs, and birth the album into the world. With your sweet kindness and generosity, we can do this. ❤️

What needs to be done?  
Things that need to be done to complete this musical adventure, release the album, and launch our ocean clean up project are :
Mixing and Mastering - Completed! 
CD production ~ £1300
Professional PR, radio and Digital Marketing campaign ~ £1500
Artwork, Cover Design ~ £500
Demo video production ~ £1000
Funds for making the documentary and a proposal to launch the ocean clean up campaign will be raised through sponsors, backers and album sales...

Challenges 
The album is almost completed, artwork done, CD production is underway, and digital marketers lined up to ensure album sales. With an expert team of visionarys, a motivated film-maker, dynamic fund-raiser and creative entrepreneur,  all exemplary at achieving success in effecting much needed change in the world, we are well on the way to achieving our goal of launching both the album, and the ocean clean up campaign. 
As well as thru your kind donations and album sales, our ocean clean-up proposal will be backed by funders and sponsors, before launching the project to Governments of the world. Our major challenge, and all we really need, is an extra boost of financial help to ensure our project is made visible, highlighted - and fulfilled - through a highly effective marketing strategy - to the most influential people, environmental activists and pro-active eco-warriors in the world.
Together, we can do this ❤️

   My Story & Bio
I have written songs and played round camp fires, on stages and at festivals across the UK,  Europe, Canada and USA for many years. I sang in several bands, including Magnum Force (who went on to become punk legends, the Mob), The O'Roonies (Eat Static spin off), and Snipe, who I co-produced, singing with Peewee Ellis (James Brown band) and touring SW England for several years. Snipe were favorited by John Peel, sought after by 4AD, and quoted as being ""the next biggest thing to come out of Bristol after Massive Attack and Portishead,"" before the band split in 2003. 
I became a DJ in the early 90's, one of few female DJ's of the time. The hedonism of rave culture became a great escape for a very traumatic time in my life. For over two decades, I toured the globe, resident at many top clubs, playing alongside some of the worlds greatest DJ's and MC's, including Grandmaster Flash,  the Freestylers and Scratch Perverts. The glitz and glamour soon wore off however, and my attention turned back to my guitar, to music production, and I began following my passion for sound.
I qualified as a sound engineer in 1998, increasingly fascinated with sound, harmonic frequencies, vibration, and the healing power of quartz crystal singing bowls, of which I am blessed with 14! Learning music production meant I could weave together all the wonderful grooves and sounds I could hear in my head and in the natural world around me, and I began to produce beautiful, funky and etheric soundscapes, which kept me connected to something greater than ""this,"" gave me a sense of well-being, but mostly, kept me attuned to mySelf, my higher nature.  I  learned the art of video production and was never without my video camera, recording weird and wonderful footage to use in my music videos.

The goal is to create a future internet platform, so people can have access from any device, and to provide knowledge regarding the proper use of natural resources.          What are the problems or conflicts related to this topic?Did you know that the colony of California sea lions found in the National Park Espiritu Santo island is one of the most important tourist-economic resources for the inhabitants of La Paz Baja California Sur? This makes it a natural resource of great importance for the world.                                                                                           This colony is one of the most visited by tourists because of its easy access. As a result, this place has one of the highest rates of human-sea lion interaction,          Propitiating that some providers of tourism service, make recklessness for not having the necessary training for this type of activities, causing disturbances in the behavior of sea lions and risking tourists during the course of the trip.                  Another problem is with sea lions that accidentally become entangled in fishing nets and are not taken care of in time. Have you ever seen a sea lion or other animal injured due to human activities? Is a feeling of impotence that arises when not being able to do anything to avoid or to reverse this situation.      It is becoming impossible for the authorities to patrol the area full time. This initiative seeks to provide a solution to these problems and to allow you the opportunity to help these marine mammals when they are in trouble, as well as helping to promote the sustainable use of the area for both tourists and the sea lions. ABOUT US This is an initiative of M.Sc. Ricardo Mirsha Mata-Cruz, Dr. Fernando Elorriaga-Verplancken, and M.Sc. Marcia Valenzuela-Molina from Centro Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Marinas, which belongs to Instituto Politécnico Nacional (CICIMAR-IPN) in La Paz, México, in collaboration with the Biol. Irma González-López from the Natural Protected Area (NPA), denominated as “Marine Area of the Espíritu Santo Archipelago National Park”, from the Comisión Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas (CONANP).(help us sharing  in the social media) 
What are the solutions we propose?In the long run, we are trying to consolidate a social surveillance network using a website and an app for mobile phones that will be used to access videos (e.g. see video below) and images taken in real time by IP cameras (Internet Protocol system for a future internet connection).                                                
Besides this access to images and videos, people will receive useful information regarding the Natural Protected Area and how they can visit this place, they will also be able to visualize the experiences of others tourists (video below).                                                
 What are the steps to follow in order to achieve our goal?Step one: Prototype network. Installation of IP camera in Los Islotes, a rookery where you can find one of the most important California sea lion colony (See flow chart).Step two: Creation of a webpage and a mobile app. This will be used as a link to provide interactive and educative information about California sea lions, and additional information about tourist activities that take place in the area.Step three: Social surveillance network. Society will be able to learn and participate in the conservation of this species, through the use of electronic devices.      Your support will help us to accomplish 
the first step of this project!
 How your donation will help us?A surveillance system using an IP camera will be installed in Los Islotes; previously, we will determine the best location to place the devices. This non-invasive technique will promote the beginning of California sea lion surveillance network.         The budget presented below belongs to expenses related to the equipment needed to install the IP camera in the study site.

 The installation of the surveillance system will allow short-term recording of the following information:-Natural behavior of sea lions with respect to tide changes, as well as presence and absence of tourists.        -Entangled (injuries caused by fishing nets) sea lions as well as other accidents that could be related to the tourist interactions. Such data will be recorded and reported to the authorities.        - The responsible interaction between tourists and sea lions and their environment.        *Recordings will be share with the community and authorities periodically in this first step; subsequently, with the project progress we will continue to push forward the second and third step to accomplish real time transmission. What are the benefits in the future?

Por ello, en este proyecto se busca implementar estas ventajas en beneficio de una especie prioritaria del Golfo de California el lobo marino.Con tu apoyo será posible establecer la primera etapa del proyecto piloto para crear una red de vigilancia social dirigida a esta especie, el cual consistirá en colocar la primera cámara de grabación en una colonia de lobos marinos ubicada en el Golfo de California con la finalidad de crear en el futuro una plataforma de Internet a la cual la comunidad podrá acceder desde cualquier dispositivo y así fomentar el adecuado aprovechamiento de los recursos naturales.       ¿Cuáles son los problemas o conflictos relacionados con el tema?Sabías que la colonia de lobos marinos de California que se encuentra en el parque Nacional de La Isla Espíritu Santo, es uno de los recursos turístico-económicos más importantes para los habitantes de La Paz Baja California Sur, convirtiéndolo en un recurso natural de gran importancia para el mundo.                            Esta colonia es una de las más visitadas por grupos turísticos, debido al fácil acceso a la zona y por ende es una de las loberas con una mayor interacción con los humanos.        Propiciando que algunos prestadores de servicio turístico, cometan imprudencias por no tener el entrenamiento necesario para este tipo de actividades, ocasionando perturbaciones en el comportamiento de los lobos marinos y arriesgando a los turistas en el transcurso del viaje.                    Otro problema son los lobos marinos que se enredan accidentalmente en las redes de pesca. ¿Alguna vez has visto a un lobo marino u otro animal herido debido a descuidos humanos? es una sensación de impotencia que surge al no poder hacer algo para evitar o revertir esto.          El monitoreo constante por parte de las autoridades para vigilar el área se ha vuelto difícil. Esta iniciativa busca dar una solución a estas problemáticas y darte la oportunidad de ayudar a estos mamíferos marinos cuando se encuentren en problemas. Además de ayudar a que se use la zona de forma sustentable, para el beneficio de los turistas y del lobo marino. 
Quiénes somos Esta es una iniciativa del M. en C.  Ricardo Mirsha Mata Cruz, el Dr. Fernando Elorriaga Verplancken y la M. en C. Marcia Valenzuela Molina del Centro Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Marinas perteneciente al Instituto Politécnico Nacional (CICIMAR-IPN) en La Paz, B.C.S., en colaboración con la Biol. Irma González López del área natural protegida (ANP) Parque Nacional zona marina del Archipiélago de Espíritu Santo de la Comisión Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas (CONANP). (Compártelo en las redes sociales) ¿Cuáles son las soluciones que propone este proyecto? Lo que se busca lograr a largo plazo es consolidar una red de vigilancia social a través de una plataforma en Internet, basado en una página web y una aplicación (app) para teléfonos móviles, en donde se pueda acceder a vídeos (Ejemplo de vídeo abajo) e imágenes en tiempo real captadas por cámaras IP (cámaras con Protocolo de Internet, para que se puedan conectar a la red en el futuro).                                                  
Además de poder acceder a las imágenes y vídeos, las personas podrán obtener información útil del área natural protegida y de cómo poder visitar el lugar, así como de visualizar y conocer experiencias de otras personas (vídeo abajo).                                                
 ¿Cuáles son los pasos a seguir para lograr el objetivo del proyecto?Primera etapa: red prototipo. Instalación de una cámara IP en Los Islotes, lugar donde se encuentra una de las colonias más importantes de lobo marino (ver el diagrama de flujo).Segunda etapa: creación de una página web y una app móvil. Servirá como un enlace para brindar información interactiva y educativa a las personas e información adicional sobre las actividades turísticas que se lleven a cabo en la zona.  Tercera etapa: red de vigilancia social. Donde la comunidad podrá aprender y participar en la conservación de esta especie, mediante el uso de dispositivos electrónicos.            ¡Con tu apoyo lograremos llevar a cabo 
la primera etapa de este proyecto!
 ¿Cómo tu donación nos ayudará?Se colocará un sistema de vigilancia utilizando una cámara IP en Los Islotes; previamente, se determinará cual es la mejor ubicación para instalar los dispositivos. Ésta técnica no invasiva impulsará el comienzo de la Red de vigilancia del lobo marino de California.         El presupuesto que se muestra a continuación corresponde a los gastos necesarios para adquirir el equipo de instalación de la cámara IP en el área de estudio.

<p>Planet Healers is a non-profit that started in 2004. Over the last two years we have been researching carbon sequestration as a method of funding our ecological restoration projects in tropical areas. To begin, we have purchased 100 acres of highly impacted ranchland to set aside in a reserve and plan to restore tropical forest on that land. We are selling carbon credits to fund this and future habitat restoration projects. The more funds we raise the more area that we can plant!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are in the Yucatan, which has the second largest tropical forest after the amazon. Mexico is also one of the top 5 countries for biodiversity. Here many areas of forest have been cleared and degraded for agriculture, wood and tourism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In his nursery in Canada, Paul grew hundreds of thousands of native plants every year. For the last year and a half he has been learning how to grow tropical trees since his nursery in Canada grew temperate trees there is much to learn but his skills are easily transferable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tropical trees grow fast, much faster than in Canada.  On average each tropical tree will sequester 50 pounds of carbon a year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In January, we will begin growing the trees needed to plant when the rains return in June.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The funds will be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase land to ensure that the restored habitat will be conserved in perpetuity,</li>
<li>Create a nursery to grow the plants for our projects: shade cloth, posts, irrigation, pots, coconut fiber, seed collection and processing equipment,</li>
<li>Grow and buy a diversity of native tropical trees,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Give local people a fair wage to plant the trees and manage the land,</li>
<li>Train local people to grow their own trees and do habitat restoration,</li>
<li>Help other groups get funding for their projects.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We are just starting out and need your support to get things rolling. We plan to be able to restore hundreds of acres of tropical forest each year as our project gets rolling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The funds we raise will be used to help create a native tropical tree nursery for our project</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please help us to do this good work. By restoring degraded land we are increasing biodiversity, combating climate change, restoring the water cycle and helping to alleviating poverty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have destroyed so much of this planet. It’s time to give something back. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>There are many reasons why we are doing this:</p>
<h3>1<sup>st</sup>: Many Creatures are Declining and need our help!</h3>
<p>""Habitat destruction and degradation are the leading threats""</p>
<p>Species loss worldwide is extremely high, not only that but the loss of genetic diversity within the remaining populations of creatures is also declining rapidly.</p>
<p>On the picture to the right you can see that large numbers of species in the world that are threatened. Recently World Wildlife Fund announced that we are on track to lose 2/3 of all wild species.</p>
<p>Amphibians are highly susceptible to environmental change and are declining rapidly worldwide. They are our canary in the coal mine! Will we listen?</p>
<p>Mammals -One in two mammal species on Earth are in decline and at least one in four are at risk of disappearing forever. Think about all the large mammals and predator species and what it would be like to not have any of them for our grandchildren.</p>
<p>Many birds are in decline, as they have to pass through large areas without habitat. Song birds being one of the ones hit hardest with their long migrations through areas deforested and converted to agriculture, cities and mining.</p>
<p>Pollinators (Bees, Butterflies…) are also in decline worldwide. In the past the native bees did the work of pollinating for us for free but with the size of farms increasing and the removal of all windrows there are not enough pollinators left to pollinate out crops. So we use the European Honeybee to do the job for us now. However they are in decline as well and are suffering what is called colony collapse disorder, some years losing half the colonies! Think for a minute about all the food you eat and how many of those fruits and vegetables you would not be able to eat without pollination.</p>
<h3>2<sup>nd</sup> Global Warming.</h3>
<p>Global warming will be a strong driver of global species loss as well and we are already seeing those losses. What has happened to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia is a tragedy that will not recover in our lifetimes. The loss of coral is happening all over the world and it is a direct result of warming oceans and the acidification of the oceans from carbon dioxide. There is no place in this world that will not be changed by global warming and I’m glad that people are finally standing up to do something about it.</p>
<p>The world desperately needs this and we are responding to that need.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Morris, </strong>an expert in the fields of ecology, botany, ecosystem restoration and gardening with native plants, is an engaging speaker who has presented at a wide variety of venues, including the Royal Botanical Gardens, Society for Ecological Restoration and the Natural Habitat Conference. His depth of knowledge of native plants is inspiring and practical.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Paul spent time with his father and grandfather landscape painting in his youth, these times fostered a passion for the outdoors and natural history. Later he completed his undergraduate degree at Waterloo University in biology and then went on to complete his Masters at Acadia University in Nova Scotia. He was the owner of Acorus Restoration Native Plant Nursery for twenty years. Giving him extensive experience in wetland, forest and prairie restoration ecology and conservation biology making him a leader in the design and planting of restoration areas. Environment Canada also asked him to co-author a manual on prairie and meadow restoration. He restored sections of his 95-acre farm and has completed numerous projects across Ontario, including Eco-parks, wastewater and storm water ponds, and naturalization for private homeowners.</p>

Her high sensitivity in the arts, found an inexhaustible source of inspiration in nature. Upon completion of his studies in agronomy, specializing in ornamental horticulture, she spent time in nature looking at alternatives to the growing demand in floriculture and her interest in research allowed her to specialize in the field of ​​biotechnology and plant micropropagation. After graduating, she was hired by a company that exported  ornamentals, which developed her skills to supervise, direct, and coordinate greenhouses, field areas and personnel. Following this, she created the concept of Green Point Applied Plant Biotechnology, a company dedicated to the development of technologies for micropropagation systems. At that time, she collaborated to direct the tissue culture lab and the area of ​​ecology for one company over 10 years. She developed all the research and protocols for rescue, propagation and management of wild species found. After that she decided to integrate Green Point area landscaping, vertical ecosystems and environmental technologies. This allowed her to simultaneously develop consultation and training in the biotechnology area and create artwork with vertical ecosystems.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some of the risks that we face include:</p>
<p>Living in a remote area items are difficult to find sometimes. Language, local customs, working with local governments in the villages can be an issue. Sophia is Mexican so she is able to navigate our way through though.</p>
<p>We currently have only a generator and rely on our windmill for water. It would be great to have some solar panels! So we have run into times where we are low on water and have to do minimal watering.</p>

<p><strong>Please share our campaign</strong> as wildly as possible with your friend and family!</p>
<p>Please use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>Anyone who has a keen interest can <strong>volunteer</strong> to help us at Earth Connection Center. Planet Healers is one of our projects. Planet Healers funds are collected and administered separately from the Center. If anyone wants to fund the center as well that would be outstanding!</p>
<p><strong>Items Needed</strong> (some of which are shared with Earth Connection):</p>
<p>Solar Panels, batteries, charger and invertor</p>

</div></div>","Planet Healers is a non-profit that started in 2004. Over the last two years we have been researching carbon sequestration as a method of funding our ecological restoration projects in tropical areas. To begin, we have purchased 100 acres of highly impacted ranchland to set aside in a reserve and plan to restore tropical forest on that land. We are selling carbon credits to fund this and future habitat restoration projects. The more funds we raise the more area that we can plant!
 
We are in the Yucatan, which has the second largest tropical forest after the amazon. Mexico is also one of the top 5 countries for biodiversity. Here many areas of forest have been cleared and degraded for agriculture, wood and tourism.
 
In his nursery in Canada, Paul grew hundreds of thousands of native plants every year. For the last year and a half he has been learning how to grow tropical trees since his nursery in Canada grew temperate trees there is much to learn but his skills are easily transferable.
 
Tropical trees grow fast, much faster than in Canada.  On average each tropical tree will sequester 50 pounds of carbon a year.
 
In January, we will begin growing the trees needed to plant when the rains return in June.
 
The funds will be used to:

Purchase land to ensure that the restored habitat will be conserved in perpetuity,
Create a nursery to grow the plants for our projects: shade cloth, posts, irrigation, pots, coconut fiber, seed collection and processing equipment,
Grow and buy a diversity of native tropical trees,


Give local people a fair wage to plant the trees and manage the land,
Train local people to grow their own trees and do habitat restoration,
Help other groups get funding for their projects.

 
We are just starting out and need your support to get things rolling. We plan to be able to restore hundreds of acres of tropical forest each year as our project gets rolling.
 
The funds we raise will be used to help create a native tropical tree nursery for our project
 
Please help us to do this good work. By restoring degraded land we are increasing biodiversity, combating climate change, restoring the water cycle and helping to alleviating poverty.
 
We have destroyed so much of this planet. It’s time to give something back. Thank you.
 
The Impact
There are many reasons why we are doing this:
1st: Many Creatures are Declining and need our help!
""Habitat destruction and degradation are the leading threats""
Species loss worldwide is extremely high, not only that but the loss of genetic diversity within the remaining populations of creatures is also declining rapidly.
On the picture to the right you can see that large numbers of species in the world that are threatened. Recently World Wildlife Fund announced that we are on track to lose 2/3 of all wild species.
Amphibians are highly susceptible to environmental change and are declining rapidly worldwide. They are our canary in the coal mine! Will we listen?
Mammals -One in two mammal species on Earth are in decline and at least one in four are at risk of disappearing forever. Think about all the large mammals and predator species and what it would be like to not have any of them for our grandchildren.
Many birds are in decline, as they have to pass through large areas without habitat. Song birds being one of the ones hit hardest with their long migrations through areas deforested and converted to agriculture, cities and mining.
Pollinators (Bees, Butterflies…) are also in decline worldwide. In the past the native bees did the work of pollinating for us for free but with the size of farms increasing and the removal of all windrows there are not enough pollinators left to pollinate out crops. So we use the European Honeybee to do the job for us now. However they are in decline as well and are suffering what is called colony collapse disorder, some years losing half the colonies! Think for a minute about all the food you eat and how many of those fruits and vegetables you would not be able to eat without pollination.
2nd Global Warming.
Global warming will be a strong driver of global species loss as well and we are already seeing those losses. What has happened to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia is a tragedy that will not recover in our lifetimes. The loss of coral is happening all over the world and it is a direct result of warming oceans and the acidification of the oceans from carbon dioxide. There is no place in this world that will not be changed by global warming and I’m glad that people are finally standing up to do something about it.
The world desperately needs this and we are responding to that need.
Paul Morris, an expert in the fields of ecology, botany, ecosystem restoration and gardening with native plants, is an engaging speaker who has presented at a wide variety of venues, including the Royal Botanical Gardens, Society for Ecological Restoration and the Natural Habitat Conference. His depth of knowledge of native plants is inspiring and practical.
 
Paul spent time with his father and grandfather landscape painting in his youth, these times fostered a passion for the outdoors and natural history. Later he completed his undergraduate degree at Waterloo University in biology and then went on to complete his Masters at Acadia University in Nova Scotia. He was the owner of Acorus Restoration Native Plant Nursery for twenty years. Giving him extensive experience in wetland, forest and prairie restoration ecology and conservation biology making him a leader in the design and planting of restoration areas. Environment Canada also asked him to co-author a manual on prairie and meadow restoration. He restored sections of his 95-acre farm and has completed numerous projects across Ontario, including Eco-parks, wastewater and storm water ponds, and naturalization for private homeowners.

Or to anyone you think might love our chocolate bars! We are so grateful to everything you have done to support our business, and look forward to making you only the very best chocolate in exchange.</p><p>Please share this campaign through Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. </p></div>","Switching to a sustainable method of shipping allows us to more fully impact the chocolate making industry and forges a path for other like-minded businesses to choose sail cargo. Standard-use container ships are incredibly polluting, with heavy oil emissions that are toxic to air and water.This shipment will also help us make delicious chocolate sourced from the Sierra Nevada region of Colombia, a unique mountain coastal region with a genetic variety of cacao considered the most sought-after in the world.  We are seeking your support to help with the high cost to dock, offload cargo, and comply with US Customs regulations for this first shipment of cacao. Since we are part of only three first importers on this voyage, the price tag of pioneering this trip is high. BUT, if this works, and it will work... more small businesses like us will be willing to join in and import their products using sustainable trade. Having more importers on board (literally) with products on the boat, will spread the compliance costs and make financial sense as a viable emission-free alternative to conventional trade.  Shipping via sail cargo is not more expensive than conventional shipping, but the US import and Customs costs are oriented towards larger/container-ship operations. What We NeedThe price tag for cargo docking in the US is the highest in the world. We have worked very hard, contacted ports all up and down the East Coast and were able to find one that is the most economical and also excited about accepting our vessel.  Money raised during this campaign will be used to:
Pay fees at Morehead City Port NC. (dockage, security, wharfage): $1300
Stevedores: $1500
Shipping Agent & Bond: $2300
Tugs: $1600
Customs and Border Fees: $1300
ACE Provider: $500
Customs Broker: $800
Port to Factory Transportation: $400
Stretch Goal: Provide $3000 in grant funding to restore the Brigantes sail vessel, thereby expanding capacity for future eco-friendly trade routes for cacao and other native products.
River-Sea Chocolates needs your help! Support our campaign for the first US sustainable trade voyage, and we will provide you with a delicious reward. In exchange for contributions made to our campaign, we are offering a range of perks that will appeal to all chocolate lovers. Our campaign rewards include our handcrafted chocolate bars, private chocolate-making parties, a year of chocolate, or a custom chocolate line designed for you, your business, or to celebrate a loved one at a party or event. Our StoryOwners Krissee and Mariano began their chocolate journey with their three kids when visiting family in Brazil. The kids (& Mariano) climbed a cacao tree in their cousin’s backyard, picked some cacao fruit and asked how to make chocolate. Through a process of experimentation and discovery, the entire family soon fell in love with the art and science of chocolate making, they even met a sloth along the way! Krissee and Mariano began exploring the possibility of creating an environmentally friendly product that could benefit farmers and their communities in developing countries. They decided to devote their future to it, and quickly distinguished River-Sea Chocolates from other bean-to-bar makers with a less refined taste, emphasizing the rustic aspects of cacao that through roasting and manual production methods convey layers of deep complexity.After two years in business, River-Sea Chocolates is now seeking your support to enter our next phase of growth and increase the environmental sustainability of our supply chain by bringing our inaugural shipment of Colombian cacao beans via wind powered cargo ship!  We are incredibly proud to be forging a path for businesses like ours to begin using more sustainable trade and shipping methods. Sail transport reduces carbon emissions by 99% over conventional cargo transport, while providing a more nimble and efficient sustainable solution for trade. With this project we hope to demonstrate sail transport as a viable emission-free option for the small business import/export sector.  The ChocolateThese cacao beans are sourced from the Sierra Nevada region of Colombia, a unique coastal mountain range where snow-capped mountains overlook the Caribbean sea. The farms encompass a region known for the most sought-after variety of cacao; Criollo, which is characterized by low bitterness and heavy floral tasting notes. The beans are grown by indigenous farmers working in partnership with an international project established to eliminate cocaine trafficking. River-Sea owners Krissee and Mariano just returned from visiting Santa Marta Colombia where they were able to meet with the people who are making this emission-free cacao possible: local indigenous farmers, trade facilitators, suppliers, some of the sail ship crew and the ship captain, Remi Lavergne. 


 

 
Now we are seeking your support to bring our first 2,000lb shipment of sustainable supply-chain cacao using the most environmentally sustainable method of transport available. We hope that through our participation we can fund the restoration/construction of more sail vessels, increase sail trade routes and further grow this movement towards sustainable shipping. We hope you will join us in supporting our mission and stoking the Fair Transport revolution! Please share this campaign with any friends that share our love for chocolate, sustainability, fair trade, and respect for craft and traditional cultures. The ImpactCurrently around 90% of world trade is carried out by cargo ships that pollute oceans and contribute to global carbon emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), estimates that 2.8% of global emissions were released via cargo ships in 2015. To quote the creators of Fair Transport, ""if the shipping industry were a country, it would be between Japan and Germany as the seventh largest contributor to global CO2 emissions."" The IMO has made a commitment to achieve 30% greater efficiency of maritime vessels by 2025, and reduce global emissions from container ships by 50% by 2050, but that is not soon enough. Together River-Sea Chocolates and Tres Hombres Shipping hope to educate and raise awareness about the importance of environmentally sustainable shipping methods, and enter an ongoing partnership that would reduce River-Sea’s cacao-sourcing to a near zero-emissions model. The first sail-cargo shipment of beans are on their last leg of the journey, arriving on Mainland US as early as mid-April, depending on the wind. Look for further emails and updates announcing our progress. About Tres Hombres and Fair Transport:Tres Hombres Shipping is the first modern day cargo ship with a 99% reduction in its carbon dioxide emissions. The company was founded with the mission to become the world’s first modern “emission free” shipping company. The ship Tres Hombres has been sailing since 2009, maintaining trade routes between Europe, islands in the Atlantic, the Caribbean, and South America. More information can be found on their website: https://www.treshombres.eu/  About River-Sea Chocolates:River-Sea Chocolates creates delicious artisan chocolate using premium quality cacao sourced from small-scale sustainable farms around the world.

<br/><p>Énergie Est abandonne aussi bien Justin Trudeau que Thomas Mulcair au gré du vent. Les deux appuient publiquement l’oléoduc, mais ils voudraient bien passer cela sous silence.

</div></div>","Cliquez ici pour la version française...ECO (Étudiants et Étudiantes Contre les Oléoducs) is a coalition of Quebec student associations with a single goal: stop the Energy East pipeline. Like any good student, when our scientists speak with one voice, we listen to them. Climate change is real, and it threatens our survival.The United Nations, the nobel-prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and 97% of climate scientists agree: we have a carbon budget. If we build Energy East, or any other mega-pipelines which service the tar sands, we cannot hope to respect that budget.The latest research, in the journal Nature, confirms that we must leave 85% of the tar sands oil in the soil if we are to avoid catastrophic and irreversible climate change.Powerful social movements have stalled proposed pipelines to the west and south, and now the stage is set for a showdown between the pipeline companies and the citizens of Quebec.We need your help to fund the resistance. 2015 is an election year, but despite the fact that two-thirds of Quebecers, and half of Canadians, oppose Energy East, all three major federal parties support the pipeline. Maybe we missed a lesson, but the version of democracy we were taught involved at least one major party representing the views of half the population.Energy East has both Justin Trudeau and Tom Mulcair twisting in the wind. Both publicly support the pipeline, but would like most of us to forget that they do. In Quebec, where over two-thirds of the population oppose Energy East, both of their parties have a lot to lose from a campaign which emphasizes their support for the pipeline. Under the circumstances, we believe we can exert enough pressure to force the Liberals or the NDP, if not both, to change their position on Energy East before the election.It’s time to demand better from the people we elect. It’s time to demand democracy. If you donate today, and share this video with all your friends, we’ll use your money to make sure that no politician can campaign in Quebec without being confronted over their pipeline hypocrisy.If we succeed in forcing even one party to change its position, it could change the future of our country, and even our planet. So what are you waiting for?We charge no membership fees, and any Quebec student association can join our coalition and vote in our meetings. We participate in any and all broader coalitions which share our values and work alongside First Nations, community groups, labour, Environmental NGOs and anyone else with an unequivocal position against Energy East.Every dollar we raise in this campaign will go directly to fund the fight against Energy East:
We will use civil disobedience and nonviolent direct action to pressure political parties and candidates at all levels to sign a pledge committing to oppose Energy East;
We will mobilize students to participate in demonstrations, and towards mass climate mobilizations in April;
We will organize a national network of pipeline opponents on campuses, training students to execute autonomous direct actions in their communities;
We will promote the actions of our members, and ensure that the voice of Quebec students is well-represented in the media;
We will build a permanent institution capable of rapid-action student response to pipelines and other climate threats.


We need your money, but more than that we need your solidarity. If everyone who reads this far takes the time to share this campaign on Facebook and Twitter, we’ll reach our goal with ease. So there’s just one question left: can we count on you to spread the word, and share this campaign on all your social networks? Can you email your parents, grandparents, friends and aunts and uncles?
One gesture is enough to start a chain-reaction, and this is that gesture.
All it takes to change the world is you.

Version française



ECO est une coalition d’associations étudiantes québécoises qui ont un objectif commun: bloquer l’oléoduc Énergie Est. En bon-ne-s étudiant-e-s, lorsque les scientifiques parlent d’une même voix, nous les écoutons. Les changements climatiques sont une réalité et menacent notre survie.
Les Nations Unies, le Panel intergouvernemental sur les changements climatiques (gagnant du Prix Nobel de la paix) et 97% des scientifiques s’entendent : nos émissions de carbone doivent avoir une limite. Si nous allons de l’avant avec Énergie Est - ou n’importe quel autre méga-oléoduc au service des sables bitumineux -, nous allons dépasser cette limite.
Les dernières recherches publiées dans la revue Nature confirment que nous devons laisser 85% du pétrole des sables bitumineux dans le sol si nous voulons éviter de déclencher un bouleversement climatique catastrophique et irréversible.
La puissance des mouvements sociaux, à l’Ouest et au Sud, a réussi à bloquer d’autres projets d’oléoducs, et c’est maintenant le temps de l’affrontement entre les compagnies d’oléoduc et la population du Québec.
Nous avons besoin de votre aide pour financer la résistance.





2015 est une année électorale, mais malgré le fait que les deux tiers de la population québécoise et la moitié de la population canadienne s’opposent à Énergie Est, les trois principaux partis fédéraux appuient le projet.
Y a-t-il quelque chose que nous n’avons pas compris? Car, ce qu’on nous a dit de la démocratie, c’est qu’il devrait y avoir au moins un parti pour représenter le point de vue de la moitié de la population.
Les libéraux aussi bien que le NPD ont changé plusieurs fois leur fusil d’épaule au sujet d’Énergie Est. De notre côté, nous croyons pouvoir exercer assez de pression sur l’un des partis, sinon les deux, pour lui faire changer de position avant la campagne électorale.
Il est temps de rehausser nos exigences à l’égard des gens que nous élisons. Il est temps d’exiger la démocratie.
Si vous faites un don dès aujourd’hui et en partageant ce vidéo autour de vous, nous allons utiliser cet argent pour nous assurer qu’aucun-e candidat-e ne pourra faire campagne au Québec sans être confronté-e à son hypocrisie au sujet des oléoducs.
En réussissant à faire changer la position ne serait-ce que d’un seul parti, cela pourrait transformer le futur de notre pays, voire de notre planète.
Alors, qu’attendez-vous?


Nous n’exigeons aucun frais d’adhésion, et plusieurs associations étudiantes québécoises peuvent se joindre à notre coalition et voter dans nos assemblées. Nous participons dans toute coalition plus large qui partage nos valeurs. Nous travaillons aux côtés des Premières Nations, de groupes communautaires, de syndicats, d’ONG environnementales et de n’importe qui d’autre qui partage une position claire contre Énergie Est.
Chaque dollar que nous recueillons au cours de cette campagne servira directement à la lutte contre Énergie Est : 

Nous utiliserons la désobéissance civile et des actions directes non-violentes pour exercer une pression sur les partis politiques et leurs candidat-e-s à tous les niveaux. Nous exigerons qu’ils et elles signent une déclaration formelle d’opposition à Énergie Est;
Nous mobiliserons la population étudiante dans le cadre de manifestations, en particulier lors de la manifestation Action Climat à Québec en avril;
Nous mettrons sur pied un réseau pancanadien d’opposition aux oléoducs sur les campus, afin de former les étudiant-e-s aux rouages de l’action directe autonome dans leurs communautés;
Nous ferons la promotion des actions de nos membres et nous nous assurerons que la voix étudiante du Québec soit bien représentée dans les médias;
Nous construirons une organisation permanente capable d’offrir une réaction étudiante rapide contre les oléoducs et les autres menaces climatiques.









Énergie Est abandonne aussi bien Justin Trudeau que Thomas Mulcair au gré du vent. Les deux appuient publiquement l’oléoduc, mais ils voudraient bien passer cela sous silence. Au Québec, où près des deux tiers de la population s’opposent à Énergie Est, les deux chefs ont beaucoup à perdre d’une campagne qui met l’accent sur leur appui à l’oléoduc.
Dans ces circonstances, nous croyons que nous pouvons exercer assez de pression pour forcer le PLC, le NPD ou les deux à changer leur position au sujet d’Énergie Est avant la campagne électorale.
Nous avons aussi quelques surprises en réserve pour Stephen Harper et son équipe, mais nous ne nous attendons pas à les faire changer d’idée.

Every dollar boosts this campaign's GoGo Factor (an algorithm that boost the campaign's ranking/visibility), and thus helps us reach more supporters.Remember,sharing this page helps just as much as contributing does.A very heartfelt thank you if you are visiting this page after the message our team had sent to you.The success of this fundraiser would be strong indicator that similar projects could be initiated anywhere in the world not just by big corporations, but by anyone with the vision and determination. Support a fossil fuel-free world.

We have made a prototype hive that can be hung in trees.  Our goal is to make this hive match a tree hollow as closely as possible.  At the same time we want to be able to monitor the tree hive colonies, take samples and record our progress.  Therefore the tree hive is a stack of wooden boxes with wooden frames hung inside much like standard beekeeping equipment.  The frames contain the bees' comb and can be removed, examined and replaced so that samples can be taken without breaking the comb.  The size of each box is about 1/3 of a standard beekeeping box so that a stack of three boxes for comb equals one standard box.  Beekeepers traditionally give their colonies two boxes therefore a tree hive is about half the size of a traditional beekeeping box.  A fourth box is placed under the boxes of comb, this is a box for wooden debris that may contain organisms.  Most colonies in a natural tree hollow have wood debris beneath the cavity that houses the bees.

 recently collaborated with Dr. Jay Yoder from Wittenberg University to 
conduct a study on fungi in honey bee colonies. (See the March 2015 
issue of Bee Culture for details.) The initial results suggest that tree

are encouraging! Further study is warranted.<br/><br/><h3>About Our Project</h3>It
 is absolutely critical that researchers, beekeepers, and the public

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Since 1978 Joyce Ferder Rankin has covered some of our planets most dangerous conflicts.  She has now set her sights on what could be the final battle for humanity; the effects of climate change. </p>
<p>Our planet is in a precarious state. Daily we hear of new tipping points in the disaster that is climate change.</p>
<p>Our team is traveling to the most remote parts of Antarctica to document the GREAT MELT which is estimated to ultimately raise sea levels by 10 meters/over 30 feet.</p>
<p>Fewer than 1000 people have ever been to some of the places that we are attempting to get to.</p>
<p>5 years ago Joyce set out on a journey to the ends of the earth. She felt a compulsion to find out what was happening in our planet’s polar circles – and to inform people about the truth of our global situation. She has been sharing her findings from her travels in Antarctica and the Arctic through multi-media exhibitions, speaking engagements (most recently TEDx), and a photographic book. </p>
<p>Now we need to finish the journey.  We are going to the ends of our earth, places where human beings rarely go to bring back the truth of what is happening to our planet and the catastrophic disaster we face if we don't act now.</p>

<p>The reality is, each year gets warmer, with record-setting temperatures.  On December 28, 2015, the temperature at the North Pole was 50F warmer than normal, due to a “freak” storm.</p>
<p>The 10,000-year-old Larsen Ice shelf has collapsed, and there are signs that Western Antarctica is also collapsing. This would raise sea levels by more than 30 feet.</p>
<p>Many climate scientists, including the renowned socio-biologist E.O. Wilson, say a mass extinction crisis -- on the order of the dinosaur’s demise 65 million ago -- is upon us.

<p>Climate scientists are in complete agreement: the tipping point for CO2 has been reached and exceeded, never to fall back to safe levels -- unless we take immediate and drastic action.</p>
<p>According to the Pentagon, there is no other situation on the planet as far reaching and dire to the USA than climate change.</p>
<p>In February 2017, Joyce Ferder-Rankin and our production team will journey to Antarctica to see first-hand if the Ross Ice Shelf and Western Antarctica are indeed experiencing the GREAT MELT.</p>

<h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>
<p>We're the farmers and founders of Apis Apotheca! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485295042/mv31gl5e6440yddj0sko.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>​Aviva Tilson has been farming since 2012 in New York and Vermont, on farms ranging from small diverse vegetables to a sheep dairy to a large biodynamic CSA and raw milk dairy.  She has struggled with health issues most of her life and started farming as a way to work through those challenges.  Her interest in medicinal herbs grew during her experience working at Hawthorne Valley Farm, and she decided to return to school at Arbor Vitae School for Traditional Herbalism in NYC to become certified as a Community Herbalist.  She and Ryan managed an intensively planted quarter acre medicinal herb farm and founded their herbal product company Apis Apotheca in 2016,and are excited to grow on a larger scale this season.  Her passion is growing plants that help heal people, as they have done for her.  </p>
<p>Ryan Surrano has had a life long love affair with plants since he was first introduced to his grandfathers garden, but has been farming professionally since 2013. He worked at a Wild Simulated Ginseng operation in the Catskill mountains for two seasons where he helped plant thousands of Ginseng seeds. There, he became interested in medicinal mushrooms and medicinal agroforestry.  He wants to grow high quality mushrooms and create spaces for endangered woodland medicinals to thrive.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485532979/wwzfspxnuezirlql3hlj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Annabel Roberts-McMichael is an artist, farmer and activist who graduated from Cooper Union and has worked on numerous farms in the Hudson Valley learning vegetable and herb production as well as biodynamic meat and dairy management.  She is avidly interested in agroforestry, forest based food systems, and traditional ecological knowledge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aviva, Annabel and Ryan are partnering with the beautiful people at GatherWild Ranch to grow good medicine on their fertile land. </p>
<h2>WHY DO HERBS MATTER?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We are living in uncertain times.</strong>  Our healthcare and our environment are daily threatened under the new administration, leaving people wondering what they can do to defend their health and the wellbeing of their communities.  <strong>We believe the answer lies in</strong> <strong>radical self-empowerment through learning how to use herbal medicine for basic preventative healthcare.  </strong>
</li>
<li> <strong>Herbs are the oldest, safest form of medicine.</strong>  They carry with them centuries of traditions that span cultures all over the world demonstrating their safety and efficacy. Peer reviewed scientific studies are now helping us understand the mechanisms behind herbs and their uses. <strong>The World Health Organization recently released a global strategy to incorporate traditional herbal medicine based healing modalities into member nation's plans for keeping their citizens healthy.  You can read about it here: <a href=""http://who.int/medicines/publications/traditional/trm_strategy14_23/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://who.int/medicines/publications/tradition...</a></strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Herbs are the people's medicine. </strong>Large pharmaceutical companies have profited greatly by the loss of traditional herbal memory in our culture, <strong>and it is time to reclaim our health from multinational conglomerates that profit from keeping us sick and dependent on them.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>HOW WILL OUR FARM HELP YOU?</h2>
<ul><li>We plan on offering <i>affordable </i><strong>APIS ELIXIR BOXES </strong>that will contain: <strong>1.</strong> A certain number of freshly dried seasonal, locally grown herbs, <strong>2. </strong>Empty vials, <strong>3. </strong>labels, and <strong>4. </strong>beautifully hand illustrated, collectible instructions on <strong>how to create YOUR OWN home apothecary to treat conditions including but not limited to: colds, insomnia, infections, a broken heart, skincare, and digestive complaints (all of which can be related!).</strong>  We want to grow high quality plants, and give you every tool you need to learn how to use them-- because <strong>to know how to heal yourself and your loved ones is an act of radical defiance and activism  in today's world.</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>​<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485824977/hnxk7lq3abyrarqwygbk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>We want our boxes to be accessible to anyone who needs one and is willing to get their kitchen witch on, and we plan on implementing a sliding scale policy for our medicine boxes as well as partnering with local CSA's whose missions are to serve low income communities.  Health shouldn't have a price tag that people can't afford.</b></li>
<li>
<strong>We plan on starting small and growing sustainably</strong>, with the goal of supplying retail and wholesale customers in the Hudson Valley and New York City metro area with fresh, local, vibrant medicinals that contain the life force needed to heal.</li>
<li>Last but not least, we are using land to grow plants which will <strong>sequester carbon</strong>, which needs to happen on a much larger scale if we are going to save our environment. <strong>We are environmental activists and farming is how we protest the destruction of our ecosystems and use our every breath to help preserve them.</strong>

We're the farmers and founders of Apis Apotheca! 

​Aviva Tilson has been farming since 2012 in New York and Vermont, on farms ranging from small diverse vegetables to a sheep dairy to a large biodynamic CSA and raw milk dairy.  She has struggled with health issues most of her life and started farming as a way to work through those challenges.  Her interest in medicinal herbs grew during her experience working at Hawthorne Valley Farm, and she decided to return to school at Arbor Vitae School for Traditional Herbalism in NYC to become certified as a Community Herbalist.  She and Ryan managed an intensively planted quarter acre medicinal herb farm and founded their herbal product company Apis Apotheca in 2016,and are excited to grow on a larger scale this season.  Her passion is growing plants that help heal people, as they have done for her.  
Ryan Surrano has had a life long love affair with plants since he was first introduced to his grandfathers garden, but has been farming professionally since 2013. He worked at a Wild Simulated Ginseng operation in the Catskill mountains for two seasons where he helped plant thousands of Ginseng seeds. There, he became interested in medicinal mushrooms and medicinal agroforestry.  He wants to grow high quality mushrooms and create spaces for endangered woodland medicinals to thrive.

Annabel Roberts-McMichael is an artist, farmer and activist who graduated from Cooper Union and has worked on numerous farms in the Hudson Valley learning vegetable and herb production as well as biodynamic meat and dairy management.  She is avidly interested in agroforestry, forest based food systems, and traditional ecological knowledge.
 
Aviva, Annabel and Ryan are partnering with the beautiful people at GatherWild Ranch to grow good medicine on their fertile land. 
WHY DO HERBS MATTER?


We are living in uncertain times.  Our healthcare and our environment are daily threatened under the new administration, leaving people wondering what they can do to defend their health and the wellbeing of their communities.  We believe the answer lies in radical self-empowerment through learning how to use herbal medicine for basic preventative healthcare.  

 Herbs are the oldest, safest form of medicine.  They carry with them centuries of traditions that span cultures all over the world demonstrating their safety and efficacy. Peer reviewed scientific studies are now helping us understand the mechanisms behind herbs and their uses. The World Health Organization recently released a global strategy to incorporate traditional herbal medicine based healing modalities into member nation's plans for keeping their citizens healthy.  You can read about it here: http://who.int/medicines/publications/tradition...


Herbs are the people's medicine. Large pharmaceutical companies have profited greatly by the loss of traditional herbal memory in our culture, and it is time to reclaim our health from multinational conglomerates that profit from keeping us sick and dependent on them.


HOW WILL OUR FARM HELP YOU?
We plan on offering affordable APIS ELIXIR BOXES that will contain: 1. A certain number of freshly dried seasonal, locally grown herbs, 2. Empty vials, 3. labels, and 4. beautifully hand illustrated, collectible instructions on how to create YOUR OWN home apothecary to treat conditions including but not limited to: colds, insomnia, infections, a broken heart, skincare, and digestive complaints (all of which can be related!).  We want to grow high quality plants, and give you every tool you need to learn how to use them-- because to know how to heal yourself and your loved ones is an act of radical defiance and activism  in today's world.

​

We want our boxes to be accessible to anyone who needs one and is willing to get their kitchen witch on, and we plan on implementing a sliding scale policy for our medicine boxes as well as partnering with local CSA's whose missions are to serve low income communities.  Health shouldn't have a price tag that people can't afford.

We plan on starting small and growing sustainably, with the goal of supplying retail and wholesale customers in the Hudson Valley and New York City metro area with fresh, local, vibrant medicinals that contain the life force needed to heal.
Last but not least, we are using land to grow plants which will sequester carbon, which needs to happen on a much larger scale if we are going to save our environment. We are environmental activists and farming is how we protest the destruction of our ecosystems and use our every breath to help preserve them.


WHAT WE NEED TO GET STARTED
We are asking for $15,500 for start up costs which will go towards funding:

Packaging and printing costs for Apis Elixir Boxes
Fencing (there's a lotta deer up here)
Irrigation 
Handtools
A small greenhouse
A temperature controlled herb drying shed
A tractor mounted mulch layer
Mulch
Seeds
Seed Starter Soil
Compost
Row Cover
Seed Trays


What do you get?
These are some of our offerings to thank you for your support and commitment to ensuring the health of our communities:


Seeds! : ""They wanted to bury us- they didn't know we were seeds"".  This proverb is more important than ever, and our medicinal herb seed packets will help you start growing your own medicine!

Apis Apotheca Skincare trio: Get the original line of high quality herbal skincare that we launched our company with! Includes a Whole Plant Infused moisturizer, exfoliant, and toner mist to help transform your skin for the better.  

Apis Elixir Box: An innovative complete wellness kit filled with herbs, bottles, and collectible artist-illustrated instructions so you can get started on your own journey as a medicine maker

A Personal Herbal Consultation: Have a talk with community Herbalist Aviva in person or over skype to discuss your health goals and how to achieve them with plant allies. You'll receive a customized Apis Elixir Box.

A Wild Medicinals Foraging Walk and Workshop: We'll go for a walk and learn how to identify some of the best, most common wild medicinals to use for food and skincare, and craft a meal and medicine from them together!  A great small group or one-on-one learning experience! 

Impact

By helping us get started, you will be helping yourself and your communities to become more self sufficient and self reliant.  
Your support will enable us to preserve and enrich our local ecology and sequester carbon in the atmosphere.  Every small step counts towards preserving our planet, and our farm will be a living example of how we all might work together to preserve our water, soil, and air from further industrial contamination.  
We already have in depth experience in organic farming, agroforestry and small business management, and are part of a close network of young farmers in the Hudson Valley that share knowledge and help each other succeed.

<h3>15 Million Ghanaians Still Need Access to Safe Sanitation</h3>
<p>There are millions of Ghanaians who are in dire need of access to safe sanitation. At Loo Works our business is centered around providing safe sanitation for all. Safe sanitation for the low income population must also be off-grid as most of the areas they live in are not connected to water. We offer an off-grid solution that is appealing to the population we aim to serve. Our Superstructures are then connected to an odor-free digester, a biological waste management system, which does not need to be dislodged often. This pairing offers a quick and sustainable solution to the neediest in our population. </p>
<ul>
<li>Our models use stainless steel, aluminum and or cement fiber board to create a toilet housing.</li>
<li>Each model contains a full flush toilet along with a handwash basin. We will offer micro-flush options for highwater areas (mid 2018).</li>
<li>These models are ideal for areas with limited space but not suitable for high traffic areas. Our public toilets will be specifically designed for public use</li>
<li>Our toilets come preassembled and can be installed in a few hours on site.</li>
<li>When paired with a digester, this household toilet system is odor-free and is completely off-grid. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why do we need $500K?</h3>
<p>Sourcing sustainable raw materials for our structures in Ghana is our goal, but for now we must import our product. We are raising money to push our production further, this first round push towards #1000Toiletsin1Y will simply be a foundation on which we can build a sustainable model. We have already made a name for ourselves as a provider of choice in this market, but we want to improve our impact. That means $250,000 will go towards our supply of the 1000 toilets while $100,000 will be used to develop the foundation of our first local manufacturing facility, including machinery, training, and marketing materials. In addition, we need $75,000 to move our team of 5 to a team of 60 who will be our sanitation care specialists for our households. As with any new technology, we need training, so these care specialists will assist households with user sensitization, use instructions, smooth installation, troubleshooting and maintenance and overall service as they move from open defecation to safe sanitation practices. $40,000 will be used to develop a prototype for the upcoming locally developed toilet model so we can provide a sustainable low-cost option for those most in need within our population. $25,000 will be used to incorporate a financing mechanism that will allow members of the low-income population to utilize a micro-lending or small scale savings plan towards their future sanitation needs well after this first 1000 has been delivered.  In the case that our goal is not met, we will work to get our local factory up and running so we can provide a long-term sustainable toilet option.</p>
<h3>Our Loo Works Story</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Four years ago, after spending a majority of her life in the United States, our Founder, Samlara moved back to Ghana to be closer to her family. She was shocked to find out how deplorable the sanitation conditions were throughout the country but most especially in extremely populated areas. She discovered that open defecation was still quite prevalent and that most public toilets were completely unsanitary pay-per-use toilets that the bottom of the pyramid were using daily as their home toilets! </p>
<p>This set her on a quest to find a solution, locally she discovered that Biofilcom, had an off-grid digester that could be used virtually anywhere. After two years of research and working within the sanitation sector, Loo Works had a toilet housing on the market that could be easily assembled and provide a dignified toilet to those in need. </p>
<p>After six months of installations Loo Works is now in 75 households in Greater Accra but in order to make a real impact, we need your help! The demand is extremely high but we must be able to find a way to get the toilets in households while allowing households a lengthy amount of time (years in some cases) to pay. #1000Toiletsin1Y will be a foundation upon which we can build. </p>

 I was Wall Street's first environmentalist stockbroker in the 1970s, an
 IT consultant to New York City's largest banks and IBM in the 1980s, 
then went from tech to teaching in the 1990s.  I literally quit my day 
job as a university instructor in 2008 to focus full-time on fixing the 
climate problem, and went to where I thought change was most likely to 
come from, the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, known as the COP, or 
Conference of Parties to the Kyoto Protocols.What
 I found was simultaneously hopeful and discouraging, inspiring and 
depressing.  The negotiations were a diplomatic battle between those who
 want to protect the future of humanity and life on Earth, and those 
intent upon making money at all cost, and preserving Business-As-Usual.  It was a modern day tragedy in the making. Since
 then I have focus intensely upon the systemic contradictions within 
society and the individual human psyche that are hurtling us toward a 
collision with Nature.  My work is now to catalyze an understanding of 
the epic battle for the future of civilization and life on Earth that is
 called 'the COP.'Fixing the Climate Crisis from HollywoodChristian Meoli is our Producer.  His company, Voltaire Media, specializes

</p><p>Hey, I have
one thing that makes me lie sleepless at nights and that is that our earth is
going in to the six mass extinction in its history. That is a trend that I want
to change, so I went to Southeast Asia one of the most species rich areas in
the world and the area where species are the most threatened, to do something. <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>In my
search in Southeast Asia I found a company Tianzi that is working on a completely
different way to use agriculture, it´s called agroforestry. When I came to
Tianzi 2012 in Xishuangbanna , south of China they have undergone tragic
events, since the co-creator Josef Margraf had passed away and there been a
huge forest fire that destroyed much of theirs agroforestry, but Tianzi
survived and is keeping up the battle to save species. This is done in one of the most biodiversity rich areas in the world where you could find Tiger, Gibbons, Clouded Leopard, Rhinos, Dhole and many more and if nothing is done it can also lose Elephants, Leopard and Gaur. They work close to Laos and Myanmar, where many species still live so its a high probability for those species to come back if we do something now.<br/></p>
<p>The method
Tianzi use agroforestry you search for a way to mimic the natural ecosystem or
now rainforest and still produce food.<span>  Then
it hit me that this is what I want to dedicate my life to. Because agriculture
is one of the crucial reasons of why species are dying out, since it often in
monoculture that are one of the largest releases of greenhouse gas (30% of the
global emissions), take around 70 % of all freshwater, biggest emissions of
nitrogen and phosphor, soil degradation and destroying ecosystem since it cover
around 40 % of the earth lands. So instead of monoculture if our agriculture would
be like agroforestry it would help store greenhouse gases and freshwater, as
well as clean the freshwater, no nitrogen or phosphor emission that cause eutrophication
and it would works as a ecosystem that many species can live in harmony with
the communities. </span></p>
<p>So now I
wonder how I can support them and then I realized one methods that I study on
in my environmental Bachelor and that is biochar. Biochar is an ancient method
that was used by the indigenous people of the Amazon for several thousand years
ago. It has been rediscovered for several year and scientist are amazed of its
qualities. It´s starting to get used now, but only in small scale since its hard to compete with fertilizer, that not takes responsibility for it´s consequences on the nature as eutrophication. Biochar is often even much better but a higher first time cost. Compare to none treated soil it shows 2-3 times higher nitrogen and
4-5 times higher phosphor levels, increase the soil water storage capacities,
the nutrient are more easily accessible to plants and it is able to store large
amount of carbondioxxid around 450 tons/ hectare. Since the soil often is low on nutrition
in rainforest this is very important. </p>
<p>So I
thought that this would be a great way to solve many of our earth problem, to
name a few loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystem, development for poor
communities and tackle climate change. To help save species this could work as spreading
corridor and buffer zone for national parks, in an addition as agroforestry
create habitat for wildlife. Would I use this combination to convert all rubber
plantation in Southeast Asia then I would store around 3 % of 2010 CO<sub>2</sub>
global emissions. </p>
<p>So with

</div>","Hey, I have
one thing that makes me lie sleepless at nights and that is that our earth is
going in to the six mass extinction in its history. That is a trend that I want
to change, so I went to Southeast Asia one of the most species rich areas in
the world and the area where species are the most threatened, to do something. In my
search in Southeast Asia I found a company Tianzi that is working on a completely
different way to use agriculture, it´s called agroforestry. When I came to
Tianzi 2012 in Xishuangbanna , south of China they have undergone tragic
events, since the co-creator Josef Margraf had passed away and there been a
huge forest fire that destroyed much of theirs agroforestry, but Tianzi
survived and is keeping up the battle to save species. This is done in one of the most biodiversity rich areas in the world where you could find Tiger, Gibbons, Clouded Leopard, Rhinos, Dhole and many more and if nothing is done it can also lose Elephants, Leopard and Gaur. They work close to Laos and Myanmar, where many species still live so its a high probability for those species to come back if we do something now.
The method
Tianzi use agroforestry you search for a way to mimic the natural ecosystem or
now rainforest and still produce food.  Then
it hit me that this is what I want to dedicate my life to. Because agriculture
is one of the crucial reasons of why species are dying out, since it often in
monoculture that are one of the largest releases of greenhouse gas (30% of the
global emissions), take around 70 % of all freshwater, biggest emissions of
nitrogen and phosphor, soil degradation and destroying ecosystem since it cover
around 40 % of the earth lands. So instead of monoculture if our agriculture would
be like agroforestry it would help store greenhouse gases and freshwater, as
well as clean the freshwater, no nitrogen or phosphor emission that cause eutrophication
and it would works as a ecosystem that many species can live in harmony with
the communities. 
So now I
wonder how I can support them and then I realized one methods that I study on
in my environmental Bachelor and that is biochar. Biochar is an ancient method
that was used by the indigenous people of the Amazon for several thousand years
ago. It has been rediscovered for several year and scientist are amazed of its
qualities. It´s starting to get used now, but only in small scale since its hard to compete with fertilizer, that not takes responsibility for it´s consequences on the nature as eutrophication. Biochar is often even much better but a higher first time cost. Compare to none treated soil it shows 2-3 times higher nitrogen and
4-5 times higher phosphor levels, increase the soil water storage capacities,
the nutrient are more easily accessible to plants and it is able to store large
amount of carbondioxxid around 450 tons/ hectare. Since the soil often is low on nutrition
in rainforest this is very important. 
So I
thought that this would be a great way to solve many of our earth problem, to
name a few loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystem, development for poor
communities and tackle climate change. To help save species this could work as spreading
corridor and buffer zone for national parks, in an addition as agroforestry
create habitat for wildlife. Would I use this combination to convert all rubber
plantation in Southeast Asia then I would store around 3 % of 2010 CO2
global emissions. 
So with
your help I want to start a company the store large amount of carbon with
biochar and agroforestry, as well save species like Tiger, Rhinos, Gibbon and many more and also develop rural poor areas for
start in Southeast Asia and continue too other rainforest around the world.

<h3>The Funding...</h3>
<p>We are asking for $25,000 to fully fund our project. The funding will be primarily used for the custom mold required of the 3 sizes of bowls to be available. Once the molds are complete, there are set-up fees and minimum order quantities to fulfill. We have calculated all of the numbers using current plastic costs and quotes for manufacturing the molds. The remaining funds will go to working with a co-op food packaging facility to retrofit their existing machines to accommodate our products.</p>
<p>In the past, Barkem’s Portable Pet Meals™ required a much higher investment amount to be able to purchase the packing, fulfillment and sealing machines required to produce our product.

Purchasing these machines to a tune of $100,000 was not a reasonable business model for the Company. </p>
<p>Blink Blink... the light bulb upstairs turned on! We can use a ""commissary Kitchen"" (locations that allow rental by the hour, or by the day providing kitchens, packaging machines, and more all with a FDA certification).We decided it only made sense to let the pro’s handle the manufacturing and packaging of our product. Our BarkEm’s team will focus on promotion, fulfillment and company operations. The co-op packaging facility will have in place the certifications required to package pet food, such as FDA and AAFCO, thus saving our Company time, money and resources. </p>

<div>
<p>Since 1978, the sloop <em><em><em>Woody Guthrie</em></em></em> has given thousands of people their first experience on a sailboat and their first experience of the beauties of the Hudson River and the surrounding mountains from the vantage point of her deck completely free. All they have to do was call for a reservation or come aboard at one of our riverside festivals or community events.</p>
<p>The Woody Guthrie is a 46 foot gaff-rigged, traditional wooden sailboat similar in vintage to the sloop Clearwater (which is a replica of the 18th and 19th century sailboats that carried passengers and goods up and down the river from NYC to Albany and all points in between). The Woody is an open cockpit friendship sloop, capable of carrying a full crew and 12 guests comfortably.  Smaller than the sloops that sailed up and down the river, the Woody is a replica of a Hudson River Ferry Sloop, that ferried folks and cargo from one side of the river to the other.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Does The Woody Do?</h3>
<p>The Woody Guthrie is the flagship of the Beacon Sloop Club, which is an all-volunteer, non-profit organization formed in 1969 to support and promote the mission of the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater and make the river accessable to everyone. We try to focus on local concerns and activities while maintaining a view of how we are part of the larger world. In order to do this we have adopted the following as our mission:</p>
<p>* To Preserve. restore and celebrate the Hudson River and surrounding waterways.</p>
<p>* To promote and encourage interest in sound ecological practices affecting the Hudson River and its environs.</p>
<p>* To organize and arrange associated recreational activities such as concerts, festivals and other community gatherings on the waterfront of Beacon, New York.</p>
<p>* To promote interest in sailing and foster good fellowship and safety in boating: to encourage the sport of boating: to promote the science of seamanship and navigation, and provide access to information and training in the skills and techniques thereof: and to provide and maintain a suitable clubhouse and anchorage for the use and recreation of its members.</p>
<p>The Beacon Sloop Club owns and operates several sailboats and offers both on-the-water training and “Learn to Sail” classes. Our largest boat is the Hudson River Ferry Sloop Woody Guthrie.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.wheresthewoody.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/quadricentennial-1-2.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""quadricentennial-1-2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wheresthewoody.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/quadricentennial-1-2-272x300.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>Since the launch in 1978 the “Woody Guthrie”, has carried approximately 1,500 guests each season! It is sailed by an all-volunteer captain and crew, and every guest rides for free.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2013, after over 35 years of providing a secure, safe, free Hudson River sailing experience to tens of thousands of guests, we had the boat professionally surveyed and determined that in order to maintain our high standards  of safety for our guests and our volunteers, our beloved boat would need to undergo major repairs.</p>
<p>It has taken our organization (the Beacon Sloop Club) over a year to determine the extent of the work necessary and the proper course of action to get that work done.</p>
<p>35 years of sailing on the Hudson River (and beyond), sometimes in salt water, but mostly in fresh water, and spending every winter on the hard (hauled out on land), has taken a heavy toll on our fair boat.</p>
<p>In fresh water, wood rots, cracks, warps, and just plain ages. Exposed to salt water, iron and steel components and fasteners corrode and weaken.</p>
<p>For its entire lifespan, the ‘Woody Guthrie” has been maintained, repaired, and refreshed mostly by volunteers, using funds provided by the Beacon Sloop Club, but the scope of this undertaking is too large for this approach.</p>
<p>WHAT we need now, is help!  In the form of contributions, large and small, by folks such as yourself who want to see the good work of this fine vessel continue.  Please help us reach our goal of a fully restored “Woody Guthrie"".</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Where's The Woody?</h3>
<p>The Beacon Sloop Club is in the home stretch of a multi-year fundraising effort to replace the original ribs and many planks to allow the Woody to continue to sail and take guests out onto the river for another 35 or more years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the main inspirations for Pete Seeger to have the Woody Guthrie built was his idea that a beautiful, wooden sailboat, such as the ones often depicted in many Hudson River School paintings and prints, if it belonged to the community, would bring together a very diverse group of folks that would be willing to work together in order to sail her, and keep her going, (He once referred to the Woody as the “cheese in the trap”) and that is exactly what has been the 37 year history of this boat. By working together, and sailing together, very different segments of the local population have become a “community” and we are all the richer for it.</p>
<p>If you contribute to this effort, you will be investing in the future…..of this boat, this community, and the health of the Hudson River. You will be investing in yourselves.</p>
<p>Please contribute what you can to help keep providing free sails on the Hudson river! Your donation is tax-deductible since we are registered non-profit. </p>

</div></div>","What Is The Woody Guthrie?

Since 1978, the sloop Woody Guthrie has given thousands of people their first experience on a sailboat and their first experience of the beauties of the Hudson River and the surrounding mountains from the vantage point of her deck completely free. All they have to do was call for a reservation or come aboard at one of our riverside festivals or community events.
The Woody Guthrie is a 46 foot gaff-rigged, traditional wooden sailboat similar in vintage to the sloop Clearwater (which is a replica of the 18th and 19th century sailboats that carried passengers and goods up and down the river from NYC to Albany and all points in between). The Woody is an open cockpit friendship sloop, capable of carrying a full crew and 12 guests comfortably.  Smaller than the sloops that sailed up and down the river, the Woody is a replica of a Hudson River Ferry Sloop, that ferried folks and cargo from one side of the river to the other.

What Does The Woody Do?
The Woody Guthrie is the flagship of the Beacon Sloop Club, which is an all-volunteer, non-profit organization formed in 1969 to support and promote the mission of the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater and make the river accessable to everyone. We try to focus on local concerns and activities while maintaining a view of how we are part of the larger world. In order to do this we have adopted the following as our mission:
* To Preserve. restore and celebrate the Hudson River and surrounding waterways.
* To promote and encourage interest in sound ecological practices affecting the Hudson River and its environs.
* To organize and arrange associated recreational activities such as concerts, festivals and other community gatherings on the waterfront of Beacon, New York.
* To promote interest in sailing and foster good fellowship and safety in boating: to encourage the sport of boating: to promote the science of seamanship and navigation, and provide access to information and training in the skills and techniques thereof: and to provide and maintain a suitable clubhouse and anchorage for the use and recreation of its members.
The Beacon Sloop Club owns and operates several sailboats and offers both on-the-water training and “Learn to Sail” classes. Our largest boat is the Hudson River Ferry Sloop Woody Guthrie.

Since the launch in 1978 the “Woody Guthrie”, has carried approximately 1,500 guests each season! It is sailed by an all-volunteer captain and crew, and every guest rides for free.
In the fall of 2013, after over 35 years of providing a secure, safe, free Hudson River sailing experience to tens of thousands of guests, we had the boat professionally surveyed and determined that in order to maintain our high standards  of safety for our guests and our volunteers, our beloved boat would need to undergo major repairs.
It has taken our organization (the Beacon Sloop Club) over a year to determine the extent of the work necessary and the proper course of action to get that work done.
35 years of sailing on the Hudson River (and beyond), sometimes in salt water, but mostly in fresh water, and spending every winter on the hard (hauled out on land), has taken a heavy toll on our fair boat.
In fresh water, wood rots, cracks, warps, and just plain ages. Exposed to salt water, iron and steel components and fasteners corrode and weaken.
For its entire lifespan, the ‘Woody Guthrie” has been maintained, repaired, and refreshed mostly by volunteers, using funds provided by the Beacon Sloop Club, but the scope of this undertaking is too large for this approach.
WHAT we need now, is help!  In the form of contributions, large and small, by folks such as yourself who want to see the good work of this fine vessel continue.  Please help us reach our goal of a fully restored “Woody Guthrie"".

Where's The Woody?
The Beacon Sloop Club is in the home stretch of a multi-year fundraising effort to replace the original ribs and many planks to allow the Woody to continue to sail and take guests out onto the river for another 35 or more years.

One of the main inspirations for Pete Seeger to have the Woody Guthrie built was his idea that a beautiful, wooden sailboat, such as the ones often depicted in many Hudson River School paintings and prints, if it belonged to the community, would bring together a very diverse group of folks that would be willing to work together in order to sail her, and keep her going, (He once referred to the Woody as the “cheese in the trap”) and that is exactly what has been the 37 year history of this boat. By working together, and sailing together, very different segments of the local population have become a “community” and we are all the richer for it.
If you contribute to this effort, you will be investing in the future…..of this boat, this community, and the health of the Hudson River. You will be investing in yourselves.
Please contribute what you can to help keep providing free sails on the Hudson river! Your donation is tax-deductible since we are registered non-profit.

<h3>Red Wagon Goats</h3>
<p>We are Red Wagon Goats, a goat rental for land remediation business owned and operated by Decatur residents Megan Kibby and Jason Lewis. Jason is the goat expert, along with being a craftsman, climber, slack liner and animal enthusiast. Megan is a graphic designer and marketer, who also teaches yoga and performs burlesque. </p>
<p>So many people have been coming to us, ready to rent some goats, but there are a few ducks we need to get in a row before we can help Atlanta get OFF chemicals and ON goats: that's where YOU come in. You can donate any amount you want to contribute to a chemical free community, but we've offered some perks we think you'll love to say thank you for your support.</p>
<p>(You may opt out of perks if you'd like your entire donation to go to the fundraiser. ANY donation of $50 or more, whether for a perk or not is invited to join us for our Meet &amp; Greet Launch Party.)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We've got goats, but there's a LOT we need in order to bring these guys to the community:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>More Goats</strong>. Bobby McGee and family are a great start, but if we are going to meet our customers' needs, we will need to grow the herd!  </li>
<li>
<strong>Transport</strong>. While crates in the back of a pick up truck may be fine for just a few goats, we are growing and our transportation needs to grow too. The biggest, most expensive item we need is a live stock trailer. If we don't reach our entire goal, we will still be going into business, but we might be making LOTS of trips to get the whole heard from place to place. If we exceed our goal, we would like to invest in an electric or hybrid vehicle for towing our transportation, so that we can be as sustainable as possible. </li>
<li>
<strong>Fencing &amp; Dwelling</strong>. We need portable electric fencing so that we can keep these guys safe from predators and escape when they do their traveling. If we reach our goal, we will be able to not only give them electric fencing, but portable covered shelter to stay dry and happy.</li>
<li>
<strong>Guardian/Herd Dogs</strong>. We need trained dogs to protect the herd from predators and help us manage the goats during transportation. </li>
<li>
<strong>Equipment</strong>. We want the finished results to be great—we assist the goats in their landscaping duties. They clear the big stuff, and we do the fine tuning. We also need to be able to clear undesirable, toxic plants before the goats can come. </li>
<li>
<strong>Vet Care</strong>. Goats require pretty minimal veterinary care as pets, but once they start ""working"" they tend to need more care, and we'd like to be able to get them certified.</li>
<li>
<strong>Start Up Costs</strong>. Name reservation. Insurance. Operations. Website. Marketing: it's going to take a lot to get our name out there and spread the word, so we will need advertising and paid social media campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Mission Statement</strong></h3>
<p><i>Red Wagon Goats is a company made up of fun-loving (but hard-working) goats and the humans that love them. We offer a sustainable and rewarding approach to clearing and managing overgrown landscapes. Our promise is to provide excellent care to our goats; quality service and affordable solutions to our community; to do our part in leaving a healthy environment for future generations to inherit; and to be good stewards of our planet. </i></p>

<h3>Who is a good candidate for land clearing?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Residential, commercial and rural land that is overgrown</li>
<li>Land that is covered in unwanted brush, tall grass, weeds, leaves, invasive species, english ivy, poison ivy, poison sumac and kudzu</li>
<li>Land that has not recently been sprayed with chemical pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers </li>
<li>Land that is not abundant with azaleas, rhododendrons, nandina or other toxic species (although we can remove prior to the goats arrival, or build electric fencing around it as a workaround) </li>
<li>As goats will eat almost anything in sight, highly landscaped areas where desirable plants are abundant may not be appropriate </li>
<li>A fence is great but not required. For anyone with a fence shorter than 5 feet, we will install electric fencing</li>
<li>People looking to keep themselves, their children, pets and gardens safe from harmful chemicals<br/> </li>
</ul>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Visit our website (coming soon!) and fill out the application. </li>
<li>We'll be in touch soon to set up a consultation. The $50 consultation fee is applied to the cost of service. </li>
<li>We will come out and check out your land and talk through your needs so that we can provide you with a custom estimate. </li>
<li>We will do any prep work required – any landscaping that needs to be done by hand ahead of time, such as removing unwanted toxic plants like nandina. We will set up electric fencing if you have no fence or a short fence, or plants you would like protected. </li>
<li>We will bring the goats to you! Trip time for a typical yard is 1–2 weeks. </li>
<li>While they're there, we will come out and check on them regularly. You can save money by opting to provide water and food daily. </li>
<li>Once your land is clear, we will bring the goats home and do any finishing touches needed, and we'll provide you with a survey to let us know what we did well and what we can improve. </li>

<h3>Environmental &amp; Health Impact</h3>
<p>We don't want to alarm you, but there is a large community of scientists studying the effects of lawn and agricultural chemicals. Here are some studies we found that inspired us to help people get OFF chemicals: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cancer in Humans</strong>. A review of 44 scientific studies found that exposure to glysphosate (the main ingredient in herbicides like RoundUp) doubles farmers' risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The study authors theorize that Roundup disrupts the normal functioning of white blood cells, throwing an immune system into a sickened, dysfunctional state (source: <a href=""http://www.rodalesorganiclife.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rodalesorganiclife.com</a>)<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Pet Cancer</strong>. <p>An article in <i>Abstract of Environmental Health 112(1): 171-6</i> (Jan. 2012), shows a link between lawn chemicals and cancer in dogs.  Scientists found that dogs with malignant lymphoma were 70% more likely to live in a home where professionally applied lawn pesticides had been used. Dogs with serious malignancy were also 170% more likely to come from homes where owners used chemical insecticides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>It's in the air.</strong> Each year, nonorganic farmers dump millions of pounds of Roundup on food crops. The levels are so excessive, that the federal scientists recently detected the weed killer in the air and rain.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Health issues</strong>. Exposure to Roundup could potentially alter your hormones, leading to obesity, heart problems, and diabetes, according to Warren Porter, PhD, professor of environmental toxicology and zoology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, based on data collected by the United States Geological Survey.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Your garden</strong>. Run off of herbicides into your garden can affect the fruit and vegetables you grow, which can in turn affect your gut health. Glyphosate is registered as an antimicrobial agent in the U.S. because it can wipe out a wide variety of pathogenic organisms, including protective microorganisms in the gut. These are needed to fight off harmful pathogens like Clostridium botulinum, Salmonella, and E. coli, to combat ""leaky gut,"" where the protective gut lining is compromised, allowing bacteria and toxins to escape into your bloodstream, and for proper absorption of nutrients (key in brain development). <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Butterflies</strong>. Researchers at Iowa State University found that the heavy use of glyphosate has resulted in an 81 percent decrease in the monarch butterfly population. Traditionally, milkweed—the plants monarchs need to reproduce and survive as a species (not butterfly bush)—would rebound after farmers used cultivation to kill weeds, but chemical interventions wipe the plant out.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Honeybees</strong>. <font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The National Agriculture Statistics Service has reported a drop in numbers from more than 5 million to less than 2.5 million honeybees, but pesticides are not the only </span>culprit. </font><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">A new study shows that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, can disrupt learning behaviors in honeybees and severely impair long-term colony performance.</span><br/> </li>
<li>
<b>Toxicity for unborn</b>. In 2009, French researchers published a scientific paper in the journal <i>Chemical Research in Toxicology</i> showing that low levels of four glyphosate formulations used in Roundup—levels far below what's allowed in agriculture; levels on par with what's in our food—all kill human umbilical, embryonic, and placental cells within 24 hours.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Roundup Isn't Effective</strong>. Abusing Roundup has fueled the emergence of nearly impossible-to-kill superweeds.Genetically engineering crop seeds to live through herbicide sprayings that would normally kill the crop is a failed technology and a losing battle. Just as overusing antibiotics led to hard-to-kill, antibiotic-resistant supergerms. </li>

<h3>Goats are incredible animals</h3>
<p>Here are some fun facts about goats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Goats were one of the first animals to be tamed by humans.</li>
<li>Goats are herd animals and will become depressed and feel unsafe if kept without any goat companions. </li>
<li>Goats’ pupils are rectangular and horizontal. This gives them vision for 320 to 340 degrees (compared to humans with 160-210) around them without having to move and they are thought to have excellent night vision. </li>
<li>Goats are browsers, NOT grazers. They don't stay in one spot for too long, they move around looking for new and exciting vegetation to try. </li>
<li>Goats have four “stomachs.” Their food moves first into the rumen (from which it is periodically regurgitated for more “cud chewing”), then to the reticulum, later to the omasum, and finally to the abomasum.<br/> </li>

<li>

Also, potentially donating our time to schools and children' programs to help spread the love of goats and sustainable practices. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Gardening &amp; Outdoor Construction</strong>. The whole reason we got goats was to have a safe, enjoyable outdoor space and an organic garden. We eventually want to help other people with their outdoor spaces – from beautiful fencing, to garden construction and consultation—even tree houses and ponds, the long term goal is that we are a team with the goats to create great outdoor spaces. </li>

</div></div>","Red Wagon Goats
We are Red Wagon Goats, a goat rental for land remediation business owned and operated by Decatur residents Megan Kibby and Jason Lewis. Jason is the goat expert, along with being a craftsman, climber, slack liner and animal enthusiast. Megan is a graphic designer and marketer, who also teaches yoga and performs burlesque. 
So many people have been coming to us, ready to rent some goats, but there are a few ducks we need to get in a row before we can help Atlanta get OFF chemicals and ON goats: that's where YOU come in. You can donate any amount you want to contribute to a chemical free community, but we've offered some perks we think you'll love to say thank you for your support.
(You may opt out of perks if you'd like your entire donation to go to the fundraiser. ANY donation of $50 or more, whether for a perk or not is invited to join us for our Meet & Greet Launch Party.)
 

What We Need
We've got goats, but there's a LOT we need in order to bring these guys to the community:


More Goats. Bobby McGee and family are a great start, but if we are going to meet our customers' needs, we will need to grow the herd!  

Transport. While crates in the back of a pick up truck may be fine for just a few goats, we are growing and our transportation needs to grow too. The biggest, most expensive item we need is a live stock trailer. If we don't reach our entire goal, we will still be going into business, but we might be making LOTS of trips to get the whole heard from place to place. If we exceed our goal, we would like to invest in an electric or hybrid vehicle for towing our transportation, so that we can be as sustainable as possible. 

Fencing & Dwelling. We need portable electric fencing so that we can keep these guys safe from predators and escape when they do their traveling. If we reach our goal, we will be able to not only give them electric fencing, but portable covered shelter to stay dry and happy.

Guardian/Herd Dogs. We need trained dogs to protect the herd from predators and help us manage the goats during transportation. 

Equipment. We want the finished results to be great—we assist the goats in their landscaping duties. They clear the big stuff, and we do the fine tuning. We also need to be able to clear undesirable, toxic plants before the goats can come. 

Vet Care. Goats require pretty minimal veterinary care as pets, but once they start ""working"" they tend to need more care, and we'd like to be able to get them certified.

Start Up Costs. Name reservation. Insurance. Operations. Website. Marketing: it's going to take a lot to get our name out there and spread the word, so we will need advertising and paid social media campaigns.

 
Mission Statement
Red Wagon Goats is a company made up of fun-loving (but hard-working) goats and the humans that love them. We offer a sustainable and rewarding approach to clearing and managing overgrown landscapes. Our promise is to provide excellent care to our goats; quality service and affordable solutions to our community; to do our part in leaving a healthy environment for future generations to inherit; and to be good stewards of our planet. 
 

Who is a good candidate for land clearing?

Residential, commercial and rural land that is overgrown
Land that is covered in unwanted brush, tall grass, weeds, leaves, invasive species, english ivy, poison ivy, poison sumac and kudzu
Land that has not recently been sprayed with chemical pesticides, herbicides or fertilizers 
Land that is not abundant with azaleas, rhododendrons, nandina or other toxic species (although we can remove prior to the goats arrival, or build electric fencing around it as a workaround) 
As goats will eat almost anything in sight, highly landscaped areas where desirable plants are abundant may not be appropriate 
A fence is great but not required. For anyone with a fence shorter than 5 feet, we will install electric fencing
People looking to keep themselves, their children, pets and gardens safe from harmful chemicals

Once your land is clear, we will bring the goats home and do any finishing touches needed, and we'll provide you with a survey to let us know what we did well and what we can improve. 
With continued use of the goats, ivy and other undesirable plants will experience ""shock"" with no available photosynthesis and growth will eventually subside.

<h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">HERE'S THE FINE PRINT:</span></h2>
</div>
<div>
<br/>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">In Indonesia, Oceans Care and Bluewater Cruises are bringing a hydro-solar powered trash wheel to the Jangkuk River in Lombok- the island's largest river located 200 meters from the Indian Ocean. The trash wheel was created by U.S. company Clearwater Mills and has proven to be a resounding success in Baltimore, Maryland - where it has intercepted over 354 tons of trash flowing in Jones Falls River from emptying into the Atlantic Ocean. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Our aim is to revitalize the riverbed in Ampenan, Lombok, into a natural river park - creating a community hub of recreation and business, using the sustainable technology of the waterwheel trash interceptor to clean the river and keep the trash from flowing into the ocean. We are modeling our vision off of the proven success in Baltimore, where their Inner Harbor has been revitalized as a place of community and tourism, while providing education, awareness, and stewardship of their waterways. </span><br/></p>
<p><span>In addition to the implementation of a trash wheel, we will also be working to educate the local community in Lombok about the devastation of our oceans and working together to promote a working system of waste management. 

The wheel will collect the trash, in the most volume during storm surges, emptying it into a large dumpster. There is already a road at the projected site of Jangkuk River's future trash wheel, which will allow for easy access of transporting the trash. Each container will be brought to a dump in Lombok, where it will be sorted and studied, just like in Baltimore. </span></p>
<p><span>We hope to take this project  one step further by partnering with companies and artisans, who are focused on re-purposing this waste into raw materials for production of goods - fabrics, baskets, bags, lamps, etc. 

Although this project in based in a solitary river and town on a single island, we believe that this model can inspire the rest of Southeast Asia and the world to incorporate this system of technology and education to begin cleaning our collective waterways - deterring littering and catching the waste before it goes into the ocean. </span><br/></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">WHAT'S THE $100,000 FOR EXACTLY?</span></h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are using the money raised on Indiegogo for the developmental costs of the project. These expenses include vehicles for transporting the trash, land for the dump / recycling center, permits, research, web development, copy and design plans for the project, travel, video production, etc. </p>
<p>Although centered on the trash wheel, this is a multi-faceted project with a business infrastructure that includes  an online store, boutique advertisement spaces, music and art festivals, and a repurposed plastics center, all supporting the costs of purchasing and maintaining the wheel.  </p>
<p>The wheel itself is projected to cost us $750,000 on it's own, we have secured initial investors and continue to field great interest in this endeavor. Up until this point, we have funded all of the work and all of the business overhead for development on our own - we need your help to see this through.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES:</span></h3>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></div>
<p>The risks we run in this project are minimized, because we are modeling our Ampenan River Project around Baltimore's proven success. The hydro solar powered trash wheel has already proven it's effectiveness in cleaning waterways. </p>
<p>We have already met with the necessary contingents to make sure we can install a trash wheel in the Jangkuk River and cleared it with the government - we are ready to go!</p>
<p>We know that there will be all kinds of challenges to this project, the installation, transport, and creation of our own waterwheel is sure to have a curveball or two, but we are dedicated to seeing this project through. </p>

<div><b>LATAR BELAKANG
Kami adalah tim yang terdiri dari : seniman, pembuat film, guru, pengusaha yang menginisiasi sebuah pergerakan untuk mencegah dan berupaya membersihkan samudera kita yang sangat berharga dari polusi plastik.
Kami akan menempatkan satu unit alat bertenaga air dan cahaya matahari yang akan menghadang dan mengangkut plastik dan sampah dari salah satu sungai yang paling tercemar di daerah timur NTB – Indonesia.
Indonesia, china dan India disebut bertanggung jawab atas 30% dari total produksi keseluruhan sampah secara global.
SUPPORTED BY: BALTIMORE HARBOUR INITIATIVE, BLUEWATERCRUISES, GILIECO TRUST, SEABINS PROJECT
TAMAN SUNGAI AMPENAN
Di Indonesia, sebuah tim yang diketuai warga lokal akan mendatangkan sebuah mesin (trash wheel) bertenaga air dan surya ke sungai terbesar di pulau Lombok bernama sungai Jangkuk, mesin tersebut akan ditempatkan pada 200 meter dari muara sungai yang bersinggungan langsung dengan Samudera Hindia. Mesin trash wheel tersebut diproduksi oleh perusahaan Amerika bernama Clearwater Mills yang telah membuktikan keberhasilannya di Baltimore, Maryland. Dilokasi itu mesin ini telah menghadang dan mengangkut lebih dari 354 ton sampah yang hanyut terbawa oleh aliran sungai Jones Falls dan mencegah sampah tersebut terbuang ke Samudera Atlantik.
Tujuan kami adalah merevitalisasi daerah aliran sungai Jangkuk di Ampenan-Lombok, menjadi taman sungai alami, yaitu membuatnya menjadi pusat area rekreasi dan usaha, diantaranya adalah dengan menggunakan teknologi yang bekerja tanpa henti menghalau dan mengangkut sampah bernama waterwheel. Alat inilah yang akan membersihkan sungai dan mencegah sampah mengalir ke samudera. Apa yang akan kami laksanakan ini mengacu pada kesuksesan yang telah terbukti terjadi di Baltimore, dimana sebuah pelabuhan yang ada di lokasi tersebut telah berhasil direvitalisasi menjadi lokasi pusat kegiatan masyarakat dan menjadi destinasi pariwisata, sekaligus memberikan edukasi, menumbuhkan kesadaran, dan menjaga tata kelola aliran air mereka.
Sebagai bagian dari program ini, kami juga akan berupaya mengedukasi warga lokal di Pulau Lombok tentang kondisi kerusakan samudera kita saat ini, setelahnya kami akan mengajak untuk bekerjasama mengenalkan pola penanganan sampah yang baik. 
Mesin tersebut akan mengumpulkan sampah yang jumlahnya akan sangat banyak pada musim penghujan, dan sampah itu akan diangkut ke suatu lokasi pembuangan yang sangat luas. Di area lokasi akan ditempatkannya Waterwhells untuk Sungai Jangkuk ini, telah tersedia ruas jalan yang akan sangat memudahkan akses transportasi untuk pengangkutan sampah tersebut. Setiap kontainer yang telah terisi sampah akan dibawa ke lokasi pembuangan, dimana dilokasi itu sampah akan disortir sembari dilakukan penelitian seperti yang dilaksanakan di Baltimore.
Salah satu langkah maju yang telah kami programkan dalam project ini adalah menjalin kerjasama dengan beberapa perusahaan dan para pengrajin yang memang telah fokus pada daur ulang sampah. Mereka mampu merubah sampah menjadi bahan mentah untuk pembuatan barang yang berguna seperti kantong, lampu, keranjang dan sebaginya. Meskipun project ini akan dilaksanakan di sungai dalam Kota di sebuah Pulau tertentu. Kami sangat yakin ini akan bisa menjadi percontohan yang akan menginspirasi seluruh Asia Tanggara bahkan seluruh Dunia, tentang cara menggabungkan edukasi dan sistem teknologi untuk memulai pembersihan saluran air kita secara menyeluruh. Mencegah kebiasaan membuang sampah sembarangan sekaligus menghalau sampah sebelum mengalir sampai ke Samudera.<br/></b></div>

HERE'S THE FINE PRINT:



In Indonesia, Oceans Care and Bluewater Cruises are bringing a hydro-solar powered trash wheel to the Jangkuk River in Lombok- the island's largest river located 200 meters from the Indian Ocean. The trash wheel was created by U.S. company Clearwater Mills and has proven to be a resounding success in Baltimore, Maryland - where it has intercepted over 354 tons of trash flowing in Jones Falls River from emptying into the Atlantic Ocean. 
Our aim is to revitalize the riverbed in Ampenan, Lombok, into a natural river park - creating a community hub of recreation and business, using the sustainable technology of the waterwheel trash interceptor to clean the river and keep the trash from flowing into the ocean. We are modeling our vision off of the proven success in Baltimore, where their Inner Harbor has been revitalized as a place of community and tourism, while providing education, awareness, and stewardship of their waterways. 
In addition to the implementation of a trash wheel, we will also be working to educate the local community in Lombok about the devastation of our oceans and working together to promote a working system of waste management. 

The wheel will collect the trash, in the most volume during storm surges, emptying it into a large dumpster. There is already a road at the projected site of Jangkuk River's future trash wheel, which will allow for easy access of transporting the trash. Each container will be brought to a dump in Lombok, where it will be sorted and studied, just like in Baltimore. 
We hope to take this project  one step further by partnering with companies and artisans, who are focused on re-purposing this waste into raw materials for production of goods - fabrics, baskets, bags, lamps, etc. 

Although this project in based in a solitary river and town on a single island, we believe that this model can inspire the rest of Southeast Asia and the world to incorporate this system of technology and education to begin cleaning our collective waterways - deterring littering and catching the waste before it goes into the ocean. 

WHAT'S THE $100,000 FOR EXACTLY?

We are using the money raised on Indiegogo for the developmental costs of the project. These expenses include vehicles for transporting the trash, land for the dump / recycling center, permits, research, web development, copy and design plans for the project, travel, video production, etc. 
Although centered on the trash wheel, this is a multi-faceted project with a business infrastructure that includes  an online store, boutique advertisement spaces, music and art festivals, and a repurposed plastics center, all supporting the costs of purchasing and maintaining the wheel.  
The wheel itself is projected to cost us $750,000 on it's own, we have secured initial investors and continue to field great interest in this endeavor. Up until this point, we have funded all of the work and all of the business overhead for development on our own - we need your help to see this through.

RISKS & CHALLENGES:

The risks we run in this project are minimized, because we are modeling our Ampenan River Project around Baltimore's proven success. The hydro solar powered trash wheel has already proven it's effectiveness in cleaning waterways. 
We have already met with the necessary contingents to make sure we can install a trash wheel in the Jangkuk River and cleared it with the government - we are ready to go!
We know that there will be all kinds of challenges to this project, the installation, transport, and creation of our own waterwheel is sure to have a curveball or two, but we are dedicated to seeing this project through.

LATAR BELAKANG
Kami adalah tim yang terdiri dari : seniman, pembuat film, guru, pengusaha yang menginisiasi sebuah pergerakan untuk mencegah dan berupaya membersihkan samudera kita yang sangat berharga dari polusi plastik.
Kami akan menempatkan satu unit alat bertenaga air dan cahaya matahari yang akan menghadang dan mengangkut plastik dan sampah dari salah satu sungai yang paling tercemar di daerah timur NTB – Indonesia.
Indonesia, china dan India disebut bertanggung jawab atas 30% dari total produksi keseluruhan sampah secara global.
SUPPORTED BY: BALTIMORE HARBOUR INITIATIVE, BLUEWATERCRUISES, GILIECO TRUST, SEABINS PROJECT
TAMAN SUNGAI AMPENAN
Di Indonesia, sebuah tim yang diketuai warga lokal akan mendatangkan sebuah mesin (trash wheel) bertenaga air dan surya ke sungai terbesar di pulau Lombok bernama sungai Jangkuk, mesin tersebut akan ditempatkan pada 200 meter dari muara sungai yang bersinggungan langsung dengan Samudera Hindia. Mesin trash wheel tersebut diproduksi oleh perusahaan Amerika bernama Clearwater Mills yang telah membuktikan keberhasilannya di Baltimore, Maryland. Dilokasi itu mesin ini telah menghadang dan mengangkut lebih dari 354 ton sampah yang hanyut terbawa oleh aliran sungai Jones Falls dan mencegah sampah tersebut terbuang ke Samudera Atlantik.
Tujuan kami adalah merevitalisasi daerah aliran sungai Jangkuk di Ampenan-Lombok, menjadi taman sungai alami, yaitu membuatnya menjadi pusat area rekreasi dan usaha, diantaranya adalah dengan menggunakan teknologi yang bekerja tanpa henti menghalau dan mengangkut sampah bernama waterwheel. Alat inilah yang akan membersihkan sungai dan mencegah sampah mengalir ke samudera. Apa yang akan kami laksanakan ini mengacu pada kesuksesan yang telah terbukti terjadi di Baltimore, dimana sebuah pelabuhan yang ada di lokasi tersebut telah berhasil direvitalisasi menjadi lokasi pusat kegiatan masyarakat dan menjadi destinasi pariwisata, sekaligus memberikan edukasi, menumbuhkan kesadaran, dan menjaga tata kelola aliran air mereka.
Sebagai bagian dari program ini, kami juga akan berupaya mengedukasi warga lokal di Pulau Lombok tentang kondisi kerusakan samudera kita saat ini, setelahnya kami akan mengajak untuk bekerjasama mengenalkan pola penanganan sampah yang baik. 
Mesin tersebut akan mengumpulkan sampah yang jumlahnya akan sangat banyak pada musim penghujan, dan sampah itu akan diangkut ke suatu lokasi pembuangan yang sangat luas. Di area lokasi akan ditempatkannya Waterwhells untuk Sungai Jangkuk ini, telah tersedia ruas jalan yang akan sangat memudahkan akses transportasi untuk pengangkutan sampah tersebut. Setiap kontainer yang telah terisi sampah akan dibawa ke lokasi pembuangan, dimana dilokasi itu sampah akan disortir sembari dilakukan penelitian seperti yang dilaksanakan di Baltimore.
Salah satu langkah maju yang telah kami programkan dalam project ini adalah menjalin kerjasama dengan beberapa perusahaan dan para pengrajin yang memang telah fokus pada daur ulang sampah. Mereka mampu merubah sampah menjadi bahan mentah untuk pembuatan barang yang berguna seperti kantong, lampu, keranjang dan sebaginya. Meskipun project ini akan dilaksanakan di sungai dalam Kota di sebuah Pulau tertentu. Kami sangat yakin ini akan bisa menjadi percontohan yang akan menginspirasi seluruh Asia Tanggara bahkan seluruh Dunia, tentang cara menggabungkan edukasi dan sistem teknologi untuk memulai pembersihan saluran air kita secara menyeluruh. Mencegah kebiasaan membuang sampah sembarangan sekaligus menghalau sampah sebelum mengalir sampai ke Samudera.",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

In just a minute, about 18,000 trees are cut, which is the equivalent area of 36 football fields. So every day, when you wake up, there are 27,000,000 trees less on the planet than the day before. Deforestation obviously happens far away from our cities yet it has a direct impact on our lives. Deforestation is one of the main causes of Climate Change, and because Climate Change is the worst problem of our time, we need to take action as soon as possible.Let’s have a look at how big this issue is:
Source www3.epa.govDeforestation is causing Climate Change. Wait... but how? It’s very simple. Climate Change is caused by greenhouse gas emissions, of which CO2 is by far the most important one. And we all know that trees absorb CO2, this is good! But when we cut trees, the opposite happens: all the CO2 the trees had absorbed is released into the atmosphere. When a tree dies, some CO2 is released into the air but this is compensated by new baby trees that start growing soon after. In fact most forest (and especially tropical forests) keep expanding naturally so more CO2 is stored over time. However when it’s a whole forest which disappears, a massive amount of CO2 is released. CO2 that was stored for centuries. And this represents 17% of Climate Change.A citizen solution to climate change and deforestationWe are using technology to create a platform that enables everyone to join our efforts to stop deforestation and start reforesting the world. Because no company, NGO or government can solve this problem by itself, we believe the solution must come from collaboration at a massive scale, and for that, we need the right tool.Tree-Nation helps planting projects to get the funds needed to start reforesting the world.Tree-Nation makes it easy for any planting project in the world to get the funds it needs to start planting trees. What is special and at the same time revolutionary in Tree-Nation is how we cut the middle-men and allow you the most direct contact with the planters in the field. We give you the tools to help those planters achieve their goals.This is what we are building!Any planting project in the world can join Tree-Nation freely. We provide them a very easy, step-by-step tool to digitalize their project. Each planter has a personalized section to record all the important information about their project. That includes it’s exact location, the species planted, the planting team, partners and much more... And most importantly, they get a chance to tell their stories through an updates page where they can post pictures, videos and articles. Tree planting is never dull and rosy... it's a tough job that requires sweat and dedication, but it’s incredibly gratifying to see a devastated land turn into a green forest. This is one of our plating projects in Costa RicaGet to know the planting teams behind the projects, follow their stories and help them achieve their goals.You will be able to discover these projects, follow their stories and talk with the planters as simply as you would do it with your friends on Facebook. This direct connection between you and the planters will enable a flow of feedback that will allow projects to improve and qualify their work. And once you've found a nice project, you then select the species you like and with just a few clicks you'll be able to plant real trees and start reforesting the world.Select a species and just plant it!Where are we now? Tree-Nation was founded in 2006. Along these years we've learned a lot and achieved milestones that some believed were impossible. We planted more than 800.000 trees, compensating more than 200 million Kilos of CO2.  And we are already working with 11 planting projects around the world. Our planting project in MadagascarThis first phase was our real-life pilot to proof and fine-tune our concept. Strong of this success we are now ready to switch gears, go full scale and provide a tool for all planting projects in the world. That’s why we have been redesigning our platform from scratch and refining it with all the knowledge we got from these past years working side by side with planters. We have already completed all the designs and we firmly believe this has all the needed potential to become what we dreamed of, but for that to happen... we need you!How will the money be used? If we reach our fundraising goal, we are going to spend 100% of the money on the development of the new Tree-Nation website. We already have the designs but the programming of a site as big and complex as Tree-Nation is very expensive. The first 25.000 € raised will allow us to create the projects section, as described above and in the video. This is the backbone of our platform. This means we’ll be able to welcome thousands of planting projects!
With the next 15.000 €, we’ll be able to integrate the virtual trees in our new format. A virtual tree is the virtual companion of a real tree, so that you can add content to it and even offer it as a gift; much better than giving flowers! You will also be able to create virtual forests and join other users forests, kind of a meeting point where users can share their passions and ideas. And all this will obviously require you to have your own profile, where you’ll find all your trees, forests and personalized counters so that you can keep track of the impact of your tree planting experience at Tree-Nation, and also check your CO2 balance. The virtual trees plus the virtual forests plus the personal profiles are the foundations of a uber friendly user community! Today in Tree-Nation we have a prehistoric version of all this and it has been enough for us to proof the concept, but not enough to make it fun and enjoyable to use.
Keep track of your impact
With the next 10.000 €, we will introduce gamification mechanics that will allow you to plant trees at no cost! Yes. We call it the seed system. It’s simple. Plant a seed and add to it some nice content, other users will start to water it and if the seed reaches 100 water drops in less than 5 days, a tree will be planted and you'll get a new seed!

After I finished primary school I went to a secondary mechanical school. It turned out this didn’t fit me, but I finished it nevertheless. Afterwards I went to a college of environmental protection, which was perfect for me, but the sun outside was too strong to keep me inside. One day I will finish it. Ever since I was a child my love for nature was very strong. I owe this to my grandmothers, grandfathers, mom and dad. I remember how special the moments fishing with grandfather were and how I enjoyed hiking with dad. I felt peace and patience, enjoyed the beauty, and had fun. Some of the really special memories I have are how we walked with my grandfather through the city where we lived – Velenje. Every time we crossed the bridge over Paka river we stopped in the middle and played a game of who would be the first to spot a fish. For me, just a little kid, this was amazing, and it still is. After a while when this little Žiga grew up, I was walking with my friends across one of this bridges in Velenje. Of course, I stopped to play the game, and what I saw was waste and no fish. “Oh boy”, I thought, took my shoes off and went to pick the waste. My friends went too. Since that day it is hard for me to see waste in the Water, so I clean them. I always have a range of feelings about this – I feel a lot of sadness and anger, but in the end, I am always happy and joyful to see the Water clean.</p><p>The question, why it is like that, is strong, and after a while I realized that, only through action I can achieve what I wish for. And this is what most of us want. To take care for each other, ourselves and also for this magical planet Mother Earth. To see the beauties in ourselves and in everything around us. To live this journey called Life in harmony, peace, love, respect and unity. But as we all know beautiful things wouldn't be as beautiful without the ugly ones beside them. With this project and your help we will get a little bit closer to our Dreams.</p><p>The goal I imagined is $2222. This means 222,2 hours of cleaning waters around the world, including food and drink for everyone who will help. </p><p>In 1 hour I usually fill a 100 litre garbage bag, depending on how dirty the Water or beach is.</p><p>If we don’t reach the goal, your donations will be spent for cleaning the Water nevertheless. But the more resources we have, the more we can clean.</p><p>The idea for this campaign was born four years ago in Sri Lanka, while I was walking on the beach of Hikkaduwa and picking waste. I wanted to travel the world, see its beauties, play the music, connect with family, get challenged by life, put the pieces of my soul back together, heal the wounds, become a man, and just enjoy life. It takes so much courage for me to write these words and make the first step. This campaign is a part of the journey and also the first step. I would like to share this journey with you, and at the same time do something nice for everything and everyone of us…</p><p><strong>project Clean Spirit of Silent Water will contribute on many levels to all of us:</strong></p><p>- giving and receiving unconditional Love we all deserve</p><p>- encouraging us to follow our hearts</p><p>- raising awareness about taking care for our Home and at the same time our inner Water</p><p>- reminding us of our ancestors who lived here before and sharing their knowledge how to treat ourselves and the Planet Earth</p><p>- sharing the gifts that we all carry within our souls</p><p>- building the ""bridges"" and balance between modern and ancient world</p><p>- showing respect and gratitude to the Water, Air, Fire, Earth, People, Ancestors, Animals, Plants, Spirits, Gods, Angels, Guides, all four direction ( east, south, west and north), elfs, mermaids and everything that exists.</p><p>The Earth is providing us everything we need so we can survive, live happily on our visit here. In exchange she just needs from us, our care,gratitude and respect. It is our responsibility to treat her well during this visit. The way we treat the nature is a reflection of how we treat ourselves. I am a great believer, I believe that everything is made precisely by the magnificent force which created us, our entire Universe is in a perfect divine order. So all the worries are therefore needless, when we surrender in trust to divinity in belief.</p><p>But I also believe that if we will not change our attitude, sooner or later we’ll have to. It is so  simple and clear for me to feel this. Perhaps this is just my view of life, but I am sure that you can feel it too, this is a collective call and it does concern us all. So with this campaign I would like to contribute and call you, to be a part of it, too. We can all make a change in a sense, that each and everyone of us puts a little piece of him - herself to it, just by following the heart and the call from it. This is an invitation for you, to be a part of something beautiful and educational. To start a journey into a New Paradigm of coexistence. It is important to make risks in except challenges of our heart, soul calls. If we don't risk, we'll probably never know how is on the other side, out of our comfort zone.</p><p>The only problem I see in advance is that I will often not have internet connection on the road. Therefore you will probably see videos, photos and a journal about what is going on, with a little delay. We are already working, taking pics and videos, writing down working hours and weight of saved trashes. Challenges and risks we will hug and accept, and as well I will let you know, how it will all go, as soon as possible.</p><p>In Decembrer 2017, we cleaned Italian Water, next destination is Bosnia and Herzegovina in April.</p><p>As I mentioned in the video, if this made you smile just a little bit, or if it moved you in any way, made you feel good, it is a lot already enough. If you will do something for the Nature, you'll soon see the magic of the loving exchange. Nature is so generous in showing and giving us her Love and Care back.</p><p><strong>If you have a spare minute, please share this campaign.

It takes so much courage for me to write these words and make the first step. This campaign is a part of the journey and also the first step. I would like to share this journey with you, and at the same time do something nice for everything and everyone of us…project Clean Spirit of Silent Water will contribute on many levels to all of us:- giving and receiving unconditional Love we all deserve- encouraging us to follow our hearts- raising awareness about taking care for our Home and at the same time our inner Water- reminding us of our ancestors who lived here before and sharing their knowledge how to treat ourselves and the Planet Earth- sharing the gifts that we all carry within our souls- building the ""bridges"" and balance between modern and ancient world- showing respect and gratitude to the Water, Air, Fire, Earth, People, Ancestors, Animals, Plants, Spirits, Gods, Angels, Guides, all four direction ( east, south, west and north), elfs, mermaids and everything that exists.The Earth is providing us everything we need so we can survive, live happily on our visit here. In exchange she just needs from us, our care,gratitude and respect. It is our responsibility to treat her well during this visit. The way we treat the nature is a reflection of how we treat ourselves. I am a great believer, I believe that everything is made precisely by the magnificent force which created us, our entire Universe is in a perfect divine order. So all the worries are therefore needless, when we surrender in trust to divinity in belief.But I also believe that if we will not change our attitude, sooner or later we’ll have to. It is so  simple and clear for me to feel this. Perhaps this is just my view of life, but I am sure that you can feel it too, this is a collective call and it does concern us all. So with this campaign I would like to contribute and call you, to be a part of it, too. We can all make a change in a sense, that each and everyone of us puts a little piece of him - herself to it, just by following the heart and the call from it. This is an invitation for you, to be a part of something beautiful and educational. To start a journey into a New Paradigm of coexistence. It is important to make risks in except challenges of our heart, soul calls. If we don't risk, we'll probably never know how is on the other side, out of our comfort zone.The only problem I see in advance is that I will often not have internet connection on the road. Therefore you will probably see videos, photos and a journal about what is going on, with a little delay. We are already working, taking pics and videos, writing down working hours and weight of saved trashes. Challenges and risks we will hug and accept, and as well I will let you know, how it will all go, as soon as possible.In Decembrer 2017, we cleaned Italian Water, next destination is Bosnia and Herzegovina in April.As I mentioned in the video, if this made you smile just a little bit, or if it moved you in any way, made you feel good, it is a lot already enough. If you will do something for the Nature, you'll soon see the magic of the loving exchange. Nature is so generous in showing and giving us her Love and Care back.If you have a spare minute, please share this campaign. Also fell free to share your actions and reflections on a Facebook and Instagram page Clean Spirit Of Silent Water.  Thank YouWith Love & JoyŽiga",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our first earthbag house.</p>
In our 7 years of living off-grid, we've learned a lot and we will put all of this knowledge and more into our most ambitious project yet - a fossil fuel-free house that uses passive solar design, thermal mass and hydronics (heated floors) to stay comfortable year-round without burning ANY fossil-fuels. We will also use biogas for cooking, solar electricity and solar water heating. We'll collect rainwater for utility use and have a spring for drinking water. We also use the <a href=""http://humanurehandbook.com/manual.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://humanurehandbook.com/manual.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">humanure composting system</a>. This house will be extremely affordable, incredibly strong, safe and comfortable, with many modern luxuries, even a hot tub! It may end up looking different than our drawing but, regardless, it will have the same systems and basic features. <h3><br/></h3>

<p>Over a lifetime, conventionally built modern houses use an extreme amount of energy to heat and cool them. If you're on grid, most of this energy is likely supplied by coal or nuclear. Both of these are devastating and dangerous to the environment and living things. This Winter (Dec 2015), those of us living on the East coast and folks in the Midwest have been experiencing climate chaos directly, with Summer-like temperatures and massive flooding. By building intelligently and thoughtfully and keeping natural cycles in mind, we can build a house that doesn't hemorrhage energy and money just to be livable, nor do we fight nature and pollute the atmosphere. We want to prove to the world that this can be done and show how. </p>
<p>This will be a do-it-yourself, owner-built home and we plan to share what we've learned with other builders and permaculture enthusiasts. By funding this project, you will help it become a reality and also help to share these ideas and techniques with the rest of the world. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Some of the techniques we'll use:</h3>

</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Earthbags</b> - earthbag building is one of the lesser known natural building methods and one of the most </span>versatile. A typical bag is clay and sand in a sandbag. The clay acts as a binder and the sand stabilizes the bags so the mix won't shrink too much as they dry. Earthbag walls are bullet-proof, fire-proof, bug-proof, flood-proof, impact-proof - you get the point, they're very strong! <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Solar electric</b> - we already have 1 kW of panels and 8 Trojan L-16 deep cycle batteries. Our electrical needs are pretty minimal, our biggest draw is a DC fridge. We use LED lights (which are extremely efficient and long lasting) and modern tablets and laptops use very little energy.</li>
<li>
<b>Solar hot water</b> - to free ourselves of having to use propane, we'll install a solar hot water system. This will include a well-insulated holding tank to keep the water warm for prolonged periods. We may also wrap a coil around our wood stove for hot water during long, cloudy periods.</li>
<li>
<b>Biogas</b> - biogas is mostly methane and is produced when organic matter decays. This can be collected and used to power stoves or other gas appliances. This will be used mostly for cooking and will help us become totally propane free.</li>
<li>
<b>Hydronics</b> - by piping hot water through pex in our floor, we will heat our house from the ground up.</li>
<li>
<b>Rainwater harvesting</b> - we have used rainwater for almost 7 years. We will also collect rain at this house.</li>
<li>
<b>Passive solar and thermal mass </b>- by having lots of South-facing windows we will maximize Winter solar gain. All of those windows you see at the bottom of the house are actually super-insulated freezer doors. By having the back of the house bermed (back-filled) we help regulate the inside temperature. These are the same principles that earthships use to stay comfortable. By using earthbags instead of rammed-earth tires, we save an extreme amount of labor.</li>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">The humanure system </b>- an easy, effective and inexpensive composting method.</li>
<li>
<b>Bottle wall</b> - a beautiful natural building method where bottles are placed in an earthen wall. The tree design you see on the front of the fossil fuel-free house will be bottle wall. From the inside it has an effect like stained glass.</li>
</ul>

<div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A picture of the bottle wall before the sun room was added.</span></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>We will have a wood stove but I think it will mostly be for those times when we want to sit by the fire. We may later build a rocket or a masonry stove - we haven't decided which yet. There will likely be a fairly short transitional phase where we are still using some amount of propane for cooking and water heating. We may be able to reduce or avoid this entirely by cooking and heating water with a diversion load. </span><br/>

</div></div>","Hello friends! My name is Morgan Caraway and I am a natural builder, homesteader, intentional community co-founder and author. In 2009 my wife, Mary Jane, and I moved on to a piece of undeveloped land in the Blue Ridge Mountains and began a homesteading adventure. We built a yurt, earthbag house and a cordwood bath house. Since then we joined a small, private intentional community and have helped build a pole barn and an earthbag house using earthship principles. My first exposure to natural building was through the original earthship book by Mike Reynolds. He's still a hero of mine to this day.





Our first earthbag house.
In our 7 years of living off-grid, we've learned a lot and we will put all of this knowledge and more into our most ambitious project yet - a fossil fuel-free house that uses passive solar design, thermal mass and hydronics (heated floors) to stay comfortable year-round without burning ANY fossil-fuels. We will also use biogas for cooking, solar electricity and solar water heating. We'll collect rainwater for utility use and have a spring for drinking water. We also use the humanure composting system. This house will be extremely affordable, incredibly strong, safe and comfortable, with many modern luxuries, even a hot tub! It may end up looking different than our drawing but, regardless, it will have the same systems and basic features. 




Over a lifetime, conventionally built modern houses use an extreme amount of energy to heat and cool them. If you're on grid, most of this energy is likely supplied by coal or nuclear. Both of these are devastating and dangerous to the environment and living things. This Winter (Dec 2015), those of us living on the East coast and folks in the Midwest have been experiencing climate chaos directly, with Summer-like temperatures and massive flooding. By building intelligently and thoughtfully and keeping natural cycles in mind, we can build a house that doesn't hemorrhage energy and money just to be livable, nor do we fight nature and pollute the atmosphere. We want to prove to the world that this can be done and show how. 
This will be a do-it-yourself, owner-built home and we plan to share what we've learned with other builders and permaculture enthusiasts. By funding this project, you will help it become a reality and also help to share these ideas and techniques with the rest of the world. 

Some of the techniques we'll use:







Earthbags - earthbag building is one of the lesser known natural building methods and one of the most versatile. A typical bag is clay and sand in a sandbag. The clay acts as a binder and the sand stabilizes the bags so the mix won't shrink too much as they dry. Earthbag walls are bullet-proof, fire-proof, bug-proof, flood-proof, impact-proof - you get the point, they're very strong! 


Solar electric - we already have 1 kW of panels and 8 Trojan L-16 deep cycle batteries. Our electrical needs are pretty minimal, our biggest draw is a DC fridge. We use LED lights (which are extremely efficient and long lasting) and modern tablets and laptops use very little energy.

Solar hot water - to free ourselves of having to use propane, we'll install a solar hot water system. This will include a well-insulated holding tank to keep the water warm for prolonged periods. We may also wrap a coil around our wood stove for hot water during long, cloudy periods.

Biogas - biogas is mostly methane and is produced when organic matter decays. This can be collected and used to power stoves or other gas appliances. This will be used mostly for cooking and will help us become totally propane free.

Hydronics - by piping hot water through pex in our floor, we will heat our house from the ground up.

Rainwater harvesting - we have used rainwater for almost 7 years. We will also collect rain at this house.

Passive solar and thermal mass - by having lots of South-facing windows we will maximize Winter solar gain. All of those windows you see at the bottom of the house are actually super-insulated freezer doors. By having the back of the house bermed (back-filled) we help regulate the inside temperature. These are the same principles that earthships use to stay comfortable. By using earthbags instead of rammed-earth tires, we save an extreme amount of labor.

The humanure system - an easy, effective and inexpensive composting method.

Bottle wall - a beautiful natural building method where bottles are placed in an earthen wall. The tree design you see on the front of the fossil fuel-free house will be bottle wall. From the inside it has an effect like stained glass.


A picture of the bottle wall before the sun room was added.
We will have a wood stove but I think it will mostly be for those times when we want to sit by the fire. We may later build a rocket or a masonry stove - we haven't decided which yet. There will likely be a fairly short transitional phase where we are still using some amount of propane for cooking and water heating. We may be able to reduce or avoid this entirely by cooking and heating water with a diversion load. 

Needs and Perks


 Our campaign has a goal of $5,000. This money will cover part of the cost of the materials for the house. We will attempt to scrounge the rest of what we need together as we go unless the campaign gets overfunded, in which case it will all go towards building materials.

$1500 land clearing and leveling.
$500 for 2000 sandbags
$6000 lumber/flooring/hardware
$2000 windows and doors
$1600 fixtures/electrical/plumbing
$500 loads of dirt for plaster, bag fill and backfilling
$1800 insulation 
$2000 solar hot water system
$800 gravel
---------------------------------------
Total - $16,700

Everyone who donates at the level of $10 or above will get a first-release download link to the professionally produced, exclusive documentary about the building of this house (upon completion of the house and documentary, of course!) and all tiers above that will get a physical copy (DVD or USB flash memory) and our deep gratitude. All donors will be thanked in the credits of our documentary. 

Higher tiers will include the book ""A Sustainable Life"" (projected release date - late 2017) a how-to book that details in step-by-step instructions our building projects, including this new house and/or ""Ecological Awakening"" - an educational book that points out our inseparable connection to the environment in an attempt to wake humanity up (it should be done by late 2016). The highest levels will get skype consultations with me (Morgan) or even direct physical help for someone who lives close enough. 
For some examples of my writing. you can look at another project of mine: The Church of Nature.

<p><b>If we can just get this land properly irrigated it will be a thriving habitat and organic farm dedicated to raising and rehabilitating HoneyBees.</b></p>
<p>The 20 acres has dozens of 100 year old pecan trees. Some 80-90 ft tall. This area East of Austin was some of the first area settled for farming when Austin formed.</p>
<p>If properly irrigated it would be a lush, multi-faceted space for not just animals but the public to enjoy. If funded we plan to grow thinner rows of wildflowers. Once the Bees and other pollinators use them we will allow the public to come out and easily pick fresh, beautiful Texas wildflowers and experience this beautiful farm. We plant Zinnias, Cosmos, Petunias, Blue Sage and many others.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create a haven to raise huge, healthy hives that don't need to forage far for food. We also plan on rearing Queen Bees to help combat the savage Bee problem in Texas. </p>
<p>We work closely with and have always been mentored by a member of the Texas Master Beekeeping Program and recently appointed Travis County “Bee Expert”, Mr. David Stalker. David has shown us and continues to teach us how to humanely raise Bees, humanely harvest honey and how to farm chemically free . The goal is and always will be about creating more healthy hives and building the endangered Bee population.</p>

hybridus was included in the list of 25 most endangered primate in the world 2014-2016 by (IUCN/SSC). This species of primate, distributed in Colombia and Venezuela is Critically Endangered according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2008), primarily due to habitat loss and hunting.  In Libro Rojo de la Fauna Venezolana, a book listing Venezuelan animals
and their conservation status, consideres A.
hybridus as endangered (Rodríguez and Rojas-Suarez. 1999). 
The Caparo Forest Reserve is located at 
the western plains of Venezuela. In this reserve there are remains 
of seasonal forests that occupied the plains of 
Venezuela and Colombia. This is one of the few locations on earth where this species of monkey
is distributed and it is located in the area that is considered the most
threatened for the species. It is important to note that in Venezuela, a
“forest reserve” is not a protected area as you might imagine, on the contrary
it is considered a place with precious wood that it is being saved for future extraction.The area we are trying to save is a
privately owned neighboring the reserve where the monkeys live.  The original area of the Caparo Forest Reserve was of over 184,000 ha of
continuous forest, which in the last 30 years have been reduced to mere 7,000
ha plus several small isolated forest fragments of up to 150 ha. So the area
where they live has been severely reduced, so you can imagine how alarming the
situation for the spider monkeys living there is. On top of that, those forest
fragments  are surrounded by 1,200
encroaching farms that use the land essentially for livestock.  Groups of spider monkeys have been found in
some of these forest fragments. In the maps below you’ll be able to see just
how much forest was and continues to be lost.
The encroachment threats, logging in natural
forests and plantations for illegal timber extraction and forest
firesare seriously affecting the survival of
the spider monkeys population inhabiting Caparo.In this satellite image below, Spot 2007, you can observed the forest fragments and the remaining 7000 hectares



Urgency:
There is a group of 20 spider monkeys living in one of these forest fragments,
they are in danger because every year, a portion of the forest disappears.  
This forest fragment has an area of 20 hectares within a plot of 30 hectares, in a locality known as ""Palma Pintada"", on edge of the forest largest, the owner plans to deforest this year, but also is open the option of selling the whole 30 hectares plot.

 Impact
How the money will be spent:
With your collaboration we want to buy 30 hectares of land that contains the forest fragment and to save a group of spider monkeys  of 20 individuals, establish the based for the Spider Monkey Project, where there can be students, volunteers and researchers for a future management
plan for this group.

<p>After many years of active participation in environmental
protection activities it was clear that those who live and know the area are
the best protectors and savors of the land. 
Therefore we chose native herders for this project.   </p>
<p>Upon research conducted on challenges these herders face we
found that majority of them identified “desire to have electricity, hot and
cold water like the big city and be able to use cellphones, computer,
television  and be in tune with the rest
of the world” as the primary need.</p>
<p>These herders send their children to the city for education
but once children get the taste of comfortable lifestyle in the city they have
no desire to return to the countryside and go through the hardships of nomadic
way of life.  This has affected the
decrease in number of young herders and today most of the herders are those who
are in their 40s, 50s and 60s. 
Even though, the purpose of our project is geared towards environmental
protection it also has a much broader spectrum of maintaining traditional
nomadic way of life from fading away and continuing our heritage to the next
generation.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>We have 10 years of experience in working in the area of environmental protection  in the country.  The wisdom of nomadic Mongols have always lied on effective consumerism on day to day life rather than over consumption which western developed countries are now striving to achieve. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Advancing the nomadic way of life, a lifestyle that has least negative impact on the environment, and inheriting it to the next generation is the goal of our many years of hard work and experience.  Environment protection does not fall on one particular individual but rather a way of living consciously on how we impact the environment through our everyday life and be a role mode to our young generation and teach them on how to reduce negative impact on the environment.</p>
<p>The most effective way to organize this project and to reach public and the higher leadership in the government is to establish a model soum and sub soums.  The important aspect of it is to make the government see and understand our goals and thus make them find alternate and better ways to develop our country without damaging the homeland and to hand it to our next generation in one piece.  We are the representatives of the new generation who are united in protecting our nature and homeland and we made it our mission to make the change happen through our dedication and hard work above everything else. </p>

<p>Mongolia has a tremendous amount of natural resources and
actively taking actions to put these resources into economic circulations.  This has resulted environmental degradation
in such fast pace that we’re facing the danger of extinction of pristine nature
in our country.  So it is of vital
importance to start the project in the nearest future. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>USE OF FUNDS</b></p>
<p>The unit cost of the equipment is 150,000USD and it is very expensive for
an average nomadic family to procure one. 
We propose to implement initial phase of our project as a grant,
supplying, installing and providing repair work free of charge to the families.  This ensures quick outreach to the public in
short period of time.   </p>
<p>The equipment is specifically designed for the conditions of Mongolia and
being made as a special order.  </p>

These herders send their children to the city for education
but once children get the taste of comfortable lifestyle in the city they have
no desire to return to the countryside and go through the hardships of nomadic
way of life.  This has affected the
decrease in number of young herders and today most of the herders are those who
are in their 40s, 50s and 60s. 
Even though, the purpose of our project is geared towards environmental
protection it also has a much broader spectrum of maintaining traditional
nomadic way of life from fading away and continuing our heritage to the next
generation.
IMPACT TO ENVIRONMENT·  Re-using animal dung and manure to produce energy would reduce greenhouse gas and dissemination of CH4 compounds in the atmosphere.  · 
The fertilizer produced from the machine can be used to
feed the livestock as Mongolia is facing shortage in pasture land.  This ensures to keep the environment pristine
as well as managing the traditional way of herding without damaging the
land. ·  Abandoned and neglected part of the country will have inhabitants who will look after the land and protect it. 
IMPACT TO WAY OF LIFE

· 
Each and every family will have
ability generate their own electricity and be self -sufficient.  

IMPACT TO SOCIAL AND ECONOMY
·  Continuing the traditional way of living and prepare the next generation to inherit the heritage. · 
Increasing the number of young
herders that are rapidly in decline.
· 
Reducing the unemployment level

WHY US?


We have 10 years of experience in working in the area of environmental protection  in the country.  The wisdom of nomadic Mongols have always lied on effective consumerism on day to day life rather than over consumption which western developed countries are now striving to achieve. 

Advancing the nomadic way of life, a lifestyle that has least negative impact on the environment, and inheriting it to the next generation is the goal of our many years of hard work and experience.  Environment protection does not fall on one particular individual but rather a way of living consciously on how we impact the environment through our everyday life and be a role mode to our young generation and teach them on how to reduce negative impact on the environment.
The most effective way to organize this project and to reach public and the higher leadership in the government is to establish a model soum and sub soums.  The important aspect of it is to make the government see and understand our goals and thus make them find alternate and better ways to develop our country without damaging the homeland and to hand it to our next generation in one piece.  We are the representatives of the new generation who are united in protecting our nature and homeland and we made it our mission to make the change happen through our dedication and hard work above everything else. 

WHY NOW?





Mongolia has a tremendous amount of natural resources and
actively taking actions to put these resources into economic circulations.  This has resulted environmental degradation
in such fast pace that we’re facing the danger of extinction of pristine nature
in our country.  So it is of vital
importance to start the project in the nearest future. 

USE OF FUNDS
The unit cost of the equipment is 150,000USD and it is very expensive for
an average nomadic family to procure one. 
We propose to implement initial phase of our project as a grant,
supplying, installing and providing repair work free of charge to the families.  This ensures quick outreach to the public in
short period of time.   
The equipment is specifically designed for the conditions of Mongolia and
being made as a special order.  
For more details of the equipment:

http://www.biolectric.be/We will be responsible for costs of installation, repair, transportation,
training and monitoring.

Visit the Urban Good shop. The London National Park City is well on its way to being established. We need to build tools to help everyone explore the London National Park City and get the most from it. Connecting children and adults to nature, experiencing the benefits of green and blue space, finding the play spaces, seeking out the trails and cycle paths, learning about biodiversity and where to look for all the above is why we are making this map. It will be a large-format, folded map – similar in shape and feel to the old, paper Ordnance Survey Explorer maps, but custom drawn to highlight places to explore.Plus ... We have space on the reverse of the map for a beautiful atlas: showing the geology, watercourses, densities, contours, transport networks and many other layers of information that make up London National Park City. An engaging way to learn more about the complex systems that structure the park.We want to know what everyone wants to see on the map: the cycle routes, the quiet spaces, the best vistas and so on. We will run a public campaign to reach out and ask Londoners what they want on their map.Then, once we have printed it, we want to be sure that everyone who needs one can get one. We are aiming to print 10,000 in the first run, but will gauge interest and demand in the run up. Our pitch is to use surplus funding to send free copies to groups who would usually not get one and to make sure they go far and wide.To achieve this, Charlie Peel from The New Civic has partnered with the London National Park City Initiative to make and sell some fine art prints as rewards to generate enough funding to commission, design and produce a master map of the park. We hope you like them and will want some. Thanks for taking the time to get this far. NOW... THE REWARDS! What will you get?
Every backer will be sent a copy of our final National Park City map.

It is attributed to bee diseases and insecticides among bee stresses as also converging lesser forage areas for bees.  But will the blame game do any good to save bees?</p><p>I find it is not at all helping and on the other hand it is getting from bad to worse. I strongly feel the need to act  and be responsible. If we don't take responsibility who else will?</p><p>Who am I?</p><p>I am VG, a farmer by birth and have great passion for bees and nature. My research on bees during the seventies and eighties gave me more insight into bee values. Ever since  I have acted on several occasions to spread bee values and have contributed a lot in creating awareness on bees and bee products. Today I feel the need to take up the bees decline as a global issue and feels it is time to act and show my responsibility to the world.   </p><ul>
<li>This is not the beginning of my social work nor is it aimed for any personal benefit. I have been involved in many  social responsibility  projects in and around my village, including propagating beekeeping and training the public and school children on bees and its importance in nature. It has been there for several years.</li>
<li>In my journey I have initiated honey processing center/bee breeding/beekeeping of added income/bees in agriculture etc in my village with dedication to educate people on bee values and bee products.</li>
<li>My findings that mining bee products like royal jelly, pollen, propolis, bee venom etc., all of which has high commercial value in wellness, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries should make beekeeping a sustainable entrepreneurial choice did find slow results. Again it is disheartening to find people drifting from agriculture.  </li>
<li>A time has now come that bees are declining to the extent of extinct and the global scenario is worse than ever.  Bees are needed not just by one country and bees fly beyond geographical boundaries defying political limits and frames. </li>
<li>As a first step of my global activity, I founded Global Bee Village, a platform for all the bee enthusiasts and bee experts to join and share their opinion.    </li>
</ul><p><a href=""https://globalbeevillage.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477213115/uoyqe37eypsmiczlo1fl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p>The global reach was made much more practical with the social platforms and with my interest in quest for knowledge on bees of the world. The support from the bee experts from all over the world was overwhelming and many serious discussions over a period made me to enter the 2nd stage of my global operation of breeding more bees to fight against bees decline.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Bees For Us Project </strong></h2><p>Bees for us project is born to simply breed more bees involving people and making a system to spontaneously work into and within the people. It is a self sustaining project that goes by its own, once initiated.  </p><p>Infographic on the project is here. <a href=""https://magic.piktochart.com/output/16315606-save-honey-bees-from-extinction"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click to see</a></p><ul>
<li>Bees for us project is an on the field practical deployment of bees reaching out the pupils, public and farmers .  It is a self-sustaining system. </li>
<li>Why should it be such an elaborate one with apiary, education, awareness and also deployment of bees in rural and urban areas?  </li>
</ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The simple reason is they are connected to each other. If all those aspects are not handled at a time, the project can fail or drag and there is less time with us. Bees are fast disappearing. </p><ul><li>What is my back ground?</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Looking  years back, I have successfully implemented  several co-operative level agricultural operations like forming milk society, agricultural society, educational libraries, and schools . That gives me a pragmatic approach to evolve a system that works continuously and on sustainable basis. It is several years experience and exposure that is its backbone.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The base and core strength of the system is forming an Apiculture Incubation Farm that will have :      </p><ol>
<li> Apiary for show casing,research and sustainability.</li>
<li> Breeding center for producing more 'resistant' bees. </li>
<li> Education facility for imparting knowledge in young generation on bee values.</li>
<li> Propagation and bee awareness creation in public.</li>
<li> Support farmers for bee keeping by total bee keeping solution.</li>
<li> Servicing the urban bee enthusiasts, encouraging and supporting their needs.</li>
</ol><p>An apiary shall give a strong back up in educating, creating awareness, and sustainability and in providing total solution for bee keeping to one and all. There is very few or less professional set up at present in most of the countries that gives a 'total bee keeping solution' under one umbrella. The apiculture incubation farm takes such an initiative.</p><p>The above said six programs of the incubation farm are most essential to make it work fool proof. In other words, an apiary alone will not make it work; an education system alone cannot break the ice, a farmer approach alone shall not meet the need, a simple urban approach alone cannot solve the issues of bee decline and the strong need to breed more bees.</p><p><strong><u>Location:</u></strong></p><p>I know that location makes a lot of difference when handling a global issue like that of bees.  It is after days and months of thought that we finally decided to start the incubation farm in Dubai.</p><p>It is a location to make the message reach the maximum people at minimum time,  Dubai is a country of possibilities and has many firsts in its crown. Dubai has more than 200 nationalities living and working and is a commercial hub to Asian and European markets. Any system can easily percolate down the world from Dubai at ease.</p><p>It is also important to have the Apiculture Incubation Farm for sustainability and income generation as it involves the need for  cash for practical implementation of breeding more bees and deploying them in the field while mitigating bee decline paving way for unlimited job opportunities  and also showing direction to entrepreneurs connected with bees and agriculture.</p><p>With my back ground as a chemical engineer, as certified NLP coach and having trained more than 30000 entrepreneurs on different fields with the exceptional motivational skill and drive, the support of people around me gives me great strength to move and work towards this goal and of making it possible to have one bee colony for every 10 person on earth by 2030. Project 'Bees for us' of my concept and plan is one that will make far reaching positive results in  quality agricultural development in every nook and corner.</p><p>I am sure with people cooperation and drive, the project would take shape soon. Your cooperation and support is essential for that to happen as you are the people, you are my friend and you are my supporter.</p><p>Every contribution to this novel project, first of its kind, shall show the depth of love for sustaining bees on earth. It Is a need and necessity of every one of us as bee decline is indirectly making every person spend more than what he/she should have due to increase in cost of food, clothing and also in maintaining our vulnerable environment including air and water.</p><p>Your contribution may be sacrificing a tea, a movie, a gadget that you want to acquire; it may be just giving an unwanted thing off in your house, it may be a day’s earnings or a month’s salary.  It sure is an involvement that you make in keeping the world sustain with bees, for your own food and existence upon this earth. </p><p>Think of your children. Today, if what you make is for your children,  think of bees decline destroying their future!!  Bees help us to create abundance. They do it just by pollination and maintaining the ecosystem. </p><p>If it is not you who else will build it? It is not my project; it is our project and I just take the lead. </p><p>There are several perks and chances to win more than you contribute.  You can contribute even a small amount you decide with the inner feeling of a 'generous giving' for a great cause.</p><p>Remember, the project is for you; for each one of us. </p><p>All contributions shall be acknowledged promptly.</p><p><strong>The System that will continue to work.</strong></p><p>The Apiculture Incubation Farm is continuously supported by the bee experts from the world (Global Bee Village as the platform) with the bee technologies and best of the bee management practices shall be implemented.</p><p>Along with the incubation farm, local entrepreneurs are  encouraged to form independent entrepreneurial cells called 'Bee Cells' in hundreds and that further encourages ""BeeVs"".</p><p>The Apiculture Incubation Farm shall remain as the  mother of all Bee Cells and BeeVs.</p><p>Infographics for you.<a href=""https://magic.piktochart.com/output/16315606-save-honey-bees-from-extinction"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Click on.</a></p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>The public contributions are going to change the bees volume in this world. It will sure generate job opportunities and more of our food crop while promoting entrepreneurs. </p><p>This initiative is expected to make every country tell each farmer in the agricultural sector to have a minimum number of bee colonies for enjoying any government support and subsidies.</p><p>It will change the bee awareness of people around, as more and more people will start talking about it and know importance of bees.</p><p>The fundamental education about bees for children will make them learn about the bees as an institution that has many things of value to teach and learn. It will bring more discipline in children and cohesiveness in working together for any project they do. A better citizen with bees education is not far off.</p><p>Total bee keeping solution will make people own bees and learn more about bee products. It will change their life style and they shall be more healthy and free from sickness. </p><p>Bees will bring abundance everywhere. There will be more of water and food. Air will be cleaner. Atmosphere will be cooler.</p><p> With the increased bees, our food will become poison free, our water will get less contaminated.</p><p>Your contribution is going to make a long term impact in the ecosystem and it is vital.</p><p>Bringing more of nature in our daily life with bees supporting us all the way and we supporting them to survive, </p><p><strong>How much fund is required and why? </strong></p><p>To build an Apiculture Incubation Farm in Dubai,  it needs to have an appropriate agricultural land not far off from cities, hundreds of bee colonies, thousands of bee hives, bee handling tools, bee product processing machinery, bee breeding facilities, bee feeding for lean period, lots of bee keepers to have bee management, bee expertise for training and mining bee products, servicing facility, making a self-learning educational observational bee hive with servicing back up, awareness campaign arrangements with transport facility, on field training and so on.  It all really needs a huge amount.</p><p>Within the best limitations and for all the things to bring into operation and as per my worked out business plan it shall need  at best  $ 600,000 ; less expenses for this campaign.   </p><ul>
<li>Educational models of self-imparting and 'any time learning' system development is expected to take time and effort as also financial commitment while taking a great responsibility.   </li>
<li>Setting up of an awareness training center and farmers involvement needs a lot of local  interactions and effort.</li>
<li>Urban bee keeping might involve a  collaborative arrangement and ready service facility that needs dealing with emergency situations and risk.</li>
</ul><p><u><strong>The joy of contribution:</strong></u></p><p>The joy of contribution is that cannot be explained in words. You love the bees and  it is a love that you share for the well being of your own children.</p><p>Each contribution comes with a wonderful opportunity in terms of your giving to society and to   make you proud.  </p><p>Several perks are  set to get back more than what you pay such as the life membership cards in the apiary. </p><p>We have made exceptional payment models even taking the spirit of <a href=""https://globalbeevillage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/We-value-it.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">giving off what you don't use</a> so that we value every bit of the spirit.</p><p>The perk models that we would like to highlight are</p><p>a) Featured perk encouraging you to share your love :</p><p>It is a golden gift that you can give to anyone with love and care. To see details <a href=""https://globalbeevillage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Gift-it-with-love.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here </a></p><p>Bee represents care; bee represents togetherness; bee represents love.  A pure gold and unique gift to your dear one is of value to you, the person who receive it and to us.</p><p>b) 20 second tea:  It is a gift to yourself with a royal treat. This recipe is a test and trial of many years and a perfect blessing in disguise for all those who love tea. The bee touch in that would make you love it for life time. Get it today.</p><p>Carefully crafted to see that each penny you spend is going for a definite purpose that simply finds its way to multiply in our incubation farm.</p><p>Each penny goes for breeding more bees and in the making of the Apiculture Incubation Farm. I am sure of reaching the goal and my target of generating the required fund.</p><p>This project is born.  It takes its wings.  </p><p>I am totally dedicated to make it happen.The closer I am to the target funding,  the faster I reach my goal.   I take pride to spread it with great passion.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>The project is not free from risks and challenges. Every step forward is with caution and to make it work and perform the best.</p><p>What risks and challenges are anticipated and how am I going to face them?</p><p>1.  Hot climate: The extreme hot climate of Dubai in summer can be a challenge to keep the bees survive.  Apis Mellifera (European bee) may not be able to stand it unless proper care is given. Failure in the initial stage itself might make people deter and not propagate the program. </p><p> For this reason, we are going for more of acclimatized local bees - Apis Cerana in our apiary at initial stages,  This should bring better confidence in the farmers as they need less care too.</p><p>2. Penetrating the farming community and make them say ""yes""</p><p>Penetrating the farming community for encouraging bee keeping can be a challenge as they will not be able to assess the pollination benefit. The palm trees being the main crop in Dubai, it might lead to lot of resistance from farmers unless they get a substantial income from bee products.</p><p>Our bee experts have suggested ways and means of overcoming this challenge by propagating to have special honey and value addition using the latest technological advances in beekeeping.</p><p>Some of them can definitely make a break through in beekeeping history.</p><p>3. Acceptance of bee as a friend as against prevailing fear of bee.</p><p>There is a general bee fear and bee hatred in people more in cities compared to villages. The mental block need to be cleared for accepting bees by the people.</p><p>Expecting this we are moving with two simultaneous programs - the educational program in schools and second the awareness programs combined with urban bee promoting.</p><p>4. Educational program - how they will take it?</p><p>Will the schools accept to have bees? Will fear of bees make students not to attend class?</p><p>My research tells it need not bother them and I could conduct a bee class in one of the schools where there are more than 10,000 students. It was a real experience and that gives me more confidence.  We can start the project though a different level if need be.</p><p>​The bee experts from all over the world just standing to support my work gives me enough courage to overcome any challenge that might come in implementing the project.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p> There are many ways to contribute and sometimes it can be more than direct funding.  </p><p>A good heart can influence others and you may not know your power.  Feel free to tell your friends. Pass it on through your communities and social circles - face book, LinkedIn, twitter, instagram, YouTube, G+     and where ever you are present and you have couple of friends.</p><p>It really works when you tell your friends. There are so many good people out there.</p><p>Talk ....talk...talk and make noise around you that convey the message to save bees and this project that works for it. Use the Indiegogo share tool.</p><p>As a contributor you can see yourself from Indiegogo how much you influence in contributing</p><p>And yes, ""if there is a will, there is a way"" is true in helping the world to have more bees.</p><p><strong>Supports:</strong></p><p>The supports and co-operation I get from different parts of the world are great and gives me enough fuel to move ahead strongly. </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","Short SummaryBees decline is paining every one.

My findings that mining bee products like royal jelly, pollen, propolis, bee venom etc., all of which has high commercial value in wellness, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries should make beekeeping a sustainable entrepreneurial choice did find slow results. Again it is disheartening to find people drifting from agriculture.  
A time has now come that bees are declining to the extent of extinct and the global scenario is worse than ever.  Bees are needed not just by one country and bees fly beyond geographical boundaries defying political limits and frames. 
As a first step of my global activity, I founded Global Bee Village, a platform for all the bee enthusiasts and bee experts to join and share their opinion.    
The global reach was made much more practical with the social platforms and with my interest in quest for knowledge on bees of the world. The support from the bee experts from all over the world was overwhelming and many serious discussions over a period made me to enter the 2nd stage of my global operation of breeding more bees to fight against bees decline.Bees For Us Project Bees for us project is born to simply breed more bees involving people and making a system to spontaneously work into and within the people. It is a self sustaining project that goes by its own, once initiated.  Infographic on the project is here. Click to see
Bees for us project is an on the field practical deployment of bees reaching out the pupils, public and farmers .  It is a self-sustaining system. 
Why should it be such an elaborate one with apiary, education, awareness and also deployment of bees in rural and urban areas?  
The simple reason is they are connected to each other. If all those aspects are not handled at a time, the project can fail or drag and there is less time with us. Bees are fast disappearing. What is my back ground?Looking  years back, I have successfully implemented  several co-operative level agricultural operations like forming milk society, agricultural society, educational libraries, and schools . That gives me a pragmatic approach to evolve a system that works continuously and on sustainable basis. It is several years experience and exposure that is its backbone.The base and core strength of the system is forming an Apiculture Incubation Farm that will have :      
 Apiary for show casing,research and sustainability.
 Breeding center for producing more 'resistant' bees. 
 Education facility for imparting knowledge in young generation on bee values.
 Propagation and bee awareness creation in public.
 Support farmers for bee keeping by total bee keeping solution.
 Servicing the urban bee enthusiasts, encouraging and supporting their needs.
An apiary shall give a strong back up in educating, creating awareness, and sustainability and in providing total solution for bee keeping to one and all. There is very few or less professional set up at present in most of the countries that gives a 'total bee keeping solution' under one umbrella. The apiculture incubation farm takes such an initiative.The above said six programs of the incubation farm are most essential to make it work fool proof. In other words, an apiary alone will not make it work; an education system alone cannot break the ice, a farmer approach alone shall not meet the need, a simple urban approach alone cannot solve the issues of bee decline and the strong need to breed more bees.Location:I know that location makes a lot of difference when handling a global issue like that of bees.  It is after days and months of thought that we finally decided to start the incubation farm in Dubai.It is a location to make the message reach the maximum people at minimum time,  Dubai is a country of possibilities and has many firsts in its crown. Dubai has more than 200 nationalities living and working and is a commercial hub to Asian and European markets. Any system can easily percolate down the world from Dubai at ease.It is also important to have the Apiculture Incubation Farm for sustainability and income generation as it involves the need for  cash for practical implementation of breeding more bees and deploying them in the field while mitigating bee decline paving way for unlimited job opportunities  and also showing direction to entrepreneurs connected with bees and agriculture.With my back ground as a chemical engineer, as certified NLP coach and having trained more than 30000 entrepreneurs on different fields with the exceptional motivational skill and drive, the support of people around me gives me great strength to move and work towards this goal and of making it possible to have one bee colony for every 10 person on earth by 2030. Project 'Bees for us' of my concept and plan is one that will make far reaching positive results in  quality agricultural development in every nook and corner.I am sure with people cooperation and drive, the project would take shape soon. Your cooperation and support is essential for that to happen as you are the people, you are my friend and you are my supporter.Every contribution to this novel project, first of its kind, shall show the depth of love for sustaining bees on earth. It Is a need and necessity of every one of us as bee decline is indirectly making every person spend more than what he/she should have due to increase in cost of food, clothing and also in maintaining our vulnerable environment including air and water.Your contribution may be sacrificing a tea, a movie, a gadget that you want to acquire; it may be just giving an unwanted thing off in your house, it may be a day’s earnings or a month’s salary.  It sure is an involvement that you make in keeping the world sustain with bees, for your own food and existence upon this earth. Think of your children. Today, if what you make is for your children,  think of bees decline destroying their future!!  Bees help us to create abundance. They do it just by pollination and maintaining the ecosystem. If it is not you who else will build it? It is not my project; it is our project and I just take the lead. There are several perks and chances to win more than you contribute.  You can contribute even a small amount you decide with the inner feeling of a 'generous giving' for a great cause.Remember, the project is for you; for each one of us. All contributions shall be acknowledged promptly.The System that will continue to work.The Apiculture Incubation Farm is continuously supported by the bee experts from the world (Global Bee Village as the platform) with the bee technologies and best of the bee management practices shall be implemented.Along with the incubation farm, local entrepreneurs are  encouraged to form independent entrepreneurial cells called 'Bee Cells' in hundreds and that further encourages ""BeeVs"".The Apiculture Incubation Farm shall remain as the  mother of all Bee Cells and BeeVs.Infographics for you. Click on.The ImpactThe public contributions are going to change the bees volume in this world. It will sure generate job opportunities and more of our food crop while promoting entrepreneurs. This initiative is expected to make every country tell each farmer in the agricultural sector to have a minimum number of bee colonies for enjoying any government support and subsidies.It will change the bee awareness of people around, as more and more people will start talking about it and know importance of bees.The fundamental education about bees for children will make them learn about the bees as an institution that has many things of value to teach and learn. It will bring more discipline in children and cohesiveness in working together for any project they do. A better citizen with bees education is not far off.Total bee keeping solution will make people own bees and learn more about bee products. It will change their life style and they shall be more healthy and free from sickness. Bees will bring abundance everywhere. There will be more of water and food. Air will be cleaner. Atmosphere will be cooler. With the increased bees, our food will become poison free, our water will get less contaminated.Your contribution is going to make a long term impact in the ecosystem and it is vital.Bringing more of nature in our daily life with bees supporting us all the way and we supporting them to survive, How much fund is required and why? To build an Apiculture Incubation Farm in Dubai,  it needs to have an appropriate agricultural land not far off from cities, hundreds of bee colonies, thousands of bee hives, bee handling tools, bee product processing machinery, bee breeding facilities, bee feeding for lean period, lots of bee keepers to have bee management, bee expertise for training and mining bee products, servicing facility, making a self-learning educational observational bee hive with servicing back up, awareness campaign arrangements with transport facility, on field training and so on.  It all really needs a huge amount.Within the best limitations and for all the things to bring into operation and as per my worked out business plan it shall need  at best  $ 600,000 ; less expenses for this campaign.   
Educational models of self-imparting and 'any time learning' system development is expected to take time and effort as also financial commitment while taking a great responsibility.   
Setting up of an awareness training center and farmers involvement needs a lot of local  interactions and effort.
Urban bee keeping might involve a  collaborative arrangement and ready service facility that needs dealing with emergency situations and risk.
The joy of contribution:The joy of contribution is that cannot be explained in words. You love the bees and  it is a love that you share for the well being of your own children.Each contribution comes with a wonderful opportunity in terms of your giving to society and to   make you proud.  Several perks are  set to get back more than what you pay such as the life membership cards in the apiary. We have made exceptional payment models even taking the spirit of giving off what you don't use so that we value every bit of the spirit.The perk models that we would like to highlight area) Featured perk encouraging you to share your love :It is a golden gift that you can give to anyone with love and care. To see details click here Bee represents care; bee represents togetherness; bee represents love.  A pure gold and unique gift to your dear one is of value to you, the person who receive it and to us.b) 20 second tea:  It is a gift to yourself with a royal treat. This recipe is a test and trial of many years and a perfect blessing in disguise for all those who love tea. The bee touch in that would make you love it for life time. Get it today.Carefully crafted to see that each penny you spend is going for a definite purpose that simply finds its way to multiply in our incubation farm.Each penny goes for breeding more bees and in the making of the Apiculture Incubation Farm. I am sure of reaching the goal and my target of generating the required fund.This project is born.  It takes its wings.  I am totally dedicated to make it happen.The closer I am to the target funding,  the faster I reach my goal.   I take pride to spread it with great passion.Risks & ChallengesThe project is not free from risks and challenges. Every step forward is with caution and to make it work and perform the best.What risks and challenges are anticipated and how am I going to face them?1.  Hot climate: The extreme hot climate of Dubai in summer can be a challenge to keep the bees survive.  Apis Mellifera (European bee) may not be able to stand it unless proper care is given. Failure in the initial stage itself might make people deter and not propagate the program.  For this reason, we are going for more of acclimatized local bees - Apis Cerana in our apiary at initial stages,  This should bring better confidence in the farmers as they need less care too.2. Penetrating the farming community and make them say ""yes""Penetrating the farming community for encouraging bee keeping can be a challenge as they will not be able to assess the pollination benefit. The palm trees being the main crop in Dubai, it might lead to lot of resistance from farmers unless they get a substantial income from bee products.Our bee experts have suggested ways and means of overcoming this challenge by propagating to have special honey and value addition using the latest technological advances in beekeeping.Some of them can definitely make a break through in beekeeping history.3. Acceptance of bee as a friend as against prevailing fear of bee.There is a general bee fear and bee hatred in people more in cities compared to villages. The mental block need to be cleared for accepting bees by the people.Expecting this we are moving with two simultaneous programs - the educational program in schools and second the awareness programs combined with urban bee promoting.4. Educational program - how they will take it?Will the schools accept to have bees? Will fear of bees make students not to attend class?My research tells it need not bother them and I could conduct a bee class in one of the schools where there are more than 10,000 students. It was a real experience and that gives me more confidence.  We can start the project though a different level if need be.​The bee experts from all over the world just standing to support my work gives me enough courage to overcome any challenge that might come in implementing the project. Other Ways You Can Help There are many ways to contribute and sometimes it can be more than direct funding.  A good heart can influence others and you may not know your power.  Feel free to tell your friends. Pass it on through your communities and social circles - face book, LinkedIn, twitter, instagram, YouTube, G+     and where ever you are present and you have couple of friends.It really works when you tell your friends. There are so many good people out there.Talk ....talk...talk and make noise around you that convey the message to save bees and this project that works for it. Use the Indiegogo share tool.As a contributor you can see yourself from Indiegogo how much you influence in contributingAnd yes, ""if there is a will, there is a way"" is true in helping the world to have more bees.Supports:The supports and co-operation I get from different parts of the world are great and gives me enough fuel to move ahead strongly.",1.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Using Carbon Credits instead of Logging</h3>
<p>The resources of these islands have belonged to these people for centuries.  It is time for businesses to stop exploiting the landowners and to find creative ways for the people to benefit more directly and still provide a sound business model for investment and profit for the investors.  Charities don’t work as they don’t have the mentality to provide a structure that will work for the long term as the cash flow requirements are tied to contributions and not to productive, marketplace realities.  The opportunity that we believe we provide is a structure that will allow the resource owners, the people themselves through awareness and education, to direct how their resources are to be used and to benefit directly from their decisions.</p>
<p>The people of New Ireland have never clear cut their land.  They have kept it pristine, beautiful and natural.  It would be a crime for a big multi-national or outside influence to bring the development mentality of the west to projects in this region.  </p>
<p>We have instituted a plan so that the majority of the rain forest doesn't have to be cut and the resource owners, the people of New Ireland will get the maximum benefit.  The process is part of the REDD plus program, whereby countries and companies that have a high carbon usage can purchase carbon credits to offset their carbon footprint.</p>
<p>The typical rainforest offsets 250 tons per hectare of carbon emissions.  We are working towards certifying close to 50,000 hectares of mostly virgin rainforest so that the resource owners receive the maximum benefit.  Once the forest is certified as to the validity of the their carbon offset, then those carbon credits can be sold anywhere from $2.00 to $6.00 a ton.  The close to 100,000 landowners will receive  80% of the value of these funds directly through their land association.</p>
<p>Specifically we need the funds to get the certification of the forests completed by a company called the Gold Standard (they were formed from funding from the UN).  We are having the Forest Survey completed through our local partners and the landowners association in Papua New Guinea.  We paid for consultants from New Zealand to design and monitor the Forest Survey which is going on the last two weeks of July.  The Survey is being done by the Forest Authority of Papua New Guinea according to the standards that were determined under the REDD Plus program.   These expenses we have covered.</p>
<p>The photos that you see on this site are of New Ireland and the concession we are discussing and were taken on July 14th 2016 on a fly-over of the island by the New Zealand consultants.  The purpose of the fund is to pay for the costs associated with the Gold Standard certification.  The certification will increase the value of the carbon credits from the low of $2.00 to around $6.00, makes the selling of the credits easier and more reliable and provides the guarantee of the value that the credits need.</p>
<p>The program could become a pilot program for all of the rainforest in PNG.  PNG is home to one of the last great expanses of tropical rainforests in the world.  We could end up creating an O2 haven  to combat global warming and offset the carbon pollution that is going on world wide.</p>
<p>We are heavily involved in the process, we didn't anticipate the need or the costs of getting a third party certification to be able to market the carbon credits effectively.    </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> So if you contribute to our fund, you will be doing the following;</p>
<ol>
<li>Saving a minimum of 70% of the rain forest on the southern half of New Ireland.</li>
<li>Creating through the program, a direct benefit to close to 100,000 native landowners</li>
<li>Fighting global warming in a real way that still provides an economic benefit for the landowners.  Here in Oxford, MS, in the past three years, there have been malls, office complexes, apartment complexes and residential areas all clear cut to make way for the ""progress"".  No one here thinks about the environmental impact because its part of the economic development.   People of New Ireland deserve to have the same economic opportunity.  If instead of cutting their forests, they can keep the forests and still get an economic value, its win for them financially, its a win for the environment and its a win for the fight against global warming.</li>
<li>The program creates a template for other regions of Papua New Guinea to emulate.  The entire forest is over 200,000 hectares.  The credits only apply to areas that can be logged economically today.  The diminishing resources of exotic hardwood timber and the population growth could mean in 10 or 15 years that the entire area could be logged using techniques like helicopter logging.  Currently it would be too expensive but in the future it may not.  This program would discourage that land utilization and would provide an ongoing opportunity.</li>
</ol>
<p>The use of proceeds for the $75,000 is the following;</p>
<ol>
<li>The cost of preparing and proving the application</li>
<li>Consultants that will be needed to assist with the verification process</li>
<li>Travel to PNG as needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>If funds aren't raised totally, whatever is raised will go towards the goal of getting the validation on the forest content, the amount of carbon offsets that can be verified and the completion of this aspect of the project.</p>
<p>If we are successful in this process and are able to sell the carbon credits, NIHT Incorporated will return your donation and will return an additional 20% for you as thank you for your assistance in this endeavor. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p> There are risks in everything that you undertake, especially when working in a third world country.  We have done the following to mitigate the risks;</p>
<ol>
<li>Started the project with the landowners over two and a half years ago.</li>
<li>We have worked to mitigate the risks by working first with the landowners, then the chiefs and heads of the clan, then the local level government, then the provincial government and lastly with the Forestry Authority, the official branch of the Papua New Guinea government.  We have documented support from all of these entities.</li>
<li>Papua New Guinea is new to the REDD Plus credits and the use of Carbon Credits.  Having an NGO like us perform the work and develop the process saves them money, provides a blue print for other areas of the country and moves the process along by more than 2 years.  The PNG government target for REDD credits is 2019.</li>
<li>More information about the exact process, copies of approvals, contracts etc. are explained on our website, <a href=""http://www.NIHTInc.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.NIHTInc.com</a> </li>

Saving a minimum of 70% of the rain forest on the southern half of New Ireland.
Creating through the program, a direct benefit to close to 100,000 native landowners
Fighting global warming in a real way that still provides an economic benefit for the landowners.  Here in Oxford, MS, in the past three years, there have been malls, office complexes, apartment complexes and residential areas all clear cut to make way for the ""progress"".  No one here thinks about the environmental impact because its part of the economic development.   People of New Ireland deserve to have the same economic opportunity.  If instead of cutting their forests, they can keep the forests and still get an economic value, its win for them financially, its a win for the environment and its a win for the fight against global warming.
The program creates a template for other regions of Papua New Guinea to emulate.  The entire forest is over 200,000 hectares.  The credits only apply to areas that can be logged economically today.  The diminishing resources of exotic hardwood timber and the population growth could mean in 10 or 15 years that the entire area could be logged using techniques like helicopter logging.  Currently it would be too expensive but in the future it may not.  This program would discourage that land utilization and would provide an ongoing opportunity.

The use of proceeds for the $75,000 is the following;

The cost of preparing and proving the application
Consultants that will be needed to assist with the verification process
Travel to PNG as needed.

If funds aren't raised totally, whatever is raised will go towards the goal of getting the validation on the forest content, the amount of carbon offsets that can be verified and the completion of this aspect of the project.
If we are successful in this process and are able to sell the carbon credits, NIHT Incorporated will return your donation and will return an additional 20% for you as thank you for your assistance in this endeavor. 
Risks & Challenges

 There are risks in everything that you undertake, especially when working in a third world country.  We have done the following to mitigate the risks;

Started the project with the landowners over two and a half years ago.
We have worked to mitigate the risks by working first with the landowners, then the chiefs and heads of the clan, then the local level government, then the provincial government and lastly with the Forestry Authority, the official branch of the Papua New Guinea government.  We have documented support from all of these entities.
Papua New Guinea is new to the REDD Plus credits and the use of Carbon Credits.  Having an NGO like us perform the work and develop the process saves them money, provides a blue print for other areas of the country and moves the process along by more than 2 years.  The PNG government target for REDD credits is 2019.

<p><strong>Supporting this project you can achieve two goals in a single act: the production of a video-documentary and the start-up of a coffee plantation in the quilombola community of Linharinho. And maybe in a very close future you could receive the best coffee you have ever invested in! </strong></p>
<p><strong>Obrigado for your help.</strong></p>
<p>In the Sapê do Norte, in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, the local people of <u><strong>Quilombolas</strong> </u>- descendants of black slaves - are marginalized and eradicated, along with the local flora, by corporations of paper and oil, a scenario sadly common to many other areas on the planet where monoculture is dominant over local cultures, ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>The '<strong>Retomadas</strong>', the Quilombola re-appropriations, are formed by people living in the quilombo (place of refuge) and that are surrounded by eucalyptus and sugar cane monocultures and oil stations. In these areas, communities work to reconvert soil, increasing biodiversity, which has suffered degradation, deforestation and pollution for over fifty years; trying to produce healthy, sustainable food that will ensure their survival in their native lands.</p>
<p>In the '70s, the Norwegian corporation Aracruz, now a brazilian company with the name of Fibria - world's first producer of cellulose and paper - illegally bought vast areas of tropical forest from the dictatorship to promote the idea of development based on large-scale monoculture. <strong>Eucalyptus</strong>, native of Australia, thanks to the warm climate, in Brazil reaches 25m in only six years. Along with soy and sugar cane, is one of the great crops of brazilian agribusiness, which takes millions of hectares of ancient land and historically populated by indigenous peoples and Quilombolas, as in the case of Sapê do Norte region.</p>
<p>There are <strong>1,200</strong> <strong>families</strong> living in the region (12,000 in the '70s), but life in this green desert of plants is difficult. The Quilombola people lived on subsistence: they hunted, fished, harvested fruit and medicines and farmed the land in one of the most fertile areas of the planet. But today nothing grows among eucalyptus trees. Eucalyptus monoculture makes the soil poor, drains watercourses and contaminates with pesticides and herbicides used in plantations destroying biodiversity.</p>
<p><strong>The Brazilian Constitution declares that these lands belong to traditional peoples</strong> and that it's duty of the state to recognize their property, giving priority and guaranteeing subsistence activities. The case of the illegal presence of Fibria in Quilombola territory represents yet another case of corruption and failure of public policies in Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>Food traditions are getting lost</strong>. The nutritional values of a diversified food and the result of the ground work as well. Along with dendê oil, cassava manioc plant and the simple daily rice and beans, the cultivation of these foods is in danger. Today, the presence of eucalyptus monoculture in the lands of Sapê do Norte is identified as the main cause of food and nutrition insecurity in these communities. The processing of land use has caused an intense process of deconstruction of traditional ways of life and of agri-ecological production system that guaranteed a diversified and abundant diet. This situation has led to a high degree of monetary dependence among households: most of food currently consumed is bought in stores in neighbouring cities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>The brazilian background reported in the documentary aims to offer a starting point for reflecting on the great strength of bottom-up movements and on populations that fight against economic interests of corporations and governments with corrupt democracies.</p>
<p><strong>Joice and Antonio</strong> live in the community of <strong>Linharinho</strong>, where they were born. But for over twenty years they have been struggling to have their place to live. The village was invaded by monoculture of eucalyptus, which dried rivers, extinct animals, poisoned people and led the conflict. Here, along with many others, they try to resist and heal a land that belongs to them.</p>
<p>Food security is threatened by the lack of a healthy food supply. Sustainable agriculture and local traditions are being compromised in the name of profit. The livelihoods of the inhabitants are rapidly decreasing. </p>
<p>Joice and Antonio, with their children, have '<strong>retomado</strong>' (taken back) a land dominated by eucalyptus to build their home and their agri-ecological project: <strong>a small permacultural coffee productive system</strong>. An ecological experimentation to produce coffee - a historical culture of tropical areas - through sustainable practices of consociation, biofertilizers, soil nutrition and increase of soil fertility, in order to have a return to an ecological production of a local product.</p>
<p>Joice says: -""he ""<strong>Agricoltura Agroecológica goal is to produce, in the medium term, coffee and other plants from family agriculture of the highest quality</strong> using land resources for a healthy and sustainable food quality""</p>
<p>The earth is ready. In recent months, the soil has been prepared to accommodate coffee plants, providing organic matter and preventing erosion, soil runoff and combating evapotranspiration. Completely natural production will also ensure higher market yields.</p>
<p>There are hoes and the season is coming up: <strong>Help Joice and Antonio for their first harvest! Support the cause and help promote the right to food security!</strong></p>

E forse in un futuro molto vicino potresti ricevere anche il miglior caffè in cui tu abbia mai investito!</strong></p><p><strong>Obrigado per il tuo aiuto!</strong></p><p>Nel Brasile dei disordini socio-politici e delle continue pressioni che minacciano l’Amazzonia, molte persone e foreste native hanno dovuto lasciare il posto alla monocoltura di eucalipto.</p><p>Perchè? Per produrre la cellulosa, materia prima della carta che utilizziamo tutti i giorni: fogli, carta igienica, riviste, carta fotografica.</p><p>Dove? Nel Sapê do Norte, nello stato di Espírito Santo, in Brasile, dove le popolazioni locali dei <strong>Quilombola</strong> sono emarginate ed estirpate, insieme alla flora locale, dalle multinazionali della carta e del petrolio; uno scenario purtroppo comune a molte altre zone del pianeta dove la monocultura si impone prepotentemente su culture, ecosistemi e biodiversità locali.</p><p>Le <strong>retomadas</strong>, le riappropriazioni Quilombola, sono formate da persone che vivono nel quilombo (luogo di rifugio) e che sono circondate dalle monocolture di eucalipto e canna da zucchero e dalle stazioni petrolifere. In queste aree, le comunità lavorano per la riconversione del suolo, aumentando la biodiversità che da oltre cinquant’anni soffre degradazione, deforestazione e inquinamento. Cercando di produrre un cibo sano, sostenibile e che ne garantisca la sopravvivenza nelle loro terre native.</p><p>Negli anni ‘70 la multinazionale norvegese Aracruz, ora impresa brasiliana col nome di Fibria - prima produttrice mondiale di cellulosa e carta, acquista illegalmente dalla dittatura vaste zone di foresta tropicale per promuovere l'idea di sviluppo basato sulla monocoltura in larga scala.</p><p>Grazie al clima favorevole, in Brasile questa pianta raggiunge 25m in soli sei anni. L’<strong>eucalipto</strong>, insieme alla soia e alla canna da zucchero, è una delle grandi colture dell'agrobusiness brasiliano che si prende milioni di ettari di terre antiche e storicamente occupate da popolazioni indigene o discendenti di schiavi neri, i quilombola, come nel caso della regione del Sapê do Norte.</p><p>Nella regione vivono <strong>1.200 famiglie</strong> (erano 12.000 negli anni '70), ma la vita in questo deserto verde di piante è difficile. Le popolazioni quilombola vivevano di sussistenza: cacciavano, pescavano, raccoglievano i frutti e coltivavano la terra di una delle zone più fertili del pianeta. Ma oggi tra gli eucalipti non cresce niente. La monocoltura di eucalipto lascia il terreno povero, prosciuga i corsi d’acqua e inquina con i pesticidi ed erbicidi usati nelle piantagioni.</p><p><strong>La Costituzione dichiara che la terra appartiene alle popolazioni tradizionali</strong> e che è dovere dello stato riconoscerne la proprietà, dando precedenza e garantendo le attività di sussistenza. Il caso della presenza illegale della Fibria in territorio quilombola rappresenta l'ennesimo caso di corruzione e fallimento delle politiche pubbliche in Brasile.</p><p><strong>Le tradizioni alimentari stanno andando perse</strong>. I valori nutritivi di un cibo diversificato e frutto del lavoro della terra pure. Insieme all’olio di dendê, alla manioca e al semplice e quotidiano riso e fagioli la coltivazione di questi alimenti è in pericolo. Oggi la presenza della monocoltura di eucalipto nelle terre del Sapê do Norte è individuata come prima causa di insicurezza alimentare e nutrizionale di tali comunità. La trasformazione d’uso della terra ha causato un intenso processo di destrutturazione dei modi di vita tradizionali e del sistema di produzione agroecologico che garantiva un’alimentazione diversificata e abbondante. Questa situazione ha portato le famiglie ad una grande dipendenza monetaria: la maggior parte degli alimenti consumati attualmente viene comprata nei supermercati delle città vicine.</p><h3>il Progetto</h3><p>Il contesto brasiliano riportato nel documentario intende offrire un punto di partenza per riflettere sulla grande forza dei movimenti dal basso verso l'alto e sulle popolazioni che lottano contro gli interessi economici delle imprese e dei governi con democrazie corrotte.</p><p><strong>Joice e Antonio</strong> vivono nella comunità di <strong>Linharinho</strong>, dove sono nati. Ma per oltre vent'anni hanno lottato per avere il loro posto dove vivere. Il villaggio è stato invaso dalla monocoltura di eucalipto, che ha prosciugato fiumi, estinto animali, avvelenato la popolazione e innescato il conflitto. Qui, insieme a molti altri, cercano di resistere e guarire una terra che appartiene a loro.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524511092/mxj8z3a7dudtaxw02iie.jpg"" src=""""/>   </p><p>La sicurezza alimentare è minacciata dalla mancanza di un approvvigionamento alimentare sano. L'agricoltura sostenibile e le tradizioni locali vengono compromesse in nome del profitto. I mezzi di sussistenza degli abitanti stanno rapidamente diminuendo. </p><p>Joice e Antonio, con i loro figli, hanno ""<strong>retomado</strong>"" (ripreso, rioccupato) una terra dominata dall'eucalipto per costruire la loro casa e il loro progetto agro-ecologico: <strong>un piccolo sistema produttivo permaculturale di caffè</strong>.

As populações quilombolas viviam de subsistência: elas caçavam, pescavam, recolhiam os frutos e cultivavam a terra de uma das áreas mais férteis do planeta. Mas hoje em dia nada cresce entre os eucaliptos.

ENG
Supporting this project you can achieve two goals in a single act: the production of a video-documentary and the start-up of a coffee plantation in the quilombola community of Linharinho. And maybe in a very close future you could receive the best coffee you have ever invested in! 
Obrigado for your help.
In the Sapê do Norte, in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, the local people of Quilombolas - descendants of black slaves - are marginalized and eradicated, along with the local flora, by corporations of paper and oil, a scenario sadly common to many other areas on the planet where monoculture is dominant over local cultures, ecosystems and biodiversity.
The 'Retomadas', the Quilombola re-appropriations, are formed by people living in the quilombo (place of refuge) and that are surrounded by eucalyptus and sugar cane monocultures and oil stations. In these areas, communities work to reconvert soil, increasing biodiversity, which has suffered degradation, deforestation and pollution for over fifty years; trying to produce healthy, sustainable food that will ensure their survival in their native lands.
In the '70s, the Norwegian corporation Aracruz, now a brazilian company with the name of Fibria - world's first producer of cellulose and paper - illegally bought vast areas of tropical forest from the dictatorship to promote the idea of development based on large-scale monoculture. Eucalyptus, native of Australia, thanks to the warm climate, in Brazil reaches 25m in only six years. Along with soy and sugar cane, is one of the great crops of brazilian agribusiness, which takes millions of hectares of ancient land and historically populated by indigenous peoples and Quilombolas, as in the case of Sapê do Norte region.
There are 1,200 families living in the region (12,000 in the '70s), but life in this green desert of plants is difficult. The Quilombola people lived on subsistence: they hunted, fished, harvested fruit and medicines and farmed the land in one of the most fertile areas of the planet. But today nothing grows among eucalyptus trees. Eucalyptus monoculture makes the soil poor, drains watercourses and contaminates with pesticides and herbicides used in plantations destroying biodiversity.
The Brazilian Constitution declares that these lands belong to traditional peoples and that it's duty of the state to recognize their property, giving priority and guaranteeing subsistence activities. The case of the illegal presence of Fibria in Quilombola territory represents yet another case of corruption and failure of public policies in Brazil.
Food traditions are getting lost. The nutritional values of a diversified food and the result of the ground work as well. Along with dendê oil, cassava manioc plant and the simple daily rice and beans, the cultivation of these foods is in danger. Today, the presence of eucalyptus monoculture in the lands of Sapê do Norte is identified as the main cause of food and nutrition insecurity in these communities. The processing of land use has caused an intense process of deconstruction of traditional ways of life and of agri-ecological production system that guaranteed a diversified and abundant diet. This situation has led to a high degree of monetary dependence among households: most of food currently consumed is bought in stores in neighbouring cities.

The Project
The brazilian background reported in the documentary aims to offer a starting point for reflecting on the great strength of bottom-up movements and on populations that fight against economic interests of corporations and governments with corrupt democracies.
Joice and Antonio live in the community of Linharinho, where they were born. But for over twenty years they have been struggling to have their place to live. The village was invaded by monoculture of eucalyptus, which dried rivers, extinct animals, poisoned people and led the conflict. Here, along with many others, they try to resist and heal a land that belongs to them.
Food security is threatened by the lack of a healthy food supply. Sustainable agriculture and local traditions are being compromised in the name of profit. The livelihoods of the inhabitants are rapidly decreasing. 
Joice and Antonio, with their children, have 'retomado' (taken back) a land dominated by eucalyptus to build their home and their agri-ecological project: a small permacultural coffee productive system. An ecological experimentation to produce coffee - a historical culture of tropical areas - through sustainable practices of consociation, biofertilizers, soil nutrition and increase of soil fertility, in order to have a return to an ecological production of a local product.
Joice says: -""he ""Agricoltura Agroecológica goal is to produce, in the medium term, coffee and other plants from family agriculture of the highest quality using land resources for a healthy and sustainable food quality""
The earth is ready. In recent months, the soil has been prepared to accommodate coffee plants, providing organic matter and preventing erosion, soil runoff and combating evapotranspiration. Completely natural production will also ensure higher market yields.
There are hoes and the season is coming up: Help Joice and Antonio for their first harvest! Support the cause and help promote the right to food security!

You can support the project with a contribution and the budget you want.
 
Anyone who choose to support this project, regardless of the amount donated, will be included in the credits with a huge Thank you for contributing to the project success.
The project is an independent development, almost totally self-financed!Part of the funds raised to support us will be used to cover administration costs, insurance cover for transports and technical equipment and all the other extraordinary expenses.
Support of those who believe that independent information is today more than ever a good ""investment"" is crucial
Support us and we will be grateful for that,
Thanks to All!

ITACAFFÈ SOSTENIBILE NELLE PIANTAGIONI DI EUCALIPTOAiuta la comunità Quilombola che soffre di insicurezza alimentare a causa dell'industria della carta.  Sostenendo questo progetto contribuirai a due obiettivi con un solo gesto: verrà prodotto un video-documentario sulla situazione drammatica delle comunità brasiliane espropriate delle proprie terre e verrà avviata una piantagione di caffè nella comunità quilombola di Linharinho. E forse in un futuro molto vicino potresti ricevere anche il miglior caffè in cui tu abbia mai investito!Obrigado per il tuo aiuto!Nel Brasile dei disordini socio-politici e delle continue pressioni che minacciano l’Amazzonia, molte persone e foreste native hanno dovuto lasciare il posto alla monocoltura di eucalipto.Perchè? Per produrre la cellulosa, materia prima della carta che utilizziamo tutti i giorni: fogli, carta igienica, riviste, carta fotografica.Dove? Nel Sapê do Norte, nello stato di Espírito Santo, in Brasile, dove le popolazioni locali dei Quilombola sono emarginate ed estirpate, insieme alla flora locale, dalle multinazionali della carta e del petrolio; uno scenario purtroppo comune a molte altre zone del pianeta dove la monocultura si impone prepotentemente su culture, ecosistemi e biodiversità locali.Le retomadas, le riappropriazioni Quilombola, sono formate da persone che vivono nel quilombo (luogo di rifugio) e che sono circondate dalle monocolture di eucalipto e canna da zucchero e dalle stazioni petrolifere. In queste aree, le comunità lavorano per la riconversione del suolo, aumentando la biodiversità che da oltre cinquant’anni soffre degradazione, deforestazione e inquinamento. Cercando di produrre un cibo sano, sostenibile e che ne garantisca la sopravvivenza nelle loro terre native.Negli anni ‘70 la multinazionale norvegese Aracruz, ora impresa brasiliana col nome di Fibria - prima produttrice mondiale di cellulosa e carta, acquista illegalmente dalla dittatura vaste zone di foresta tropicale per promuovere l'idea di sviluppo basato sulla monocoltura in larga scala.Grazie al clima favorevole, in Brasile questa pianta raggiunge 25m in soli sei anni. L’eucalipto, insieme alla soia e alla canna da zucchero, è una delle grandi colture dell'agrobusiness brasiliano che si prende milioni di ettari di terre antiche e storicamente occupate da popolazioni indigene o discendenti di schiavi neri, i quilombola, come nel caso della regione del Sapê do Norte.Nella regione vivono 1.200 famiglie (erano 12.000 negli anni '70), ma la vita in questo deserto verde di piante è difficile. Le popolazioni quilombola vivevano di sussistenza: cacciavano, pescavano, raccoglievano i frutti e coltivavano la terra di una delle zone più fertili del pianeta. Ma oggi tra gli eucalipti non cresce niente. La monocoltura di eucalipto lascia il terreno povero, prosciuga i corsi d’acqua e inquina con i pesticidi ed erbicidi usati nelle piantagioni.La Costituzione dichiara che la terra appartiene alle popolazioni tradizionali e che è dovere dello stato riconoscerne la proprietà, dando precedenza e garantendo le attività di sussistenza. Il caso della presenza illegale della Fibria in territorio quilombola rappresenta l'ennesimo caso di corruzione e fallimento delle politiche pubbliche in Brasile.Le tradizioni alimentari stanno andando perse. I valori nutritivi di un cibo diversificato e frutto del lavoro della terra pure. Insieme all’olio di dendê, alla manioca e al semplice e quotidiano riso e fagioli la coltivazione di questi alimenti è in pericolo. Oggi la presenza della monocoltura di eucalipto nelle terre del Sapê do Norte è individuata come prima causa di insicurezza alimentare e nutrizionale di tali comunità. La trasformazione d’uso della terra ha causato un intenso processo di destrutturazione dei modi di vita tradizionali e del sistema di produzione agroecologico che garantiva un’alimentazione diversificata e abbondante. Questa situazione ha portato le famiglie ad una grande dipendenza monetaria: la maggior parte degli alimenti consumati attualmente viene comprata nei supermercati delle città vicine.il ProgettoIl contesto brasiliano riportato nel documentario intende offrire un punto di partenza per riflettere sulla grande forza dei movimenti dal basso verso l'alto e sulle popolazioni che lottano contro gli interessi economici delle imprese e dei governi con democrazie corrotte.Joice e Antonio vivono nella comunità di Linharinho, dove sono nati. Ma per oltre vent'anni hanno lottato per avere il loro posto dove vivere. Il villaggio è stato invaso dalla monocoltura di eucalipto, che ha prosciugato fiumi, estinto animali, avvelenato la popolazione e innescato il conflitto. Qui, insieme a molti altri, cercano di resistere e guarire una terra che appartiene a loro.   La sicurezza alimentare è minacciata dalla mancanza di un approvvigionamento alimentare sano. L'agricoltura sostenibile e le tradizioni locali vengono compromesse in nome del profitto. I mezzi di sussistenza degli abitanti stanno rapidamente diminuendo. Joice e Antonio, con i loro figli, hanno ""retomado"" (ripreso, rioccupato) una terra dominata dall'eucalipto per costruire la loro casa e il loro progetto agro-ecologico: un piccolo sistema produttivo permaculturale di caffè. Una sperimentazione ecologica per produrre caffè -coltura storica di queste aree tropicali - attraverso pratiche sostenibili di consociazione, biofertilizzanti, nutrimento del suolo e aumento della fertilità, al fine di tornare alla produzione ecologica di un prodotto locale.Joice dice: ""L'obiettivo di Agricoltura Agroecológica è quello di produrre, nel medio termine, caffè e altre piante da agricoltura familiare di altissima qualità utilizzando le risorse del territorio per una qualità alimentare sana e sostenibile"".La terra è pronta. Negli ultimi mesi, il suolo è stato preparato per accogliere le piante di caffè, fornendo materia organica e prevenendo l'erosione, il dilavamento del suolo e combattendo contro l'evapotraspirazione. Una produzione completamente naturale garantirà anche rese di mercato più elevate.Ci sono le zappe e la stagione sta arrivando: Aiuta Joice e Antonio per il loro primo raccolto! Sostieni la causa e aiuta a promuovere il diritto alla sicurezza alimentare!Puoi sostenere il progetto con il contributo e il budget che desideri.Chiunque scelga di sostenere questo progetto, indipendentemente dall'importo donato, sarà incluso nei crediti con un grande ringraziamento per aver contribuito al successo del progetto.Il progetto è uno sviluppo indipendente, quasi totalmente autofinanziato!Una parte dei fondi raccolti a nostro sostegno sarà utilizzata per coprire i costi amministrativi, la copertura assicurativa per i trasporti e le attrezzature tecniche e tutte le altre spese straordinarie.Il sostegno di coloro che credono che l'informazione indipendente sia oggi più che mai un buon ""investimento"" è fondamentaleAppoggiaci e te ne saremo grati,Grazie a tutti!Se ti interessa e vuoi approfondire l'argomento clicca qui:https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilombohttp://www.hlrn.org/news.php?id=p2hoZw==#.Wt5KitNuZQIhttps://ejatlas.org/conflict/eucalyptus-plantations-aracruz-celulose-brazil Chi siamo?Simone TinelliCooperante di formazione, ha studiato sviluppo sostenibile del territorio e permacultura focalizzandosi in progetti di sviluppo rurale legati all’agricoltura familiare.

In questi anni ha collaborato con la ONG brasiliana FASE sullo studio di programmi di sviluppo territoriale sostenibile volti a promuovere pratiche agroecologiche nelle coltivazioni di piccola scala e al riconoscimento culturale delle tradizioni locali.Andrea CorraoHa lavorato nel mondo della produzione video, si avvicina per la prima volta al mondo delle ONG e della cooperazione internazionale, con un interesse sempre più crescente per la permacultura, le pratiche del vivere sostenibile e la conoscenza delle situazioni di razzismo ambientale e di dinamiche di sfruttamento delle comunità autoctone in giro per il mondo. BRANo Brasil dos protestos sociopolíticos e das contínuas pressões que ameaçam a Amazônia, muitas pessoas e florestas tiveram que deixar o passo para a monocultura de eucalipto.Porque? Para produzir celulose, a matéria-prima do papel que utilizamos cada dia: folhas, papel higiênico, magazines, papel fotográfico.No Sapê do Norte, no estado do Espírito Santo, onde as populações locais Quilombolas são continuamente marginalizadas e extirpadas, junto com a flora local, pelas multinacionais de papel e petróleo; um cenário infelizmente comum em várias regiões do planeta onde a monocultura se impõe fortemente sobre culturas, ecossistemas e biodiversidade locais.A retomada quilombola, é formada por pessoas que vivem no quilombo ( lugar de refugio), e que estão cercados pelo monocultivo de eucalipto(celulose), cana de açúcar,complexo petroleiro, empresas que oprime todas comunidades que aqui existem, muitas famílias já foram embora de várias localidades, temos muitas escassez de água, as retomadas quilombolas são áreas que estão sendo retomadas pelos quilombolas e nestas áreas vem sendo feito vários trabalhos de reconversão de solo, solo estes que por mais de 50 anos sofreram com a degradação, desmatamentos, contaminação do solo, dentre outros, enumeras famílias tem trabalhado para conseguir tirar alimentos de boa qualidade e sustentável dessas áreas para sobreviverem.Nos anos 70, em tempos de governo ditatorial, a multinacional norueguêsa Aracruz - agora empresa brasileira com o nome de Fibria, primeira produtora mundial de celulose e papel - compra ilegalmente da ditadura várias áreas de floresta nativa para promover a ideia de desenvolvimento baseada na monocultura em grande escala.Graças ao clima favorável, no Brasil esta planta atinge 25m em apenas seis anos. O eucalipto, junto com a soja e a cana de açúcar, é um dos maiores cultivos do agronegócio brasileiro, tomando milhões de hectares de terras antigas e historicamente ocupadas por populações indígenas ou quilombolas, como no caso da região do Sapê do Norte.Na região  moram 1.200 famílias (12.000 nos anos ‘70), mas a vida nesse deserto verde de plantas é difícil.

<li>Purchase of 12 bison from the Native tribe of Stevens Village;</li>
<li>Construction of crates</li>
<li>Veterinary expenses in the United States</li>
<li>Truck rental for animal transportation</li>

</ul><p> </p><p><strong>Push goals and long-term development plans </strong></p><p>We set the campaign goal to flexible. Bison is the key animal for the Pleistocene Park and we are intending to get animals to the park even if that would lead to complicated financial situation for the Park</p><ul>
<li>$60,000 is the absolute minimum to make this happen.  It will cover around half of the airfare.  This will create financial hardship for me but we will survive.  </li>
<li>$98,000 will cover most charter airplane expenses and leave Pleistocene Park on a more even keel moving forward.  </li>
<li>$200,000 We will also organize transportion of additional animals to the Pleistocene park from within Russia, including reindeer, horses, elk, boars. </li>
<li>$600,000 We will launch an expedition to bring a herd of at least 20 musk ox. We will explore other options of Arctic adapted animals and bring them. We will improve infrastructure to support the additional animals. Within 2-3 years we would be able to seriously transform the land within current fences.</li>
<li>$1,000,000 We will extend the Pleistocene Park in every direction. There will be more land, more animals introduced, more people participating in our project.</li>
<li>$3,000,000 We will complete the ecosystem by introducing predators. We will have enough prey to maintain sustainable population of predators in the Park: wolves and potentially Amur tigers.</li>
<li>$10,000,000 + We will transport 1000+ bison by ship to the Pleistocene Park region. This is the scale that will be necessary to begin fully implementing restoration of the high productive steppes and stabilize melting permafrost on a large scale.</li>
<li>$1 billion  is the rough estimate of the total price for our civilization to restore real wild nature on a continental scale and have actual impact on climate. While not a small amount of money it is one of the largest environmental impacts possible for a sum well within the budget of a wealthy individual or a corporation. Large infrastructure projects like bridges, dams or clean energy programs are in this range or larger.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p><p>Transportation of Animals to the Pleistocene Park:</p><p>We have prepared a logistical plan which will allow safe and comfortable trip for the animals. This is our 8th expedition to bring animals to Pleistocene Park. Some of these trips have been longer and more complicated and all have been successful.</p><p>All animals in this trip will be transported in individual stalls. They will have enough space to stand up and lay down for rest. The design of the containers will allow animals to have access to enough fresh air, water and forage.

It will trigger catastrophic global warming. We’re creating a northern Serengeti to stop that from happening.Pleistocene Park is a proof of concept, a public demonstration, a landscape scale art project and a philosophy of rational co-existence between humans and nature.Here in the most remote corner of Siberia my father, Sergey Zimov, and I are reviving the ice age “Mammoth Steppe” ecosystem. Re-wilding this vast area of the Arctic will not only create a northern Serengeti, but most importantly, today, is a vital tool to mitigate global climate change. As climate warms, permafrost here in the Arctic is starting to melt. It will soon unlock huge carbon stocks and trigger a catastrophic global warming feedback loop. Natural grasslands, maintained by numerous grazing animals, have the capacity to both slow climate warming and prevent permafrost from melting.Me, Nikita Zimov, and my father, Sergey ZimovWe’ve already starting transforming the land, with our real world prototype.For the past 20 years my family has spent a big portion of our time and all available finances to create Pleistocene Park. Currently we have over 90 large herbivores in the Park, including cold adapted Yakutian horses, moose, musk ox, reindeer, wisent, yaks and sheeps. These animals have shown that it is possible to transform ecosystems and reestablish high productivity grasslands by reintroducing large herbivores.  We have fenced 20 square kilometers of land, built infrastructure and installed monitoring equipment. To bring animals to the Park we have mounted extreme expeditions ourselves. We traveled by small boat through the Arctic Ocean to Wrangel Island and from the Mongolian border with a 4x4 military transport truck, driving thousands of kilometers on frozen rivers through roadless wilderness.Musk ox at the Pleistocene ParkTo stand a chance of mitigating global warming on a much bigger scale we need your help to take the park to the next level!However, for mitigating global warming, the size of the Park is not enough. This crowdfunding campaign is one of our first attempts to invite other people to participate in our project and an important step towards turning the modern Arctic into a northern Serengeti and stop permafrost degradation on a big scale.Join us in creating a world where we harness nature to protect the planet we live on. Last year we ran a crowdfunding campaign to bring yaks and bison to Pleistocene Park.  With the help of 750 backers we successfully raised $106,000.

An Artists rendering of what the mammoth steppe looked like What is Pleistocene Park reviving? During the last Ice Age, steppes with millions of mammoths, bison, horses, reindeers, tigers, wolves and numerous other animals occupied vast landscapes, spanning from Spain to Canada and from the Arctic islands to China.Being the world biggest biome, mammoth steppe was as productive as the modern African savannah.

We already bought twelve one-year-old American plains bison from a Native American Village in Alaska. Animals has already passed all veterinary tests and now preserved in the quarantine. From there animals will be placed into the individual  crates, loaded on the truck and taken to the international airport of Fairbanks. From there we will charter the airplane to fly to the easternmost city of Anadyr’ in Russia, where animals would clear customs and continue on the same plane to the home town of the Pleistocene Park – Cherskii. There another truck would take bison to the park. Bison was a keystone specie in the mammoth steppe ecosystem in the past and we expect it to take dominant role in the modern high productive steppes as well.The bison transport route from Alaska to the Pleistocene ParkHow will the crowdfunding money be spent? Our goal is to raise 98,000 dollars. This money would be added to the money left from our first crowdfunding campaign and personal fund of the Pleistocene Park to pay for the following item:
Purchase of 12 bison from the Native tribe of Stevens Village;
Construction of crates
Veterinary expenses in the United States
Truck rental for animal transportation
Custom fees
Airplane rental with all expenses related to the flight both within USA and Russia.
Miscellaneous trip expenses, including 1-3 people travelling with the animals, 
Expense of manufacturing and delivery of crowdfunding campaign rewards 
Taxes, bank and legal fees
 Push goals and long-term development plans We set the campaign goal to flexible. Bison is the key animal for the Pleistocene Park and we are intending to get animals to the park even if that would lead to complicated financial situation for the Park
$60,000 is the absolute minimum to make this happen.  It will cover around half of the airfare.  This will create financial hardship for me but we will survive.  
$98,000 will cover most charter airplane expenses and leave Pleistocene Park on a more even keel moving forward.  
$200,000 We will also organize transportion of additional animals to the Pleistocene park from within Russia, including reindeer, horses, elk, boars. 
$600,000 We will launch an expedition to bring a herd of at least 20 musk ox. We will explore other options of Arctic adapted animals and bring them. We will improve infrastructure to support the additional animals. Within 2-3 years we would be able to seriously transform the land within current fences.
$1,000,000 We will extend the Pleistocene Park in every direction. There will be more land, more animals introduced, more people participating in our project.
$3,000,000 We will complete the ecosystem by introducing predators. We will have enough prey to maintain sustainable population of predators in the Park: wolves and potentially Amur tigers.
$10,000,000 + We will transport 1000+ bison by ship to the Pleistocene Park region. This is the scale that will be necessary to begin fully implementing restoration of the high productive steppes and stabilize melting permafrost on a large scale.
$1 billion  is the rough estimate of the total price for our civilization to restore real wild nature on a continental scale and have actual impact on climate. While not a small amount of money it is one of the largest environmental impacts possible for a sum well within the budget of a wealthy individual or a corporation. Large infrastructure projects like bridges, dams or clean energy programs are in this range or larger.
 Risks and challengesTransportation of Animals to the Pleistocene Park:We have prepared a logistical plan which will allow safe and comfortable trip for the animals. This is our 8th expedition to bring animals to Pleistocene Park. Some of these trips have been longer and more complicated and all have been successful.All animals in this trip will be transported in individual stalls. They will have enough space to stand up and lay down for rest. The design of the containers will allow animals to have access to enough fresh air, water and forage. The route and timing of the expedition will be planned to minimize time of animals spent in travel.Adaptation of Animals in the Pleistocene Park.In order to keep our crowdfunding budget reasonable we did not include any of the expenses for the adaptation of the animals in their first year in the Park. However I have already committed to invest my personal resources in proper animal care. This will include:- Full time salary for the ranger with veterinary education;- Transportation of forage to the Park to supply animals in the winter period;-- Construction of shelter/shelters to allow animals to adapt to the cold in the autumn/winter period.",13.0,1,"1 Campaign

</div><h4>Dear Friends,</h4>
<p>Do you believe
that aware and responsible children can help us change the world for the
better? Do you care about water as a precious but scarce resource? If you do
then please help Ecoloodi continue its mission to educate more children about water!</p>
<p><span>Ecoloodi </span>(<a href=""http://ecoloodi.org/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://ecoloodi.org/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ecoloodi.org</a>) is a bilingual non-profit organization working with children
to raise awareness about water and its responsible use. Two years ago, <span>after moving to Canada from France, </span>Ludiwine
Clouzot, also called “Loodi”, founded Ecoloodi. As a
water scientist, she has the knowledge, as an educator, the passion, and as a
creative person, many ideas. She is truly the “Water Woman”.</p>
<p>What started as
a one woman’s journey is now a focused expedition of a group of 20
passionate volunteers who empower children to take educated decisions now.</p>
<h2><b>What have we done so far?</b></h2>
<p>In the
last two years, Ecoloodi has reached over 12,000 children in Canada, 6,000
in Benin (French-speaking country in West Africa) and 500 in France.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456924486/jifsrwefuq4reradlfnw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Our
tools and services are designed to engage children aged 3-12 years through
play-based learning. Combining science, education and art, we have developed different
games, videos, workshops and
interactive shows. Our last creation is an illustrated and interactive book
based on an adorable video about the Water Cycle.</p>

Do you believe
that aware and responsible children can help us change the world for the
better? Do you care about water as a precious but scarce resource? If you do
then please help Ecoloodi continue its mission to educate more children about water!
Ecoloodi (ecoloodi.org) is a bilingual non-profit organization working with children
to raise awareness about water and its responsible use. Two years ago, after moving to Canada from France, Ludiwine
Clouzot, also called “Loodi”, founded Ecoloodi. As a
water scientist, she has the knowledge, as an educator, the passion, and as a
creative person, many ideas. She is truly the “Water Woman”.
What started as
a one woman’s journey is now a focused expedition of a group of 20
passionate volunteers who empower children to take educated decisions now.
What have we done so far?
In the
last two years, Ecoloodi has reached over 12,000 children in Canada, 6,000
in Benin (French-speaking country in West Africa) and 500 in France.Our
tools and services are designed to engage children aged 3-12 years through
play-based learning. Combining science, education and art, we have developed different
games, videos, workshops and
interactive shows. Our last creation is an illustrated and interactive book
based on an adorable video about the Water Cycle.
Watch our video – H2O: The Story of a
Little Drop

We have worked with great
organizations including Ryerson University, the Royal Ontario Museum, Engineers
Without Borders, the Public French School Board Viamonde, the Toronto Public

French Consulate in Toronto. We have also been extensively featured by media

– Possibly the most efficient irrigation system
in the world

In
a society where we are always busy, busy, busy, our gardens tend to fall a bit
short. This is a common problem and we have a simple solution.  Welcome to the new and
improved way to get the garden of your dreams with “EasiOyYa”.  We have developed a simple piece designed to make gardening
a breeze, and you may be wondering how.No more up turned plastic bottles, hosepipe bans or
relying on the neighbours or the rain while you’re away. No more thinking that the
idea of having a garden is too hard, time consuming and
sometimes not worth the hassle. We're out to change that, one EasiOyYa at a time! EasiOyYa makes home gardening easy.

EasiOyYa is a watering system that is based
on the Olla (pronounced Oy-Yah) which is a sub surface irrigation technique
thought to have originated in Northern Africa or ancient China over 4000 years
ago. Olla’s are traditionally unglazed
terracotta/clay pots that are buried almost fully into the earth and then having water poured into them, thereby using gravity to allow the water to flow in to
the surrounding earth to be absorbed by the plant roots.EasiOyYa has been adapted for today’s gardener from a highly effective
ancient method of sub surface irrigation, making the system even more efficient and easy to use – hence the
name EasiOyYa!

Before presenting EasiOyYa as a product for gardeners I carried out extensive research, and found the increase in gardening in all of its many guises created an even greater need for a product such as EasiOyYa than first imagined.In recent years there has been a dramatic
rise in the number of households in the US that are now turning to home
gardening as more than just a hobby, but a way of growing organic food for the
family and even to sell at local farmers markets.
Up to 1 in 3 households are now growing food - the highest overall participation and spending levels seen in a decade.
EasiOyYa is a flexible below surface
irrigation system that works for a variety of gardening scenarios. Whether you
are an urban home gardener with a series of pots, a few raised beds or the
proud owner of a large allotment, EasiOyYa will provide an excellent watering
system for your crops and plants.EasiOyYa is suitable for the following types
of gardens:

Gardens including
raised beds and planters

Herb and vegetable gardens

Small and large allotments


Community gardens


Hydroponic gardens


Small farms


Green house plants


Balcony or patio gardens


High rise apartments




When you purchase EasiOyYa you receive the
following components in your kit:
8 EasiOyYa’s – the clay, unglazed olla watering spikes
10 meters of tubing 
Fittings to connect to most tanks/water barrels/reservoirs.
We need to
make it clear that you will need to source your own tank/water barrel/reservoir
locally, due to shipping restraints - it is not part of the kit. 
Once you have your kit, simply decide on the pots or section of
garden you want to irrigate, and bury your EasiOyYa’s up to the lid, reasonably
spaced to allow planting in between. 
You will need to have a water tank, storage or barrel set up
for your water supply, then simply connect the 10-meter tubing to your reservoir
and attach to the top of each EasiOyYa. 
Once you have planted your plants or seedlings, simply fill
the reservoir and sit back and let the EasiOyYa’s do the work. 
Perfect for dry and arid climates, or for those long periods
away from home, EasiOyYa will water your plants constantly
and efficiently.
So now for the science bit… the EasiOyYa irrigation system works due to the micro porous (unglazed) walls of the clay pots that do not allow water to flow freely from the pot, but guides water seepage from it in the direction where capillary suction develops.To use EasiOyYa’s in the garden, simply
bury the EasiOyYa’s in the soil leaving just the top slightly protruding.    The EasiOyYa is constantly kept full of water via the
connecting tubing from the water tank or reservoir.

Once the EasiOyYa’s are positioned in the
soil and the crops planted adjacent to it, the EasiOyYa clay pot effects
sub-surface irrigation as water oozes out of it due to the suction force, which
attracts water molecules to the plant roots. 

The suction force is created by a
combination of the soil moisture tension and the plant roots pulling the
moisture themselves. It can actually be called a “Plant Controlled” watering
system.
This cut away section in my test tank shows how the plant roots eventually grow around the
pots and only “pull” moisture when needed, never wasting a single drop.  EasiOyYa’s virtually eliminate the runoff and
evaporation common in modern irrigation systems, allowing the plant to absorb
nearly 100 percent of the water, helping to look after your plants, preserve water and provide a sustainable gardening solution.      This is how simple food growing can be. You can follow the principles of square foot gardening, whether that be in a raised garden or pots like these. Plant around each EasiOyYa so many plants have access to the moisture and just connect to a water barrel.
The benefits of using EasiOyYa include:


Natural watering through terracotta – no
pumps or electricity required


Water delivered below ground, exactly where
the plants need it


Attractive, nearly invisible design – no
ugly upside down drink bottles


Plants have constant access to moisture –
less stress


Ordinary ollas need filling every few days
– EasiOyYa’s do it themselves


You can leave your plants for weeks
or months at a time without having to worry about the plants getting watered


EasiOyYa is simple and safe to
set up, everything you need (except for a reservoir) comes in the kit, just add water and let gravity do its thing!


The Features of EasiOyYa include:


A simple and effective design
that you can set up in almost the time it takes to make a cup of coffee!


Proven, effective sub surface
watering system


Everything you need in one kit
to start your very own naturally sustainable irrigation system, ready to connect
to your water source


Cost effective gravity feed
watering system that you can purchase at a special early bird cost when you
support the development and production of EasiOyYa through this crowdfunding
campaign



So far we have secured the trademarks and
patents needed to produce EasiOyYa, and we are now ready to go into full
production once we have the funds to cover tooling and the MOQ (Minimum Order
Quantity). We have recently had a small trial batch manufactured which will be made available to early backers of the EasiOyYa as soon as possible. 
The goal is to raise
A$23000 to cover these initial costs. 
Once the funds are in they will be distributed as follows:


$1100 for molds and samples


$2400 Quality assurance and inspections


$1000 Basic website and graphic design

$4500 Patents and Trademarks

$11500 Production of initial batch


$2500 Shipping for initial batch

Then we will be able to embark on a full production run to make EasiOyYa's available to gardeners everywhere.The Time Line






The story is simple and I'm not going to load this up with fluffy filler perks. The EasiOyYa kits only come in a single sized pack and this is how I will present them to you. There will be options to select multiple packs.

embraced but the U.S. has hardly considered is the usefulness of a 
3-wheeled vehicle.  While tricycles are in general use in cities across 
Europe, Asia and Central/South America, they are rarely seen here doing 
anything but keeping ice cream cold or transporting tourists around the 
block.<br/><br/><p>Introducing the Frankentrike, a human-powered, 
electric-assist all-purpose tricycle.  A Frankentrike makes for an ideal
 personal vehicle solution to meet most urban transport needs.  In the 
U.S. 73% of all vehicle trips are under 10 miles in distance.  This is a
 range within which this vehicle can often transport you door to door 
faster than on 2 or 4 wheels. </p><p>This opportunity comes at a pivotal
 time of rapid urbanization, climate instability and an epidemic of 
personal health crises.   With the Frankentrikes, you have an 
opportunity to switch to a clean ecological form of transport without 
sacrificing a lot of the benefits of owning a larger vehicle.  A 
Frankentrike gets over 900MPGe, making them 18x more energy-efficient 
than a Prius. This means that no matter how your electricity is being 
generated, your carbon imprint is infinitessimally small.  Being 
essentially an overgrown bicycle, you also have the option to PEDAL.  
This empowerment allows you to exercise<i> while </i>getting from one 
place to the next.  It also means you're never stuck.  No matter how low
 your 'fuel tank' is, you can always get to where you need to go.  It 
also means that in places where motorized vehicles are viewed poorly by 
others---like sidewalks and plazas-- you can move without motors and exhibit a 
gentler, quieter side to your rather large bicycle.</p><p>

<p>Driving this tricycle has completely removed my desire to ever own a 
car again.  What I've discovered, living in Vancouver, B.C., Seattle, WA
 and Oakland, CA, is that, now that I drive a Frankentrike, I no longer 
need to own a car.  Internet-based car sharing services and app-based 
taxi services meet all my larger vehicle needs while my bicycle in 
combination with trains, metros, and planes meets other needs.</p>
<p>Why
 add all this complexity to your life?  Two answers:  Enjoyment and 
savings.   I spend about 1/6 of what the average car owner spends on 
transportation yearly, <i>including</i> Frankentrike maintenance, vehicle rentals, taxi services and transit. <br/></p><p>
</p><p>And I have more fun.  I absolutely<b> love</b>
 being on a bicycle rather than being cooped up in a car.  I love to 
experience the fabric of the city that I live in and to not miss what's 
happening around me.  I love the wind in my hair, but I also love 
arriving to a party feeling fresh and energized, not smelly, exhausted, 
and drenched.  Most of all,<i> I love being seen </i>by the other large 
vehicles and being treated like a car by other cars.  I love being able 
to trigger the under-pavement sensors for the lights at intersections, 
and to open the gates of parking garages, which I'm never able to do on a
 bike.  I love <i>never </i>having to look for parking.  I love racing 
my friends to bars and parties. They are always astounded to discover 
that I've beaten them.  They don't factor in just how long it takes for 
them to walk to their parked car, wait to get onto the freeway, and to 
look for parking at their destination and then to walk from there to the
 front door.  Under 10 miles,  the Frankentrike is always in the running. </p>
<p> Even better, I love being able to travel with my friends as a pod, but 
to have them in front of me where I can see them and talk to them and 
still keep my eyes on the road.  I love driving kids around in this 
because for them, it feels like being at Disneyland on a ride.  I love 
being able to go <i>anywhere</i> that a bicycle can go.  I love being 
able to use the bike lanes and the sidewalks, but also not to be shunned
 from the car lanes.  It helps that i'm moving nearly as fast as the 
other motorized vehicles, so they are not bothered by the speed 
differential.  I think I've only ever been honked at once in the past 10
 years out of driver annoyance, yet dozens of times by people showing 
their support and appreciation for my choice of 'car.'   I love feeling 
the love from others too.  <br/></p><p><i>I hope that in the near future, that you will be able to share with me this experience. </i></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462755406/ftstory_vzvunt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462756006/cargotrikelogoadj_swsuzr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>Frankentrikes simply started as a personal search for an ideal personal city vehicle, but immediately after creating my own, people started to ask me if I could build one for them.  At first, flattered, I agreed. After 3 however, each of increasing complexity and for a higher price, I was feeling overworked, frail, and extremely burned out.  I realized that--even at the highest price--I wasn't asking for enough to meet my most basic needs, but at the same time, didn't want to ask more than people could afford.  I experimented with jig making and determined that the path forward to both financial sustainability and to maintaining a reasonable price was to stop doing custom builds and to go into manufacturing.<br/></p>I explored several funding options such as competing in the CleanTech Open, grants, loans, V.C.'s and Angel Investors, and concluded that NONE of them were a good fit for the project at this stage of development. <br/><br/>In 2010, I crashed along with the economy and took a long sabbatical from the project.  It was during this time that I first heard about the world of crowdfunding.<br/><br/>In 2012, I settled in the Bay Area, determined to attempt one last time to raise the seed capital that was needed to move towards final product development and manufacturing.<br/><br/>The goal of this fundraising effort is to make these vehicles available to all the people who still ask me at least once a week (and often more) if I can build them one.  The enterprise simply *must* make what it spends to be sustainable.  That includes the workers getting paid a fair wage (my friend and i calculated that he was making 1¢/hr helping with fabrication on the blue trike build).<br/><br/>Help us to go into manufacturing so that the vehicles can be available to your community for a reasonable price and so that everyone who helps to build them can be paid a fair wage. <br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459148117/ylhoiwg9gaubi1glagyi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

While they look and drive like large bicycles, in complexity they are
 really more like small cars.  For this reason, we want to iron out any 
potential weaknesses in the design <i>before</i> we go into 
manufacturing.  This will provide you with a safer more comfortable and 
more durable ride in the longterm.  After 15 years of research and 
development, the design for our first production model is 90% completed 
and only about 10% remains.<br/><br/><p>If our minimum funding goal is 
reached, we will spend the next two years from campaign close refining 
our product design so that by May of 2018, we have a complete 
production model ready for small batch manufacture and are ready to take
 orders.  The amount requested does not include the $1-2K that the 
founder invests (and continues to invest) in the project every month.  
Crowdfunding contributors who choose a Sponsor option
 will be the first to be invited to place an order.

<br/><h3><i><b>WHAT don't we know?</b></i></h3>
<p>We 
don't know the details of the frame construction, but the reality is 
that the production model won't look much different from what you see in
 the video in terms of form and function.  The only significant visual 
difference is that there will be no mesh and the production model won't 
be rusty ;)</p>
<p>We don't yet know if there will be suspension beyond 
what the suspension seat and fat tires offer.  We will add it if it does
 not compromise driver safety or frame longevity (and we have enough 
funding to engage in suspension design and testing). <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We have already built several working models and have figured out 
where to source nearly all of our components and principal accessories, 
so THIS isn't the challenge.  The biggest challenge is in sourcing the 
metal, because to-date, we've been repurposing bicycle frames. Well, 
this works for custom builds but not for manufacturing.  So this is our 
biggest unknown as far as materials costs.<br/></p>
<p>In addition, no one has ever tried to optimize the cargotrike 
archetype before for electric-assist.  We face the unique challenge of 
wanting to make the trike strong where it needs to be strong, and light 
where we can get away with it.  We're doing something that's never exactly been done before and are 
asking for the luxury of doing it right the first time and quickly, in 
service to the community and our world.</p>

I have unanswered questions specifically about the Frankentrike

<p>
</p>
<p>Many common questions that I've received over the years have been 
responded to in this <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/txlvlvv89xjk9o4/FT%20F.A.Q.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">F.A.Q. document</a> prepared for the Press. A window might pop-up, but you can make it go away by clicking 'no thanks, continue to view' at the bottom of the window.  If this document doesn't answer your question, feel free to drop me a line at segue@frankentrikes.com</p>

How much will they cost? <br/>How many things do you buy that are not manufactured? Not very many, right?  Well there's a reason for that.   Building things one at a time costs more than people want to pay, most of the time.  <br/><br/>Compare the cost of a custom-made bicycle with a manufactured bicycle.  It's 2-4x more expensive for the custom bicycle right?  Okay, now expand the complexity by about 10x and you have a Frankentrike.  <br/>   <br/>Now, even that custom bicycle you ordered is not totally 'hand built.' The creator is smartly using jigs to ensure correct alignment.  A bicycle fabricator can buy pre-made adjustable jigs.<br/><br/>As a builder of Frankentrikes, I can't just order jigs; I have to make them myself.  And if each tricycle is different, I can't make jigs that will work for every build. <br/><br/>I can't give you a price until our product development is complete, but I can tell you that your $5 to $1000+ contribution will enable me to make them for <b><i>at least $10,000 less per tricycle</i></b> than if I have to make them custom and one at a time.  So think of your donation as a small investment to the advancement of real-world technology that brings <i>huge </i>dividends in the near future. These vehicles are <i>so</i> much less expensive to own and operate per mile than a car that they will essentially pay for themselves in just a few years.  And just like Tesla, as we scale up, we will be able to bring the cost-per-tricycle down significantly.   </li>
<br/>Developing and releasing a product of this complexity is a process. You are contributing to a project for a good cause and that is to make cycling safer, more practical, more fun, and more accessible to more people. <br/><br/>
<li>Why are you building these?  Isn't X, Y, or Z already doing this?<br/><br/>Nobody else is doing a project like this in the world.  Take a closer look.   I challenge you to send me a link to something i haven't yet personally seen or experienced.  And I will point out the significant differences.   If I thought this need was already being met, I wouldn't be making this effort.  If I could just buy another vehicle that offers me anything even remotely close to what the Frankentrike offers, believe me, I would stop with all this extra work and just buy it!<br/><br/><br/>

What currently is the best option for personal urban transportation?  Despite the colorful array of emissions free electric vehicles on the market today, the fundamental limitations of travelling on four wheels or two have not yet been addressed.  Drivers still find that owning a car can be costly, sitting in traffic is stressful, and looking for parking can be time-consuming.  Cyclists have it easier in many ways, but have discovered that hauling loads can be tricky; they're exposed to the elements even when it's inconvenient; and safety is an ever-present concern.  For these reasons and many others, neither really optimally meets the everyday needs of city dwellers.What the world has long 
embraced but the U.S. has hardly considered is the usefulness of a 
3-wheeled vehicle.  While tricycles are in general use in cities across 
Europe, Asia and Central/South America, they are rarely seen here doing 
anything but keeping ice cream cold or transporting tourists around the 
block.Introducing the Frankentrike, a human-powered, 
electric-assist all-purpose tricycle.  A Frankentrike makes for an ideal
 personal vehicle solution to meet most urban transport needs.  In the 
U.S. 73% of all vehicle trips are under 10 miles in distance.  This is a
 range within which this vehicle can often transport you door to door 
faster than on 2 or 4 wheels. This opportunity comes at a pivotal
 time of rapid urbanization, climate instability and an epidemic of 
personal health crises.   With the Frankentrikes, you have an 
opportunity to switch to a clean ecological form of transport without 
sacrificing a lot of the benefits of owning a larger vehicle.  A 
Frankentrike gets over 900MPGe, making them 18x more energy-efficient 
than a Prius. This means that no matter how your electricity is being 
generated, your carbon imprint is infinitessimally small.  Being 
essentially an overgrown bicycle, you also have the option to PEDAL.  
This empowerment allows you to exercise while getting from one 
place to the next.  It also means you're never stuck.  No matter how low
 your 'fuel tank' is, you can always get to where you need to go.  It 
also means that in places where motorized vehicles are viewed poorly by 
others---like sidewalks and plazas-- you can move without motors and exhibit a 
gentler, quieter side to your rather large bicycle.


Driving this tricycle has completely removed my desire to ever own a 
car again.  What I've discovered, living in Vancouver, B.C., Seattle, WA
 and Oakland, CA, is that, now that I drive a Frankentrike, I no longer 
need to own a car.  Internet-based car sharing services and app-based 
taxi services meet all my larger vehicle needs while my bicycle in 
combination with trains, metros, and planes meets other needs.
Why
 add all this complexity to your life?  Two answers:  Enjoyment and 
savings.   I spend about 1/6 of what the average car owner spends on 
transportation yearly, including Frankentrike maintenance, vehicle rentals, taxi services and transit. 
And I have more fun.  I absolutely love
 being on a bicycle rather than being cooped up in a car.  I love to 
experience the fabric of the city that I live in and to not miss what's 
happening around me.  I love the wind in my hair, but I also love 
arriving to a party feeling fresh and energized, not smelly, exhausted, 
and drenched.  Most of all, I love being seen by the other large 
vehicles and being treated like a car by other cars.  I love being able 
to trigger the under-pavement sensors for the lights at intersections, 
and to open the gates of parking garages, which I'm never able to do on a
 bike.  I love never having to look for parking.  I love racing 
my friends to bars and parties. They are always astounded to discover 
that I've beaten them.  They don't factor in just how long it takes for 
them to walk to their parked car, wait to get onto the freeway, and to 
look for parking at their destination and then to walk from there to the
 front door.  Under 10 miles,  the Frankentrike is always in the running. 
 Even better, I love being able to travel with my friends as a pod, but 
to have them in front of me where I can see them and talk to them and 
still keep my eyes on the road.  I love driving kids around in this 
because for them, it feels like being at Disneyland on a ride.  I love 
being able to go anywhere that a bicycle can go.  I love being 
able to use the bike lanes and the sidewalks, but also not to be shunned
 from the car lanes.  It helps that i'm moving nearly as fast as the 
other motorized vehicles, so they are not bothered by the speed 
differential.  I think I've only ever been honked at once in the past 10
 years out of driver annoyance, yet dozens of times by people showing 
their support and appreciation for my choice of 'car.'   I love feeling 
the love from others too.  I hope that in the near future, that you will be able to share with me this experience. Frankentrikes simply started as a personal search for an ideal personal city vehicle, but immediately after creating my own, people started to ask me if I could build one for them.  At first, flattered, I agreed. After 3 however, each of increasing complexity and for a higher price, I was feeling overworked, frail, and extremely burned out.  I realized that--even at the highest price--I wasn't asking for enough to meet my most basic needs, but at the same time, didn't want to ask more than people could afford.  I experimented with jig making and determined that the path forward to both financial sustainability and to maintaining a reasonable price was to stop doing custom builds and to go into manufacturing.I explored several funding options such as competing in the CleanTech Open, grants, loans, V.C.'s and Angel Investors, and concluded that NONE of them were a good fit for the project at this stage of development. In 2010, I crashed along with the economy and took a long sabbatical from the project.  It was during this time that I first heard about the world of crowdfunding.In 2012, I settled in the Bay Area, determined to attempt one last time to raise the seed capital that was needed to move towards final product development and manufacturing.The goal of this fundraising effort is to make these vehicles available to all the people who still ask me at least once a week (and often more) if I can build them one.  The enterprise simply *must* make what it spends to be sustainable.  That includes the workers getting paid a fair wage (my friend and i calculated that he was making 1¢/hr helping with fabrication on the blue trike build).Help us to go into manufacturing so that the vehicles can be available to your community for a reasonable price and so that everyone who helps to build them can be paid a fair wage. 

While they look and drive like large bicycles, in complexity they are
 really more like small cars.  For this reason, we want to iron out any 
potential weaknesses in the design before we go into 
manufacturing.  This will provide you with a safer more comfortable and 
more durable ride in the longterm.  After 15 years of research and 
development, the design for our first production model is 90% completed 
and only about 10% remains.If our minimum funding goal is 
reached, we will spend the next two years from campaign close refining 
our product design so that by May of 2018, we have a complete 
production model ready for small batch manufacture and are ready to take
 orders.  The amount requested does not include the $1-2K that the 
founder invests (and continues to invest) in the project every month.  
Crowdfunding contributors who choose a Sponsor option
 will be the first to be invited to place an order. 
More info here
June–July 2016 Lease working space and set up existing tools and equipment.
August 2016–May 2018   How we spend this time will depend upon how much 
support we receive, but our highest priorities are listed above in 
Campaign Goals.
June–August 2018...  Manufacture and deliver 
Pioneer Batch One, then continue to the next Batch and manufacturing 
round, and so on.

This is not a final list, because the vehicle is still in-development.  However, most
 features and specifications are determined at this point because we've 
already discovered most of what works best for everyday use and have 
established relationships with our suppliers.

The size and proportions will be akin to the red tricycle and the look will be more akin to the blue tricycle.  Meaning that sidewall mesh is no longer available.

WHAT don't we know?
We 
don't know the details of the frame construction, but the reality is 
that the production model won't look much different from what you see in
 the video in terms of form and function.  The only significant visual 
difference is that there will be no mesh and the production model won't 
be rusty ;)
We don't yet know if there will be suspension beyond 
what the suspension seat and fat tires offer.  We will add it if it does
 not compromise driver safety or frame longevity (and we have enough 
funding to engage in suspension design and testing). 


Risks and challenges
We have already built several working models and have figured out 
where to source nearly all of our components and principal accessories, 
so THIS isn't the challenge.  The biggest challenge is in sourcing the 
metal, because to-date, we've been repurposing bicycle frames. Well, 
this works for custom builds but not for manufacturing.  So this is our 
biggest unknown as far as materials costs.
In addition, no one has ever tried to optimize the cargotrike 
archetype before for electric-assist.  We face the unique challenge of 
wanting to make the trike strong where it needs to be strong, and light 
where we can get away with it.  We're doing something that's never exactly been done before and are 
asking for the luxury of doing it right the first time and quickly, in 
service to the community and our world.

</ul></div>","The Challenge:Is to protect Ka'kabish, an ancient Maya city in Belize, from agricultural development that would see the site stripped of trees and the ancient temples and buildings leveled by bulldozers. The land is currently registered as agricultural and most of the land around the site has been cleared for farming. Pressure is mounting for this site to demolished in the same way. We are working with the Institute of Archaeology, a division of the National Institute of Culture and History, in Belize, to buy back this section of land and stop the impending destruction.We are working against a looming deadline and must raise the money by May 2017 to prevent this from happening to Ka’kabish. What is Ka'kabish?Ka’kabish, was a thriving ancient Maya city, located at the edge of the Maya world. From its inception in the 9th century BC until its demise in the 15th century AD, Ka’kabish exhibited an amazing resilience. It not only survived the turmoil at the start of the Classic period (AD 250) that saw the death of many other cities, it also survived the chaos at the end of that period (AD 900) which brought about the end of all but a few cities and heralded the demise of Classic Maya civilisation.Why it matters:Once upon a time . . . all of this section of north-central Belize was covered by dense jungle forest and you could drive all the way from the ruins of Lamanai to Ka’Kabish and beyond seeing nothing but jungle and glimpses of the wild-life.  Today, this is not the case and every year more and more parcels of land are cleared for agricultural development leaving little in the way of forest cover and animal habitat.  The rapacious nature of the development now threatens to destroy the 3,000-year old ancient city of Ka’Kabish. Urgency:As land in this area can only be farmed for 2-4 years before the soil is exhausted, there is increasing demand clear the few remaining pockets of jungle. Consequently, every year, more and more land is stripped, destroying smaller ruins and forcing wild-life to take refuge in what little jungle remains around Ka’kabish.  If we don’t act soon Ka’kabish will be destroying the same way. How we want to help:We want to finish the work we started and complete the purchase of Ka’kabish and make it a National Park. Working with the Institute of Archaeology, NICH, we will incorporate the site into the National Archaeological Reserve system of Belize. This will afford the site protection in perpetuity from clearing and development.  As part of the Archaeological Reserve system Ka’kabish will be accessible to the people of Belize and tourists who want to learn about ancient Maya culture.  Through continued archaeological work at the site and engagement with the surrounding communities we will promote a better understand of the value of cultural heritage to make future rescue efforts like this one unnecessary. The ask of you:We need your help to raise the remaining $30,000 CND to complete the purchase. What your contribution will fund:All of your money will go directly towards the purchase of the site.  The perks that you received are supplied by KARP and paid for by Dr. Haines as part of her commitment to preserving the site.  Funds raised above the currently needed amount will be used to purchase additional lands to the north of the site on which additional courtyard complexes are located and are still under forest coverage.Please note, that this campaign is not tax-deductible in Canada.   Who are we?KARP is an international team of researchers and students who work with our Belizean colleagues and members of the Indian Church Village to not only investigate the history of the 3,000-year old ancient city of Ka’kabish but also strive to educate others about the ancient Maya and to protect the local heritage for future generations.Meet the KARP Fundraising TeamWhat have we done so far?We surveyed the forest area covering Ka’kabish which has allowed the ruins to be excised from the larger parcel of agriculturally-zoned land on which it sits.

<h3>Chico Flax</h3>
<p>Hello, I am Sandy Fisher. I have been a professional weaver for over 30 years in my beautiful hometown of Chico, California. I am also a social entrepreneur, gardener, and environmentalist.</p>
<p>Like any entrepreneur, I think I have a problem worth solving. With my company, CHICO FLAX, my dream is to turn flax into linen!</p>
<p>One day, about five years ago, I looked into a friend’s garden and saw this beautiful blue-violet flax plant. Knowing that linen comes from flax, I wondered, “Can I grow flax to produce a fiber that grows clean, adds no pollutant, and the finished fabric breathes better than cotton. I also wondered, “Is there a way to work together with local farmers to provide the most basic human necessity—our clothes—to change the textile industry as we know it today?” Since then, my husband, Durl, and I have answered the first question. YES. We can grow flax in a sustainable manner. We’ve experimented with different varieties, soil types, and planting times, and guess what: IT CAN BE DONE! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why is Chico Flax a good Investment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flax hasn’t been grown, for linen, in the United States since early in the 20th century. </li>
<li>We have proven that it grows well as a winter crop in Northern California.  </li>
<li>We have been processing our flax by hand, by taking the steps to mechanize the processing of flax into linen yarns, we will have a saleable product. </li>
<li>There is a big demand from artisans and designers for locally scoured linen yarns.</li>
<li>We have partnered with California State University, Chico to determine which varieties of flax are best suited for Northern California soil and climate.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for us to reach our goal, we need $50,000. All of the yarns used in our gifts except for the tablerunner and hand made paper bowl are from highest quality linen from Belgium, the only source I have at the present time.</p>

<p>What could be more simple and straight forward than a natural burial? Having a ceremony that invites family participation, has little carbon footprint and also conserves nature?</p>
<p>Yet this isn’t an option in Connecticut or in most of New England.</p>
<p>For years I have been aware of the green burial movement and found it the most personally comforting idea of death that I had ever had. Knowing for certain that I wanted to be buried this way, I began looking for options in Connecticut.</p>
<p>When I couldn’t find a natural burial ground in the State (or even New England at the time!) I called the Green Burial Council. I asked if there were any prospective green burial grounds on the horizon. Kate Kalanick, the Executive Director, greeted me with utter enthusiasm. Just the previous week she had helped a terminally ill woman from Connecticut make plans to have her body transported to another State—another State!—to fulfill her vision of a natural burial.</p>
<p>It was then I knew I needed to do it. Because, as the adage goes, “If not me, who? If not now, when?”</p>
<p>So I gathered a small group of like-minded individuals and we began to research and plan. Over the past year, we have spoken with Land Trusts, Conservation Committees, individual land owners, Green Cemetery directors from other states and funeral homes. We have participated in events such as Earth Day and the Connecticut Land Conservation Conference. We wrote opinion pieces for three newspapers, identifying the need for a green cemetery. I even resigned from my career as an ER nurse so I could devote myself to this pursuit entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Our dream:</strong> a cemetery exclusively for organic burials—no embalming, no steel or concrete vault, no coffin unless of local, natural, unpainted wood, perhaps just a shroud of natural material. Over each grave, we plant a tree of native species designated by the deceased or a loved one. People become trees, and the cemetery becomes a forest preserved in perpetuity. </p>
<p>The biggest obstacle we face is educating the public on this option and thereby making it accessible to everyone. Our comprehensive business plan shows that there is a need for this service and an increasing level of environmental awareness across every demographic. But there is a vacuum in the Northeast in terms of eco-conscious burial options.</p>
<p>The time has come. <strong>We are ready.</strong> <u><i>Now we need help to buy land and cover start-up costs</i>.</u> Your donation, of any amount, will go towards those goals. We have established a not-for-profit organization, CGBG Foundation, Inc., and are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, so your contribution is 100% tax deductible.</p>
<p>It’s time to make green burial possible.<strong><i> We can do it</i></strong>.<strong> With your help, we can do it.</strong></p>

<strong>Paloma</strong>: Desde pequeña soñaba con recorrer la selva grabando documentales (también quería ser panadera…!). Dividida entre mis dos pasiones, enamorada de la cocina y defensora de la naturaleza. Estoy convencida que el equilibrio es posible y según dicen soy bastante cabezota. </li>
<li>
<strong>Joseba</strong>: Lleva el emprendimiento en las venas y la naturaleza en el corazón. Hortelano aficionado, le encanta recoger tomates con su sombrero de paja. Amante del surf y de la música. Su secreto para ser feliz: sonreír siempre y nunca dejar de soñar. </li>
<li>
<strong>Mina (nuestro skoolie)</strong>: Escogimos para nuestro 'skoolie' bus un nombre que nos recordara cómo empezó todo. Mina es un Orangután hembra que vive en la reserva de Bukit Lawang, Sumatra. Mina es conocida por todos por su 'carácter', no le gustan los selfies y mucho menos las plantaciones de aceite de palma... Pues eso, como anillo al dedo :)</li>

<h3>Nuestra Historia</h3>
<p>Después de nuestro visita a Indonesia, volvimos a casa traumatizados ante la contaminación por plástico. Queríamos expulsar el plástico de nuestras vidas y REDUCIR los residuos cambiando hábitos sencillos de nuestra vida cotidiana. Pero el aprendizaje fue lento y confuso!</p>
<p>Cuando empezamos este viaje hacia una vida más sostenible teníamos millones de dudas, nos equivocamos y nos encontramos con muchas dificultades… Y lo que nos queda por aprender todavía! Por ello queremos compartir todo nuestro aprendizaje contigo. </p>
<div>
<p>Decidimos hacer este viaje por la Costa Oeste como un reto, una forma de demostrar a todos y a nosotros mismos que es posible vivir con menos, de una manera mas sencilla y generando menos residuos. En el camino pasaremos por momentos difíciles, encontraremos obstáculos… y plástico, mucho plástico. Pero también encontraremos soluciones y recompensas!</p>
<p>Queremos limpiar tantas playas como podamos, pero nuestro objetivo es descubrir el secreto para vivir en equilibrio con la naturaleza y compartirlo con el mundo. </p>

<h3>Retos y Riesgos</h3>
<p>Pase lo que pase, tendréis vuestras camisetas y bolsas Choose The Planet! Pero como siempre, quien no arriesga no gana, y en este proyecto existe un riesgo. Si no alcanzamos la cifra de aportaciones necesarias, es posible que…</p>
<ul>
<li>No podamos producir el documental. </li>
<li>Es probable que limpiemos muchas menos playas o que no podamos acoger a tanta  gente en nuestros eventos y cleanups. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pero una cosa está asegurada… <strong>No vamos a tirar la toalla! </strong>Seguiremos compartiendo con vosotros todo lo que aprendamos sobre ‘zero waste’ y las soluciones que vayamos encontrando en nuestro viaje. LLámanos <i>hippies-yippies</i>! Pero hemos puesto muchísima ilusión en este proyecto y AMAMOS este planeta. Tenemos la esperanza de que juntos, con pequeños cambios, podemos mejorar la salud de nuestros oceános y salvar a nuestra Madre Tierra. </p>

<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Every drop in the ocean counts. Your help is important to us and to the planet because… </p>
<ul>
<li>From Canada to Costa Rica there is more than 8000 km of coastline… that means a lot of beaches to clean! We would like to clean as much as possible and meet thousands of people along the west coast, working together, and sharing our story :)</li>
<li>With the #plasticfreeoceans collection, we are donating 10% of profits from the sale of all products within this range to worldwide initiatives and organizations that are fighting against plastic pollution and doing their best to protect the environment and the marine wildlife. Also, we will support projects that are researching for a better use to plastic than becomes poison for our oceans!</li>
<li>Imagine how could be to change the shopping habits and lifestyle of thousands of people, just switching from a plastic toothbrush to a bamboo alternative… that could avoid a few tons of plastic waste going to the landfill every year! And that’s only an example.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who are we? </h3>
<p>We a two people (both stubborn) with the same mission: to change the lifestyle of millions of people to save the world! </p>
<p><strong>Paloma</strong>: Dreaming of filming nature documentaries from a young age, conscious about the environment and baker at heart. Divided between my two passions I’m convinced that it’s possible to find the balance… people say that I’m very stubborn. </p>
<p><strong>Joseba</strong>: Young entrepreneur. Nature is in his heart. Gardening enthusiast who enjoys growing tomatoes in his backyard. Music and surfing are his passions. His secret for happiness is always smiling and never stop dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>Mina</strong> (our skoolie): We had to choose a name for our skoolie that reminded us of the beginning of this story. Mina is a rehabilitated orangutan who lives in the Indonesian rainforest of Gunung Leuser National Park, Sumatra. Mina is well known for her ‘bad temper’, she doesn’t like selfies with tourists and she hates palm oil plantations… we thought it fitted like a glove. </p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>After our trip to Indonesia, we became aware of the plastic pollution problem. Rubbish was dumped into rivers or burnt in piles. We were shocked. </p>
<p>Back in London, we decided to get plastic out of our lives too… but it wasn’t an easy job! We changed our shopping habits, cooked everything from scratch and tried to reduce waste as much as possible.</p>
<p>It was a long and confusing process. When we started our transition, we had millions of questions and doubts. We made a lot of mistakes (and we still make them). There is still a lot to learn on this journey, and we want to share it with you. </p>
<p>We accepted this trip as a challenge. Starting from scratch, living simpler and enjoying more. </p>
<p>Our goal is to learn how to live without generating trash, avoiding recycling. We know we will find a lot of troubles… and plastic. But we will also find solutions and rewards!</p>
<p>We want to clean beaches but our mission is to find the secret of living in balance with our nature and sharing it with everyone. Finding the balance with our choices. Choosing better for the planet.</p>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Challenges and risks</h3>
<p>No matter what happens, you will have your perk (t-shirt or bag) #plasticfreeocean :) Unfortunately, who does not risk does not win, and we have a risk too. If we don’t get enough funds, we might not be able to…</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the documentary. </li>
<li>Organize the number of beach cleanups we wish, and fewer people will join us because either they didn’t hear about us or we are not able to host them. </li>
</ul>
<p>But one thing is guaranteed… we are not going to give up! We will keep sharing with you our trip and transition to a zero-waste living and will tell you everything we learn on this journey. </p>

Nuestro planeta necesita necesita un cambio, y creemos que la mejor manera de conseguirlo es uniéndonos todos a un movimiento. CTP es un movimiento que muestra cómo con pequeños cambios en nuestro día a día podemos conseguir un GRAN impacto para ayudar a nuestro planeta. 
 

Te necesitamos
Necesitamos un empujoncito que nos ayude a:

Promocionar el proyecto, eventos y limpiezas de playas en redes sociales.
Financiar los materiales y el equipo necesario para la limpieza de playas.
Lanzar nuestra colección de bolsas y camisetas #plasticfreeoceans que estará disponible en nuestra tienda online, con la que además apoyaremos proyectos y organizaciones que luchan contra la contaminación por plástico. 
Financiar la post-producción del documental que estamos grabando desde el inicio de nuestro viaje.

¿Qué recibes a cambio?
A cambio de tu aportación podrás hacerte con una de nuestras camisetas y/o bolsas de la colección #plasticfreeoceans!
Camisetas CTP #plasticfreeoceans: Diseño único en acuarela están impresas en algodón 100% orgánico y tinta de base al agua, mucho más respetuosas con el medio ambiente y con tu piel!


 
Bolsas CTP #plasticfreeoceans: Diseño exclusivo en acuarela y mensaje muy molón. Algodón 100% orgánico y tinta de base al agua.

Tu Impacto 

¿Qué conseguirás con tu aportación?
Cada gota cuenta en el océano! Tu aportación es importante para nosotros y para el planeta porque…

Desde Canadá a Costa Rica hay más de 8000 km de costa, y eso son muchas playas! Queremos limpiar tantas playas como podamos y dejar reluciente la costa del Pacífico :)
Con la colección #plasticfreeoceans apoyaremos proyectos e iniciativas de gente brillante y comprometida que están luchando contra el plástico, dándole un mejor propósito que el de convertirse en veneno para nuestros peces!
Imagina cómo molaría si con tu ayuda cambiáramos los hábitos de miles de personas pasando de un cepillo de plástico a uno de bambú… Si cada persona utiliza de media unos cuatro cepillos de dientes al año... Evitaríamos toneladas de plástico al año!

Y eso es sólo un ejemplo.

Quiénes somos? 
Somos dos jóvenes cabezotas con una misión:  cambiar los hábitos de millones de personas y salvar este planeta! 



Paloma: Desde pequeña soñaba con recorrer la selva grabando documentales (también quería ser panadera…!). Dividida entre mis dos pasiones, enamorada de la cocina y defensora de la naturaleza. Estoy convencida que el equilibrio es posible y según dicen soy bastante cabezota. 

Joseba: Lleva el emprendimiento en las venas y la naturaleza en el corazón. Hortelano aficionado, le encanta recoger tomates con su sombrero de paja. Amante del surf y de la música. Su secreto para ser feliz: sonreír siempre y nunca dejar de soñar. 

Mina (nuestro skoolie): Escogimos para nuestro 'skoolie' bus un nombre que nos recordara cómo empezó todo. Mina es un Orangután hembra que vive en la reserva de Bukit Lawang, Sumatra. Mina es conocida por todos por su 'carácter', no le gustan los selfies y mucho menos las plantaciones de aceite de palma... Pues eso, como anillo al dedo :)


 
Nuestra Historia
Después de nuestro visita a Indonesia, volvimos a casa traumatizados ante la contaminación por plástico. Queríamos expulsar el plástico de nuestras vidas y REDUCIR los residuos cambiando hábitos sencillos de nuestra vida cotidiana. Pero el aprendizaje fue lento y confuso!
Cuando empezamos este viaje hacia una vida más sostenible teníamos millones de dudas, nos equivocamos y nos encontramos con muchas dificultades… Y lo que nos queda por aprender todavía! Por ello queremos compartir todo nuestro aprendizaje contigo. 

Decidimos hacer este viaje por la Costa Oeste como un reto, una forma de demostrar a todos y a nosotros mismos que es posible vivir con menos, de una manera mas sencilla y generando menos residuos. En el camino pasaremos por momentos difíciles, encontraremos obstáculos… y plástico, mucho plástico. Pero también encontraremos soluciones y recompensas!
Queremos limpiar tantas playas como podamos, pero nuestro objetivo es descubrir el secreto para vivir en equilibrio con la naturaleza y compartirlo con el mundo. 


 


Retos y Riesgos
Pase lo que pase, tendréis vuestras camisetas y bolsas Choose The Planet! Pero como siempre, quien no arriesga no gana, y en este proyecto existe un riesgo. Si no alcanzamos la cifra de aportaciones necesarias, es posible que…

No podamos producir el documental. 
Es probable que limpiemos muchas menos playas o que no podamos acoger a tanta  gente en nuestros eventos y cleanups. 

Pero una cosa está asegurada… No vamos a tirar la toalla! Seguiremos compartiendo con vosotros todo lo que aprendamos sobre ‘zero waste’ y las soluciones que vayamos encontrando en nuestro viaje. LLámanos hippies-yippies! Pero hemos puesto muchísima ilusión en este proyecto y AMAMOS este planeta. Tenemos la esperanza de que juntos, con pequeños cambios, podemos mejorar la salud de nuestros oceános y salvar a nuestra Madre Tierra.

<p>Ecuador has more than 25,000 different kinds of trees and plants; 4,500 of them exists only in this Country, 78% are threatened to some degree, 8% in critical danger of extinction. Approximately 90,000 hectares (222,000 acres, 900Km²) are deforested annually since 1990, that is more than 16% of all the forest in 28 years.</p>
<p>When someone cuts a tree, parasitic plants and epiphytes such as orchids and bromeliads; birds, plants, etc, also lose their space to develop. If we do not take immediate action, the whole ecosystem may change and many animals and plants species will disappear.</p>

<p>How?</p>
<p>A tree is not only a living being; it is home, food, medicine, support, etc. of many other species that really depend on it; A beneficial ecological synergy is generated for everyone, including us, humans.</p>
<p>But how will we show that pruning and gathering from forests is more productive and beneficial over time, than cutting trees and deforesting?</p>
<p>We promise that <strong>for every essential oil blend</strong> that you acquire in this campaign, <strong>we will plant a native tree in your name</strong>. Furthermore, we will teach the success of this project to local communities so that they learn that while collecting leaves and fruits, and pruning branches to produce handicrafts, essential oils and creams, nature can provide constant income in a sustainable way, as opposed to the current and ongoing deforestation to obtain wood for immediate economic returns, in detriment to the future benefits of their descendants, and of all of mankind eternally.</p>
<p>Your contribution will lead to a snowball-effect of change, because it will significantly improve the economic situation of the natives giving them a constant source of income by maintaining and improving their local ecosystem.</p>
<p>We are sure that with your help, we will achieve it; and in the near future, the environment and our descendants will thank us.</p>
<p>We will invest the money of this campaign in the following way:</p>

<p>Remember that 4% of the global species just exists in this tiny country located in the center of the earth, which receives more than 12 hours of sunshine every day; the center of the territory is crossed by the Andes mountain-range and receives direct winds from the Pacific and those from the Atlantic Oceans that have crossed the entire amazon jungle, these geographical conditions create a diverse and unique ecosystem.</p>
<p>In this blessed corner of the planet, the forests are dense, the soil rich in nutrients that make the vegetation grow strong and abundant. Researchers have studied the different species of the flora and have identified amazing therapeutic benefits. Some of these plants have been used in local traditional and ancestral medicine, and are already being extracted as raw materials to produce essential oils, so that their benefits can be enjoyed by everyone.</p>
<p>If we do nothing, deforestation will continue destroying the environment exponentially.</p>
<p>We need your support now! Together we can create a synergy that will improve and preserve - not only this corner of the Earth’s ecosystem, but that of entire world.</p>

When someone cuts a tree, parasitic plants and epiphytes such as orchids and bromeliads; birds, plants, etc, also lose their space to develop. If we do not take immediate action, the whole ecosystem may change and many animals and plants species will disappear.

Our Team Campaign´s Volunteers and I want to show that, pruning and gathering from the forest is more productive and beneficial over time, than cutting trees and deforesting.

How?
A tree is not only a living being; it is home, food, medicine, support, etc. of many other species that really depend on it; A beneficial ecological synergy is generated for everyone, including us, humans.
But how will we show that pruning and gathering from forests is more productive and beneficial over time, than cutting trees and deforesting?
We promise that for every essential oil blend that you acquire in this campaign, we will plant a native tree in your name. Furthermore, we will teach the success of this project to local communities so that they learn that while collecting leaves and fruits, and pruning branches to produce handicrafts, essential oils and creams, nature can provide constant income in a sustainable way, as opposed to the current and ongoing deforestation to obtain wood for immediate economic returns, in detriment to the future benefits of their descendants, and of all of mankind eternally.
Your contribution will lead to a snowball-effect of change, because it will significantly improve the economic situation of the natives giving them a constant source of income by maintaining and improving their local ecosystem.
We are sure that with your help, we will achieve it; and in the near future, the environment and our descendants will thank us.
We will invest the money of this campaign in the following way:

Remember that 4% of the global species just exists in this tiny country located in the center of the earth, which receives more than 12 hours of sunshine every day; the center of the territory is crossed by the Andes mountain-range and receives direct winds from the Pacific and those from the Atlantic Oceans that have crossed the entire amazon jungle, these geographical conditions create a diverse and unique ecosystem.
In this blessed corner of the planet, the forests are dense, the soil rich in nutrients that make the vegetation grow strong and abundant. Researchers have studied the different species of the flora and have identified amazing therapeutic benefits. Some of these plants have been used in local traditional and ancestral medicine, and are already being extracted as raw materials to produce essential oils, so that their benefits can be enjoyed by everyone.
If we do nothing, deforestation will continue destroying the environment exponentially.
We need your support now! Together we can create a synergy that will improve and preserve - not only this corner of the Earth’s ecosystem, but that of entire world.
Please spread our campaign with all your contacts, help us reach as many people through the Indiegogo share buttons.

<p>Anyone can purchase the mug, t-shirt or thank you photo regardless of whether they have donated or not.  That is accomplished by sending funds using Paypal to our paypal account paypal@wara.ca.  The amount to send is as follows: the mug is $15, the t-shirt is $30, the personalized thank-you framed photo is $50 and the onboard recognition plaque is $100.    If you just want the <b>perk without a tax receipt</b>, just go ahead and donate on Indiegogo and select your perk.   If you want <b>just the tax receipt </b>go ahead and donate on Indiegogo and select *no perk* - and enter your address .  If you want <b>both a tax receipt *and* a perk</b> then you have to make two independent transactions - first a donation on Indiegogo for the tax receipt and then second you have to purchase the item you want  via <a href=""http://www.paypal.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.paypal.ca</a> to paypal@wara.ca.  Voila!</p>

</div></div>","Our story.

Wellington Auxiliary Rescue Association (WARA - also known as ""Wellington Rescue"") is a non-profit volunteer-run search and rescue team based out of Prince Edward County's Wellington harbour.  We go out onto Lake Ontario to aid boaters in distress and we help them get safely back to shore.   Wellington Rescue is continuing the 125+ year-old tradition of operating a rescue boat serving boaters off the Southern and Western shores of ""The County"".
Wellington Rescue identified the need for a new boat a couple of years ago.  We have been saving funds towards the new boat for a few years and we just purchased her.  She has the ""right stuff"" to be a safer and more effective boat than our existing donated boat.
Now we need to refit her to search and rescue standards.  It is critically important that our search and rescue team members go out onto Lake Ontario with an appropriately prepared vessel and with the necessary equipment to safely and effectively rescue boaters.  Without your support to achieve this, the new boat will not  be able to be put in service.   What We Need We will use the donations to fund our new boat rebuild.  We have to strip her down to the metal and build her back up.  This includes completely repainting her, rewiring her, welding in some panels for storage lockers, installing a bow thruster, constructing a new helm station, refactoring the roof, installing the engine and transmission (which are out of the boat) and purchasing and installing up to date electronics and safety equipment.
What You Get
Depending on your donation, we will offer perks such as a Wellington Rescue mug, a t-shirt, a framed-photo, an on-board recognition plaque - or more!  Items purchased or received from Wellington rescue are available for pickup only - we don't offer shipping.  Note that pickup is at advertised times and only occurs infrequently.  We will communicate that by email once we acquire the items and they arrive.
We are a registered charity and can provide you with a tax receipt for donations $50 and up.  Unfortunately, we can only do this if you do not select a perk since donations in Canada are only tax deductible if you do not receive any material benefit personally.
Anyone can purchase the mug, t-shirt or thank you photo regardless of whether they have donated or not.  That is accomplished by sending funds using Paypal to our paypal account paypal@wara.ca.  The amount to send is as follows: the mug is $15, the t-shirt is $30, the personalized thank-you framed photo is $50 and the onboard recognition plaque is $100.    If you just want the perk without a tax receipt, just go ahead and donate on Indiegogo and select your perk.   If you want just the tax receipt go ahead and donate on Indiegogo and select *no perk* - and enter your address .  If you want both a tax receipt *and* a perk then you have to make two independent transactions - first a donation on Indiegogo for the tax receipt and then second you have to purchase the item you want  via www.paypal.ca to paypal@wara.ca.  Voila!
The Impact
 With your help, Wellington Rescue will have the new boat in the water sooner, which will allow us to go out in a wider range of situations.  That means we will be a safer and more effective unit sooner - with your financial help.
We have the expertise and proven track record of preparing and launching a search and rescue boat.  We have a team of people ready to do the work.  We just need your donation!

    Other Ways You Can Help If you are not in a position to contribute financially - there are still ways you can support the initiative - you can help us get the word out to those who can donate!  You can share our campaign on social media or verbally to your friends and family.  Also, if you are local to The County, you can come out to our work parties to help us prepare the boat.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</li> <li>Expert witnesses: We need to bring in the experts who can talk about things like how <a href=""http://puc.sd.gov/commission/dockets/HydrocarbonPipeline/2014/HP14-001/draexhibit3.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">badly pipelines have been built</a> and the <a href=""http://ens-newswire.com/2013/04/16/keystone-xl-pipeline-would-hasten-climate-change-report/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">impacts of Keystone XL on our climate</a>. Time and travel costs money, but having these experts on our side will make all the difference.<br/>
</li> <li>Grassroots activation: Big Oil has a lot of money for advertising and propaganda, but we have a lot of <b>people</b> who believe in a new energy future. Funds from this campaign will help on-the-ground organizers mobilize those people to take action and stand up to the companies who threaten our land.</li>

It will take all of us - Indigenous, non-native, young, old, farmers, ranchers, urban, rural - to shift away from fossil fuels. We are fighting for our collective future, and we're asking you to join us to fight together.

  What this campaign will help us fund:
  Legal fees: We're lucky to have lawyers from across the country helping us in front of our local governmental agencies, but there is only so much they can do pro bono. If we're going to fight and win against the deep pockets of the Oil Industry, we need to help our legal teams get the support they need!
 Expert witnesses: We need to bring in the experts who can talk about things like how badly pipelines have been built and the impacts of Keystone XL on our climate. Time and travel costs money, but having these experts on our side will make all the difference.
 Grassroots activation: Big Oil has a lot of money for advertising and propaganda, but we have a lot of people who believe in a new energy future. Funds from this campaign will help on-the-ground organizers mobilize those people to take action and stand up to the companies who threaten our land.



Proposed Dakota Access Pipeline route across South Dakota    The People: 
""I believe we have reached a 
critical point, as a community and nation, where we must decide either 
to continue our incessant hunger for petrochemicals or to alter our 
course. We can demand a much cleaner and sustainable energy future or 
continue to be trapped by our lust for fossil fuels and inability to 
change. I believe we have the desire and capacity to make the smart 
choice."" - Tony Helland, Sioux Falls, South Dakota
“Pte
Ospaye Spiritual Camp mission is stand in opposition to the Keystone XL
Pipeline and the social evils that come with Big Oil. It is ground zero for the Lakota people
fighting this pipeline as it would have to pass through this area first."" Joye Braun, Bridger, South Dakota
”Benzene, a potent carcinogen, has increasingly become the most 
threatening of all environmental toxins...allowing one of the largest 
pipelines filled with the world’s dirtiest oil, under the most extreme 
pressure to funnel benzene and other toxins into South Dakota is a major
 public health threat. The lifeblood of South Dakota, the Missouri River, which supplies water to over 50% of the state must be protected."" Cindy Meyers, Stuart, Nebraska

    Proposed Keystone XL route across South Dakota
  Our challenge:
 We face an uphill battle.
Keystone XL has been an on-going fight in South Dakota for well over seven years. And the company proposing Dakota Access is already shipping pipe into South Dakota - they assume they'll get their permit, no questions asked. 
We are in front of a political permitting body that's never denied a permit.
We are facing huge money and huge power in the Oil Industry.
But we are front and center in a global fight, and we are ready to take it to the next level. We wont stop fighting until Keystone XL and Dakota Access are denied in South Dakota. We wont stop until the Great Plains are protected, valued, and preserved for future generations!

Sea Shepherd's flagship, the MV Steve Irwin is currently docked here and getting repaired for the next ocean conservation campaign. Chatting with one of the captains the other day, I found out that the Steve is desperate to upgrade its marine satellite communication system. </p>
<p>Why desperate? Because the current system is terribly outdated and communication is a key success factor on every campaign let alone a safety factor whilst out at sea. The current system's satellite phone and internet connection is very slow and often drops out completely...a problem when you need to get the latest photos and video footage of an encounter with poachers out quickly or when international media stations want to contact you for live interviews. The Steve's main role in the Sea Shepherd fleet is communication (and housing the helicopter). </p>
<p>But apart from that the system is being used for secure communication and the tactical coordination between the Sea Shepherd ships (they are often not within radar range of each other to cover a wider area at sea and increase the chances to find poachers or the whaling fleet). The system is also being used for the latest weather updates (important in Antarctica where storms develop out of nowhere). But most importantly the system is used to contact the small boats when they are out and need to find their way back to the Steve before the weather changes or before they run out of fuel. </p>
<p>Now, marine communication systems aren't cheap and the Steve is struggling right now to fund its emergency communication station (the part that radios in help before you jump on a liferaft). So the ship's official fundraising campaign is currently focussing on getting that sorted. </p>
<p>However, the safety of the 40 or so crew onboard the Steve and the cause they are serving, protecting marine life for us and for future generations, is important to me. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So, I have decided to run a private crowdfunding campaign. You are my crowd! Not a big crowd I must admit, and the amount we need is not small but I like a challenge and I like to believe that I am surrounded by people that care about the future of our oceans as much as I do. </span></p>
<p>We have got some cool perks in exchange for your donations...including tickets to the amazing Wanderlust Yoga Festival! You can find more details below but let me thank you at this stage for reading this, for sharing this with people you think may be interested in contributing, and of course for your donation!!</p>

<h3>Here is the plan: </h3>
<p>Fleet Broadband is not cheap...in fact, it will cost a whopping AUD 15,000, ouch! But operating it will only cost half of what the old system costs. So it's a good deal in the long run.  </p>
<p>Here is what I'm thinking...I did the same on a smaller scale 2 years ago (as some of you will remember) to raise funds for emergency equipment on another Sea Shepherd ship. With your help we can hopefully pull this one off as well. </p>
<p>I will match what gets raised here up to AUD 1,000 and my employer will make an additional 4-digit contribution. I set the goal on this page to 5K so we have an achievable amount to raise. Fingers crossed though (and thumbs pressed, German style) that we can raise a 5-digit amount. The crew of the Steve will try to raise the remainder. </p>
<p>Now, what's in it for you if you contribute to this fundraiser, apart from good ocean karma? Well, take a look at the perks listed on the side that the crew has put together. </p>
<p>Also, the wonderful crew at Wanderlust have generoulsy donated 2 free tickets for their next 4-day Yoga Festival at Thredbo (Australia, 18 - 21 Feb 2016). I have been to their last festival and can tell you that it's sheer amazing so if I were you I would grab those tickets asap! They are currently selling for AUD 460 each and you can get them for just AUD 350, good ocean karma and all included! Check out the perks.</p>

<p>What else...I don't want anything for my birthday this month. Really, not even those little sweet sneaky presents on top of donations. Rather donate more please because the best present for me will be seeing that comms system getting installed on the ship! :)</p>
<p>I will keep you in the loop in terms of how much we ended up raising and let you know when the crew purchased and installed the new comms system.</p>
<p>And what, if we raise more than what we need, even the whole 15,000...wow, imagine! In that case I will post an update what additional items can be bought. Apart from that, the cost of fuel for the ship is about AUD 5,000 per day. Operation Icefish (more details further down) lasted for 110 days...</p>

<h3>About the ship and the crew</h3> <p>The MV Steve Irwin is a 40 years old Scot, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">59.5 m (195 ft) long, and was purchased by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in 2005. To date it has </span>mainly been used to protect<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary against illegal whaling operations but also on campaign against the overfishing of tuna in the </span>mediterranean<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and to help maintain the integrity of the humpback whale nursery around Australia's Kimberley. </span></p>
<p>In 2007, the ship was named the MV Steve Irwin in honour of the late animal and environmental conservationist who was planning to join Sea Shepherd on a whale defence campaign in Antarctica shortly before his death. Now Steve is on every campaign. </p>
<p>During campaign the ship holds about 40 people (it's tight on the ship then) that are dedicated to the engine, deck, bridge, galley or media department. Right now, about 25 volunteers work on the ship to get it ready for campaign. </p>
<p>Sea Shepherd runs 100% on donations, be it money, time, skills or items in-kind. Knowing the organisation up close for a while now, I can say that everything is done on a shoestring, everything, and it's truly amazing what can be achieved with relatively little money and pure dedication!<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444223329/lwv32boieeawr0jankrd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Right now, the crew is working 6 days a week from 8am to 6pm to fix the engine, sort out the comms system, prepare the small boats, get rid of the constant rust, and repair other bits and pieces that constantly break down on an old ship. Everyone is an unpaid volunteer. All they get is 3 meals a day (that's what we get the food donations for), a t-shirt &amp; hoody that says ""crew"", and the before mentioned good ocean karma. </p>
<p>I guess I should also mention that even though no one got ever hurt, every campaign comes with its dangers and the crew members know that they are risking their lives each time they are out at sea. A reliable satellite comms system will keep the crew a fair bit safer. </p>
<p>Here are a couple more pictures showing the crew fighting rust on the Steve and the  Southern Ocean Base when the 3 big ships are in port (the Steve is the first ship on the right). </p>

<p>The Steve has spearheaded 7 of Sea Shepherd's 10 Antarctic whale defence campaigns, taking a key role in saving over 5,000 whales targeted for slaughter. </p>
<p>Last year, Sea Shepherd undertook its first campaign against illegal toothfish poaching in Antarctica. This operation used innovative direct action tactics to fill a law enforcement void exploited by illegal toothfish operators. Two weeks into the operation the Sea Shepherd vessel Bob Barker found one of the most infamous toothfish vessels in history, the Thunder. For a record 110 days the Bob pursued this illegal vessel. Eventually the poachers scuttled their own ship to avoid INTERPOL finding evidence of their illegal activity. Luckily no-one was injured. The crew from the Thunder were rescued by Sea Shepherd and then handed over to local authorities. Sea Shepherd also handed over evidence of the poaching activities. Only recently, t<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">he Supreme Court of São Tomé and Príncipe has found three officers of the Thunder guilty. They have been sentenced to between 32 and 36 months in jail each for recklessness and forgery, and have been fined EUR 15 million for charges relating to pollution and damage to the environment. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444230819/auysoiyq9t6nvmzfguxw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>While the Bob pursued the Thunder, the Sea Shepherd vessel Sam Simon spent days and nights for weeks retrieving the fishing gear the Thunder had abandoned. The illegal gillnets were left trawling the ocean floor and would have ghost fished for a very long time. The Sam's crew reeled in 72 kilometres of those gillnets. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444230794/ggb1f7w9yq86k39jbymr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A lot of awareness was generated around the illegal tooth fish operations. Whilst the Thunder is gone for good, the other 5 vessels of the poaching fleet were subsequently held in various ports in Asia where the authorities are investigating. Unfortunately one of them escaped Thailand a couple of weeks ago and is likely to continue its illegal fishing activities this Antarctic summer. Even more of a reason to quickly get the Steve ready!</p>
<p>The Japanese whaling fleet is returning to Antarctica in December to continue ""the harvest"" as they call it. Here is a video that summarises Sea Shepherd's anti-whaling campaign in Antarctica to date but also gives glimpses of the other campaigns around the world. Sea Shepherd is active on every continent to protect whales, dolphins, seals, sharks, turtles, toothfish, tuna, sea urchins, reef fish, krill and other ocean inhabitants from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. There are even sea bird campaigns! :)</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FsoxlqX5U2iQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DsoxlqX5U2iQ&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FsoxlqX5U2iQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>

While the Bob pursued the Thunder, the Sea Shepherd vessel Sam Simon spent days and nights for weeks retrieving the fishing gear the Thunder had abandoned. The illegal gillnets were left trawling the ocean floor and would have ghost fished for a very long time. The Sam's crew reeled in 72 kilometres of those gillnets. 


A lot of awareness was generated around the illegal tooth fish operations. Whilst the Thunder is gone for good, the other 5 vessels of the poaching fleet were subsequently held in various ports in Asia where the authorities are investigating. Unfortunately one of them escaped Thailand a couple of weeks ago and is likely to continue its illegal fishing activities this Antarctic summer. Even more of a reason to quickly get the Steve ready!
The Japanese whaling fleet is returning to Antarctica in December to continue ""the harvest"" as they call it. Here is a video that summarises Sea Shepherd's anti-whaling campaign in Antarctica to date but also gives glimpses of the other campaigns around the world. Sea Shepherd is active on every continent to protect whales, dolphins, seals, sharks, turtles, toothfish, tuna, sea urchins, reef fish, krill and other ocean inhabitants from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. There are even sea bird campaigns! :)

We focus on protecting the Bornean orangutan population living in and around one of Indonesian Borneo's most magnificent protected areas, Gunung Palung National Park, located in West Kalimantan. Our conservation program has been around for 15 years, and we're well-known and trusted in the local community.</p>
<p>In 2009, we purchased a small piece of land in the National Park buffer zone, in a village called Pampang Harapan, and built our Bentangor Environmental Education Center. This is a community gathering and educational space, where we work to raise awareness and knowledge about orangutans and their rainforest habitat. We're proud to say that Bentangor is the only center of it's kind in this area of West Kalimantan! We maintain the center buildings themselves as well as a piece of forest (about 500 square meters) behind the center, which we use as a field trip area for elementary school students. Unfortunately, two months ago we were disappointed to discover that someone had cleared the land directly adjacent to ours, haphazardly chopping down and burning the trees, which has negatively affected our land as well. Now we've been informed that this land is for sale - and we want to purchase it. <br/></p>
<p>Buying this land will serve two purposes: first, it will allow us to protect the small bit of forest that remains, and prevent further damage to Bentangor's facilities. Secondly, it will give us more area that can be used for educational activities! This will be a great space to show school groups the reality of forest destruction, and we hope to develop it into a natural laboratory for local students, especially our own volunteer youth group, to observe natural ecosystem regeneration and get hands-on experience with agro-forestry and forest restoration. Your donation can help us turn these hopes and dreams into action, while contributing to the long-term conservation of Bornean orangutans in the Gunung Palung landscape! <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are aiming to raise $5,000 for this project. We need:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$2,500 to purchase the land itself, at a cost of approximately $8/square meter</li>
<li>$1,000
 to build some new structures once we've obtained the land, including a 
gazebo gathering space, seedling nursery, and educational signboards </li>
<li>$1,500 to cover logistical and staff costs for the 4-5 months it will take us to develop our newly acquired space<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we'll prioritize purchasing the land itself with the funds we do raise. If we exceed our goal, we're going to allocate more money to environmental education activities at Bentangor. By engaging young people in conservation early, we can secure a future for orangutans and other rainforest biodiversity in the Gunung Palung landscape.<br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Although we were sad and disappointed to see that the rainforest next door to Bentangor had been cleared, we're aiming to make lemonade out of lemons and take advantage of the fact that this area is now for sale.

Every year, our environmental education programs positively impact over 4,000 area youth. Additionally, we work with adults in the area to promote ""forest-friendly"" livelihood activities, and much of this work happens at Bentangor. Our conservation model is truly community-based; we work with villages to find win-win solutions for people and wildlife, By purchasing this extra piece of land we will further solidify our presence in the area, building trust and grassroots support for conservation.

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Financing the 1 year Frogs &amp; Forest thesis project of Eleana J. Reategui Vilchez, UNAP Iquitos.</span><br/>
</h3> <p>We need help to finance the thesis &amp; postgraduate project of my student Eleana Jesabell Reategui Vilchez  at the UNAP University of Iquitos. The research project is located in a remnant forest outside of Iquitos and has a duration of one year.  Budget must cover all costs like materials and equipment, fees, licenses, transport,  terrarias, food, local assistant, scientific materials, molecular genetic research etc. .</p>
<p>At the moment, Eleana has invested with help of her family and small jobs 15.000 Soles (5000 USD) in infrastructure (Frog Lab)  and camera gear (Canon Rebel EOS 3i). I am supporting the project also with in kind donations and training as the scientific advisor to her thesis. Eleana has finished her exams and must now start her thesis project to obtain the Biologist title. The same project is designed to go on and provide all data for her postgraduate study (MSc).</p>
<p>Eleana will  go on with my work on Dendrobatid frogs in Peru using the World Bank award winning sustainable production methods ZIRA and ZIR I designed in 1999.  In the thesis project, she is applying the ZIRA method in the scientific mode and just found a new species not recorded previously in the selected forest plot. </p>
<p>Our outstanding research project on 4 Species of Ranitomeya which share a small remnant forest and live and breed side by side close together is totally new. We made some research on a model of 2 to 3 syntopic species in the Alto Cainarachi valley a few years ago- but this remnant forest at Iquitos surpasses all expectations: 4 species with similar colors and similar calls are forced together in a very limited habitat by the action of the famous Amazon Riverine Barrier. We want to know, how they share the habitat in all three dimensions, their limited breeding sites, and the food resources without problems and interferences. We know from captive breeding, that poison frog species from the same genus with a similar color and call can produce hybrids. Here we will be looking closely into this issue as it can be a severe problem for a species survival if the offspring is infertile or the genes of a species are ""diluted"" due to hybridization. <br/></p>
<p>At the same time, we will show how it is possible to restore species and populations of poison frogs with the ZIRA method in a heavily depleted rainforest remnant where people extracted all breeding plants (bromeliads) and  stole the frogs for illegal pet trade.  </p>
<p>Sponsors will be mentioned in the thesis and in the scientific papers about the findings.</p>
<p>When a biology student leaves an university in Peru, he or she has no tools, no GPS, no digital macro camera, no digital recorder for frog calls, very limited field &amp; species experience and therefore we senior specialits must help them. The research equipment acessible to the students of the UNAP  is in very bad shape and they have no trinocular digital  Photo Microscopes - so we must look for used microscopes and import them.(three types of research Photomicroscopes needed for this study: Preparation Zoom,  Inverted, and Compound High Magnification)!  <br/></p>
<p>This is our story and if you have a rainforest terraria with frogs or like to help young students to get their titles and improve their skills- fund this project please.</p>

Our outstanding research project on 4 Species of Ranitomeya which share a small remnant forest and live and breed side by side close together is totally new. We made some research on a model of 2 to 3 syntopic species in the Alto Cainarachi valley a few years ago- but this remnant forest at Iquitos surpasses all expectations: 4 species with similar colors and similar calls are forced together in a very limited habitat by the action of the famous Amazon Riverine Barrier. We want to know, how they share the habitat in all three dimensions, their limited breeding sites, and the food resources without problems and interferences. We know from captive breeding, that poison frog species from the same genus with a similar color and call can produce hybrids. Here we will be looking closely into this issue as it can be a severe problem for a species survival if the offspring is infertile or the genes of a species are ""diluted"" due to hybridization. 
At the same time, we will show how it is possible to restore species and populations of poison frogs with the ZIRA method in a heavily depleted rainforest remnant where people extracted all breeding plants (bromeliads) and  stole the frogs for illegal pet trade.  
Sponsors will be mentioned in the thesis and in the scientific papers about the findings.
When a biology student leaves an university in Peru, he or she has no tools, no GPS, no digital macro camera, no digital recorder for frog calls, very limited field & species experience and therefore we senior specialits must help them. The research equipment acessible to the students of the UNAP  is in very bad shape and they have no trinocular digital  Photo Microscopes - so we must look for used microscopes and import them.(three types of research Photomicroscopes needed for this study: Preparation Zoom,  Inverted, and Compound High Magnification)!  
This is our story and if you have a rainforest terraria with frogs or like to help young students to get their titles and improve their skills- fund this project please.

<p><span>Earthship Biotecture plans to build an off-grid, self-sustained home for a family living on Six Nations of the Grand River Territory, in the summer of 2015. </span></p>
<p>The Haudenosaunee family faces the colonial injustice of a housing crisis, and the countless obstacles which make getting a housing loan next to impossible for people who live far below the poverty line.</p>
<p>The family is in desperate need of a healthier and more cost effective shelter, as they have been living in a condemned trailer for years. The trailer has several holes where you can see straight through to the outside, a rodent infestation, mold, old brass pipes that get clogged constantly, next to no insulation, and a leaking roof. The owner does not think it will make it through the winter. She supports her daughter, who is a single mother, and 4 grandchildren, aged 4, 8, 11 and 15. She is their only family.</p>
<p>She will be welcoming all peoples to watch, participate and learn from this building process. She looks forward to being a part of showing that it takes grassroots people power to address the housing and energy crisis.</p>
<p>The new off grid home will be built using Architect, Michael Reynold's, Earthship design.  The Earthship Home features:</p>
<p> - Thermal &amp; Solar Heating and Cooling - Solar &amp; Wind Electricity</p>
<p> - Contained Sewage Treatment - Building with Natural &amp; Recycled Materials </p>
<p>- Water Harvesting</p>
<p> - Internal Food Production   </p>
<p>During the building process, we will host a free Sustainable Building Workshop for members of Six Nations interested in construction skill development. Our hope is to provide members of the community - especially youth-  with the skills needed to replicate the building, and an opportunity to develop a local sustainable building crew.   Through fundraising and public outreach, it is our hope that we will generate enough interest and financial support during this project, that we may continue to build and teach in other Indigenous communities throughout Canada.   </p>
<p>Primary Goals:  </p>
<p>- to prove that sustainable and affordable methods of housing exist.  </p>
<p>- to prove that with organization and skill development, communities can provide this housing for themselves with locally sourced labour and materials, through hands-on education and training.  </p>
<p>- to engage a community in an environmentally conscious project, to enhance community knowledge and understanding of sustainability concepts.  </p>
<p>- to provide a family with economic independence from fluctuating energy and water costs.  </p>
<p>- to offer a positive, and practical solution to a country wide housing and environmental crisis.</p>
<p>We need to raise $100, 000 for this project through donations and sponsorships.  Please consider making any contribution you can.</p>

<div><br/></div>
<h3>Santiago Romero &amp; Navajo Bee Project</h3>
<div>
<p>I was born at the Santa Fe Indian Hospital and grew up in the heart of Los Angeles but visited New Mexico every summer. My<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> father mentored with renowned Native American artist, sculptor and author </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Roxanne Swentzell and I discovered the joy of sculpting</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.
Working around Roxanne's farm and helping with her creative projects was my doorway to art and a passion for Native American rights and environmental protection.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I graduated from Dartmouth
with a degree in environmental science and a studio art minor. After returning to Santa Fe, I began working
with ceramic sculpture under the watchful gaze of my father and his uncle, two
renowned southwest artists. </span></p>
<p>A trip to Navajo Land in 2014 opened my eyes to the environmental degradation wrought by eighty years of uranium mining leaving over two thousand open mines that leak radioactivity into Navajo communities. Natural beekeeping, native plants and medicinal mushrooms can heal the land around these mines and protect the Navajo communities. </p>
<p>It a massive project and long overdue, but your donation will allow us to provide the Navajo with honeybees to pollinate native plants, pollinator gardens and even mushrooms to detoxify the soil!</p>
<p>Join the Hive!</p>
<h2>The Problem:</h2>
<p>This is a map of some of the over 2,000 uranium mines leaking radiation on Navajo land. Some of these mines have been open since WW2 and have caused massive damage to Navajo people, livestock and plant life. Many are close to rivers that spread the radioactivity hundreds of miles downstream. This is no longer just a Navajo problem, but everyone's problem.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1372059/files/20150410101250-Uranium_Mines_on_Navajo_Land_Page_1.jpg?1428685970"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h2>The Solution:</h2>
<p>The Navajo People have received funds to cap these mines so they no longer leak radiation. However there is a massive amount of work that needs to be done to clean up over seventy years worth of radioactivity and destruction to human health, rural economies, livestock and plant life.</p>
<p>This summer we will begin placing honeybees, native bee nests, medicinal mushrooms and other pollinators on Navajo Land. </p>
<p>Including:</p>
<p>~ Honey bees to pollinate plants and provide honey to create income for their Navajo beekeepers. </p>
<p>~ Native Bee Nests to encourage the over 4,000 types of solitary bees to thrive on the land and pollinate a variety of plants, tress and fruits.</p>
<p>~ Bat Houses to encourage bats to live on the lands to provide natural pest control.</p>
<p>~ Native grasses, flowers and shrubs to help the soil revive.</p>
<p>~ Bee gardens full of flowers, grasses and shrubs that bees, moths, hummingbirds, and other pollinators love.</p>
<p>~ Mushroom inoculation of the radioactive sites based on Paul Stamet's research to help increase the rate of detoxification by 10,000 fold. </p>
<p>~ Invite you to visit Navajo Land and see for yourself the awesome work your donation will make possible. Participate in celebration ceremonies for the bee hives and gardens. </p>

<br/>
<p><br/></p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are trying to raise $25,000 to gift 100 hives to Navajo people who have been affected by these mines. These hives will not only heal the land, but provide an ongoing source of income from the honey and wax they produce. Additionally, we want to plant 25 acres of native plants around the mine sites to provide pollen and nectar for the bees. </p>
<p>We have some awesome perks for you including Navajo Bee Project stickers, T Shirts, and coffee mugs! We will name hives and bee gardens after you and even invite you to Navajo Land!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>This is the first time since World War Two that the issue of uranium mining's aftermath is being addressed with an environmentally sound approach. Natural beekeeping is the perfect method to reclaim the damaged land, pollinate new plant growth and provide income for the Navajo. <span style=""background-color: initial;""> The Navajo Bee Project is the first step and we want you to experience Navajo culture!</span>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Natural Beekeeping is risky. We don't kill the queen every year to increase productivity like commercial beekeepers do. We don't treat the hives with miticides or pesticides nor feed the bees sugar water. Instead, we support the hive to be as healthy as possible. All our bees are sourced from natural beekeepers in the Southwest so they are acclimated to the climate, conditions and altitude. <br/><br/></p>
<p>The Navajo people are committed to making the project a success and all we need is  your support! Please make a donation of any amount and Join the Hive!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We give you a big Navajo welcome for just a buck, but you can also help in other ways! We are a small team centered in Santa Fe. Please help us get the word out!</p>

</div></div>","The Navajo People Are Being Poisoned by Radioactivity from Uranium Mines. Natural Beekeeping, Pollinator Gardens and Medicinal Mushrooms Can Help Them Stay Healthy and Heal Navajo Land! 

Santiago Romero & Navajo Bee Project

I was born at the Santa Fe Indian Hospital and grew up in the heart of Los Angeles but visited New Mexico every summer. My father mentored with renowned Native American artist, sculptor and author Roxanne Swentzell and I discovered the joy of sculpting.
Working around Roxanne's farm and helping with her creative projects was my doorway to art and a passion for Native American rights and environmental protection.
I graduated from Dartmouth
with a degree in environmental science and a studio art minor. After returning to Santa Fe, I began working
with ceramic sculpture under the watchful gaze of my father and his uncle, two
renowned southwest artists. 
A trip to Navajo Land in 2014 opened my eyes to the environmental degradation wrought by eighty years of uranium mining leaving over two thousand open mines that leak radioactivity into Navajo communities. Natural beekeeping, native plants and medicinal mushrooms can heal the land around these mines and protect the Navajo communities. 
It a massive project and long overdue, but your donation will allow us to provide the Navajo with honeybees to pollinate native plants, pollinator gardens and even mushrooms to detoxify the soil!
Join the Hive!
The Problem:
This is a map of some of the over 2,000 uranium mines leaking radiation on Navajo land. Some of these mines have been open since WW2 and have caused massive damage to Navajo people, livestock and plant life. Many are close to rivers that spread the radioactivity hundreds of miles downstream. This is no longer just a Navajo problem, but everyone's problem.


The Solution:
The Navajo People have received funds to cap these mines so they no longer leak radiation. However there is a massive amount of work that needs to be done to clean up over seventy years worth of radioactivity and destruction to human health, rural economies, livestock and plant life.
This summer we will begin placing honeybees, native bee nests, medicinal mushrooms and other pollinators on Navajo Land. 
Including:
~ Honey bees to pollinate plants and provide honey to create income for their Navajo beekeepers. 
~ Native Bee Nests to encourage the over 4,000 types of solitary bees to thrive on the land and pollinate a variety of plants, tress and fruits.
~ Bat Houses to encourage bats to live on the lands to provide natural pest control.
~ Native grasses, flowers and shrubs to help the soil revive.
~ Bee gardens full of flowers, grasses and shrubs that bees, moths, hummingbirds, and other pollinators love.
~ Mushroom inoculation of the radioactive sites based on Paul Stamet's research to help increase the rate of detoxification by 10,000 fold. 
~ Invite you to visit Navajo Land and see for yourself the awesome work your donation will make possible. Participate in celebration ceremonies for the bee hives and gardens. 





   What We Need & What You Get We are trying to raise $25,000 to gift 100 hives to Navajo people who have been affected by these mines. These hives will not only heal the land, but provide an ongoing source of income from the honey and wax they produce. Additionally, we want to plant 25 acres of native plants around the mine sites to provide pollen and nectar for the bees. 
We have some awesome perks for you including Navajo Bee Project stickers, T Shirts, and coffee mugs! We will name hives and bee gardens after you and even invite you to Navajo Land!

    The Impact
This is the first time since World War Two that the issue of uranium mining's aftermath is being addressed with an environmentally sound approach. Natural beekeeping is the perfect method to reclaim the damaged land, pollinate new plant growth and provide income for the Navajo.  The Navajo Bee Project is the first step and we want you to experience Navajo culture!


    Risks & Challenges Natural Beekeeping is risky. We don't kill the queen every year to increase productivity like commercial beekeepers do. We don't treat the hives with miticides or pesticides nor feed the bees sugar water. Instead, we support the hive to be as healthy as possible. All our bees are sourced from natural beekeepers in the Southwest so they are acclimated to the climate, conditions and altitude. 
The Navajo people are committed to making the project a success and all we need is  your support! Please make a donation of any amount and Join the Hive!

    Other Ways You Can Help We give you a big Navajo welcome for just a buck, but you can also help in other ways! We are a small team centered in Santa Fe. Please help us get the word out!
Join the Hive!
Mentors:
We created Navajo Bee Project based on the work of Coal County Beeworks in Kentucky who pioneered the use of honeybees in reclaiming mining lands.

Seit 2004 wurden ca. 200.000 Hektar Grünland oder Wald zu Ackerland
umgearbeitet, was bedeutet, dass jeden Tag ca. 80 Hektar Lebensraum
der heimischen Tier- und Pflanzenwelt verloren geht. Es gibt kaum
mehr Versteckmöglichkeiten für Wild oder Lebensräume für Insekten
oder Kleinsäugetiere. Vor allem im Gäuboden um Straubing herrscht
eine regelrechte Agrarwüste. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Die Grünstreifen und die ausgedehnten
Hecken müssen jährlich weiter der Industrialisierung unserer
Landwirtschaft weichen. Bienen und andere Insekten werden durch den
großflächigen Einsatz von Insektiziden zu ""bedrohten Arten"".
Feldränder, die früher noch Heimat von unzähligen Insekten, Nagern
und Pflanzen waren, werden vorbeugend mit Pestiziden behandelt. Dies
hat zur Folge, dass heutzutage die Feldränder mehr oder weniger

</p><p>Unser Projekt gliedert sich in 2
Phasen. Für Phase 1 stellen wir eine Fläche von 37.040 qm, die im Gäuboden liegt, zur Verfügung. Auf dieser Fläche
wollen wir natürliche Biotope anlegen. Diese Biotope sollen alles
bieten, was unsere Tier- und Pflanzenwelt benötigt, aber auch
gleichzeitig den Sponsoren unseres Projektes etwas bringen.</p>

erwirtschaften.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<b>Phase 2:</b> Wenn genug Interessenten zusammenkommen, würden wir
einen Verein gründen, um derartige Projekte überregional
umzusetzen. Dazu würden Flächen erworben und anschließend in unser
Konzept übernommen werden. Auch sollen Flächen geschaffen werden,
auf denen Gemüse so naturnah wie möglich gepflanzt wird. Hierfür
würden weitere 40.100 qm zur Verfügung stehen.</p>

werden  ca. 30 Hektar Feld, Wald oder Wiese zu Wohnraum umgebaut.
Seit 2004 wurden ca. 200.000 Hektar Grünland oder Wald zu Ackerland
umgearbeitet, was bedeutet, dass jeden Tag ca. 80 Hektar Lebensraum
der heimischen Tier- und Pflanzenwelt verloren geht. Es gibt kaum
mehr Versteckmöglichkeiten für Wild oder Lebensräume für Insekten
oder Kleinsäugetiere. Vor allem im Gäuboden um Straubing herrscht
eine regelrechte Agrarwüste. 


Die Grünstreifen und die ausgedehnten
Hecken müssen jährlich weiter der Industrialisierung unserer
Landwirtschaft weichen. Bienen und andere Insekten werden durch den
großflächigen Einsatz von Insektiziden zu ""bedrohten Arten"".
Feldränder, die früher noch Heimat von unzähligen Insekten, Nagern
und Pflanzen waren, werden vorbeugend mit Pestiziden behandelt. Dies
hat zur Folge, dass heutzutage die Feldränder mehr oder weniger
steril sind und somit für Tiere oder Pflanzen kaum oder keinen
Schutz oder Lebensraum mehr bietet.

Feuchtbiotope oder auch nur
""Feldsteinhaufen"", welche aus in Feldern gefundenen Steinen
bestehen, verschwinden in rasender Geschwindigkeit, obwohl sie
Lebensräume von zahlreichen - teils gefährdeten – Tier- und
Pflanzenarten sind.

Derzeit stehen 478 Namen auf der Roten
Liste von bedrohten oder ausgestorbenen Tier- oder Pflanzenarten
allein in Deutschland. 28 Prozent hiervon gelten als
bestandsgefährdet, 32 Arten sind bereits ausgestorben. Unsere
Feldhamster, der Kiebitz oder der Kampfläufer sind bedroht und
werden wohl auch früher oder später ganz verschwunden sein.


Wir sind eine Gruppe von
Junglandwirten, Landwirtskindern und teils Ökolandwirten, die zeigen
möchten, dass es auch anders geht. 


Unser Projekt gliedert sich in 2
Phasen. Für Phase 1 stellen wir eine Fläche von 37.040 qm, die im Gäuboden liegt, zur Verfügung. Auf dieser Fläche
wollen wir natürliche Biotope anlegen. Diese Biotope sollen alles
bieten, was unsere Tier- und Pflanzenwelt benötigt, aber auch
gleichzeitig den Sponsoren unseres Projektes etwas bringen.

Durch Baum-, Hecken-, oder Bienenpatenschaften können Sie der Natur helfen und gleichzeitig
Bio- Obst, Honig oder Saft bekommen.

Außerdem möchten wir diese Flächen
auch gerne für Schulausflüge als Naturerlebnisflächen oder
Naturlehrpfad zur Verfügung stellen, um unseren Kindern die Natur in
der heutigen Zeit wieder etwas näher zu bringen.



Phase 1: Besteht darin die vorhandene Fläche so natürlich
wie möglich zu gestalten und dennoch einen Ertrag daraus zu
erwirtschaften.


Phase 2: Wenn genug Interessenten zusammenkommen, würden wir
einen Verein gründen, um derartige Projekte überregional
umzusetzen. Dazu würden Flächen erworben und anschließend in unser
Konzept übernommen werden. Auch sollen Flächen geschaffen werden,
auf denen Gemüse so naturnah wie möglich gepflanzt wird. Hierfür
würden weitere 40.100 qm zur Verfügung stehen.


Planung der Umsetzung von Phase 1:

Anlegen einer artenreichen Bepflanzung
von Bäumen und Hecken, die möglichst vielen Tieren einen Lebensraum
bieten. Nach Möglichkeit sollen alte Obstsorten in Kombination mit
verschiedenen Laubbäumen gepflanzt werden. Die Fläche wird durch
eine möglichst abwechslungsreiche, durchgehende Hecke eingerahmt,
die vielen Tieren einen natürlichen Lebensraum bietet. Feuchtbiotope
sollen als Lebensraum für Libellen, Lurche, Frösche und Vögel
angelegt werden. Ebenso sollen Natursteinhaufen als Lebensraum für
Eidechsen oder Mäuse entstehen. 


Insgesamt planen wir 390 Bäume und
2.000 qm Hecke, 3 Natursteinhaufen und 2 Feuchtbiotope anzulegen. Auf
dieser gesamten Fläche werden dann anschließend 6 Bienenvölker
verteilt.
Die vorhandene Grasfläche wird nicht
gemäht, sondern einmal im Jahr von einem Schäfer abgeweidet werden,
um im Gras brütende Vögel nicht zu stören oder zu vertreiben.

Selbstverständlich verzichten wir
komplett auf Spritzmittel und Düngung.

Die  Aberntung der Bäume wird nicht
maschinell stattfinden, sondern per Hand um die Bäume so wenig wie
möglich zu belasten.


Um den Sponsoren unseres Projekts die
höchste Qualität zu bieten, werden wir die Flächen von Bioland
zertifizieren lassen.

Gerne können Sie uns besuchen und
mitmachen.

<h3>What we've done before the U Module</h3>
<div>We are a family of Uruguayan builders with 25 years of experience. We have worked with concrete, steel, adobes, canes and wood to build houses. As the years passed by, we gained awareness of pollution coming from concrete and steel production. Therefore, our constructions became more ecologic by building more with earth and wood. In the latest 15 years we have mainly built American wood framing houses.  </div>

<h3>Your impact</h3>
<div>Most people use cement, bricks and steel to build their homes. We want to offer a natural material to the world which methodology allows not only builders but anyone capable of using tools to build.  </div>
<div>By contributing to develop the U Module, you are helping mitigate climate change because U Module is a wood based material. Wood absorves CO2 for photosyntesis, and then emits Oxygen which we breath. On the other hand, concrete and steel don´t produce Oxygen; they produce CO2 in their initial manufacturing and every single time they are recycled.  Manufacturing wooden products implies a much lower impact.</div>
<div>In order to produce  1 tone of Portland Cement, 1 tone of CO2 is emitted. </div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></div>In order to produce  1 tone of steel,  1.8 tones of CO2 are emitted. <div><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></div>
<div>In order to produce  1 tone aluminium,  2.6 tones of CO2 are emitted. <br/>
</div>
<div><b>In order to produce 1 tone of sawn wood, 0.2 tone of CO2 is emitted. </b></div>

</div>
<div>
<div>U Modules can be easily applied in case of emergencies such as the recovery from wars or natural disasters because building can be done in record times.  Besides, the Modules are a light, which allow anyone build including women and children. At the same time, they can also build their own furniture like beds and tables. <br/>
</div>
<div>By contributing, you are helping people create, which enhances mental health of children, teenagers and adults. As we have explained perviously, with U Module you can create any furniture for your home. We commit to creating a manual to suggest ideas on how to build some of these furnitures. </div>
<div>Those who buy the product will also have a series of videos with demonstration of how to use the U Modules.</div>
<h3>Tu impacto</h3>
<div>
<i></i><p><i>La mayoría de la gente usa cemento, acero y cemento para construir su casa. Queremos ofrecerle al mundo un material natural cuya metodología permita que no solamente los constructores puedan construir, sino cualquier persona capáz.</i></p>
<p><i>Contribuyendo a desarrollar el U Module estás ayudando a mitigar el Cambio Climático porque el U Module es un material a base de madera. La madera asborve CO2  para la fotosíntesis, y luego exhala el Oxígeno que los seres humanos respiramos. Por otra parte, el hormigón y el acero no producen Oxígeno, producen CO2 en su producción inicial, y cada vez que son reciclados. La fabriación de productos de madera tiene un impacto mucho menor. </i></p>
<p><i>Para producir 1 tonelada de Portland, se emite 1 tonelada de CO2. </i></p>
<p><i>Para producir 1 tonelada de acero, se emiten 1,8 toneladas de CO2.</i></p>
<p><i>Para producir 1 tonelada de aluminio, se emiten 2,6 toneladas de CO2.</i></p>
<p><i>Para producir 1 tonelada de madera aserrada, se emite 0,2 tonelada de CO2.</i></p>
<p><i>U Modules se pueden aplicar fácilmente en caso de emergencia tales como en situaciones de guerra o desastres naturales porque la construcción se puede llevar a cabo en tiempo récord. Además, los U Modules son livianoes, lo que permiten que cualquiera construya, incluyendo mujeres y niños. Al mismo tiempo, también los pueden usar para construir sus propios muebles como camas y mesas. </i></p>
<p><i>Al contribuir, ayudarás a crear, lo que beneficia la salud mental de niños, adolescentes y adultos.  </i></p>
</div>
<div><i>Como hemos explicado antes, con el U Module podés crear mueblería para tu hogar. Nos comprometemos a crear un manual con ideas y sugerencias para tus muebles. </i></div>

Your impact
Most people use cement, bricks and steel to build their homes. We want to offer a natural material to the world which methodology allows not only builders but anyone capable of using tools to build.  
By contributing to develop the U Module, you are helping mitigate climate change because U Module is a wood based material. Wood absorves CO2 for photosyntesis, and then emits Oxygen which we breath. On the other hand, concrete and steel don´t produce Oxygen; they produce CO2 in their initial manufacturing and every single time they are recycled.  Manufacturing wooden products implies a much lower impact.
In order to produce  1 tone of Portland Cement, 1 tone of CO2 is emitted. 
In order to produce  1 tone of steel,  1.8 tones of CO2 are emitted. 
In order to produce  1 tone aluminium,  2.6 tones of CO2 are emitted. 

In order to produce 1 tone of sawn wood, 0.2 tone of CO2 is emitted.

U Modules can be easily applied in case of emergencies such as the recovery from wars or natural disasters because building can be done in record times.  Besides, the Modules are a light, which allow anyone build including women and children. At the same time, they can also build their own furniture like beds and tables. 

By contributing, you are helping people create, which enhances mental health of children, teenagers and adults. As we have explained perviously, with U Module you can create any furniture for your home. We commit to creating a manual to suggest ideas on how to build some of these furnitures. 
Those who buy the product will also have a series of videos with demonstration of how to use the U Modules.
Tu impacto

La mayoría de la gente usa cemento, acero y cemento para construir su casa. Queremos ofrecerle al mundo un material natural cuya metodología permita que no solamente los constructores puedan construir, sino cualquier persona capáz.
Contribuyendo a desarrollar el U Module estás ayudando a mitigar el Cambio Climático porque el U Module es un material a base de madera. La madera asborve CO2  para la fotosíntesis, y luego exhala el Oxígeno que los seres humanos respiramos. Por otra parte, el hormigón y el acero no producen Oxígeno, producen CO2 en su producción inicial, y cada vez que son reciclados. La fabriación de productos de madera tiene un impacto mucho menor. 
Para producir 1 tonelada de Portland, se emite 1 tonelada de CO2. 
Para producir 1 tonelada de acero, se emiten 1,8 toneladas de CO2.
Para producir 1 tonelada de aluminio, se emiten 2,6 toneladas de CO2.
Para producir 1 tonelada de madera aserrada, se emite 0,2 tonelada de CO2.
U Modules se pueden aplicar fácilmente en caso de emergencia tales como en situaciones de guerra o desastres naturales porque la construcción se puede llevar a cabo en tiempo récord. Además, los U Modules son livianoes, lo que permiten que cualquiera construya, incluyendo mujeres y niños. Al mismo tiempo, también los pueden usar para construir sus propios muebles como camas y mesas. 
Al contribuir, ayudarás a crear, lo que beneficia la salud mental de niños, adolescentes y adultos.  

Como hemos explicado antes, con el U Module podés crear mueblería para tu hogar. Nos comprometemos a crear un manual con ideas y sugerencias para tus muebles. 
Quienes compren el producto, también recibirán una serie de videos con demostraciones de cómo usar U Modules. 
Risks and challenges
You might be thinking What about fire? Our plan is to sell our U Modules painted with a coat of anti-fire painting. 
Some people may misunderstand how to use the U Modules, that's why those who buy the product will also have a series of videos with demonstration of how to use the U Modules.

Riesgos y retos
Debés estar pensando en el fuego verdad? Nuestro plan es vender nuestros U Modules cubiertos con pinturas anti-fuego.
Otro de los riesgos podría ser que quienes utilicen el U Module no entiendan como hacerlo, por eso quienes compren el producto también recibirán una serie de videos para entender como manipular los U Modules.

EcoSlick™ is a universal cleaner for your household, auto, mechanical, and industrial needs.
EcoSlick™ works best to keep metallic parts clean, moving, and protected against dirt, grime, rust, or other nasty particles and EcoSlick™ goes beyond that. EcoSlick™ has been known to clean sharpie off walls, sticky residue off surfaces, oven grease, and even squeaky door hinges! The best part is you can have ease of mind knowing EcoSlick™ is eco-friendly, biodegradable, and petroleum free.
EcoSlick™ is made from a citrus based technology with a finishing touch of a dry-coat lubricant. 
What is that? Dry-coat lubrication is a revolutionary technology which leaves a protective coating around the surfaces you clean, binding best with metals. This technology causes for a safe protection from outside elements by seeping into the pores of your newly cleaned surface and blocking nasty stuff out. Not only that, the more you use EcoSlick™ the less you have to use (on metallic surfaces) due to the dry-coat lubrication and it's beautiful technology to consistently protecting against the outside world. Who doesn't want to save some money?


 
 
Why?
Most homes harvest harmful cleaning chemicals which not only effect you negatively but also your children and pets. 
(see below fig. 1)

Not only that, if you use water distribution products most contain petroleum which we all know with the BP Oil Spill, and many other spills, is never beneficial for our Earth. 
(see below fig. 2)

 

The Impact
 
Almost all household and other cleaning products contain harmful chemicals such as 2-Butoxyethanol, ammonia, chlorine, and more which can cause bodily harm so severe you must immediately contact poison control centers if you come into contact. According to those poison control centers in 2014 there was “1 poison exposure reported to U.S. poison control centers every 15 seconds.” 
(fig. 1)

 

This is why we made EcoSlick™ safe, biodegradable, eco-friendly, and even citrus based! You don’t have to worry if you come into contact with it because it won’t damage your skin or harm your lungs if you breathe around it!

 
According to research done by International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) it is estimated that between the years 1970 and 2012 there have been approximately 5.75 million tonnes of oil spilled due to tanker incidents.
(fig. 2)
 
  

If we wean ourselves off of petroleum based products then we may begin to recover and not cause damage to our environment and Earth, the only one we have. That is why EcoSlick™ has created a petroleum free cleaner, a step towards a brighter future. 

 


Risks & Challenges
The challenges we face is not receiving enough funding to create a large enough production run to get the product to the general public. If this problem does occur then we will still begin our launch but in a much smaller size which may cause us to create pre-orders.

<p>One
of the largest problems facing global agriculture food production today is the pollution from Nitrate and Phosphorus rich, excess water
runoff.   The use of soil surface applied fertilizers and effluent from
livestock areas are major contributors to this problem when rain and irrigation
water turn into agriculture runoff. </p>

The Nitrate and Phosphorus rich water runoff pollutes groundwater
supplies of drinking water, as well as streams, rivers, lakes, and ocean
environments where it causes eutrophication. Eutrophication has become
a  global environmental problem that we can solve. </div><div>

</div></div>","EcosPure is offering Sustainable, Gardening and Agriculture products that conserve water, accelerate plant growth and clean up the environment. Together we can change the world, one planter, garden and farm at a time.
EcosPure has developed a new approach to growing plants with stunning results. We have developed  Pot, Planter and Garden Smart liners that absorb water like a sponge when you water your plants. This Smart material liner holds onto the Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium (plant nutrients) and water in the plant root zone. The liner then slowly releases the plant nutrients and the water back to the plant, conserving water and enabling your plants to grow faster.




How does it work?





GrowSmart Oasis™ 
Is not
a fertilizer, but a plant nutrient magnet that traps the plant nutrients at the
root zone of the plant, for the plant to use, and stops the nutrients from being
washed away when you water. 



Laboratory testing of
plant growth over 14 days, under 24 hour grow lights, demonstrated an average
increase of up to 15% in plant growth height and an average increase of
over 25% in the number of leaves or branches over control plants using the same
amount of fertilizer when the plant roots were in contact with the GrowSmart
Oasis material.






Using GrowSmart Oasis in your planters, gardens and landscape reduces the amount of seasonal irrigation water needed by up to 25% or more while dramatically reducing Nitrates, Phosphorus and Potassium nutrient percolation into ground water systems which can end up polluting your drinking water.

GrowSmart Oasis™  for home indoor and outdoor planter and garden use is made of bio-friendly materials.  



Pot, planter and garden liners are available in several sizes and shapes that fit #1  pots up to #10 pots, for size reference go to ANSI horiculture standards. Flat discs and squares are available for larger pots and planters up to 36 inches in diameter or square. 



Just place plants on top of the GrowSmart Oasis material fill in with your favorite potting soils or garden earth, fertilize and water as needed and let your plants do the rest.
Larger rolls of material are available in Growers Rolls in
1"", 2"", 3"" and 4"" widths. While wider Garden Rolls are
available in 12"", 24"", 36"". and 48"" widths in 10 ft., 50 ft. and 100 ft. lengths. 

EcosPure GrowSmart Oasis products are made in the US with our new bio-friendly smart materials
that store the water and fertilizer nutrients for your
plants and keeps them available for later use by the plants, just like an
oasis. 


The liners allow water to pass through but keep the nutrients from
leaching out the bottom of your pot, planter or garden improving the amount of
nutrients available to your plants each time you water. 

Using
GrowSmart Oasis material will help produce the most beautiful plants you have
ever grown.

How does it help the Ecosystem ?


One
of the largest problems facing global agriculture food production today is the pollution from Nitrate and Phosphorus rich, excess water
runoff.   The use of soil surface applied fertilizers and effluent from
livestock areas are major contributors to this problem when rain and irrigation
water turn into agriculture runoff. 

The Nitrate and Phosphorus rich water runoff pollutes groundwater
supplies of drinking water, as well as streams, rivers, lakes, and ocean
environments where it causes eutrophication. Eutrophication has become
a  global environmental problem that we can solve. 








What is Eutrophication?   
Eutrophication
is excessive richness of nutrients, ie
Nitrogen and Phosphorus, in an ocean, lake or other body of water, most
frequently caused by runoff from agricultural land, which causes a dense growth
of plant life and then death of
animal life from lack of oxygen in the water environment.












The dense growth of plant life often results in algae
blooms. Algae blooms can be toxic and so large that they can be viewed from
space, as seen in the Great Lakes image below, lighter green areas in the water are
algae blooms (NASA Image).






EcosPure NPK Mat™  (below) for
agriculture runoff. The NPK Mat stops the dissolved Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium before it can enter the watershed and cause the harmful algae blooms. 

EcosPure products have bio-compatible smart materials that tackle the agriculture runoff pollution head on by attracting target pollutants that are in the runoff water and holding on to them so they do not enter the watershed ecosystem.


EcosPure NPK Mat is available in three different thicknesses all made of natural materials.


In Agriculture areas the EcosPure NPK Mat is installed in a farm runoff
area or in catch basins areas.





Once in contact with runoff water the NPK Mat strips the Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium molecules
out of the runoff water that comes into contact with it, dramatically reducing
the harmful components of the agriculture runoff that can enter the watershed. 


Here’s the Science behind How It Works  
The EcosPure materials absorb up to 10 times their weight in water and then slowly release it back to the soil and plant. The molecules we put into the smart materials that coat the natural mats and fabric attract the target pollutant molecules and separate them from the water.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Soil is NOT a kitchen sponge!  Soil is the living, breathing, bio-diverse skin of the Earth; or at least it is supposed to be.  As the results of our soil testing piled up, we found that only a small portion of land has been well-tended by gardeners who realize the importance of soil.  The vast majority of this land is grass, and our testing has shown that soil under grass, especially lawns, is deficient in LIFE.  Several textbooks, universities, soil scientists and most extension offices agree that <i>5% organic matter</i> (life) is the optimum level to have in the soil.  Typically soil under grass will have between 1-2% organic matter and often times less.  It is our goal, with this campaign to change this by raising soil organic matter on land owned and operated by non-profit organizations.  </span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447104795/diadxuc3mzzimcrlpt9w.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Parks, schools, churches and non-profit organizations simply cannot address the issues of poor soil due to the lack of funding and the lack of knowledge.  Thousands of acres, in each state, across the United States are under baseball fields, soccer fields, open spaces and lawns and each acre can be used to combat climate change.</p>
<p>The term climate change is used so often and it may be difficult to hear from yet another project.  Soil is the largest carbon storage system on Earth.  Soil is so effective at storing carbon we have been able to power our lives with its coal for over 100 years.  More carbon is stored in soil than anywhere else, which is one reason large companies are looking at something called carbon sequestration.  One form of sequestration requires carbon dioxide be captured as it is released at factories or power plants and it is piped into (you guessed it) the ground.  This system doesn't work for houses and things that move like cars and airplanes. The other way we can sequester carbon in the soil is to use plants and microorganisms. Plants use carbon in the air to grow roots, and through those roots they deposit sugar (also made from carbon) into the soil. After every rain, as water soaks into the ground, it is replaced by air containing more carbon dioxide. This is the action that breathes life into microorganisms (also made of carbon), if they are there. Increasing the life in the soil means increasing carbon sequestration and reducing the carbon in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Alone, we cannot condition the soil, provide the microorganisms currently missing from the soil, and supply the food to support this life. To make this happen, we need everyone's help. Our business is growing quickly, but not quickly enough to be able to provide this for free for the places that need it the most.  Our modern lives today, all release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Please help us pull that carbon back out of the air and put it into the ground.</p>

<p>Even today, manure is a great form of soil organic matter and food for microbes. These t-shirts are trying to bring awareness to the lack of organic matter in the soil and how easily it can be replenished.  From left to right, worm castings, or worm poop, is an excellent source of nutrition for plants, microbes and organic matter. Chicken manure is a staple for feeding grass as it is a slow-release plant food that is abundant and inexpensive.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Rabbit manure is also a great supplement as it is high in nitrogen and organic matter.  Cow manure is cow manure, few have not heard or smelled its benefits.</span></p>
<h3>The Expected Results</h3>
<br/><p>Each funding level shows how much ground is being improved with that investment.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: What is the goal to this project?</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: To increase the amount of organic matter in the top six inches of soil on properties controlled by non-profit organizations.  Improvements will be demonstrated with soil tests.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: Will this change the current way these organizations work with their ground?</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A: It will be </span>advisable<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to follow fertilizing instructions provided with the soil test and to limit </span>herbicide<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and pesticide use, otherwise the land can be used as before. All products supplied will be natural or organic.</span></span></p>
<p>Q: What happens if you get more than your requested amount?</p>
<p>A: We will expand, hire more people and possibly continue the project into Fall 2016. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our suppliers are capable of producing the biology and products to support much more than we hope to raise during this campaign. Tens of thousands of acres can be improved with the products available to us. </span></p>
<p>Millions of active biologicals turn into billions within a few short weeks when properly taken care of.  A small input now reaps huge rewards in a short time.</p>
<p>If you do own a car, but do not own a yard, we have t-shirts and hats and stuff to show your support of the environment.  If you have soil that could use improvement there are several perks that allow you to improve your soil and soil that couldn't be helped without you.  If you own a business or have a very generous heart, the top supporters will be awarded a high quality plaque showing exactly how much land you have improved.</p>
<p>Q: If you don't reach your goal, what happens then?</p>
<p>A: We will do the maximum we can with what we are funded.</p>
<p>****The whole is greater than its parts****  Volume discounts are a big deal in the natural soil amendment industry.  More funding means discounts on products and more area <span style=""background-color: initial;"">improved</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> per dollar.  Please don't keep this to yourself, let others know and lets get a larger area of soil pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The first step of this process is to make soil a happy home for living things.  We</span><br style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">want healthy bacteria and fungus in the soil and healthy roots in the soil, these living things work together to improve soil fertility, water holding, carbon capture and improve the quality of the plants on top of the soil.  We use a product which is an anionic fluid made of all natural products (palm oil extracts, molasses extracts, lemon extracts and others)  which helps small soil particles from sticking to each other too closely and allow air and water to percolate through the soil.</span></p>
<p>The second step is to add the actual life into the soil.  This ranges from chemolithotrophic bacteria (doesn't need light but does need CO2) and photolithotrophic bacteria (does need light and CO2) and various forms of mycorrhiza fungus (umm....<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> wikipedia</a> that one).</p>

</div></div>","Living Soil Is Important
 If there is a church, park or school you would like to benefit from this project, please let us know by email, Facebook, USPS or however!

Soil is NOT a kitchen sponge!  Soil is the living, breathing, bio-diverse skin of the Earth; or at least it is supposed to be.  As the results of our soil testing piled up, we found that only a small portion of land has been well-tended by gardeners who realize the importance of soil.  The vast majority of this land is grass, and our testing has shown that soil under grass, especially lawns, is deficient in LIFE.  Several textbooks, universities, soil scientists and most extension offices agree that 5% organic matter (life) is the optimum level to have in the soil.  Typically soil under grass will have between 1-2% organic matter and often times less.  It is our goal, with this campaign to change this by raising soil organic matter on land owned and operated by non-profit organizations.  


Parks, schools, churches and non-profit organizations simply cannot address the issues of poor soil due to the lack of funding and the lack of knowledge.  Thousands of acres, in each state, across the United States are under baseball fields, soccer fields, open spaces and lawns and each acre can be used to combat climate change.
The term climate change is used so often and it may be difficult to hear from yet another project.  Soil is the largest carbon storage system on Earth.  Soil is so effective at storing carbon we have been able to power our lives with its coal for over 100 years.  More carbon is stored in soil than anywhere else, which is one reason large companies are looking at something called carbon sequestration.  One form of sequestration requires carbon dioxide be captured as it is released at factories or power plants and it is piped into (you guessed it) the ground.  This system doesn't work for houses and things that move like cars and airplanes. The other way we can sequester carbon in the soil is to use plants and microorganisms. Plants use carbon in the air to grow roots, and through those roots they deposit sugar (also made from carbon) into the soil. After every rain, as water soaks into the ground, it is replaced by air containing more carbon dioxide. This is the action that breathes life into microorganisms (also made of carbon), if they are there. Increasing the life in the soil means increasing carbon sequestration and reducing the carbon in the atmosphere.
Alone, we cannot condition the soil, provide the microorganisms currently missing from the soil, and supply the food to support this life. To make this happen, we need everyone's help. Our business is growing quickly, but not quickly enough to be able to provide this for free for the places that need it the most.  Our modern lives today, all release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Please help us pull that carbon back out of the air and put it into the ground.


DEEZ BUTTS

Even today, manure is a great form of soil organic matter and food for microbes. These t-shirts are trying to bring awareness to the lack of organic matter in the soil and how easily it can be replenished.  From left to right, worm castings, or worm poop, is an excellent source of nutrition for plants, microbes and organic matter. Chicken manure is a staple for feeding grass as it is a slow-release plant food that is abundant and inexpensive.  Rabbit manure is also a great supplement as it is high in nitrogen and organic matter.  Cow manure is cow manure, few have not heard or smelled its benefits.
The Expected Results
Each funding level shows how much ground is being improved with that investment.
Q: What is the goal to this project?
A: To increase the amount of organic matter in the top six inches of soil on properties controlled by non-profit organizations.  Improvements will be demonstrated with soil tests.
Q: Will this change the current way these organizations work with their ground?
A: It will be advisable to follow fertilizing instructions provided with the soil test and to limit herbicide and pesticide use, otherwise the land can be used as before. All products supplied will be natural or organic.
Q: What happens if you get more than your requested amount?
A: We will expand, hire more people and possibly continue the project into Fall 2016. Our suppliers are capable of producing the biology and products to support much more than we hope to raise during this campaign. Tens of thousands of acres can be improved with the products available to us. 
Millions of active biologicals turn into billions within a few short weeks when properly taken care of.  A small input now reaps huge rewards in a short time.
If you do own a car, but do not own a yard, we have t-shirts and hats and stuff to show your support of the environment.  If you have soil that could use improvement there are several perks that allow you to improve your soil and soil that couldn't be helped without you.  If you own a business or have a very generous heart, the top supporters will be awarded a high quality plaque showing exactly how much land you have improved.
Q: If you don't reach your goal, what happens then?
A: We will do the maximum we can with what we are funded.
****The whole is greater than its parts****  Volume discounts are a big deal in the natural soil amendment industry.  More funding means discounts on products and more area improved per dollar.  Please don't keep this to yourself, let others know and lets get a larger area of soil pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.
 
    The Process 


                                       
The first step of this process is to make soil a happy home for living things.  Wewant healthy bacteria and fungus in the soil and healthy roots in the soil, these living things work together to improve soil fertility, water holding, carbon capture and improve the quality of the plants on top of the soil.  We use a product which is an anionic fluid made of all natural products (palm oil extracts, molasses extracts, lemon extracts and others)  which helps small soil particles from sticking to each other too closely and allow air and water to percolate through the soil.
The second step is to add the actual life into the soil.  This ranges from chemolithotrophic bacteria (doesn't need light but does need CO2) and photolithotrophic bacteria (does need light and CO2) and various forms of mycorrhiza fungus (umm.... wikipedia that one).
Step three will be to add the food for all this bacterial that has just been added to the soil.  Depending on the soil type, this could be a compost product or a liquid carbohydrate.  Compost teas are also effective at feeding soil bacteria.  
These three processes are the most effective and inexpensive way to take existing soil and improve its quality and capture carbon from the atmosphere.  That is our focus however is should be known that improving organic matter in soil also improves water retention (less flooding problems), water retention (drought mitigation), cation exchange (how well soil holds onto fertilizers) and fertility (how well plants grow) among many other beneficial factors.
The impact of soil biology can not be overstated.   What Worries Us  2015 was declared by the UN as the year of the soil, however in 2015 we have also seen the hottest year on record.  Never before have there been 3 category 3 hurricanes in the pacific at one time, and in 2015 there were 3 category 4 hurricanes at one time.  Hurricane Patricia went from tropical storm to the most intense hurricane ever recorded in 30 hours.  We are worried that we will simply not be able to do enough to help the planet soon enough.  We couldn't hope to achieve any of this goal without your help within the next 15 years.  With your help, we can help plants and the ground sequester billions of pounds of carbon in the soil.   Other Ways You Can Help If you have a yard, please test your soil.   If you don't have nitrogen but do have phosphorus, DO NOT put a balanced fertilizer down.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">So besides the fact that planting a tree is a great thing, your tree, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">during it´s lifetime of growth, reproduction and decomposition, contribute towards ensuring biodiversity in the following ways:</span>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><ul>
<li>
<span style=""text-align: center;""><b>Trees promote the return of endangered species</b>.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""text-align: center; letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Trees, through photosynthesis, are primarily responsible for providing part of the oxygen we breathe</b> and remove carbon dioxide, which causes global warming leading to the dreaded greenhouse effect. </span><span style=""text-align: center; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Each tree absorbs about 25 kg of carbon emissions each year.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""text-align: center; letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Trees protect the soil from erosion</b>. </span><span style=""text-align: center; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Their branches and leaves stop the direct impact of water droplets. The water descends slower through the trunk or falls from the branches or leaves, so it gets more chance to infiltrate the soil. This ensures that a greater proportion of water is retained in the subsurface reserves and less water runs over the surface, reducing their erosive effect. </span><span style=""text-align: center; letter-spacing: 0px;"">The roots of the trees also form a network that holds the soil and helps protect it.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">In the woods, or in areas with vegetation, surface minerals are drawn to a much lesser extent than in bare lands. In areas with few trees, few shrubs or grass, little quantities of water can form large grooves on the earth and impoverish the land – turning it sterile. The current large deserts were great forests in the past. Trees also act as a shield against the wind, another important erosive factor.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;""><b>The trees stop the wind</b> and keep it from dragging the materials to another place and push them hard against the very ground which favors its disintegration. The importance of wind on the landscape can be clrearly seen in places bare of vegetation such as deserts, where the sand entrainment by wind changes the dunes constantly. In many cities next to deserts trees are planted to prevent the advance of desert.</span><br/>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;""><b>Forests also act positively against temperature changes</b>, another soil destructive factor. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">The differences of heat and cold between day and night produce its disintegration and help accelerate the erosion process. The sun shines directly on the bare earth and increases the evaporation of water, drying the ground. In forest areas soil moisture is plentiful.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;""><b>Trees have provided medicines for centuries</b>, in particular against malaria, acidity, measles, lung diseases, rheumatism, influenza, and leprosy, among others....</span><br/>
</li>

That´s why we are going to protect and plant trees in a dry forest. Lots of them. 
With our campaign you can adopt a tree in the Natural Reserve Los Tananeos in the north of Colombia, and be sure your tree is being taken care of to guarantee it´s survival.

Por eso vamos a proteger y plantar árboles...Muchos árboles.

Con esta campaña puedes adoptar un árbol en la Reserva Natural
Los Tananeos en el norte de Colombia. Nosotros nos encargaremos de  garantizar su supervivencia dentro del bosque.

Where?
Natural Reserve Los Tananeos is located at only 30 minutes from the capital of the department of Cesar, in the foothills of the Serranía del Perija, Colombia. Since it´s inception in 2010, the reserve has become a benchmark for the conservation of fauna and flora in the region.
The Tananeos tree, which gives the name to the Reserve can be found, but also Ceiba, Cedar, Laurel, and Willow trees, Caracolíes, Cocoa and many other varieties that dot the Reserve with the color of life.


Why?
Do you know the importance of Tropical Dry Forests for our planet? 

These bio-diverse ecosystems are extremely resistant to weather fluctuations due to climate change. 
They are also the first forest ecosystem on the Colombian Caribbean coast that provide a resting place, food, and shelter to millions of migratory birds of over 60 species that land on the coast after their trip crossing the Caribbean Sea.

Tropical Dry Forests have been destroyed for timber, mineral extraction, and commercial farming. Their destruction has negatively impacted the communities that depend on these forests,  affects the global climate, and causes the extinction of many species specific to this ecosystem.
Our mission as a Natural Reserve is to contribute to the conservation and restoration of our Tropical Dry Forest and protect its main species from extinction.

We are already on our way...


With the support of Patrimonio Natural and USAID, we have built a greenhouse to reproduce native trees in critical danger of extinction. For a start, we have planted the first 500 trees in the greenhouse. These trees are now ready to be transplanted to their final place in the Reserve. 

But we need your help.
We are asking for your help to transplant the seedlings from the greenhouse to deforested areas within the Reserve and ensure their survival over the next two years.
We have also many trees in danger of extinction that have naturally grown in devastated areas  since we initiated the conservation project in the reserve.  These trees are now competing with many other species and they have very little chance to survive unless we help them with some maintenance work.
If you want to contribute, Ideally you adopt a tree for at least two years. In this way, you make sure that your tree is taken care of during the most vulnerable period of it´s lifetime.



In order to plant the trees we need to do lots of things:
Preparation of the terrain (€814)This includes levelling and cleaning up deforested areas, preparing pathways in order to access the planted trees for maintenance.
Planting of the trees and maintenance during 2 years (€3,034)This includes transplanting the trees, plague and illness control,watering, maintenance personnel during two years, daily inspections, reseeding...Various materials needed during 2 years (€889)There´s lots of stuff we need to take care of the trees, such as organic fertilizer (everything we do is organic and natural), limestone, natural water retainers, various species of native seeds, volcanic rock, gardening supplies....Communication (€170)To make this campaign a success we develop a website, we need hosting, images..Various overhead (€717)In a project like this there´s always unexpected costs, so we calculated a % for this as well. Anything that is not being used of this budget item is going straight into planting more trees!
Crowdfunding fees (€495)The percentage that indiegogo takes is added to the budget as well. 

This brings us to a total budget of €6,119 which will allow us to plant and take care of  1,500 trees during 2 years.
As your support comes in, we immediately convert this into planting and protecting trees. As a matter of fact, we are in the Reserve right now making all the preparations needed to start planting. This is why this is a flexible campaign- the more money comes in, the more trees we plant, although our objective for now is plant  maintain 1,500 trees during 2 years. Afterwards, we plant 2,000 to 3,000 trees each year!

What´s in it for you?
People plant trees for lots of reasons. To celebrate the birth of a new family member, a birthday, to mark a special milestone in life, to honour a deceased loved one or, to save the planet or, simply, because it makes them feel good!

So besides the fact that planting a tree is a great thing, your tree, during it´s lifetime of growth, reproduction and decomposition, contribute towards ensuring biodiversity in the following ways:



Trees promote the return of endangered species.


Trees, through photosynthesis, are primarily responsible for providing part of the oxygen we breathe and remove carbon dioxide, which causes global warming leading to the dreaded greenhouse effect. Each tree absorbs about 25 kg of carbon emissions each year.


Trees protect the soil from erosion. Their branches and leaves stop the direct impact of water droplets. The water descends slower through the trunk or falls from the branches or leaves, so it gets more chance to infiltrate the soil. This ensures that a greater proportion of water is retained in the subsurface reserves and less water runs over the surface, reducing their erosive effect. The roots of the trees also form a network that holds the soil and helps protect it.


In the woods, or in areas with vegetation, surface minerals are drawn to a much lesser extent than in bare lands. In areas with few trees, few shrubs or grass, little quantities of water can form large grooves on the earth and impoverish the land – turning it sterile. The current large deserts were great forests in the past. Trees also act as a shield against the wind, another important erosive factor.


The trees stop the wind and keep it from dragging the materials to another place and push them hard against the very ground which favors its disintegration. The importance of wind on the landscape can be clrearly seen in places bare of vegetation such as deserts, where the sand entrainment by wind changes the dunes constantly. In many cities next to deserts trees are planted to prevent the advance of desert.


Forests also act positively against temperature changes, another soil destructive factor. The differences of heat and cold between day and night produce its disintegration and help accelerate the erosion process. The sun shines directly on the bare earth and increases the evaporation of water, drying the ground. In forest areas soil moisture is plentiful.


Trees have provided medicines for centuries, in particular against malaria, acidity, measles, lung diseases, rheumatism, influenza, and leprosy, among others....


So all this is fantastic. But we also provide unique perks, including a t-shirt, a guided visits to our reserve, and even a course for recognising and using medicinal plants.

About us
Our reserve is managed by the nonprofit organization “FUNDACIÓN RESERVA NATURAL LOS TANANEOS” which has a clear purpose of contributing to preserve the environment, fauna, flora, biodiversity and water resources of our region, and to investigate and find sustainable solutions in the use of our natural resources.
Since 2010, with an integrated team of professionals from various disciplines, united by the shared passion for nature, we have achieved these accomplishments:


Environmental Education:¨Guardians of the Forest¨ program; a growing group of children and adults engaged in learning, care for and preserve the natural heritage, ecosystems and biodiversity of the Cesar Region.



Reforestation:-400 fruit trees planted in 2012-Construction of our greenhouse for the propagation of forest species in critical danger of extinction


We have allocated 170.14 hectares as Forest Reserve, where native species are protected from the pressures that human population has on them.



Conservation and recovery program Tananeo tree (Peltogyne Purpurea):With the support of the Colombian Corporation for Agricultural Research CORPOICA.



Green building:Construction of the ecological house ¨Los Tananeos¨. Construction began on July 1, 2013, with the celebration of a course in Bio Construction, Ecoarchitecture, bioclimate, water management and renewable energy. We have completed advanced since then 45% of the project and the goal is to finish the house in 2016.



Organic food production:We explore different methods of sustainable agriculture in our reserve.




The reserve became an official National Reserve in Colombia, recognised by the national authorities as of February 2015.

</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The construction of
the first earthship on a University campus takes time, patience, and most of
all persistence. It started off with the desire to provide a functional example of a livable structure built off of recycled materials. And that defines an earthship!</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">In order to break
away from a wasteful, consumer-driven lifestyle, we must first look
at the place that we call home. Most homes in the United States are unsustainable due to their energy usage and construction practices.</p><ul>
<li><p><span>48% of most household energy usage goes toward heating and cooling (USEIA)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Traditional planning ignores the house’s orientation in relation to ground slope or exposure to the  sun</p></li>
<li><p>Most homes rely on city water, depleting water sources such as aquifers by using over 40,000 gallons of water per home, per year</p></li>
</ul><p style=""text-align: center;"">In contrast, an earthship is a fully sustainable, off-grid structure. The larger environmental impacts of construction significantly influence the design of the structure.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>What is an earthship?</b></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The
structure of an earthship is built with tires that have been pounded full of dirt. Empty cans and bottles are upcycled by incorporating them into the walls to increase insulation. The inner and outer façade is covered in cob or adobe. There is a rain catching, storing, and filtering system which supplies the building's water needs. After the water has been used in a sink or shower, the resulting greywater is sent to the indoor
greenhouse to water plants. Excess water from the greenhouse is used in the toilet. Black water is sent to
a solar septic tank. An earthship is designed to be completely off-grid, electricity is sourced from solar panels. As a Sustainability Science major, the idea of having
Montclair University’s 20,000 students, and its surrounding communities,
understand that we can live without depleting natural resources was a powerful
enough motive to pursue this ambitious endeavor.</p>

It was obvious from
the start that completing this project would not be possible without a dedicated group of
environmentally conscious people working with me. Therefore, an e-mail was sent out to the Earth and
Environmental Science department looking for environmentally conscious students
on October 10th, 2014. Over ten enthusiastic emails and three days later we had
our first Environmental Club meeting where almost ten people showed up. A week
later a few of us made the initial trip to Silver Lake Nature Center’s
Earthship build in Bucks County, Bristol Pennsylvania. Here we met the spearhead
of the first public earthship on the East coast and got the idea to run a
sustainable education center demonstration building. We also met the CEO of
Earthship 360, who came to give a lecture at our University two weeks later. At
around this time, a club member and his friend made a clay model of an earthship, which we would use at meetings with the Dean of the
College of Science and Mathematics. His support and mentorship led us to some
influential relationships that have been helpful along the way. The Director of
the PSEG Institute for Sustainability Studies, Montclair Township’s
Sustainability Officer, MSU’s Director of Environmental Health and Safety, and
the CEO of Green Building Center are just some of the influential people who
have each helped in their own way. They all have mentor roles but the most
important piece of our organization is the dedicated group of students who work
diligently toward making this world a better place. We are all on the same
sustainable page, which makes working together productive and entertaining. We
joke around, go on camping trips, hike and volunteer together, all while
balancing our favorite hobbies, classes, jobs, and sports. The foundation was
laid out clearly by the end of the spring semester and this momentum would
carry us forward into the next fall.</p>

year, but with a fundraising plan, we would be primed  to bring this proposal to our University President. The budget estimate starts at $300,000 and fundraising that type of money is a
daunting task for a newly chartered environmental club.  At the end of last spring, we submitted a proposal for an award from the United States Green Building council
for their Innovative Sustainability Initiative category. Finding out that we will be given an honorable mention at
the USGBC’s Emerald Award Gala made us feel proud of everything we have
accomplished thus far. It felt as if this award set the stage for the future of
this project and there was no stopping us now! This journey has taught us a lot
in one year, but we are looking forward to taking the next big step and getting
the University’s approval to make this dream a reality. With this much

The construction of
the first earthship on a University campus takes time, patience, and most of
all persistence. It started off with the desire to provide a functional example of a livable structure built off of recycled materials. And that defines an earthship!In order to break
away from a wasteful, consumer-driven lifestyle, we must first look
at the place that we call home. Most homes in the United States are unsustainable due to their energy usage and construction practices.
48% of most household energy usage goes toward heating and cooling (USEIA)
Traditional planning ignores the house’s orientation in relation to ground slope or exposure to the  sun
Most homes rely on city water, depleting water sources such as aquifers by using over 40,000 gallons of water per home, per year
In contrast, an earthship is a fully sustainable, off-grid structure. The larger environmental impacts of construction significantly influence the design of the structure.What is an earthship?The
structure of an earthship is built with tires that have been pounded full of dirt. Empty cans and bottles are upcycled by incorporating them into the walls to increase insulation. The inner and outer façade is covered in cob or adobe. There is a rain catching, storing, and filtering system which supplies the building's water needs. After the water has been used in a sink or shower, the resulting greywater is sent to the indoor
greenhouse to water plants. Excess water from the greenhouse is used in the toilet. Black water is sent to
a solar septic tank. An earthship is designed to be completely off-grid, electricity is sourced from solar panels. As a Sustainability Science major, the idea of having
Montclair University’s 20,000 students, and its surrounding communities,
understand that we can live without depleting natural resources was a powerful
enough motive to pursue this ambitious endeavor.
                                                                (Earthship, during construction, at Silver Lake Nature Center, Bucks County, PA)  
Who Are We?
It was obvious from
the start that completing this project would not be possible without a dedicated group of
environmentally conscious people working with me. Therefore, an e-mail was sent out to the Earth and
Environmental Science department looking for environmentally conscious students
on October 10th, 2014. Over ten enthusiastic emails and three days later we had
our first Environmental Club meeting where almost ten people showed up. A week
later a few of us made the initial trip to Silver Lake Nature Center’s
Earthship build in Bucks County, Bristol Pennsylvania. Here we met the spearhead
of the first public earthship on the East coast and got the idea to run a
sustainable education center demonstration building. We also met the CEO of
Earthship 360, who came to give a lecture at our University two weeks later. At
around this time, a club member and his friend made a clay model of an earthship, which we would use at meetings with the Dean of the
College of Science and Mathematics. His support and mentorship led us to some
influential relationships that have been helpful along the way. The Director of
the PSEG Institute for Sustainability Studies, Montclair Township’s
Sustainability Officer, MSU’s Director of Environmental Health and Safety, and
the CEO of Green Building Center are just some of the influential people who
have each helped in their own way. They all have mentor roles but the most
important piece of our organization is the dedicated group of students who work
diligently toward making this world a better place. We are all on the same
sustainable page, which makes working together productive and entertaining. We
joke around, go on camping trips, hike and volunteer together, all while
balancing our favorite hobbies, classes, jobs, and sports. The foundation was
laid out clearly by the end of the spring semester and this momentum would
carry us forward into the next fall.
                                                                  
Many strides were made during the first school
year, but with a fundraising plan, we would be primed  to bring this proposal to our University President. The budget estimate starts at $300,000 and fundraising that type of money is a
daunting task for a newly chartered environmental club.  At the end of last spring, we submitted a proposal for an award from the United States Green Building council
for their Innovative Sustainability Initiative category. Finding out that we will be given an honorable mention at
the USGBC’s Emerald Award Gala made us feel proud of everything we have
accomplished thus far. It felt as if this award set the stage for the future of
this project and there was no stopping us now! This journey has taught us a lot
in one year, but we are looking forward to taking the next big step and getting
the University’s approval to make this dream a reality. With this much
perseverance and manpower fueling this project, we are like a maglev train
traveling at 4,000 miles per hour on clean energy!
                                                RecognitionOur Project has received much acknowledgement by the professional sustainability community. One of our proudest achievements so far is the honorable mention we received from the United States Green Building Council, which was awarded to us at their New Jersey chapter gala in october.

As students, this cost comes as a great burden and we would be grateful of any help that you could offer. 




Itinerary
If all goes to plan, we should be departing from Liverpool, UK on the 9th of July and upon arrival at Johannesburg O.R. Tambo International Airport we will proceed to Kruger National Park where we will spend the first of our two-week conservation expedition.
Here, we will be conducting fieldwork and collecting data that will ultimately be used to:Quantify the impact of elephants around artificial and natural waterholes.Calculate carrying capacity of reserves for elephants.Monitor the distribution of large herbivores and predators.Complete annual surveys of winter bird community structure and density in areas of habitat with differing levels of elephant impact.


The second week, aptly dubbed ""Marine Week"", will have our group travelling to Sodwana Bay in Kwa Zulu Natal, South Africa and completing a PADI Open Water dive training course which involves a combination of theory lessons, confined water dives, and open water dives to gain an official SCUBA qualification.

<h3>A brief summary</h3>
<p>My name is Sebastian Cruft. I am the inventor of the HUMO™.  I'm retired now, but I worked for 35 years as a Director of a small family company. Although I was never trained as an engineer, I spent many years in a factory, specifying machinery and  adapting off-the-shelf machines to work to our purposes. I also learned how important it is that products:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">a. do something people really want, and</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">b. do it effectively and reliably.</p>
<p>For 30 years I have had progressive MS, and I'm now full-time in a wheelchair, with only one working hand. This is very frustrating, and prevents me from physically making anything. In the past, I often wondered whether I should give up the HUMO™ project - but I feel it is so close to success and has such great potential that I don't want to stop. </p>
<p>I have always felt that there is a gap in the market - a truly versatile and efficient form of human powered transport, which uses the strength in a human body more effectively to provide a simple, cheap, safe way to get around, with a bit of room for the things which are needed for ordinary life - shopping, a briefcase, a violin, a community nurse's bag for bandages, blood-testing etc...</p>
<p>We want to make the HUMO™ available as widely as possible by building a community of customers and partners to co-create and innovate, spreading HUMO™ ideas as far and wide as possible. We see endless potential uses around the world.</p>
<p>First, we need to build <strong>a new, lightweight, foldable prototype</strong> that will become our launchpad.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>HUMO™ prototypes have been built in the past and have successfully proved the principles behind the revolutionary crank design. However, they were made from 40mm box-section steel, and the lighter of the two weighed 80kg - <strong>that's eight times heavier than a standard bicycle</strong>.</p>
<p>This new prototype, based on a 21kg folding aluminium frame, will be <strong>much more portable</strong>, <strong>easier to secure</strong>, and <strong>faster</strong>, traveling at <strong>upwards of 25mph</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Our first priority is to build the aluminium prototype</strong>, which we estimate will cost $10,000 - we will regularly report back on progress through social media.</p>
<p>Additional funds will go towards:</p>
<p><strong>1. Developing the HUMO™ Community</strong></p>
<p>To maximise co-operation we want to develop a more interactive environment with forums, live chats and document sharing, so that all of our learning and developments can be shared for the benefit of all.</p>
<p><strong>2. Buil</strong><strong>ding an even lighter, faster plastic prototype</strong></p>
<p>With more funds, we will jump straight to a plastic prototype, for which we will need mould designs. This would be a bonus but is far from a necessity.</p>
<p><strong>3. Preparing CAD drawings of other products using the principles of the HUMO™ drive</strong>, such as 2-person, 4- and 5-person cars, light delivery vehicles, light-weight tractors and mowers, water-transporters, 2-driver ambulances etc. Your suggestions will be welcome, and, within our budget, we will design anything harmless which we feel is practical, sharing the designs on the community.</p>
<h3><strong>Perks</strong></h3>
<p>To thank you for your generosity I am offering some perks - ranging from my heartfelt thanks, to a unique one-off lifetime 50% discount on a commercially produced HUMO™. Our most generous funders will have the opportunity to come over to Devon in the UK, to see the prototype being tested and to be one of the very first people in the world to drive one.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Result</h3>
<p>The HUMO™ offers many significant benefits over both cars and bicycles, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the environmental benefits of pollution-free human powered transport</li>
<li>greatly reduced damage in an impact (due to lower weight and greater stability)</li>
<li>avoid parking costs (can be kept indoors like a bike) </li>
<li>great visibility from the upright riding position</li>
<li>additional stability from 4 wheels</li>
<li>protection from the elements (lightweight, high visibility weatherproof shell)</li>
<li>no need to dismount when stopped at a red light</li>
<li>significantly lower purchase price than a car</li>
<li>no car or road tax</li>
<li>low maintenance and insurance costs</li>
<li>you get fit using one</li>
<li>they are great fun!</li>
</ul>
<p>To maximise the success of the HUMO™ I have assembled a team of 'champions', all experts in their fields of Engineering, Management, IT and Marketing. The champions have helped me get the campaign off the ground, and will continue to be involved with the HUMO™ project as it evolves and expands.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The previous prototypes that I have developed (at my own cost) have been too heavy, but they have proved that this revolutionary crank system actually works. The most significant task now is to keep the prototype as light as possible; we are looking forward to sending you films of a HUMO™ cruising under human power at the sort of speeds (25mph+) which will be sufficient for everyday life.  </p>
<p>The first lightweight prototype will be built from aluminium. This is cheap to produce, environmentally sound and easy to fabricate. Excluding the cranks, the majority of the drive train and wheels will be provided by parts from off-the-shelf bicycles, keeping our costs as low as possible while maintaining accessibility.</p>
<p>It is hoped that this will produce a prototype that can form the blueprint for future development, the designs of which can be shared with partners and other innovators throughout the HUMO™ Community.</p>

</div></div>","A brief summary
My name is Sebastian Cruft. I am the inventor of the HUMO™.  I'm retired now, but I worked for 35 years as a Director of a small family company. Although I was never trained as an engineer, I spent many years in a factory, specifying machinery and  adapting off-the-shelf machines to work to our purposes. I also learned how important it is that products:
a. do something people really want, and
b. do it effectively and reliably.
For 30 years I have had progressive MS, and I'm now full-time in a wheelchair, with only one working hand. This is very frustrating, and prevents me from physically making anything. In the past, I often wondered whether I should give up the HUMO™ project - but I feel it is so close to success and has such great potential that I don't want to stop. 
I have always felt that there is a gap in the market - a truly versatile and efficient form of human powered transport, which uses the strength in a human body more effectively to provide a simple, cheap, safe way to get around, with a bit of room for the things which are needed for ordinary life - shopping, a briefcase, a violin, a community nurse's bag for bandages, blood-testing etc...
We want to make the HUMO™ available as widely as possible by building a community of customers and partners to co-create and innovate, spreading HUMO™ ideas as far and wide as possible. We see endless potential uses around the world.

<h3>Help <strong>bee the change</strong> plant the forage for pollinators in solar fields. </h3>
<p>Most solar fields are planted with grass or stone, we feel that this is a missed opportunity. <strong>bee the change </strong>places a diverse array of plantings in and around the solar field, which increases plant productivity within and beyond the field and supports downstream species who rely on that biodiversity, such as birds, fish, wildlife, and human beings.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our first field, installed in May 2016, is the equivalent in area to 3,624 homes with 12 X 6 pollinator gardens. And several more fields are under construction at this moment.</p>
<p>A survey of the pollinator population in our first year at the South Ridge field in Middlebury demonstrated 34 unique pollinator encounters in a<strong> </strong>15 minute period. One year later, surveying the same plots, we encountered <strong>174 unique pollinators in 15 minutes</strong>. That impact will <strong>increase the productivity of plants</strong> beyond the boundaries of the solar field and support downstream species who rely on that productivity- birds, fish, other wildlife and, of course, human beings.</p>

<p><strong>Let Us Introduce Ourselves</strong></p>
<p>The Concerned Professional Engineers (CPE) are a small group of professional engineers living in British Columbia, Canada.  Together we have many decades of experience in the design, construction and operation of large projects for the extraction and transportation of natural resources like coal and oil.</p>
<p>We share a deep concern for the environment and the future of this coast, this country and this planet.  With our backgrounds we are keenly aware of the inherent conflict between environmental protection and resource development.</p>
<p>We understand that we cannot end our dependence on resources tomorrow, and that it is important to propose practical, achievable solutions to these problems that strike an acceptable balance between economic development and risk to the environment.  We are not opposed to the development and export of natural resources, but we feel very strongly that these projects must be done in as safe and responsible manner as possible, with a full accounting of the risks and visibility to the public.</p>
<p>Our focus is that we want the public to know about the high risk decisions that were made by the federal government in approving the Kinder Morgan’s Trans-mountain Expansion Project.  This project will increase the tanker traffic in Burrard Inlet from 5 to 34 vessels per month.  This increase has not had a proper risk assessment on two counts;</p>
<ul>
<li>A risk analysis on collision with the existing bridges has not been done.</li>
<li>The 10% risk of a major spill of 8.25 million liters in 50 years has not been properly analyzed;<ul>
<li>The government has given no explanation as to why they’ve accepted this risk.</li>
<li>There is no evidence that this assessment has been peer reviewed and compared with other acceptable risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to spread awareness on what risk is and what risks are associated with this project.</p>
<p>The key is to reduce risk to acceptable levels.  The basis on which the federal government approved the expansion is 5 times the risk we accept for earthquakes and 20 times riskier that what we accept for new bridge construction.</p>
<p>The concerns we have were brought to the federal government and the National Energy Board (NEB), but were ignored.  We have tried to make a legal appeal to the courts, but have been turned down because we don’t have the status on an intervenor (denied to us by NEB).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Plan and How You Can Help!</strong></p>
<p>CPE is looking to raise $10,000 to assist in continuing efforts to press the federal government in reassessing the risks associated with the Kinder Morgan Expansion.  We will use these donations to support the CPE team and focus on the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>We wish to assist organizations who have brought an action to oppose the expansion in the Federal Appeal Court.</li>
<li>We wish to continue our dialogue with the owners of the Railway Bridge (CN) and the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge (Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure of BC).  The bridge owners are, at the present time, carrying out a risk analysis of collision with their bridges resulting from the increased tanker traffic.</li>
<li>We are working with the owners of the bridges to ensure that they are implementing proper risk analysis for the increased tanker traffic.  This would ensure that if the risks are too high (above those deemed acceptable for other projects), that the bridge owners are doing what needs to be done to mitigate the higher risks.</li>
<li>CPE is writing up a work plan for the engineers assigned to the task of deciding the safety of the Second Narrows Bridges, and will take the work plan to the owners’ engineers responsible for the bridges.</li>
<li>CPE feels the only way to ensure that this job is done properly is to see that the bridge owners carry out a proper risk analysis and be open and transparent about it.</li>
<li>We will continue to be in contact and work with organizations concerned with the safety of the project by sharing our engineering expertise.</li>
<li>We need your help to spread the message of the actions we are taking to raise public awareness and share through social media.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact, Risks, &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Evidence shows that changing the port location is the best way to minimize risk to both people and to the environment.  Unfortunately, cost and time for approvals have gotten in the way of making the safest location decision. The federal Department of Fisheries and the Minister of Environment (in 1987) rated the Eastern Burrard Inlet as the riskiest (unsafest) location from which to ship petroleum products.  Roberts Bank (Deltaport) is many times safer than the Eastern Burrard Inlet. We also think that our federal government should make the effort to provide a terminal and export route that are as safe as possible.  The studies that were done in 1987 showed the safest port location to be Port Simpson, where sailing time from the port to the open ocean is only a half an hour (30 km N of Prince Rupert).  </p>
<p>It is essential that the public understand the risks associated with the current decision, how to minimize these risks, and that the information needs to be passed on and enforced by the government to do a proper risk assessment before approving this or other similar projects.</p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to get this message out to the public, to support the intervenors who have status (who are able to legally challenge the federal government's decision), and to support the continuing costs in dialoguing with the owners of the bridges to fulfill their responsibility to provide the maximum protection possible for their bridges.</p>
<p>In conclusion, with your donations, CPE plans;</p>
<ul>
<li>to assist those who are publicly campaigning against this decision,</li>
<li>provide them with public arguments on the high risks, and work to educate the public that if there were an incident with the bridges and spilled oil, the public will end up paying the price to clean up the spill.</li>
<li>create a work plan to submit to the Second Narrows Bridge owners, to use as a standard for a safe risk assessment, and what steps should occur to assure safety should a tanker hit one or both bridges in an accident.</li>
<li>continue to circulate information and educate the public on the safety concerns for the environment that this expansion will imply.</li>
</ul> <p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help.  Please pass this campaign onto your friends, colleagues, and family to spread the word and help create a Safer BC.</p>
