<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>We are <b><i>6 Dancers on a Mission</i></b>: a small group of dancers in NYC looking to make an impact on a cause we care about.  We are using our skills as dancers to promote awareness and raise funds for global girls' education initiatives, beginning with <b>""Do it in a Dress,""</b> a <b>One Girl</b> charity initiative providing scholarships to girls in Sierra Leone.   </p>
<p>We believe as dancers that arts have the power to awaken people, to impassion them and help them experience new things.  We hope to do just that with our first dance drama, <i><b>SPIRIT: A Celebration of Women Everywhere</b></i>.  Proceeds from both our performances will be donated to <b>Do it in a Dress</b>. Your donations will cover our costs up front so that we can donate more to the organization.  The more costs we cover up front, the more girls we can send to school this year!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $2,500 total to cover our production costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,000 for our first theater rental, $300 for the second.</li>
<li>$520 for rehearsal space.</li>
<li>$130 for our event insurance.</li>
<li>$150 for costumes.</li>
<li>$100 for royalties (music).</li>
<li>$100 for marketing/media.</li>
<li>$100 for promotional materials (programs, posters, etc...)</li>
<li>$100 for lighting/sound person/stage manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't meet our goal, we are prepared to cover these costs ourselves from ticket sale proceeds.  However, our hope is to be able to donate most if not all of that money to <i>Do it in a Dress.  </i></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

<ul>
<li>It only takes $300 to give a girl in Sierra Leone access to education for an entire year.  </li>
<li>Last year, Laura (our choreographer) raised $350 simply by putting a donation jar out after one of her dance performances with Vissi Dance Theater.  </li>

Hi there!
We are 6 Dancers on a Mission: a small group of dancers in NYC looking to make an impact on a cause we care about.  We are using our skills as dancers to promote awareness and raise funds for global girls' education initiatives, beginning with ""Do it in a Dress,"" a One Girl charity initiative providing scholarships to girls in Sierra Leone.   
We believe as dancers that arts have the power to awaken people, to impassion them and help them experience new things.  We hope to do just that with our first dance drama, SPIRIT: A Celebration of Women Everywhere.  Proceeds from both our performances will be donated to Do it in a Dress. Your donations will cover our costs up front so that we can donate more to the organization.  The more costs we cover up front, the more girls we can send to school this year!


What We Need & What You Get
We need $2,500 total to cover our production costs:

$1,000 for our first theater rental, $300 for the second.
$520 for rehearsal space.
$130 for our event insurance.
$150 for costumes.
$100 for royalties (music).
$100 for marketing/media.
$100 for promotional materials (programs, posters, etc...)
$100 for lighting/sound person/stage manager.

If we don't meet our goal, we are prepared to cover these costs ourselves from ticket sale proceeds.  However, our hope is to be able to donate most if not all of that money to Do it in a Dress.  


The Impact
“You educate a man; you educate a man. You educate a woman; you educate a generation.” -Brigham Young

It only takes $300 to give a girl in Sierra Leone access to education for an entire year.  
Last year, Laura (our choreographer) raised $350 simply by putting a donation jar out after one of her dance performances with Vissi Dance Theater.  
This year, we want to send as many girls to school as possible.  Your donations will help us do that!



Other Ways You Can Help

<p>Not much, how are you? So what's the deal with the play <em>Rock</em>? Well, first and foremost, it's for you. And us. We're making the kind of theatre we like to see; theatre that speaks to our interests as young Canadian professionals that dig HBO and Apatow films. Your evening should be entertaining, arousing, challenging, and fun. Above all else, that's what we're working to bring you.</p>
<p><em>Rock</em> is a pitch black comedy about love, friendship, and how far you would go to protect someone you care about who has recently started bludgeoning people to death with rocks. It's a new Canadian play from the twisted mind of Kat Sandler (writer/director of <em>LOVESEXMONEY, Help Yourself</em>, and <em>Delicacy</em>) and it's pretty neat.  </p>
<p>Basically, your roomate came home with the body of a guy he clubbed to death with a rock. What do you do? (He wants to play N64 and drink beer.)  We think you'll like it.</p>
<p><strong>YES. THIS! HAVE SOME LOOT!</strong></p>
<p>Sound good? We hope so. We would love to have your support, but more importantly, your time and support matter THIIIIISSSSS MUCH (I'm holding out my arms.  You can't see it, but trust me it's quite impressive) and we want to offer you some nifty loot for believing in us and our work. But before we get to that, here's the talented, passionate people your cash will be going towards paying:</p>

<p><strong>I LIKE ALL THOSE PEOPLE!  SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!</strong></p>

<p>-The Cast and Crew of ROCK.  And Viewers Like You! *Rainbow*</p>
<p>PS: And once again, thanks.  Your interest and support are helping to usher in the next generation of theatre, for people like you, by people like you.  There isn't enough room in an Indiegogo window to express how much that means to us and we hope every actor, script, set, and show delivers above and beyond what you expect.  You deserve the best and we want to bring it to you.</p></div>","WHAT UP?

<h2>We Need Your Help </h2>
<p><br/>This summer, <strong>Project Rushmore Theatre Company </strong>bursts onto the New York scene with its debut productions: </p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><big><strong>VALHALLA</strong></big></p>
<p align=""center""><big>by Paul Rudnick</big></p>
<p> </p>

<p align=""center""><big>by Jane Anderson</big> </p>
<p align=""center""><em><big>(a New York premiere)</big></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The productions will feature—and be directed by—members of the company. Though written by two radically different playwrights, both plays further the company's artistic mission of exploring the American spirit. They will be presented on a rotating repertory schedule, July 16 through August 4, at the ArcLight Theatre. The company is excited, energized, and ready to go! </p>
<p>But we need your help.... <strong>Won't you join us in our quest, by making a contribution? </strong>No amount is too small, or too great! By giving, you will aid a group of dedicated artists in sharing their work. You'll give exposure to two fine American playwrights and their brilliantly crafted plays. And you'll enable audiences to explore the timeless themes of identity, nonconformity, true beauty, aging, loss, compassion, love, regret, and the wonders of living and dying in America.</p>
<p>Your gift will also <strong>help launch a new theatre company</strong> founded on the repertory model, now rare in New York City, in which company members work together frequently, in an effort to produce a richer form of theatre. The depth of the work derives in part from the artists' deep understanding of each other.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Plays</h3>
<p>In Paul Rudnick's VALHALLA, both King Ludwig of Bavaria and James Avery of Texas spend their lives in search of beauty. Six actors alternate between the mid-nineteenth and twentieth centuries, bringing to life a grand comedy of epic scope.</p>
<p>In Jane Anderson's THE QUALITY OF LIFE, when Dinah and her husband visit a dying cousin, they are surprised by his end-of-life plans—and those of his wife. Anderson's play explores issues surrounding family and death, including how we prepare for, and process, loss. Her remarkable play unfolds with provocative intellect and unexpected humor. This will be the New York City premiere of Anderson’s play. She has won an Emmy and a WGA Award for her television writing, which includes <em>Normal</em>, an HBO adaptation of her play <em>Looking for Normal</em>. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Background </h3>
<p>For the past three years, Project Rushmore has presented a series of two staged readings every month, focusing in large part on plays by emerging American playwrights. Along the way, <strong>the company has given back to the community</strong>, as well—by presenting two readings specifically in celebration of Gay Pride Week, and also by producing a special benefit performance whose proceeds sponsored three cobblestones at the new National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum at the World Trade Center. Now, the company is primed to tackle our next step—presenting fully staged, fully realized productions that further our artistic mission: to explore the American Spirit.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where Your Contribution Goes</h3>
<p>There are countless expenses inherent in producing live theatre, and the economics of doing so mean that ticket sales don't come close to covering costs. The company needs $9,650, in order to make our dream come true. And with generous support from champions like you, Project Rushmore can meet this goal, allowing our projects to soar. </p>
<p>Your donation will help the company pay for such things as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theater Rental</li>
<li>Licensing Fees</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Scenery</li>
<li>Props</li>
<li>Lighting</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Programs</li>

Can we sing opera as if we are in the shower alone and then fully embody the presence of a lizard?

<p><strong>Touchstone Theatre</strong> has been an innovative West Coast home of new Canadian theatre for over 35 years.  We are known for our excellence and innovation. We are passionate about giving life to new plays and nurturing the work of playwrights.</p>
<p>Touchstone’s <strong>Flying Start</strong> program was launched in 2008 in association with Playwrights Theatre Centre as a new initiative to help stem the drain of talent from the field of playwriting. Playwrights  face an uphill battle in trying to sell their scripts to theatre companies, while trying to master the enormous difficulties of writing for the stage. While development opportunities abound, trying to get that first professional production can be enormously difficult.  Both Touchstone and the PTC feel that, while development is essential, playwrights can only truly mature with the sterling lessons a production offers.</p>
<p>Enter <strong>Flying Start</strong>.  The two year cycle begins with a public call for new scripts from playwrights who have yet to have a play professionally produced.  The first phase is focused on development of the script through dramaturgy and workshops with professional actors. The second phase is spent gearing up for and then realizing a full scale production using professional actors and designers.</p>
<h3>Flying Start 2012: <em>Shelter from the Storm</em>
</h3>
<p>The 2012 Flying Start production is <strong><em>Shelter from the Storm</em></strong> by Peter Boychuk. This is the third play to be mentored and produced through Flying Start. <em><strong>Shelter</strong> </em>is the story of Rick, one of thousands of young men who escaped the Vietnam draft and found refuge in Canada. When he gives shelter to a traumatized young American soldier who has deserted his post in Iraq, Rick begins to understand how much Canada has changed in forty years. Set in the beach, forest and surf culture of Tofino, BC, <strong><em>Shelter from the Storm</em></strong> is a play about love and loss that questions our notions of courage and cowardice. The script has already been awarded Second Prize in the 2011 Uprising National Playwriting Competition.</p>
<h3>The Playwright</h3>
<p>The playwright, Peter Boychuk, has just completed his MFA at U. Vic, under the mentorship of Governor General’s Award-winning playwright Joan MacLeod. Peter has already received numerous awards for his one-act plays. <em>Afterglow </em>has been published in the anthology <em>Two Hands Clapping</em> and has been produced in schools and universities across the country; <em>Fortunate Son</em> won the Stanley Mills Purchase Prize, Honourable Mention in the Canadian National Playwriting Competition and Best of the Fest at ACToberfest 2007; <em>Chainmail Bikini</em> premiered at the Calgary Fringe. In recognition of his shorter works, The Vancouver Sun has called Peter <strong> “a rising young talent”</strong>.  <em>Shelter from the Storm</em> is his first full length play. This is an extraordinary opportunity for Peter. We want to give his work the best chance to succeed.</p>
<h3>The Creative Team</h3>
<p>A great creative team is on board: <strong>Peter Hall, Kyle Jespersen</strong> and recent Studio 58 grad <strong>Lindsay Winch</strong> will perform. The set design is by <strong>Pam Johnson</strong>; lighting by <strong>Adrian Muir</strong>; costumes by <strong>Farnaz Khaki-Sadigh</strong>; and sound by <strong>Jeff McMahan</strong>. <strong>Katrina Dunn</strong> will direct. Martin Kinch is the dramaturge.</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Touchstone’s early years were marked by its association with some of the most important Canadian playwrights of the 80’s and 90’s – Judith Thompson, Brad Fraser, Joan McLeod, John Murrell, Sally Clark, Byden MacDonald and Michel Marc Bouchard. The company has also been an important launch pad for West Coast playwrights such as David King, John Lazarus, Peter Elliott Weiss, Dennis Foon, Peter Anderson and Gordon Armstrong.  In more recent years Touchstone has given important productions to local playwrights Shawn Macdonald, Carmen Aguirre, Michael Lewis MacLennan, Janet Munsil, Ami Gladstone, as well as continuing to produce some of Canada’s national stars: Michael Healey, Jason Sherman, Vern Thiessen, Morwyn Brebner, and Daniel MacIvor. </p>
<p>The opportunity that Flying Start offers – a first professional production for an important new voice in Canadian playwriting – is desperately needed.  Touchstone and its partners plan to continue the program in the hopes that it will seed a new generation of thriving local playwrights. </p>

<h2><strong>Lost in Staten Island, More Tales of Modern Living.</strong></h2>
<p>This spring brings the latest play and songs in the Modern Living series back to the Club at La MaMa as the final entry of their 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary season. </p>
<p>Began in 2006 as a way to tell stories in a theatrical form, these are true stories about real people who struggle with the ordinary and extraordinary things we call life.  In our last edition Post Modern Living we told the story of my mom Joy, and what happened when she found a lump in her breast that turned out to be cancer. </p>
<p>In Lost in Staten Island, actress Wendy Merritt is back as Joy, and she is joined by her son, the performance artist at the center of the series Mitch (played by author Richard Sheinmel); Alternately humorous and heartfelt, they spend the day together and just like the title says – they get lost in Staten Island.  Mick Hilgers; Catherine Porter; and Chris Orbach is back with his guitar, both singing and playing Mitch’s brother Robby – as he leads our band the All Star Sprit Guides in new music and songs by Clay Zambo.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Thanks for checking us out – we are raising funds for our next production.  We play in the Club at La MaMa ETC, a well-known theater at 74a East Fourth Street, in New York City’s East Village.  We go into rehearsal the second week in May and have our first performance June 15<sup>th</sup>. </p>

<p>There are some fun incentives for your donation – <strong>the top donor gets written into the show</strong>… that’s right – your name, or a loved one’s name, or your pet’s name will be part of this play. (It comes with a copy of the script autographed by the authors and cast.) This incentive will also go to the first three people to donate at the $5000 level. </p>
<p>Perks $500 and above include <strong>tickets to gala night</strong>, donate more and we will save a café table down front.  At $750 – you will receive a very unique thank you – Composer Lyricist Clay Zambo will give you <strong>an autographed hand written page out of his score.</strong> </p>

<p>We are The OG Crew aka The Original Gentlemen, an all male dance crew from Toronto, Ontario. We focus on crowd entertainment by bringing diverse choreography and a masculine flavour. </p>
<p>We have qualified to compete and represent Canada at the World Street Dance Championships in Blackpool, England. There will be many other crews representing for their respective countries and we want to make sure that Canada has a crew to call their own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>What We Need</em></strong></p>
<p>We are looking to raise $10,000, which is a portion of what we are going to need to be able to go. Any amount we recieve will help us get a step closer to going, so if we do not reach our intended goal, we are still hoping that with what we raise through here and from our other events that we will have enough to go.</p>
<p>If in the end we still don't have enough to go to England we are planning on traveling to the U.S. and compete over there. So either way we will be using the money to represent Canada outside of the country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>The Impact</em></strong></p>
<p>Even though we are looking to represent Canada overseas, in the end we are really trying to represent for dance as an art form. We have always kept the crowd's entertainment in mind when we have a performance, because we want them to leave satisfied.

<p><strong><em>Other Ways You Can Help</em></strong></p>
<p>We are trying to do as much other fundraising as possible by hosting workshops where people can come and learn from us.

We are also hosting parties where people can have a good time while remaining in a classy environment, afterall we are gentlemen.</p>
<p>If you can't make a donation, it would be great if you could pass this along to anybody you may know that would be willing to help us out.</p></div>","Short Summary
We are The OG Crew aka The Original Gentlemen, an all male dance crew from Toronto, Ontario. We focus on crowd entertainment by bringing diverse choreography and a masculine flavour. 
We have qualified to compete and represent Canada at the World Street Dance Championships in Blackpool, England. There will be many other crews representing for their respective countries and we want to make sure that Canada has a crew to call their own.
 
What We Need
We are looking to raise $10,000, which is a portion of what we are going to need to be able to go. Any amount we recieve will help us get a step closer to going, so if we do not reach our intended goal, we are still hoping that with what we raise through here and from our other events that we will have enough to go.
If in the end we still don't have enough to go to England we are planning on traveling to the U.S. and compete over there. So either way we will be using the money to represent Canada outside of the country.
 
The Impact
Even though we are looking to represent Canada overseas, in the end we are really trying to represent for dance as an art form. We have always kept the crowd's entertainment in mind when we have a performance, because we want them to leave satisfied. We have been recognised as a very crowd pleasing dance crew and we have sworn to live by our name.. Original Gentlemen.

<p>If you've ever been to OmCulture, whether it was for dancing, yoga,<br/>concerts, or community events, you've made use of our floor. But<br/>recently we've noticed the floor is splintering in places, making it<br/>unsafe to dance and play on. It's time to fix the floor, and we're<br/>asking the community to come together to help improve our space!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What's it going to cost?</p>
<p>We want to use Kempas for our new floor, a south east Asian hardwood<br/>that will be durable, attractive, and most importantly, quick to<br/>install. The Om Culture floor is a whopping 3,500 sq ft, and Kempas<br/>costs $2.75/sq ft plus tax. We also have to install an underlayment,<br/>which costs $0.40/sq ft. We will save some money by using volunteers<br/>to assist in laying the floor, however we do need to hire a<br/>professional to do the edging.</p>
<p>In sum:<br/>$2.75 (the floor) * 3,500= $9,625<br/>$0.40 (the underlayment) * 3,500= $1,400<br/>Professional to install the edges: $2,000</p>
<p>Total Cost = $13,025</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other Ways you can Help:</p>
<p>Maybe money is tight but you still want to contribute? Or you just like working with your hands? To save on cost we will be installing the new floor ourselves. That means we need help (both skilled and unskilled labor) in order to make this project happen.</p>
<p>A couple hours of your time will help build something great! Send an email to saveourfeet@gmail.com to get on the volunteer crew or find out more.</p></div>","Why?

<h2>The Plays</h2>
<p align=""center""><strong>Homeland</strong><em> </em>by Michael Parsons, directed by Kayla Prata</p>
<p>Where does a mistake end and treason begin?  This is the question haunting Reyes, a Marine Corps veteran and recluse who is content to live out her days in a one-bedroom apartment.  Her only contact with the outside world is Ruth, a volunteer for an outreach program for invalids.  Ruth has secrets of her own, and an agenda as deep as her Southern accent.  As both women reach out to each other — Ruth willingly, Reyes grudgingly — their pasts begin to creep into their private world and threaten to destroy them both.  Trust becomes the most precious commodity, and ideas of loyalty and honor come to the forefront in this one-set play.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>not Jenny</strong> by MJ Halberstadt, directed by Hondo Weiss-Richmond</p>
<p>After thirteen years of estrangement, Not Jenny, a self-made travel writer, returns to her childhood home after learning her twin sister Jenny was paralyzed from the waist down in a car accident which also killed their mother. She stumbles into more sensitive territory than she bargained for as she attempts to reconcile the family’s difficult history, particularly when their younger brother Jimmy reopens old wounds and stands in the way of her ability to make amends. As Jenny unravels and Jimmy tempts Not Jenny with the prospect of escaping, Not Jenny’s compassion for both of her siblings is pushed to the limit.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Scene 8 </strong>by Rick Park, directed by Grant MacDermott</p>
<p>Mace wants nothing more in life than to become a famous actress. Her whole life has been filled with classes and lessons and auditions, leading her to what could be her big break: an audition for a show that is going to New York. At the audition, Mace nails it, until her twin brother Dixon interrupts her. To everyone’s surprise, Dixon is asked to audition as well, and when both are cast, everyone, including Mace’s gay roommate Seb, are ecstatic, until it comes to light that the brother and sister have been cast as husband and wife in a play that includes and explicit sex scene between them. When neither sibling will back down, they decide to get drunk and “go for it”. But while the liquor loosens them up, it also allows old secrets to bubble to the surface, leaving Mace, Dixon and Seb reeling by the end of the night.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Shoe Baby</strong> by Jaclyn Villano, directed by Jacob Titus</p>
<p>Zoe and Ethan Barnes are desperate to have a baby.  After their third miscarriage, Zoe is distraught and finds little comfort in anything besides a small stuffed bear named Sheldon.  The couple’s struggles lead them to Dr. Ava Maria Garza, a world-class fertility specialist who hates kids as much as she loves shoes.  When Dr. Garza’s treatment plan wreaks havoc on Zoe (and her marriage), Sheldon the Bear comes to the rescue… and comes to life as the son Zoe has always wanted.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
We are the seventeen second-year actors at the American Repertory Theater/Moscow Art Theater School Institute for Advanced Theater Training at Harvard University: international, vibrant, diverse, and dedicated, we have spent the last two years creating a theatrical ensemble that can sing, dance, entertain audiences of all ages, recite Shakespeare, charm with Chekhov, and yes, even say a few Russian words along the way. The training that we have received is top-notch, and we are fortunate to be connected with two major cultural institutions--the American Repertory Theater and the Moscow Art Theater. The union of between the Institute and the Moscow Art Theater (MXAT) has created a historic program that provides unparalleled opportunities for training and growth, making our Institute's program one of the top ten graduate theater programs in the United States.
<p>The two-year Institute curriculum combines study in Cambridge, Massachusetts with a three-month residency at the Moscow Art Theater. We began our training in mid-July in Cambridge and spent the spring of our first year in Moscow, and returned to Cambridge for the fall and spring of our second year. In Moscow, we take classes with prominent members and actors of the Russian theater community, as well as join the spring repertory of the theater with our own production. In Cambridge, we play an integral role in the A.R.T. community, working alongside the professional acting company and guest artists in both rehearsals and the classroom. Throughout this season, we have had the opportunity to perform in two ART mainstage productions, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Snow Queen</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">As You Like It</span>.</p>
<p>The wide range of courses given by the international faculty gives us unique preparation for the multi-faceted demands of the professional theater. The Institute program simultaneously respects the great traditions of the past and encourages the development of new ideas and forms of expression. Our program is rigorous and requires complete dedication and commitment to honing our skills as performers. We are in classes and rehearsals thirteen hours a day, six days a week.</p>
<p>Some of the classes we take:</p>
<p>Russian Acting (Etude work and ensemble building)</p>
<p>Russian movement</p>
<p>Voice</p>
<p>Shakespeare</p>
<p>Speech</p>

He has worked in theatre professionally in its various forms for over three years, before re-acquainting his love for horror. He has worked in various Scare Attractions throughout the UK. He enjoys creating and developing the Mazes alongside Seb, but loves bringing in his performance experience to train the actors as well as scare the guests himself. He is currently dedicating most of his time to the company. He has just finished writing KSA's latest play (Buried), which will be touring the UK from 2012.
Seb Blaber(Designer/Producer)A trained theatre technician. Seb has worked professionally in London for over three years, covering many disciplines in the technical world. He is currently the lighting designer for 'Theatre of the Damned'. Only two years ago Seb was scared of anything and everything; but as is the 'business' he followed where the work was; and now his whole life revolvesaround horror. He loves designing scare attractions. He takes what he has learnt throughout his years as a theatre technician to produce technically brilliant visuals and sound for the mazes. He loves creating something that he knows will make guests jump on every corner.
What are Scare Attractions?Scare attractions are something that started in the USA and are known asHaunted Attractions. They are terrifying  theatrical experiences in whichguests move through themed environments. These are created for the sole purposeof taking the guests out of their comfort zones. They use theatrical lighting,sound and special effects; add to this the professionally trained 'ScareActors' and it will create a truly hair-raising experience.
What you can expect within a maze?Of course without giving away too many surprises: guests will walk throughthe maze in small groups, encountering various 'Horror themes'. The mazes willusually be in almost complete darkness, immediately increasing the feeling ofanticipation and decreasing the feeling of comfort. They will be confronted bytalented 'Scare Actors' who enjoy nothing more than making you feel uneasy.They will appear in the darkness in the blink of an eye, and seemingly appearto vanish just as quickly. Add the theatrical lighting, sound and specialeffects, and you are guaranteed a disorientating yet brilliantly miserabletime.

<h3><strong>What is The TRUF?</strong></h3>
<p>We are a theater company with a mission:  to share stories among people, with a focus on bridging the generations.  </p>
<p>We produce two shows at a time in repertory, an ""adult"" show and a ""children's"" show, both centered around one theme.  With your help, we're hoping to pair Frank McGuiness's <em>Someone Who'll Watch Over Me </em>with a brand new commission by the talented EJC Calvert that is based off the tales of Scheherazade, <em>Sarazad and the Monster King</em>.  The two share a theme of...you guessed it, storytelling.</p>
<p>Throughout history, sharing our stories has been a means of survival. Just as the three prisoners of war in <em>Someone</em> share their stories with each other to stave off insanity, Sarazad lives through her stories to escape from and eventually learn to face a tough reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where can one find the TRUF?</strong></h3>
<p>The TRUF can be found sharing stories among people, countries, and generations.  </p>
<p>Oh. You mean literally? Well then, in this particular instance, we can be found at the Canal Park Playhouse in New York City, gearing up for our productions of <em>Someone Who'll Watch Over Me</em> and <em>Sarazad and the Monster King</em>.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>Why does the TRUF even matter these days?</strong> </h3>
<p>We believe that truth grows from a seed of trust, and trust comes from sharing our stories. In our rapidly changing world, our ability to effectively communicate with those of a different generation has atrophied to a state of disrepair.  Through effectively engaging audiences young and old in the simplest and most direct form of entertainment, storytelling, we can begin to bridge the gap...</p>

<h3><strong>Nothing in NYC is free. Ain't that The TRUF? </strong></h3>
<p>We need your help to raise $8,000 so that we can bring these dreams to life. Your generosity will help us to pay for everything from the beautiful space at The Canal Park Playhouse to the very rights required to use our brilliant playwrights' words. </p>
<p>With each donation level, not only are you thanked with everything from our undying devotion to VIP Behind the Scenes Access, but you walk away knowing that you are  responsible for sponsoring a very specific aspect of this process.</p>
<p>Our hope is to reach 1,000 people willing to ""don8"" just $8 to our campaign, so please pass this along to anyone and everyone you can. From your grandmother to your barber, we'd love to share our story with them. Strength in numbers, my friend. </p>

My name is Art Shulman. I'm
planning to produce a play I've written called NOT ONE MORE FOOT OF LAND!  It will be performed at the Secret Rose Theater in the Los
Angeles area. 
Kristina Lloyd is the Director, an award winning stage and film
director.
 

The play opens in February,
 and we'd love you to be a part of it.


 NOT ONE MORE FOOT OF
LAND!  follows the life of the most
controversial Cherokee Indian who ever lived, a man still considered a traitor
by many in his tribe, but a savior by others. 


 His name was Major Ridge,
and he lived through one of the most shameful episodes in our nation's history, 
 an event called The Trail of Tears, in which the United States government forced
the Cherokee tribe to move from their ancestral lands in the South to west of
the Mississippi.  


 Imagine that! A whole
tribe, thousands of people, not allowed to stay in their homes and on their
land, but evicted through military force. It actually happened, in the
mid-1800's. Thousands of Cherokee perished on this long and often wintry journey.


 We've lined up some terrific actors, including many fine Native-American
actors, and we intend to
put up a first class production that will run for 8 weeks and hopefully will
gain attention because it covers how our nation, at one point in its past,
dealt with a minority group that was ""inconvenient"" to the majority population.


 So, please support our
production of NOT ONE MORE FOOT OF LAND!.


  It is gonna be a great show!


 

The Impact
This is an important story we are telling. It is based on a life of the most controversial Cherokee who ever lived.  It describes how he was involved in a shameless episode in out nation's history -- the forced removal of Native-Americans from the land they'd lived on for centuries to other land a thousand miles away.

What We Need & What You Get
NOT ONE MORE FOOT OF LAND! is expensive to produce. It is costly to rent a theater and rehearsal space (about $10,000), to pay actors and a crew even small amounts ($3,000), build a set ($1,500), provide costumes ($1,000), advertise the show ($2,000), and so on. So, the project can use your financial support.

We can provide you with some rewards based on your contribution. For example:

If you donate $10 or more, we'll mention you in our program.

If you donate $20 or more, we'll do that, and send you a signed copy of the program.

If you donate $50 or more we'll do all that, and email you a pdf of the script.

If you donate $100 or more, we'll do all that, and invite you to attend a rehearsal, and give you a complimentary VIP ticket to the performance.

Other Ways You Can Help
In addition to donating to our production you can help us by publicizing our project. If you think our project deserves support so may you friends, family, and associates.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

and in production style. We seek to produce both new and classic plays that ask
exhaustive and probing questions about the society we live in and the function

answers to. We believe that exploring contemporary experience through direct,
honest, and often irreverent storytelling can open live theatre to new and
diverse audiences. Whenever possible, we produce in non-traditional venues and
areas that are not already saturated with live performance, thus creating
opportunities for interaction with new communities. </span></p>

Story
7
Towers began in 2010 as a collaboration between an actor and a dramaturg, both
interested in the basic relationship between text, performer, and audience. Placing
a particular emphasis on honest communication, we value fundamental methods of
storytelling over expensive spectacle. 
 
7 Towers
is dedicated to making theatre that challenges the status quo, both in content
and in production style. We seek to produce both new and classic plays that ask
exhaustive and probing questions about the society we live in and the function
of art within it. We are not interested in asking questions we already know the
answers to. We believe that exploring contemporary experience through direct,
honest, and often irreverent storytelling can open live theatre to new and
diverse audiences. Whenever possible, we produce in non-traditional venues and
areas that are not already saturated with live performance, thus creating
opportunities for interaction with new communities. 
 
We are
motivated by what Martha Graham describes as a “queer, divine dissatisfaction,
a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us more alive.” Our
fundamental vision is of a theatrical process that searches for precise and
deep truth, deeper than what the average person, or even the average artist
will accept as sufficient.
 
7
Towers is a sponsored project of Austin Creative Alliance, a non-profit arts
service organization. 
 
The
Project
Our
first full season kicks off with a production of Lanford Wilson’s Burn This, December 2-18. The play is an often funny, often
heartbreaking look into the human soul after a tragic loss. It deals with the
aftermath of a dancer’s death for his roommate, a struggling New York
choreographer, and his brother, a hard-edged restaurant manager from New
Jersey. Burn This is a play that
speaks to the realities of living in a less than ideal world, and finding
moments of beauty within it. It’s about the artist’s place within the
community. To that end, we’re producing Burn This in the City View Terrace at Ballet Austin. This
non-traditional space allows us connection to the larger Austin arts community
as well as to the downtown business community that surrounds both our
production space and the lives of the characters in the play.

<p><b>The Dance Begins... </b></p>
<p>Zdravo! Bonjour! Mwaramutse! Hello! </p>
<p>I’m Tessa Adzemovic and I recently graduated from the University of
Michigan. </p>
<p>I have been dancing since I was five years old. At the U of M, I was the
co-president of Salto Dance Company, a student-run and funded lyrical and
ballet dance group. </p>
<p>Every year, Salto donates 50% of its show’s proceeds to a non-profit,
and this year we donated to the Rebecca Davis Dance Company, whose mission is
to use dance to advance the lives of children in post ethnic conflict and developing
countries.  </p>
<p>In June I travelled to Rwanda with RDDC,
and taught dance to former street boys. There I saw the potential for dance to change
student’s lives. One of the boys, Moise, told me his story. </p>
<p><b>The
General </b></p>
<p> <i>Moise left his father’s
home because his stepmother physically abused him. In search of a birth mother
he had never known, he lived on the streets for a year, sleeping underneath
highways and scrounging for food. </i></p>
<p><i>The other
kids called Moise “The General.” He had been chief of a street gang: charged
with controlling the younger kids and their drug trade. When he arrived to
Kigali, his mother refused to take him in. Devastated, Moise, escorted by the
police, was taken to the re-integration center where I taught dance. </i></p>
<p><i>Moise was
warm and generous, sharing his story candidly. Dance has transformed his life.
He is now disciplined and motivated, and knows that if he works hard, he may
someday go to school. </i></p>
<p><i>In talking
to Moise, I realized the harsh reality of a child growing up in a post-genocide
society. </i></p>
<p><b>Why do I
need your financial support? </b></p>
<p>To create a dance program in Mostar, Bosnia an ethnically divided town,
to help students like Moise, but in Eastern Europe. Mostar is split between
East and West, with Bosnians living on the East side and Croatians living on
the West. </p>
<p>In October, I will be part of a
dance teacher training program, along with two Rwandan teachers, two Ukrainian
teachers, and another American teacher. Starting in November, I will start to
implement my own project. </p>
<p><b>The money donated will go to: </b></p>

<p>Dance has been linked with culture and humanity for centuries. It
evokes many moods and emotions, expressing values that can bind communities
together. Dance and the arts in general have a role to play in international
reconciliation. </p>
<p>I really appreciate your support and I cannot wait to update you on my
progress bridging the youth of Mostar. Please get the word out and share my

<h3>The Monongalia Arts Center's summer production of John Logan's <i>RED </i>will compete at the West Virginia Theatre Association's Community Theatre Festival on Saturday, November 8th</h3> <p>Co-directed by and co-starring Morgantown directors/actors <b>David Beach</b> and <b>Shenendoah Thompson</b>, John Logan's Tony-award winning play, <b><i>RED</i></b>, follows the artist Mark Rothko and his assistant, Ken, as they prepare the murals for the Four Seasons Restaurant in New York City in the late 1950s. <br/></p>
<p>The original production ran in July, and the MAC invited the production to be entered into the WV Theatre Association's Community Theatre Festival. The Festival's winning production will represent West Virginia at the Southeastern Theatre Conference's Community Theatre Festival in March 2015.<br/></p>
<p>This year's festival is close-by in Bridgeport, but taking the production on the road requires additional funding, not supported by ticket sales. <br/></p>
<p>Here's where you can help! <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>To attend the West Virginia Community Theatre Festival will cost the MAC $600. (If it takes first place, attending the Southeastern Theatre Conference Festival will cost approximately $3,000, but we'll cross that bridge if we get there!) As a non-profit center, we rely on grants and donations to support the Center.<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Expenses include the following: rights to perform the play; WVTA registration; transportation for cast, crew and set; additional props (such as canvas and paints). </li> <li>Those who can help us achieve our goal will be invited to attend an open rehearsal of the production on Friday, November 7th, the night before competition, at the MAC. Following the rehearsal, you'll have a chance to meet and talk with the cast and crew.<br/>
</li> <li>If we don't reach our total campaign goal, all funds will go towards expenses.</li>
<li>If we exceed our total campaign goal, excess funds will be earmarked for future MACplayers productions.<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Community theatre is alive and well in West Virginia, and the MACplayers is just one of several community theatres in Morgantown that offer performances of cutting-edge works like <i>Red</i>. Recognition on the state level and the regional level helps elevate the performing arts in our community!</p>

This year's festival is close-by in Bridgeport, but taking the production on the road requires additional funding, not supported by ticket sales. 
Here's where you can help! 
  What We Need & What You Get To attend the West Virginia Community Theatre Festival will cost the MAC $600. (If it takes first place, attending the Southeastern Theatre Conference Festival will cost approximately $3,000, but we'll cross that bridge if we get there!) As a non-profit center, we rely on grants and donations to support the Center. 
Expenses include the following: rights to perform the play; WVTA registration; transportation for cast, crew and set; additional props (such as canvas and paints).  Those who can help us achieve our goal will be invited to attend an open rehearsal of the production on Friday, November 7th, the night before competition, at the MAC. Following the rehearsal, you'll have a chance to meet and talk with the cast and crew.
 If we don't reach our total campaign goal, all funds will go towards expenses.
If we exceed our total campaign goal, excess funds will be earmarked for future MACplayers productions.
 
  The Impact Community theatre is alive and well in West Virginia, and the MACplayers is just one of several community theatres in Morgantown that offer performances of cutting-edge works like Red. Recognition on the state level and the regional level helps elevate the performing arts in our community!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

It is with great love, passion and ambition that I have traveled this extraordinary journey with Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald. I have so many people to thank for their contribution and support. I have yet one more dream to fulfill: bringing ""Zelda"" to the international stage of the Fringe Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland in August 2012.

</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Mission:</strong><br/>

This mission is two-fold. First, to honor Zelda through educating others to the life and talents of Zelda Fitzgerald. Second, to showcase my my own work and talents through her life and words. Performing in Scotland puts me in a community of my peers as well as an international audience that can provide great avenues for future creative work. I believe we must each create our own possibilities to live our dreams and it takes a community, a village as they say, to help us along the way.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Actors Company of Tulsa is a new theatre company in the Tulsa area. We are dedicated to the education of the theatrical artist, connection with local business and the community and productions of quality that entertain, inform, and enlighten the city of Tulsa. About two years ago, we decided that Angels in America would be the show we would love to do because of it's timeliness and it's themes and issues. We felt that the themes dealt with in this production would resonate in the heartland of America and at this time, we feel it's an important show. We feel that our production of Angels in America will open the eyes and hearts and realize the struggles of these people in this wonderful story by Tony Kushner. <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Angels in America by Tony Kushner has been performed in almost every major city in the world, but has never been performed in Tulsa. Tony Kushner came to visit last year and spoke to the city and ignited a fire in a lot of us to tell this story that centers around the Aids Crisis in the Regan era, but also spans every single type of person that is affected by this community. This is a story of people with problems, and this is a story of hope. We hope that this production will inspire the community and the people of Tulsa that entertainment can also inform and enlighten the world. <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are going to need around $12,000 for the total budget of Angels in America. This money will go to the set costs, theatre costs, lighting costs, sound costs, and the rising theatrical rentals that will be needed to secure our space. From this campaign, we are hoping to raise $5000 dollars from online sources. This will allow us to have a good jumpstart from a grass roots campaign, and if we raise more money through this production, all the proceeds will go to the show. The budget is as follows:<br/><br/></p>
<div>“Angels in American Part 1”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Budget:</strong> </div>
<div>Marketing $700 </div>
<div>Rights $900 (8 shows) </div>
<div>Performance Space $4,800 </div>
<div>Costumes $500 </div>
<div>Properties $500 </div>
<div>Set $500</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Salaries:</strong> </div>
<div>Director $750 </div>
<div>Producer $500 </div>
<div>Stage Manager $250 </div>
<div>Lighting Designer $200 </div>
<div>Costume Designer $200 </div>
<div>Set Designer $200 </div>
<div>Sound Designer $200 </div>
<div>Actors $2,000 (to be divided)</div>
<div>  </div>
<div><strong>Total: $12,200</strong></div>
<p><br/> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Tell everyone you know about this campaign. Tell your friends. Get the word out. We need to know that you support what we are doing because this is going to be amazingly hard to accomplish. But WE can do it. WE can make this happen in our city. And you can be a part of it. Post it everywhere, your facebook, your blog, your groups. Get a group of people to each pledge $1. Every little bit helps. Thanks for your support. </p>

We are going to need around $12,000 for the total budget of Angels in America. This money will go to the set costs, theatre costs, lighting costs, sound costs, and the rising theatrical rentals that will be needed to secure our space. From this campaign, we are hoping to raise $5000 dollars from online sources. This will allow us to have a good jumpstart from a grass roots campaign, and if we raise more money through this production, all the proceeds will go to the show. The budget is as follows:
“Angels in American Part 1”
 

Budget: 
Marketing $700 
Rights $900 (8 shows) 
Performance Space $4,800 
Costumes $500 
Properties $500 
Set $500
 

Salaries: 
Director $750 
Producer $500 
Stage Manager $250 
Lighting Designer $200 
Costume Designer $200 
Set Designer $200 
Sound Designer $200 
Actors $2,000 (to be divided)
  
Total: $12,200

<p>Meet 2013’s graduating actors from California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California!  We have spent the past three or four years in 16-hour days of classes and rehearsals, nausea-inducing work-outs, blurry eyed all-nighters, and record-setting coffee-binges, and now we are awfully excited to transition into professional performing arts circles and make an impact.  CalArts actors are proud to distinguish ourselves in the industry with our training, imagination, boldness and work ethic: alumnis include Don Cheadle, Allison Brie, and Ed Harris, and are featured in major motion pictures and television shows.  Many are leaders in ground-breaking theatre around the world.  Even more important to mention, this particular gang of thespians are among the most thoughtful, supportive and generous artists around!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:</p>
<p>In March, the graduating class is required to travel to New York City as a company to partake in an industry showcase that allows us to interface with casting directors, agents, directors, producers and other industry professionals. This showcase is not only a required element of our final year, but also presents a unique experience and opportunity that for many past students has created significant post-graduation career prospects.</p>
<p>The cost of this trip to New York will far exceed what is within our student living-expenses.  As well as performing in the showcase, it is essential to be able to remain in the city for at least several days following the showcase to meet with interested industry professionals.  Each one of us hopes to spend at least one week in New York following the showcase in order to take full advantage of this trip.  All this will all amount to a slightly sweat-inducing expenditure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For this reason, each year, the graduating acting class is involved in a collective fundraising effort from the beginning of the year with the aim of supplementing each student’s showcase travel. This year, as the largest graduating class ever, we are facing a particular challenge in meeting the needs of each student. But not only have we committed to ourselves to raise the funds to make this trip to New York possible, we have committed to each other! No actor left behind! We’ve been performing free shows, selling-off our worldly belongings, selling serenades and pranks and otherwise making utter fools of ourselves...and the time has come where we need your help!</p>
<p>We humbly request your support.  This showcase will be our first formal introduction to the industry and could likely result in our first vital invitations for representation.  Your donation would be most helpful in navigating this travel expense and things like transportation, food, and lodging, as well as headshots and business cards.  If the devotion and enthusiasm of this group is any indication of how we will contribute to the performing arts, your donation will be both well-appreciated and worthily-spent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We greatly appreciate your support and want to give back for every donation received. If you look at the column to the right of this screen you can see the reward that follows each donation increment.  Thank you from the bottom of our art hearts!</p>

Thirteen years ago, I worked as a preschool teacher.  My BA in Dance from UW was gathering dust when one of the preschool mom's asked me to teach a dance class for her daughter Michaela.  With three students I began to teach at Phinney Neighborhood Center.  I think I paid more in rent than I earned in tuition!  From the start it was important to me that no one was ever turned away who couldn't pay or could only pay a portion.  Soon enough, I taught dance at the preschool where I was a Toddler Teacher, Small Faces.  In 2008 I began teaching all the students at The Community School of West Seattle.  Eventually, I found the Highland Park Improvement Club and relocated many of my class there.  Now I teach in five places and have about 125 students. That’s a lot of little birds and a lot of scattered nests.</p>
<p>But I found us a new home—a big building with twenty-foot ceilings where our hearts can soar!  A space where we can have mirrors on the wall to help us learn.  A place where we can have ballet barre's for Saturday Morning Ballet.  A place that will be greatly improved with floors that will keep us safe, that will protect our longevity in dance and help Gildenfire Dance to thrive with it’s dancers. Our goal is to open the doors with a padded Marley Floor in March 2013.</p>
<p>Hooray, we've got the space! But to make it work, we need:</p>
<p>1.  Most important: Five-eights inch foam underlay and Marely Flooring $6,870 is the total cost for the flooring!</p>
<p>2.  Mirrors: $1,500-$2,500</p>
<p>We have come so far but we need this floor to open the doors!</p>
<p>Why should you help Gildenfire Dance build complete this project?</p>
<p>In short, Gildenfire Dance makes a positive impact in the community. Gildenfire Dance, encourages and uplifts its families and the young dancers who attend classes and perform in local public spaces. Here are some of the ways we do this:</p>
<p>Every year we provide over $1,000 in scholarships to our students in Dance and Acrobatics based on financial need.</p>
<p>Our tuition is far less than most local studios which provides more opportunities for all children to dance.</p>
<p>We donate hundred of dollars in gift certificates to local charities and schools each year.</p>
<p>Our programs are open to all children regardless of differing abilities and strengths.</p>
<p>We build self-confidence, coordination, balance, strength, grace, pride and joy every single time we open the doors.</p>
<p>Our performances often take place in retirement communities, bringing the joy of dance to the elderly, and the joy of the elderly to the dancers.</p>
<p>Please take this moment to support the work Gildenfire does to make a difference in the lives of these amazing young dancers!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul><li>Warts and All has been incubating in my gray matter for over ten years. However, I didn't really discover the path the writing should take until about  year and a half ago. What took so long? I forgot that I love the underdog. It was the Bible's sweet but  nameless women that needed me, not the ones with stained glass windows made in their honor. It was the women with slightly tarnished reputations that wanted their say, their chance in court. So, in my show, those women have it.  This play is a toast to the imperfect woman. The kind of woman that solves problems by shaking her hips,  slipping you a  Mickey, or by slamming a tent peg through your head.  Which, by all accounts, is exactly the kind of woman God loves. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Thankfully, family and friends have covered transportation to and in New York. I could use your help with the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The venue is the Duke Theatre at 229 West 42nd street.  It costs $655.00.</li>
<li>Any money raised beyond that will be put toward the mandatory  15 tickets the festival requires each participant to sell at 20.00 each.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Didn't you just go to a festival this summer Crystal Rae?</p>
<p>Yes! I paid my little happy way to  New York  to participate in  Park Avenue United Methodist Church's  curated artist Wednesdays. Their staff chose a monologue from Warts and All for their festival and I was honored to participate. The New York New Works Festival is different in that the panel judging the event  are all heavy hitters in the theatre industry. Hence my excitement about participating and the higher price tag.</p>
<p><strong>What's after this festival? </strong></p>
<p>Beyond this festival the full length premier of the show will be held at The Ensemble Theatre in Houston, Texas under the umbrella of the their ""local artist"" series. It has a three night run! I couldn't be more thrilled.</p>

<p>Boxed Wine Productions is nearing the end of our first full season of new and exciting theater, and we are currently in rehearsals for our biggest production to date- Paul Rudnick's epic comedy <em>Valhalla</em>. Financially, we're almost there- but we're asking for your help to get us across the finish line.</p>
<p><strong>The Show</strong></p>
<p><em>Valhalla</em> follows the stories of King Ludwig of Bavaria and James Avery, two characters living 60 years and half a world apart. What drives them both is an unshakable need to find and possess what is beautiful in the world around them. They move along their respective paths until finally their stories come crashing in on one another with at times disastrous and hilarious consequences.</p>
<p><em>Valhalla</em> is, amongst many other things, a hilarious comedy with tremendous heart. We fell in love with the characters of King Ludwig and James Avery, and their relentless quests for beauty in a seemingly dark world. We laugh when they fail and cheer when they win, delighting in their ups and downs and urging them forward towards their own Valhallas. But more than anything, we love <em>Valhalla</em> because when we look at it, we see ourselves- and are convinced that audiences will do the same- coming away enlightened, enchanted, and with a smile on their faces, looking for whatever it is that is beautiful and precious to them in their own lives.</p>
<p><strong>What we're asking for:</strong></p>
<p>Funds raised by this campaign (which will be processed and donated to the company through our Fiscal Sponsor, Fractured Atlas, and <strong>are therefore tax deductible</strong>), will go towards the final costs of one of the following costs of production:</p>
<p><em>Space Rental</em>: We've rented a beautiful theater that fits the piece perfectly, and are excited for the first time to be making our home their for a two week run- the longest run of any of our productions to date.</p>
<p><em>Creative Team Fees</em>: After working many years for free, we believe that paying everyone involved in our projects is an essential step towards becoming a more professional and stable company. We have been working to grow our modest stipends for each production- a little bit at a time- in order to help our collaborators make ends meet.</p>
<p><em>Design</em>: Just as ambitious as staging this epic play in the first place- with its seemingly neverending cast of characters and huge shifts in space and time- is designing the space in which the magic can happen. We have an excellent director in Chris Bowser, and an excellent design team in Brian Hendricks, Alex Thrailkill, Kaela Garvin, and Marika Kent. Your donation will help us in transforming the Little Secret Theatre in to a space where all our dreams can come true.</p>

</h3><p><em>Subverted</em> was written as my senior thesis to graduate with honors and a
Bachelors Degree in acting from Pace University. The topic came about because I
have lived in Brooklyn, East New York my whole life and I have witnessed
many people stay “prisoner to the block.” Once I started attending Pace, I realized that often, growing
up in “the hood,” you are accustomed to certain learned behaviors that you only
learn are “wrong” or “classless” when you leave, if you ever get that chance.
When you leave you see that the “outside world” doesn’t dress, talk or live the
way you have your whole life. You are told to assimilate and to be tolerant of
the larger world’s ignorance about where you come from, but the reality is, that
the larger world is never forced to reciprocate. And that’s because “the hood” is
never a place they have to go to improve their lives or reach their American
dream.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/501580/files/20140411133902-1005832_10201341184004528_1331278881_n.jpg?1397248742"" src="""" style=""width: 268.82px; height: 404px;""/></p><br/><h3>The
Synopsis</h3>
<p><em>SUBVERTED</em> portrays the destruction of Black identity as seen through
the eyes of Eden, an 18 year-old girl living in any urban
city in the USA. Through the colliding viewpoints of 18 friends, family
members, and historical figures (all portrayed by actor, writer, and spoken
word poet Dominique Fishback) Eden discovers that the promise of “equal
opportunity” still, to this day, does not exist. She questions why the people
she loves the most continue to live blindly subverted by an

Subverted was written as my senior thesis to graduate with honors and a
Bachelors Degree in acting from Pace University. The topic came about because I
have lived in Brooklyn, East New York my whole life and I have witnessed
many people stay “prisoner to the block.” Once I started attending Pace, I realized that often, growing
up in “the hood,” you are accustomed to certain learned behaviors that you only
learn are “wrong” or “classless” when you leave, if you ever get that chance.
When you leave you see that the “outside world” doesn’t dress, talk or live the
way you have your whole life. You are told to assimilate and to be tolerant of
the larger world’s ignorance about where you come from, but the reality is, that
the larger world is never forced to reciprocate. And that’s because “the hood” is
never a place they have to go to improve their lives or reach their American
dream.The
Synopsis
SUBVERTED portrays the destruction of Black identity as seen through
the eyes of Eden, an 18 year-old girl living in any urban
city in the USA. Through the colliding viewpoints of 18 friends, family
members, and historical figures (all portrayed by actor, writer, and spoken
word poet Dominique Fishback) Eden discovers that the promise of “equal
opportunity” still, to this day, does not exist. She questions why the people
she loves the most continue to live blindly subverted by an
unrelenting history that they did not live through, yet inherit and must
accept. Eden’s journey will make a difference in our understanding of what true
equality actually looks like. What We Need & What You Get
The $12,000 raised will go into booking a NYC theater for a 3 week run! I've only had the opportunity to perform Subverted for very limited runs, such as four performances at Pace University, two performances in Culture Project’s Off Broadway theatre in their Women Center Stage 2013 Festival. And, an upcoming, single performance, at the 14th Street Y with the MCC Youth Theater. But that doesn’t give a great deal of opportunity for you, your family, and your friends to see it, does it?

The money raised will also be going towards paying for an amazingly talented creative team (all of whom have, or are currently, working on Broadway), helmed by director Terry Berliner, who has worked across the country, Off Broadway and on Broadway—as the resident director of The Lion King--and on many other great shows! www.terryberliner.com

 You will get all of this talent, for an off off Broadway Price! 
The donations will also go towards the purchase of all of the materials for set, sound, lighting, costume design, and rehearsal space as well as marketing, promotional material, and more.

<p>Hello Parents,  Students and Staff of LAFA, </p>
<p>My name is Kathy  Zambito and I am here to not only listen but to share my personal experiences  and journey with the Academy both through my eyes and through the eyes of my  daughter Samantha.</p>
<p>Like most parents,  it was important to me that my children be involved in extra-curricular  activities.<span>  It is sometimes a  challenge making that decision and finding and activity or sport that your child  feels excited about. For my husband and I, we not only wanted our children  involved in something physical, but something creative as well.  It is here that we looked at our  children’s personalities to find something that was well-suited to inspire,  motivate and challenge them.</span></p>
<p>I will speak of  Samantha specifically because of her love for and involvement with LAFA.<span>  My daughter was an extremely shy little  girl outside of the home.  While she  had no trouble ‘hamming it up’ at home, she lacked the self confidence to show  off her bubbly personality and sense of humour outside of her comfort zone.  We felt that finding an outlet to bring  Samantha out of her shell and improving her confidence was extremely  important.  Samantha’s exuberance  and energy needed to be shared with others!</span></p>
<p>Now that I’ve  touched on how wonderful I think my daughter is, let me also tell you about my  fondness for Sarah, the owner, director and everything else that makes LAFA what  it is today. Sarah’s passion for the fine arts and for this Academy is something  to be admired and makes her a wonderful role model for our children.<span>  LAFA is not just a ‘babysitting’  service. It is a place our children have gone to learn, grow, make new friends  and have fun. </span></p>
<p>Samantha would not  be the young woman she is today without Sarah’s influence.<span>  Every child needs a mentor outside of  his or her parents and Sarah is exactly that to Samantha.  She is someone to admire and  emulate.  Samantha has made a  journey from being too scared to audition for a play to auditioning for play  with confidence, auditioning for a movies and she is now both a junior  instructor and a junior director with LAFA.  We couldn’t be more proud of her and as  parents, we are extremely grateful for Sarah’s role in our daughter’s  journey.   </span></p>
<p>I am sure many of  you parents are feeling the same way. Watching our sons and daughters express  themselves through acting and performance art is something to be admired.<span>  We have also watched these kids become  responsible, respectful and confident young adults.  There is not much else a parent can ask  for. </span></p>
<p>On behalf of  Sarah, LAFA, myself, my family and hopefully your families as well, I am making  a plea that we all take part in helping to save LAFA.<span>  Not only for our children but for young  children looking for an outlet or activity to stimulate and excite them.  </span></p>
<p>Those of us who  know Sarah know that she does this for the pure love and passion she has for  acting, improv and the performing arts.<span>   And as I have seen personally, she has a special bond with all of our  children and takes a vested interest in their confidence, happiness, creativity  and involvement with LAFA.</span></p>
<p>I ask that we  return this passion and show our gratitude by giving back in any way we  can.<span>  Let’s band together as parents  of LAFA and supporters of Sarah to do what we can to raise money to open a new  facility and continue to watch our children flourish and grow as well as  children in generations to come.   </span></p>

Hello Parents,  Students and Staff of LAFA, 
My name is Kathy  Zambito and I am here to not only listen but to share my personal experiences  and journey with the Academy both through my eyes and through the eyes of my  daughter Samantha.
Like most parents,  it was important to me that my children be involved in extra-curricular  activities.  It is sometimes a  challenge making that decision and finding and activity or sport that your child  feels excited about. For my husband and I, we not only wanted our children  involved in something physical, but something creative as well.  It is here that we looked at our  children’s personalities to find something that was well-suited to inspire,  motivate and challenge them.
I will speak of  Samantha specifically because of her love for and involvement with LAFA.  My daughter was an extremely shy little  girl outside of the home.  While she  had no trouble ‘hamming it up’ at home, she lacked the self confidence to show  off her bubbly personality and sense of humour outside of her comfort zone.  We felt that finding an outlet to bring  Samantha out of her shell and improving her confidence was extremely  important.  Samantha’s exuberance  and energy needed to be shared with others!
Now that I’ve  touched on how wonderful I think my daughter is, let me also tell you about my  fondness for Sarah, the owner, director and everything else that makes LAFA what  it is today. Sarah’s passion for the fine arts and for this Academy is something  to be admired and makes her a wonderful role model for our children.  LAFA is not just a ‘babysitting’  service. It is a place our children have gone to learn, grow, make new friends  and have fun. 
Samantha would not  be the young woman she is today without Sarah’s influence.  Every child needs a mentor outside of  his or her parents and Sarah is exactly that to Samantha.  She is someone to admire and  emulate.  Samantha has made a  journey from being too scared to audition for a play to auditioning for play  with confidence, auditioning for a movies and she is now both a junior  instructor and a junior director with LAFA.  We couldn’t be more proud of her and as  parents, we are extremely grateful for Sarah’s role in our daughter’s  journey.   
I am sure many of  you parents are feeling the same way. Watching our sons and daughters express  themselves through acting and performance art is something to be admired.  We have also watched these kids become  responsible, respectful and confident young adults.  There is not much else a parent can ask  for. 
On behalf of  Sarah, LAFA, myself, my family and hopefully your families as well, I am making  a plea that we all take part in helping to save LAFA.  Not only for our children but for young  children looking for an outlet or activity to stimulate and excite them.

<p>
</p><p>We started a year ago, we moved <a href=""http://www.studiosharise.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Studio Sharise – Discover the Artist Within (our Creative and Performing Art School)</a>"" - into the upstairs unit at the Burbank Theater (<a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/san-jose-neighborhoods/ci_24325989/san-joses-burbank-theater-is-now-home-studio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">San Jose Mercury News covered the story</a>) .  We had lengthy discussions with the owners to start plans to renovate and restore
the whole Theater... Well as the weeks and months went on - we realized that these owners were really just happy to take our money and were very content to do nothing...</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>So if the owners are doing nothing, what is this campaign for?<br/></b></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, not only did the owners happily

</p><p>
</p><p>What happens if we get more than the

<p>
</p><p>We have plenty of things in mind. The

will repair the lighting that illuminates the sidewalks at night,
encouraging those that prey in the shadows to look for shadows
somewhere else.  We will install night vision security cameras on all

carriers of the graffitists.  And lastly we will hire a neon light

</p><p><b>The Results:</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>If we make our campaign goal, then in 4

is very likely – as we'll explain below); then what happens next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once we own the building, private

<p>
</p><p>Seeing each of you donate to this

into something fantastic!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But wait!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do we think we'll win at Public
Auction in 4 months from now? And what if we are outbid?</p>
<p>
</p><p>“Upside down” is the term.  The 1<sup>st</sup>
mortgage by itself is several hundred thousand dollars MORE than the
current commercial valuation of the Burbank Theater.  So if this
building does go to Public Auction next month from the 1<sup>st</sup>
mortgage foreclosure, it's questionable if anyone will want to buy
the building at the asking price the bank is required to ask by law.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... since we purchased the 2<sup>nd</sup>
mortgage, if we stop the 1<sup>st</sup> mortgage foreclosure by
paying them the overdue amount – in 4 months when we put this up for
Public Auction the building won't be massively Upside down –<b><i> it
will be Ridiculously Upside down</i><i>.  Which will likely scare away any
potential real estate developer or investors who just wants to try and
use the Theater to make a quick profit.  
</i></b></p>
<p>
</p><p>So it's “unlikely” anyone else will
outbid us in 4 months, but – it's not impossible.  So what would we
do – if we don't end up being the owner?</p><p>Simple. Remember above we
mentioned a year ago we moved ""<a href=""http://www.studiosharise.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Studio Sharise</a>"" into the Upstairs?  We have signed 10 year leases. Unfortunately if the new owner is crazy enough to outbid us at public
auction to buy a property massively overpriced – they may try to take us to court to try and get rid of us. If that happens – we
would use the proceeds from this campaign to fight the new owner in
court; the goal is the same prevent the building from being
bull-dozed, and then get it refurbished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively if the new owner really
just wants to be the owner of the Theater - then as mentioned in our
“What happens if we get more than the campaign goal?” section
above - we would insist on having the outside of the building
refurbished – and we would use the money you donated to us for that

<p>BOOTLEGGERS RUN has been a dream of mine for two years. I thought, “How cool would it be to<em> live</em> inside a 1930's mobster film?” You know, where they dress the dress, and talk that ole “mobster talk” right at you. What if you could meet the likes of the <em>real</em> Lucky Luciano, or bootleg for “Scarface” Al Capone?</p>
<p>In short BOOTLEGGERS RUN will transport you into a stylized world (like a mobster film from way back in the day) where you and nine others will travel back in time and experience fascinating moments and places.  All the while interacting face-to-face with the founders of organized crime in America.  Here you’ll play both sides of the law.  Come live your history!</p>
<p>Your generous contributions will help take Live IN Theater to the next level. In order to do this the right way, we need “mula”. Funding will help with the look of the production, dialogue training by coaches from HBO’s Boardwalk Empire, movement, music, and rehearsal space. To the moon Alice! </p>
<p><strong>About Live IN Theater</strong></p>
<p>Live IN Theater creates interactive murder mysteries and immersive experiences through the streets of NYC, based &amp; inspired by real life. Come live your history!</p>
<p><strong>About Carlo D'Amore</strong></p>
<p>I love history and I love the theater. I want to continue to use moments in history to create utterly unique experiences that place the audience in <em>the </em>middle of the action as they Live IN Theater. Audiences are wanting more.  There is an unspoken demand for theater to catch up with the rest of the world. The days of passively experiencing theater are beginning to change. I love the theater because when it works it can be magic. But our relationships and lives are changing at a very rapid pace, and theater needs to evolve.

</div></div>","BOOTLEGGERS RUN has been a dream of mine for two years. I thought, “How cool would it be to live inside a 1930's mobster film?” You know, where they dress the dress, and talk that ole “mobster talk” right at you. What if you could meet the likes of the real Lucky Luciano, or bootleg for “Scarface” Al Capone?
In short BOOTLEGGERS RUN will transport you into a stylized world (like a mobster film from way back in the day) where you and nine others will travel back in time and experience fascinating moments and places.  All the while interacting face-to-face with the founders of organized crime in America.  Here you’ll play both sides of the law.  Come live your history!
Your generous contributions will help take Live IN Theater to the next level. In order to do this the right way, we need “mula”. Funding will help with the look of the production, dialogue training by coaches from HBO’s Boardwalk Empire, movement, music, and rehearsal space. To the moon Alice! 
About Live IN Theater
Live IN Theater creates interactive murder mysteries and immersive experiences through the streets of NYC, based & inspired by real life. Come live your history!
About Carlo D'Amore
I love history and I love the theater. I want to continue to use moments in history to create utterly unique experiences that place the audience in the middle of the action as they Live IN Theater. Audiences are wanting more.  There is an unspoken demand for theater to catch up with the rest of the world. The days of passively experiencing theater are beginning to change. I love the theater because when it works it can be magic. But our relationships and lives are changing at a very rapid pace, and theater needs to evolve. It needs to become less exclusive, more inclusive and accessible. So, whether it’s called “process drama”, “reality theater”, immersive, interactive or whatever, for me as an artist it is ultimately about play. Play = Fun. Come play with us!

<h3>Who are we? </h3>
<p>IMPACT Dance Company is a Contemporary Dance company with an array of talented dancers with different backgrounds, body types, ethincities and education. As a company we strive to raise awareness, volunteer in multiple communities and utilize dance as a medium for positivity in life. </p>

<h3>Dance is my passion.</h3>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p><strong>My name is Ben Green and dance is my passion</strong>. I have been dancing for a total of 3 years now, but dance has always been in my blood. Dancing with umbrellas in the living room was quite a love of mine at a very young age. So you can say that dancing runs through my veins. </p>
<p>I am a contemporary dancer with training in modern dance techniques including Horton &amp; Graham, and also training in Ballet and Jazz. I have attending Las Vegas Academy of Performing Arts as a dance major for 3 years, and have made it into the prestigious, highest level in the school for my upcoming senior year. </p>
<p>My teachers have always complimented me on my work ethic, focus, and my sophomore  dance teacher said, <strong>""You work like a bull in my class.""</strong> I have always taken dance very seriously and always strived to improve on my technique and develop my own style and choreography.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>An amazing opportunity.</h3>
<p>After the best audition of my life, I have been offered a spot on the highest <strong>Senior Performing Arts Company at Bunker Dance Center, </strong>the most prestigious and best dance studios in Nevada. It is an amazing honor to be given this opportunity and I would be the only male dancer on the team, which consists of all of my closest friends.</p>
<p>Being a part of the studio I will have the opportunity to work with world renowned choreographers, and <strong>So You Think You Can Dance choreographic masters</strong>, such as <strong>Peter Chu, Stacey Tookey, Travis Wal</strong>l, along with taking classes with amazing faculty from professional dance companies all over the world. I have gotten the opportunity to work with these amazing individuals before, along with my dream teacher and owner of <strong>Kidd Pivot</strong> dance company, <strong>Krystal Pite</strong>, but I would love to be able to work with these choreographers and execute their pieces on a regular basis. </p>
<p>Along with the amazing training and pieces I would be able to experience, Bunker Dance Center also is nationally acclaimed when it comes to dance competitions, and many of the competitions I would be a part of offer <strong>amazing college scholarships</strong>. </p>
<p>All around, this is an opportunity I would devastated to have to turn down.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>I need your help.</h3>
<h3><strong>The tuition for my dance classes because of how advanced the company team I would be on, and the competion and travel fees, comes to about $12,000 dollars a year. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Almost $1,000 a month. </strong></h3>
<p>With my current financial situation at home, I cannot pay for this. I am able to pay bits and pieces here and there depending on the fees due that month, but <strong>I NEED YOUR HELP to make this dream come a reality.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any donation helps! The little contributions all add up, and anything you can give helps my chances of being able to stay a part of this amazing dance company!</strong></p>

<h3>Can't donate? There are other ways to help!</h3>
<p>As my family is struggling financially,<strong> I complete understand that a donation is not a possiblity for everyone</strong>, and that is competely okay! </p>
<p><strong>I would really appreciate it if you would just spread the word about my campaign to your friends, family, on your social networking sites, and to anyone who might be intersted in sponsoring a young dancer</strong>.</p>

<p>Welcome to our Indiegogo campaign!  Many of you know us already, as you've supported us the past three years by coming to see one or more of our shows.  In June we're producing a staged reading of <em>Abundance</em>, written by Beth Henley, and a production of <em>Talley's Folly</em>, by Lanford Wilson.  We are hoping to raise $3,000 to pay for the following items:</p>
<p>1) Production Rights = $600</p>
<p>2) Actors &amp; Crew = $1,000</p>
<p>3) Sets, Lights, Costumes &amp; Props = $1,000</p>
<p>4) Publicity = $400</p>
<p>We've worked with many incredible people over the past three years, and this year the following folks are collaborating with us: Larry Hecht, Holly Temple, Greg Ungar, Diana Dresser, Drew Horwitz, Brian Shea, Mindi Kessler, Te Yelland, Stefan Richmond, Julia Owen, and Davy Davis.</p>
<p>Any size contribution will help.  Really.  $5 or $10 is great.  It'll help us buy a costume piece, or pay for a lighting instrument, or take a bite out of purchasing the licensing rights to both plays.  And if you can't contribute here, please come see ABUNDANCE and TALLEY'S FOLLY in June, and help spread the word about us.</p>

<h3>Check out photography on display in Gorham, ME at The Gorham Grind. All proceeds from the sale will go to the project!</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a twenty year old college student from Maine. I spent over a month last year in Kenya learning about the health system, meeting clinicians and getting to know a beautiful country with huge potential. The people I met there have a passion to help their fellow citizens, but the opportunity is too often few and far between. We have a recyclable, easy-to-use, cost-effective and most importantly life-changing clubfoot bracing system. This innovation will allow communities to change the future's of it's children. This deformity can no longer steal regular lives from the 1 in 1000 children born each year. It's design is perfect for an underdeveloped system and this fundraiser will allow us to bring it to the communities in Kenya.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Where It Goes</h3>
<p>The specifics of this project are straightforward. The brace is incredibly easy to use, once someone has basic training (which can easily be done in less than an hour). It is a plastic brace that comes in a size that has fit every child treated so far. It can be used again and again throughout each community. The funds we need are in order to bring us back to the nation of Kenya to do the initial training and to create enough braces to provide the clinics and health centers with. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project has the potential to make treating clubfoot in Kenya a reality. Currently this is a deformity that means the end of a life for a child in Kenya. It means no ability to walk or work and in many cases, in a developing nation, that means no livelihood for the child. There is no future for too many children crippled with clubfoot. However, this bracing system seems to be a perfect, easy and renewable system to give them back the chance at life.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't give to our fundraiser, we would love your support. Spread the world about our site and our mission! Send the link to your friends and family. Knowledge is key and we need help to get knowledge of our project out there!</p>
<p>Thank you for taking some time out of your busy workday or from a long to-do list.

<p>We are a youth run non-profit theatre company in Kingston, Ontario looking to raise funds to help us continue to provide opportunities in theatre for youth between the ages of 13-30. Blue Canoe has been established in our community for the past 7 years; we have produced 22 productions engaging over 500 youth in theatre, dance, music and theatre production. Several of our alumni have gone on to pursue theatre at post-secondary and professional levels. Our goal is to provide youth a chance to explore the performing arts as a platform to further pursuits or simply as an outlet for creativity. We need your support to help continue to offer these wonderful opportunities to our membership.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://queensjournal.ca/media/photo_cache/story_photos/2012/04/05/20120329-Charlie_Brown-AC-IMG_5627-WEB_first_.jpg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><em>You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown- 2012</em><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></h2>
<p>Kingston’s youth theatre company is looking for funding to help continue to provide opportunities for young people between the ages of 13-30 in the performing arts. We help them to gain experience creating theatre in the community of Kingston, not just within the school systems. As a non-profit organization, we have access to project funds to help specific productions, but not operation expenses to offset space rental, insurance, storage and other day to day expenses. Though we have been able to bring in funds through ticket sales, the company continues to grow and ticket sales are simply not enough to keep us operating.</p>
<p>Many student run companies have been able to engage youth at the post-secondary schools or within high schools, but the unique opportunities Blue Canoe offers bring students into the community and with your help, this funding will enable our company to continue to serve the youth of our community.</p>
<p><strong> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://queensjournal.ca/media/photo_cache/story_photos/2013/01/17/20130117_DrowsyChap_TL_7727_web_mobile_.jpg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><em>The Drowsy Chaperone- 2013</em></p>
<h2><strong>Blue Canoe’s Impact on the Community</strong></h2>
<p>Blue Canoe brings High School, Post Secondary and other youths together under one roof for the same common goal: to create quality affordable theatre for the community of Kingston and the 1000 Islands. Over the past 7 years we have engaged over 500 youth in 22 theatrical productions in Kingston and Gananoque.</p>
<p>In our 2012 season we produced 5 musical productions all at the Baby Grand Theatre, downtown Kingston, with audiences all over 88% of our total house capacity, with 3 productions having sold out runs; Cabaret (January 2012), You’re a Good Man Charlie Brown (April 2012) and Avenue Q (August 2012). We have animated the Baby Grand theatre with big musicals and entertained the community with our energy and drive.</p>

We are a youth run non-profit theatre company in Kingston, Ontario looking to raise funds to help us continue to provide opportunities in theatre for youth between the ages of 13-30. Blue Canoe has been established in our community for the past 7 years; we have produced 22 productions engaging over 500 youth in theatre, dance, music and theatre production. Several of our alumni have gone on to pursue theatre at post-secondary and professional levels. Our goal is to provide youth a chance to explore the performing arts as a platform to further pursuits or simply as an outlet for creativity. We need your support to help continue to offer these wonderful opportunities to our membership.

You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown- 2012
Why We Need Your Help
Kingston’s youth theatre company is looking for funding to help continue to provide opportunities for young people between the ages of 13-30 in the performing arts. We help them to gain experience creating theatre in the community of Kingston, not just within the school systems. As a non-profit organization, we have access to project funds to help specific productions, but not operation expenses to offset space rental, insurance, storage and other day to day expenses. Though we have been able to bring in funds through ticket sales, the company continues to grow and ticket sales are simply not enough to keep us operating.
Many student run companies have been able to engage youth at the post-secondary schools or within high schools, but the unique opportunities Blue Canoe offers bring students into the community and with your help, this funding will enable our company to continue to serve the youth of our community.

Blue Canoe’s Impact on the Community
Blue Canoe brings High School, Post Secondary and other youths together under one roof for the same common goal: to create quality affordable theatre for the community of Kingston and the 1000 Islands. Over the past 7 years we have engaged over 500 youth in 22 theatrical productions in Kingston and Gananoque.
In our 2012 season we produced 5 musical productions all at the Baby Grand Theatre, downtown Kingston, with audiences all over 88% of our total house capacity, with 3 productions having sold out runs; Cabaret (January 2012), You’re a Good Man Charlie Brown (April 2012) and Avenue Q (August 2012). We have animated the Baby Grand theatre with big musicals and entertained the community with our energy and drive.

<br/></strong></div><strong><strong><h3><strong>Hi and thank you for checking
out our campaign! 
Are you looking for a new theatrical experience this
holiday season that’ll lift your spirits without seeing any ghosts? We’ve
written a new, original feel-good musical for the holidays and want to present
the World Premiere this season – with your help. It’s a musicalized version of
the beloved short story by O. Henry, “Gift of the Magi”, with additional
characters and plot lines. </strong></h3>
<h3>
<strong>
</strong>
</h3>
<h3><strong>The story takes place in New York City circa 1905, where
a young woman named Della wants to buy her husband, Jim, a gold chain for his
cherished pocket watch, but can’t afford it. So, she sells her gorgeous long
hair in order to buy it. When she buys it and gives it to him at Christmas, he
can no longer use it, because he sold his precious watch in order to buy Della
beautiful combs for her long hair! It’s a poignant, ironic tale of sacrifice
and love.</strong></h3>
<h3>
<strong>
</strong>
</h3>
<h3><strong>We’re planning to produce this musical in the Los Angeles
area for a 3-week run in December 2014 and need to raise $40,000 in order to do
it. That’s where we need your help. And we have great perks for you, too!
You’ll be a part of presenting a heart-warming piece of theatre to the
community and receive our undying gratitude.</strong></h3>
<h3>
<strong>
</strong>
</h3>
<h3><strong>“<a href=""www.giftofthemagithemusical.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gift of the Magi: The Musical</a>"" was presented as a staged
reading by the Dramatists Guild a few years ago and was very well-received. We
look forward to taking the next step in its development, if you can give us
your support. We appreciate any amount. Think of your donation as an early
holiday gift. : - )</strong></h3>

</div></div>","Hi and thank you for checking
out our campaign! 
Are you looking for a new theatrical experience this
holiday season that’ll lift your spirits without seeing any ghosts? We’ve
written a new, original feel-good musical for the holidays and want to present
the World Premiere this season – with your help. It’s a musicalized version of
the beloved short story by O. Henry, “Gift of the Magi”, with additional
characters and plot lines. 




The story takes place in New York City circa 1905, where
a young woman named Della wants to buy her husband, Jim, a gold chain for his
cherished pocket watch, but can’t afford it. So, she sells her gorgeous long
hair in order to buy it. When she buys it and gives it to him at Christmas, he
can no longer use it, because he sold his precious watch in order to buy Della
beautiful combs for her long hair! It’s a poignant, ironic tale of sacrifice
and love.




We’re planning to produce this musical in the Los Angeles
area for a 3-week run in December 2014 and need to raise $40,000 in order to do
it. That’s where we need your help. And we have great perks for you, too!
You’ll be a part of presenting a heart-warming piece of theatre to the
community and receive our undying gratitude.




“Gift of the Magi: The Musical"" was presented as a staged
reading by the Dramatists Guild a few years ago and was very well-received. We
look forward to taking the next step in its development, if you can give us
your support. We appreciate any amount. Think of your donation as an early
holiday gift. : - )




If you’d like to donate, but
don’t want to do it online, you may send a check made out to FRACTURED
ATLAS  and mail it to: The Magi Company P.O. Box 333 Lake Forest, CA 92609. Thanks!






And if you can’t afford to donate, please “like”, share, or
comment on our sites, or forward this email to friends. 

Thank you in advance!

<p><strong>Site-Specific Theatre</strong><br/><em>Dear Life </em>is part of the <a href=""http://www.vancouverfringe.com/onsite/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fringe Onsite</a> Program in the 2013 Vancouver Fringe Festival. This is site-specific theatre, meaning the show is written for, and performed at, a specific location: the Granville Island kid's waterpark.</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong><br/> Two sisters trapped in the realm between life and death battle a fearful darkness that holds them there. Will they take grasp of the life they let slip through their fingers, or be ferried prematurely to their death -- or worse, be condemned to limbo for eternity? Sibling angst and sword fights ensue.</p>

<p>This production tells of two families who've been affected by a
common enemy, but neither family saw it coming.  There were no predictors
on what was about to take place and how drastically their lives would be changed
forever.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We need to be able to put on a production that would educate
individuals and their families regarding <i><b>Alzheimer’s</b></i> and <i><b>Dementia</b></i>,  through <b><i>Performing Arts</i></b> and provide an
outlet especially for caregivers.  We
want to also be able to connect them to resources within their community.</p>
<p>In order to do this we need a budget of <b>$20,000</b> which
will help to cover the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The
band</span></li>

<p></p>
<p>Perks are to the right of this campaign:</p>
<p>There are perks to the right of this campaign some of which are at various levels that will help to bring this production to the stage, a voice to those that are affected, and that will also show our appreciation for your support.  <b><i>Secret</i></b> <b><i>Perks</i></b> are available at the <b><i>Silver</i></b> through <b><i>Platinum</i></b> levels.</p>
<p>Availability of perks:</p>

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>There are a number of people
and families within certain communities that have been affected by <b><i>Alzheimer’s</i></b>
or <b><i>Dementia</i></b>, but some of them are suffering in silence.  For the vast majority this is their first
encounter with a disease of this magnitude and they don’t know how to deal with
the feelings and emotional baggage that this disease can bring.</p>
<p><b><i>Education</i></b> is key and bringing

This production tells of two families who've been affected by a
common enemy, but neither family saw it coming.  There were no predictors
on what was about to take place and how drastically their lives would be changed
forever.
   What We Need & What You Get 
We need to be able to put on a production that would educate
individuals and their families regarding Alzheimer’s and Dementia,  through Performing Arts and provide an
outlet especially for caregivers.  We
want to also be able to connect them to resources within their community.
In order to do this we need a budget of $20,000 which
will help to cover the following:


The
band
Stipend
for the actors
Sound
and Lighting
Theater
space rental for tech rehearsal(s) and show(s)
Set
design and prop rental
Wardrobe
Marketing & Advertising
Resource gathering for caregivers and their families in various cities


Perks are to the right of this campaign:
There are perks to the right of this campaign some of which are at various levels that will help to bring this production to the stage, a voice to those that are affected, and that will also show our appreciation for your support.  Secret Perks are available at the Silver through Platinum levels.
Availability of perks:



Platinum Level (1)  - available through special link

Gold Level (3) - available through special link
Silver Level (10)  - available through special link
Bronze Level (6)





   The Impact 
There are a number of people
and families within certain communities that have been affected by Alzheimer’s
or Dementia, but some of them are suffering in silence.  For the vast majority this is their first
encounter with a disease of this magnitude and they don’t know how to deal with
the feelings and emotional baggage that this disease can bring.
Education is key and bringing
this information to people in a comfortable, entertaining, but yet realistic
way that will give people the space to share, laugh, cry, feel connected, be
uplifted, become educated, and feel empowered to make a difference and know
that they are not alone.
This will also help families
to make more informed decisions when it comes to the care of a loved one as
well as the importance of taking care of themselves as a caregiver.

<p>Hi everybody. If we haven't met, my name is Walker Vreeland and I'm an actor, singer, writer and radio personality. I am so excited that my autobiographical monologue FROM SHIP TO SHAPE will be making its New York premiere at the United Solo Theatre Festival in September of 2017. Please help this show make its mark in NY so that this important story can reach as many people as possible.<br/> </p>
<h3>What is FROM SHIP TO SHAPE?</h3>
<p>When I was 23, I took a job as a lead singer for Norwegian Cruise Lines. But I could never have imagined the voyage that lay ahead. Boarding the Bermuda-bound ship would precipitate a mental breakdown so severe, I would wind up months later at Johns Hopkins Hospital's Mood Disorder Psychiatric Ward. FROM SHIP TO SHAPE is a tragicomic (and musical) autobiographical monologue about one young man’s struggle with mental illness in today’s world. It's about losing your mind while chasing your dreams, the relentless pursuit of healing and how a cruise ship can push you over the edge. Learn more about the show at <a href=""http://www.fromshiptoshape.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fromshiptoshape.com</a><br/> </p>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>Here's why FROM SHIP TO SHAPE is a story that needs to be told:</p>
<ul>
<li>The more awareness raised about the issue of mental illness the better it is for everyone. A more educated, enlightened public means those who need help are more likely to get it, and the medical community receives the support necessary to provide and improve that help.</li>
<li>The subject matter is universal. One in four people struggle with mental illness in some form. We are not alone. And yet, the stigma surrounding it is still prevalent in our culture. Most people don't want to talk about it, even in this day and age. Did you know that only half of those affected seek treatment because they are embarrassed or ashamed? According to The National Alliance on Mental Illness, “The average delay between the onset of symptoms and intervention is 8-10 years.”</li>
<li>Standing up and telling our stories of suffering and recovery with honesty, humor and self-acceptance normalizes mental illness and ensures the stigma and shame is upstaged by a sense of shared humanity, solidarity and the dignity that all survivors deserve to feel. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">A world in which we can laugh at and make fun of our own mental breakdowns is a world in which those who are instinctually reticent to reach out for the help they</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> so desperately need will more likely have the courage to do so.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<br/>What I Need</h3>
<div>
<p>My ultimate goal is for the show to have a run Off-Broadway and subsequent tour so that it may reach as wide an audience as possible. Then I intend to adapt the monologue into a book, and then a film.</p>
<p>In order to get there, I need this premiere to have an impact. The show needs to sell as much as possible, so that a real buzz is created, so that it's reviewed as much as possible, so that the right people see it- people who will be able to assist in taking FROM SHIP TO SHAPE to its next stage of evolution.</p>
<div>
<p>All funds raised will go towards the following expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>rehearsal space</li>
<li>marketing items (such as flyers, programs, etc.)</li>
<li>hiring a director</li>
<li>hiring a stage manager</li>
<li>hiring a lighting designer</li>
<li>hiring lighting and sound operators</li>
<li>hiring musicians to play for the show</li>
<li>hiring a publicist</li>
<li>advertising</li>
</ul>

<p>***5% of all funds raised will be donated to The Alexander Wilson Schweizer Fellowship which funds a mood disorders teaching program at Johns Hopkins Hospital.

<h3>In Brief</h3>
<p>A princess escapes with her lover, only to lose both her child and husband. In her grief, she falls into an eternal slumber and transforms into a vast mountain range in northern Thailand. But when a boy's soccer team becomes entrapped in her caves, the princess awakens and a new relationship begins.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are a team of Thai and American theatre artists that are passionate about representation, mythology, and drama! Come meet us:<ul>
<li>SJ is a theatre-maker with a specialty in puppetry of all forms. They are an alum of Northwestern University and currently traveling Thailand as a Henry Luce Scholar using performance to help with community-building and empowerment.</li>
<li>Greg is a director and writer (usually) based in DC. He is an alum of the University of Michigan and affiliated with the Lab for Global Performance and Politics and 4615 Theatre Co.</li>
<li>Irene is a performer who also runs InsightPact, a design research and  leadership development consultancy. Irene is a calls Bangkok, Berlin and the US East Coast home. DOI NANG NON is Irene’s return to theater since performing in <i>Avenue Q</i> in 2013 and <i>Urinetown</i> in 2014. </li>
<li>Mack is a performer and co-founder of Splashing Theatre in Bangkok. An alum of Thammasat University, Mack has been seen all over Bangkok's theatre scene most recently in B-Floor's <i>Manoland</i>, and the Thai-Japanese collabaration, <i>Pratthana</i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The world was watching closely when the Wild Boars soccer team was trapped in the caves of Doi Nang Non. Us Americans were exhausted from the white-centric focus on Elon Musk and Hollywood's immediate jump on developing a story centering around British saviors. Our Thai collaborators were equally upset with how Thai celebrities and government officials were quick to capitalize on the event for fame and reputation. We decided that we wanted to work on a play that focuses solely on what happened in the caves -- not on the outside. When we discovered that there is an entire mythological tradition involving the life of the mountains itself, we knew that our story would be one that would put Thailand first, above all. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Thanks to a grant from the Asia Foundation in partnership with the Henry Luce Foundation, we were able to offset a lot of costs, but now we just need to cover the loose-ends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Puppetry construction, design, and materials costs: This play will make extensive use of shadow puppets designed by Jae Sirikarn Bunjongtad. We want to pay her fairly for her work and also give her budget to help create the best figures from quality materials, especially in the case of redesign or accidents!</li>
<li>Wages: The money will help contribute to the stipend we are providing our performers, staff, and musicians too! Nobody works for free, and we will ensure that our team will earn fair compensation for their labor.</li>
<li>If the funds do not reach our goal, we will use whatever money received and focus it on our team's wages. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our show aims to shift the narrative away from the ""rescuers"" and onto the history of Northern-Thailand, its rich mythological tradition, and, of course, the boys team.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the show opens, we will submit it to festivals around the world to help spread the story!</li>
<li>Our team has a track record of success: Greg directed the world premiere of Emily Wilson's translation of <i>The Odyssey; </i>and received critical acclaim from <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>DC Metro Theatre Arts<i>, </i></i><i>DC Theatre Scene</i> and more for his regional premiere of <i>410[GONE] </i>by Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig.  SJ helped <i>Manoland<i> </i></i>tour to Tokyo, Japan with Mack as a performer, as well as serving a stage manager for the production in all of its iterations. They also created puppetry for B-Floor's <i>Midsummer Night's Dream<i> </i></i>and work with <i>Makhampom Theatre Group</i> on creating workshops for communities in northern Thailand. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our rehearsal process will be a fast one, and of course since play is so ambitious there are many challenges we will face. </p>
<ul>
<li>The rehearsal process is short, but having workshopped the piece already in prior, we have defined goals to reach. Seriously, some of the choreography and sequences have already been created!</li>
<li>We have a research trip planned in Chiang Rai to help develop a concrete concept and implement it in place for the process.</li>
<li>Greg received training at Odin Teatret and specializes in physical scores and movement creation. He's also worked with incredible director-choreographers like Carolina Pizarro, Linda Goodrich, Jesca Prudencio, Anita Gonzalez, and Joel Valentin-Martinez and has a clear and concise method of creating streamlined movement.</li>
<li>SJ and Jae are expert puppeteers and craftspeople, who have breadths of experience in creating and using custom and found objects too!</li>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We are a group of female dancers wanting to share our stories and voices through movement and art. Mook Dance Company was created by Artistic Director, Winnie Berger, in 2014. Her passion for choreography bloomed out of an Independent Study in which she created a 30 minute piece about her sister, Violet, who was diagnosed with Autism in 2013. With a 16 year age gap and a 3000 mile distance, the biggest gift she felt she could give was art. Post graduation, the sentiments of sharing her story through choreography and dance remained. Mook was created in the casual sense of Winnie simply wanting to create and move with people she felt were honest, caring, humble, and wickedly talented. And that is the kind of art and environment Mook still aims to accomplish, although on a much broader and more serious scale now. We have our first all Mook single bill show, called <i>sub//merge</i>, in April 2017, and we couldn't be more excited for this next big step. </p>
<p>Since 2014, Mook has added and created 10 works for their repertoire, and we continue to make more! We aim to create movement that tells a story tangible to audience members that is ethereal, comprehensible, evocative, and relatable.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why we need help</h3>
<p>Having a small company in New York City is one of the most arduous pursuits imaginable. Not only is the city saturated with small dance companies, but there is little money or support for the arts, in general. Applying for grants, raising money, and having any sort of monetary base for our company to thrive and grow has been increasingly challenging. And this is where we need your help. We need help in funding for the first quarter of our 2nd year. </p>
<p>Mook Dance Company's 2017 Season is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of Mook Dance Company must be made payable to Fractured Atlas only and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.</p>

Since 2014, Mook has added and created 10 works for their repertoire, and we continue to make more! We aim to create movement that tells a story tangible to audience members that is ethereal, comprehensible, evocative, and relatable.

 
Why we need help
Having a small company in New York City is one of the most arduous pursuits imaginable. Not only is the city saturated with small dance companies, but there is little money or support for the arts, in general. Applying for grants, raising money, and having any sort of monetary base for our company to thrive and grow has been increasingly challenging. And this is where we need your help. We need help in funding for the first quarter of our 2nd year. 
Mook Dance Company's 2017 Season is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of Mook Dance Company must be made payable to Fractured Atlas only and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><i>Welcome to Our Home - Tangled</i></h3>
<p><strong>Human Body Expression presents a world premiere at dance: made in canada/fait au canada this summer, choreographed by HBE's Founder &amp; Artistic Director Hanna Kiel. The work features eleven emerging dance artists from the Toronto community, and will be performed from August 17-20, 2017 on d:mic/fac's Mainstage at the prestigious Betty Oliphant Theatre.</strong></p>
<p><i>Welcome to Our Home - Tangled</i>  explores the strength behind the family bond. Inspired by family relationships, in this piece we witness the ups and downs around a family’s differences, conflicts, and inner workings. Amidst this turmoil the family nonetheless finds a way to unite; its members still feel love and compassion for one another. From this work, choreographer Hanna Kiel questions, “What makes a family stick together through the thick and thin, and why is this bond unbreakable?”  Through exploring different personalities and the physical relationships between them, <i>Welcome to Our Home - Tangled</i> aspires to discover the true strength behind the family bond. </p>

<h3>Where You Come In: Give &amp; Get Back</h3>
<p>With a cast of eleven dancers, the scale of this production is significantly larger than most of the other works being presented at d:mic/fac 2017.  As such, <strong>HBE needs your help to ensure our artists are properly compensated for their work. </strong>Your contributions will go directly to paying the fourteen artists (choreographer, rehearsal director, composer, lighting designer, and eleven dancers) for their involvement in the project.</p>
<p>This time commitment includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>60 hours of creation/rehearsal</li>
<li>4 hours of tech rehearsal</li>
<li>3 performances at the Betty Oliphant Theatre</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>With your support, we aim to provide our artists with a minimum of $500 each. </strong>d:mic/fac's $3,000 fee, combined with our goal to raise an additional $5,000, will allow us to compensate our artists at this rate. The funds raised will be divided among the artists, whether or not we reach our target. Should we surpass the $5,000 mark, additional funds raised will go towards an increased artist fee, and/or a post-production celebration dinner for the artists.</p>
<p><strong>We won't let your contributions go unrecognized.</strong>  For each donation of $25 of more, you earn exclusive perks such as:</p>

<h2>The Man in the Moone</h2>
<p>We are Rhum and Clay.

It will also be the third production we have taken the the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.</p>
<p>The show will be on at the <a href=""http://www.pleasance.co.uk/edinburgh/events/the-man-in-the-moone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pleasance Courtyard</a> which is really exciting for us as the Pleasance is one of the most respected venues for theatre at the Festival.</p>
<p><em>The Man in the Moone </em>tells the story of a man who falls in love with the moon and abandons everyone and everything in his life to get there.</p>
<p>As with all our shows it will be highly physical with a strong emphasis on visual storytelling combined with a playful sense of humour. It will be entirely created by the cast in the rehearsal room. The team involved is:</p>

<p>We're really excited about this show and think it's going to be our best yet. However, to really make the most of the festival for the show and the company, we need your help.</p>
<h3>The Fringe and how you can help</h3>
<p>The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is the biggest arts festival in the world, with over 2800 shows taking place this year and competition is fierce for audiences. However, it is also the best platform for us as a company to showcase our work, not just to audiences, but to important people in the arts industries who flock to the Fringe each year searching out good productions. However, it is also an expensive undertaking and we can't do it alone.</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise <strong>£3000</strong> towards the cost of this project. The money we receive will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Venue Hire</strong></li>
<li><strong>Accommodation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Transport</strong></li>
<li><strong>Publicity and printing costs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We're very grateful for any support you can give us and to say thank you we're pleased to offer some fantastic perks, that range from pin badges to posters, to greetings cards to free tickets to our shows.</p>

He was a man of many trades, but his passion was in the Berwick Theater.  He maintained operation of the Berwick Theater for over 40 years and sold tickets in the ticket booth every night until he fell ill a few months before his death.  </p><p>When my Pop got the news that he had a little over a year to invest in a digital projection system that would run him about $60,000, or he would no longer be able to show new movies, he didn't quit.  At the ripe age of 88 years old, my grandfather actively pursued his options.  Even in my Pop's last moments, the Berwick Theater wasn't far from his mind.  It was literally his dying wish to keep the doors open at the Berwick Theater.</p><p><strong>We must convert to digital or we will be forced to turn the lights out forever.</strong></p><p>Movies have been produced on film for the last 100 years, but 35mm film is becoming a thing of the past. As the world changes technology is booming. Hollywood has made the decision to convert to digital format for movie distribution.  In a little less than a year film distribution from all major production companies will be in digital format. Film projection systems will finally meet their long awaited fate and become obsolete.</p><p><strong>The good and the bad</strong>. </p><p>The good news is that Hollywood did this to dramatically lower the costs of production and distribution, which will ultimately lower our costs. It also means that we will have a much more efficient way of showing movies. No more sound pops, scratched films, missing frames, splicing, bad sound, and shaking. The picture will be sharper, the sound will be phenomenal, and we will have a lot more freedom and opportunity with our movie choices.  </p><p>To ""go digital"", means the picture and sound quality will be amazing.  The system itself will be much more energy efficient.  For instance, there will no longer need 2,000 watt bulbs to shine through the film strip.  Sounds perfect, right? Unfortunately the bad news is that this new upgrade will cost upwards of $60,000. The equipment to upgrade the sound system alone, while very cutting edge, is very expensive. Many small town single screen movie theaters have already shut their doors because the upgrade is too costly. The film studios have offered multiplex theaters substantial discounts to make the conversion to the digital projection system, but independent theaters like ours have not been offered such an opportunity.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p><p><strong>A little history</strong>.  </p><p>The actual structure of the Berwick Theater goes back a long way.  It was originally built and maintained by the Patriotic Order Sons of America for it's intended use as an Opera House.  In the 1910's it was renamed the Lyric and later it became the Palace.  It's believed that it was being operated as a playhouse at that time. Records show that it was the Strand in the 1920's-1930's and operated as a movie theater.  Our patrons tell of silent movies and later popular titles like “Stowaway” with Shirley Temple.  </p><p>In 1937 there was a devastating fire, but it seems that the Strand was more fortunate than it's neighboring play house.  In 1969 major renovations were made to the theater.  It was those renovations that the Berwick Theater still very much resembles.  The whole project included fire proof walls, state of the art technology for it's time, the infamous BIG screen and many other upgrades that cost upwards of $90,000 at that time.  My grandfather purchased the Berwick Theater in 1971 and has had it ever since.  He leased it for a number of years but resumed control in 1997 and maintained it until his death in July 2013.</p><p>Though changes have been made to the theatre over the years, it still exudes a certain character that's unique to small town theatres such as this one.  It's a charming theater that resonates history with every turn, from it's cast iron exit signs, art deco theater seats, to it's original classic aisle lighting.</p><p><strong>Low-cost Entertainment.</strong>  </p><p>My grandfather was proud to provide low cost, family friendly entertainment to his community. He insisted that prices never exceed the already low $4 admission fee. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Sine I've taken over the </span>responsibilities<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> of the Berwick Theater, I've only raised prices that I absolutely had to.  The Berwick Theater is a low-cost, family friendly source of entertainment that I believe is important to this community.  </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The theater acts as an anchor for the downtown business community the same way that a multiplex attracts shoppers to a mall. It is part of the character and vitality of the town. If the theater is forced to go dark part of the attraction of  downtown Berwick will be lost along with it.<br/></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Berwick Theater doesn't bring in a profit, and hasn't for a long time.  Every cent that comes out of the Berwick Theater, goes right back into it.  My pop never cared about a big profit, he just did what he had to keep the lights on.  I don't intend to change any of that.  The more profit we bring in, the more money we can put back into the theater.</span></p><p><b>What's in the future if we can make the conversion? </b></p><p>Well, when I look into my crystal ball, I see endless opportunities.  If we raise more than our goal, we intend to make some much needed upgrades.  Even if we don't exceed our goal, I anticipate that the options that come with a digital system will draw a bigger crowd, leaving us with a bigger profit to put back into the theater.  </p><p>We will be able to show indie films, and hopefully launch our very first indie film festival. We will be able to show old movies and family classics.  I am hoping to live stream bands, host plays and comedy acts, and maybe even invite a group to put on a Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I also see the Berwick Theater being a phenomenal wedding venue, and a source for community events.  I want to be as involved with the community as possible!  Going digital is the first step.</p><p><b>So how do you know I can do this?</b> </p><p>As a 22-yearold newlywed, fresh of out college, I'm ready to take on this task with a fresh new perspective.  I've opened up the task to the community and have welcomed their input.  I am not alone on this task.  My family (new and old) has been so supportive and incredibly helpful.  The community has given us an absolutely overwhelming response.  </p><p>There are two major reasons why I won't give up on this theater.  The first is one of the last things that my grandfather said to me, before he passed away.  My Pop said to me: ""Renee, how I am I going to keep the theater open?""  ""I have to make that digital conversion"".  I gave my Pop my word that I would continue his legacy, and I truly believe that's what let him rest.  </p><p>I will not give up this battle without my best effort.  The second reason I won't give up, is because of the absolutely incredible response that my family and I received when I let our Facebook followers know about the passing of my grandfather.  Berwickians from all over, came forward to let us know that they had our back if we were to continue with the Berwick Theater.  So many people knew my grandfather and his infamous stories.  It's been 6 months, and I'm still constantly receiving sympathies for my pop's passing, and kind words about what a great man he was.  That's why I won't give up on this place. </p><p>So now the question is: Do you support the Berwick Theater? Even if you can't contribute financially please join us on facebook and share the link to this campaign. Maybe stop by the theater and take in a movie some night. I know you will enjoy yourself!</p><br/></div>","Allow me to introduce myself..My name is Renee DiAugustine-Bower and I currently maintain operations of the Berwick Theater.  I took over this responsibility when my grandfather passed away last summer. My grandfather, Vincent DiAugustine, was a legend in the small town of Berwick, PA.

If the theater is forced to go dark part of the attraction of  downtown Berwick will be lost along with it.The Berwick Theater doesn't bring in a profit, and hasn't for a long time.  Every cent that comes out of the Berwick Theater, goes right back into it.  My pop never cared about a big profit, he just did what he had to keep the lights on.  I don't intend to change any of that.  The more profit we bring in, the more money we can put back into the theater.What's in the future if we can make the conversion? Well, when I look into my crystal ball, I see endless opportunities.  If we raise more than our goal, we intend to make some much needed upgrades.  Even if we don't exceed our goal, I anticipate that the options that come with a digital system will draw a bigger crowd, leaving us with a bigger profit to put back into the theater.  We will be able to show indie films, and hopefully launch our very first indie film festival. We will be able to show old movies and family classics.  I am hoping to live stream bands, host plays and comedy acts, and maybe even invite a group to put on a Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I also see the Berwick Theater being a phenomenal wedding venue, and a source for community events.  I want to be as involved with the community as possible!  Going digital is the first step.So how do you know I can do this? As a 22-yearold newlywed, fresh of out college, I'm ready to take on this task with a fresh new perspective.  I've opened up the task to the community and have welcomed their input.  I am not alone on this task.  My family (new and old) has been so supportive and incredibly helpful.  The community has given us an absolutely overwhelming response.  There are two major reasons why I won't give up on this theater.  The first is one of the last things that my grandfather said to me, before he passed away.  My Pop said to me: ""Renee, how I am I going to keep the theater open?""  ""I have to make that digital conversion"".  I gave my Pop my word that I would continue his legacy, and I truly believe that's what let him rest.  I will not give up this battle without my best effort.  The second reason I won't give up, is because of the absolutely incredible response that my family and I received when I let our Facebook followers know about the passing of my grandfather.  Berwickians from all over, came forward to let us know that they had our back if we were to continue with the Berwick Theater.  So many people knew my grandfather and his infamous stories.  It's been 6 months, and I'm still constantly receiving sympathies for my pop's passing, and kind words about what a great man he was.  That's why I won't give up on this place. So now the question is: Do you support the Berwick Theater? Even if you can't contribute financially please join us on facebook and share the link to this campaign. Maybe stop by the theater and take in a movie some night. I know you will enjoy yourself!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

in rehearsals, adults and teens either experience for the first time or are
reacquainted with the impact the subject has had on American and/or world
history.  Emotion is heightened with the
music that was prevalent during respective historical context of the time which
leaves the performers and with a sense of understanding of the subject and the
times in which they lived.  The audience
is always supplied with lyrics to sing along with the cast and we often invite

story of Vertus Hardiman and nine other children who lived in Lyles Station,
Indiana, in the 1920s.   In 1927,
African American families were approached by doctors deliberately misleading
them into thinking that their purpose was to fight a ring worm epidemic. In reality the children were irradiated as
a medical experiment sponsored by the local county hospital.   Vertus Hardiman
c2c intends to invite the
filmmaker to the Missouri History Museum for a screening of the documentary. 
This will require flying him in from Long Beach, CA and paying for hotel
and ground travel.  Readers from c2c as well as volunteers from the community will “read” events from
a timeline listing victims of unethical human experimentation throughout human
history as a prelude to the screening.We need your help to take A Call to
Conscience to the next level!
We  plan to offer
adults, as well as middle and high school students, the opportunity to
experience history through the words of dynamic icons of politics, music,
theater, the civil rights movement and a variety of other platforms. Single
presentations and tailored workshops are designed to meet the Common Core Standards of the English and Language Arts curriculum
set by the Missouri Department of Education.  All workshops end with culminating
performances. 
We need funding to submit our application for
501(c)(3) tax exempt status to make us eligible to apply for grants that will
help retain staff and operating expenses.  What We Need & What You GetBudget:

of our time.

to the development of the concept for the group, Linda serves as Financial
Officer and brings strong program management and fundraising skills to the

experience with several St. Louis theatre companies and writes under the nom de
plume, Loue Chinn. She has been a participant of the Hurston-Wright writing
conferences and is currently she’s scribbling out a novel.The ImpactThe writers, director and performers experience
history as speeches and historical accounts of icons, such as
Nelson Mandela, are adapted to create a “conversation” between the performers
on stage as well as with the audience.  While
in rehearsals, adults and teens either experience for the first time or are
reacquainted with the impact the subject has had on American and/or world
history.  Emotion is heightened with the
music that was prevalent during respective historical context of the time which
leaves the performers and with a sense of understanding of the subject and the
times in which they lived.  The audience
is always supplied with lyrics to sing along with the cast and we often invite
readers to be a part of our program that achieves our objective to be
interactive which  furthers our goal to
bring about transformation and  to be
inspired to become involved with organizations committed to bring about social
change.Our perks offer an opportunity to show your desire to bring about social change through the arts.  We have t-shirts with our c2c logo and key tags in addition to our literary and storytelling talents.  Other Ways You Can Help

<p>We are thrilled that La Mama will be present and house this new show!  We have been working non-stop on refining the script and music and now need to raise the funds necessary for a full production.  This is an amazing opportunity for this show and for us as artists.  We hope that you will come along on this “irresistible” journey with us!</p>
<p>All contributions go towards the production costs, including: sets, lighting, costumes &amp; sound…and are tax deductible! </p>
<p><strong><em>THE SHOW</em></strong></p>
<p>Mr. Irresistible is a sci-fi musical-comedy thriller, set in the mid 1980’s.  Based on Aesop’s fable The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing (Careful What You Wish For), Mr. Irresistible tells the story of a lonely woman who purchases a robotic lover in the hopes of finding happiness and validation in a seemingly cold and heartless world; until she learns that her new “boyfriend” was built to make her fantasies come true, the good and the bad.</p>
<p>When Eileen Morchinsky, a lonely secretary lost in the shuffle of corporate America, the butt of water cooler jokes and living alone in a mouse-infested five-floor walkup, spots an ad for a fully functioning mechanical male companion, she decides to stop reading her romance novels and begin living one. When the exterminator, Joey Bartalucci, shows up to wrangle the rodents in her apartment, she mistakes him for her mail-order groom and a tender relationship is born.  But the couple’s newfound bliss short-circuits when the real Acme Brand Mr. Irresistible finally arrives.</p>
<p>Joey is no match for the seemingly perfect specimen of manhood and quickly finds himself single again, while Eileen finds herself in the arms of the man she’s always dreamed of.  Her Mr. Irresistible comes fully equipped to make her fantasies come true…all of them.  And after complaining about a coworker, who mysteriously winds up dead, Eileen begins to realize what her robotic Romeo is capable of.  Eileen vows to return the hunky purchase and win back her one true love, Joey.  But Mr. Irresistible was made to Eileen’s specifications, and if returned, will be recycled for parts.  When his Artificial Intelligence switches into survival mode, a game of cat-and-mouse ensues, forcing Eileen to make a life or death decision. In that process, she discovers her true voice... and the truth that the love she went searching for has been with her the whole time.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE HISTORY</em></strong></p>
<p>Mr. Irresistible was conceived in 1998.  It was written over the course of a year and given a reading in NYC during 1999.  In 2000 I began working with Richard Frankel on Hairspray, The Musical and Mr. Irresistible was shelved.  When I started the conversation of a residency with ODC (Oberlin Dance Collective), Mr. Irresistible seemed like the obvious choice.  The concepts and structure of the show had already been created, so it would be easy to jump into quickly.  Also, over the decade the subject of robotics and Artifical Inteligence had made it’s way to the forefront of the cultural dialogue.  In many ways it feels like the themes of the show are much more relevant today.</p>
<p>I had meet Chris Winslow the year prior and we had written a number of songs together.  The creative process is very similar for us both, so when the idea of Mr. Irresistible came up, it made perfect sense to collaborate on the project.  This meant keeping the foundation of the show, it’s concepts and characters, but essentially rebuilding it.  The script and songs that make up the current Mr. Irresistible were created in-part during the Creative Artist Residency at ODC in San Francisco, during 2012.  It was given a studio reading mid-point through the residency; and a subsequent theatrical stage reading with full cast and band, on completion of the residency.</p>
<p>During this time I had met with La Mama to debrief after my last show they presented, Project: Lohan.  They invited us to present on their Main Stage in 2013.  It seemed like the perfect trajectory for Mr. Irresistible - to take it to the next phase of the incubation process  It has all moved very quickly for us and this show, but it seems very right.</p>
<p><strong><em>THE TEAM</em></strong></p>
<p>The New York cast includes: Stephen Di Blasi, Cindy Goldfield, Jacquelyn Graham, Chris Hall, Mara Jill Herman, Nicholas Park, Molly Pope, Clayton Dean Smith, and Kirsten Wyatt. </p>
<p>The creative team includes: Music Direction by Seth Weinstein, Choreography by John Paolillo, Costume Design by Dustin Cross, Lighting Design by Wilburn Bonnell. Directed by D’Arcy Drollinger.  Presented by La Mama Etc., Produced by Back It Up Productions, Onemoe Music and Trent Kendall.</p>
<p><strong>D'Arcy Drollinger's</strong> original works include: Project: Lohan, Scalpel!, The Possession of Mrs. Jones, Pink Elephants, Above and Beyond the Valley of the Ultra Showgirls, Suburbia 3000, Shit &amp; Champagne, The Cereal Killers, and the upcoming, Mr. Irresistible.</p>
<p>D'Arcy has also worked as an actor, director, choreographer and producer.  Other credits include: The Producers (first Broadway production), Hairspray the Musical (first Broadway production), F.A.G.G.O.T.S. The Musical, the Thrillpeddler’s revivals of the Cockettes musicals Vice Palace &amp; Hot Greeks, and VH1's Divas 2000 featuring RuPaul.   He directed and co-starred in the stage adaptations of Sex and the City, Designing Women and Roseanne, as well as playing the role of Chrissy Snow in a live version of the TV classic, Three’s Company.  He is a co-founder of Back It Up Productions and Crackers In Bed, INC.  D’Arcy is the creator and resident choreographer for Sunday Skool – every Sunday at the Academy of Ballet – and home of the SF based dance troupe SexiTude!  He is an original member of the critically acclaimed post-punk San Francisco art-rock group Enrique and a firm believer in the ridiculous. Drollinger has been a participant in the BMI Musical Theatre Workshop and is a member of the Dramatists Guild of America.</p>
<p><strong>Christopher Winslow</strong> is currently serving as Music Director for ""The Fourth Messenger"" by playwright Tanya Shafer that will play at the Ashby Stage in Feburary of 2013.</p>
<p>Christopher Winslow recently composed and music directed for Playground SF which was presented at Berkeley Rep.  He worked with SF playground the previous year, and both years his compositions were selected for the “Best of Playground Series” which plays at the Brick House in Potrero Hill.  In 2011, Chris composed and music directed an original full-length musical comedy called “OMFG! The Internet-dating Musical” which ran at ODC  Theater.  He received a grant from the Zellerbach Family Foundation to support this work.  His work on “The Lily’s Revenge” brought Taylor Mac’s piece to life at The Magic Theatre.  He served as assistant MD for “Jerry Springer:The Opera” with Ray of Light Theater which played at the Victoria Theater in San Francisco.  Chris has worked on several projects at the San Francisco School of the Performing Arts, The Spindrift School of the Performing Arts and SF Arts Ed.  His composing projects have included a full-length chamber opera “Gaveston, Favorite of the King” written with playwright Ken Prestinizi who received an Individual Artist Grant from the San Francisco Arts Commission and was produced in concert in San Francisco and in Los Angeles in a full production at Celebration Theatre.  A musical adaptation of “Peer Gynt” commissioned by U.C.

HELL RIGHT.<br/><br/>That said - our Indiegogo costs HAVE increased by about $400 from our last show. We don't have to rent space-coolers this time, but we're paying ~$333 more to buy even sweeter EXCLUSIVE MERCH for you to get from this campaign.

Also, we've allocated $200 more to our staff to add additional personnel.<br/><br/>Some of the cool things your donations have let us do include:<br/> </p><ul>
<li><p>Art and design. We have an extremely talented team of designers who transform the venue into an art piece by using garbage. 4th Tap was turned into an UNDEAD PIRATE SHIP by their selfless capable hands. Though most of our resources are scavenged from trash bins and thrift stores, filling a venue of our size with cool decorations—and the storage to keep them preserved show after show!—costs money.</p></li>
<li><p>Emergency Precautions. We're paying for the services and equipment of EMTs—now that we’re well over a thousand attendees strong, we want to make sure no catastrophe prevents Trve Kvlt Party Violence.</p></li>
<li><p>Safe space/security: PWR is a party for everyone. Our performers have always followed anti-sexist/homophobic/transphobic/racist guidelines, and we wanted to make sure that comfort extends to our audience. We’re proud of our security phone line. Any member of the audience may use this number to report gross behavior at the show, and we resolve the problem, no questions asked. Your support lets us keep reaching toward a goal of ULTIMATE PARTY VIOLENCE for everyone.</p></li>
<li><p>Paying artists. Capitalism is whatever, but we work hard to make sure everyone who contributes art gets some money in exchange—whether our art team, our powerful tech wizards, or our video crew.</p></li>
<li><p>Projection and lighting. Huge audiences compel us to try to use every part of our venue—so that all audience members can find a comfortable view of the show. We’ve found a ton of bargain-barrel prices on new lights, new projector equipment, and new mounts. WINTER WONDERSLAM III will be our best-looking show yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Profit sharing: Our performers literally put their lives on the line FOR FREE. Everyone performs for PWR out of pure love. However, if we EXCEED our Indiegogo total, we combine that with profit from our sales at the merch table. After meeting any additional costs we've incurred, we invest 20% back into PWR and then split the rest among all our staff who worked on the show. We give performers a ""double share"" of this profit sharing in order to reflect their artistic contribution.</p></li>
<li><p>Training: Party Violence is its own unique sport. We have crafted a training program that makes use of experienced pro-wrestling coaching to help keep our PARTY ATHLETES smooth n' safe.  </p></li>

For our last show, your support allowed us to board a sunken ship and meet ghost pirates, floating skeletons, cool fish, and seaweed! Over a thousand people screamed and raised their fists as a burly Nova-Scotian hurled a corporate raider against the beertanks. We drank, we partied, we freaked out and came together in a celebration of absurdist theater - the fellowship of TRVE KVLT PARTY VIOLENCE!PWR was started in a backyard by a small group of friends. It's grown far more than we ever thought it would. We continue to do a DIY show that is all-ages and free to the public, even as costs increase. This is directly owed to you - the Multiverse. We consider everyone who has come to our shows and supported us to be part of PWR. Your continued support allows our core ethos to flourish. It means so much to us - and we pledge to put everything we have into making the most fun event you will attend all winter. What do we have in store for PWR's 10th (!) Party? Hellsport, an evil and probably-supernatural corporation has begun drilling DEEP UNDERGROUND in search of arcane artifacts. They've discovered ICE CAVES - and their meddling threatens the lair of our precious MOTHER WORM! She even appears to be getting sick, and not eating the corrupt businessmen we feed her!

<p>City Dance Live is an online dance studio featuring classes taught by legends, leaders and rising stars in the global dance community. The site is being created by Sandy Lee and Miles Pineda-Kenedi. Sandy is the owner of City Dance Studios in San Francisco and co-owner of Momentum Design and Photography. Miles is a renowned Bboy and a member of Renegade Rockers. He is also a popular Bboy instructor in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>We have been working on this project since June of 2010 and have depleted our resources so we are trying to raise money with Indiegogo to help with the programming of the site. We are extremely close to being ready to launch. We need to raise $5,000 to finish with this phase. If our campaign is very succesful, and we hope it is, we will purchase new computers so that we can speed up all the editing that we do every week.</p>
<p>Our goal with City Dance Live is to provide a platform to connect our world class instructors with anyone, anywhere, anytime who wants to watch, learn and be entertained. We are based out of San Francisco and currently film all of our classes at City Dance Studios. </p>
<p>Another goal of this venture is to help the remarkable dancers in our global network make a better living from their art. Our instructors are the best in the world at what they do and we think they should be compensated better for reaching this level. </p>
<p>We are starting with over 20 amazing instructors and we hope to open our site up to additional elite dancers and instructors as we build the business. So far, we will be offering classes by Kid David, Les Twins, Roxrite, Jardy Santiago, Yuri Zhukov, Pharside, Krystal Meraz, Percy Aroncillo, Ay Hasegawa, Professor Lock, Ynot, Eddie Styles, Eric Fenn, Jaffar Smith, Ysabelle Capitule, ProfoWon, Ellen Kim, Miles Pineda-Kenedi, Emerson Aquino, Rob Nasty, Carlo Atienza, Rocko Luciano, Bibi Khalili, Dennis Infante, Bgirl Crykit, Bionic, Mr. Wiggles and Laura, Reginal and Deyvron from Criminalz Crew in Paris.</p>
<p>Initially our instructors are mostly associated with hip hop and urban dance but In the future we will be adding classes by instructors from many other dance genres such as ballet, contemporary, jazz, tap etc.</p>
<p>Stage Two of the project will involve bringing many of our classes to our students live. Thank you for exploring our project and we hope you feel inspired to contribute :-) </p>

<h3>About The Play</h3>
<div>
<p>Two
people- who’ve been found on the autism spectrum- find themselves stuck in
clown school to learn social skills. Naomi, a dance prodigy in her twenties,
feels in colors and refuses to wear a clown nose. Cole, a percussion virtuoso,
can recite a complete history of the xylophone, but won’t meet your eyes.
Measured against scales of social competence, they’ll push the boundaries of
compliance to find connection in an isolating world and shatter the complacency
of the nameless faces and disembodied voices running the show.</p>

interested in one thing: making cool shit you want to see. Under the leadership of Artistic Director Abigail Birkett,

Two
people- who’ve been found on the autism spectrum- find themselves stuck in
clown school to learn social skills. Naomi, a dance prodigy in her twenties,
feels in colors and refuses to wear a clown nose. Cole, a percussion virtuoso,
can recite a complete history of the xylophone, but won’t meet your eyes.
Measured against scales of social competence, they’ll push the boundaries of
compliance to find connection in an isolating world and shatter the complacency
of the nameless faces and disembodied voices running the show.

Every summer we host our annual dance showcase and fundraiser, The Sockhop. The Sockhop is the first showcase of its kind dedicated solely to <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">helping dancers build stronger, more meaningful relationships with each other in the community</span>. We believe that strong, united individual dancers is the foundation for a thriving and sustainable hip hop dance community.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This year will be our 6th year hosting the show. </span><span>By creating an entire weekend of activities and events, dancers get an opportunity to learn from their peers, share their dance experiences, and ultimately create life-long bonds through their shared passion for hip hop dance. Not only do participants walk away from The Sockhop with newfound friendships, a sense of accomplishment, and the skills and encouragement to become a better and stronger dancer, they leave with the understanding that they have a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">nationwide network of support</span> for their talent as a dancer.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Additionally,<strong> everyone that is involved with The Sockhop planning are VOLUNTEERS</strong> that donate their time to create an amazing event for the community.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>THE NEED:</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>To make the show a reality this year, we need to raise $1200 to go towards venue rental costs. We really rely on the financial support of our community members to keep the show going so that our fellow dancers can remain inspired and motivated to continue creating beautiful art to share.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Funding The Sockhop is not just about putting on another hip hop dance showcase -- it’s about showing support and appreciation for the individual dancers in the community who donate their time to make the dance community great. It’s about celebrating the artists who CREATE beautiful pieces of art that inspire us to be better.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>ABOUT THE PIECES:</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>""Dance, when you're broken open.<br/>Dance, if you've torn the bandage off.</em><br/><em>Dance in the middle of the fighting.</em><br/><em>Dance in your blood.</em><br/><em>Dance when you're perfectly free.”   ― Rumi</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Every dancer has at one time been told to “leave your drama at the door and just dance,” but every dancer knows how hard it can be to do this. For our concept piece “</span><span>Chains and Confinement</span><span>,” Funkanometry SF will create five mini-vignettes that explore the issues in our lives that bind us, hold us back, hurt us, and confine us through an innovative use of props. We’ll then explore the exact opposite feeling of </span><span>complete freedom</span><span> and create pieces that juxtapose both concepts.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The quote above explains our inspiration in wanting to create this piece. It shows the importance of continuing to dance and create through any situation life throws us. Life isn’t always beautiful and perfect; sometimes it’s dark and depressing. It’s important for dancers (especially young dancers still learning to understand and appreciate the art form) to learn how to explore ALL of their emotions and turn them into something beautiful, through dance.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Through a series of short vignettes, we’ll be exploring the ideas of Constraint vs. Freedom:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Vignette 1:<strong> ""</strong></span>The Box"", which we’ll dance inside of to represent being confined, or “boxed in” - Choreographed by <strong>Rocko Luciano</strong>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Vignette 2:</span> ""Rope"", to physically chain our hands together in helplessness - Choreographed by <strong>Emerson Aquino </strong>and various other choreographers</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Vignette 3:</span> ""Blinded"", to represent those times when we’re lost  - Choreographed by <strong>Ramsey Magana &amp; Allyson Liu</strong>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Ending ""Freedom"" </span>- Led by <strong>Emerson Aquino,</strong> choreographed by multiple people, including a piece by guest choreographer, Austin Fernandez</li>
</ul><p dir=""ltr""><span><strong>The final pieces will be debuted at The Sockhop Dance Showcase on Saturday, July 6, 2013.</strong> With your financial support, we can make this show, and our new dance pieces a reality! Please help us spread the word and create a movement to support the dancers in our community!</span></p>

The Sockhop is the first showcase of its kind dedicated solely to helping dancers build stronger, more meaningful relationships with each other in the community. We believe that strong, united individual dancers is the foundation for a thriving and sustainable hip hop dance community.
This year will be our 6th year hosting the show. By creating an entire weekend of activities and events, dancers get an opportunity to learn from their peers, share their dance experiences, and ultimately create life-long bonds through their shared passion for hip hop dance. Not only do participants walk away from The Sockhop with newfound friendships, a sense of accomplishment, and the skills and encouragement to become a better and stronger dancer, they leave with the understanding that they have a nationwide network of support for their talent as a dancer.  
Additionally, everyone that is involved with The Sockhop planning are VOLUNTEERS that donate their time to create an amazing event for the community.
THE NEED:
To make the show a reality this year, we need to raise $1200 to go towards venue rental costs. We really rely on the financial support of our community members to keep the show going so that our fellow dancers can remain inspired and motivated to continue creating beautiful art to share.
Funding The Sockhop is not just about putting on another hip hop dance showcase -- it’s about showing support and appreciation for the individual dancers in the community who donate their time to make the dance community great. It’s about celebrating the artists who CREATE beautiful pieces of art that inspire us to be better.
ABOUT THE PIECES:
""Dance, when you're broken open.Dance, if you've torn the bandage off.Dance in the middle of the fighting.Dance in your blood.Dance when you're perfectly free.”   ― Rumi
Every dancer has at one time been told to “leave your drama at the door and just dance,” but every dancer knows how hard it can be to do this. For our concept piece “Chains and Confinement,” Funkanometry SF will create five mini-vignettes that explore the issues in our lives that bind us, hold us back, hurt us, and confine us through an innovative use of props. We’ll then explore the exact opposite feeling of complete freedom and create pieces that juxtapose both concepts.
The quote above explains our inspiration in wanting to create this piece. It shows the importance of continuing to dance and create through any situation life throws us. Life isn’t always beautiful and perfect; sometimes it’s dark and depressing. It’s important for dancers (especially young dancers still learning to understand and appreciate the art form) to learn how to explore ALL of their emotions and turn them into something beautiful, through dance.
Through a series of short vignettes, we’ll be exploring the ideas of Constraint vs. Freedom:


Vignette 1: ""The Box"", which we’ll dance inside of to represent being confined, or “boxed in” - Choreographed by Rocko Luciano


Vignette 2: ""Rope"", to physically chain our hands together in helplessness - Choreographed by Emerson Aquino and various other choreographers

Vignette 3: ""Blinded"", to represent those times when we’re lost  - Choreographed by Ramsey Magana & Allyson Liu


Ending ""Freedom"" - Led by Emerson Aquino, choreographed by multiple people, including a piece by guest choreographer, Austin Fernandez
The final pieces will be debuted at The Sockhop Dance Showcase on Saturday, July 6, 2013. With your financial support, we can make this show, and our new dance pieces a reality! Please help us spread the word and create a movement to support the dancers in our community!

<h2><strong>SOUND FOOTING Spring 2013 Fundraiser<br/></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>for Sound Theatre Company<br/></strong></h2>
<p><strong>SOUND THEATRE COMPANY</strong> presents highly theatrical work inspired by language and music while showcasing professional and emerging talent in the Seattle area.</p>
<p>Since our first production in 2006, we have steadily produced quality, literate work that is accessible to a broad audience, fueled by the passion and contributions of our company artists.</p>
<p>Our ""Sound Footing"" fundraising campaign aims to establish financial stability for our 2013 season, and to continue creating work that demonstrates the importance and beauty of language and music.</p>
<h3>Our 2013 Season</h3>
<p>We have announced two works for Sound Theatre Company's 2013 season, both to be performed at the Center Theatre at the Seattle Center Armory:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Dogg's Hamlet/Cahoot's Macbeth by Tom Stoppard, June 6-23, 2013</strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
<div style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 30px;"">
<span>Tom Stoppard</span><span> </span><span>(<em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead</em>) uses the Bard's classics to explore the nature of language, censorship and the importance of free expression. In <em>Dogg's Hamlet</em>, English schoolboys who speak the language of ""Dogg"" encounter a befuddled English-speaking delivery man as they prepare for their school production of <em>Hamlet</em>. In <em>Cahoot's Macbeth</em>, renegade actors in cold-war Czechoslovakia continue their private performance of <em>Macbeth</em> under the eyes of a police inspector who suspects them of subversion against the state. Artistic Director Teresa Thuman directs both plays, in which Stoppard's smart, witty and gleeful word-play illuminates the power language has in our world.<span> </span> Appropriate for all audiences.</span>

<br/><p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>The Wild Party, book, lyrics and music by Andrew Lippa, August 8-25, 2013</strong><em><br/></em></p>
<div style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 30px;""><span>Sound Theatre Company presents the Seattle premiere of <em>The Wild Party</em>, with book, music and lyrics by Andrew Lippa, based on the 1928 epic poem by Joseph Moncure March about the excesses of the Jazz Age.  A group of burlesque performers join together for a wild, erotic evening in a Manhattan apartment that will push the limits of their decadent and thrill-seeking high living. Corey McDaniel directs this provocative staging with music direction by Kim Dare, choreography by Jessica Low and features the physical and vocal talents of an ensemble of young professional musical theatre artists. For mature audiences: contains very adult situations.</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need and Where it Goes</h3>
<p>We need to raise at least $7,500 toward our 2013 goal (ultimately, of $20,000). This sum is in addition to ticket sales, which typically cover only about half of total production expenses. <strong>Every amount helps, no matter how small!</strong></p>
<p>Sound Theatre Company produces professional work on very modest budgets. Our largest production expenses are for rental of performance and rehearsal space, royalties, and material for scenery and costumes.</p>
<p>Sound Theatre Company is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, so all of your donations are tax-deductible.</p>

Story<p></p></span></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;"">Rosie Thorn is a character that was born out the devised theatre
piece 'The Powder Room' based on Carol-Ann Duffy's poem 'Warming the Pearls'.
The company that I was involved in at the time took this play to Edinburgh
Fringe Festival in 2006. </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;""> </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;"">Since then the character of Rosie has evolved from a girl into a
grown up 1950's housewife with aspirations to perfection and tendencies towards
the macabre. I have performed Rosie on the London cabaret circuit before
writing a full-length script that follows her antics in the Village of
Featherington-On-The-Wold. </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;""> </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;"">After performing the show at a comedy festival and receiving
very positive feedback I decided to take the show to Edinburgh Fringe Festival,
with aspirations of it being taken on tour. I have put together a
very professional and competent team, a marketing manager, PR agent and
technician that all believe in the show and it's potential. We have a great
Central venue in Edinburgh which is vital for bringing in audience and
press. </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 3.75pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 3.75pt; margin-left: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;""> </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 3.75pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 3.75pt; margin-left: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;""> </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<h3 style=""margin-top: 9.95pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 9.95pt; margin-left: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;"">The
Impact<p></p></span></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;"">The idea behind the Rosie Thorn campaign is that the show will
make an impact in Edinburgh, gaining covering in both local and national media,
including press, television and radio. </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;""> </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;"">Managers and bookers will see the show and the Rosie team will
push towards being booked firstly for a national tour in the UK, with a view to
it being taken to the U.S. </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;""> </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #4D4D4D;"">If the full amount is not raised then taking Rosie to Edinburgh
will still go ahead, but it will have to be done on a much smaller budget. This
would mean that eye catching 'press calls' such as Rosie on a big cupake would
not be possible. It is important that as a small team we are creative and think
about ways to stand out from all the other performers at the festival. The
competition is high as Edinburgh Fringe Festival is the largest arts festival
in the world.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

</div></div>","Our
Story
Rosie Thorn is a character that was born out the devised theatre
piece 'The Powder Room' based on Carol-Ann Duffy's poem 'Warming the Pearls'.
The company that I was involved in at the time took this play to Edinburgh
Fringe Festival in 2006. 
 
Since then the character of Rosie has evolved from a girl into a
grown up 1950's housewife with aspirations to perfection and tendencies towards
the macabre. I have performed Rosie on the London cabaret circuit before
writing a full-length script that follows her antics in the Village of
Featherington-On-The-Wold. 
 
After performing the show at a comedy festival and receiving
very positive feedback I decided to take the show to Edinburgh Fringe Festival,
with aspirations of it being taken on tour. I have put together a
very professional and competent team, a marketing manager, PR agent and
technician that all believe in the show and it's potential. We have a great
Central venue in Edinburgh which is vital for bringing in audience and
press. 
 
 
The
Impact
The idea behind the Rosie Thorn campaign is that the show will
make an impact in Edinburgh, gaining covering in both local and national media,
including press, television and radio. 
 
Managers and bookers will see the show and the Rosie team will
push towards being booked firstly for a national tour in the UK, with a view to
it being taken to the U.S. 
 
If the full amount is not raised then taking Rosie to Edinburgh
will still go ahead, but it will have to be done on a much smaller budget. This
would mean that eye catching 'press calls' such as Rosie on a big cupake would
not be possible. It is important that as a small team we are creative and think
about ways to stand out from all the other performers at the festival. The
competition is high as Edinburgh Fringe Festival is the largest arts festival
in the world.
 
 
What We
Need & What You Get
Altogether we are looking for a total figure of  £15,000  this figure will
allow us to make a good impact.
 
We are investigating other routes of sponsorship in addition to
Indiegogo, such as corporate sponsors with a vested interest in the project.
 
Financial Breakdown:
Venue = £2,400
Edfringe brochure = £300
Travel costs = £500
Accommodation = £3,200
Disposable props = £300
Props = £500
Marketing Support = £2,000
PPL Licence = £100
Posters and Flyers = £2,000
Expenses = £800
Printing Costs = £500
PR Costs = £2,500
 
As previously stated without funding it would not be possible to
have a PR Agent and all the things that go with that, I would also would not be
able to cover accommodation costs for the team. I would have to find a way to
fund all the other elements.

<h3>If you know me (hi Mom!), you know I've been working hard these past two years and accomplished some great stuff (if I do say so myself)...</h3>
<ul>
<li>I've choreographed two stage works and am about to finish my third.</li>
<li>I've performed my stage work in festivals in Santa Barbara, Pasadena, and Chicago. </li>
<li>I created <i>CRIT, </i>a series of free informal showings of new works and works-in-progress by local performing artists followed by a critique by the audience, so far sponsoring performances by eleven Santa Barbara area performance artists.</li>
<li>I created my first site-specific dance for the Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara's <i>Shift, Stretch, Expand: Everyday Transformations</i> exhibition.</li>
<li>I collaborated with artists Shannon Willis and Marco Pinter on a multi-media site specific work for the LightWorks Isla Vista Festival.</li>
<li>I was honored to receive the first annual Excellence In Choreography award for emerging choreographer from the Santa Barbara Independent.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check out more about my work and what I've been doing on my website at <a href=""http://www.wesliechingdance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.wesliechingdance.com</a></p>
<h3>Cool! So what's next?</h3>
<p>My first evening-length performance! I'll be showing my previously choreographed stage works <i>You (Or Someone Like You)</i> and <i>We Are Made Of Stars</i> along with the premiere of part one of my new work, <i>The Entirety Of Us.</i> I'll also be hosting friends and fellow dance artists Jessica Kondrath and Robin Bisio as they share some of their new work.</p>
<h3>Nice Wes...so where do I come in?</h3>
<p>To make this show a reality, I need to raise...</p>
<h2>$2,500!</h2>
<p>(dun, dun, dun)</p>
<h3>Here's what I'll use it for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>$1000 - Rental of Center Stage Theater on October 1, 2016 </li>
<li>$750 - Payment to five dancers for this one-night performance</li>
<li>$500 - Costumes and set pieces for my dances</li>

I've choreographed two stage works and am about to finish my third.
I've performed my stage work in festivals in Santa Barbara, Pasadena, and Chicago. 
I created CRIT, a series of free informal showings of new works and works-in-progress by local performing artists followed by a critique by the audience, so far sponsoring performances by eleven Santa Barbara area performance artists.
I created my first site-specific dance for the Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara's Shift, Stretch, Expand: Everyday Transformations exhibition.
I collaborated with artists Shannon Willis and Marco Pinter on a multi-media site specific work for the LightWorks Isla Vista Festival.
I was honored to receive the first annual Excellence In Choreography award for emerging choreographer from the Santa Barbara Independent.

You can check out more about my work and what I've been doing on my website at www.wesliechingdance.com
Cool! So what's next?
My first evening-length performance! I'll be showing my previously choreographed stage works You (Or Someone Like You) and We Are Made Of Stars along with the premiere of part one of my new work, The Entirety Of Us. I'll also be hosting friends and fellow dance artists Jessica Kondrath and Robin Bisio as they share some of their new work.
Nice Wes...so where do I come in?
To make this show a reality, I need to raise...
$2,500!
(dun, dun, dun)
Here's what I'll use it for:

$1000 - Rental of Center Stage Theater on October 1, 2016 
$750 - Payment to five dancers for this one-night performance
$500 - Costumes and set pieces for my dances
$250 - Miscellaneous production expenses such as posters and programs.

That's the nitty gritty friends. Thanks for reading this far.

<p>On Monday, May 14th, the rehearsal space we shared with well-loved Seattle band The Bad Things burned to the ground destroying all the equipment inside. The other bands lost pretty much everything they had, while we were much luckier losing only our collection of microhones, cords and stands.</p>
<p>This equipment is desperately needed for us to perform our shows at the Can Can on May 24th and June 28th. Anything our friends and family can do to help us out would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Any amount will help us achieve this goal, and if by some miracle we raise more than we need to replace our equipment, the extra funds will be invested in creating some merchandise, building our Halloween Show, recording, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Normally bands offer some great rewards of CD's or t-shirts, but unfortunatley we don't have those things yet so we have had to be creative.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance!</p>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p>This is a student run event. We have been working tirelessly all year putting together the costumes for shows as well as our own individual projects and this is our opportunity to showcase what we have achieved and promote ourselves and our talents to industry professionals and also our friends and family. This even and in particular our Grad Show exhibition are our contribution to the University's Arts Festival - Platform 4.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</h3>
<p>Staging an event and putting together gallery exhibitions is an expensive business, here's what your money will go towards.</p>
</div><ul>
<li><p><strong>Buying materials for the exhibition. </strong>To display our work in all it's glory we will need to purchase boards and card to mount designs on to, frames to put work in the performance spaces and also labels and printing to credit individuals and explain the context of works.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Printing.</strong> We will need to market the event using posters and flyers which can be expensive to print. Also our exhibition yearbook containing photos and biographies of what we have been up to this year and over the course of our time at university.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paying technical staff. </strong>The performance needs to be lit and have music/sound to exhibit our costumes in a true theatre setting so we will require technical staff to do this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hiring additional equipment. </strong>We want to hire projectors to inform the audience about what is on the runway and who's work it is, in previous years this has been a very successful element of the show however it is also one of the biggest expense. We may need to hire additional lights and other technical equipment.</p></li>
</ul><p>This event is coordinated by us the students however we can only achieve so much without additional technical staff and equipment. Please donate and spread the word to help us to make <strong>Costume Showcase 2017 </strong>the biggest and best it's ever been!</p><div><h3> </h3></div><div>

<p><strong>(Mental Health: The Facts &amp; Hard Truths)</strong></p>
<p>Northern Ireland has the highest levels of mental illness in the UK, more than any other region, with a reported 25% higher overall prevalence compared to England. 1 in 3 people here will suffer from mental health illnesses compared to 1 in 4 in the rest of the UK. Mental Illness is the biggest cause of disability in Northern Ireland yet out of a £4.9bn budget; only £225m is spent on mental health here.  Studies have shown that 75% of mental illness problems begin before the age of 18, 50% take root before turning 15 and in recent years up to 10% of school children will be diagnosed with a mental health illness - in a class of 30, that’s 3 children suffering.  Statistics show that the UK and Ireland’s mental health problems are rising and developing at a younger age.  In all of those cases, only 25% of young people are receiving treatment and 75% of people are not receiving any treatment at all. In the UK and Northern Ireland suicide is the biggest killer of young people.  We need to start talking about mental health, we need to create safe spaces for people to be informed and comforted.</p>
<p><strong>(What is SHARKTANK &amp; why should YOU crowdfund US?)</strong></p>
<p>SHARKTANK is a daring and innovative devised performance piece about being a creative in Northern Ireland and the impact that can have on your mental health. It is an empowering piece inspired directly from the cast’s personal experiences in the performing arts community.</p>
<p>SHARKTANK is cathartic, irreverent and self-deprecating. It is an entertaining piece unmasking the “conventions” of the theatre world, which can hinder our ability to put our hand up and say, ‘I feel like I’m being swallowed up’. We don’t want to feel discouraged about our industry - we want to change it. No fancy lighting states, no elaborate stage - just seven individuals sharing their experiences.</p>
<p>SHARKTANK is a melting pot of performance styles; we are a mix of dancers, clowns, performers, actors and musicians. We are experimenting with a combination of art forms to deliver the most authentic and meaningful performance possible.</p>
<p>Performing at the Stockholm fringe is an incredible opportunity; it is one of the leading fringe festivals in the world, producing an exhilarating programme of risk takers across an abundance of art-forms.  We are one of only a few Irish acts to have ever been invited. By bringing SHARKTANK to Stockholm, we are bringing our conversation about mental health to an international audience. By showcasing Irish art on a world stage, we hope to raise the profile of mental health issues and with enough help and support, bring SHARKTANK home and tour the production, and share it with you.</p>
<p>We believe that SHARKTANK needs to be seen. We are creating a better way of communicating with other industry professionals, creatives and those who dedicate their lives to creating art. We want to champion their stories so that anyone who has experienced mental health issues can both join the conversation, recognise that they are not alone, understand that the conversation is happening, and that we want to listen and do something about it.</p>
<p>SHARTANK is a completely non-funded production. The lack of a functioning government in Northern Ireland and the severity of arts funding cuts have made it incredibly difficult for us to reach our goal of performing together in Stockholm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>(What do SHARKTANK need money for?)</strong></p>

<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, please follow our journey and support the SHARKTANK team by sharing our story across social media. If you are in the position to donate, we have a range of perks you can receive, details of which can be found on our crowd funder.</p>
<p>SHARKTANK is bringing awareness, starting a discussion and opening people up to the truth about mental health in Northern Ireland. We want to break down the barriers and let people know that it’s ok to not be ok. Artists supporting artists, people supporting people and now, more than ever, we need your help.

We take inspiration from Gertrude Stein’s writing for and about the theater, and our name comes from one of her plays. Our most recent productions have been <a href=""http://www.polybeandseats.org/history-of-launching-ships/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'><i>A History of Launching Ships (Somewhat After Washington Irving)</i></a> by Avi Glickstein at BLDG 92 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and <a href=""http://www.polybeandseats.org/alice/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Alice, or the Scottish Gravediggers</i></a> by René-Charles Guilbert de Pixérécourt at the Old Stone House of Brooklyn. The members of our company are Jessica Silsby Brater, Catherine Wallach, Miriam Felton-Dansky, Ari Vigoda, Stacey McMath, Avi Glickstein, Elaine O’Brien, Natalie Robin, Sarah Badiyah Sakaan and Lindsay Torrey.</p>
<br/><h3><b>What is <i>Anna Asli Suriyah (I Come from Syria)</i>?</b></h3>
<p><b><font color=""green"">""Habibti, I feel I need to be there.""</font></b><br/></p><p><b>In August, Polybe + Seats will produce a new play conceived by company member Sarah Badiyah Sakaan with artistic director Jessica Silsby Brater at Beit Jeddo Hookah Lounge in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.</b> This is going to be an immersive night of theater, blending real-life moments with fantastical and folktale elements. Beit Jeddo (which means ""Grandfather's House"") will be transformed into a Syrian banquet hall, with the action moving from Aleppo to a refugee camp on the Turkish border to the U.S. and back. Our multi-national, multi-lingual cast presents a show that highlights the difficult choices Syrian and Syrian-American people must make as they grapple with the current crisis, and celebrates the drive to stay connected over great distances and barriers.</p><p>“The inspiration for creating this piece,” says Sarah, “is the fact that I’m in this conversation about what’s going on in Syria with my family, and I can’t escape it when I’m with them - but I am usually by myself in Brooklyn, and I’m able to give myself a little bit of space. With my family, we’ll be having coffee and just casually talking and then something drops in that is really devastating and really current, and everything changes. I realized that as a theater artist I have an opportunity to tell a story that’s not being told, of people who are actually experiencing this thing from the inside out.
</p><p><b>Creating this show with my theater company is a celebration of the power and the freedom I have to tell this story.</b> Instead of denying what’s going on, or disengaging from the conversation, I consider it my responsibility to make this play as an American and as the daughter of an immigrant who left his family to gain access to freedoms he couldn’t have in Syria.”
</p><p>This piece had its first public showing as a solo work-in-progress this past November at Brooklyn Winery - maybe some of you were there! Since then, Sarah and Jessica have been working with a talented team of actors and designers, as well as producer Katie Naka, to shape Sarah’s passionate feelings about the current conflict in Syria into our 13th production. 
</p><p><b>“Collaborating with Sarah on this production is thrilling,” says Jessica. </b>“Her vision combines personal experience and family history with traditional Arabic storytelling, music and ritual to bring an international humanitarian crisis to our attention. Our fantastic production team is making work that is moving, funny, surprising and exciting. We look forward to welcoming audiences!”
</p><p><b><font color=""green"">""<i>Inshallah</i>, <i>badain</i>, in a little while, it will be over, <i>yianni</i>, in a couple of months. You will see.""</font></b></p><br/><h3><b>What we need</b></h3><p>We are proud to say that this project has already received support from the Brooklyn Arts Council and A.R.T./New York’s Nancy Quinn Fund.

We take inspiration from Gertrude Stein’s writing for and about the theater, and our name comes from one of her plays. Our most recent productions have been A History of Launching Ships (Somewhat After Washington Irving) by Avi Glickstein at BLDG 92 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Alice, or the Scottish Gravediggers by René-Charles Guilbert de Pixérécourt at the Old Stone House of Brooklyn. The members of our company are Jessica Silsby Brater, Catherine Wallach, Miriam Felton-Dansky, Ari Vigoda, Stacey McMath, Avi Glickstein, Elaine O’Brien, Natalie Robin, Sarah Badiyah Sakaan and Lindsay Torrey.
What is Anna Asli Suriyah (I Come from Syria)?
""Habibti, I feel I need to be there.""In August, Polybe + Seats will produce a new play conceived by company member Sarah Badiyah Sakaan with artistic director Jessica Silsby Brater at Beit Jeddo Hookah Lounge in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. This is going to be an immersive night of theater, blending real-life moments with fantastical and folktale elements. Beit Jeddo (which means ""Grandfather's House"") will be transformed into a Syrian banquet hall, with the action moving from Aleppo to a refugee camp on the Turkish border to the U.S. and back. Our multi-national, multi-lingual cast presents a show that highlights the difficult choices Syrian and Syrian-American people must make as they grapple with the current crisis, and celebrates the drive to stay connected over great distances and barriers.“The inspiration for creating this piece,” says Sarah, “is the fact that I’m in this conversation about what’s going on in Syria with my family, and I can’t escape it when I’m with them - but I am usually by myself in Brooklyn, and I’m able to give myself a little bit of space. With my family, we’ll be having coffee and just casually talking and then something drops in that is really devastating and really current, and everything changes. I realized that as a theater artist I have an opportunity to tell a story that’s not being told, of people who are actually experiencing this thing from the inside out.
Creating this show with my theater company is a celebration of the power and the freedom I have to tell this story. Instead of denying what’s going on, or disengaging from the conversation, I consider it my responsibility to make this play as an American and as the daughter of an immigrant who left his family to gain access to freedoms he couldn’t have in Syria.”
This piece had its first public showing as a solo work-in-progress this past November at Brooklyn Winery - maybe some of you were there! Since then, Sarah and Jessica have been working with a talented team of actors and designers, as well as producer Katie Naka, to shape Sarah’s passionate feelings about the current conflict in Syria into our 13th production. 
“Collaborating with Sarah on this production is thrilling,” says Jessica. “Her vision combines personal experience and family history with traditional Arabic storytelling, music and ritual to bring an international humanitarian crisis to our attention. Our fantastic production team is making work that is moving, funny, surprising and exciting. We look forward to welcoming audiences!”
""Inshallah, badain, in a little while, it will be over, yianni, in a couple of months. You will see.""What we needWe are proud to say that this project has already received support from the Brooklyn Arts Council and A.R.T./New York’s Nancy Quinn Fund.

<p><strong>SARAH WEBER GALLO (Choreographer/Director)</strong> is originally from Indianapolis, and is currently dancing in her 12th season as a company member of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet, where she has been featured in productions helmed by an array of world-renowned directors and choreographers, including: Fiona Shaw, Julie Taymor, Steven Wadsworth, Mary Zimmerman, Robert Lepage, Andre Serban, Adrian Noble, Benjamin Millipied, Graciella Danielle, Doug Varone, Mark Dendy, Ben Wright, and Christopher Wheeldon.<span>  Additionally, Sarah has danced for Donald Byrd/The Group, NeoLabos Dancetheatre, Sean Curran Company, The Radio City Rockettes, and Margo Sappington’s American Dance Machine for the 21<sup>st </sup>Century.  She has enjoyed a long and fruitful collaboration with dance maker Elke Rindfleisch, for whom she has served as assistant choreographer/co-creator of numerous dance/theater works performed in venues ranging from rooftops in Brooklyn to Das Pumpwerks in Berlin to Jacob’s Pillow.  Her original choreography has been shown in both concert and theatrical settings at The Ohio Theatre, Gina Gibney, Movement Research, LaMama, Greenspace, Dancemakers Milwaukee, and Indy Convergence.  Sarah holds a B.A. in Psychology from Goucher College, and is an M.F.A. candidate in dance at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee’s Peck School of the Arts, where her recent collaborative choreography with Kate Martel and Whitney Jacobs, <i>Pigeon Congress</i>, will represent UWM at the 2014 American College Dance Festival.</span></p>
<h2>The Project</h2>
<p><i>Much Ado About Cucumbers &amp; Cigars</i> interweaves the narratives of two real women – The Beautiful Cigar Girl and Cucumber Girl – whose stories bare remarkable parallels.  The Beautiful Cigar Girl washed up dead at the mouth of a fresh-water cave in Hoboken, NJ, in 1841, the brutally murdered victim of a botched abortion attempt.  The story of her mysterious death prompted spectacular news reporting during the dawn of the penny press, ultimately resulting in police reform and the criminalization of abortion in New York.  Cucumber Girl is a contemporary young woman, almost certainly a student at Hoboken High School, who is both object and subject of a spate of vulgar and highly sexualized graffiti in the local playgrounds.  The lives of these two young women, spanning the better part of two centuries, illustrates the relentlessness of the commodification of the female body.  </p>
<p>A propulsive rock sound score centered in the Riot Grrrl punk movement provides the musical backbone of the piece, and the narratives are illuminated through spoken and written text.  By juxtaposing empowered female performers with stories of the lives of two real-but-absent women, <i>Much Ado About Cucumbers &amp; Cigars</i> attempts to encourage a little more riotousness toward the purpose of de-objectification of the female body.</p>
<p><em>Much Ado About Cucumbers &amp; Cigars</em> is important to me, because I am motivated<br/>by a desire to place myself and, more importantly, my young daughter outside of<br/>the flat-lined continuum I continue to encounter in today’s post-feminist<br/>world.</p>
<h2>What We Need </h2>
<p>Our total budget:  $4,500</p>
<p>Your support will help me realize this production by financing the technical and design elements, which are integral to the psychological environment of the show. <br/>More importantly, your support will help me compensate the artists, without whom none of this would be possible (or, I could have done a solo show, but the company of these artists makes me so much better). </p>
<p>My work is about presence, about laying bare the people behind the performance.  This requires a great personal investment from the performers.  They don’t just learn steps; they bring their entire selves into the room.  Their generosity is palpable.  </p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>I care about this project because I remember well what it felt like to be a young woman in the world.  And I remember that I couldn’t quite make sense of my emerging womanhood after a girlhood fed by fairytales – Grimm though they may have been.  And I see that young women today are faced with a relentless commodification of their emerging sexual identities.  And I have a young daughter. </p>
<p>So this dance picks away at how young women are to own their power – sexual or otherwise. </p>

<h3>To The Grind</h3>
<p>In a community that is being continually expanded with new modes of ""communicating,"" from Grindr to Scruff to Jackd to Mister to Manhunt to A4A etc., how do we develop our skills of communicating vocally?  What happens to our gay voices when technology starts to take over?</p>
<p>My name is Adriano Cabral.  I am a third year MFA Theatre Performance student at Arizona State University training as an actor and Voice Teacher.  This project I seek to create will explore how members of the gay community develop their voices under the influence of rising technological developments.  I seek to performatively investigate the concept of ""the gay voice"" vocally as well as metaphorically.  </p>
<p><em>To The Grind</em> will put the voice of Gay Identity on the stage.  Overall, I seek to create a discourse in the gay community that brings us closer together and reminds us to remain corporeally present in a digital age.  </p>
<p>Your assistance will help send me to the Purnati Center for the Performing Arts in Bali, Indonesia for an intensive where I will study Fitzmaurice Voicework, Grotowski, Michael Chekhov, Kecak Voicework, Gamelan, Balinese Dance, and Balinese Maskwork in order to hone my craft for effectively creating <em>To The Grind.</em></p>
<p>You will help me create a theatrical event that will awaken a greater awareness of how we communicate in the gay community.</p>

<h3>What are we getting ourselves into?</h3>
<p>The Tuition for the Bali Intensive is $2200</p>
<p>The average flight to Bali is $1500</p>
<p>The time and focus needed to develop a theatrical project is priceless.</p>
<p>Your donation will help me pay the necessary fees for my training and will create peace of mind as I venture off to create this new theatrical event.  In the event that I do not reach my entire goal, the money will still go towards paying off the Bali Tuition.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe that the main reason behind Gay Teen Suicide, Hatemongering, Adverse effects due to unsafe Sex, and other negative ailments on the Gay Community are due to lack of communication.  We need to develop our voices, speak up, and be heard.  Only then can we start destroying the walls that prevent us from living equally.</p>

At the age of ten he auditioned for, and was accepted into, the renown JOFFREY BALLET SCHOOL, (by famed ballerina Irene Hogarth-Cimino) He began his studies in the Young Dancer Program’s “summer intensive”.  There, he studied Ballet Technique for half the day, which was supplemented with classes in Modern, Horton, Flamenco, Broadway, Conditioning &amp; Stretch, and Yoga. He danced 7 hours a day, 5 days a week and excelled. At the end of that life-changing summer and as  a result of the effort, diligence, dedication, sheer athleticism, talent and progression, “MAXIMILIAN was awarded a full scholarship to the prestigious school, by esteemed ballet-mistress, Jo Matos. Since that time, he has performed in three of the JOFFREY BALLET SCHOOL’S productions of, “THE NUTCRACKER SUITE”, and two spring productions, “THE CARNIVAL OF ANIMALS” and most recently “FANTASIA”, in which he danced the role of “THE SORCERER’S APPRENTICE. “MAXIMILIAN” has also been able to maintain a 3.59 GPA while performing, rehearsing and training. He will be profiled in the upcoming November issue of ""LATIN TRENDS MAGAZINE"". A demanding schedule for anyone. Which brings us to the point of our campaign!</p>
<p>          High-achiever that he is, “MAXIMILIAN” was recently accepted into a prestigious college preparatory school enrolling 200 students (mostly working or aspiring child actors and dancers in grades 6-12). </p>
<br/><p>(For the sake of confidentiality and privacy we cannot divulge the name of the school publicly. However, we will furnish the name in private messages upon request.)</p>
<br/><p>       The school was founded in NYC in 1914 to provide an academic education to young people working on the New York stage, ‘vaudeville’, or ‘on the road’. Today’s students include, dancers, musicians,actors, athletes, and others who require the flexibility to pursue challenging goals, that may sometimes require absence from school for professional or pre-professional reasons. In the past, because of his rigorous and demanding schedule of training and performance, there have been conflicts with previous schools. They failed to not only recognize the substance and importance of what “MAXIMILIAN” was doing; but failed to understand a young artist/athlete who operates on an intensely high level. He even had a teacher disparage his talents by stating that’ “Dancer’s are not athletes!” Imagine.</p>
<p>      This school is not that type of school! They are the complete opposite. They are the type of institution that understands and appreciates the young artist and nurtures him.They allow for flexibility for performance, rehearsals, or auditions, without ever sacrificing academic excellence. It is the perfect school for “MAXIMILIAN” however the tuition is quite steep, and we as a family are unable to afford it. </p>
<p>       The tuition is $36,808 per year (plus fees of approximately $1000), bringing the total to $37,808. So we are asking for your assistance,in helping us to raise 50% of the total tuition, which is, $18,904.  This will insure that “MAXIMILIAN” continiues on his journey to becoming one of the youngest trainees in Joffrey Ballet School history; and your contribution would go a long way to helping him to meet and exceed his goal to be a world-class “ballerino” who performs in the capitals of the world.</p>

<p>It was in this volatile aftermath that an impassioned Indian actress, Poorna Jagannathan, reached out to internationally acclaimed playwright and director Yaël Farber to create NIRBHAYA, an evening of theatre that tears away the shame that keeps survivors silent. In NIRBHAYA the play, the rape and death of Jyoti Singh Pandey (“Nirbhaya”) serves as the catalyst for each performer to bravely come forward and break their silence by recounting their own intimate and personal experiences of sexual and gender-based violence. The onstage act of breaking the silence inspires us, the audience and witnesses, to do the same.</p>

broadcasted on local cable. Our aim is to reach as many people as possible, but
as a nonprofit theatre we have fewer resources and a limited reach. The most

WHAT WILL YOUR CONTRIBUTION DO?

The $50,000 we raise will be used to get the NIRBHAYA trailer
broadcasted on local cable. Our aim is to reach as many people as possible, but
as a nonprofit theatre we have fewer resources and a limited reach. The most
effective way for us to advertise the production is on TV- by doing so, we can
mobilize American audiences to stand with NIRBHAYA. 
Our ultimate ambition is to galvanize a broad base of support, with
thousands of people pledging their support of our goal to change the world and
break the cone of silence around sexual violence. 


WHY NOW?
""A
compelling depiction of an awful truth…. Farber’s message is clear; this is a
collective problem and we – men and women – must speak out. ‘I know my silence
is part of what that dark night brought’ says one actor. Silently, some women
in the audience nod” –The Independent ☆☆☆☆☆
“At a time when rape threats have become casual social media currency, it’s intensely sobering to have a play like this that reminds us so viscerally of the real horrors of sexual violence” – Time Out ☆☆☆☆
""One of the most powerful and urgent pieces of human rights theatre ever made."" - The Herald
Now, more than ever, we are compelled to act in the name of NIRBHAYA. We must stand together to break this silence and empower those affected by gender-based violence to speak out worldwide.
