<p><strong>IdealSeat Spring Training - 30 Stadiums, 30 Days</strong></p>
<p>IdealSeat is a mobile and web-based platform that allows fans to become baseball statisticians and collect data about the game and the fan experience.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> Fans download the app (available on iTunes opening day 2013), attend and track all batted balls during the game, and then all data is integrated into heatmaps on the app and our website that show you where the most action is on and off the field, so you can buy a better seat at a lower price.</p>
<p><strong>Why IdealSeat: </strong>Have you ever been at a baseball game and watched as foul ball after foul ball lands in the section next to you? Or on the equivalent section on the opposite side of the stadium? Well, these occurrences are not completely random ... they actually occur due to a range of factors like if the pitcher is a righty or lefty, the speed with which the pitcher throws the ball, and the type of batter in the box.</p>
<p>In some cases, you can literally purchase a seat that is less expensive and have a BETTER chance to catch a foul ball. Nothing is better than coming home with a souvenir from the park, and at some stadiums game-used balls cost $35-100. Why spend all that money when you could spend less, come home with a ball, and have more money to attend more games? <em>IdealSeat gives fans the tools to get into that better seat at a baseball game. </em></p>
<p><strong>How you can join the team:</strong> IdealSeat is driven by fan-collected data. We are only as good as the information we gather. We need Major League talent to download our app (available on iTunes in March), and attend and track games. We’re ready to move beyond Seattle and take the Major League world by storm. When you contribute to the Indiegogo campaign, you help to get us to our first 10 stadiums so we can collect more data and make games better for fans in other cities. <em>Contribute today and help us decide which stadiums to go to next with your votes in the comment section!</em></p>
<p><strong>The perks:</strong> Join a small group of dedicated baseball nuts creating new technology tools for fans. Compete for a chance to have lunch with Major Leaguer Sam Fuld this summer. Receive discounts on tickets. Get one-of-a-kind IdealSeat gear. Check us out on our blog, Facebook, and Twitter.</p>

<p><strong>IdealSeat History:</strong> In Summer 2011, a small group of fans started playing with the concept of our IdealSeat, which we determined as sitting in the sun, drinking a cold beverage and, catch the elusive foul ball. This is also known to many as the Ferris Bueller moment at Wrigley Field – one of the best baseball scenes in any movie.</p>
<p>To achieve Ferris Bueller status, we figured all we needed to do was collect some simple stats that would of course be readily available and create a very simple model that would put us directly into the IdealSeat. Looking back now, I think we all wish it were that simple!</p>
<p>See, it turns out that much of this information is simply not available to the mainstream consumer on MLB, ESPN, Ticketmaster or StubHub, Seatgeek or Fangraphs for that matter. So we needed to do the best thing – create the database.</p>
<p>Starting in September 2011 a small group of us started tracking foul ball locations at Safeco Field…on paper. This turned out to be unbelievably tedious and the simple act of tracking foul balls took hours upon hours for a low quality product. We soon realized that using technology to our advantage would be key and in 2012 we create a mobile app for iPhones and iPads that would allow for collection and analysis in a much more streamlined fashion.</p>
<p>Over the course of 2012, our core team of 9 IdealSeat founders and our research team collected data at nearly every game on foul and fair ball locations. The end result – a robust database of 3,712 data points with all of the information you would ever want on where the action really happens at games.</p>
<p><strong>Where’s your IdealSeat?</strong> Where do you want to be sitting when the ball flies off the bat? How can we make the technology collect the info you need to know?</p>

<p>I want to build a chain of <strong>employee owned urban aquaponic micro farms</strong> in the inner cities of America. Provide fresh, clean food,<em> eliminate farm source pollution, cut the carbon footprint of food,save millions of gallons of fresh water, and create 10,000 decent paying jobs for the worker owners</em>! <strong>YOU ... can help me do this!</strong></p>
<p>You saw the video. I won't bore you with my details except to say, I'm an Organizational Psychologist with 30 years of experience and the best team in the world ready to jump in and make this happen.</p>
<p>We are NOT building big farms. We are building lots of small ones. Our is a distributive food growing model. All our food is LOCAL FOOD! because all our food is grown locally.</p>
<h3><strong>Aquaponics</strong></h3>
<p>This is a 500 year old technology. We are bringing it into the 21st century. It's really simple. We grow fish in tanks ... the fish effluent is filtered and bio digested, then passed through the vegetable growing filed ... the plants filter out what they need, then we refilter and it flows back into the fish. It is a recirculating system and unlike traditional soil farming, we don't cause pollution, we remove it!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Creating a NEW way to grow and distribute food</strong></h3>
<p>This is American innovation ... Grow 12 months a year right in the inner cities, and cut out the costly transportation. Eliminate the long supply lines from Chile, Mexico, and California. It makes no sense to grow lettuce in CA and ship it to DC -- the average head of lettuce travels 1,500 miles from harvest to table. The suits don't want to take a chance on us, even though we have the technology (two patents coming) and the ability. We need to build one first ... and it ain't cheap!</p>

<p>Together, we can change the way food is grown and distributed. Here in America 25 million of us live in food deserts. We can change all that. New jobs, Fresh Clean Food 12 months a year, Millions of Gallons of Clean Water, Elimination of Tons of Pollutants, and 10K New Jobs!</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We need $75,000 to build our first unit and to secure our patents. This will provide bridge funds.

<h3><strong>What Can We Do for You?</strong></h3>
<p>First, we will place a bronze plaque next to the front door of every one of the 400 micro farms we will build with the name of everyone who contributes to us in this campaign. If we do NOT reach our full objective, we will use those funds to start and to raise additional money from socially responsible investors. We will still honor our agreement for the plaque! Everyone, no matter how small the contribution, will be honored. </p>
<p><em><strong>note</strong></em>: Food Discounts will be available only where we have operating aquaponic micro farms.</p>

We could also save your life and that of your family. When there is another crisis, our food supply is at risk because of the long vulnerable supply lines.

<h2>Who we are:</h2>
<p>Howdy and Namaste!</p>
<p>We are The Little Yoga House, a yoga destination just for kids! Located in Austin, Texas, our magical studio/school has a unique yoga curriculum designed to teach toddlers, kids and teens alike the value of having a healthy body, mind and spirit.  We offer a variety of programs from prenatal classes to cool teen workshops – we have something for everyone!</p>
<p>We are organizing fundraisers for our community outreach programs and our Yoga Peace School.  Our community outreach programs will help make yoga accessible to all children. We will offer community classes throughout the week at our studio at a discounted rate and donation-based yoga and art classes that will run multiple times a month, both at our studio and off-site.  All class donations will be put towards a different local children`s charity each month. </p>
<p><span>The Yoga Peace School will be the first yoga school in Austin for kids ages 3-5.  What in the world is yoga school? Our YPS program will provide preschoolers </span>the foundation of a fun yoga practice and the freedom to express themselves creatively through art, dance, theater and music. With an emphasis on social and emotional development, each child will build strength and confidence through partner work and individual activities.  In addition, environmental and cultural awareness is a large component of our curriculum as we take a “journey” around the world. Each week the children will have an art project related to the curriculum and we will use mostly recycled materials to create mindful masterpieces. Our belief of quality over quantity is reflected in our class size, as they are small to give individualized attention to each student.  The aim of the program is to implement healthy holistic habits in a safe, comfortable space filled with hours of pure peaceful fun!</p>
<h2>How will your donation help?</h2>
<p>The funds we raise will help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reach a larger, more diverse student body </li>
<li>Provide scholarships for the Yoga Peace School</li>
<li>Staff our community classes with the best teachers</li>

<p>On Septmeber 11, 2012 due to heavy local rains a 93 year old earthen flood dike broke and flooded over 60 homes in Santa Clara Utah. Many wonderful families were left with damage and destruction that literally came sweeping with a four foot wall of water. The Basso Family was in the middle of this very unexpected flood. Their yard was swept with mud and debri and their basement was flooded. their children lost beds, dressers and clothes due to the deluge. the walls will need to rebuilt and the carpet replaced. The Basso's are a hard working family with six children and they have had some setbacks due to the economy that has affected us all. This flood hit at a time when resources are slim for this family.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are asking for any amount that you can give. We know times are tight for everyone so even a small amount will be appreciated! If many give it can leverage into what is needed. We are asking for a small goal of $5000 even though the rebuild will cost much more. Any money recieved above the needed amount will be paid forward to other neighbors that need it.</p>
<ul>
<li>This funding will go to replace beds, dressers, clothes and needed items for the family.</li>
<li>It wil also be applied to replacing the damaged sheetrock, paint, electrical and carpeting so the family can have their rooms back</li>
<li>If the goal is not reached any amount recieved will be appreciated and applied to the immediate needs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are aware that there are a lot of capaigns for floods. Rest assured that if you give to this camapign that you are helping a family in need. This is truly an opportunity to PAY IT FORWARD! I know the Basso's well and they will truly look for ways to help others in need in the future. Thank you for taking the time to care!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please spread the word about this family in need and invite your friends facebook and other media to give to this worthy cause! Any help is very appreciated!</p></div>","Pay it forward by helping a family in need!

<p>    GFH is designed simply and effectively so that it can be replicated across the country, or even around the world.  The first center will be established in Colorado Springs, CO, as it is a place where homelessness is a large problem.  Many of the homeless in Colorado Springs are veterans who simply are not getting the assistance they need, yet the recession has landed people from all backgrounds in a situation with no place to go.  <br/><br/>    GFH is also set up to help people help themselves, while also helping out their community and becoming a part of it! With your help, we could make a big impact on our social structure and our human family.  Alleviating homelessness will benefit the whole community, and if this center is successful, they can be established everywhere to combat homelessness, poverty and hunger.  With your help, we could make a big difference!</p>

<p>What happens if the goal is not reached for funding?</p>
<p>    If the goal is not reached, money will be used to apply for tax-exempt status, which would allow GFH to apply for certain grants and could allow us to find a fiscal sponsor.  Another fundraiser will be launched shortly after this campaign is over, going to the community of Colorado Springs, where the first center will be set up, in order to raise the funds necessary to get the materials we need to get started.  An online auction will also be held shortly after this campaign ends, so check out our Facebook page for updates!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I am an artist with a dream.  The first step of my dream is to start an in-home daycare.  In order to start that first step I need to make my home into an affordable, child friendly, fun and dedicated environment.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This day care would help out so many families, just in my community alone.  It would create a stable, safe and close to home place for children to wait for Mom and Dad to get home from work.  This would be a great chance, for my husband and I, to start our family and be home for them.  Parents would no longer have to miss work because they could not find someone to watch their little one.  Day or night I would be there for them!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All the funds from this fundraiser would go into the daycare:</p>
<p>concrete blocks, plywood and 2x4's for the walls, mortar and nails to join them all, stucco and paint to make it look nice,  insulation, laminate wood flooring and pebble tile for the hall and room flooring, pocket doors for the closet and room entrance (space saver), a side door and a security screen door (for safety), concrete to extend the driveway up the side of the house so children can ride bikes a 3 wheelers (away from the street), fencing, cables and wiring to run electricity to new outlets, a ceiling fan to help keep them cool, books, toys and bedding ( for their entertainment, learning and nap time), first aid and other supplies ( crayons, paper, safety scissors, glue, children's music- for education and fun) a permit and a handyman to do it all.  I will post pictures so you can see what your help has done!!<br/></p>

Rightfully Sewn will provide seamstress training
for at-risk women so they can thrive in a specialized workforce that will
reestablish Kansas City as an epicenter of garment manufacturing, while at the
same time, propel Kansas City fashion designers to market so they can supply
the burgeoning demand for affordable, high-quality, American-produced garments.

Through market research, we have discovered Kansas City’s at-risk women population needs:
          •To learn a
meaningful trade and gain work experience          •Job placement
assistance with companies that offer livable wages
Kansas City's fashion designers need:
          •Access to space, state-of-the-art fashion technology, and
fabric
          •Assistance with marketing, accounting, manufacturing, and merchandising



A. Empower at-risk women by teaching them a trade and assisting them with job placement, thereby elevating them out of a systemic situation
B. Cultivate fashion designers by providing them access to a designated space, state-of-the-art fashion technology, and staffing resources through competitive designer residencies



The $9,000 we raise will be used for the following:
We are lucky to live in a city, state, and nation
that offer an amazing amount of grants. Help us contract a professional
grantwriter to secure funds for our programs.
We have a beautiful logo and website. Help us
bring the rest of our marketing collateral to life (business cards, letterhead,

We need legal advice and assistance when drawing up agreements in order to run our organization. Help us patronize a local

We're located in the peaceful village of Los Naranjos, Honduras--near Lake Yojoa.</p>
<p>From the day I moved to this small pueblo four years ago, I've driven past a dilapidated outdoor sports area that has a lot of potential but has fallen into disrepair.</p>
<p>Locals have told me that there used to be outdoor basketball leagues, games every night, and even public ceremonies held on this basketball court. </p>
<p>Originally constructed more than 15 years ago by visiting volunteers, it's in such poor shape now that something must be done. The children of Los Naranjos need more space to safely play sports and the rest of the community deserves better than a run-down, tired patch of blight in an otherwise aesthetically-pleasing village.</p>
<p>This time, though, it's important that the community take ownership of the project instead of <u>only soliciting outside help</u>.</p>
<p>Therefore, local businesses have joined together to pledge <b><u>matching donation amounts</u></b> in order to help bring this project to fruition. For every dollar raised here via IndieGoGo, these businesses will match that dollar one-for-one, up to $1,250, for a combined total of $2500. Here is a breakdown of the local business donations:</p>

<li>Because locals use this court both for basketball as well as mini-soccer, we'll be painting the court for multi-use purposes (lines for basketball and for soccer)</li>

that traditional charity has great merit but does not always provide lasting

<h3>
<i>The Way Forward</i>
</h3>
<p>Whatever funds are raised will go towards starting this project in earnest and will allow Smart Globe International to commence operations at a smaller level to implement our vision.  If we do not reach our entire fundraising goal we will scale down and purchase a smaller quantity of coffee and cocoa seeds for the farms.  We will invest in a greater proportion of bio-diversification crop seeds, such as peppers and soybeans, in order to sell those crops and raise money for the future purchase of more coffee and cocoa seeds.   <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440474969/ygefryzfeirosttfewo4.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 628.986px; height: 420px;""/></p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>
<span><span></span></span><i>Road Blocks</i><br/>
</h3>
<p>Our approach to
prevent or fight pests and disease will be a combination of different proven solutions. We will plant disease resistant varieties, such as Java for
Arabica Coffee, plant pepper which repels insects and alternate different varieties
of trees. This alternation and addition to including bio-diversification trees creates a barrier and reduces the spread of pests. Organic spray to fight insect and fungi could be used as well. Shade
control and pruning are other approaches to prevent or limit the risk of
plant diseases that we will use.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Price volatility of both coffee and cocoa is another possible challenge.  By farming both crops we expect to balance any challenges that might arise if the focus was on just one. Coffee and cocoa prices are expected to
increase as demand keeps growing and production keeps dropping.</p>

The Way Forward

Whatever funds are raised will go towards starting this project in earnest and will allow Smart Globe International to commence operations at a smaller level to implement our vision.  If we do not reach our entire fundraising goal we will scale down and purchase a smaller quantity of coffee and cocoa seeds for the farms.  We will invest in a greater proportion of bio-diversification crop seeds, such as peppers and soybeans, in order to sell those crops and raise money for the future purchase of more coffee and cocoa seeds.   


 
   


Road Blocks

Our approach to
prevent or fight pests and disease will be a combination of different proven solutions. We will plant disease resistant varieties, such as Java for
Arabica Coffee, plant pepper which repels insects and alternate different varieties
of trees. This alternation and addition to including bio-diversification trees creates a barrier and reduces the spread of pests. Organic spray to fight insect and fungi could be used as well. Shade
control and pruning are other approaches to prevent or limit the risk of
plant diseases that we will use.



Price volatility of both coffee and cocoa is another possible challenge.  By farming both crops we expect to balance any challenges that might arise if the focus was on just one. Coffee and cocoa prices are expected to
increase as demand keeps growing and production keeps dropping.

<h3>Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p><a href=""http://idealethos.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>IdealEthos</b></a> is unlike other
consulting firms. Our work accelerates the shift from the outdated and singular
focus of profit-driven business models that dominated the 20<sup>th</sup>
century to a more holistic, authentic model that embraces considerations for people, planet <i>and </i>profit now and into the future. </p>
<p>Our services focus first on
customized sustainability assessments and reporting using the<a href=""https://www.globalreporting.org/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Global Reporting Initiative</a>’s framework. These assessments provide a baseline for understanding what a business is already doing well and where it can improve. <b><a href=""http://idealethos.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">IdealEthos</a> </b>can then guide a business through the creation
of programs and initiatives while connecting them more meaningfully
with their communities. IdealEthos is a consulting firm committed to assisting
in the transformation of businesses to sustainable and socially responsible
organizations that thrive on making a profit while working with people in their communities
and reducing impact on the planet.</p>
<p><u>About the Founder:</u></p>
<p><b><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinaceballos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Christina Ceballos</a> </b>has 18 years of
experience working in business, communities and on environmental issues in a variety of fields. She has worked in education, human rights and international
development in the non-profit and government sectors. After finishing two years of service in Peace
Corps in Mali, West Africa in 2007, she moved to Austin. </p>
<p>Since, she has co-founded an
environmental education nonprofit and worked for an international environmental
advocacy organization. While working toward her master’s degree in Organizational
Leadership and Ethics in the school of business at St. Edward’s University, she
saw enormous untapped potential for businesses in the realm of corporate social
responsibility. The key to unlocking this potential and shifting it from a
purely public relations and marketing perspective to being an effective vehicle for
transforming business is organizational learning and authentic, deliberate
action.</p>

IdealEthos is unlike other
consulting firms. Our work accelerates the shift from the outdated and singular
focus of profit-driven business models that dominated the 20th
century to a more holistic, authentic model that embraces considerations for people, planet and profit now and into the future. 
Our services focus first on
customized sustainability assessments and reporting using the Global Reporting Initiative’s framework. These assessments provide a baseline for understanding what a business is already doing well and where it can improve. IdealEthos can then guide a business through the creation
of programs and initiatives while connecting them more meaningfully
with their communities. IdealEthos is a consulting firm committed to assisting
in the transformation of businesses to sustainable and socially responsible
organizations that thrive on making a profit while working with people in their communities
and reducing impact on the planet.
About the Founder:
Christina Ceballos has 18 years of
experience working in business, communities and on environmental issues in a variety of fields. She has worked in education, human rights and international
development in the non-profit and government sectors. After finishing two years of service in Peace
Corps in Mali, West Africa in 2007, she moved to Austin. 
Since, she has co-founded an
environmental education nonprofit and worked for an international environmental
advocacy organization. While working toward her master’s degree in Organizational
Leadership and Ethics in the school of business at St. Edward’s University, she
saw enormous untapped potential for businesses in the realm of corporate social
responsibility. The key to unlocking this potential and shifting it from a
purely public relations and marketing perspective to being an effective vehicle for
transforming business is organizational learning and authentic, deliberate
action.
About this Campaign:
The goal of this campaign is to raise funds to attend the 5th Bi-Annual Global Reporting Initiative conference in May 2016. This campaign could not have
happened without the support and guidance of the Austin+SocialGood team and for that we are immensely grateful.
What We Need & What You Get

We are seeking funding to help offset the costs attending the 5th Bi-Annual Global Reporting Initiative Conference. This conference is held once every other year and is a tremendous opportunity for IdealEthos to raise it's profile globally.
Cost of Attendance: 
The conference runs from May 18-20, 2016. In order to overcome the effects of jet-lag and to provide enough time to network and follow-up with contacts after the conference, the aim is to arrive May 16th and depart May 23rd for a total of 7 days/nights.



850 Euros or $965 US Dollars for conference registration for a non-member organization from an OECD country


250 Euros or $285 US Dollars for attending Master Classes in the morning on 5/18/16 and in the afternoon on 5/20/16.

7 days for meals, $700 US Dollars


$200 for transit and other incidentals while there


TOTAL: $5,050 US DOLLARS

We wanted to build an active community of people who enjoyed coming together for a great workout, and to create lasting, accountable relationships that centered about fitness.Using every inch of the Eastside community of Strathcona in Vancouver—our home hood—we made movement and ‘working out’ accessible to people who wanted to sweat, but hated the traditional gym setting. ​We've done pretty much every non-workout-workout that's ever been conceived. From escaping a zombie apocalypse to hurdling the living dead. ​Our current home at The Coach House has been the hub for all things Tight Club since 2013. This is where Keighty works with her personal training clients, where the run club meets up, and where loud music pushes Tight Clubbers through their hour-long HIIT workouts at all hours of the day.The need to find a permanent home dedicated to all our Tight Club antics is becoming more and more apparent. Our classes are starting to spill out into the alleyway and we're only able to apologize to the neighbours so many times for cranking ‘Bubble Butt’ at 6:30 am.When we found a space that would allow us to keep Tight Club in its original hood, we knew it was time to take the leap and give ourselves a more permanent home. Now all we need are some funds to help build out the new space.With the $30,000 we’re aiming to raise, we’re doing a ground up build: stripping everything down and building it back up to provide all the amenities you need to get from your sweat life to your work life in a snap.   
  We jam out hard; so we’ll be needing some sound proofing to keep our bass at bay. We'll need showers to clean up our sweaty bodies before we head to work and we'll need some pretty decent floors to keep our bodies (and joints) happy. We'll also need a welcoming community space so you can drink your juice and catch up with your crew before and after you get TIGHT.

Ciljamo prikupiti dodatnih 2000$, kako bismo i najmlađima pokazali da su Križevci mali grad velikih mogućnosti i jednakih prilika za sve.Svi prvašići grada Križevaca (razred po razred) će dobit besplatan izlet u Choco Bar gdje će imati priliku kušati Hedonine proizvode i upoznati se s Hedonom i njenim zaposlenicima, a za uspomenu će dobiti čokoladno srce napravljeno posebno za njih. Mali grad velikih mogućnostiDok mnogi u potrazi za poslom bježe u velike gradove, jedan gradić u blizini Zagreba dokaz je da mali grad ne mora značiti i malo mogućnosti.Jeste li ikada posjetili Križevce? Taj je grad po mnogočemu poseban, no jedna priča u sebi krije dodatnu čaroliju. U srcu Križevaca nalazi se čokolaterija Hedona - društveno poduzeće koje je osnovala ''Udruga invalida Križevci'' s ciljem da otvori radna mjesta i ubrza integraciju u društvo upravo za osobe s invaliditetom.Hedona trenutno broji 9 zaposlenih, od kojih su 6 osobe s invaliditetom.Josip, jedan od prvih zaposlenika HedoneU današnje vrijeme posao je teško pronaći, a još je teže naći onaj koji će za nas značiti više od samog radnog mjesta. Iako svatko od nas mora pronaći način kako će zaraditi za život, za neke je to poseban izazov. Najmanje privilegirana skupina u ovom smislu su osobe s invaliditetom. Gotovo polovica njih koji žive u Hrvatskoj su u radno aktivnoj dobi, no bez posla i prilike za dostojanstven život. Choco Bar - Hedonin najnoviji projektOtvaranje Choco Bara planirano je do kraja 2017. godine, a omogućit će zapošljavanje još 5 osoba, od kojih su 2 osobe s invaliditetom.Choco Bar biti će mjesto za okupljanje i uživanje u raznovrsnoj ponudi vrhunskih proizvoda križevačke čokolaterije. Imat ćete priliku kušati brojne čokolade i praline, domaće kolače i najfiniju toplu čokoladu.
želimo da naš Choco Bar bude mjesto uvažavanja različitosti koje će okupljati sve ljubitelje čokolade
želimo otvoriti nova radna mjesta i biti pozitivan primjer drugima
želimo nastaviti proizvoditi čokolade i praline za još širu publiku
Grad Križevci je Choco Baru dodijelio prostor u novootvorenom Tehološkom parku, dok je uređenje prostora osigurano iz EU fondova, ali kako bi naša usluga bila savršena potrebna su nam dodatna sredstva za financiranje opreme, stoga smo odlučili pokrenuti crowdfunding kampanju.
Za vrhunske slastice potrebna je i vrhunska opremaOduvijek smo pridavali pažnju kvaliteti naših proizvoda i usluga. Za opremanje kuhinje i šanka prema našim visokim standardima potrebno nam je dodatnih 5 000$. Sredstva ćemo iskoristiti za kupnju pećnice i točionika za vruću čokoladu. ​​​​Timeline Razlog, dva za podržati:
pružate podršku osobama s invaliditetom
sudjelujete u njihovom uključivanju u širu zajednicu i društvo
omogućujete ostvarenje njihovog prava na rad, koje je bitan uvjet ravnopravnosti
pomažete mijenjati sliku o osobama s invaliditetom, razbijati predrasude o njihovim mogućnostima
Podržite nas donacijom, a zauzvrat Vam nudimo širok spektar Hedoninih čokoladnih čarolija!
50 gramske   - mliječna/tamna/ bijela čokolada
100 gramske - mliječna čokolada s brusnicama i lješnjacima / tamna čokolada s 71% kakaa s brusnicama i lješnjacima/ bijela čokolada s brusnicama i lješnjacima
Zajedno s Križevačkom udrugom Pivara osmislili smo posebno “čokoladno” pivo, a s Križevačkim čipkaricama čipkano srce  samo za naše podržavatelje.​Osim donacijom možete nam pomoći tako da:

<p>With over 11 million workers, the restaurant industry is one of the fastest growing sectors of the US economy. Unfortunately, the backbone of this industry - the food workers themselves - have been left out of the economic boom, unable to see the fruits of their labor in an industry that could be pushing them toward a brighter future. Instead, many employees face dismal working conditions, such as low or unpaid work, lack of internal promotion, non-exist benefits and sexual harassment. The federal minimum wage has been locked at $2.13 hour for tipped workers for the past twenty-three years, dating back to 1991, and this forces tipped employees to rely solely on gratuities to make ends meet, an antiquate form of economy that in post-Civil War America was called, ""a cancer in the breast of democracy,” and in contemporary America has been proven to fuel sexual harassment and racial
discrimination.</p>
<p>Many organizations are currently fighting for restaurant
workers' rights, including ROC United, Fight for 15, Food Chain Workers Alliance, UNITED HERE - Food Service Division, and Brandworkers International.

We need your support to make the next year better than ever!</i></p><h3>Let’s Go Farther!</h3><p>2014 was a stressful year for us. We persevered and overcame -- thanks in great part to your generous donations for last year’s campaign -- and we turned it around, made things better than ever.</p><p>This year, we’d like to ask for your help again. We have more modest funding goal, but no less modest an ambition!</p><h3>What This Campaign For?</h3><p>Last year, we had a serious problem: water damage forced us to gut and rebuild three of four studios. It took a year to recover (and there are still a few things to install), but we decided to cash in some long-term project money and top-up what was spent to do more.</p><p>This year, the studios are entering full operation, and we are surging forward, but...</p><p>Our major source of funding is from the universities, and enrollment is declining. So, just as we are on the rise and doing more, we have less money to work with. We stretch and we save, and we put up with equipment that was outdated 5 years ago. We invested in people, and we’re dedicated to that.</p><p>But things are getting to be a bit more difficult: headphones are wearing out, more microphones are needed, our computers are starting to fail. We can’t afford to replace that stuff, but we need to.</p><p>That’s where you help!</p><p></p><h3>What's the Money For?</h3><p>Money raised in this campaign will allow us to do the necessary upkeep and let us reach farther. It will allow us to keep our staff and improve our quality. It allows us to expand things like Sessions, remote event coverage and audio editing. It will help us reach out further into the community and on campus, and help build our other means of fundraising.</p><p>Your money will mean we can get needed microphones, headphones, computers and other vital equipment. It means we sound better, our volunteers can host better shows, and we can breathe a bit of space into our budget.</p><h3>What If You Don’t Get It?</h3><p>Then, we manage, as best we can. We don’t buy the necessary equipment. We limit the things we do, drop some of our plans, and really worry about the bottom line. (The budget really is that tight!) We don’t want to have to choose between doing things with people and  the proper equipment to do them with, but if we have to, we will.</p><h3>Sessions? What are Sessions?</h3><p>Yes! Prior to our problems in 2014, we were in full swing producing a series called Sessions @ CHSR. Bands from all over -- touring bands and local bands -- joined a host in Studio D for a combination of interview and performance. We’ve gotten some spectacular recordings from that series -- original songs before release, alternative takes, stripped-down and acoustic versions. It’s been great fun getting to know the bands and finding out what their creative inspiration comes from, and what life in a band is like.</p><p>But when we gutted Studio D as a result of the water damage, those stopped. We recorded  71 sessions in just over 3  years, and we were looking forward to continuing the weekly schedule.</p><p>And now: we’re back!</p><h3>The Sessions EP Series</h3><p>In fact, we’re so dedicated to Sessions -- and they produce such great tracks! -- that we want to create a “best of” compilation for next year.</p><p>That compilation will be one of the rewards for helping us.</p><p>… and the more help you give, the better we can make the compilation!</p><p>Here’s how it works: you buy in on the base level of the EP -- either from the pledge level or by adding on to your pledge.</p><p>That EP will be compiled one year from now, and contain 4 of the best tracks from our Sessions over the last year.</p><p><b>BUT:</b></p><p>The better we do, the more effort we can put toward Sessions, and the more tracks we want to include!</p><p>So, as we do better, more tracks get added, until we fill out an EP with 9 tracks.</p><p>Then, we add a second EP. See where we’re going? The more people donate, the better it gets!</p><p>We’ll also start pulling tracks from the 71 sessions we’ve already done.</p><p>These albums will all be strictly digital, but if we get enough support, we’ll add an add-on option to buy a physical CD.</p><h2>CD Update!<br/>
</h2><p>We're up to 5 tracks on the EP -- and almost the 6th!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1334326/files/20150328150013-FD_2015_EP_Meter.png?1427580013"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>How Does The Sessions@CHSR EP Grow?</h3><h4>The basic EP starts at 4 tracks. Another track will be added to the
 EP at $500 earned on the campaign, and at every $500 after that.</h4><h3></h3><p>So:</p><p>$0 - 4-track EP -- DONE!<br/></p><p>$500 - 5-track EP -- DONE!<br/></p><p>$1000 - 6-track EP -- ALMOST THERE!<br/></p><p>$1500 - 7-track EP -- WE CAN DO IT!<br/></p><p>$2000 - 8-track EP -- I KNOW YOU WANT IT..<br/></p><p>$2500 - 9-track EP -- THIS WOULD BE AWESOME!<br/></p><p>Note that this will continue to climb <i>regardless</i>
 of how many people actually select the EP perk. So, even if you know 
people who aren't interested in it, encourage them to donate, both for 
our benefit <i>and</i> yours!</p><p>At $2500, we've made our goal. BUT if we get there, we'll announce plans for stretch goals to get <i>another</i> EP, and then <i>another</i> one after that, and.. Well, we'll see, after that!</p><br/><h3>How Can I Help? I don’t have much money…</h3><p>It doesn’t take a lot of money to help out -- every dollar really counts! -- but what we really need is to amplify our voice.</p><p>Let your friends know about the station. They might not be aware, but they’ll appreciate that you told them.</p><p>Tell us that you love the station. Positive feedback is encouraging, and we’ll highlight your feedback to show others how much awesome we do.</p><p>Share it on Social Media. You’ve got a phone and a finger. You can share our needs with everyone you know -- even if they don’t live here, because we broadcast online and podcast.</p><h3>What if you get all your money? Are you done?</h3><p>Heck no! We’ve got lots of projects we’d like to fund, beyond just the equipment we desperately need.</p><p>Some examples:</p><ul>
<li><p><b>An improved streamer!</b> We need to change to a better system, an MP3 streamer that plays on more devices, but we’ll need to pay a monthly service fee for that, and get a new computer.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Music Database enhancements!</b> We track every album that comes into the station, but the system needs big updates. We’d also like to take digital submissions, but we can’t afford a system to manage those yet.</p></li>
<li><p><b>The Sleeving Project!</b> Speaking of music, we have over 10,000 albums and over 60,000 CDs! But: we’re running out of space! To bridge the gap to the purely digital future, we’re transferring large jewel cases into sleeves which take up ⅓ the space. But that’s a lot of sleeves..</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sessions @ CHSR video stream!</b> We’d like to invite you to our live audience for Sessions, by letting you watch online!</p></li>
<li><p><b>Workshops! </b>We’d like to offer workshops for members and the general public, but we can’t afford the money or time to host them. From advice on writing for radio to audio editing to producing radio dramas, we'd love to talk about it all!<br/></p></li>
<li><p><b>Shake ‘n’ Bake! </b>We put on several great concerts over the years, but as money becomes tight we have to focus on other things to make things work. If we had more donations, we could give ourselves a break and put on a wicked-sized concert!</p></li>
<li><p><b>Raises for Staff!</b> The staff work for a very minimal salary, and we haven’t been able to give a real raise for years -- barely even cost of living, when at all.</p></li>
</ul><h3>So, what is CHSR? CHSR is Radio...</h3><p>For 54 years, we’ve been bringing radio -- in many forms -- to the Fredericton area. It started with very local, wired broadcasts to our current transmitter reaching the Capital region and the world through our live Internet stream and podcasting.</p><p>We are a voice for the alternative. We provide exposure for under-appreciated and under-represented music -- both from around the world and very importantly from right here in the city. We invite hosts to produce works based on issues and entertainment that matters to them, things often overlooked in the mainstream.</p><h3>CHSR is also Campus</h3><p>We’re located in the Student Union Building at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton. We started as a student club of UNB, and have expanded to embrace St Thomas University as part of our study base as well.</p><p>But our campus connections run even deeper: students from every school in the city are welcome to join us, and a great part of our audience is made up of eager students looking for something beyond the mainstream -- or looking to have a voice in their community.</p><h3>CHSR is definitely Community, too</h3><p>We grew beyond just a student club quite a while ago, and we are committed to providing the whole community of Fredericton with a reflection of the great things this city has to offer -- and the areas where we can collectively change for the better. </p><p>Through regular programs like The Lunchbox (a daily community events and interview show) and Fredericton This Week (a weekly half-hour calendar of events), we celebrate the goings-on in our community. Through great locally-focused music shows like Instant Breakfast and Homemade Jams, we give bands a chance to get great exposure, and music fans the great music they crave.</p><p>We give a strong counter-argument to the uninformed opinion that there’s “nothing going on in this city”. </p><p>We give non-profit organizations, up-and-coming musicians, emerging artists and interesting people a chance to talk about their passions, and for everyone to create compelling programming.</p><h3>Contribute to Your Community.</h3><h3>Contribute to Your Community Radio!</h3><p>Thanks!</p><p></p><h3>Add-Ons</h3>You want to challenge a show, but you want the shirt or the EP?

 EP at $500 earned on the campaign, and at every $500 after that.So:$0 - 4-track EP -- DONE!$500 - 5-track EP -- DONE!$1000 - 6-track EP -- ALMOST THERE!$1500 - 7-track EP -- WE CAN DO IT!$2000 - 8-track EP -- I KNOW YOU WANT IT..$2500 - 9-track EP -- THIS WOULD BE AWESOME!Note that this will continue to climb regardless
 of how many people actually select the EP perk. So, even if you know 
people who aren't interested in it, encourage them to donate, both for 
our benefit and yours!At $2500, we've made our goal. BUT if we get there, we'll announce plans for stretch goals to get another EP, and then another one after that, and.. Well, we'll see, after that!How Can I Help? I don’t have much money…It doesn’t take a lot of money to help out -- every dollar really counts! -- but what we really need is to amplify our voice.Let your friends know about the station. They might not be aware, but they’ll appreciate that you told them.Tell us that you love the station. Positive feedback is encouraging, and we’ll highlight your feedback to show others how much awesome we do.Share it on Social Media. You’ve got a phone and a finger. You can share our needs with everyone you know -- even if they don’t live here, because we broadcast online and podcast.What if you get all your money? Are you done?Heck no! We’ve got lots of projects we’d like to fund, beyond just the equipment we desperately need.Some examples:
An improved streamer! We need to change to a better system, an MP3 streamer that plays on more devices, but we’ll need to pay a monthly service fee for that, and get a new computer.
Music Database enhancements! We track every album that comes into the station, but the system needs big updates. We’d also like to take digital submissions, but we can’t afford a system to manage those yet.
The Sleeving Project! Speaking of music, we have over 10,000 albums and over 60,000 CDs! But: we’re running out of space! To bridge the gap to the purely digital future, we’re transferring large jewel cases into sleeves which take up ⅓ the space. But that’s a lot of sleeves..
Sessions @ CHSR video stream! We’d like to invite you to our live audience for Sessions, by letting you watch online!
Workshops! We’d like to offer workshops for members and the general public, but we can’t afford the money or time to host them. From advice on writing for radio to audio editing to producing radio dramas, we'd love to talk about it all!
Shake ‘n’ Bake! We put on several great concerts over the years, but as money becomes tight we have to focus on other things to make things work. If we had more donations, we could give ourselves a break and put on a wicked-sized concert!
Raises for Staff! The staff work for a very minimal salary, and we haven’t been able to give a real raise for years -- barely even cost of living, when at all.
So, what is CHSR? CHSR is Radio...For 54 years, we’ve been bringing radio -- in many forms -- to the Fredericton area. It started with very local, wired broadcasts to our current transmitter reaching the Capital region and the world through our live Internet stream and podcasting.We are a voice for the alternative. We provide exposure for under-appreciated and under-represented music -- both from around the world and very importantly from right here in the city. We invite hosts to produce works based on issues and entertainment that matters to them, things often overlooked in the mainstream.CHSR is also CampusWe’re located in the Student Union Building at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton. We started as a student club of UNB, and have expanded to embrace St Thomas University as part of our study base as well.But our campus connections run even deeper: students from every school in the city are welcome to join us, and a great part of our audience is made up of eager students looking for something beyond the mainstream -- or looking to have a voice in their community.CHSR is definitely Community, tooWe grew beyond just a student club quite a while ago, and we are committed to providing the whole community of Fredericton with a reflection of the great things this city has to offer -- and the areas where we can collectively change for the better. Through regular programs like The Lunchbox (a daily community events and interview show) and Fredericton This Week (a weekly half-hour calendar of events), we celebrate the goings-on in our community. Through great locally-focused music shows like Instant Breakfast and Homemade Jams, we give bands a chance to get great exposure, and music fans the great music they crave.We give a strong counter-argument to the uninformed opinion that there’s “nothing going on in this city”. We give non-profit organizations, up-and-coming musicians, emerging artists and interesting people a chance to talk about their passions, and for everyone to create compelling programming.Contribute to Your Community.Contribute to Your Community Radio!Thanks!Add-OnsYou want to challenge a show, but you want the shirt or the EP?

<p>My name is Amanda Abraham. I have come here to this site to attempt to raise urgently needed funds.

If you wan't to know how real, you can <a href=""http://wakeandbakecookbook.com/cannabis-oil/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">read this blog post</a>.

<h2><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Why?</span></h2>
<div>Your support does more than just help create a cannabis cookbook. It helps sustain an independent alternative publishing project carving out a niche in a new industry, covering a somewhat touchy subject. When I looked into publishing the first Wake &amp; Bake, the national prohibition of cannabis made it untouchable by legitimate publishers, so the book was funded by people like you. I'd like to find a way to continue creating educational, entertaining and engaging books that fill the void in this growing market.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p>I truly feel that it's my calling to bring this information to a general audience. I've been surprised to hear that many many of my readers are baby boomers who have never tried marijuana before, but have recently become canna-curious. These cookbooks, however silly they may be, seem to break the stigma surrounding cannabis use and provide an approachable way to open up discussion about safe and responsible use and ending cannabis prohibition. </p>
<p>If we can raise enough to go on a national book tour, I'll be able to talk about the things I'm really passionate about in prohibition states (i.e. healing with cannabis, legalization, and crafting legislation that truly benefits the local economy and organic growers). Help me spread the word!</p>

</div><div> <p>As a brand new start up, we never had the funding to take the first book on tour. </p>
<p>If we can reach the extended $8000 goal, we can take both books on a national tour! This means that we can get out of our bubble and I'll have the opportunity to talk about legal cannabis and making weed food across the nation. Yay! </p>
<p>Here's the funding breakdown:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>$1000- Releases Wake &amp; Bake: a second edition</p>
<p>$2500- Creates Wake &amp; Bake II</p>
<p>$3000- Makes Wake &amp; Bake II available in
Hardcover</p>
<p>$3500- Launches Regional Book Tour (Colorado) 2015</p>

to request a stop at your dispensary, in your town, or at your favorite
festival on the book tour)</p>
<h2>And for you?</h2>
<p>Check out them Perks! You can choose from digital downloads, advance copies of the book, cannabis cooking classes (via skype or in your Colorado/WA home), Wake &amp; Bake apparel and more! </p>
<p>If you have a dispensary, head shop, or indie bookstore, claim a stop on the book tour and a bunch of books at a wholesale rate. I'll promote the event at your store, answer questions and sign things! </p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Cannabis is still illegal in 48 states, and this whole thing can be a bit risky. But attitudes are becoming more relaxed surrounding weed, and I do everything I can to comply with state and local laws. While publishing can be a challenge, I've been through all of the indie publishing hoops and know what to expect this time around, so I expect the process to go a lot more smoothly and quickly. </p>

</div></div>","What's Happening? My name is Corinne Tobias, author of Wake & Bake: a cookbook. I'm a farmer, writer, photographer, designer and cannabis cook working on an independent publishing project in Colorado. 
This year, after publishing the first Wake & Bake, things got real. If you wan't to know how real, you can read this blog post. But all you really need to know is that I woke up one morning with half of a new cannabis cookbook, without a big fancy celebrity's face to put on it. 
So. Here we are. Let's make Wake & Bake II together. For starters... I need a subtitle. Since you guys are smarter, more clever, and better looking than me, I'll leave that to you. 
Wake & Bake II: Barely Legal?
Wake & Bake II: Still Baked?
Wake & Bake II: Into Dankness? 
Post your suggestions at www.facebook.com/wakeandbakecookbook
or email me at corinne@wakeandbakecookbook.com 
Next, help fund the project. It's what a smart, clever, good looking person would do. In return, I'll mail you some delightful stuff when it's done.




Why?
Your support does more than just help create a cannabis cookbook. It helps sustain an independent alternative publishing project carving out a niche in a new industry, covering a somewhat touchy subject. When I looked into publishing the first Wake & Bake, the national prohibition of cannabis made it untouchable by legitimate publishers, so the book was funded by people like you. I'd like to find a way to continue creating educational, entertaining and engaging books that fill the void in this growing market.

I truly feel that it's my calling to bring this information to a general audience. I've been surprised to hear that many many of my readers are baby boomers who have never tried marijuana before, but have recently become canna-curious. These cookbooks, however silly they may be, seem to break the stigma surrounding cannabis use and provide an approachable way to open up discussion about safe and responsible use and ending cannabis prohibition. 
If we can raise enough to go on a national book tour, I'll be able to talk about the things I'm really passionate about in prohibition states (i.e. healing with cannabis, legalization, and crafting legislation that truly benefits the local economy and organic growers). Help me spread the word!

The Goal
 As a brand new start up, we never had the funding to take the first book on tour. 
If we can reach the extended $8000 goal, we can take both books on a national tour! This means that we can get out of our bubble and I'll have the opportunity to talk about legal cannabis and making weed food across the nation. Yay! 
Here's the funding breakdown:


$1000- Releases Wake & Bake: a second edition
$2500- Creates Wake & Bake II
$3000- Makes Wake & Bake II available in
Hardcover
$3500- Launches Regional Book Tour (Colorado) 2015
$5500- Launches West Coast Book Tour 2015
$8000- Launches National Book Tour 2015 (email corinne@wakeandbakecookbook.com
to request a stop at your dispensary, in your town, or at your favorite
festival on the book tour)
And for you?
Check out them Perks! You can choose from digital downloads, advance copies of the book, cannabis cooking classes (via skype or in your Colorado/WA home), Wake & Bake apparel and more! 
If you have a dispensary, head shop, or indie bookstore, claim a stop on the book tour and a bunch of books at a wholesale rate. I'll promote the event at your store, answer questions and sign things! 
  Risks & Challenges Cannabis is still illegal in 48 states, and this whole thing can be a bit risky. But attitudes are becoming more relaxed surrounding weed, and I do everything I can to comply with state and local laws. While publishing can be a challenge, I've been through all of the indie publishing hoops and know what to expect this time around, so I expect the process to go a lot more smoothly and quickly. 
  Other Ways You Can Help Can't contribute, but you've read all of these words? You can help by helping get the word out.

Israel is currently fighting for her right to exist in the Middle East. She is defending herself from hundreds of daily missiles launched into highly populated areas by Hamas, purposefully targeting civilians. The radical Islamic terrorist group Hamas, based out of Gaza, is on a mission to eradicate Israel and anything representative of a Democracy. We are asking people who believe in the state of Israel, the only true democracy in that region, to purchase our shirts as we plan to give 100% of the proceeds to families living in Sderot, infamously referred to as ""The Bomb Shelter Capital of the World."" Whilst Gaza is always in the news, the hardship of those who live in Sderot - 3 km from the Gaza Strip - is wantonly ignored.<br/>The people of Sderot must run to bomb shelters on average 21 times a day.  Imagine doing this with children and the elderly.

She is defending herself from hundreds of daily missiles launched into highly populated areas by Hamas, purposefully targeting civilians. The radical Islamic terrorist group Hamas, based out of Gaza, is on a mission to eradicate Israel and anything representative of a Democracy. We are asking people who believe in the state of Israel, the only true democracy in that region, to purchase our shirts as we plan to give 100% of the proceeds to families living in Sderot, infamously referred to as ""The Bomb Shelter Capital of the World."" Whilst Gaza is always in the news, the hardship of those who live in Sderot - 3 km from the Gaza Strip - is wantonly ignored.The people of Sderot must run to bomb shelters on average 21 times a day.  Imagine doing this with children and the elderly. Schools have closed down, businesses empty, dozens killed and even more injured, and children have had their childhood taken away. Whilst we in the West can take our children outside to the playgrounds, take them to school and let them play football, the children of Sderot can only dream of this. The people of Sderot do not deserve this. Please help US support THEIR community.

<p>(From Phil Wheeler)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Debbie and I have known each other all our lives.  We grew up in the same church in Euclid, Ohio and attended the same youth groups.  Debbie attended Euclid HS, I did not, but we still saw each other just about every Sunday.  I joined the Navy out of High School, and Debbie went to work.  We never dated, we were just two kids who knew each other.  I would come home on leave, and I might see her, but we didn't communicate during my stint in the military.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I got out in 1973, and returned home for a couple of months before leaving to attend college at Miami University of Ohio.  I happen to be walking through the basement of our church, and I saw Debbie standing and teaching some young children.  She was wearing a black velvet skirt, a blouse with old fashioned ruffles down the front, and a ruffled collar with a black ribbon.  A broach was pinned to that ribbon.  I looked at her and said to myself <em>That is the girl I am going to marry! </em> We were married a little over 9 months later. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We moved into an apartment, then a house, and then another house, while I went to school to learn how to fix computers.  I was hired by Memorex, and we moved to Akron, Ohio.  We bought our dream house (we still live there), and planned to start a family.  Unfortunately, our 5-year plan became a 7-year plan.  Once we figured out how to do it, though, we started having babies.  First, 3 daughters, and finally 2 sons – Rachel, Abigail, Hannah, Joshua, and Joseph.  They are all grown now, and two are married.  We have 3 grandchildren – 2 girls, and a boy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It all sounds pretty idyllic, but in 1993 Debbie was first diagnosed with breast cancer and our lives changed forever.  She had a modified radical mastectomy, chemotherapy,  and later had reconstruction.    We continued on, trying to put it behind us, but nothing is ever the same after cancer strikes.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 1999 the cancer came back.  Chemotherapy, again, and a decision about a possible bone marrow transplant followed.     She was given a less than 40% chance of survival, but God performed a miracle.  The tests came back clear, and she was in remission.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2008 she again was stricken.  Chemotherapy and radiation followed, but the doctor said that it was only a matter of time, and she was given 3-4 years to live.  From that point in time to the present there has been a consent repeated pattern of treatment and cessation, treatment and cessation as the  cancer had metastasized, spreading to her liver and bones.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The chemotherapy has taken her hair (twice), made her feet and hands raw, red and painful, and robbed her of her energy.  Through if all she has continued to work as a teachers aid for the High School, and endured. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This past week, however, the tests came back and for the first time the doctor told Debbie that she has maybe 6 months to live.  She did not hold out any hope as she has in the past, she said <em>Worst case scenario is 6 months</em>, but didn't feel like it would be much more, regardless.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through this, my wife has been a source of amazement and encouragement to others in our church and the school system where she works.  I see both sides.  The one that is smiling and never letting on how tired she is or how sore her hands and feet are, and the side where she is falling asleep on the sofa right after dinner or picking off the dead skin on her hands and feet.  Each day she is a little more run down, a little weaker and less able to recover from the constant attack on her system by the cancer and by the chemotherapy. I have been watching her die slowly.  I must admit that I haven't always been the best care giver, sometimes she can be down right cranky, but I am still here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have been married for 38 years, 39 years September 7<sup>th</sup>, and for all of those 38 years she has always talked about going on a cruise.  I joke that I was on a couple in the Navy, and they weren't that big a deal.  Unfortunately, something has always stood in the way.  Kids need clothing, and cars break, the house needs fixing, or we just didn't have the time.  Now, I don't have the money to make it happen.  I lost my job, and we had to file for bankruptcy.  I never thought that I would be saying any of this at 61 years of age, but that's the way it is.  The good news is that I have just been hired as a custodian at a local church, and start Monday.  It's part-time, and I will continue to look for full-time employment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have contacted various organizations about Debbie's desire.  The <em>make a wish foundation</em> doesn't provide cruises, nor does the <em>Angel foundation</em>.  I attend a small church and have talked with my pastor, and he is talking to certain members.  I don't know what to expect, but I believe that they will help as much as they can; The economy in Ohio isn’t the best.  <em>  </em></p>

I have been watching her die slowly.  I must admit that I haven't always been the best care giver, sometimes she can be down right cranky, but I am still here.
 
We have been married for 38 years, 39 years September 7th, and for all of those 38 years she has always talked about going on a cruise.  I joke that I was on a couple in the Navy, and they weren't that big a deal.  Unfortunately, something has always stood in the way.  Kids need clothing, and cars break, the house needs fixing, or we just didn't have the time.  Now, I don't have the money to make it happen.  I lost my job, and we had to file for bankruptcy.  I never thought that I would be saying any of this at 61 years of age, but that's the way it is.  The good news is that I have just been hired as a custodian at a local church, and start Monday.  It's part-time, and I will continue to look for full-time employment. 
 
I have contacted various organizations about Debbie's desire.  The make a wish foundation doesn't provide cruises, nor does the Angel foundation.  I attend a small church and have talked with my pastor, and he is talking to certain members.  I don't know what to expect, but I believe that they will help as much as they can; The economy in Ohio isn’t the best.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>The Details</h2>
<p>I'm turning 30 this year! To celebrate, I'm hosting the biggest, best Halloween party that Seattle has ever seen - and you and your friends are invited! This is going down on the evening of Saturday, October 27th.<br/><br/>Come help me celebrate and be there for a night that won't be forgotten. And like any good Birthday Halloween party, costumes are welcome! </p>
<p>If you can't make it, at least help me put the party on by gifting $10 or by buying one of the perks and be forever recognized on the Offical Party Poster! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>For only $20 you'll get entry into the party + unlimited alcohol. Let me say that again, O-P-E-N bar. Many bars and clubs charge upwards of $30 just for cover during Halloween weekend and they won't include drinks. You'll also get a sweet HD wallpaper from the party and props for helping to make this a reality.</p>
<p>Additional dontions will earn you awesome swag, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Official Party Poster</li>
<li>A sweet light-up cup for the party (really, really awesome)</li>
<li>T-shirts! [including sizes for girls!]</li>
<li>Warm and cozy hoodies</li>
<li>A limo ride and party package for you and 7 friends!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What The Money Will Buy</h2>
<p>I'm really going all out, and <em>every cent</em> will go toward the party. You've never been to a party like this. Here's what I'm spending the money on:</p>
<h3>With $4000:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Venue - At a beautiful brick building built nearly 100 years ago</li>
<li>Alcohol - Including beer, red and white wine, and hard alcohol</li>
<li>Mixers, water, ice, cups, napkins, and other miscellaneous party supplies</li>
<li>Security - People don't mess with off-duty police officers</li>
<li>Bartenders - Professionals make better drinks</li>
<li>Projector - Showing Saturday morning cartoons, PBS, TGIF, and other classics</li>
<li>Sound Equipment - A party isn't a party without good dance music</li>
<li>Insurance - Required for a party of this size</li>
<li>Licenses - Again, required for a party of this size</li>
<li>Fees - To cover IndieGoGo and my ticketing vendor</li>
</ul>
<p>That's the minimum I need to put the party on. BUT! With a few hundred bucks extra I can do even more! Here's my ideal scenario:</p>
<h3>With $5600:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Laser Beams - One needs a license from the FDA to operate a Class 3b/4 laser system. Guess who applied for a license months ago? Now I just need money to buy the equipment and software.</li>
<li>Fog Machines - A laser is only as good as the fog in the air</li>
<li>Bubble Fogger - Imagine a bubble machine that fills the bubbles with fog instead of air. More fun to pop!</li>
<li>Johann Sebastian Joust - Super fun game that uses the Playstation Move controllers and music - no PS3 needed. Requires 7 PS Move Controllers (anyone have some I can borrow??)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2>How Else Can I Help?</h2>
<p>Tell your friends! Did I mention that they're invited, too? <br/><br/>Note: You must be 21 and older with a valid ID to enter the party.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a 39 year old mother of two starting a new career. Most of my career has been as a print advertising Account Executive, but changing times, family dynamics, and the economy have aligned in such a way that I can redefine myself and follow my passion - therapeutic massage. I am in the final 3 weeks of massage school, I have already passed my state exam, and I just need a bit of funding to open my own office. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have been fortunate enough to find a great office location right in the center of Fort Myers for only $100 per month. To secure this location and be ready for business, I am facing the following costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business license $100</li>
<li>Rent $110</li>
<li>Establishment license $300</li>
<li>Malpractice Insurance $100</li>
<li>New Massage Table $280</li>
<li>Misc (lotion, office supplies, etc) </li>
</ul>
<p>Much of the legwork has been done. I have been building my business since October by offering in home massages, and I have a base of about 60 active clients. I have an existing business page on Facebook from which I have been promoting my business (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/KandaceBlevinMassageTherapy?ref=hl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/KandaceBlevinMassageTherapy</a>), and I have a marketing plan in place. I just need the remaining funding to open my doors and establish my business.</p>
<p>For those that ae willing and able to contribute, I will offer massage sessions up to 1.5 times your contribution (massage costs $70, you contribute $140, I give you 3 one hour massages). I will also list your name and business on my web page as a founding sponsor for my business.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many people hurt every day and suffer with back pain, neck pain, stress, fibromyalgia, and insomnia to name a few. Massage Therapy is an excellent way to treat these conditions and contribute to the general wellness and well being. I have been told that I am a very talented massage therapist, and it is my goal and desire to be in this business for the rest of my life.</p>

<p class=""""><strong>The Journey Inward</strong> will provide support and inspiration for people who are looking for more meaning and connection in their lives. We will create and support a community of people that are interested in going within. This will be a place where people can contribute and benefit from the lessons of their peers; where introspective people can feel like they belong; where people can find other like-minded individuals to connect with, and get support on whatever they’re working on. Have philosophical discussions; join a group around health, or facing your fears, or relationships; find a friend who will hold them accountable to their commitments to themselves…<em> in short, a place where we can journey inward, together.</em></p>

How it works

People visit the site looking for support and inspiration. They read the quotes and personal stories others post and are inspired and moved by them. 
They can then add their own favorite meaningful quotes (brainyquotes.com) and share personal stories (chickensoup.com), or add comments to other quotes and stories. 

These quotes and stories act as a gateway into the support system: They can see how many contributors are available for groups or accountability partnerships, then send an invite to all the people attached to a particular topic or category to be in a related group. 
The groups are organized systems that allow individuals to create and manage groups & relationships (like meetup.com or supportgroup.com), receive notifications, set goals & events, have conference calls or chat room meetings and discussion groups on an ongoing basis.

“Helping someone else is often the fastest way to help ourselves.”

Wouldn’t it be great if you could connect with others who have run into the same obstacles that you have?


Or find people who are willing to keep you accountable to yourself?


Or just meet someone else who is also interested in self-discovery?

If are interested in or inspired by this project, please support us and help us build a place that will support and inspire all of us.

<p>In May 2013 I had the opportunity to travel to Kenya to visit my sister in Busia, Kenya. However, I also got the chance to meet up with my friend, Collins Ambuchi, who was my crew leader when I served in the Cleaning and Maintenance Department of the Bahá'i World Centre in Haifa, Israel from July 2009-2010 during my year of serivce after high school.</p>
<p>Since Collins had returned to Kenya he had started a small cleaning business called Star Clean Ltd. He has a very clear vision for his business: He wants to deliver excellent service and provide fair wages for his employees. </p>
<p>In May, when I visited, his business had a few employees and a couple contracts but it needed (and still needs to) to expand. Unfortunately, Collins isn't able to access a loan for this purpose without putting up some type of asset as collateral.</p>
<p>I've worked with Collins and I know his work ethic and I that's why I promised him that when I returned to the United States I would try to help raise him the funds he needed to expand. He insisted that he would repay any money loaned to him (as you see he expresses in the video) but I assured him that it would be easier to raise the money for him on a crowd funding platform and that by doing so he would be free to use the funds we rasied in whatever way he saw fit to expand his business. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p>
<p>Our funding goal: $2,800 USD</p>
<p>If we reach our goal the funds will be used to run an advertising campaign in order to secure more contracts. If we exceed our funding goal the additional funds will be used towards the purchase of an office computer, an additional floor buffer, and/or rug doctor. </p>
<p><strong>Why Star Clean Ltd. Is Different:</strong></p>
<p>The cleaning business in Kenya is rife with managers or owners taking advantage of laborers due to the fact that the jobless rate is high. Star Clean Ltd. has been founded in Kenya with the following vision:</p>
<ul>
<li>to create employment opportunities for young people</li>
<li>offer these youth training in professional cleaning</li>
<li>improve the lives of workers by offering fair wages</li>
</ul><p> </p>

Why do you care? 
You care because this is our only Earth. And these are our only animals. We are supposed to take care of them as they take care of us. We aren't supposed to murder them. They give us so much beauty and wonder. They give us a look at the areas we aren't meant to go into naturally-our oceans. Dolphins and whales are like us in so many ways.

<p>Everyone loves the cute kittens and fluffy adults, but what about the ones that have been abandoned on the streets and are starving, injured or born with a deformity that adds to their constant struggle to stay alive. </p>
<p>These are the cats that are usually overlooked for adoption after being dumped in the shelter.  The frightened souls that are euthanized because they are different or need a little extra care. </p>
<p><u><strong>THESE ARE OUR </strong></u><strong><u>MYSTICATS</u></strong><u><strong>!</strong></u><strong>  </strong><br/><br/>At our unique Cat Cafe, we will cater to the tri-pawds - the kitties that had their front or back leg amputated.

<p>Born and raised in Anchorage, Alaska, Michele was always around animals and nature. Dreaming of being a veterinarian since a young age, her connection with animals and her passion to work with them never left. Arriving in Los Angeles at the age of 19, Michele was in shock at the outrageous amount of homeless cats living on the streets.</p>
<p>Though she chose a different career path in behavioral counseling, she never strayed away from her love of working with animals. Volunteering her time in Africa, Michele has worked with lions and cheetahs in rehabilitating centers so they can continue living a life out in the wild. </p>
<p>Michele lives her life dedicated to the welfare of the animals and started a 501 C3 Non-Profit called <strong><a href=""http://krazyforkats.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Krazy for Kats, Inc.</a></strong>  For the past 13 years, she has been rescuing cats off the streets of L.A and providing them a safe place in her house to live before adopting them out to their fur-ever homes. </p>
<p>Looking for a better solution than to hold adoption events with cats in cages, Michele has formed MystiCat Cafe - a<strong> </strong>free-roaming adoption center for cats and kittens.  This is the best way for people to come in and actually hang out with all of the cats and be able to pet them.  This is the best way to get to know their personality and how they interact with others, especially before adoption.</p>

<p>My Name is John Jensen.  Many people call me the rev, it's a ironic nick name as I am a pastor, but... I am not very reverendy.  I have a wonderful wife of almost 25 years, who has put up with my crap and loved me in spite of it, and two talented daughters who are finding their own way to follow their passions and creative spirit.  I am the oldest son of five boys, and that is where my normal life ends. </p>
<p>When I was a very young toddler my mother got tired of me running out of the door.  She got a stern tone and said, ""don't you dare put one foot out of that door.  I didn't hesitate and jumped right out of the door.  She yelled, ""what did I tell you?"" and I pointed at my feet and said, ""two feet"" I have been jumping in with both feet, and looking for ways around the rules ever since.</p>
<p>In my life I have been a portugese bullfighter, a construction worker, a repo man, a bouncer, a professional cage fighter, a msssionary, I owned my own martial arts school, was a partner in a mural painting company, and my own paintings are hanging in collections internationally. One of my greatest honors was to have my paintings on display next to those of Carlos Estrada-Vega, Thomas Pathe and Fr. Bill Moore.</p>
<p>I see pipe making as the continuation of my creative impulse.  To be able to make what I see, and then share that with others, to take the incredible natural beauty of wood and make it not only a sculpture, but a sculpture that can be a part of peoples relaxation and personal expression. This just seems like good work to me. </p>
<p>Basically without your help, I am trying to learn in the dark.  Your help can literallyd determine if I can make this business work, or not!  If you want to see small, sustainable businesses started, please consider helping me.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><br/>Well, I need $2,500.00 to pay for plane fare, hotel fees, food and the course with its materials.  Any amount over the goal will be put right into the business, buying tools and materials, and if we fail to reach the goal I will place the money in a special fund hoping to add to it to go at a later date.</p>
<p>I will be offering wood sculptures, pipe accesories, discounts on pipes and pipes themselves for those of you who can give towards reaching my goal.</p>
</div>
<div>I have been starting small businesses, small churches or various projects for years.  I know your money is hard earned, but if you support me in this I promise it will be going to a good cause.  I will work hard, creatively and passionately at this business.  I will be in my community more, and this will allow me to spend more time with people that need help, or just a friend.  Trying to juggle work, a side business, our ministry and social work, and still be a good husband and father is a bit difficult as you may imagine. You can help me consolidate these endeavours.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
So you can't give?  I get that, if I had extra money I wouldn't need to do this campaign.  But if you could share this with your facebook friends, your twitter followers, your google+, any of your social networking or even emailing it to friends that might be interested.  The more people that see this, the more likely we will meet or exceed our goal.</div>

<p> </p>
<h2>I need your help.</h2>
<p>In sept of 2012 my house was sold, being that I have no family in the area and nowhere else to go a friend of mine allowed me to move in with him. What he neglected to tell me was that his house was infested with roaches and fleas. I had terminex out, and it did nothing. If you look at some of the pictures you'll see what I mean.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The roach traps get changed daily.</h2>
<p>The problem was that I could only afford one payment to the exterminator and that's not the end of the problem. I wake up daily to dead roaches lay all around me. I'm eating food out of a can for my own safety, my friend has no desire to fix the situation at all, and honestly he really doesn't care. Like I've mentioned I don't know anyone in the area so I've no place else to go.</p>
<p>I work, but the job pays little and the hours are crap. I'm only doing this because I need to move desperately. My on family won't take me in because they can't afford me and don't have the room.</p>
<h3>Moving to Arkansas</h3>
<p>This is the only option I have at this point, as you can see this was funded but the money immediately went to a tragic circumstance. I had to fix the car that was supposed to take me down there. The total sum of the repairs chewed up the donations and more.</p>
<p>My friend is becoming more and more increasingly abusive to me in nature, and is beginning to steal from me. Charging my cards (not my paypal but the card I use for direct deposit to my bank) for things. Thinking I don't notice it, he's nearly gotten into it with me physically, the situation is just getting worse and I have nowhere else to go.</p>
<h2>Please help me.</h2>
<p>I'm not asking for a whole lot, I'm just asking for enough gas to get to Arkansas, because that's the only option I have. I have a safe place there to stay.</p>
<p>My health is daily compromised, I can't use the bathroom and I can't take a shower, I've resorted to going to local YMCA's and using my friends gram's shower but she doesn't appreciate it happening all the time.</p>
<p>I'm essentially homeless, living in a condemned building. If you could take the time to read, or donate or signal boost this please do. I am very desperate. Each day I have no idea what's going to happen next, every day I could be on the street because of my friend.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>HI! I'm Adrian Paul.  You might remember me from Highlander?  As soon as Highlander finished I started a charity called 'The PEACE Fund' - PEACE stands for Protect Educate and Aid Children Everywhere. I'm passionate about kids and doing what I can to help them.</p>
<p>This campaign is a celebrity soccer match being held on Sunday May 5th.  <span>Join some of Combat Radio's best veteran/celebrity guests, (from Highlander, Spartacus, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, True Blood, Weeds etc...) members of the women's Pro-Am team 'BLUE HEAT' and the Combat Radio sponsored 'Deportivo Colima' for a LEGENDARY Cinco De Mayo soccer event....ENTERTAINMENT/HILARITY GUARANTEED!</span></p>
<p>How can you be a part of this great event and also know that your contribution is going to children in need?  I intend to win this match - (yep - Duncan MacLeod's determination and passion for winning wan't all his idea! LOL...)  That means that my team is going to score more goals than our opponents.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU:</strong></p>
<p>Your part in this?  Sponsor me for taking part in this great event.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your sponsorship is going to make a real difference.  We are going to use the money to buy an Infant Respirator for a hospital in Hungary.  Sure - $5 on its own won't do that much but when joined with all the other $$ amounts, the difference is that a baby in distress is going to live and laugh and hopefully make a positive difference in the world - all because you reached out and supported me.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help by sponsoring our goals, maybe you can help by spreading the word and sharing this URL on other lists, Boards and on other social media sites?  Let your family and friends know.  Maybe it could be your birthday gift instead of another toaster (LOL!)...</p>
<p>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
</div>
<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p>
<p>There can be only one....soccer match.  One winner....children in need.</p>
<p>Peace</p>

This campaign is a celebrity soccer match being held on Sunday May 5th.  Join some of Combat Radio's best veteran/celebrity guests, (from Highlander, Spartacus, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, True Blood, Weeds etc...) members of the women's Pro-Am team 'BLUE HEAT' and the Combat Radio sponsored 'Deportivo Colima' for a LEGENDARY Cinco De Mayo soccer event....ENTERTAINMENT/HILARITY GUARANTEED!
How can you be a part of this great event and also know that your contribution is going to children in need?  I intend to win this match - (yep - Duncan MacLeod's determination and passion for winning wan't all his idea! LOL...)  That means that my team is going to score more goals than our opponents.
WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU:
Your part in this?  Sponsor me for taking part in this great event.


The Impact
Your sponsorship is going to make a real difference.  We are going to use the money to buy an Infant Respirator for a hospital in Hungary.  Sure - $5 on its own won't do that much but when joined with all the other $$ amounts, the difference is that a baby in distress is going to live and laugh and hopefully make a positive difference in the world - all because you reached out and supported me.  


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't help by sponsoring our goals, maybe you can help by spreading the word and sharing this URL on other lists, Boards and on other social media sites?  Let your family and friends know.  Maybe it could be your birthday gift instead of another toaster (LOL!)...
Use the Indiegogo share tools!

And that’s all there is to it.
There can be only one....soccer match.  One winner....children in need.
Peace

<h1>What is
SharePointalooza?</h1>
<p>SharePointalooza is
going to be an awesome 2 day technology conference in Branson, MO on Sept 12th
and 13th. This conference is bringing together some of the best SharePoint and
Office 365  minds in the world to a part of the country that rarely gets
to experience these types of events.</p>
<p>We need your support to help close out funding for our event which is just weeks away! With your
support we can continue to bring events like these to areas that previously do
not get the chance to experience a premium technology conference at extremely
affordable costs for the attendees. </p>
<p>SharePointalooza is a
not-for-profit event. Every little bit counts, and any extra money received
will be used to make the conference even better. </p>
<p>It's going to be a

<p>Bringing a technology
conference to a smaller city is always a difficult chore. Sponsors are less
likely to support these events because they typically do not have local offices
in the area or they feel the attendance might not be large enough to justify
the expense.</p>
<p>This is the fourth
conference we've put together and by far the largest. We have a loyal group of
attendees that appreciate this area of the country being served and with the
help of this IndieGoGo project we can ensure that all are expenses are paid
and it will make future events possible.</p>
<p>We actually need more than the stated goal, but the $1,500 will ensure some of the final necessities are covered. </p>

<h3>What We Need </h3> We need <strong>YOU</strong> to get the word out!

<h3>The Impact</h3> Project Uplift wants survivors to see that individuals just like them have gone through the same thing as they have and <strong>SURVIVED</strong>. You are <strong>NOT </strong>alone, and your sexual assault does not have to define you. We as a society need to realize what an impact being sexually assaulted has on the individuals that have to go through these tragedies. Survivors need resources to help them cope with and overcome the abuse they have faced in their life. The Blue Bench offers therapy and resources for survivors, and only takes donations!<p></p>

<h3>How Can You Help?</h3> <p>Please help Diana and Colby cover the cost of travel and fees for a 12-day sailing voyage on
the tall ship Tenacious from Seville to Valencia, Spain March 5-16, 2015.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>How Does This Help?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Tenacious, along with her sister ship Lord Nelson, were designed and built by the Jubilee Sailing Trust (JST) to accommodate sailors with a broad range of disabilities, including those in wheelchairs.  Both ships use a buddy system to pair up able-bodied sailors and those with physical disabilities so they can work together to sail the vessels.  They’re the only ships in the world that do this.</p>
<p>Through their many years in operation, JST has learned that sailing facilitates rehabilitation and promotes education and a broader understanding of people with disabilities.  The program has changed lives and attitudes across the water and around the world.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This is not a luxury cruise.  It's a sailing voyage.  Sailing is hard work and there are real dangers involved on the ocean, as well as on the ship.  Colby and Diana are trained and experienced in ship safety procedures and practices and can help to guide crew to safety should an emergency situation arise.</p>
<p>As voyage crew, we'll be paired up with disabled sailors to work side by side throughout the voyage dealing with all aspects of running the ship, including helping to prepare and serve meals, washing dishes and cleaning the ship.  We will be assigned to watch groups and will be on a watch schedule while we're under sail. The watch group is responsible for monitoring ship and environmental conditions. And of course, we will set and strike sails and manage dock lines.  W<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">e will also assist disabled sailors who want to climb the rigging.</span></p>

Tenacious, along with her sister ship Lord Nelson, were designed and built by the Jubilee Sailing Trust (JST) to accommodate sailors with a broad range of disabilities, including those in wheelchairs.  Both ships use a buddy system to pair up able-bodied sailors and those with physical disabilities so they can work together to sail the vessels.  They’re the only ships in the world that do this.
Through their many years in operation, JST has learned that sailing facilitates rehabilitation and promotes education and a broader understanding of people with disabilities.  The program has changed lives and attitudes across the water and around the world.




  Risks & Challenges This is not a luxury cruise.  It's a sailing voyage.  Sailing is hard work and there are real dangers involved on the ocean, as well as on the ship.  Colby and Diana are trained and experienced in ship safety procedures and practices and can help to guide crew to safety should an emergency situation arise.
As voyage crew, we'll be paired up with disabled sailors to work side by side throughout the voyage dealing with all aspects of running the ship, including helping to prepare and serve meals, washing dishes and cleaning the ship.  We will be assigned to watch groups and will be on a watch schedule while we're under sail. The watch group is responsible for monitoring ship and environmental conditions. And of course, we will set and strike sails and manage dock lines.  We will also assist disabled sailors who want to climb the rigging.




  Other Ways You Can Help We are truly grateful for your assistance and thank you for anything you can do to help us achieve our goal.  Please spread the word to your family, friends and colleagues.
By the way, you don't have to be an experienced sailor to join one of these voyages. For more information on the program and how you can get involved, please visit the JST website.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who, What &amp; Why</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hi! I'm
Tyce Light, and welcome to <b>Bongo &amp; Blanket's Bakehouse</b>. We are a dog ""barkery"" based in Montpelier Vermont dedicated to producing <i>wheat-,
corn-, and soy-free dog biscuits</i>. (Well, when I say ""we"" I really mean
just me along with the generous help of a friend or two when needed. Did I
mention I'm really grateful for their help?) <b>Bongo &amp; Blanket's Bakehouse
</b>biscuits are <b>made with love</b>, really <b>good stuff</b>, no bad stuff, and <b>even more
love</b>. They help build the bond between dogs and their humans, one tail wag at a
time. Our next project is getting these tasty biscuits into more stores for
Christmas, and for that, we could really use a cookie dough depositor; it would
allow moving production out of the home kitchen and into a dedicated commercial
kitchen space. This is where <i><b>YOU can help</b></i>.</p>
<p>I need to
raise $2500 to cover the cost of a <i>Rhodes Kook-E-King Manual Counter Top Cookie
Dough Depositor</i>, plus shipping and insurance, or I will not be able to keep up
with production as currently each biscuit is cut by hand with a cookie cutter.
So I'm turning to <b><i>my strongest supporters, YOU</i></b>, to ask for contributions. In
exchange, I'm offering <b>really great perks</b>, like fridge magnets (everyone loves
a fridge magnet), T-shirts, and of course, dog biscuits. Your contribution will
help us ramp up production with the Kook-E-King cookie dough depositor, and
further, it will help spread the love that comes in each <b>Bongo &amp; Blanket's
Bakehouse</b> biscuit. <b><i>Thank YOU!</i></b></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;"">Currently, production is out of my home kitchen; however, this is not sustainable if the business is to grow. I have the opportunity to move production to the Vermont Food Venture Center but cannot continue there with cutting each biscuit individually with a cookie cutter. Production costs would skyrocket despite the excellent set-up they have.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;"">A cookie dough depositor would reduce what currently takes up to an hour or more of production time to just a few minutes.</span></p>

<li>The additional $300 in the request will go toward shipping and insurance to deliver the unit to Vermont.</li>

kitchen space. This is where YOU can help.
I need to
raise $2500 to cover the cost of a Rhodes Kook-E-King Manual Counter Top Cookie
Dough Depositor, plus shipping and insurance, or I will not be able to keep up
with production as currently each biscuit is cut by hand with a cookie cutter.
So I'm turning to my strongest supporters, YOU, to ask for contributions. In
exchange, I'm offering really great perks, like fridge magnets (everyone loves
a fridge magnet), T-shirts, and of course, dog biscuits. Your contribution will
help us ramp up production with the Kook-E-King cookie dough depositor, and
further, it will help spread the love that comes in each Bongo & Blanket's
Bakehouse biscuit. Thank YOU!



Where Do You Come In?
In a nutshell, we're asking you to believe in what we do, and to show that by contributing to the expansion of the business. Can it be more basic than that?
Since launching to the public in March 2013, the response to Bongo & Blanket's Bakehouse has been stupendous, enormous, fantastic...in a word, superlative. Six months down the track, we've reached the point where we need money to make money.
Currently, production is out of my home kitchen; however, this is not sustainable if the business is to grow. I have the opportunity to move production to the Vermont Food Venture Center but cannot continue there with cutting each biscuit individually with a cookie cutter. Production costs would skyrocket despite the excellent set-up they have.
A cookie dough depositor would reduce what currently takes up to an hour or more of production time to just a few minutes.
What Do We Need?


Approximately $1400 for the purchase of a Rhodes Kook-E-King Manual Counter Top Cookie Dough Extractor.

Approximately $300 for additional dies. We're looking at a unit for $1700 including bone-shaped dies.
The additional $300 in the request will go toward shipping and insurance to deliver the unit to Vermont.
The additional funds in the $2500 amount sought will go a small way to covering the cost of the perks and the fees to Indiegogo and PayPal.


What's In It For You?
Apart from the great feeling you will have contributing to the success of a small business in Central Vermont, there are a number of perks outlined to the right. These include public acknowledgement of your contribution, refrigerator magnets, T-shirts (see an image in the Gallery section) and, it goes without saying, Bongo & Blanket's Bakehouse biscuits.
What If We Don't Reach Our Goal?
We'd really rather not think of that! To respect the transparency of our relationship, we will use monies raised to purchase ingredients, additional labels and product bags, corrugated cardboard case boxes, and other production-related items.

<p><b>Who?</b></p>
<p>My
name is André Leonardo and I am a 24 year old entrepreneur from Portugal.</p>
<p>I
have been developing social projects over the years. Among others, I have
organized and promoted two non-profit international
entrepreneurship events in Azores for 600 people each (both sold out for the
first - and second - time in Azores), brought together 24 recognized speakers
including Luis Filipe Vieira (S.L.Benfica president), Garrett Mcnamarra (World
Class Surfer), Michael Grove (CEO Collabworks), Luis Marques (CEO SIC) or Mário
Ferreira (CEO Douro Azul), manage more than 30 people and generate thousands of
Euros for social purposes. It was awesome!</p>
<h5><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Last year I have done a small
entrepreneurship tour. I have done more than 30.000km, went to 12 cities in two
continents and interviewed more than 70 top CEO´s, entrepreneurs and
politicians. My goal was to find out how, when and why can an entrepreneur be
successful in Azores and after a much extended research I went to best regions
in the world in the categories that Azores were good to learn and bring some of
that knowledge to Azores – I visited Silicon Valley (technology), Vaxjo
(greenest city in Europe), Asturias (one of the most advanced regions in rural
tourism), among others. It just went great!</span></h5>

<p>“PAWIS” translates to “sweat” and symbolizes the struggles, 
hardships, and sacrifices of the members to provide for the needs of our
 loved ones with dignity.

</p>
<p>*In 2002, PAWIS was formed to fight against social and economic 
injustice faced by Filipino workers and im/migrants in Santa Clara 
County. Initial PAWIS members were former airport screeners, resulting 
from the U.S. Aviation and Transportation Security Act after 9-11-2001.</p>
<p>*This Act is discriminatory against Filipino workers and im/migrants.
 It requires airport screeners to be US citizens and that they pass a 
new employment and language test, which had nothing to do with the job 
of airport screeners.</p>
<p>*Today PAWIS continues to support Filipinos in Santa Clara County, 
the bay area, in the U.S and around the world. Many are working in 
industries such as health care, retail/sales, and electronic 
manufacturing.</p>
<h4>NAFCON - National Alliance for Filipino Concerns</h4>
<p>NAFCON is a national multi-issue alliance of Filipino organizations and 
individuals in the United States serving to protect the rights and 
welfare of Filipinos by fighting for social, economic, and racial 
justice and equality. At present, NAFCON members encompass over 23 
cities in the United States.<br/></p>

So we wanted to create a space where we can execute our mission statement.
This space will be used to run workshops such as:
History

Learning about Philippine History
Filipino American History and our Contribution to America


Culture

Baybayin Workshops
Learning Tagalog
Hiphop Workshops
Cultural Dance 

Filipino Martial Art
Safe space for the youth


Struggle
Youth and Students Issues
Human Trafficking
Workers Rights
Know Your Rights Training


Workshops will be run by me, community members and community organizations.Organizations:

Anakbayan Silicon Valley

Anakbayan Silicon Valley (ABSV) is a comprehensive youth organization  
that seeks to unite all youth in the struggle for genuine social change 
and liberation of the Philippines. By educating, organizing, and 
mobilizing the youth in Silicon Valley, ABSV fights for the rights of 
Filipinos in America and advances the Philippine struggle for national 
democracy.PAWIS - Pilipino Association of Workers and Immigrants
“PAWIS” translates to “sweat” and symbolizes the struggles, 
hardships, and sacrifices of the members to provide for the needs of our
 loved ones with dignity.


*In 2002, PAWIS was formed to fight against social and economic 
injustice faced by Filipino workers and im/migrants in Santa Clara

What we need.


We need $25,000.00 to cover the lease for a whole year.That means this will give us a whole year to raise funds for the next year of operation.Which we will be selling Know Your Roots Apparel and a screen printing services to sustain the operation of the space.Honestly, this will run as a non-profit space, but without the 501c paper work.Instead of relying on a big funding from an institution, I prefer funding from the community that i want to serve. That means, we as a business would have to answer to that community. Why we need.
With the crime rate and homicide rising around Silicon Valley, the youth needs a safe place where we can offer activities and keep them off the streets.
There's a huge Filipino population is San Jose and Silicon Valley, but not enough social services
There's a  trend in CA that the filipino community is 
starting to be recognized (AB 123 + Itliong-Vera Cruz Middle School + Filipino Mural Project), so
 it's timely that the SJ Filipino community be recognized as well with a
 comprehensive community spaceA common place where the Filipino community can gather and come together.A place to foster creativity and learning.

My name is Matt Schober, and along with my partner and longtime friend Ryan Slick, we're here to share our passion for an amazing new concept to make you smarter, stronger, more peaceful, and ultimately happier.</p>
<p>We want to see Indianapolis and surrounding communities able to reach their goals<br/>and become the vibrant, productive, and happy people that they want to be. And through our lifelong interest in nutrition, fitness, and wellness, we've put together the perfect ingredients to help our patrons reach their personal best, whether in creative, intellectual, or athletic pursuits. <br/><b></b></p>
<p><b>I'm skeptical, but intrigued. How do you plan to do that?</b></p>
<p><strong></strong>We're so glad you asked!</p>
<p><br/>We are launching a truly innovative new business in the heart of our hometown of Indianapolis, and we're truly excited! Better Being will be launching in early 2014; introducing Indiana's only Float Tanks, which provide a level of relaxation and inner exploration not seen anywhere else. In addition to these wonderful devices, we will carry a new style of supplement, blending the best in Western nutritional science with the best in Eastern herbal therapy, along with a couple new twists, culminating in an absolutely unique and incredibly effective line of products. What? You want more? Ok, fine...how about the latest and best in biofeedback technologies, superfoods and whole food extracts that make eating healthy easy and delicious, AND constant improvement as the wellness market continues to innovate?<br/><br/>Excited yet?!?!?!?<br/><br/><b>But what is a float tank?</b></p>
<p>Great question! <br/><br/>A float tank (or sensory deprivation tank) contains approximately 8-10 inches of water, with around 800 lbs of pharmaceutical grade salts dissolved in it, allowing a person to become completely buoyant. This leads to complete and total body relaxation, because of the ease of strain on your muscles and even bones, providing pain relief from a vast range of symptoms and lowering blood pressure and stress hormones. In addition, time in the tank post-workout has been proven to lower lactic acid in the blood and muscles, improving recovery and getting you back in the game faster. And it's not just physical – your brain enjoys the downtime as well, as thousands of documented and amazing personal experiences will show. It has also been shown to improve learning abilities and creativity, and enhances meditation tremendously. A well studied body of research that grows daily supports the numerous mental and physical benefits of the tank. <br/><br/><strong>Sounds cool...what's it like in there?<br/><br/></strong> Once the lid is closed the tank is light- and sound-proof, but don't worry – even claustrophobic people have used the tank and enjoyed it thoroughly once getting over an initial hesitation. In fact, the dark, quiet environment is the perfect compliment to the skin-temperature water, and the combined experience of “letting go” has compelled a wide array of people across the world into making it a part of their routine.<br/><br/><strong>So if this is such a great idea, why have I never heard of it before?</strong></p>

<p>As for biofeedback, this simply means technologies that allow us to read variables such as heart rate and realistically gauge the effects that stress, Floating, and our products can have on you.

My name is Matt Schober, and along with my partner and longtime friend Ryan Slick, we're here to share our passion for an amazing new concept to make you smarter, stronger, more peaceful, and ultimately happier.
We want to see Indianapolis and surrounding communities able to reach their goalsand become the vibrant, productive, and happy people that they want to be. And through our lifelong interest in nutrition, fitness, and wellness, we've put together the perfect ingredients to help our patrons reach their personal best, whether in creative, intellectual, or athletic pursuits. 
I'm skeptical, but intrigued. How do you plan to do that?
We're so glad you asked!
We are launching a truly innovative new business in the heart of our hometown of Indianapolis, and we're truly excited! Better Being will be launching in early 2014; introducing Indiana's only Float Tanks, which provide a level of relaxation and inner exploration not seen anywhere else. In addition to these wonderful devices, we will carry a new style of supplement, blending the best in Western nutritional science with the best in Eastern herbal therapy, along with a couple new twists, culminating in an absolutely unique and incredibly effective line of products. What? You want more? Ok, fine...how about the latest and best in biofeedback technologies, superfoods and whole food extracts that make eating healthy easy and delicious, AND constant improvement as the wellness market continues to innovate?Excited yet?!?!?!?But what is a float tank?
Great question! A float tank (or sensory deprivation tank) contains approximately 8-10 inches of water, with around 800 lbs of pharmaceutical grade salts dissolved in it, allowing a person to become completely buoyant. This leads to complete and total body relaxation, because of the ease of strain on your muscles and even bones, providing pain relief from a vast range of symptoms and lowering blood pressure and stress hormones. In addition, time in the tank post-workout has been proven to lower lactic acid in the blood and muscles, improving recovery and getting you back in the game faster. And it's not just physical – your brain enjoys the downtime as well, as thousands of documented and amazing personal experiences will show. It has also been shown to improve learning abilities and creativity, and enhances meditation tremendously. A well studied body of research that grows daily supports the numerous mental and physical benefits of the tank. Sounds cool...what's it like in there? Once the lid is closed the tank is light- and sound-proof, but don't worry – even claustrophobic people have used the tank and enjoyed it thoroughly once getting over an initial hesitation. In fact, the dark, quiet environment is the perfect compliment to the skin-temperature water, and the combined experience of “letting go” has compelled a wide array of people across the world into making it a part of their routine.So if this is such a great idea, why have I never heard of it before?
Because we're just now opening!Seriously though, floating has been around for quite some time. Initially developed by Dr John C Lily in 1954, the idea gained some steam in it's early years but was haltedin the 80's when the public began to (very mistakenly) believe that AIDS could be transmitted through water. Swimming pools took a hit and the fledgling Float industry bottomed out, despite the fact that sanitation has never been an issue due to well established cleaning procedures.
But, in the last 10 years or so, it's made quite a comeback, and around 2010 experienced the biggest boom in the industry yet. This is due in part to the Flotation Tank Association, and to celebrity floaters like Joe Rogan and Robin Williams,  but most of all to the rapidly growing and incredibly enthusiastic community of floaters!Alright, alright, you sold me on the tank.

Consumers have become increasingly interested in knowing where their food comes from, which is why the coming year will bring an added emphasis to a different kind of food celebrity — the farmer. During the last few years we saw sales flourish among grocery retailers who jumped on the movement among consumers to “buy local.” In this age of transparency, interest in the farm-to-fork journey has grown considerably, inspired in part by food safety scares and more importantly a desire to know how the food we are serving our families is being produced.


Summary
By all counts the food service industry is a difficult one. The last few years has brought higher food prices at unprecedented levels, crops and livestock destroyed by global weather catastrophes, nations at war over the lack of food supplies, and more food recalls from unique points of origin.
But just as food prices escalate and consumers are faced with fewer and fewer food choices, there is a new realization that locally produced foods provide an opportunity to better control food choices.  Simultaneously, local food producers are finding a wonderful opportunity to supply a new niche market:  the locavore – that is, a person interested in eating food that is locally produced, not moved long distances to market.  And yesterday’s gourmand has multiplied into factions of foodies – people with a passion for cooking, dining out and eating.
There is a certain sense that the “local farmer/producer” is disconnected from the community due to the strong influence of the conventional economy.  The social and cultural divide that keeps food producers and consumers at arm’s length can in some way contribute to the fact that consumers believe they lack control over their choice in product and source. “Consumers want a connection. They want to know the farmers, and they want to know the person that made their food. […] This connection is filling a void.” (Stephani-Ruff, 2005)
In another qualitative study by the Hartman Group, a regional consulting firm, the term “local” is less about closeness to home, but instead it is a “story about a farmer that brings the experience to them. There is a meaning and connection to the farmer.  Consumers know where it came from because it is authentic or straightforward.”  (Hartman Group, 2005)
Many consumer focus groups have found that farmers’ markets and locally owned restaurants are a primary source of “community-building” (Food Policy Council Brief, 2005). “[The history of local foods] connect neighbors of all ages to both the heritage of food and the future of sustainable agriculture.” (Ibid, 2005)
In fact, according to a recent market study by JWT, the environmental impact of food choices will become a more prominent concern as stakeholders – brands, governments, and activist organizations – drive awareness around the issue and rethink what kind of food is sold and how it’s made.  As more regions grapple with food shortages and/or spiking costs, smarter practices around food will join the stable of green “best practices”.  
Markets are not the only ones catering to new market demands.  Many restaurants are becoming more sustainable by revamping their practices and the types of foods they serve.  In the US, there are several restaurant associations dedicated to helping restaurants make the transition. The Magnitude of what the contributor has for this project will benefit many people.
I need 10,000 to 20,000 to begin my journey. To have great food and have friends enjoy it. If i Dont reach the entire goal It will be a blessing no matter what , and every penny will still go to the business so i can produce the best product i can.I understand everyone cant contribute but all I ask is if you can tell another person about my project or share this they might want to conspire to help me. 

What your money will go towards:

Equipment: commercial dehydrators, commercial food processors, high speed blenders, refrigeration, counter tops, sinks, immersion heaters, dishwasher, etc
Building the space: materials, plumbing, electricity, permits, getting everything to health code
Other essential stuff: tables, chairs, dishes, etc

<h3>Our Intentions</h3>
<p>The Unis'tot'en Action camp is perhaps the most important environmental direct action campaign currently in progress against the expanding fossil fuel industry in British Columbia.  Although this mass export development seems imminent in the near future, it is crucial that we take the time to focus on building responsible support networks between indiginous and settler communities.  </p>
<p>We plan to organize this Teach-In responsibly with an appropriate anti colonial mindset to enable allyship and trust with the Wet’suwet’en nation.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>The Teach-In</h3>
We will try to provide a space for the leaders of the Unis'tot'en clan to build relationships with the local first nations and grass roots settler organizers around Victoria and Vancouver.  Through our organizing processes and throughout the duration of the teach-in, we will recognize the sovereignty of the local first nations, acting respectfully with their influence in mind.  Our hope is to provide a comfortable space for organizations and nations to meet and strengthen our relationships with trust and understanding, sharing our cultures and intentions.  Ultimately we believe this is a critical strategic moment to strengthen support networks for the Wet’suwet’en nation, which undoubtably neccesitates our ability to communicate and work together effectively.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Grassroots Support</h3>
</div>
<div>We are entirely volunteer run, and  are seeking out many individuals within our community to support us in this work.  We need to cover expenses such as venue fees, food for participants, and our travel budget for First Nations leaders joining us from the front line-</div>

<div>We would greatly appreciate your support by making a donation and sharing this campagin.  We hope to use this opportunity to increase momemntum and empowerment within our own communities, as well as to stengthen relationships between indiginous, settler, and front line communities. </div>

<p><strong>Battle of the Sexes Show</strong> is a distinctive yet interactive social event for patrons to network and participate in lively discussions surrounding the topics of love, marriage, sexuality, dating, and relationships.</p>
<h2><strong>Our History</strong></h2>
<p>In 2011 after hosting several episodes of my blogtalk radio show called “Menage A Talks” I decided that “sexy and intellectual” conversion should not only be restricted to online radio. I had a strong desire to bring young urban professional men and women together to defy stereotypes and learn more about each other in a fun, non-judgmental way.</p>
<p>Our first show was in September of 2011 in New York City, I hosted and our panel consisted of Lincoln Anthony Blades, Angielala &amp; Slim Jackson. I knew very little about planning events let alone one in another city. I lost a lot of money and had some chaotic moments but it was a success based on the fact that everyone who attended had an amazing time.</p>
<p>Little did I know that this leap of faith would lead to <strong>two successful</strong> shows in my <strong>hometown of Toronto</strong> accompanied by demand from audiences internationally to bring Battle of The Sexes to their cities.</p>
<h2><strong>Our Mission</strong></h2>
<p>In 2013 we set out to bring Battle of The Sexes Show from Toronto to FIVE US cities: <strong>Oakland, Atlanta, Washington D.C, New York City and Los Angeles.</strong></p>
<p>Up until this moment I've backed this project with every penny that I've earned. I have the moral support of my panel members, vendors and loved ones however financing a 5-city tour is a task that takes more than just the contents of my flimsy wallet to accomplish.</p>
<h2>Our Purpose</h2>
<p>My dream is much bigger than me, since the show’s birth in 2011 many small businesses have had an outlet to promote their products and services. Our panelists have gone on to receive more speaking opportunities, win awards and publish their own books.</p>
<p>Most importantly our guests have raved about the quality men and women who attend the events (aka eye candy) ;)</p>
<h3><em><strong>We must be doing something right</strong></em></h3>
<p>Please help us raise $10,000 to jump start the 2013 Battle of The Sexes Tour. The more money we raise the more cities we can bring Battle of The Sexes to in 2013. An average of $2000 will go towards the budget of each city’s show.</p>
<p>Let's keep sexy &amp; intellectual conversation alive &amp; create more opportunities for folks who have wonderful businesses and talents the world has yet to see.</p>

Battle of the Sexes Show is a distinctive yet interactive social event for patrons to network and participate in lively discussions surrounding the topics of love, marriage, sexuality, dating, and relationships.
Our History
In 2011 after hosting several episodes of my blogtalk radio show called “Menage A Talks” I decided that “sexy and intellectual” conversion should not only be restricted to online radio. I had a strong desire to bring young urban professional men and women together to defy stereotypes and learn more about each other in a fun, non-judgmental way.
Our first show was in September of 2011 in New York City, I hosted and our panel consisted of Lincoln Anthony Blades, Angielala & Slim Jackson. I knew very little about planning events let alone one in another city. I lost a lot of money and had some chaotic moments but it was a success based on the fact that everyone who attended had an amazing time.
Little did I know that this leap of faith would lead to two successful shows in my hometown of Toronto accompanied by demand from audiences internationally to bring Battle of The Sexes to their cities.
Our Mission
In 2013 we set out to bring Battle of The Sexes Show from Toronto to FIVE US cities: Oakland, Atlanta, Washington D.C, New York City and Los Angeles.
Up until this moment I've backed this project with every penny that I've earned. I have the moral support of my panel members, vendors and loved ones however financing a 5-city tour is a task that takes more than just the contents of my flimsy wallet to accomplish.
Our Purpose
My dream is much bigger than me, since the show’s birth in 2011 many small businesses have had an outlet to promote their products and services. Our panelists have gone on to receive more speaking opportunities, win awards and publish their own books.
Most importantly our guests have raved about the quality men and women who attend the events (aka eye candy) ;)

<h2>Everyone Deserves a Christmas.</h2>
<h3>Why I'm doing this:</h3>
<p>As a child, one of the most magical things in life is Christmas. Many of us have fond memories of getting that special present, wrapped with ribbons as the smells of Christmas dinner tickle our senses. All our needs are met, we have clothes that fit and hot running water. Now <strong>imagine for a moment that you're a child who doesn't have all that</strong>. It's not your fault things are this way, and it seems that Santa forgot you existed. It must be your fault, you weren't good enough, right?</p>
<p>My name is Kirsten Young, I am 24 years old. I grew up in the poor part of town, in the oldest, most decaying house on the block with my mother and sister. My mother was self employed, didn't make much money, and I can remember we had a christmas tree <em>once</em>. I was well aware Santa did not exist many years before the kids in my school caught on, because if he did exist he must have lost my address!</p>
<p>I attended an expensive school on full scholarships, and watched as everyone I knew came back from the Christmas breaks with all their new clothes, talking about all their cool new toys. This was not something my mother could afford, and I was often bullied as a result.</p>
<p>***Update: I have been reminded that I was not on full scolarships at this school, my mother worked extra hard to afford me this education, paying off loans every year as the other school systems wouldn't nurture my learning capabilities in the same way.

<p>To my mother's relief, some of the local parishes in our community offered a Christmas sponsorship program that did its best to help out impoverished families during the Christmas season. As my school was connected to these parishes, they knew we were a needy family and offered us a chance to participate. Thanks to their kindness, my sister and I were able to get a few presents; things we would never have had otherwise. Nice clothes, nice books, nice toys, and a full turkey dinner!</p>
<p>As the years progressed, I had the chance to participate in the gift-giving side instead of the receiving side, as each class in our school sponsored a different family every year. We had a list of the ages and genders of the children, the age and gender of the parent(s), lists of what they needed and wanted, and so raised money to buy the gifts accordingly. I used to stay after school to finish wrapping all the rest of the gifts after we'd gone shopping for them, as it meant so much to me to be able to pay forward the kindness.</p>
<p><strong>When Christmas doesn't come to a child's house</strong>, they take it personally. Instead of a heart full of joy and excitement, these children experience depression and sadness. The parents may experience guilt, shame, and more depression.</p>
<p><strong>With your help</strong>, we can bring Christmas to at least some of those families, and make a real impact on their lives with this random act of kindness. We can meet some of their most desperate needs, and give them something to smile about. Let's spread some cheer!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm asking for as much funding as I can get. Every penny will be spent on sponsoring families for whom Christmas seems like a distant dream. The more money that is raised, the more families we can bless. If I have to start this year by only blessing one family, then that is what I will do. But I have hope that we can bless many, many more.</p>
<p>A $20 donation means skipping out on 4 lattes, or two meals at a restaurant, or one pizza. In return you can be pleased with yourself that you've helped to feed and clothe children this Christmas!</p>
<p>In my day job I am not only a housewife but also a papercrafter (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TheScrapDragon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/TheScrapDragon</a>), so <strong>I am offering packs of 4 exclusive handmade Christmas Cards for anyone who donates $20, and packs of 10 exclusive handmade Christmas Cards for anyone who donates $40. <em>For a donation of $100 or more, I will personally make for you all the cards you need for a year!</em> </strong>(When claiming these perks please use the tools to the right that say ""claim this perk"" or I won't know if you want it!)</p>
<p>If the goal of $1000 is not reached, I will use whatever has been raised for the exact same purpose, only a smaller number of children will be reached. And no matter what happens this year, I will continue this project every year that I am able.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am on a mission to recreate for other children the feelings of gratitude I had as a child for the wonderful people who helped to make my life feel normal for that one day of the year. I want my two sons to experience this kind of giving and remember this for the rest of their lives so they might pass on the tradition. <strong>Over time, we can potentially reach hundreds (if not thousands) of children and give them lasting memories of fun, joy, and peace.</strong></p>
<p>The lives of the people we can help will be affected in a very positive way. This may renew their faith in humanity, or at least take some pressure off what is supposed to be a joyful occasion.</p>
<p>I have been involved in every step of this kind of program over the years, all the way from the application forms, organisation and distribution, to the receiving end. I am in touch with family support workers who know which families could use the most help, which will help me put this money where it can be most useful. I'm not here to help myself or my friends, but to help people (mainly children) understand what joy feels like in hopes it will bring more joy into their lives as a result.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Monetary donations are very graciously accepted, but if you can't make a donation, why not take a second and share this campaign with your friends via whatever form of social media you're into? Someone might see and be more than willing to donate.</p>
<p>Indiegogo has provided some tools here that make sharing easy!</p>
<p>If you're a journalist, feel free to write an article about my cause! I can be contacted on the facebook page address listed above.</p>
<p>However you choose to help (even if all you do is share this), you will be making a huge impact on people's lives! Even a small amount of money can buy socks, a shirt, or pair of jeans. To a needy child, that's a big deal. To a struggling parent, <em>that means the world.</em></p>

</div></div>","Everyone Deserves a Christmas.
Why I'm doing this:
As a child, one of the most magical things in life is Christmas. Many of us have fond memories of getting that special present, wrapped with ribbons as the smells of Christmas dinner tickle our senses. All our needs are met, we have clothes that fit and hot running water. Now imagine for a moment that you're a child who doesn't have all that. It's not your fault things are this way, and it seems that Santa forgot you existed. It must be your fault, you weren't good enough, right?
My name is Kirsten Young, I am 24 years old. I grew up in the poor part of town, in the oldest, most decaying house on the block with my mother and sister. My mother was self employed, didn't make much money, and I can remember we had a christmas tree once. I was well aware Santa did not exist many years before the kids in my school caught on, because if he did exist he must have lost my address!
I attended an expensive school on full scholarships, and watched as everyone I knew came back from the Christmas breaks with all their new clothes, talking about all their cool new toys. This was not something my mother could afford, and I was often bullied as a result.
***Update: I have been reminded that I was not on full scolarships at this school, my mother worked extra hard to afford me this education, paying off loans every year as the other school systems wouldn't nurture my learning capabilities in the same way. Later in my life I earned enough scholarships to cover the cost of college, which is where I got mixed up. Sorry! My mother deserves credit here as it was very expensive for her.***

<h3>About Nathan P. Murphy's and The Blues Clinic<br/>
</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nathan P. Murphy's </span><br/></p>
<p>When Nathan P. Murphy's first opened its door 30 years ago, owner and founder Bob Martin defied the odds and chose downtown Springfield, MO to be the home to best in jazz and blues. The club's first national touring act was none other than Buddy Rich.  He has since showcased the likes of the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, Count Basie's Orchestra, the late Maynard Ferguson, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, John Mayall, Tommy Castro and Joe Bonamassa...just to mention a few. <br/></p>
<p>Nathan P. Murphy's has remained the anchor for downtown Springfield as the town continues to grow and  continue to sprout up in the area. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Blues Clinic</span><br/></p>
<p>Seventeen years ago Bob Martin was invited as a guest to share his expertise of artists and musicians with radio listeners.. and has been on air ever since. Springfield was quick to recognize Bob's knowledge and love of music in combination with his genuine love of his town and its residents. Bob, better known as Dr. Bob, has answered to record breaking ratings year after year.<br/></p>
<h3>Our Story-What Happened<br/>
</h3>
<p>Nearly five years ago Dr. Bob was diagnosed with <b>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</b> C.O.P.D. Dr. Bob is a non smoker. The cause was exposure to second hand smoke.  The national acts the club was once famous for came to a halt as Dr. Bob privately focused on his health. He nearly lost his life. Dr. Bob now only has 53% of his lung capacity. Consequently, Murphy's became the first smoke free venue in downtown Springfield and as he healed, Dr. Bob resumed booking talented artists and musicians.  As Dr. Bob and his club were making a comeback, the economy fell to despair. As a result, the club was hit with another devastating blow. As most of America struggled to recover from this recession, very few indulged arts and entertainment.  </p>
<p>As the club continued to suffer, Dr. Bob's radio program continued to grow in the ratings. It was obvious that Springfield, MO had the Blues. What most of Dr. Bob's listeners don't realize is that Dr. Bob's position at the Blues Clinic is a labor of love...in other words...an unpaid position. For 17 years on air Dr. Bob has dedicated his shows to his love of music and his fans. <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What all of this means to Dr. Bob, Nathan P. Murphy's and You</h3>
<p>With nothing coming in from his time on air and the staggering decline in patrons to the club, Dr. Bob and his Blues Clinic aka Nathan P. Murphy's have become the latest victims in this perilous economy and are now facing foreclosure.</p>
<p>If foreclosed upon Bob Martin will lose his home, Dr. Bob will lose his Blue Clinic, his fans will lose their Sunday morning shot of the Blues, and Springfield will lose 30 years of history.<br/></p>

<p>Samuel Jillali, world traveler and third-culture kid, settles in Kenya to build a new entrepreneurial life based on the principles of returning to the soil and how to get closer to the elusive concept of 100% sustainability.</p>
<p>His goal is not just to expand Footprints Farm from fresh vegetables to dairy and honey production, but to create a ""get away from it all"" lodge and volunteer center for foreigners and residents of the Ugenya community. </p>
<p>Hear it from the man, himself.... </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Hi everyone,</h2>
<p>Quick introduction here! My name is Sam and I’m originally from France, although I grew up in many different countries, including India and Kenya, thanks to my parents’ wander lusting ways. More recently, though, I have lived and worked in Europe.</p>
<p>In 2009, I had the crazy notion that leaving everything I knew and starting a farm in Africa would be a good idea. Fast forward three years later and here I am with 15 acres of land and 15 employees in Ugenya, Kenya.</p>
<p>It’s been a wild ride of ups and downs with a few successes and, unfortunately, some massive failures as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 180px;"">The Farm</h2>
<p>For the moment, we have been concentrating on horticulture; growing tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, spinach, cabbage, courgette, cauliflower and much more. All of the produce we grow is sold locally, either in restaurants and hotels or in the local market places.</p>
<p>This is an area in Kenya where agriculture has hardly been experimented with before, and most rural villages live mainly off the maize and kale that they are able to grow on their own plots of land. It has certainly been an interesting process as we slowly start introducing new types of vegetables into the market.</p>
<p>Over the past two years since we started vegetable production, we have seen a huge change in the markets. Fresh vegetables are becoming more readily available and local farmers have started experimenting with new crops as well; simply because they have seen that it can be done.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 150px;"">    The Dream</h2>
<p>Although we have had some success with vegetable production and have been able to find stable markets for most of what we grow, our ultimate dream is to have a completely sustainable farm where locals can come to receive training or just pick up some new ideas for their own farms.</p>
<p>Part of this dream is also to create a lodge near the farm where both Kenyans and foreigners can come and stay for a few days or weeks to get away from their concrete jungle, relax, enjoy nature, and maybe even try their hand at farming.</p>
<p>But big dreams start with smaller ones, so for now we want to focus on bringing Footprints Farm to the point where it is entirely self-sustainable. This will include everything from cows and chickens for milk, eggs and organic fertilizer, to bees for honey and better pollination of crops, to trees for shade and soil conservation.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 150px;"">What We Need</h2>
<p>We are already moving steadily towards our goal of becoming sustainable, with over 2,000 new trees planted, a steady crop production, a cow shed and chicken house nearly set up, and a good chunk of money set aside for purchasing the cows and chickens.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are still short of some of the money we need to get our dairy unit up and functioning properly. It’s a huge undertaking and we’ll need to plant feeds for the cows, set up a refrigeration unit at the farm and hire more staff that is competent with dairy farming.</p>
<p>Two-thousand Euros will help us to tie up all the loose ends and get things to the point where we are actually making good profit so that we can continue to expand on these ideas.</p>
<p>Anything you are able to give will go a very long way to helping us make our dream a reality. And who knows? Maybe in a few years you’ll be spending your vacation with us at the new Footprints Farm Lodge in Kenya…</p>

</div></div>","Samuel Jillali, world traveler and third-culture kid, settles in Kenya to build a new entrepreneurial life based on the principles of returning to the soil and how to get closer to the elusive concept of 100% sustainability.
His goal is not just to expand Footprints Farm from fresh vegetables to dairy and honey production, but to create a ""get away from it all"" lodge and volunteer center for foreigners and residents of the Ugenya community. 
Hear it from the man, himself.... 
 
Hi everyone,
Quick introduction here! My name is Sam and I’m originally from France, although I grew up in many different countries, including India and Kenya, thanks to my parents’ wander lusting ways. More recently, though, I have lived and worked in Europe.
In 2009, I had the crazy notion that leaving everything I knew and starting a farm in Africa would be a good idea. Fast forward three years later and here I am with 15 acres of land and 15 employees in Ugenya, Kenya.
It’s been a wild ride of ups and downs with a few successes and, unfortunately, some massive failures as well.
 
The Farm
For the moment, we have been concentrating on horticulture; growing tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, spinach, cabbage, courgette, cauliflower and much more. All of the produce we grow is sold locally, either in restaurants and hotels or in the local market places.
This is an area in Kenya where agriculture has hardly been experimented with before, and most rural villages live mainly off the maize and kale that they are able to grow on their own plots of land. It has certainly been an interesting process as we slowly start introducing new types of vegetables into the market.
Over the past two years since we started vegetable production, we have seen a huge change in the markets. Fresh vegetables are becoming more readily available and local farmers have started experimenting with new crops as well; simply because they have seen that it can be done.
 
    The Dream
Although we have had some success with vegetable production and have been able to find stable markets for most of what we grow, our ultimate dream is to have a completely sustainable farm where locals can come to receive training or just pick up some new ideas for their own farms.
Part of this dream is also to create a lodge near the farm where both Kenyans and foreigners can come and stay for a few days or weeks to get away from their concrete jungle, relax, enjoy nature, and maybe even try their hand at farming.
But big dreams start with smaller ones, so for now we want to focus on bringing Footprints Farm to the point where it is entirely self-sustainable. This will include everything from cows and chickens for milk, eggs and organic fertilizer, to bees for honey and better pollination of crops, to trees for shade and soil conservation.
 
What We Need
We are already moving steadily towards our goal of becoming sustainable, with over 2,000 new trees planted, a steady crop production, a cow shed and chicken house nearly set up, and a good chunk of money set aside for purchasing the cows and chickens.
Unfortunately, we are still short of some of the money we need to get our dairy unit up and functioning properly. It’s a huge undertaking and we’ll need to plant feeds for the cows, set up a refrigeration unit at the farm and hire more staff that is competent with dairy farming.

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Sean Kennedy spent his 20 years on earth welcoming anyone who needed help into his home. He was murdered in 2007 for being gay. (<em>His murderer, Stephen Moller, served less than a year</em>.) After his death, his mother found out that all the people he'd invited to sleep in their living room for the night were strangers. But to Sean, they were friends who needed help. No one was a stranger in Sean's eyes. <strong>Likewise, this LGBT center will be able to house a few teens for the night and provide local resources for help, in areas like suicide prevention and homelessness due to being LGBT (or for any other reason).</strong></p>
<p>Some of these resources would include suicide prevention and a place to sleep for the night. The LGBT center would also be able to house Gay-Straight Alliance meetings for students who are homeschooled or whose schools don't allow it (which here, is most of them). </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>South Carolina desperately needs a place like this. Having lived in Spartanburg all my life, I can vouch for this. We need help for our LGBT youth, who are constantly being bullied or rejected or pushed to the brink of death. As much as we wish teachers or parents would be supportive, they are most often the perpetrators, not saviors. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>OpenLayers contributors have been working tirelessly to make the most powerful, flexible web mapping client toolkit for years, and now we need your help. </p>
<p>The web has advanced, and others are showing all the amazing things possible. To properly take advantage of the next generation of web technologies we believe it is time for OpenLayers to be redone from the ground up.</p>
<p>If OpenLayers has ever helped you in a project then please consider supporting the team now with funding to create the next generation of advances, with WebGL, smaller builds, friendly APIs, and better default design.

<p>Funding will sponsor dedicated project management and developer time of the leading OpenLayers contributors to bring the API to 3.0, as well as a series of dedicated sprints to make significant progress.</p>
<p>We are giving out several 'perks' to contributors, including credits in the OpenLayers release notes, t-shirts, and invitations to the final 3.0 sprint, which will focus on user needs and documentation.</p>

<p>Yes, You know them....Two intelligent, energetic, and enthusiastic Women, and casualties of the hospitality industry downsizing, trying with all of their might to follow their passion and open a dessert cafe. For the last two years, the two have been operating under the name ""Viva Las Cupcakes "", but they realized that the name was self limiting, and now operate under the name that says it all: ""Buttercream"".</p>
<p>""Buttercream Dessert Cafe"" will feature:</p>
<p>Cup Cakes</p>
<p>Cup Pies</p>
<p>Cup Cheesecakes</p>

<p>and much more....</p>
<p>But we can't do this alone. We need YOUR help, to make this dream materialize....and are asking for your financial support to help get our dream off the ground!

</h3>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><span>Considering
a home improvement project? No matter how big or small your home
improvement project is, My DIY Budget is the place to start. Whether
you plan to hammer every nail, be your own general contractor, hire
out the entire job, or somewhere in between, </span><strong><span>My
DIY Budget is the first tool to pull out of your DIY project toolbox</span></strong><span>.
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thinking
about making some changes to your house or yard? You've already
decided to spend some money on a home improvement project, but you
want to save money too. The fastest way to save on home improvements
is to </span><strong><span>""Do
it Yourself""</span></strong><span>!!!
The more you do yourself the more money you'll save. Even if you
don't want to pick up a single tool, My DIY Budget will help you save
on your project costs. </span>
</p>
<p><span>Start
by visiting My DIY Budget for ideas from </span><b><em><span>real
people doing real DIY projects</span></em></b><span>.
The DIY industry websites, magazines and TV shows have great ideas,
but they don't tell you what the price tag is for their projects. If
you already know what you want to do, even if you're going to hire
out the whole job, you'll save time and money when you meet with your
general contractor and their designers. And, you'll already have a
good idea of where their bid should come in! </span>
</p>
<p>
Congratulations, you've dreamed up the perfect home improvement
project. You're excited because you know that you're going to love it
when it's done and you can't wait! So now what? Well, you need to
answer these 3 questions: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><b><em><span>How
	do I build my DIY project?</span></em></b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
		Internet support for ""How-to"" do a DIY project is
		excellent. 
		</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
		That wheel has already been invented and is doing fine. 
		</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><b><em><span>How
	much will my DIY project cost?</span></em></b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
		The Internet gets a poor grade here, at best maybe a D or D+. 
		</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
		Watch out for DIY Project Estimators and Calculators, these are
		tied to bids from contractors. These are useful if you're looking
		for a contractor. 
		</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If
		your dream project has been done by a My DIY Budget project owner,
		then you have your answer. </span><strong><span>Browse
		projects</span></strong><span>
		listed on My DIY Budget and compare your project to the real cost
		from a </span><b><em><span>real
		project done in your own home town</span></em></b><span>.
		</span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

Considering
a home improvement project? No matter how big or small your home
improvement project is, My DIY Budget is the place to start. Whether
you plan to hammer every nail, be your own general contractor, hire
out the entire job, or somewhere in between, My
DIY Budget is the first tool to pull out of your DIY project toolbox.



Thinking
about making some changes to your house or yard? You've already
decided to spend some money on a home improvement project, but you
want to save money too. The fastest way to save on home improvements
is to ""Do
it Yourself""!!!
The more you do yourself the more money you'll save. Even if you
don't want to pick up a single tool, My DIY Budget will help you save
on your project costs. 

Start
by visiting My DIY Budget for ideas from real
people doing real DIY projects.
The DIY industry websites, magazines and TV shows have great ideas,
but they don't tell you what the price tag is for their projects. If
you already know what you want to do, even if you're going to hire
out the whole job, you'll save time and money when you meet with your
general contractor and their designers. And, you'll already have a
good idea of where their bid should come in! 


Congratulations, you've dreamed up the perfect home improvement
project. You're excited because you know that you're going to love it
when it's done and you can't wait! So now what? Well, you need to
answer these 3 questions: 



How
	do I build my DIY project?




		Internet support for ""How-to"" do a DIY project is
		excellent. 
		



		That wheel has already been invented and is doing fine. 
		




How
	much will my DIY project cost?




		The Internet gets a poor grade here, at best maybe a D or D+. 
		



		Watch out for DIY Project Estimators and Calculators, these are
		tied to bids from contractors. These are useful if you're looking
		for a contractor. 
		


If
		your dream project has been done by a My DIY Budget project owner,
		then you have your answer. Browse
		projects
		listed on My DIY Budget and compare your project to the real cost
		from a real
		project done in your own home town.
		




		No two dream DIY projects are exactly alike, but a deck is a basic
		structure. The differences are in the personal touches that match
		your taste and personality. Find a design that is close to yours,
		make the adjustments to fit your design and you'll have a good
		estimate. 
		




How
	do I manage my DIY project budget?



If
		you love working with ""Spreadsheets"",
		Internet support gets an B+. If you want to use Software
		to manage your budget,
		the score is ZERO.
		There is nothing out there! That
		is until now!!!



With
		My DIY Budget, the
		wheel has finally been invented.
		Despite the fact that every website giving advice on doing DIY
		projects says to plan a budget and keep track of your costs, nobody
		has created a tool to do this. Making a list or spreadsheet with
		guesstimates for major expenses are fine, if you don't mind going
		over
		budget on your project.
		As they say ""the devil is in the details""! 



My
		DIY Budget is a comprehensive system for planning, estimating and
		managing the cost
		of your home improvement project. Build a complete list of
		materials, including contractors and labor hired out, with the
		costs for your estimate. Enter the expenses as you go and have a
		constant projection of the final cost of your project. Save
		money and eliminate the end of project ""Sticker Shock""
		for your DIY projects.
		



Save
		time so you have more time to do the real work. When you've found a
		project like yours on My DIY Budget, import
		the list of materials
		and adjust it to your needs. When you're ready to make your
		Saturday morning trip to the big box store, print
		out your shopping list
		and eliminate those extra trips back for the things you forgot.

A little historyThe My DIY Budget website started out as a personal use desktop program for managing my own DIY projects.

There is a technical war going on and the targets are all of us; the ordinary internet users! Hackers, data thieves, and government surveillance agencies have advanced technical skills and nearly endless financial resources to infiltrate the core basic infrastructure of what we call ""the internet"". They infiltrate services, software, websites, devices, routers and also servers to monitor everything we do online. We believe that encryption is the antidote for this kind of contamination happening in our lives.<br/><br/>To ensure seamless encryption with CyberGhost VPN, we have to be in control of the whole process: Login-system, encryption protocol, key management and finally also the server itself. We do that right now by renting or buying dedicated servers with root access that are packed with its own anti-spy tools  to make sure they are not intercepted.<br/><br/>But, frankly speaking, the only way to make sure that no NSA agent or hacker had physical access to one of our servers is to build an own data center with the designated use to be a #NoSpyProxy node.</p><div>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The CyberGhost #NoSpyProxy was setup and now is being taken care of by our Certified Security Specialists and is serving to protect people all around the world from mass surveillance, hackers,
data and identity theft.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This first #NoSpyProxy is the prototype for a new model of data center. It is ironically not a ""data"" center -  it is a ""no-data"" center, a new generation of a working technical unit that is built to protect people's privacy and security online. It is the blueprint for a bunch of small #NoSpyProxy nodes that we can roll out in the future in every country and region. It's easy to handle, and most importantly: NSA-proof!<br/><br/></p>

<div><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Primarily, the leak from Edward Snowden made us understand that a NSA-proof #NoSpyProxy data center is needed. We simply don’t want a world where everyone is monitored all the time. People have a right to be private and this is our way of ensure more privacy and security for everyone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The way of financing a ""Privacy as a Service"" company like ours is an important factor of the game. If we would raise money for equity, we would accept money ""with strings attached"". It is also the wrong way to finance the service with advertising. If you are not paying for it, you become the product. Privacy and ad-based services don't go together. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The best way for us is to ask for money directly from our users: you! As long as we work directly for you, we will do everything we can not to fail in our mission. Making a business out of security and privacy is a good way to hand over control to our most powerful controller: our customers! Or in other words: ""He who pays the piper calls the tune.""<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We
want to raise at least €50,000 from our German community (<a href=""http://igg.me/at/1nospyproxy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">click here for the German Indiegogo campaign</a>) and right here  $70,000 from our
international community. For all your contributions, we’ve prepared some
special perks. This way, you will get prior and exclusive access to this NSA-proof #NoSpyProxy data center and enjoy the advantages of being a premium subscriber.</p>

<br/><a rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: black;""><h2>What will be done with the funds?</h2></a><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We want to raise €100.000 in two different campaigns: $70,000 here and €50.000 <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/5e07ffb9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://igg.me/at/1nospyproxy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">from our German speaking community</a>. This will give us enough money to buy enough hardware to host a minimum of 48 #NoSpyProxy servers and pay for the necessary connectivity (bandwidth) for one year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The money gives us the peace to get the #NoSpyProxy servers out of beta and introduce Premium accounts or upgrades for our existing users. With some luck, we can start to build a second #NoSpyProxy data center somewhere abroad as another thorn in the side of the NSA. ;-)</p>

<div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CyberGhost VPN is right now available all over the world –just like 
Indiegogo. We have users in America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.
 Our company is founded by some Germans, but we are located in 
Bucharest, Romania. Right now, we speak eight different languages in our
 company and we are fans of that international family thing. So we 
decided for a platform that is available all over the world and supports
 PayPal and regular Credit Cards payments to make the audience for that 
campaign is as wide as possible.</p>
<strong>Aren’t you all a bit crazy with to build a ""NSA-proof"" data center? I mean, that's quite a big thing.</strong><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">There is a good argument for that.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Is your CEO Robert really wearing a St. Pauli T-Shirt every day?<br/></strong>Um, yes. Kind of.  And we are all happy that he has dozens of them, so 
he is really wearing  a new one every day.<br/></p>
<strong>Can I really get a lifetime subscription for CyberGhost? What does that mean?</strong><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We will provide you with a magic serial code. This code will run for 
99 years and will always contain the highest subscription level we 
offer. Like magic…</p>
<strong>What do I get when I claim a  business account?</strong><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">You get your very own private VPN server, together with all other 
servers in our server park. But this server is your precious; your very 
special place to be and you can share it with up to 100 employees. 
That means that you receive 100 Activation Keys from 
us.</p>
<b>Do you have a BitCoin (BTC) address I can donate to?</b><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes, you can get our

<p><b>How can I contribute?
What payment methods do you offer?</b></p>
<p>The payment methods
offered depend solely on Indiegogo. At the time it is PayPal and various credit
cards like Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. Note that the type
of credit card accepted might depend on the country you live in. Also the
payment with credit cards will be handled by PayPal, regardless if you have a
PayPal account or not.</p>

</h2>
<br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Cyberghost is a VPN
startup, with over 5 million users all around the world. We’re here to
 set people free from all internet restrictions, to help them access 
blocked content, to protect their privacy, and to be secure while doing online 
activities. We’re trying to reboot the Internet to the way it used
to be in its early days.</p>
<b>No track policy!</b><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Do we log, keep logs, protocol surfing behaviors or record content, 
visited websites or IP addresses of our users? No! Why? People in non 
democratic countries (this maybe YOU!) are in real danger, just for 
expressing their opinions. If we implemented backdoors, deep packet 
inspections or store information about our users and share those with 
authorities regardless their origins, we would risk the lives of 
people.We will not do that! Ever!</p>
<b>Easy to use, everywhere for everyone</b><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Internet
 security is no longer a privilege only available to geeks and nerds, 
the so called ""computer 
experts"". CyberGhost VPN is super simple to use and delivers security 
and privacy based on military-grade encryption; quick and easy with just 
one click! We offer easy to use free applications to <a href=""https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_us/download/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">download </a>for Windows, Mac, <a href=""http://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_us/wifi-safe-spot"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iOS</a> and Android. Our free <a href=""https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_us/proxy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">anonymous proxy</a> is an immediate solution for easy anonymous web browsing. And finally our free <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cyberghost-vpn-free-proxy/fcbnikgemihknccdjaihjnfbapinljpi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chrome add-on</a> integrates quick and easy into your browser and offers simple and easy anonymous browsing.</p>
<b>Global network<br/></b>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have 550+ VPN servers in 44 locations in 31 countries around the 
world. All servers are encrypted with AES 256-bit and offer fast connections and a wide access to blocked content 
abroad. Our users can change between them whenever they need to 
appear in another place.</p>
<b>Blazing fast connection</b><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">One
 of our dreams is to to build a security service that you don't feel 
while surfing or downloading. That's why we optimize everything on 
supreme speed AND security. We offer gigabit servers with a cutting-edge
 hard- and software configuration. Our custom built #NoSpyProxy is the 
next step to the perfect configuration.</p>
<b>Premium customer support</b><br/><p>We offer support to our users by internet and live chat from Monday to Friday, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM MET.</p>
<b>Security and Privacy made in Europe</b><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We
 are located in
Europe and operate under the Romanian Legislation, which gives us the 
right NOT to keep
logs and protect our users identities. And let’s be frank, we all know 
there
is no chance to run a privacy company on the territory of the ""Five 
Eyes"", Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and USA without 
being forced to store and track data of the users.</p>

<b>""Open Doors"" instead of ""Open Source""</b><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The
 security bug Heartbleed was open source software's biggest failure to 
date. A simple OpenSSL programming mistake opened a security hole in a 
program that affected hundreds of millions of websites. Open source is 
also not automatically a attribute for a specific level of security. We 
believe that transparency and ""best practices"" are more important. 
That's why we agree to invite civil rights and net activists or NGO 
members to our headquarters, to study our source code as well as our 
locations. Audits and best practices combined are the best way to ensure
 a good level of security. Here at CyberGhost, we
are using the industry's best practices when it comes to the quality of the 
services
offered, which is why we are as a company process certified as ISO 9001 
and ISO 27001. Our Security Engineers have individual CompTIA Security+ 
Certificate and are heading now to the next level.</p>
<b>Transparency Report</b><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">True to the company's mission to protect its users, CyberGhost VPN has decided to publish a <a href=""https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_us/transparency-report"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Transparency Report</a> detailing only the number of the requests
 to disclose individual users' personal data received since its founding
 in 2011 up to the present day. The requests have been made by 
authorities, companies and individuals in relation to suspected offenses
 carried out through CyberGhost VPN. The company has not and could not 
in any circumstance provide user data to those who request it, because 
this would be in breach of CyberGhost VPN's mission to protect its 
users, and because no user data records exist.<b><b><b><b><br/></b></b></b></b></p>
<b>Dedication for internet privacy</b><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We like to call him
the heart of CyberGhost. Robert Knapp, our CEO and co-founder, has been 
with
the company from its very early days. He has put a lot of passion and 
time into
this project, and helped guiding the team into developing one of the 
most
popular privacy and security solutions worldwide. Robert always keeps 
his office door open for
whoever has questions on privacy. He is also a public speaker, always

government surveillance are also the ones least able to pay. If you are new to CyberGhost and have no Premium account yet:The
 Priority Boarding perk is quite a good deal for you. You get a Premium 
Plus subscription (with instant access to our 550+ servers) in the 
current worth of $109.99 plus priority access to our 48 #NoSpyProxy 
servers worth  $79.99 (together $189.98) for just $97.00 (Early
 Bird).If you are an existing CyberGhost user with an active Premium account:Go for the Priority Boarding perk and upgrade your existing subscription to a 1-year Premium Plus subscription including access to the #NoSpyProxy servers (current upgrade price $29.99 Premium Plus + $79.99 #NoSpyProxy = together $109.99) for just  $57.00 (Early Bird). What do you get out of the CyberGhost #NoSpyProxy datacenter?The internet as we know is no longer a secure place. There is a technical war going on and the targets are all of us; the ordinary internet users! Hackers, data thieves, and government surveillance agencies have advanced technical skills and nearly endless financial resources to infiltrate the core basic infrastructure of what we call ""the internet"". They infiltrate services, software, websites, devices, routers and also servers to monitor everything we do online. We believe that encryption is the antidote for this kind of contamination happening in our lives.To ensure seamless encryption with CyberGhost VPN, we have to be in control of the whole process: Login-system, encryption protocol, key management and finally also the server itself. We do that right now by renting or buying dedicated servers with root access that are packed with its own anti-spy tools  to make sure they are not intercepted.But, frankly speaking, the only way to make sure that no NSA agent or hacker had physical access to one of our servers is to build an own data center with the designated use to be a #NoSpyProxy node.

The CyberGhost #NoSpyProxy was setup and now is being taken care of by our Certified Security Specialists and is serving to protect people all around the world from mass surveillance, hackers,
data and identity theft.
This first #NoSpyProxy is the prototype for a new model of data center. It is ironically not a ""data"" center -  it is a ""no-data"" center, a new generation of a working technical unit that is built to protect people's privacy and security online. It is the blueprint for a bunch of small #NoSpyProxy nodes that we can roll out in the future in every country and region. It's easy to handle, and most importantly: NSA-proof!



CyberGhost in the press



Why CyberGhost needs your help?

Primarily, the leak from Edward Snowden made us understand that a NSA-proof #NoSpyProxy data center is needed. We simply don’t want a world where everyone is monitored all the time. People have a right to be private and this is our way of ensure more privacy and security for everyone.
The way of financing a ""Privacy as a Service"" company like ours is an important factor of the game. If we would raise money for equity, we would accept money ""with strings attached"". It is also the wrong way to finance the service with advertising. If you are not paying for it, you become the product. Privacy and ad-based services don't go together. 
The best way for us is to ask for money directly from our users: you! As long as we work directly for you, we will do everything we can not to fail in our mission. Making a business out of security and privacy is a good way to hand over control to our most powerful controller: our customers! Or in other words: ""He who pays the piper calls the tune.""
We
want to raise at least €50,000 from our German community (click here for the German Indiegogo campaign) and right here  $70,000 from our
international community. For all your contributions, we’ve prepared some
special perks. This way, you will get prior and exclusive access to this NSA-proof #NoSpyProxy data center and enjoy the advantages of being a premium subscriber.


What will be done with the funds?We want to raise €100.000 in two different campaigns: $70,000 here and €50.000 from our German speaking community. This will give us enough money to buy enough hardware to host a minimum of 48 #NoSpyProxy servers and pay for the necessary connectivity (bandwidth) for one year.
The money gives us the peace to get the #NoSpyProxy servers out of beta and introduce Premium accounts or upgrades for our existing users. With some luck, we can start to build a second #NoSpyProxy data center somewhere abroad as another thorn in the side of the NSA. ;-)

Why Indiegogo? Why are you going with the Gogos?


CyberGhost VPN is right now available all over the world –just like 
Indiegogo. We have users in America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.
 Our company is founded by some Germans, but we are located in 
Bucharest, Romania. Right now, we speak eight different languages in our
 company and we are fans of that international family thing. So we 
decided for a platform that is available all over the world and supports
 PayPal and regular Credit Cards payments to make the audience for that 
campaign is as wide as possible.
Aren’t you all a bit crazy with to build a ""NSA-proof"" data center? I mean, that's quite a big thing.There is a good argument for that.
Is your CEO Robert really wearing a St. Pauli T-Shirt every day?Um, yes. Kind of.  And we are all happy that he has dozens of them, so 
he is really wearing  a new one every day.
Can I really get a lifetime subscription for CyberGhost? What does that mean?We will provide you with a magic serial code. This code will run for 
99 years and will always contain the highest subscription level we 
offer. Like magic…
What do I get when I claim a  business account?You get your very own private VPN server, together with all other 
servers in our server park. But this server is your precious; your very 
special place to be and you can share it with up to 100 employees. 
That means that you receive 100 Activation Keys from 
us.
Do you have a BitCoin (BTC) address I can donate to?Yes, you can get our
BTC details here. If you want a
perk, email us your details at indiegogo@cyberghost.ro!

How can I contribute?
What payment methods do you offer?
The payment methods
offered depend solely on Indiegogo. At the time it is PayPal and various credit
cards like Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. Note that the type
of credit card accepted might depend on the country you live in. Also the
payment with credit cards will be handled by PayPal, regardless if you have a
PayPal account or not.
For those of you who
want to pay anonymously, CyberGhost offers payment via Bitcoin. Please contact indiegogo@cyberghost.ro for details.
The regular payment
provider for CyberGhost products, Cleverbridge, is in no way part of the
Indiegogo payment.
Other than contributing, how can I help?We’d love it if you
could spread the word about this campaign and CyberGhost to your friends. The
more that people can benefit from online security and anonymity, the better!  



What makes CyberGhost different?

Cyberghost is a VPN
startup, with over 5 million users all around the world. We’re here to
 set people free from all internet restrictions, to help them access 
blocked content, to protect their privacy, and to be secure while doing online 
activities. We’re trying to reboot the Internet to the way it used
to be in its early days.
No track policy!Do we log, keep logs, protocol surfing behaviors or record content, 
visited websites or IP addresses of our users? No! Why? People in non 
democratic countries (this maybe YOU!) are in real danger, just for 
expressing their opinions. If we implemented backdoors, deep packet 
inspections or store information about our users and share those with 
authorities regardless their origins, we would risk the lives of 
people.We will not do that! Ever!
Easy to use, everywhere for everyoneInternet
 security is no longer a privilege only available to geeks and nerds, 
the so called ""computer 
experts"". CyberGhost VPN is super simple to use and delivers security 
and privacy based on military-grade encryption; quick and easy with just 
one click! We offer easy to use free applications to download for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. Our free anonymous proxy is an immediate solution for easy anonymous web browsing. And finally our free Chrome add-on integrates quick and easy into your browser and offers simple and easy anonymous browsing.
Global network
We have 550+ VPN servers in 44 locations in 31 countries around the 
world. All servers are encrypted with AES 256-bit and offer fast connections and a wide access to blocked content 
abroad. Our users can change between them whenever they need to 
appear in another place.
Blazing fast connectionOne
 of our dreams is to to build a security service that you don't feel 
while surfing or downloading. That's why we optimize everything on 
supreme speed AND security. We offer gigabit servers with a cutting-edge
 hard- and software configuration. Our custom built #NoSpyProxy is the 
next step to the perfect configuration.
Premium customer supportWe offer support to our users by internet and live chat from Monday to Friday, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM MET.
Security and Privacy made in EuropeWe
 are located in
Europe and operate under the Romanian Legislation, which gives us the 
right NOT to keep
logs and protect our users identities. And let’s be frank, we all know 
there
is no chance to run a privacy company on the territory of the ""Five 
Eyes"", Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and USA without 
being forced to store and track data of the users.

""Open Doors"" instead of ""Open Source""The
 security bug Heartbleed was open source software's biggest failure to 
date. A simple OpenSSL programming mistake opened a security hole in a 
program that affected hundreds of millions of websites. Open source is 
also not automatically a attribute for a specific level of security. We 
believe that transparency and ""best practices"" are more important. 
That's why we agree to invite civil rights and net activists or NGO 
members to our headquarters, to study our source code as well as our 
locations. Audits and best practices combined are the best way to ensure
 a good level of security. Here at CyberGhost, we
are using the industry's best practices when it comes to the quality of the 
services
offered, which is why we are as a company process certified as ISO 9001 
and ISO 27001. Our Security Engineers have individual CompTIA Security+ 
Certificate and are heading now to the next level.
Transparency ReportTrue to the company's mission to protect its users, CyberGhost VPN has decided to publish a Transparency Report detailing only the number of the requests
 to disclose individual users' personal data received since its founding
 in 2011 up to the present day. The requests have been made by 
authorities, companies and individuals in relation to suspected offenses
 carried out through CyberGhost VPN. The company has not and could not 
in any circumstance provide user data to those who request it, because 
this would be in breach of CyberGhost VPN's mission to protect its 
users, and because no user data records exist.
Dedication for internet privacyWe like to call him
the heart of CyberGhost. Robert Knapp, our CEO and co-founder, has been 
with
the company from its very early days. He has put a lot of passion and 
time into
this project, and helped guiding the team into developing one of the 
most
popular privacy and security solutions worldwide. Robert always keeps 
his office door open for
whoever has questions on privacy. He is also a public speaker, always  
excited to speak about the value of online privacy and internet 
security.


What CyberGhost stands for


The internet was first
created as an environment where everybody could express their opinion and have
unrestricted access to information while remaining anonymous. And we believe it
should stay that way!
Surf privately
CyberGhost
VPN encryptes your traffic and hides your IP and replaces it with one of
 your choice. This way, you surf online anonymously and protect your 
data from snooping by your internet service provider and visited 
websites. Moreover, we don't keep logs.
Evade hackers and data thieves
We encrypt
your connection and never keep logs, so you don’t have to worry about the
security of your personal passwords, bank account, and credit card details - even on public Wi-Fi hotspots.
Access content from any country
With
CyberGhost VPN you gain access to censored or geo-restricted content from all
around the world and bypass government or workplace censorship of sites like Facebook, Gmail and YouTube.

<p>As Emory’s only

social impact in the local Atlanta community through targeted short-term debt

<p><b>Doing Our Part to Close The Microbusiness Gap: </b></p>
<p>According to
research recently conducted by Emory University, urban low- and high-poverty
residential neighborhoods are home to a similar amount of businesses employing
5 or more people; however, there is a substantial gap in the number of
microbusinesses (with 4 or fewer employees) per capita in high-poverty
neighborhoods. EIIG believes that investing in such microbusinesses generates
income for entrepreneurs and their families while at the same time builds
neighborhood vitality.</p>

</div></div>","What
is the Emory Impact Investing Group (EIIG)? 






As Emory’s only
undergraduate impact investing group, Emory Impact Investing Group (EIIG) promotes
social impact in the local Atlanta community through targeted short-term debt
investments to micro-entrepreneurs. We provide an educational experience for
our members by engaging them in all aspects of the lending process including
fundraising, investment analysis / selection and loan monitoring. 

 
Doing Our Part to Close The Microbusiness Gap: 
According to
research recently conducted by Emory University, urban low- and high-poverty
residential neighborhoods are home to a similar amount of businesses employing
5 or more people; however, there is a substantial gap in the number of
microbusinesses (with 4 or fewer employees) per capita in high-poverty
neighborhoods. EIIG believes that investing in such microbusinesses generates
income for entrepreneurs and their families while at the same time builds
neighborhood vitality.
                  

Why Your Support Matters to EIIG: 
In conjunction with Emory University's Social Enterprise @ Goizueta and the Start:ME Accelerator program, EIIG is working to expand the amount of capital available to promising micro-entrepreneurs
starting or growing ventures in the communities of Clarkston and East Lake /
Kirkwood. The $10K raised through this campaign will be invested in a local
micro-business participating in the Start:ME accelerator. Such capital provides
the fuel needed for an entrepreneur to get their start. Based on past Start:ME
cohorts, EIIG will select from a diverse group of promising enterprises,
including:

Our Plan:


EIIG members will participate in Start:ME program sessions
this Spring to meet with and analyze the cohort of 30 promising micro-entrepreneurs
enrolled in the accelerator.  After
analyzing all the potential ventures, we will select an entrepreneur who we
believe to be an exceptional candidate for a loan investment.



Once the loan has been closed,
the members of EIIG will work with Access to Capital for Entrepreneurs (ACE)
to monitor repayment. That will entail keeping a close eye on cash flows, and
making sure that the loan is being spent appropriately. Above all, we will make
sure that the business model initially presented by the entrepreneur is being effectively implemented.  
Our Vision: 
Once the loan matures and we receive our principal investment
back, we will look to invest in another promising entrepreneur from a future Start:ME program. Eventually we hope to
partner with other accelerator programs and universities to lead multiple
impact investments throughout the Atlanta area.

We asked your questions! Contribute $50+ dollars to ask your very own question to someone over the age of 100!
Update #1!

The campaign has reached $2,300 #4theVolunteers! We wanted to share a thank you from our clients to everyone who has helped so far!


A Little Something Special Our volunteers do a lot for our clients. They deliver Meals on Wheels in the rain and snow. They can be found climbing stairs, navigating traffic and riding elevators all over Waterloo Region. They help seniors and adults with disabilities live in their own homes by getting them the nutrition they need. We want to do something special for them, and we need your help in making it a reality.
This March we launched a $600,000 campaign to build our very own Meals on Wheels kitchen. We are almost there, and need your help with $15,000 for a very special part which will complete the project. The last thing our new home needs is a wonderful place for our volunteers. Help us say thank you with the Volunteer Lounge and Training Room!   A Place for Our Volunteers

We are hoping to raise $15,000 to complete our Volunteer Lounge and Training Room. Money raised will be used for:


Building an accessible washroom
Painting, lighting, and finishing this awesome space
Furnishing the space with tables and couches for volunteers to relax in while they wait for their Meals on Wheels and recover from the elements.


  The Impact



Our volunteers are awesome. We have over 600 of them who our small staff support. Their impact on the community isn't just delivering Meals on Wheels, they also provide exercise classes to seniors, take folks to medical appointments and the grocery store, and visit people isolated in their homes.
This space will be just for them. It will be to celebrate their contributions to our community. 


They help keep people in their own homes and out of overcrowded hospitals and long term care facilities
Sometimes our volunteer's friendly face is the only one seniors will see that day, which is just as important as the meal
Volunteers give of their time which means donations to Community Support Connections - Meals on Wheels and More go directly to client services or our meal subsidy program.
