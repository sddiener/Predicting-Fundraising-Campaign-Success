A making-of documentary to see what goes into the making of a project as 'simple' as a podcast

​When the show comes out, we will be putting out:

If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds will be prioritised this way:

The most expensive part of the show is flying up to Singapore and producing it (we believe the rapport and insights you can get from face-to-face interviews is unparalleled), so funds will first go to our intense 2.5-week production trip

We believe that there are so many amazing and important stories all over Asia that are dying to be heard, but just don't get the airtime or production quality their equivalents in North America or Europe get.

For many Asians, role models in business, tech, politics, art, fashion, literature and music come from the West. That's great, but we know without a doubt that the reason why there aren't as may role models within Asia is not because they don't exist, but because their stories aren't being shared enough! A Life Less Ordinary intends to change that. And from Season 1 in Sri Lanka, we saw that people are thirsty for these stories.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are two men with a firm faith who live with bipolar disorder (bios below). We first met when I (Tony) was launching my book, <i><u><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Delight-Disorder-Ministry-Madness-Mission/dp/0971803889/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511415865&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=delight+in+disorder"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Delight in Disorder</a>.</u></i>  We had both fallen on hard times and agreed to meet weekly for prayer and walks, tears and laughter. Out of these gatherings, a mission was conceived. We developed a faith-based, peer-led mental health support group. ""Faithful Friends"" is still growing strong after three years, without skipping a beat (or a week).</p>
<p>Now, we sense a new mission emerging...</p>
<h3>What We Will Do</h3>
<p>Many people with mental illness feel alienated from faith communities. Many faith communities fail to understand the value of mental health care. We have lived in both worlds and found both to promote healing. Prayer and pills. Worship and therapy. Bible study and support groups. Revealing Voices (the podcast and website) will build a community where people  listen to and dialogue with others who have been impacted by mental illness and struggle with faith. We don't pretend to have <i>the </i>answer, but we will raise your questions and share your prayers. </p>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As important as it is to share our struggles with mental health, prevailing stigma discourages us from doing so. People both within and beyond faith communities often see it as an excuse rather than an explanation; a lack of faith, not a chemical reaction; a crime, not an illness.</p>
<p>Eric and I are uniquely positioned to tackle this stigma head-on. We have both revealed our diagnoses to friends, family, co-workers, and the community at large. At times our method of doing this has lacked good judgement, but we have learned even from these trials. We understand the need for wise discretion for when and how you talk about mental health issues. </p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need your financial support for the equipment needed to produce a quality podcast, including:</p>
<p>* MacBook Pro</p>
<p>* (2) Shure SM-58 microphones</p>
<p>* Cables, stands, accessories</p>
<p>* (2) Headsets</p>
<p>* Equipment for broadcasting phone calls</p>
<p>* Marketing to make a greater impact in a broader area.</p>

<h3>The difference you can make.</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Studies show that at least 20% of the US population struggles with a mental health issue. Research also suggests that very few pastors and churches are equipped to address the needs of persons with mental illness. Your contribution will foster dialogue that offers hope for people who have troubled minds. Hope.  Compassion. With your gifts, you can invest in this vital mission.</p>
<p>If you are not in a position to make a financial gift at this time, we get it. There are other valued ways you can support our mission:</p>
<p>* Pray. Prayer is not a magical panacea to manipulate giving. Yet, through prayer, needs are met.</p>
<p>* Share. Tell others about our project. We'd be delighted if you'd put it on your social media.</p>
<h3>The benefits you receive</h3>
<p>We want to express our gratitude for your support, so we are offering a wide variety of bonuses, from a ""Making of Revealing Voices"" audio recording to signed copies of Delight in Disorder and Watershed. Up to an opportunity to dialogue with us on the show.</p>

</div></div>","Who We Are
We are two men with a firm faith who live with bipolar disorder (bios below). We first met when I (Tony) was launching my book, Delight in Disorder.  We had both fallen on hard times and agreed to meet weekly for prayer and walks, tears and laughter. Out of these gatherings, a mission was conceived. We developed a faith-based, peer-led mental health support group. ""Faithful Friends"" is still growing strong after three years, without skipping a beat (or a week).
Now, we sense a new mission emerging...

<h3>The Show</h3>
<p><i>Inn Between</i> is a fantasy-adventure fiction podcast that focuses on found family, friendship, and the important moments between adventures that help us grow. Our first two seasons were fantastic, but our actors were volunteers, and that's not how we'd like to operate anymore. We're gearing up for our third season, and we need your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are aiming to raise $3000 in order to pay our actors and transcriber a fair wage for their time and work, and to offset other costs. Here's the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>62% is going to our five main actors to record fourteen episodes</li>
<li>12.5% is going to our secondary cast</li>
<li>18.5% is going to our transcriber, who will be in charge of all fourteen episodes plus bonus episode transcripts</li>
<li>7% for other miscellaneous costs, like commissions requests for poster art and the new logo, as well as cloud storage and website upkeep.</li>
</ul>
<p>And for you, we have lots of great perks: stickers, posters, early access to bonus episodes, a 12k-word Jazz Age heist AU of seasons 1&amp;2, and even writing advice or a D&amp;D game with Hannah!</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, everyone will get paid; this is to offset costs on one individual and make sure that all payment is coming through promptly.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Season three will happen no matter what, but with your help, we can ensure a good experience for everyone involved, and make sure Hannah has the time, focus, and energy to make the best possible story. We are so excited to show you what we've got in store, and we want to make it the best season we can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't give at this time? You can also help us by spreading the word! Not just about the crowdfund, although we sure would appreciate that. Tell your friends about the show itself! We could always use more people who listen to and love the show.</p>

<p><i>Night White Skies</i> is looking to grow.  The current podcast is a show about architecture’s future as earth’s environment and our human bodies are now open for design.</p>
<p>Growing the show includes transitioning to seasons as well as providing videos of each recorded conversation while maintaining the availability of the audio podcasts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p><i>Night White Skies</i> began with the goal of integrating current discourse of an evolving climate and human body with the discipline of architecture and design.  The conversations between guests and myself each week are an attempt to foreshadow opportunities and repercussions just on the horizon.  As a professor of architecture that has written and edited several books on the subject matter alongside maintaining a design office of my own, <i>Night White Skies</i> has been a vehicle for communicating and exploring this discourse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What Has Been Done So Far</strong></p>
<p><i>Night White Skies</i> has released nearly 30 episodes in just over the last year as podcasts available on iTunes, Soundcloud and Stitcher.</p>
<p><i>Night White Skies</i> is looking to make a season II, consisting of 12 episodes released each Monday beginning February 5th - April 23rd which will incorporate videos of the conversations as well as continuing to provide the audio podcasts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Needed &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>As you can imagine, a lot of time, effort and funding has gone into developing the show to where it is today (along with a lot of enjoyment on my part).  The goal of this project is to raise the additional funds to cover equipment, editing software &amp; staging to both grow and continue the show.</p>
<p><u>$5,000</u> :  Season 2 (10-12 episodes) available as video episodes on YouTube as well as an audio podcasts, both available each Monday for three months. </p>
<p>Stretch Goals!</p>
<p><u>$10,000</u> :  Straight into season 3…to be released next fall 2018 with another dozen episodes!</p>

<h2>Help Send Jeremy Collins to CrimeCon</h2>
<p>So let's talk a little more about this guy and why we want to help send him to CrimeCon.</p>

<p>Jeremy already has a plan for what he would do at CrimeCon - <strong>snackable audio interviews with so many hosts and listeners, and broadcast as close to live as you can get every day from the convention.</strong>  Plus, his presence there is <i><strong>feet on the street convention research </strong></i>for the upcoming <i><strong>PODCON2018</strong></i> - a convention he started and is now planning with help from listeners and hosts to continue giving us all a place where we can<strong> literally come together, meet podcasters from EVERY GENRE, learn, be entertained,</strong> all in one of the most incredible cities in the country - New Orleans!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's What We Need</h3>
<p>We're looking to surprise Jeremy and cover his CrimeCon Expenses, which we anticipate total $1500.  And we want to be completely transparent with you so we've itemized the costs below.  The cost of event registration reflects a 20% off discount with a podcast coupon code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Event Registration - $400</li>
<li>Airfare - $400</li>
<li>Hotel Accommodations - $500</li>

<h3>What Does This Mean For You?</h3>
<p>Jeremy Collins' wants to go to CrimeCon and bring it back to YOU! There are so many folks who are unable to attend and are asking for videos, audio, photographs, etc.  Many of the podcast hosts attending will be manning our booths at podcast row, attending meet ups and convention activities.  Jeremy will be your feet on the street, and ours, to bring everyone as much as he can from this event.  Plus, what he observes and experiences will shape how we develop and host PODCON2018.</p>
</div><h3>Is there a Risk?</h3><p>Here's the great thing about Indiegogo - they're flexible.  If for some reason we don't raise the entire $1500, Jeremy will still receive whatever we raise to offset his CrimeCon expenses. Any money raised over $1500 will go into the budget for PODCON2018.</p><div> </div></div>","*NOTE:  This campaign may be shared 1:1 via email and DM but not posted to PWLT as it is a surprise.  Please don't spoil the surprise for Jeremy, and we've confirmed he is able to attend.
 
Help Send Jeremy Collins to CrimeCon
So let's talk a little more about this guy and why we want to help send him to CrimeCon.

In a year Jeremy, along with the help of his page admins, grew Podcasts We Listen to from a community of 100 members to almost 8000.  Every day each of us have a place to interact with one another, share our favorite podcasts, and learn about shows we might never otherwise discover.  And he manages to keep us all in line.  He supports listeners, hosts and now with the launch of Podcasts We Listen To, the Podcast, he gives all of us a behind the scenes look into the lives, thoughts, and creative process of some of our favorite podcasters.
Jeremy already has a plan for what he would do at CrimeCon - snackable audio interviews with so many hosts and listeners, and broadcast as close to live as you can get every day from the convention.  Plus, his presence there is feet on the street convention research for the upcoming PODCON2018 - a convention he started and is now planning with help from listeners and hosts to continue giving us all a place where we can literally come together, meet podcasters from EVERY GENRE, learn, be entertained, all in one of the most incredible cities in the country - New Orleans!

Here's What We Need
We're looking to surprise Jeremy and cover his CrimeCon Expenses, which we anticipate total $1500.  And we want to be completely transparent with you so we've itemized the costs below.  The cost of event registration reflects a 20% off discount with a podcast coupon code.

Event Registration - $400
Airfare - $400
Hotel Accommodations - $500
Incidentals - $200

<h3><u>Who am I?</u></h3>
<p>My name is Paul Privitera, I'm the creator and Dungeon Master behind ""Des Moines and Dragons"". I have been playing in / running games of Dungeons and Dragons (DND) since I was 16 years old. Creating stories in this art-form for so long has given me a passion and desire to see the DND community grow and thrive.</p>
<p>I have a degree in Theater from Simpson College. I am currently 5 years into running the oldest Longform Improv team in Des Moines. These achievements have made me an expert at producing live performances.</p>
<h3><u>Who are we?</u></h3>
<p>The cast of Des Moines and Dragons stretches across multiple artistic disciplines to deliver quality content that, before, was only available in audio. With our combined musical, theatrical, and comedic backgrounds our cast is uniquely positioned to make some of the most dynamic DND centered entertainment that is filmed here in Des Moines Iowa.</p>
<p><strong>Charity Coons</strong>- improviser and standup comedian featured in dozens of shows across the metro area</p>
<p><strong>Jason Monroe</strong>- decades performing guitar and music currently in both bands Superchief and Son of the Morning.</p>
<p><strong>Tim Overton</strong>- improv coach and performer, taught college debate and has travelled all across the midwest for comedy.</p>

<h3><u>What are you doing?</u></h3>
<p>Today I'm asking for crowdfunding to secure the resources needed to produce a live show of DND. Being able to have a highly produced and well shot DND Live Show  gives the audience a great piece of content to enjoy, and gives folks who may be interested in the hobby- a reason to jump in and make their own game!</p>

<li>Not only do you get this Custom Character Bust, but you also get a physical copy of the Season Finale Movie Poster sent to you!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>YOUR OWN ONE SHOT</strong></p>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CONTINGENCY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Should we not meet our desired goal we would use what funds we collected to produce the show as best we can. We would reduce the amount of cameras to use a static angle camera shot on the entire cast for the show. This would avoid renting a video switcher.</li>
<li>All additional funds that take us over the Minimum Production Amount will be put into a profit sharing pool. This pool will be divided amongst <u>all</u> the creatives involved in this project to help pay for their time given.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><u>What We Need </u></h3>
<p>Here is how we've calculated costs so you understand why we are asking for funding:</p>
<p>Estimated Total Cost $<b>800</b></p>
<p><strong>Hardware $599</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$<strong>249</strong> BlackMagic ATEM 4K HD Video Switcher</p>
<ul><li><p>This will allow our video producer to switch camera angles on the fly and create an immersive and engaging show</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>$<strong>29/ $145</strong> (<i>each</i>) 5 Sony A6000 Mirrorless Cameras</p>
<ul><li><p>These will be the cameras we use to capture the players, the dice, and the soundbard as we create a live DND show- on the fly!</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>$<strong>26 / $130  </strong>(<i>each</i>) 5 Compatible Lenses for Cameras</p></li>
<li>
<p>$<strong>75</strong><strong> </strong>Show Materials</p>
<ul><li><p>This includes notebooks, set dressing, cables, homemade lighting, and building the background</p></li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Artist Compensation</strong></p>
<ul><li>$<strong>161</strong><ul><li>
<strong>​</strong>Paying good talent is required to producing quality entertainment. We will be paying our video producer first and any extra money will be split evenly among the cast.</li></ul>

<p>$<strong>4</strong><b>0 </b>Art Cards and Posters for Supporters</p>
<ul><li><p>We are getting both the Posters and Supporters printed on high quality paper from Vista Print</p></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign will mean that Des Moines will get it's own place to call Dungeons and Dragons home:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will be able to have bigger and better live events that draw more people</li>
<li>With more people playing DND it'll be easier to find games and play </li>
<li>DSM&amp;D has already produced 3 live shows in the past including 1 at the titular Gary Con in Lake Geneva Wisconsin</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<p>Producing Live Video is extremely difficult. It's partially why the endeavor is so expensive. There are any number of technical issues that can prevent a live video being made on time and without issue.</p>
<p>Part of paying for a Video Producer is to eliminate the risk of equipment failure or glitch. We are all also very experienced live performers with plenty of skill in the arena of ""adapt and overcome"" any obstacle in our way to deliver a top notch quality show.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></h3>
<p>Even if you aren't in a financial position to donate, we can still use your help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.</li>
<li>Use our Indiegogo Share tools to let folks know about this uniquely Des Moines project!</li>

Our artist ""Lawful Mediocre"" has given us a deal for the Indie Gogo Campaign to draw your own character bust! 
Fantasy characters aren't the only thing this talented artist can draw! He can take whatever character you want drawn and give them his unique touch to produce a truly original piece! You could even request a rendering of your best friend to make for a one of a kind gift!
Not only do you get this Custom Character Bust, but you also get a physical copy of the Season Finale Movie Poster sent to you!

YOUR OWN ONE SHOT

​If the idea of DM'ing isn't your thing, why not have Paul Dungeon Master a game for you? With this reward you get a full One Shot session for you and 3 friends to play whatever characters you want in whatever world you want.
You too will get access to the DSM&D slack where you and other Dungeon Master's can hangout, ask questions, and participate in world building for the show.

 
CONTINGENCY

Should we not meet our desired goal we would use what funds we collected to produce the show as best we can. We would reduce the amount of cameras to use a static angle camera shot on the entire cast for the show. This would avoid renting a video switcher.
All additional funds that take us over the Minimum Production Amount will be put into a profit sharing pool. This pool will be divided amongst all the creatives involved in this project to help pay for their time given.

 
What We Need 
Here is how we've calculated costs so you understand why we are asking for funding:
Estimated Total Cost $800
Hardware $599


$249 BlackMagic ATEM 4K HD Video Switcher
This will allow our video producer to switch camera angles on the fly and create an immersive and engaging show


$29/ $145 (each) 5 Sony A6000 Mirrorless Cameras
These will be the cameras we use to capture the players, the dice, and the soundbard as we create a live DND show- on the fly!

$26 / $130  (each) 5 Compatible Lenses for Cameras

$75 Show Materials
This includes notebooks, set dressing, cables, homemade lighting, and building the background


Artist Compensation
$161
​Paying good talent is required to producing quality entertainment. We will be paying our video producer first and any extra money will be split evenly among the cast.

Rewards $40

$40 Art Cards and Posters for Supporters
We are getting both the Posters and Supporters printed on high quality paper from Vista Print

 

The Impact
Your contribution to this campaign will mean that Des Moines will get it's own place to call Dungeons and Dragons home:

We will be able to have bigger and better live events that draw more people
With more people playing DND it'll be easier to find games and play 
DSM&D has already produced 3 live shows in the past including 1 at the titular Gary Con in Lake Geneva Wisconsin

 

Risks & Challenges
Producing Live Video is extremely difficult. It's partially why the endeavor is so expensive. There are any number of technical issues that can prevent a live video being made on time and without issue.
Part of paying for a Video Producer is to eliminate the risk of equipment failure or glitch. We are all also very experienced live performers with plenty of skill in the arena of ""adapt and overcome"" any obstacle in our way to deliver a top notch quality show.

<h3>What <i>are</i> we doing?</h3>
<p>Whimsic Productions is bringing you <i>two </i>new podcasts!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Dungeons &amp; Drimbus</i>: An actual-play D&amp;D podcast guaranteed to be full of hilarious characters, absurd mistakes, and plenty of laughs.</li>
<li>
<i>Should I Buy It, Though?</i>: A review podcast where video game enthusiasts of varying degrees, skill levels, and preferences come together to decide whether the newest releases (or the occasional classic) is worth your hard-earned coin.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're a bunch of geeky actors looking to bring you quality content, whether that be through becoming fantastical characters or giving our open and honest opinions on why Metal Gear Solid V is fantastic and Nick Palazzo is out of his mind if he thinks that Yakuza... we'll talk about that later. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why are we asking you for money to play pretend?</h3>
<p>We're going to be doing what we love and sharing it with you. After every game we play, <strong>there's always a moment of wishing someone had thought to record the absurdity that ensued</strong> that evening. To actually do that and put it into a polished high quality podcast, we need to cover our initial costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial set up includes purchasing domain names, necessary recording equipment, and other software we need</li>
<li>As a video game review podcast striving to provide timely reviews, <i>Should I Buy It, Though?</i> will often have a usual upfront cost of ~$60 per person. We want to make sure you're only spending money on games worth buying! But that means we have to buy them first and that can add up week after week</li>
<li>Additional funds will go towards further improving the productions by allowing us to spend on:<ul>
<li>Hiring actual artists for cover art, music (what's a high stakes mer-person duel in space without some ambiance?), logos, etc.</li>
<li>Purchasing of further required equipment and software (better editing tools, sound-proofing, new platforms and upcoming games, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What do you get for backing us?</h3>
<p>Well, primarily our gratitude and two really great podcasts! But, we've put some thought into meaningful rewards we can offer to make our backers feel like a part of the fun. Additionally, we know not everyone may be interested in both shows, so we've made custom tiers that let you interact with your preferred production in fun, meaningful ways. We want to hear from you and incorporate the community into our work, so you can bet we'll be finding ways to do that even after this campaign is over.</p>
<ul>
<li>Become our founding fathers (daddies?)! Or mothers. Our founding parents. By being generous enough to fund our silly ideas you'll get a special shout out in the credits of the show and our website. </li>
<li>Each show has ways you can influence the content we'll be making<ul>
<li>For <i>Dungeons &amp; Drimbus</i>, we'll be launching with a special one-off campaign that will allow all of your suggestions to wreck havoc on our fantasy world. Namely, absurdly generous donors will get to <strong>build the characters we play</strong> and maybe even join us! And we get absolutely no say in the matter. Other rewards include having an NPC named after you (or anything of your choosing) and - for our full length campaign - the limited opportunity to fund a <strong>secret objective known only by you and the assigned player</strong>. </li>
<li>For <i>Should I Buy It, Though?</i>  various reward tiers will grant you access to exclusive content and the ability to decide what we're going to play. You will of course be honored as Founding Parent here as well, but other rewards include <strong>access to donor-exclusive livestreams</strong> as we play the games we are reviewing, the ability to<strong> choose what game we play and review</strong> for an episode, and even the chance to <strong>play with us and come on the show</strong>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We think these rewards are really exciting and we're hoping to get build and interact with our community here. If you have thoughts on something you'd really like to see in the future, please get in touch! We'll be looking to build on this in the future to make our content feel a little more like a conversation with all of you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>When does any of this start?</h3>
<p><i>Right now!</i> Our first episode of <i>Should I Buy It, Though?  </i>is available as you're reading this. We have defined purposes for both our shows. With <i>Should I Buy</i>, we really want to help you determine if that shiny new game is a good value proposition. We understand, as with anything, video games are a matter of taste so you can't just blindly take our word for it. That's why we've put together a group with varied interests to walk you through their thoughts. Episode 1 is an introduction so you can get to know us, our tastes, and how the show will work moving forward</p>
<p>As for <i>Dungeons &amp; Drimbus</i>, we are currently hard at work building the world and characters you'll get to meet very soon. We want to make sure everything is clearly defined and our house rules are in order, so we'll be taking some more time with that. Our main campaign will be DM'd by <i>Nick Benetatos</i> and will follow an episodic structure as we progress throughout the campaign. But, <i>Giancarlo Herrera</i> will be DMing our first episode in a one-off that you will get the chance to shape (and be a part of) with your contributions! That first episode will drop in July, shortly after this campaign ends followed by the beginning of our main arc.</p>
<p>Until then, you've got the first episode of <i>Should I Buy It, Though?</i>  followed by our review of The Last of Us Part II later this month, so we'll be sure not to keep you waiting.</p>

Whimsic Productions is bringing you two new podcasts!


Dungeons & Drimbus: An actual-play D&D podcast guaranteed to be full of hilarious characters, absurd mistakes, and plenty of laughs.

Should I Buy It, Though?: A review podcast where video game enthusiasts of varying degrees, skill levels, and preferences come together to decide whether the newest releases (or the occasional classic) is worth your hard-earned coin.

We're a bunch of geeky actors looking to bring you quality content, whether that be through becoming fantastical characters or giving our open and honest opinions on why Metal Gear Solid V is fantastic and Nick Palazzo is out of his mind if he thinks that Yakuza... we'll talk about that later. 

Why are we asking you for money to play pretend?
We're going to be doing what we love and sharing it with you. After every game we play, there's always a moment of wishing someone had thought to record the absurdity that ensued that evening. To actually do that and put it into a polished high quality podcast, we need to cover our initial costs:

Initial set up includes purchasing domain names, necessary recording equipment, and other software we need

Additional funds will go towards further improving the productions by allowing us to spend on:

The tactic not only works in anear-candy sense but also helps orient the listenerand make the fights easier to follow: latching ontoa familiar rhythm or melody makes everythingfeel less chaotic.""~ Podcast ProblemsBelow you will find a compilation of the three fightscenes we created for Untypical's first episode.  The team behind Untypical is called EAST Corp Productions, and we've been making Audio Dramas for almost four years. Our longest running, most popular, series, Confessions of a Wasteland Pony has been running since 2014 and we have since added to that with a roster of stories such as Terminal Secrets, The Wasteland Survival Guide and now, of course,  Untypical. 

 Untypical is made possible by a talented and diverse cast and crew, who range from new, talented voices to multi-award winning and experienced Voice Artists, writers and Filmmakers.  WritersJames Vermont - Lead WriterJames is an award-winning South African filmmaker with several audio dramas, films and TV shows under his belt. He has been honing his penmanship all his life and has spent the last 6 years working freelance as a writer. Wendy Crescent - WriterWendy Crescent is an upcoming author of romantic fiction from the Netherlands. She has spent 3 years honing her craft writing fan-fiction and original fiction, specializing in writing romance stories that cover adult themes in a mature manner. She has published a total of 23 pieces of fan-fiction and is currently working to finish her first novel.Ian Van Der Walt - WriterIan van der Walt was a stationary procurement temp who knows nothing about storytelling. One day he bumps into James Vermont, and makes an offhanded reference to his love for the cult flick ""Heat Vision."" Now he is stuck here and doesn't know how to get out.CastNeedle Stitch - Jessica""The instant Needle Stitch's protagonist came on the scene, I was sold""~ Elena Fernandez-CollinsNeedle Stitch joined EAST Corp voicing the lead in our ""Wasteland Survival Guide"" series despite it being her very first attempt at Voice Acting. Since then she has landed leading roles in several EAST Corp Productions such as Terminal Secrets and Untypical, eventually stepping in and working on the organizational elements of several productions and earning her place as the fourth permanent producer at EAST Corp.Julia Morizawa - DelilahJulia Morizawa is a Los Angeles based actor with extensive experience in film, television, theatre, web series and podcasts. Career highlights include the feature films Judas Kiss and Tied Up; TV appearances on Lewis Black's The Root of all Evil and ER; the title role in East West Players' production of Masha No Home; series regular roles on the web series Star Trek: Odyssey and Frontier Guard; and the lead role in the narrative podcast The Bright Sessions.Dusty Rhoades - The CouncilmanSmack dab in the tenor range, Dusty’s voice is that warm stack of pancakes on a cold Sunday morning. He has Audiobooks as well as characters in his resume.Mr. Creepypasta - Benjamin QuietMr. CreepyPasta is a popular reader of mature, terrifying stories. He finds great joy in giving his audience tales of terror in the audio format and has been plying his voice-fueled trade for many years.Obab Scribbler - LucilleScribbler has been creating content online for over ten years and has proven herself as a fanfic writer, audiobook reader and confirmed geek. Also a book lover. And a comic book nerd. Ooh, ooh, and an Anime fan. Also, easily distracted by shiny things.Cinder Script - PhadeA few years of silly voices at work and some mild shenanigans involving a shipment of wholesale rubber ducks, and she decided to give voice acting a try. Now she's shouting into a microphone in the most metrosexual manner possible. Eager to blow your minds (and chew the scenery,) Cinder Script voices the crazy awesome Phade and his mysterious and totally-not-a-ghost companion Zoe Yu. Enjoy the Chaos, its gonna be one heck of a lightshow!Madeline Goshorn - KhoraMadeline plays the voice of Khora, the large motherly polar bear mayor, better watch out son. She is a pursuing voice actress living in LA and has been studying and practicing for nearly five years.Cayla Simpson - MiraCayla Simpson is a twenty-year-old South African film student with ten years of vocal training and desire to add music to her resume. She uses this training to voice Mira the dragon, as well as a few other East Corp characters. In January 2017 we started a Patreon, which provided enough budget for Untypical's first episode.... over the course of 10 months. Naturally, we don't want to spend the next year and a half funding the two remaining episodes of this first season so this campaign exists to expedite the process.  EPISODE 2 - DAY ZEROA mission gone wrong leaves the crew of The Dancer staring directly at their past selves, forcing them to confront who they used to be and what they’ve had to lose of themselves in order to survive. Our heroes watch the day the world changed. EPISODE 3 - AFROPUNKJessica, Khora, and Delilah have lived interesting lives across the last 20 years. But not all of their adventures had happy endings and not everyone who has crossed their paths has left them with a positive experience. Afropunk sees the crew of The Dancer chases an old friend in an attempt to heal wounds and deal with past mistakes. This leads them to The New African Pride, the changed continent of Africa which has now become the sci-fi inspired powerhouse of The Twisting World. BONUS EPISODE 1&2(Dependant on stretch goals)We step away from the crew of The Dancer and tell two self contained stories set elsewhere in The Twisting World with the goal of providing you a different glimpse at the expansive and imaginative universe we have created. EPISODE 4 - FUTUREGIRL(Dependant on stretch goals)The most powerful people in The Twisting World are the Scions, remnants of a magical community whose ability to manipulate the magic within matter has ascended them to near godhood. However a young Scion has boarded The Dancer with the hopes of fleeing her people to live in Stonetown.Jessica and her crew must reach Stonetown before the other nations and factions of The Twisting World capture the Scion and harness her power for themselves. In any production, there are bound to be challenges, which means there are always risks for potential backers. 
What if you don't complete the episodes? Our team is being led by experienced filmmakers who havecompleted multiple projects over several years. We are confidentin our ability to see this through to the end. 

What if the project is delayed? Delays can happen, as large-scale productions can be quite complicated. Those of you who have listened to our pilot episode have an idea of howin-depth and complicated we've made our lives. The pilot was completed 3 weeks prior to our original estimate of date, however, if we are met with a delay in production we will be certain tocommunicate that very clearly with our backers. 

Any other risks you wanna share with us, buddy?Like many audio dramas, our production team is scattered around theworld, with members in Europe, Southern Africa, and North America. This can createissues of contacting each other, organizing meetings and keeping a tightproduction schedule. Most of our team, especially the leadership, have worked on productions likethis in the past, and have been able to work through these issues. 

 STRETCH GOALS$2300Bonus Episode 1The first of two bonus episodes which step away from the primary castand explore self-contained stories elsewhere in The Twisting World.$2600Bonus Episode 2The second of the two bonus episodes which will continue the process oftelling more self-contained, experimental stories.$3400Full New Episode - FuturegirlThe most powerful people in The Twisting World are the Scions, remnants of a magical community whose ability to manipulate the magic within matter has ascended them to near godhood. However a young Scion has boarded The Dancer with the hopes of fleeing her people to live in Stonetown.Jessica and her crew must reach Stonetown before the other nations and factions of The Twisting World capture the Scion and harness her power for themselves.$4300Increased Music BudgetWe will increase the music budget to include fight scene songs composed from scratch that incorporate the fight sound effects as if they were instruments for a more refined and directed experience.$5100Choose Your Own AdventureAre you a fan of Choose Your Own Adventure stories? Well, we are! Vermont has been looking for an excuse to make one for the longest time and this is how he is justifying it.

<h3>About our Podcast</h3>
<p>No Homo takes a unique, comedic approach to current LGBTQ issues. In mainstream media, we always see queer stories presented as tragic and negative, and while these stories are not to be ignored, No Homo aims to take a different angle on the queer experience and make light of some of the negative issues we are exposed to daily. We tell real, raw stories and give our thoughts on the LBGTQ world of today based on our own experiences growing up as closeted homosexuals. We aim to make people laugh and help those just coming to terms with their sexuality understand that the journey they are about to embark on is much less scary than it may seem at first.</p>
<p>On the show, we discuss current topics of the gay pop culture and politics, play games, tell stories from our own unique gay perspectives, and interview others to learn about their experiences.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>Mike and Jenny share a deep curiosity about the world around us. We were drawn to each other as we asked each other why humans act the way they do and what makes landscapes change. The Green River was the start of our story: We met on this river while teaching outdoor education. We have maintained a desire to see this river from source to sea as we want this river system to continue to be a part of our story. Our curiosity has drawn us to hear and collect the stories of others who are connected to this river. </p>
<p>The One River Project will connect the wild headwaters of the Green/Colorado River in the Wind River Range of Wyoming, to the Gulf of California in Sonora, by boat. Along the way, Mike and Jenny will explore what wild rivers mean to people through scheduled interviews and serendipitous engagements, contributing to the 50th Anniversary of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and adding a chapter to the stories surrounding the beloved and exploited Colorado River. The team will record audio and film conversations with diverse stakeholders while traveling through WY, CO, UT, AZ and MX entirely under human power, primarily in a purpose-built whitewater dory. We have three goals in mind. First, to celebrate free-flowing rivers by collecting people’s stories through writing, sound, and film. Secondly, to connect people to the Green and Colorado rivers, each other and public lands, sharing insights and changes in the river though stories, observations, interviews, and interactive mapping. And lastly, to explore the protection of intact, free-flowing rivers and innovative solutions to water conflict. </p>
<p>Your contribution to our journey will fund the technical tools necessary to collect stories. Mike and Jenny have been doing expeditions both personally and professionally over the last 20 years. Through our experiences, we know what outdoor gear will be most effective to get us down the river. Over the last two  years, we have been planning, building and collecting these necessary items. We have used our own funds for the majority of this collection along with some help from sponsors. What we do not have is the equipment needed to capture the stories in the professional quality that these stories deserve. Your donation will help us purchase the following items:</p>
<p>- Digital recorder and microphone</p>
<p>- Mirrorless Digital Camera</p>
<p>- POV Camera</p>
<p>- Memory Cards</p>
<p>- Batteries</p>
<p>- Waterproof Cases</p>
<p>- Hard Drive</p>
<p>- Tri-Pod</p>
<p>- Solar Charging Capability </p>
<p>- Fuel/Food/Transportation Costs</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $5000.00 to acquire the necessary equipment listed above. </p>
<p><strong>What do you get out donating? </strong></p>
<p>Your donation will help to capture photos, stories, high quality sound for pod-casts and professional resolution for film. Your efforts will help us effective document this journey in order to help connect others to this important river system and the people who live there. </p>
<p>As an incentive, if you donate $50.00, we'll send a 10 pack of postcards with images from our expedition. Also, for every additional $50 you donate, you will have the choice of an 8x10 photo from our gallery of photos we collect along the journey. These perks will be available when we complete the journey - so you should get them around March of 2019. </p>

<p>We are not the first to make this trip from source to sea on the Colorado (though there have been few), nor are we the first to catalogue stories along the way. We might be the first though, to explore the issues of climate change, development and water scarcity through podcasts while traveling source to sea, which will help conservationists, water managers, researchers and public officials find socially supportable solutions to the problem. The physical and biological needs of healthy Colorado River System are known and emerging, but the social solutions to get there have not yet been fully formed. This project will help to change that.</p>
<p>We are the right ones to tell the story because not only do we know, love and have lived in multiple areas from the headwaters to the Lower Colorado deserts, but we also have the technical, storytelling, social science and conservation experience to complete this project in an intelligent, sensitive and insightful way. We will be able to engage people along the river corridor, meeting them where they are.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Having experience as professional guides as well as personal expeditions over the last 20 years, we are both fully aware of the risks involved in a journey like this. We are aware that we may not finish. This is something we both do not want to happen, as we both like to finish what we start. However we understand that it is highly possible to experience injury, illness or a natural disaster such as a flash flood. Both Mike and Jenny have maintained an updated Wilderness First Responder for the last 15 years. Mike is a Whitewater Rescue Technician and has been a river guide for 20+ years. Both Mike and Jenny taught for the National Outdoor Leadership School. Together, Mike and Jenny have over 18,000 river miles from their journey and work. This accounts for hundreds of days and nights on the river... and this is just our river experience.</p>
<p>We are an efficient team, especially in the backcountry. We have encountered and effectively assisted in managing injury with students, friends and each other. Every other year, we spend 3 days practicing wilderness medicine and learn about the most effective and up to date treatment. If we experience a situation on the river, we will talk about and come up with the most effective and reasonable plan for the situation. </p>
</div><p>This ask is not easy for us. We have worked hard together to achieve our goals without asking for much outside help. We have put off this ask for over a year because both of us feel ""weird"" about publicly announcing an ask for help. We completely understand if you can't assist us financially.

<h2><strong>Why This Story? </strong></h2>
<p>Well first, there's the obvious reason: several members of this team are RAs, and RAs are hilarious. But there's more.</p>
<p>Many of us on the team have recently graduated, while others will be graduating very soon. All of us have been asked MANY TIMES, ""What are your plans after graduation?"" Concealing the existential dread is difficult. </p>
<p>While college is a time of exciting opportunities, it often feels like every decision made could determine your entire future. It's very frightening. Worse, it's difficult for us not to constantly compare ourselves to others. ""This celebrity directed three films when they were my age? I must be behind."" </p>
<p><i>Childish </i>is the story of characters who are all smack in the middle of this formative time of their lives. Constantly comparing themselves to others and worrying how they are perceived by their peers, they live their lives with an endless search for validation. We can relate.</p>
<h2>Why A Podcast Musical?</h2>
<p>Show creators Ryan Dorsey and Zachary Goldberg have spent the better part of their college careers working in and experimenting with audio production. Whether sound designing films, working at their university radio station, or managing their student-run podcast network, Whale Bus, the team has enjoyed discovering and inventing new ways to tell stories through audio. Audio isn't just film without visuals; <i>audio is its very own storytelling medium. </i></p>
<p>The only thing Dorsey and Goldberg enjoy more than telling stories through audio is working with an incredible team of other artists to make it happen. Some members of the Childish team love musicals, others love rap, and all come from wonderfully diverse backgrounds, bringing with them their own unique perspectives and experiences. A podcast musical seemed like the natural next step in the Whale Bus story. </p>

<h3>Why does this Diner have Robots? Who are we?</h3>
<p>We're two teens living, working, and studying in San Antonio; <strong>Mike</strong> and <strong>Eduardo</strong>. More than a podcast, we're a form of audible advocacy, for the worker, for the downtrodden, for the starving, huddled masses to which our country is supposed to be a <strong>shining beacon</strong> to the world.</p>
<p>When I say <strong>we</strong>, I'm referring to the small team of <strong>young, low-income, college-age men and women</strong> interested in affecting progressive change who make this podcast possible. We believe in <strong>the America of the</strong> <strong><i>future</i></strong>, one where poverty has been ameliorated and where we can live to our fullest potential. In this future - when we, the young people, are old and gray - <strong>can we meet again, maybe at a diner no longer serviced by humans, and look back on this moment knowing we fought for what was right?</strong> Or will we regret never pressing our leaders to work only for the <strong>people</strong>? Will we have become those very leaders? We look forward to that congregation, at that 'robot-diner,' where we can indeed smile on this moment. And we hope you'll join us there.</p>
</div><div>
<ul></ul>
<h3>We already have three guests lined up.</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Akhenaten Hotep Amun</strong> is running for the U.S. Senate in Georgia.</li>
<li>
<strong>Jensen Bohren</strong> is running for the U.S. Senate in Mississippi.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lorena Garcia </strong>is running for the U.S. Senate in Colorado.</li>
</ol>
<p>All three of these candidates have already agreed to be on our podcast. They may not be the front runners, and they may not make waves. But they each have a story to tell, and a vision for their respective states and for the future of this country. <strong>They deserve to be heard.</strong></p>
<h3>The Diner needs your cash money.</h3>
<p>We would be truly grateful if you contributed. Here's what your money will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two <strong>microphones</strong> - $240</li>
<li>One <strong>wind screen</strong> for the microphone - $30</li>
<li>One year business subscription on <strong>Squarespace</strong> - $216</li>
<li>
<strong>Taxes &amp; shipping</strong> - $14</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it, that's all we need. $500 in total to launch by October 2019.</p>
<h3>What comes next?</h3>
<p>We plan on having guests at all levels - for city council, county, parish, <strong>mayoral</strong>, judicial, and law enforcement candidates - for U.S. Senate, U.S. House, and <strong>President of the United States</strong> - for state representative, state senate, gubernatorial, and <strong>statewide</strong> offices - and even for special districts.</p>
<p>How will we entice these guests to come on our show? The same as a snowball. If we can be entertaining enough and can attract enough lower-tier candidates, then we can begin to attract candidates of a higher and higher caliber, until we have the ear of candidates for the highest office in the land, just so that we can ask them if they will perpetuate the status-quo.</p>

<p>The wonder of martial arts and combat sports is nothing if you can not experience it. While I am not getting younger it becomes increasingly difficult to invest into enough training in combat sports. This is an opportunity to experience a Martial Arts Journey by doing intensive training in MMA, to document and share my experience and discovery.</p>
<p>I will need finances to journey to Portland, USA - the famous SBG Portland gym  lead by Matt Thornton, where I will participate in the ""Wimp 2 Warrior"" program for 22 weeks, at which of the end I would engage in an amateur MMA fight.</p>
<p>The ""Wimp 2 Warrior"" program is designed to give an intensive MMA training experience to regular people to help them feel the transformation that mixed martial arts may offer. My plan is to fully participate in the program and document my journey.  I will also be collecting the best possible information about combat sports and martial arts, conducting interviews and more.</p>
<p>The finances are necessary to cover:<br/>• Flight expenditures<br/>• Daily expenditures<br/>• Participation fees<br/>For the whole six months.</p>
<p>I am also ready to offer any extra rewards for people who will support me. Just let me know what rewards you'd like, for example: extra videos, live google hangouts or anything else.</p>
<p>The program starts at October 6th and ends in March. I will need initial finances already by end of September to manage the trip.</p>
<p>This will be a life changing experience and I hope that with your support I will be able to share all of it with you.</p>

<h3>Radar Radio History</h3>
<p>Radar Radio was formed in early 2015 and continued on through 2017. Here on Radar Radio, we interviewed many artists and offered 30 minute episodes per interview. The musicians we interviewed reached all forms of genres from pop, rock, hip-hop, jazz, country, and more. They came from all over the world through in-person and Skype interviews just for our show. Our goal was to showcase talented musicians who hadn't quite broken through to the mainstream field to have been played on the radio. I have always been incredibly passionate about finding people who are talented and who I believe the world needs to see and/or hear. With all the talent out there in the world, the radio really only covers what seems like about 15% of musical talent, up-and-coming or not. The music industry is definitely a hard industry to break through, and we wanted to help in whatever way we could to reach as many people as we could to help these up-and-comers gain some ground. We've had thousands of plays and hundreds of subscribers with just word of mouth and through social media advertising. </p>
<h3>So What Happened? </h3>
<p>In truth, a lack of financial support happened. This is a passion project and majority of the finances were coming from of my own pocket, and it costs more than you may think. If you're curious about what I mean, I'll explain more when I break down the costs below. It got to the point where I just couldn't afford funding Radar Radio on my own anymore. With working a full time job and also taking classes, there was little to no time left to work on and clean up the episodes and interviews, as they take hours to fix up for your listening pleasure. I personally wasn't able to put my all into making the podcast what I knew it could be, and that didn't feel right. I decided to put Radar Radio on a temporary and indefinite hiatus back in 2017. It's been about a year since the initial hiatus, and I've spent that time regrouping and figuring out where I want the podcast to pick up from here on out. I love Radar Radio with my whole heart, and I would love nothing more than to be able to continue it, showcasing even more talented people, musicians, and various artists. I am fully committed to getting Radar Radio back up and running, but I do need some help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where Do We Go From Here?</h3>
<p>I want to bring Radar Radio back, and I'd like to bring it back better than ever. This includes brand new concepts, a new aesthetic, and even a new name (to be revealed at a later date). We are ready to come back better and stronger than before, and that also means we would be moving on from just musicians. There are so many brilliant forms of art out there, why should we limit ourselves only to music? We're talking all forms of entertainment: musicians, actors, writers, directors, artists, animators, and so much more. I believe we can absolutely accomplish this ambitious vision by bringing in new additions to our creative team. Don't worry, friends, everything may be changing, but the core of Radar Radio still remains: We are passionate about passionate artists and we just want to share their passions with you. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>As of right now, we really can't offer you very much. What we can offer is our greatest thanks to you for listing your name on our website as a supporter of Radar Radio, and we pledge to you our undying gratitude. </p>
<h3><strong>The Breakdown of Costs</strong></h3>

</div></div>","Radar Radio History
Radar Radio was formed in early 2015 and continued on through 2017. Here on Radar Radio, we interviewed many artists and offered 30 minute episodes per interview. The musicians we interviewed reached all forms of genres from pop, rock, hip-hop, jazz, country, and more. They came from all over the world through in-person and Skype interviews just for our show. Our goal was to showcase talented musicians who hadn't quite broken through to the mainstream field to have been played on the radio. I have always been incredibly passionate about finding people who are talented and who I believe the world needs to see and/or hear. With all the talent out there in the world, the radio really only covers what seems like about 15% of musical talent, up-and-coming or not. The music industry is definitely a hard industry to break through, and we wanted to help in whatever way we could to reach as many people as we could to help these up-and-comers gain some ground. We've had thousands of plays and hundreds of subscribers with just word of mouth and through social media advertising. 
So What Happened? 
In truth, a lack of financial support happened. This is a passion project and majority of the finances were coming from of my own pocket, and it costs more than you may think. If you're curious about what I mean, I'll explain more when I break down the costs below. It got to the point where I just couldn't afford funding Radar Radio on my own anymore. With working a full time job and also taking classes, there was little to no time left to work on and clean up the episodes and interviews, as they take hours to fix up for your listening pleasure. I personally wasn't able to put my all into making the podcast what I knew it could be, and that didn't feel right. I decided to put Radar Radio on a temporary and indefinite hiatus back in 2017. It's been about a year since the initial hiatus, and I've spent that time regrouping and figuring out where I want the podcast to pick up from here on out. I love Radar Radio with my whole heart, and I would love nothing more than to be able to continue it, showcasing even more talented people, musicians, and various artists. I am fully committed to getting Radar Radio back up and running, but I do need some help.

Where Do We Go From Here?
I want to bring Radar Radio back, and I'd like to bring it back better than ever. This includes brand new concepts, a new aesthetic, and even a new name (to be revealed at a later date). We are ready to come back better and stronger than before, and that also means we would be moving on from just musicians. There are so many brilliant forms of art out there, why should we limit ourselves only to music? We're talking all forms of entertainment: musicians, actors, writers, directors, artists, animators, and so much more. I believe we can absolutely accomplish this ambitious vision by bringing in new additions to our creative team. Don't worry, friends, everything may be changing, but the core of Radar Radio still remains: We are passionate about passionate artists and we just want to share their passions with you. 

The Perks
As of right now, we really can't offer you very much. What we can offer is our greatest thanks to you for listing your name on our website as a supporter of Radar Radio, and we pledge to you our undying gratitude. 
The Breakdown of Costs
In truth, this kind of thing probably costs more than people think. There are a lot of finances that do add up over time. While we do conduct interviews over Skype due to location on occasion, we try to do most interviews in person, and the cost of travel adds up very quickly (you'll understand especially if you know how long it takes to get around in LA). There are pricey editing programs we use to trim our episodes and clean up the quality of the audio, leasing fees in order to have enough bandwidth on the websites we use to conveniently hold all the episodes in one place, and so much more. I also do not take any sort of personal revenue and neither does my (amazing) team.

Thank you for taking the time to hear us out, take us into consideration, and for possibly giving us a small donation. I appreciate all of you more than you could know. And, if you aren't able help by donating, liking our Facebook page would definitely help. Thanks to all of you again, and please share this post to get the word out!

<p>In 2017 icon of British science fiction, DAN DARE, dramatically returned to the airwaves over six all-new audio adventures featuring acclaimed performances from Ed Stoppard (Dan Dare), Geoff McGivern (Digby), Heida Reed (Professor Peabody), Michael Cochrane (Sir Hurbert) and Raad Rawi (The Mekon) along with many notable guest stars including Hugh Fraser, Noof McEwan, Bijan Daneshmand and Jonathan Rhodes.</p>
<p>Inspired by the original Eagle comic strip (1950-1967), B7 Media’s audio reboot of comic-book space hero DAN DARE was hailed by fans and critics alike - and the first season was also nominated for several radio awards. Most notably Vol 2 won the prestigious NYC International Radio Program Gold Award for ‘Best Digital Drama’ (2018).</p>
<p>We’re very proud of what we accomplished; the fulfilment of a 25-year old ambition of producer/director Andrew Mark Sewell. Over the last 18-months we've also been delighted to receive many, many requests for further adventures - which is why we've launched this crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>We want DAN DARE’s audio adventure to continue but we also need your support to fund production of a new, action-packed season of stories once again pitting Dan Dare and his crew against the Mekon - and other menaces, too!</p>

<p>Our writers, cast and production team have more exciting Dan Dare stories to tell – the storylines have already been scripted for a new trilogy of stories (the first being ‘All Treens Must Die’.) 2020 makes the 70th anniversary of the ‘Pilot of the Future’ so releasing Vol 3, a new season of three exciting stories, would be a fitting tribute to complete the Dan Dare story arc we set in motion with Season 1.</p>

<p>Our initial plan is to fund and produce the first episode (see below) and release it digitally. If there's sufficient demand and interest, we will go onto crowdfund subsequent episodes and as the stakes increase, so will the perks!</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to fund the development, scripting, production and post-production of Vol Three in its entirety, boasting 3 x 75-minute adventures. The total budget for this is £45,000. Reaching further goals will allow us to commission scripts for Volume Four, commission more episodes and produce a special drama revealing the astonishing ‘true’ story behind the creation of Dan Dare by Frank Hampson and the Reverend Marcus Morris.</p>

<p><strong>ALL TREENS MUST DIE</strong> written by Colin Brake</p>
<p>Dan Dare has finally captured his arch-enemy and brought The Mekon to Earth to face trial for crimes against humanity. Despite Dare’s victory, however, these are troubled times on Earth. In the Reconstruction after the devastating invasion told in the first season adventure ""Reign of the Robots"", most menial tasks are now undertaken by refugee alien Treens. Many humans are hostile to and resentful of these aliens “taking their jobs”. Discontent is rumbling and, although defeated, the Mekon has a plan. When Treens loyal to the Mekon break him free, Dare and his team (Digby and Professor Peabody) are forced back into action to save not one world, but two as the Mekon’s twisted ideology of racial purity leads him to attack his own people, declaring, “All Treens Must Die...”</p>
<p><strong>OPERATION DARK STAR</strong> written by Colin Brake</p>
<p>Dan Dare and Digby join Dare’s Uncle Ivor, on a mission to follow the route taken by Dare’s missing father, Frank Dare, in the ill-fated Orion Orbiter. Their destination - the <i>Dark Star</i> hidden near Pluto, which guards a stable Einstein-Rosen bridge: a wormhole through space/time. Meanwhile, Peabody, tasked by Sir Hubert of Space Fleet to investigate Eagle Corp, discovers evidence of secret off-the-books research being carried out by their old enemy, the mad scientist Blasco, using the <i>Dark Star</i> station as his base of operations. But before Peabody can warn Dare of the danger, Ivor – still struggling to find his own identity in the shadow of his famous brother – betrays his nephew to join Blasco’s cause. With all apparently lost, only Peabody can save Dare but she has her own, much more personal, crisis to deal with...</p>
<p><strong>TERRA NOVA</strong> written by Colin Brake</p>
<p>Travelling through the time distortions of the Dark Star wormhole, Dare and his friends are joined by an unexpected stowaway - Cadet “Flamer” Spry. They reach Terra Nova (the alien planet Dare’s father found years ago) now the last planet holding out against the Vora’s apparently unstoppable advance across the known universe. It’s been completely ravaged by war and the Vora is about to launch a final assault. Learning that his father is being held a prisoner by the Vora, Dare attempts a rescue but ends up captured and thrown in a cell along with another prisoner: a defeated and despondent Mekon. Dare has to persuade his former enemy that together they can escape and defeat the Vora once and for all. But with the Vora’s mighty battle fleet already advancing towards the wormhole to attack Earth, will Dare and the Mekon’s desperate union succeed? Or will this prove to be Dan Dare’s final adventure?</p>

<ul>
<li>On completion of the trilogy, an exclusive Limited Edition 70th Anniversary copy of the Dan Dare audio series in full. These limited edition packages will not be made available in shops or online stores so will be a ‘must have’ for any Dan Dare aficionado.</li>

<li>Brian Williamson has drawn some stunning new artwork to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Dan Dare, which we’ll  print up as classic sized movie posters and if you asked nicely, he’ll even personally sign them!</li>

<p>At B7 Media we’re known for our love of the science fiction genre and our particular brand of Audio Movies. We’ve dramatised for audio everything from the cult BBC sci-fi series <i>Blake’s 7</i> (BBC Radio 4 Extra) to Isaac Asimov's <i>I, Robot</i> and Ray Bradbury’s <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> (BBC Radio 4) to the acclaimed docudrama <i>The Space Race</i> (Audible Originals).</p>
<p>Since our childhood, we have loved Dan Dare. We grew up with him and watched as he evolved. The original was already in the British consciousness before we were born.</p>
<p>Our approach to this new audio incarnation has been to give the listener a modern Dan Dare in a classic form, adopting the fast-moving serialised format that echoes how the space hero was first brought to life for the radio by Radio Luxembourg, back in the 1950s. That format, as well as allowing for nail-biting cliffhangers, is also an epic and vibrant modern-day homage to the action heroes of 1930s adventure serials such as Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers– but with all the sophisticated production values, which have become our company’s hallmark.</p>
<p>Our Dan Dare is played for real (in its own 1950s terms), and exciting. It very much reflects how the original comic strips worked. After all, Frank Hampson created a world you could step into, not just a cartoon… Spaceship Away!</p>

<p>There are always risks and challenges when making any production, no less so when making audio drama. From actors suddenly becoming unavailable, to agents demanding a different colour spaceship for their star client.</p>
<p>However, the B7 Media team has extensive production experience across television, radio and film. We will deliver this production with the utmost skill and efficiency. </p>

<p>A few members of our crew are very busy, and so their availability may be an issue depending on timing. They've all very kindly agreed to do their best to fit this project in if they are busy on other projects, but if they are unavailable they will be replaced by another, equally skilled and talented industry professional. As such our cast and crew are correct at the time of publication, but may change.</p>
<p>We will do our best to avoid delays though, as is often the nature of working in this genre, battling with the Mekon can make some delays unavoidable.</p>
<p>WITH YOUR HELP, THE CONTINUING ADVENTURES OF DAN DARE WILL BE ASSURED – Spaceship Away!</p>

</div></div>","“For me, this audio revival of Dan Dare is a triumph. Each of the three episodes have the feel of an audio movie and it is easy to get pulled into their world. I cannot wait for the Anastasia to get back out there and explore this universe, and gladly give it square-jawed, generation gap busting 10/10.” - Ian McArdell, IndieMacUser

In 2017 icon of British science fiction, DAN DARE, dramatically returned to the airwaves over six all-new audio adventures featuring acclaimed performances from Ed Stoppard (Dan Dare), Geoff McGivern (Digby), Heida Reed (Professor Peabody), Michael Cochrane (Sir Hurbert) and Raad Rawi (The Mekon) along with many notable guest stars including Hugh Fraser, Noof McEwan, Bijan Daneshmand and Jonathan Rhodes.
Inspired by the original Eagle comic strip (1950-1967), B7 Media’s audio reboot of comic-book space hero DAN DARE was hailed by fans and critics alike - and the first season was also nominated for several radio awards. Most notably Vol 2 won the prestigious NYC International Radio Program Gold Award for ‘Best Digital Drama’ (2018).
We’re very proud of what we accomplished; the fulfilment of a 25-year old ambition of producer/director Andrew Mark Sewell. Over the last 18-months we've also been delighted to receive many, many requests for further adventures - which is why we've launched this crowdfunding campaign.
We want DAN DARE’s audio adventure to continue but we also need your support to fund production of a new, action-packed season of stories once again pitting Dan Dare and his crew against the Mekon - and other menaces, too!


""This is a slick, streamlined trilogy of stories that takes one of the all-time greats, puts him in a newly kitted out and streamlined world and lets him and his colleagues soar."" 
-  Sci-Fi Bulletin
“Feeling very much in the same cliffhanging style as pulp SF sagas like Flash Gordon, these are pacy, action-packed adventures that aren’t afraid to throw more modern concepts and references into Dare’s world.” - SFX Magazine
“It’s all very mysterious and intriguing, which are two of the things good science-fiction should be. The writers are taking the strengths of the original stories and shaping something new and exciting and that can only be a good thing. The best of the old and the best of the new, brought together seamlessly.” - DowntheTubes.net
""Ed Stoppard’s Dan Dare and Geoff McGivern’s Digby and their fractious relationship that evolves from one of cold distrust to mutual appreciation would have stolen the show if it wasn’t for Raad Rawi’s planet chewing turn as the narcissistic and megalomaniacal Mekon. Because, and much as we’re loathe to admit it, everyone loves a villain and Rawi’s Mekon is the epitome of self-serving, cold, logical evil. Welcome back Colonel Dare…"" - Mass Movement
“For me, this audio revival of Dan Dare is a triumph. Each of the three episodes have the feel of an audio movie and it is easy to get pulled into their world.

Our writers, cast and production team have more exciting Dan Dare stories to tell – the storylines have already been scripted for a new trilogy of stories (the first being ‘All Treens Must Die’.) 2020 makes the 70th anniversary of the ‘Pilot of the Future’ so releasing Vol 3, a new season of three exciting stories, would be a fitting tribute to complete the Dan Dare story arc we set in motion with Season 1.

Our initial plan is to fund and produce the first episode (see below) and release it digitally. If there's sufficient demand and interest, we will go onto crowdfund subsequent episodes and as the stakes increase, so will the perks!
Our ultimate goal is to fund the development, scripting, production and post-production of Vol Three in its entirety, boasting 3 x 75-minute adventures. The total budget for this is £45,000. Reaching further goals will allow us to commission scripts for Volume Four, commission more episodes and produce a special drama revealing the astonishing ‘true’ story behind the creation of Dan Dare by Frank Hampson and the Reverend Marcus Morris.
 

Each story is inspired by the original comic-strip first published in the Eagle Comic. 
The stories that make up Volume 3 will be;
ALL TREENS MUST DIE written by Colin Brake
Dan Dare has finally captured his arch-enemy and brought The Mekon to Earth to face trial for crimes against humanity. Despite Dare’s victory, however, these are troubled times on Earth. In the Reconstruction after the devastating invasion told in the first season adventure ""Reign of the Robots"", most menial tasks are now undertaken by refugee alien Treens. Many humans are hostile to and resentful of these aliens “taking their jobs”. Discontent is rumbling and, although defeated, the Mekon has a plan. When Treens loyal to the Mekon break him free, Dare and his team (Digby and Professor Peabody) are forced back into action to save not one world, but two as the Mekon’s twisted ideology of racial purity leads him to attack his own people, declaring, “All Treens Must Die...”
OPERATION DARK STAR written by Colin Brake
Dan Dare and Digby join Dare’s Uncle Ivor, on a mission to follow the route taken by Dare’s missing father, Frank Dare, in the ill-fated Orion Orbiter. Their destination - the Dark Star hidden near Pluto, which guards a stable Einstein-Rosen bridge: a wormhole through space/time. Meanwhile, Peabody, tasked by Sir Hubert of Space Fleet to investigate Eagle Corp, discovers evidence of secret off-the-books research being carried out by their old enemy, the mad scientist Blasco, using the Dark Star station as his base of operations. But before Peabody can warn Dare of the danger, Ivor – still struggling to find his own identity in the shadow of his famous brother – betrays his nephew to join Blasco’s cause. With all apparently lost, only Peabody can save Dare but she has her own, much more personal, crisis to deal with...
TERRA NOVA written by Colin Brake
Travelling through the time distortions of the Dark Star wormhole, Dare and his friends are joined by an unexpected stowaway - Cadet “Flamer” Spry. They reach Terra Nova (the alien planet Dare’s father found years ago) now the last planet holding out against the Vora’s apparently unstoppable advance across the known universe. It’s been completely ravaged by war and the Vora is about to launch a final assault. Learning that his father is being held a prisoner by the Vora, Dare attempts a rescue but ends up captured and thrown in a cell along with another prisoner: a defeated and despondent Mekon. Dare has to persuade his former enemy that together they can escape and defeat the Vora once and for all. But with the Vora’s mighty battle fleet already advancing towards the wormhole to attack Earth, will Dare and the Mekon’s desperate union succeed? Or will this prove to be Dan Dare’s final adventure?

We need to pay for the writers, actors, staff, studio hire, post-production, music, graphic designers, CD manufacture and of course Brian Williamson’s superb promotional artwork.
Each feature-length episode of Dan Dare costs approximately £14,500 to produce – that’s just over half the budget it would normally take to produce an equivalent one-hour audio drama for BBC Radio 4.
The bottom line is that we need your support to ensure Dan Dare’s return to the airwaves isn’t short lived and we get to celebrate his milestone 70th anniversary in style.
We’d love to conclude the trilogy of Dan Dare stories, bringing Dare’s conflict with his arch nemesis The Mekon to an exciting and shocking conclusion.
But your support is critical to making this happen!

Pledging money to this campaign is the only way you can access our rewards. Our initial rewards will get us going with Episode One, ""All Treens Must Die"", but we have plenty of big ideas for what we can add to our stretch goals and future plans!
For example, future stretch goal rewards may include posters of artwork, signed scripts from our back catalogue and the new series scripts, further downloads including music from the series, T-shirts, limited edition prints and more.
The campaign for ""All Treens Must Die""  currently includes:
Desktop artwork, a ""thank you"" credit on the Dan Dare webpage, outtakes from the episode's production, downloads of scripts from the previous volumes, a limited edition enamel pin of the Anastasia based on Brian Williamson's artwork and the chance for a character to carry your name!
And if we succeed in raising the money for Episode 1... It's onwards to Episodes 2 and 3 - and then we're really pushing the boat out!

On completion of the trilogy, an exclusive Limited Edition 70th Anniversary copy of the Dan Dare audio series in full. These limited edition packages will not be made available in shops or online stores so will be a ‘must have’ for any Dan Dare aficionado.
Tickets to our invitation-only cast and crew launch event in Soho, London.
Brian Williamson has drawn some stunning new artwork to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Dan Dare, which we’ll  print up as classic sized movie posters and if you asked nicely, he’ll even personally sign them!

Although any production can encounter logistical challenges and delays, we hope to fulfil all rewards by the end of the year (2020). With a release date already set for the Autumn 2020, we'll be working hard to ensure that you'll have your rewards in time for Christmas 2020.
If you have any questions about the rewards, additions, or changes, then please message us during the campaign. We're here and we're listening!


 
At B7 Media we’re known for our love of the science fiction genre and our particular brand of Audio Movies. We’ve dramatised for audio everything from the cult BBC sci-fi series Blake’s 7 (BBC Radio 4 Extra) to Isaac Asimov's I, Robot and Ray Bradbury’s The Martian Chronicles (BBC Radio 4) to the acclaimed docudrama The Space Race (Audible Originals).
Since our childhood, we have loved Dan Dare. We grew up with him and watched as he evolved. The original was already in the British consciousness before we were born.
Our approach to this new audio incarnation has been to give the listener a modern Dan Dare in a classic form, adopting the fast-moving serialised format that echoes how the space hero was first brought to life for the radio by Radio Luxembourg, back in the 1950s. That format, as well as allowing for nail-biting cliffhangers, is also an epic and vibrant modern-day homage to the action heroes of 1930s adventure serials such as Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers– but with all the sophisticated production values, which have become our company’s hallmark.
Our Dan Dare is played for real (in its own 1950s terms), and exciting. It very much reflects how the original comic strips worked. After all, Frank Hampson created a world you could step into, not just a cartoon… Spaceship Away!

<p>Hello! My name is Gavin Gaddis, and I miss Halloween. In a time of heatwaves and pineapple-flavored everything, let us cast our minds forward to much more <i>chilling </i>times.

Hello! My name is Gavin Gaddis, and I miss Halloween. In a time of heatwaves and pineapple-flavored everything, let us cast our minds forward to much more chilling times. I’ve been a podcast producer for two years now and want to take that experience to create a limited run fiction podcast that fully embraces the Halloween season, mixing scares and laughs along the way.  
A 4 minute trailer for The Ghost in 3B is now live on our podcast feed!
Why? I love Halloween dearly and The Ghost in 3B aims to be an atonement for past sins. A hefty work schedule in 2018 kept me so out of focus that by the time I was ready to watch some cheesy slasher flicks it was October 30th and I had nary a costume nor haunted house visit to show for it. Truly dark times. 
 This year, I plan to be ready. With a 75-ish page script, five frighteningly talented voice actors, and a heck of a lot of sound design I aim to deliver a horror podcast that gets the listener properly in the mood for Halloween.

Missing out on ‘Ween 2018 legitimately has haunted me and I’m raring to set things right this year. What We Need & What You Get
As is crowdfunding tradition I’ve broken everything down into a delicious pie chart to explore the costs that go into producing audio fiction.
As our pie friend demonstrates, the (spooky) lion’s share goes to supporting the amazing voice actors that will bring life to this story. Beyond that a little bit to cover the shipping costs of merch for the campaign and a modest Wordpress website to give the podcast a home.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge I foresee with this project is our hard deadline of the first week of October with a week of August entirely shot while I’m covering Podcast Movement in Orlando. That said, I feel we have a comfortable amount of run-up time in September to get the series polished and ready for distribution.  The feed for the show exists, I already have the workflow for fiction podcasting set up due to Standard Docking Procedure, and casting has already been taken care of. The main hurdle is finishing up the scripts and paying voice actors. From then on it’s editing and sound design work straight to the finish line.
That said the biggest risk, of course, getting too spooked.

The aim is to expose those aspects of life in my country that aren't talked about often, or that are at risk of being forgotten. Initially, “Being VI” was a 50 minute documentary I’ve been planning since 2015. I decided to switch to the vlog format because:</p><ul>
<li>I didn’t want to rush into a big project. This vlog will basically be weekly 10-minute long documentaries, giving me the opportunity to refine my craft through practice.</li>
<li>Producing a feature-length documentary is expensive. Producing a vlog is a lot cheaper.</li>

Help me share ""Natures Little Secret"" with the world!</p></div>","A Little About MeMy name is Earl Hazel Jr. I am a 27 year old Freelance Videographer born and raised in the British Virgin Islands.  I have always had a passion for the arts, and a deep love for cinematography. I am also a history geek and a sucker for a good story. Growing up in my closely knit community, I have been entertained by, eavesdropped on and even experienced for myself the history, culture and wonders of my island home. I want to share these stories with the world.“Being VI” Docu-Vlog""Being VI"" is a documentary-styled vlog consisting of 10-15 minute episodes released weekly on YouTube. Viewers can follow me as I seek to discover and share the experience, memories, tales and adventures of the locals and visitors of the Virgin Islands. The aim is to expose those aspects of life in my country that aren't talked about often, or that are at risk of being forgotten. Initially, “Being VI” was a 50 minute documentary I’ve been planning since 2015. I decided to switch to the vlog format because:
I didn’t want to rush into a big project. This vlog will basically be weekly 10-minute long documentaries, giving me the opportunity to refine my craft through practice.
Producing a feature-length documentary is expensive. Producing a vlog is a lot cheaper.
I can expound on stories of interest and focus on current events if “Being VI” was episodic (as opposed to being a 50 minute film).
I refuse to let another year end without it becoming reality. Adapt and conquer!
 My Fundraising GoalThe goal of this campaign is to raise US $3500 to assist with obtaining equipment needed for the production of the docu-vlog. I have several goal tiers:Q: What happens if I don’t raise all of the funds?A: This Campaign has a Flexible Goal, meaning that I get to keep the money raised even if it doesn’t reach it’s goal.

<p>Fans of the Bloodybits Horror Show know I take my horror movies seriously. That is why I am often brought on as a guest expert on the Grindbin podcast when they are covering a film in this genre.

<p>Well on 8/26/202 I was browsing Ebay, looking for inspiration to dig me out of my morally and creatively bankrupt hole I have been living in ever since, when something caught my eye.

I searched it up, and Lo and behold i'd stumbled upon the TRUE sequel to Slumber Party Massacre.  It even includes Brinke Stevens reprising her role as Linda Dawn Grant, and is produced by Roger Corman and lensed by Jim Wynorski.

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this fundraiser is to ask for assistance in helping us raise the rest of the funds needed to make this happen, legally and licensed. We are not looking to be limited in any way, form or fashion. With your help, this will allow us to launch on schedule and bring value to the industry once again.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are over a million music artists in the United States alone going after a mere chance of being heard and or seen. Though we know it is unrealistic to say this will be home to all, but it can be to some. The level of confidence that comes to one from just hearing that first Yes can be the spark needed for the next Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Beatles, etc.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is just to help us launch. We are well aware that marketing and promotion is going to take a lot more than what we are asking for and we are more than ready to put in the work. It has to start somewhere though and that's all we are asking for.  </p>
<p>The biggest factors to help separate our station from anyone else's will be the overall mission and the classes. If it was just to play music, we can do that on several platforms, but for a brand new artist to have a place to not only test his/her content but be able to hone and mold it is something no other station is providing right now which is where the true value of radio comes in at.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We have additional ways you can assist us as well besides monetarily.</p>
<p>- You can share this with your music friends and entertainers on social media and local press. Let them see what is coming for them.</p>
<p>- We never pretend to know it all so if you have any advice, guidance and or skills that you would like to share, feel free to contact us.</p>

1212DIGITAL, Inc. is a New York-based company that provides digital media platforms for aspiring and upcoming artists and entertainers. We are looking to now provide a new platform, where these artists and entertainers will have direct access to getting additional airplay without having to jump through hoops or pay for any irrelevant ""promotional packages"" just to have their song played.
At our radio station, artists and entertainers will be able to develop their mic and interview skills from our weekly classes, fans will be able to discover new talent and content from our daily playlists and shows and we will get to do what we do best and provide entertainment.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our goal is to host the long-awaited debate between Steven Crowder and Sam Seder that nearly occurred on June 21st, 2021 by raising the necessary funds for Steven Crowder's honorarium:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We have already reached out to Steven Crowder's agent online. </p>
<p>IF THIS DEBATE DOES NOT HAPPEN FOR ANY REASON, EVERYONE GETS 100% OF THEIR CONTRIBUTION BACK. ZERO RISK.</p>
<p>We've successfully hit our goal for all of our past crowdfunds (one here on IGG and one on Kickstarter) for debates. I (James) have set up and hosted/moderated over 600 debates, mostly online, though several were in person (a handful in Texas, one in Los Angeles, one in Wisconsin).</p>
<p>We started Modern-Day Debate 2.5 years ago because we wanted to ensure that people from all walks of life had a fully-neutral and fair platform they could make their case on, or hear other people make their case on!</p>
<p>We host debates on science, religion, and politics, because we believe debate has the potential to change cultures for the better by getting people with different perspectives to communicate, and to show that people can disagree and still be friends.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are fundraising to cover Steven Crowder's necessary honorarium and the remaining funds ($14,300) beyond that amount are to cover the taxes I (James) would have to pay on the total. We plan on launching a stretch goal for Sam Seder's honorarium as well. I (James) will not be taking any cut of the funds.</li>
<li>Perks are being decided (open to suggestions, but we prefer to not add monetary perks [e.g., merchandise] so that we can keep the total crowdfund goal as low as possible.</li>

The story follows the relationship between Emma, a 26 year old burn out, and her Artificially Intelligent therapist, Gus. Emma encounters a not so distant future where her online data is used to customize her medical treatment. As we step into the 2020s, the data we create will mean everything in our hyper fragmented and highly customized market. This narrative allows us to peak into a future where a high value for commercial progress outranks the privacy and mental health of consumers.  </p><h3>Budget</h3><p>$700 festival entry fees</p><p>$700 festival travel accommodations</p><p>$300 VR hardware and software</p><h3>Benefits </h3><p>Funding would help us get a lot of crazy cool things done. While most of the funding goes to festival submission and travel accommodations, part of our funding is for hardware that would allow us to bring this story into a new dimension. If funding allows, the Ouroboros team would be able to produce an interactive version of the in-story counseling program, Ananta. Using Muse Neurosensing technology and Oculos GO VR, audiences would be able to engage with an interactive guided meditation that reacts in real time to their brainwaves/mental states.

As my YouTube channel only generates about $100 a month. I plan on doing all the work myself besides the electrical and data cabling. That needs professional hands. This is an all or nothing campaign, if I don't meet the goal I will end the crowdfunding and issue a refund. Please help me grow.

<p>Herkese Merhaba,</p>
<p>Türkiye’nin en büyük podcast ağı olma misyonu ile çıktığımız yolda yaklaşık sekiz ayı geride bıraktık. Yola çıkarken tek ve çok önemli bir amacımız vardı. O da program yapmak isteyen içerik sağlayıcılara geniş bir ifade özgürlüğü sunmak. Geride kalan dönemde 25 program ile 250 bölüm podcasti sizlerle buluşturmaya çalıştık. Sürekli genişleyen ağımız bu süreçte 40 bine yakın dinlenme ve 25 bin civarında indirilme sayısına erişti. İyi bir teknik altyapı sunmak adına her gün araştırmalar yaptığımız bu süreçte, Patreon’da sizlerin de katkısı ile sürekli sistemlerimizi geliştirmeye çalıştık ve size en iyiyi vermeye çalıştık. Kullanıcıların da sürece dahil olması ile birlikte bugüne kadar hedeflediklerimizi büyük oranda yerine getirebildik ve Medyapod’u ayakta tutmayı başardık.</p>
<p>Ancak artık daha fazlasını istiyor ve medyada alanın daraldığı, ana akımda artan tek sesliliğe karşı gerçeklere ve toplumun tüm kesimlerine renk verme misyonumuzu daha da güçlü sürdürmek istiyoruz. İfade özgürlüğünü daha geniş bir kitleye eriştirmeyi amaçlıyoruz. Sadece Türkiye’de değil, tüm dünyada dinlenebilir birçok dilde içerikler üretmeyi hedefliyoruz. Medyapod’u siyasetten spora, teknolojiden müziğe dolu dolu içeriklerle çok daha büyük bir podcast ağı yapmayı planlıyoruz.</p>
<p>İşte bu yüzden bugün size her zamankinden çok daha fazla ihtiyacımız var. Kampanyamıza sağlayacağınız tek seferlik destek ile, artan program sayımız sonucu bununla paralel olarak ağırlaşan iş yükümüzü azaltmak üzere, bir editörümüzü tam zamanlı istihdam etmemize katkı sunacaksınız. Sizin bağışınızla maaş alacak bu editör, programların sosyal medya ve tüm mecralarda paylaşımı, bu alanda hazırlanan görseller ve yoğun iş dinamiğinde büyümemize ve varlığımızı sürdürmemize büyük katkı sağlayacak. İşte bu yüzden bir editörü bir yıl boyunca istihdam edecek bir destek kampanyası başlatıyoruz. Bütün bu süreçte her zaman söz taahhüt ettiğimiz gibi, yine şeffaflık ve ifade özgürlüğünü daima ön planda tutacağız.</p>
<p>Medyapod için siz de katkı verin. Gelin, ifade özgürlüğünü, çok sesliliği, Türkiye’nin en büyük podcast ağında hep birlikte yaşatalım.</p>

<h3>Como tudo começou? E o que pretendemos com esta campanha?</h3>
<p>O All Things Apple começou em agosto de 2017 com a criação do perfil Instagram “Notícias Apple”. Tal como o nome indica, este era um perfil Instagram que fazia chegar aos utilizadores as últimas notícias Apple de forma rápida e apelativa aos seguidores. </p>
<p>O Instagram não é uma plataforma fácil de gerir nem tão pouco de conseguir seguidores. Mas o All Things Apple conseguiu conquistar o público através do seu formato inovador! Uma imagem apelativa acompanhada de uma descrição concisa. Assim redefiníamos a forma de dar a notícia.</p>
<p>Com toda a força dos nossos seguidores, decidimos dar o salto para a criação de uma plataforma completa, composta por podcasts, YouTube, e website. Desde a criação da plataforma, o All Things Apple cresceu de uma forma inacreditável. Conseguiu não só tornar-se líder do mercado a nível nacional como tornar-se numa referência a nível internacional ao ser nomeado para os Apple Awards - um prémio internacional atribuído aos melhores produtos Apple do ano bem como os melhores projetos (blogs, instagrammers e youtubers).</p>
<p>1 ano e 3 meses depois da sua fundação, o All Things Apple conta com cerca de 20 colaboradores, distribuídos por Portugal e Brasil. Um projeto liderado por jovens, com muita garra e vontade de fazer cada vez mais e melhor para a comunidade Apple de ambos os países.</p>
<p>E é por isso que surge a ideia deste crowdfunding. Precisamos do vosso apoio como há um ano atrás para criar todo este “império”! Queremos fazer-vos chegar mais e melhor conteúdo! Queremos soltar as amarras e voar bem alto!</p>
<p>Faz a tua contribuição no All Things Apple! Ajuda-nos a investir no YouTube, nos Podcasts, no desenvolvimento do site e de uma nova app! E isto é apenas uma pequena lista do pretendemos fazer... Ajuda-nos a crescer e não te vais desiludir!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Creep is a brand new podcast, from writer Mel Hartman, who was also the writer of the 'Definitely Not Haunted' podcast, Disenchanted. This time around, instead of voicing the main character, they're looking to work behind the scenes and hand the voice work over to the awesomely talented voice actors out there, and good lord are there a lot of you!</p>
<p>Creep is about a detective that gets a case from an unlikely source, a case concerning a heist of a famous painting. Denver and Miami, former partners and still friends, team up with the help of the client, Sasha, to make sure nothing happens to the painting. However, Miami gets a bit more than he bargained for with a heist of a different kind. Can Denver save the day? You'll have to tune in to find out!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Actors</strong>: Combined for both seasons, the actors will be paid $10 per episode, and with 3 main actors and a few smaller cameos for each season, we're looking at almost exactly $600.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sound Design</strong>: While Mel is looking to do most of the sound design themselves, they would also like to bring in a more seasoned person to give advice where and when needed. At about 10 minutes of audio per episode, we're looking to pay them $1 per minute, so roughly $10 per episode. With 6 episodes per season, that's $120. </li>
<li>
<strong>Art and Music</strong>: We're looking for most of our music on free-as-long-as-you-credit sources, or simple one time purchases for the license (such as Pond5) so we're not too worried about that, but we'd love to have enough money to commission and artist or 2, as well as the money to order the stickers we're going to have as rewards, so we're hoping for about $200 in the art department.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This all totals around $920, which doesn't include Mel paying themselves anything. If you'd like to see Mel being paid as well, at $10 an episode which is what they're paying everyone else, we're looking at $1040 (but that'll be a stretch goal.) </strong></p>
<p><strong><u>We're placing our goal at $1000 to account for the fees and taxes that are taken out.</u></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We understand that Covid-19 is a thing right now, and it's affected many people's livelihoods and jobs. Because of that, we totally understand that donating may not be a thing you're able to do right now, and we completely understand.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use twitter, facebook, etc, to get the word out about our campaign! Share it to all of your friends!</li>
<li>Follow us on twitter at @CreepPodcast and don't forget to yell about how much you love the show to us once it's out! And you're more than welcome to review us on Podchaser and other podcast platforms as well when the time comes.</li>

Everyone will experience a power outage and it's a terrible inconvenience. You can't cook, charge your phones, tablets, and computers. Or even worse, your family's lives could be at risk when you're unable to power critical medical devices.You can't predict the unpredictable, but you can prepare for it. It's time to take charge and make a change. That is why Bluetti is here. Introducing the EP500 Series Power Station.【It can save you money and protect the environment】Can it only be used during power outages? Of course not!By adding roof solar panels or portable solar panels, you can help offset part of your home's power usage. Not only can you save your electricity bills, but you can feel great about making a contribution to the environment by harnessing clean and free solar energy.The BLUETTI EP500/Pro features 5,100Wh of LiFePO4 battery storage, 2,000W (or 3,000W) pure sine wave inverter, capable of providing all the power you need to keep your most essential and critical electronics running. Furthermore, it features Split Phase Bonding, seamless 24/7 UPS backup protection from power outages, plug-and-play usability, App remote control and a 6,000+ charge cycle. Offering you peace of mind and control when your neighbors may find themselves panicking without food and power.  There are so many energy storage devices on the market, such as fuel generators, lead-acid battery generators, as well as lithium batteries. Why should you choose us? Scroll down and we'll explain why!【Compared to Lead-acid Batteries】We offer a wide range of lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries, which are the safest lithium battery type currently available on the market. Each battery has been specifically engineered to deliver high life cycles and excellent performance over a wide operating environment and temperature.【Compared to Fuel-Based Generators】A smarter alternative to traditional generators, the EP500 is fume-free and quiet. With no harmful emissions, our battery-powered generators reduce your carbon footprint and enable flexible indoor/outdoor operations.【Compared to Power Stations】Typical backup power stations currently on the market can only handle low-power equipment, have long recharge times, and support very few functions.Regarding the safety, function, and price that customers care about most, it’s not hard to see the benefits. EP500 Pro Series will be your trusted life companion.    Designed as a flexible power station to meet various scenarios, the EP500 Series has different usages.【Movable Power Station】Because it’s meant to be portable and mobile, not something stuck to your wall or garage. The EP500 Series is a ""no Installation needed"" plug-and-play product that can easily be moved to the desired location when needed.【In-grid UPS Mode】Installing the BLUETTI UPS Box (Sub Panel) by a qualified licensed electrician will be able to wire in a dedicated circuit to connect your EP500 or EP500 Pro to the building’s main switchboard. Power everything from lights in high-use rooms and fridges to medical devices, internet modems, and more. 【Flexible UPS Mode】In case of an outage, the UPS feature comes in handy. When EP500 Series detects a power failure, it automatically kicks into gear, which allows a computer or any of the most sensitive utilities that you can't afford to lose to keep running.【Off-grid Energy Storage】Take your BLUETTI EP500 Series completely off-grid by pairing it with your roof solar panels.  Multiple Devices Can Be Loaded SimultaneouslyTraditional lithium batteries can only carry very few devices. Your BLUETTI EP500 Series are completely different. With 2000 (or 3000W) output, the EP500 Series can load devices simultaneously. Isn’t it spectacular!Power outages can happen to anyone, anytime, and they can last days. Small portable batteries are mostly pointless during such times, as they don’t support high-powered appliances, nor will they last very long. To ensure you have power for days, you must have a large capacity battery, such as EP500 Series which is engineered with a 5100Wh large battery capacity. Flexible Recharging Way To Keep Your EP500 Always OnEP500 Series can be powered by a variety of power sources, including AC charging, solar panels, and so on. This way, you can access the most convenient power sources when you need.【From The Wall】Throw away the big bricks, just using the included AC charging cable to recharge this battery pack through the AC input port. For EP500Pro, the charging speed depends on the ampere and voltage of the wall socket.【From The Sun】Use the earth’s best natural resource to top up! With a solar input and MPPT control up to 2400W (1200W for EP500), the EP500 Pro can be fully charged fast and safely in 2.6hrs and 4.75hrs for EP500.MPPT stands for ""Maximum Power Point Tracker,"" and a unit comes pre-installed on the EP500 Series. You'll get up to 40% faster charging than a standard charging port, and you'll see your most significant efficiency gains when solar charging.【AC + Solar charging & Dual AC Charging】Still want faster charging? No problem, we’ve got you covered. This class-leading unit can be recharged by using the AC + PV input port simultaneously.- Recharge via solar and AC power simultaneously, you’ll get a maximum of 4000W input power.- Recharge via dual AC power simultaneously (One AC charging cable and one BLUETTI T500 AC adapter). Multiple Charging Outputs Provides More Options​Single application energy storage systems, such as a Tesla Powerwall, are a thing of the past. The EP500 offers a wide range of powering options with seven versatile ports, including four industry-leading 2000W AC ports to run anything you could from a wall outlet. Power RV’s, trailers, off-grid events, worksites, essential circuits in your home, and more you might need to charge.Split Phase Bonding FunctionAs an emergency energy storage power for the whole family, Bluetti has a pretty cool option to double the AC output and storage capacity. For higher power loads, Bluetti is releasing its own “BLEUTTI Split Phase Box.” Users can connect two EP500s in tandem to double the rated 4000-watt power output and double storage capacity with this accessory board. The Split Phase Box will also offer 220/240-volt output options to power 220-volt appliances. The high power output means you can now run your home air conditioner, clothes dryer, in-wall Electric Heater, Mining machine and other high power appliances with ease. No need to worry about power outages on hot summer nights or cold, bitter winters anymore.Moreover, it can also be connected to the home grid in the Split Phase Bonding state. Peak load ShiftingThe EP500 Series can reduce your electricity bill by helping you manage your power efficiently. For example, you can charge the battery during off-peak hours, when electricity prices are lower. Then during peak hours, use the EP500 Series for your power needs. When connected to a private power station like a photovoltaic system, you can build a 24/7 operable private power network. Control Power In The Palm Of Your Fingers【App Control】Monitor, control, and optimize your power usage from anywhere with the BLUETTI app, which offers remote control of power in/out, real-time power consumption notifications, and charging profiles to maximize your battery life. Moreover, you can enjoy the latest firmware update over Wi-Fi directly.
【Smart Touchscreen】Most of the power stations didn't pay enough attention to the Human Machine Interface. EP500 Series comes with a smart touchscreen that simplifies the workflow of your daily projects, letting you manage the most-used tasks directly from the touchscreen.
  In developing the EP500 Series, we prioritized product safety above all else, backed by multiple layers of protection. Regardless of circuit design, software programming, material selection, production process, testing and packaging, we have taken every precaution to ensure the product is safe under all conditions.【Strict In Each Step】We feel the most significant driver behind our continued growth is our focus on providing the highest quality products, coupled with the best service in our industry.Our strict quality requirements mean that suppliers must meet numerous preconditions before cooperation. All our manufacturers undergo comprehensive auditing to determine whether they live up to our high standards and requirements.Every BLUETTI product we built is a premium-quality product produced with the finest materials and to the highest standards. It’s a product you will be proud to own. Before shipping, all products undergo strict quality assurance tests with a focus on product construction and performance.【 Remarkably Technology】Modern times require modern technology. Thanks to the unique BLUETTI technology, the EP500 Series is far more powerful than you think.  With a high-efficiency monocrystalline solar cell, you will get greater power efficiency even though the panel is smaller than a traditional model.

<p>The Firewalla team is made up of former Cisco engineers with a desire to use our experience in networking and cybersecurity to secure the world’s internet. We believe powerful cybersecurity options should be accessible, affordable, and easy to use. We are a small team, with a shared passion for architecture, design, and keeping our customers happy.</p>
<p>This is our fourth crowdfunding. We have delivered thousands of units in the three previous campaigns, on time and early. We truly enjoy the journey of working with great customers like you, so we are here again! Together, we secure the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since the world is recovering from the pandemic, there will be unknown risks with any hardware projects at the moment. Our team delivered the Firewalla Gold on time during the pandemic lockdown, so we do have good experience navigating the unknown. In case anything unusual comes up, we will make sure it is fully transparent and you know exactly what we are doing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>1. Firewalla Purple comes with a default power adapter with a USA plug. For customers outside of the USA, we are offering an international power adapter converter as an add-on during checkout. The power adapter used is Type C (&gt;=3A) based, very likely you already have a few stashed somewhere.</p>
<p>2. If you are located outside of the United States, Firewalla Inc is not responsible for import duties or taxes, and processing fees from shipping providers.</p>

<h3><strong>What is the future of Human Memory or what do we do with Neuralink?</strong></h3>
<p>As memory-related personal data is digitized, safekeeping user identity and data is an increasing priority.</p>
<p>‍‍With the anticipated brain-machine interfaces (i.e. Neuralink’s app store), memoryOS will become a unique neura-software provider of storage space for the most personal information in a secure environment.</p>
<p>Our technology’s unique future advantages on Neuralink’s app store platform:</p>
<p>For people with Neuralink brain implant – Neuralink can be used to almost instantly download our digital Mind Palace itself in its empty form along with our mnemonic skill package. People will have the option to encode, store, and decode most personal information in the brain’s natural biological* format without the need to use Neuralink’s digital storage.</p>
<p>For people without Neuralink – with the help of memoryOS through existing platforms, the ability to memorize any needed information in large amounts and stay competitive without the need to implant the microchip. Leaving out the sacrifice of human liberties and denying the possible risk of personal memories getting stolen and other repercussions.</p>
<p>*The unique advantage of using our mind palace storage is that only the palace itself is digital before it's copy is transferred into users' imagination. The memorized information itself is not digital due to the mnemonic link, which happens in the human brain’s imagination and is rather a biological process. If a person with the digital brain implant will have no choice to store memories in the natural biological format without giving Neuralink full access to it, it is the point where humans lose all liberty, and the identity is taken over where false memories will determine the behavior of a controlled human.</p>

EFFECTIVENESS AND RESULTS
 
Prior to сrowdfunding, we had 33 thousand people in our Early Adopters community. For those that have tried the memoryOS demo, the average improvement in recall increased by 70% with an average increase in recall speed by 60% just after one relatively short demo session.
 

 
 
 
memoryOS IN ACTION
 
Learning should be fun! We understand that, so we created a unique and fun way for you to improve your memory fast and with confidence!
We have combined proven memory techniques with the latest advances in e-learning and an immersive 3D game to create the most enjoyable and effective tool for learning memorization skills and keeping your brain alive.

  Gamified micro-learning and learning by doingWith memoryOS, you improve your mental performance in an enjoyable way that doesn’t trigger resistance from your brain or from your old habits and lets you gradually harness your amazingly powerful mind!  PRE-MADE VIRTUAL MIND PALACES  Memorization skill entails having a structured storage space (i.e., Mind Palace) for the information you need to remember. Mind or a Memory Palace is a fundamental memory technique used by all World Memory Champions.  Mind Palace consists of Loci - unique objects which serve as folders to encode, store and retrieve a set of specific information. In the mind palace technique (i.e., method of loci), well-known environments are composed of many unique Loci.To encode information onto Loci, you have to come up with solid associations between information and Loci. Then, to retrieve the information, you ""walk"" through the Mind Palace in your imagination, which brings to life created associations and triggers an instant recall.   BENEFITS   MEET CO-FOUNDER OF memoryOS - THE 2X WORLD MEMORY CHAMPION Over the last few years, our dev team has been working closely with the two times World Memory Champion - Jonas von Essen, to create joyful and interactive microlessons and empower everyone to achieve their best.  
As somebody who went from struggling to remember simple things to becoming the World Memory Champion twice, our startup's co-founder Jonas von Essen knows all the common false beliefs and myths about “having a bad memory.”
He has taken part in commercials in Australia, Chinese TV shows, British documentaries, helped Charles Darwin University create a memory course, and was hired to train national memory teams. Featured in BBC, The New York Times, Independent, The Telegraph, The Times, and on various other news & blog sites. 
In 2018 Jonas had a breakthrough in Sweden through his remarkable accomplishments in Sweden’s Got Talent, where he started by memorizing the names of all the 500 people in the audience in his audition, got a golden buzzer, and then memorized the first 50,000 decimals of Pi for the spectacular finals. 

 
 
PERKS All plans provide you with initial Loci (storage space in the Mind Palace), and each plan has a limit to it. With time, users may want to increase the Loci quantity without upgrading the plan. Scholar and Essentials plans allow you to add (i.e., buy) a limited number of additional loci within each plan's limit. Expert plan has no cap limit to add (i.e., buy) extra Loci.Loci add-ons are permanent and will not require additional monthly payments.  PLAN COMPARISON PREMIUM REWARDS   PERKS DISTRIBUTION TIMELINE  AI-POWERED eLEARNING COMPONENT AI-generated content with most advanced OpenAI's GPT-3 We are excited to begin the hugely exclusive process to implement OpenAI’s GPT-3 and DALL·E into our EdTech app to leverage by creating high-value content for lessons, exercises, and practical use. Becoming more than just an app.DALL·E is a 12-billion parameter version of GPT-3 trained to generate images from text descriptions, using a dataset of text-image pairs. Combinations of both real and/or imaginary things significantly speed up the association in visual creation - to memorize with ease any needed information using the Method of Loci technique.Generated image interactions. AI converts words into somewhat bizarre images, making the brain have a high interest in new and unusual forms.   CHANGE IN RECALL TEST METHOD Participants heard and saw different sets of 15 random words, which appeared one-after-another, for 10 seconds each. Then following a short 3-minute break, they were required to recall and type in these words in the exact order heard. We have performed this testing of users' memory skills before and after the demo experience.     Medical conditions and resultsA small group of users with such medical conditions as ADHD, anxiety, and various disorders that affect attention showed results that even slightly outperformed our demo users' overall average increase in recall results. And showed approximately the same results in a speed increase.Of course, it is yet to be more research conducted on this topic with large groups of people on the scientific level. For now, we may conclude that memoryOS can benefit your memory even while you have certain conditions that sometimes make memorization hard. As several individual examples have shown - even with brain damage or aphasia it's possible to see an improvement in recall.Of course, we invite you to try our demo beforehand if you want to feel it out for yourself. Prior gaming experienceBased on our data we have found that prior gaming/mobile-gaming experience or its lack doesn't affect the level of memory improvement. Our game mechanics are simple and most users have no problem using the app.  STRETCH GOALSGoals are unlocked upon reaching a specific funding level. This mutual effort increases the value of the product for everyone. memoryOS will have more features with each goal reached. CATEGORY DESCRIPTION   ADD-ONS Don't forget to add these extra options upon checkout!When purchased with Family Plan, each add-on is applied to all individual accounts for the price of one. MEET THE TEAM    WE INVITE YOU TO JOIN OUR MISSION memoryOS has been initiated on the pure enthusiasm of its creators and desire to bear positive changes into the world. We are very fortunate for all the sincere help and support we have received from our friends, family, and great people out there on our mission to enable spectacular memory in every human brain.  Everything began from our co-founder's personal pain when he realized how unnecessarily stressful his life was during the test and exam periods at school and university. Even though having a Mind Palace boosted his grades as well as free time, Alex saw that existing methods of obtaining memorization skills have significant limitations that stop almost everyone from acquiring it as a lifelong skill. Continuing to feel the unnecessary pain of scholars, students, and people in general, he decided to find a solution and build a team to implement it.Let's #MakeTheWorldRemember#OurMindsAreLimitless  VIDEO TESTIMONIALS - RAW FOOTAGE Steve - California, USA""Memory loss runs in my family, and it’s something I've been worried about as I get older.

JOURNEY TO THE MIND PALACE 
 
BONUS SHORT FILM

 
***
What is the future of Human Memory or what do we do with Neuralink?
As memory-related personal data is digitized, safekeeping user identity and data is an increasing priority.
‍‍With the anticipated brain-machine interfaces (i.e. Neuralink’s app store), memoryOS will become a unique neura-software provider of storage space for the most personal information in a secure environment.
Our technology’s unique future advantages on Neuralink’s app store platform:
For people with Neuralink brain implant – Neuralink can be used to almost instantly download our digital Mind Palace itself in its empty form along with our mnemonic skill package. People will have the option to encode, store, and decode most personal information in the brain’s natural biological* format without the need to use Neuralink’s digital storage.
For people without Neuralink – with the help of memoryOS through existing platforms, the ability to memorize any needed information in large amounts and stay competitive without the need to implant the microchip. Leaving out the sacrifice of human liberties and denying the possible risk of personal memories getting stolen and other repercussions.
*The unique advantage of using our mind palace storage is that only the palace itself is digital before it's copy is transferred into users' imagination. The memorized information itself is not digital due to the mnemonic link, which happens in the human brain’s imagination and is rather a biological process. If a person with the digital brain implant will have no choice to store memories in the natural biological format without giving Neuralink full access to it, it is the point where humans lose all liberty, and the identity is taken over where false memories will determine the behavior of a controlled human.

<li>To improve the material durability, we applied the CNT (carbon nanotube) material after conducting extensive R&amp;D.</li>
<li>We learned that glass is another important component that determines the performance of a wiper, besides the wiper, and all kinds of external contamination and usage of the wrong glass cleaning agent can reduce the performance and life of a wiper. We have developed a cleaner and treatment for windshield jointly with the national research institute. This windshield cleaning agent helps maintain consistent glass surface conditions for longer use and smoother operation of a wiper.</li>

<p>We have applied customized materials in two parts – one is where smooth movement is needed, and another is where it is in direct contact with the water-repellent coated glass. <br/>Wiper blades have a complex structure with each component serving its own function. The upper part of the wiper blade is made of flexible and durable material that securely holds the wiper blade and allows it to be used for a long time without tearing. KIMBLADE’s core technology, CNT-reinforced special silicone, is used at the tip of the blade, which touches the glass directly and wipes rain and water off the glass.

CNT is the next-generation material that has a tube-shaped atomic arrangement and has high strength, as well as thermal and electrical conductivity. Like reinforcing bars in concrete, CNT can be added to silicone as a reinforcing material to make CNT-silicon a composite material. This composite material was used to make the wiper blade so as to improve durability and increase mechanical strength while maintaining elasticity. Typical wiper blades are generally made of a single material, they do not have the ability to be strong and flexible at the same time. However, KIMBLADE uses different materials for different parts. Compared to the upper part that requires mechanical properties, the lower part requires smooth movement over glass and water repellency. By applying different materials, KIMBLADE is able to have excellent mechanical properties and functions as a special purpose wiper.</p>

Thus, we conducted extensive research and tests to come up with a solution.<br/><u><strong>Here are some of our findings that you might not have been aware of.</strong></u><br/>Problems like vibration, noise, or blurring that are considered as problems of the wiper, are greatly affected by the condition of the windshield. Whether or not you regularly maintain and care for your windshield and the kind of cleaning agent used can affect a wiper’s lifespan. To this end, we have conducted a thorough R&amp;D and came up with a cleaning solution made specifically for windshields. We greatly appreciate all the feedback from the Backers.</p>

<p>Windshields are different from other glasses because they protect the drivers from automobile exhaust gases, fine dust generated during driving, engine oil dropped on the ground, insects, etc. Most people clean their windshield as if they would clean glass with a regular glass cleaner. This may seem okay at first, but the unremoved contaminants adsorbed in the glass can obstruct the view on rainy days and interfere with the wiper operation. Also, waxes or coatings applied to windshields can present serious problems with the wiper operation.</p>

<p>Unlike other glass surfaces of automobiles, a windshield is a surface that protects the driver from various contaminants and is in contact with the rubber part of the wiper. The smooth operation of the wiper depends on its compatibility with the coating agent applied to the glass surface. A typically used glass coating agent is not generally compatible with the wiper, and it may lower a wiper’s performance and create noise. You may end up in an unfavorable situation if the wiper does not work when it ought to.</p>

 No need to get a water-repellent coating for your windshield anymore! KIMBLADE wipers act as the water-repellent coating.

To improve the material durability, we applied the CNT (carbon nanotube) material after conducting extensive R&D.
We learned that glass is another important component that determines the performance of a wiper, besides the wiper, and all kinds of external contamination and usage of the wrong glass cleaning agent can reduce the performance and life of a wiper. We have developed a cleaner and treatment for windshield jointly with the national research institute. This windshield cleaning agent helps maintain consistent glass surface conditions for longer use and smoother operation of a wiper.
To address the issue of incorrect size and delivery problem, we have established a wiper finder which helps customers to identify what wipers they need. By signing a contract with FedEx, we are now able to ensure safe and fast delivery anywhere in the world.

 

Products will be shipped to the backers all at once within one month after funding is finished. Shipping will be completed within 3 to 5 days when Fedex takes the package from KIMBLADE.
 

 
 



We use a Rectangular blade (4-bar linkage structure) that produces a smooth and spotless window surface.
 


 


 

 


 
 There are various merits if a car wiper blade is made out of silicon materials. One thing for sure is that you can check soft movement and the other one is that water repellent coating can be constantly applied onto the glass.Highly stable and strong special silicone prevents deformation and corrosion even when exposed to outdoor conditions for a long time.
 


We have applied customized materials in two parts – one is where smooth movement is needed, and another is where it is in direct contact with the water-repellent coated glass. Wiper blades have a complex structure with each component serving its own function. The upper part of the wiper blade is made of flexible and durable material that securely holds the wiper blade and allows it to be used for a long time without tearing. KIMBLADE’s core technology, CNT-reinforced special silicone, is used at the tip of the blade, which touches the glass directly and wipes rain and water off the glass. The specially reinforced silicone minimizes tearing from foreign substances, works smoothly on the glass, and forms a coating film on the glass surface.
 

Silicone is considered safe for use in high-temperature applications, so it can withstand high fluctuations in temperature when rubber cannot. 
 
  The existing rubber wiper is relatively vulnerable to strong sunlight, freezing weather, ultraviolet rays, and ozone, resulting in an increase of deformation and corrosion as time goes by. KIMBLADE wiper is made out of special double-layered silicon and is very stable regarding deformation and corrosion even when exposed to various environmental circumstances, enabling a user to experience reliability and convenience.
 
 

 Carbon takes on many different forms (diamond, charcoal, pencil lead, graphene, etc.), depending on the atomic arrangement. CNT is the next-generation material that has a tube-shaped atomic arrangement and has high strength, as well as thermal and electrical conductivity. Like reinforcing bars in concrete, CNT can be added to silicone as a reinforcing material to make CNT-silicon a composite material. This composite material was used to make the wiper blade so as to improve durability and increase mechanical strength while maintaining elasticity. Typical wiper blades are generally made of a single material, they do not have the ability to be strong and flexible at the same time. However, KIMBLADE uses different materials for different parts. Compared to the upper part that requires mechanical properties, the lower part requires smooth movement over glass and water repellency. By applying different materials, KIMBLADE is able to have excellent mechanical properties and functions as a special purpose wiper.
 

 
 
 
 


Quickly and effectively wipes away! One wipe instantly cleans and dries!
 

Even when your wiper does not work, you can drive safely if you have a clear view. 
  If raindrops can flow down instead of remaining on the glass, refraction of light is minimized and the view distortion is reduced.
 

The water-repellent and other special substances applied to the silicone blade make KIMBLADE wiper act like water-repellent coating of the windshield, and help clear the view even during pouring rain.
 


KIMBLADE Wiper – specially made with water-repellent substances
Made with water-repellent substances, KIMBLADE wiper transfers water-repellent coating from the wiper squeegee to the windshield. When your wipers aren’t working well, first remove dust and wipe off all the water from the windshield. Next, turn on the wipers and operate for three minutes so the water-repellent coating is applied again. (Before wiping the dry glass, all foreign substances on the glass and dust on the wiper blade should be removed to protect the glass and the wiper.)
 

 
 

 
 


Existing wiper blades along with the plastic frame need to be replaced at the end of its lifespan.
 

KIMBLADE wiper frame does not need to be replaced. If the blade is accidentally torn by sharp material, etc., KIMBLADE can replace only the blade insert without the need for complete wiper replacement. The blade inserts are made from 100% silicone, which can be switched out and recycled. This makes KIMBLADE not only economical but also environmentally friendly.
 
 The wiper frame is also sturdy and flexible, allowing it to adhere closely to the curved windshield for more effective wiping.
 

 

From the first round of feedback, we learned that the windshield surface condition is directly related to the performance and durability of a wiper. Thus, we conducted extensive research and tests to come up with a solution.Here are some of our findings that you might not have been aware of.Problems like vibration, noise, or blurring that are considered as problems of the wiper, are greatly affected by the condition of the windshield. Whether or not you regularly maintain and care for your windshield and the kind of cleaning agent used can affect a wiper’s lifespan. To this end, we have conducted a thorough R&D and came up with a cleaning solution made specifically for windshields. We greatly appreciate all the feedback from the Backers.
 
 


 
  
 


Windshields are different from other glasses because they protect the drivers from automobile exhaust gases, fine dust generated during driving, engine oil dropped on the ground, insects, etc. Most people clean their windshield as if they would clean glass with a regular glass cleaner. This may seem okay at first, but the unremoved contaminants adsorbed in the glass can obstruct the view on rainy days and interfere with the wiper operation. Also, waxes or coatings applied to windshields can present serious problems with the wiper operation.
 


Unlike other glass surfaces of automobiles, a windshield is a surface that protects the driver from various contaminants and is in contact with the rubber part of the wiper. The smooth operation of the wiper depends on its compatibility with the coating agent applied to the glass surface. A typically used glass coating agent is not generally compatible with the wiper, and it may lower a wiper’s performance and create noise. You may end up in an unfavorable situation if the wiper does not work when it ought to.
 
 

 Ceramic in Nano Cleaner helps remove contaminants from the tiniest cracks in the glass that are not visible to the human eye. The graphene in the Nano Treatment makes the glass more transparent and coats fine cracks from which contaminants are removed.
 

 
 
 KIMBLADE Cleaner can remove tough tars, grease stains, and excess or unwanted wax from the windshield. We compared how well a regular cleaner and KIMBLADE Nano Cleaner cleaned oil from a glass surface by spraying water to a surface that had been cleaned with the two products. We noticed that the regular glass cleaner did not remove oil completely and there were water droplets on the surface. On the contrary, KIMBLADE Nano Cleaner removed oil completely and did not leave any water droplets. Do you see how well KIMBLADE Nano Cleaner works?
 
 
 Remove contaminants with KIMBLADE Nano Cleaner, then apply Nano Treatment to the clean surface to protect and make the surface water-repellant.
 
 
 KIMBLADE Nano Cleaner & Treatment in a pouch allows you to care for and maintain your windshield like a pro.
 
 
 Can you imagine driving without wipers on rainy days?
Typical water-repellent coatings are not naturally compatible with wipers and can cause noise or ineffective wiping. KIMBLADE Nano Cleaner Bundle is made with the consideration of the compatibility between the wiper and the coating material, so, not only does the wiper move more smoothly, but it also lasts longer.
 
 
 


 




 

 

 


A general wiper gradually removed the water-repellent coating as it wiped the windshield. However, the KIMBLADE wiper did not remove the water-repellent coating. Since KIMBLADE Nano Healing Bundle helps maintain the water-repellent coating and provides professional care, you do not have to worry about the maintenance of your wiper anymore. 
 
 


It is difficult to find a company that cares about increasing the life span of a wiper, as well as the condition of the windshield. Our developers communicated with Backers and users to identify actual problems and as a result, they successfully developed a wiper blade with superior quality and functionality.
 
 


 
 


 
 
 


 
 
 


 
 


 
 


 
 



We have established a wiper blade finder system, which will allow you to identify the necessary information and specs about the vehicle.

<p>In order to thanks our previous supporters who purchased a WIN Max 1035 G7 version, we took the decision to offer the possibility of straight away buying a new motherboard rather than only offering the option of buying the whole device again. If you feel comfortable enough to proceed by yourself for the motherboard swapping, we will gladly sell you a motherboard which would be cheaper than buying a new device.</p>
<p><strong>GPD will provide the following parts:</strong></p>
<p>1. A tutorial video for replacing the motherboard disassembly and installation.</p>
<p>2. An USB drive with built-in system firmware.</p>
<p>3. A screw driver.</p>
<p>4. A pack of thermal conductive silicone grease.</p>
<p>Please note that even with complete and detailed tutorial videos and tools, risks are remaining, especially dismantling and replacing the motherboard for those who lack experience in this field. If you are inexperienced or risk averse, please consider seriouly before choosing this option.</p>
<p>Please pay much attention:The motherboard is a PCBA component packaging technology. Replacing the motherboard is equivalent to replacing the SoC and LPDDR. However, the motherboard does not include SSD. Because SSD is replaceable, the price of the motherboard does not include SSD.</p>

<p>“Handheld x Gaming Laptop” is a concept offered by GPD whom is the sole practitioner. It has been proved at several instances that the WIN Max is an excellent choice for users wanting a versatile large-screen handheld device. Not only the concept of an all in one device enables it to be used to play games but also to be used as a fully fledge laptop for office work, but users' needs are endless!</p>
<p>In example, for users focusing on productivity, the Win MAX AMD Ryzen 7 4800U version will be a more suitable device. After all, performances of the 8C/16T during parallel multitasking processing is obviously better, especially when the program requires compiling.</p>
<p>When 16 threads are fully unlocked , the performance is comparable to the Intel Xeon E5-2630 v3, meanwhile the power consumption is only 1/4 of the latter. On the other hand for high core performance based softwares, the Intel Core i7-1195G7 have to be prioritized. Meanwhile many programs require multi-threads when compiling, some others requires for each single core to run at its highest speed, the higher the efficiency is, the higher the performance is, especially for gaming.</p>
<p>In order to meet the requirements of most users, we made a sensible upgrade to the WIN Max: the new version will be called WIN Max 2021 and not only there is Intel versions; the i7-1195G7; but we also provide an AMD Ryzen 7 4800U upgrade for the first time in GPD's story, the world’s first handheld gaming laptop with an AMD processor.</p>
<p>Customers who purchased older WIN Max (1035G7) can buy the newest motherboard through this crowdfunding campaign and switch with the older one in order to upgrade their WIN Max into in a more powerful device.</p>

<p>As a product focusing  on gaming, the WIN Max needs to be robust and durable. As such, we've decided to design it with a lid made of CNC magnesium-aluminum alloy and a main body made of LG-DOW 121H aviation-grade anti-shock ABS synthetic resin. The device features 1.3mm shell thickness with high-temperature resistance and compliant to the V-0 grade fire protection specification, 109R Rockwell hardness, 26000kg / cm2 bending resistance, which results with an intact rate of 92% in 5m drop tests.</p>

<p>WIN 3 users should have a good understanding of Intel Tiger Lake UP3's performances while gaming. Not only WIN Max 2021 has an Intel Tiger Lake UP3 version, but it has an AMD Ryzen 7 4800U version aswell. What are the performance difference between this two types of processor in game? The following table depicts the frame rate value in low settings at the 1280×800 resolution in several games:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627367606/tvkpzro6yzmgxwdhnmro.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>It can be seen that on i7-1195G7 WIN Max 2021 based, game frame rate is generally much higher, thanks to the Intel Iris Xe GFX core!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624340299/bhp1trjxw6w5plpk0ydd.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>WIN Max 2021 has an 8-inch H-IPS panel, the 5th generation Corning Gorilla Glass screen. The display area is 133% larger than the previous generation, with 67% DCI-P3 wide color gamut, flickerless, 350-nits brightness. The pixel density is twice higher than a 24-inch/1080P display, and the horizontal viewing angle is as high as 178°. It supports 10-point touch, the default resolution is 1280×800, which perfectly supports old games with 1024×768 resolution (4:3).</p>
<h3>Is it true that the higher the resolution, the better? Let's talk about the misconception around high resolution screens!</h3>
<p>With an 8-inch screen with only a physical resolution of 1280×800, game visual quality and experience are better! Reducing the resolution in order to get higher frame rate in game will cause the visual quality to be rougher and fuzzier. Please find as example the following screenshots comparison:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621317277/o3a6kaog1s26p2cjzmrd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Figure 1. With a physical resolution of 1280×800, the overall visual quality is sharp.</p>
<p>Figure 2. Reducing resolution from 2560×1600 to 1280×800, the image quality is getting rough and fuzzy, there are jagged lines on the screen, and the pixels are grainy.</p>
<p>Do not be fooled by high resolution, the current gen of integrated graphics module aren't enough performant yet and the result is still remaining the same as before: high resolution = low FPS, low resolution = high FPS.</p>
<p>Taking Cyberpunk 2077 as an example, you can see frame rate performance at different resolutions:</p>

<p>In terms of analog joysticks, WIN Max 2021 adopts a sink-in design and Xinput API , similarly to the Xbox 360 controller. The ultra-durable dual 3D joysticks produced by Japan Alps offers L3 / R3 functions (on a 360 ° rotation use) by being pressed down. In terms of use  lifespawn, the potentiometer and center stack of the joystick can be used for 2 million and 5 million spins respectively. To avoid finger-slipping during gaming, the joysticks have curved rocker caps made of hard materials with strong resistance (the right joystick is in the same position as on the GPD WIN).</p>

<p>In terms of  D-pad, WIN Max 2021 uses an unibody one with split arrow keys like on the PS4 controller to facilitate subtle precise movement. The ABXY buttons are still made with double symbole inner printing, with appropriate spacing between the buttons that facilitates comfortable use without miss-press.</p>

<p>Online gamers love good keyboards aswell and WIN 2's pan-shaped keyboard can't meet their requirements due to problems such as narrow pitches, short key stroke and lack of tactile feedback. In order to adress those problems, we decided to use a scissor-shaped membrane keyboard for WIN Max 2021 design, for which we purposely increased the screen frame to be able to fit it.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621233137/oyspb0k7qkzcenvzz4ml.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Especially because of the two sets of keys;""QWER"" and ""ASDF"", which are most commonly used by players; main keys size can't be reduced in order to achieve desktop-level tactile feedback. Under these circumstances, WIN Max 2021 adopts a standard ""QWERTY"" chiclet-style full keyboard layout with backlight, making it easy to transform the machine into a perfect mini-gaming laptop by connecting an external mouse.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621234180/ldtsmzxnuqljfrrbaris.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Whenever you  don't have an external mouse but you want to play games requiring one, just turn the “mouse / joystick” switch on the side of machine, it would immediately turn the joystick into a track point and L1 / R1 as mouse click left / right, allowing you to use the machine as a handheld, making it fit for more usage scenarios than gaming only.</p>
<p>Even without the mouse / joystick switch function, WIN Max 2021 also has a built-in touchpad, which supports gestures  up to three-fingers and  mouse click operations.</p>
<p>Whether for gaming or office work on the go or at fixed locations, WIN Max's built-in handle + touchpad can be used  for many use, anywhere, any time.</p>

<p>The BIOS can dynamically adjust the fan speed from 2700 ~ 6300 RPM based on the internal temperature from 20 ℃ to ~ 80 ℃, 70℃ being the second temperature threshold triggering the increase of fan speed.</p>
<p>At the same time, the BIOS also contains three TDP schemes (15W, 20W, 25W)  which can be customised, allowing gamers to choose what match the most their needs and offers the ability to achieve best energy efficiency ratio and heat dissipation effect depengind their applications.</p>

<p>Due to the integrated PCIe 4.0 bus specification, the bus bandwidth is doubled. The WIN Max with a built-in Intel processor perfectly supports PCIe Gen 4 SSD and is backward compatible with PCIe Gen 3 SSD. The theoretical read and write peak is as high as 7.877GB/s. The system's virtual memory’s speed is doubled at the same time, and the game’s smoothness is greatly improved.</p>
<p>The following table shows the read/write test of WIN Max and WIN 3 with PCIe Gen4 SSD built-in, and compared with Surface Pro 7. It can be seen that the sequential read of Samsung 980 Pro 500GB exceeds 5000MB/s, and the sequential write is over 3300MB/s. The read speed even exceeds USB4!</p>

</div></div>","In order to thanks our previous supporters who purchased a WIN Max 1035 G7 version, we took the decision to offer the possibility of straight away buying a new motherboard rather than only offering the option of buying the whole device again. If you feel comfortable enough to proceed by yourself for the motherboard swapping, we will gladly sell you a motherboard which would be cheaper than buying a new device.
GPD will provide the following parts:
1. A tutorial video for replacing the motherboard disassembly and installation.
2. An USB drive with built-in system firmware.
3. A screw driver.
4. A pack of thermal conductive silicone grease.
Please note that even with complete and detailed tutorial videos and tools, risks are remaining, especially dismantling and replacing the motherboard for those who lack experience in this field. If you are inexperienced or risk averse, please consider seriouly before choosing this option.
Please pay much attention:The motherboard is a PCBA component packaging technology. Replacing the motherboard is equivalent to replacing the SoC and LPDDR. However, the motherboard does not include SSD. Because SSD is replaceable, the price of the motherboard does not include SSD.

 

“Handheld x Gaming Laptop” is a concept offered by GPD whom is the sole practitioner. It has been proved at several instances that the WIN Max is an excellent choice for users wanting a versatile large-screen handheld device. Not only the concept of an all in one device enables it to be used to play games but also to be used as a fully fledge laptop for office work, but users' needs are endless!
In example, for users focusing on productivity, the Win MAX AMD Ryzen 7 4800U version will be a more suitable device. After all, performances of the 8C/16T during parallel multitasking processing is obviously better, especially when the program requires compiling.
When 16 threads are fully unlocked , the performance is comparable to the Intel Xeon E5-2630 v3, meanwhile the power consumption is only 1/4 of the latter. On the other hand for high core performance based softwares, the Intel Core i7-1195G7 have to be prioritized. Meanwhile many programs require multi-threads when compiling, some others requires for each single core to run at its highest speed, the higher the efficiency is, the higher the performance is, especially for gaming.
In order to meet the requirements of most users, we made a sensible upgrade to the WIN Max: the new version will be called WIN Max 2021 and not only there is Intel versions; the i7-1195G7; but we also provide an AMD Ryzen 7 4800U upgrade for the first time in GPD's story, the world’s first handheld gaming laptop with an AMD processor.
Customers who purchased older WIN Max (1035G7) can buy the newest motherboard through this crowdfunding campaign and switch with the older one in order to upgrade their WIN Max into in a more powerful device.
 


As a product focusing  on gaming, the WIN Max needs to be robust and durable. As such, we've decided to design it with a lid made of CNC magnesium-aluminum alloy and a main body made of LG-DOW 121H aviation-grade anti-shock ABS synthetic resin. The device features 1.3mm shell thickness with high-temperature resistance and compliant to the V-0 grade fire protection specification, 109R Rockwell hardness, 26000kg / cm2 bending resistance, which results with an intact rate of 92% in 5m drop tests.

The bottom shell has arc-shaped edges, the hollowed-out air inlet area accounts for up to 49.7% of the surface, and the 3mm high foot pads help the air intake at the bottom to improve the airflow.

Trigger buttons L1/L2, R1/R2 are distributed on each sides at the back meanwhile the interfaces are gathered in the center: 2×USB 4 (2×USB 3.2 Gen2 Type C for the 4800U version), 2×USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A, HDMI, 9 heat air outlets at the rear.

WIN 3 users should have a good understanding of Intel Tiger Lake UP3's performances while gaming. Not only WIN Max 2021 has an Intel Tiger Lake UP3 version, but it has an AMD Ryzen 7 4800U version aswell. What are the performance difference between this two types of processor in game? The following table depicts the frame rate value in low settings at the 1280×800 resolution in several games:

*Note
Testing environment: i7-1195G7 / R7 4800U, 16GB LPDDR4x 4266, 1TB NVMe SSD, 1280×800, Windows 10 Home 20H2. The previous games are from low to medium settings.
It can be seen that on i7-1195G7 WIN Max 2021 based, game frame rate is generally much higher, thanks to the Intel Iris Xe GFX core!
 


WIN Max 2021 has an 8-inch H-IPS panel, the 5th generation Corning Gorilla Glass screen. The display area is 133% larger than the previous generation, with 67% DCI-P3 wide color gamut, flickerless, 350-nits brightness. The pixel density is twice higher than a 24-inch/1080P display, and the horizontal viewing angle is as high as 178°. It supports 10-point touch, the default resolution is 1280×800, which perfectly supports old games with 1024×768 resolution (4:3).
Is it true that the higher the resolution, the better? Let's talk about the misconception around high resolution screens!
With an 8-inch screen with only a physical resolution of 1280×800, game visual quality and experience are better! Reducing the resolution in order to get higher frame rate in game will cause the visual quality to be rougher and fuzzier. Please find as example the following screenshots comparison:

Figure 1. With a physical resolution of 1280×800, the overall visual quality is sharp.
Figure 2. Reducing resolution from 2560×1600 to 1280×800, the image quality is getting rough and fuzzy, there are jagged lines on the screen, and the pixels are grainy.
Do not be fooled by high resolution, the current gen of integrated graphics module aren't enough performant yet and the result is still remaining the same as before: high resolution = low FPS, low resolution = high FPS.
Taking Cyberpunk 2077 as an example, you can see frame rate performance at different resolutions:

As you can see from the previous table, when the resolution is 2560×1600, Cyberpunk 2077 has only 8 frames per second, the game is unplayable!
 

In terms of analog joysticks, WIN Max 2021 adopts a sink-in design and Xinput API , similarly to the Xbox 360 controller. The ultra-durable dual 3D joysticks produced by Japan Alps offers L3 / R3 functions (on a 360 ° rotation use) by being pressed down. In terms of use  lifespawn, the potentiometer and center stack of the joystick can be used for 2 million and 5 million spins respectively. To avoid finger-slipping during gaming, the joysticks have curved rocker caps made of hard materials with strong resistance (the right joystick is in the same position as on the GPD WIN).

In terms of  D-pad, WIN Max 2021 uses an unibody one with split arrow keys like on the PS4 controller to facilitate subtle precise movement. The ABXY buttons are still made with double symbole inner printing, with appropriate spacing between the buttons that facilitates comfortable use without miss-press.

The L1 / L2 R1 / R2 buttons have highly-reliable Panasonic micro switches, with mechanical service life reaching 10 million use and electrical service life reaching 100,000 times, aswell as an operating temperature of -54 ~ 177 degrees Celsius.

Select, Xbox, Start buttons are located near the top left hinge to facilitate operation with left thumb. Clicking the Xbox button while streaming an Xbox game can turn on / off the joystick and activate functions such  as ""home screen"", ""long press to turn off"", ""screen capture"", ""snap to position"".
 

Online gamers love good keyboards aswell and WIN 2's pan-shaped keyboard can't meet their requirements due to problems such as narrow pitches, short key stroke and lack of tactile feedback. In order to adress those problems, we decided to use a scissor-shaped membrane keyboard for WIN Max 2021 design, for which we purposely increased the screen frame to be able to fit it.
Especially because of the two sets of keys;""QWER"" and ""ASDF"", which are most commonly used by players; main keys size can't be reduced in order to achieve desktop-level tactile feedback. Under these circumstances, WIN Max 2021 adopts a standard ""QWERTY"" chiclet-style full keyboard layout with backlight, making it easy to transform the machine into a perfect mini-gaming laptop by connecting an external mouse.

Whenever you  don't have an external mouse but you want to play games requiring one, just turn the “mouse / joystick” switch on the side of machine, it would immediately turn the joystick into a track point and L1 / R1 as mouse click left / right, allowing you to use the machine as a handheld, making it fit for more usage scenarios than gaming only.
Even without the mouse / joystick switch function, WIN Max 2021 also has a built-in touchpad, which supports gestures  up to three-fingers and  mouse click operations.
Whether for gaming or office work on the go or at fixed locations, WIN Max's built-in handle + touchpad can be used  for many use, anywhere, any time.
 

To improve thermal performance, WIN Max 2021 adopts a PC-grade cooling solution with  high-power twin turbo fans + dual heat pipes, high-displacement side-blowing design, 9-hole ultra-short-distance ventilation highly efficient which is 8 times stronger than WIN 2's heatsink.

The BIOS can dynamically adjust the fan speed from 2700 ~ 6300 RPM based on the internal temperature from 20 ℃ to ~ 80 ℃, 70℃ being the second temperature threshold triggering the increase of fan speed.
At the same time, the BIOS also contains three TDP schemes (15W, 20W, 25W)  which can be customised, allowing gamers to choose what match the most their needs and offers the ability to achieve best energy efficiency ratio and heat dissipation effect depengind their applications.
 

Under single-core performance test, i7-1195G7 performs outstandingly well, surpassing the desktop flagship i9-10900K, resulting in better gaming performance. Under multi-core performance test, R7 4800U has obvious advantages. After all, with 8C/16T,  each core full-speed being able to reach 3.2GHz, multi-task parallel processing surpasses Intel Xeon processor E5-2630 v3.
For a productivity tool, the higher the score of multi-core performance is, the better. We used PCMark 10 for the benchmark test and got the following scores:

From basic function tests to productivity and digital creation, the R7 4800U scores are far ahead, while the gaming score is pulled down. However, the overall score is still the highest.
 

Gamers know that the MX100 to MX400 series launched by Nvidia are unique, carrying the important task of enhancing the graphical aspects of games for thin and light notebooks. The current generation of Intel iGPU is usually compared with the NVIDIA MX series. The picture below shows the benchmark test for the two GPU on 3DMark against the MX350. The Intel Iris Xe GPU wins with 768 shaders.

One of the criteria for evaluating the performance for a GPU is the floating-point computing capability, which includes half-precision (FP16), single-precision (FP32), and double-precision (FP64). The following table is a comparison of floating-point operations on the three mobile graphics cards:

Intel Iris Xe iGPU's performance is the strongest; AMD Radeon Vega 8’s half-precision and single-precision floating-point computing capabilities also surpass the MX350.
 

WIN Max’s excellent heat dissipation design enables the TDP to stabilize at the peak level for a long while under high power consumption, giving full play to the 86GB/s memory bandwidth advantage of LPDDR4x 4266 under dual channels. The following table is the memory benchmark test done with a TDP of 35W power consumption:

* The three scores represent read, write, and copy speed during the test, the corresponding products are all dual-channel.
 

Due to the integrated PCIe 4.0 bus specification, the bus bandwidth is doubled. The WIN Max with a built-in Intel processor perfectly supports PCIe Gen 4 SSD and is backward compatible with PCIe Gen 3 SSD. The theoretical read and write peak is as high as 7.877GB/s. The system's virtual memory’s speed is doubled at the same time, and the game’s smoothness is greatly improved.
The following table shows the read/write test of WIN Max and WIN 3 with PCIe Gen4 SSD built-in, and compared with Surface Pro 7. It can be seen that the sequential read of Samsung 980 Pro 500GB exceeds 5000MB/s, and the sequential write is over 3300MB/s. The read speed even exceeds USB4!

* Test software: AS SSD Benchmark;
* Test environment: 1195G7 / 1165G7, LPDDR4x 4266, Samsung 980 PRO 500GB;
* Different versions of the AS SSD benchmark test  may give different results , and the heat dissipation will severely affect the read/write speed;
* The standard configuration of  mass-produced SSD is PCIe Gen3. If you want to meet the speed of the SSD in the chart, please purchase and replace it with a PCIe Gen4 one by yourself.
On the other hand, AMD’s WIN Max 2021 is also designed to be compatible with PCIe Gen4 SSD. However the R7 4800U has PCIe 3.0 bus specification, you can still buy PCIe Gen4 SSD and enjoy the peak speed of 3.938GB/s (due to the PCIe 3.0×4 interface bandwidth limit, theoretical throughput upper limit is 3.938GB/s).
*Note
WIN Max 2021 only supports M.2 NVMe 2280 SSD single-sided device layout, such as Samsung 980 PRO, while Lenovo NGFF SL700 isn't compatible. Please note the distinction when replacing the SSD. Since the design is compatible with PCIe Gen4 SSD protocol, WIN Max 2021 will no longer support M.2 SATA3 2280 SSD with AHCI protocol.

Since the design is compatible with PCIe Gen4 SSD protocol, WIN Max 2021 will no longer support M.2 SATA3 2280 SSD of AHCI protocol.
 

Another highlight of WIN Max 2021 is the integration of dual USB4 interfaces (the 4800U version of WIN Max 2021 is dual Type C and does not support USB4). Through the external graphics dock, whether it is using the internal display or an external monitor, the number of frame per second during gaming can be improved by over 300%.
In addition, USB4 natively supports USB4, HDMI, DisplayPort, RJ-45 network port, audio port, charging, and other protocols, and is backward compatible with early USB 3.x, 2.x, and 1.x devices.

*Note
eGFX device is a standard defined by Intel, which includes a complete set of external graphics solutions, including power supply, motherboard, graphics card, interface, etc. The eGPU term only represents the graphics card. At present, retail platforms do not call eGFX uniformly. There are eGPU, graphics card dock, external graphics card box, external graphics card dock, etc., which refer to eGFX. When connecting to an external graphics dock, the frame rate depends on the performance of the external graphics card.
In addition to external eGFX devices, the USB4 interface of WIN Max 2021 supports power adapters based on PD 2.0 / 3.0 protocol and 15V or 20V voltage, which is very scalable. For instance:
1. Any PD 2.0 / 3.0 protocol power bank or adapter with a charging voltage of 15V or 20V on the market can charge WIN Max 2021.

2. Through the USB4 interface, while outputting high-definition video signals to any monitor, the monitor can charge WIN Max 2021 at the same time!

3. Through USB4 interface, WIN Max 2021 supports connecting 2 4K monitors or 1 8K monitor output.

4. PCIe Gen 4 SSD, external mobile hard disk or USB4 flash disk can be connected to a USB4 docking station to provide convenience for professional photographers, in  exemple in order to transfer large files such as m2ts video files!


In addition to gaming, in industrial applications, WIN Max 2021 which is based on powerful processor performance and multi-interface input, is the best productivity tool. Particularly the AMD R7 4800U version of WIN Max with its 8C/16T multi-threaded parallel processing capability. Whether you are doing program compilation, IT operation, and maintenance, image design, or basic office editing, its high efficiency and level of productivity is baffling.

The contributions listed in the project page include international express freight (including additional charges for delivery to remote areas) but do not cover tariffs incurred when entering the destination countries. Generally, the VAT rate for delivery of products to EU countries and Japan is 21% and 10%, respectively; in the case of the United States, tariff is required to be paid for products valued at more than $800; other countries may impose even higher tariff rates.
B. What after-sales services are available for those participating in the crowdfunding campaign?
Users participating in crowdfunding enjoy the same warranty benefits as the purchasers of officially launched products. Any user who is dissatisfied with the product can return it within one week of reception, but shipping cost for delivery of the product to the user will be deducted from the refund upon successful return.
Please note that postage and packaging costs incurred for the return should be borne by the user. When returning the product, please use local postal courier. If you use other international logistics services, the returned product will incur a tariff equivalent to 20% to 30% of its value when entering China, for which GPD won't be held responsible.
C. What if the crowdfunding target is not reached?
Even if the target amount is not reached, we will still send the products to those who have contributed to the project. At that time, we will find other financing channels to ensure the mass production of the final product. Players who love this product are advised to pay close attention to the latest updates on the project.

In other words, you never have to worry whether your screen is too big. As for angles, the camera can be at 30˚ from your screen and it still auto-calibrates with no problem. This gives you more flexibility to leave the camera where it is most convenient to you, depending on the room and display you want to set it up at.   This is exciting because V Board uses an advanced Projection Transformation algorithm that allows the camera to work at a wide angle range.When you see a screen from the side instead of straight on, it’s not a perfect rectangle. V Board takes that distorted screen dimension into account to display the correct image that you intended to draw. Other products similar to V Board are simply not advanced enough to provide that same ease of use.   *both Tripod and Wall Mount accessories are included in each reward Tripod: Use if you see yourself using V Board in different rooms, settings, and on multiple displays. The tripod ensures your camera stays fixed during use while being easy to set up.  Wall Mount: Use if your room is used for a specific work purpose. For example, meeting rooms, classrooms, and office rooms are great places to mount V Board on the wall since you know exactly where the display or projector will always be.   Over the past decade, extensive amounts of research has been conducted on the effects of Interactive Whiteboards (IWBs) as schools around the world integrate them into the traditional classroom setting.Click “Learn More” to read the full paper!      A quick QR scan on your tablet PC or mobile phone provides real-time updates from one screen to another.

But, wood has character, texture, and luster that you can’t get from any other material.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627624768/fv0jbfavhihjplxqurqq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Whether you prefer the rich mid-century styling of walnut or the clean modern look of maple hardwood, the natural variation in grain will ensure that each and every Model 100 will have a gorgeous and unique personality.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/dbp8x4rdj4o830w/best.gif?dl=1"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627599217/sudcwozt4xgsc8epsf6v.png"" src=""""/></p><p>From the positions of the keys to the shapes of the keycaps to the shape of the enclosure, we built the Model 100 to give you the best possible typing experience.</p><h3> A key layout based on your hands</h3><p> We've aligned the Model 100's keys in columns so they're easier to reach without having to contort your fingers. The keys are angled to help you keep your wrists in a natural, neutral position.</p><p>To make it as easy as possible for new typists to get started, the Model 100's default layout is based on QWERTY. Since the physical shape of the keyboard isn't limited by the traditional shape of a typewriter, we've been able to make some important improvements that make the Model 100 a dream to type on without having to learn to type all over again. (Of course, the Model 100 supports custom layouts, too—every single key is fully programmable.)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627697616/yswlgm4di9xph0fgmlww.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The Model 100 packs the full functionality of a 104 key keyboard (and more) into just 64 keys.</p><p>When we built the Model 01, one of the most controversial layout choices we made was replacing the spacebar with a space key. Again and again, our customers have told us that this is one of their favorite things about our layout. By making space a reasonable size, we’re able to move some of the most frequently chorded keys away from your poor, overworked pinkie fingers to easy to reach arcs right under your thumbs.</p><p>Underneath the thumb arcs, you’ll find one of the Model 100’s most unique features: the palm key. It works like a special Shift or Function key to give you the full power of a 104 key keyboard in just 64 easy to reach keys. Dropping the base of your thumb onto the palm key turns H, J, K, and L into arrow keys, turns the number keys into F-keys and even turns the WASD keys into a high-precision mouse.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/9s4ad3vhdzbnrsw/palm_keys.gif?dl=1"" src=""""/></p><p>You can, of course, fully customize the Model 100’s key layout with our graphical configuration tool.</p><p>The Model 100's generous curved palm rests help support your palms and wrists and gently encourage you to hold your hands in a relaxed, neutral position, rather than bending your wrists while typing.</p><h3>Custom sculpted keycaps</h3><p>Most keyboard manufacturers buy their keycaps from one of a handful of keycap factories in one of a half-dozen generic shapes. We wanted something better, so we designed our own. It took hundreds of hours of engineering, but we’ve made keycaps that actually help you type better. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627663181/slnbcvhcuuoycuwsxptf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The Model 100's keycaps are individually sculpted to gently guide your fingers to the right places, following the natural curve of your hands. This makes it just that little bit easier to hit the right key with the right finger. It feels great if you already touch-type. (And it also dramatically reduces the learning curve for those of us who never learned ""proper"" typing.)</p><h3>Hot-swappable mechanical keyswitches</h3><p>The Keyboardio Model 100 features high-quality hot-swappable MX-compatible mechanical keyswitches. Mechanical switches just feel better to type on than the cheap rubber domes, or low-profile scissor switches you’ll find on most modern keyboards and laptops. We’ve been researching and testing and building keyboards with mechanical switches for nearly a decade and have picked out some of our favorites for the Model 100.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627698865/hmzfqsxy2puq1dwpyngx.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Indiegogo-edition Model 100 keyboards will ship with your choice of three keyswitch options from Kailh, each nestled in a hot-swap socket: Clicky BOX White switches, Tactile BOX Silent Brown switches, or Linear BOX Silent Pink switches. </p><p>The keyboard industry is in the middle of a Cambrian explosion of keyswitch options. New switches are becoming available all the time. Some are extra-clicky. Some are whisper-silent. Some new switches are made from self-lubricating POM. Others are built out of crystal-clear plastic designed to accentuate under-key LEDs. Since the switches aren’t soldered into the circuit board, you’re free to experiment with them all, to find the perfect switch for you.</p><h3>Programmable RGB LEDs under each key </h3><p>We've placed an independently programmable RGB LED underneath each and every key on the keyboard. Out of the box, the Model 100 can breathe, glow and do cute rainbow fade animations with the best of them, but the neat part is that each and every one of those LEDs is end-user controllable.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627663213/vwngx6ooi1vsflngeqvy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>With just a few lines of code, you can completely customize the light show.

No matter what you make, your keyboard is an integral part of how you practice your craft. You deserve a good keyboard.The Keyboardio Model 100 is a customizable ergonomic mechanical keyboard designed from the ground up to work the way you do. It features 64 hot-swappable mechanical keyswitches, individually addressable RGB LEDs under each custom-sculpted keycap, and open source firmware, all housed in a precision-milled hardwood enclosure. When you’re at your desk for hours at a time, absolutely nothing beats the warm, rich feeling of wood under your palms. We’ve been making wooden keyboards since some of our earliest prototypes nearly a decade ago. While they’re certainly eye-catching, what really matters to us is just how comfortable they feel. We’ve built keyboards out of metal. We’ve built keyboards out of plastic. But, wood has character, texture, and luster that you can’t get from any other material.  Whether you prefer the rich mid-century styling of walnut or the clean modern look of maple hardwood, the natural variation in grain will ensure that each and every Model 100 will have a gorgeous and unique personality.From the positions of the keys to the shapes of the keycaps to the shape of the enclosure, we built the Model 100 to give you the best possible typing experience. A key layout based on your hands We've aligned the Model 100's keys in columns so they're easier to reach without having to contort your fingers. The keys are angled to help you keep your wrists in a natural, neutral position.To make it as easy as possible for new typists to get started, the Model 100's default layout is based on QWERTY. Since the physical shape of the keyboard isn't limited by the traditional shape of a typewriter, we've been able to make some important improvements that make the Model 100 a dream to type on without having to learn to type all over again. (Of course, the Model 100 supports custom layouts, too—every single key is fully programmable.)The Model 100 packs the full functionality of a 104 key keyboard (and more) into just 64 keys.When we built the Model 01, one of the most controversial layout choices we made was replacing the spacebar with a space key. Again and again, our customers have told us that this is one of their favorite things about our layout. By making space a reasonable size, we’re able to move some of the most frequently chorded keys away from your poor, overworked pinkie fingers to easy to reach arcs right under your thumbs.Underneath the thumb arcs, you’ll find one of the Model 100’s most unique features: the palm key. It works like a special Shift or Function key to give you the full power of a 104 key keyboard in just 64 easy to reach keys. Dropping the base of your thumb onto the palm key turns H, J, K, and L into arrow keys, turns the number keys into F-keys and even turns the WASD keys into a high-precision mouse.You can, of course, fully customize the Model 100’s key layout with our graphical configuration tool.The Model 100's generous curved palm rests help support your palms and wrists and gently encourage you to hold your hands in a relaxed, neutral position, rather than bending your wrists while typing.Custom sculpted keycapsMost keyboard manufacturers buy their keycaps from one of a handful of keycap factories in one of a half-dozen generic shapes. We wanted something better, so we designed our own. It took hundreds of hours of engineering, but we’ve made keycaps that actually help you type better. The Model 100's keycaps are individually sculpted to gently guide your fingers to the right places, following the natural curve of your hands. This makes it just that little bit easier to hit the right key with the right finger. It feels great if you already touch-type. (And it also dramatically reduces the learning curve for those of us who never learned ""proper"" typing.)Hot-swappable mechanical keyswitchesThe Keyboardio Model 100 features high-quality hot-swappable MX-compatible mechanical keyswitches. Mechanical switches just feel better to type on than the cheap rubber domes, or low-profile scissor switches you’ll find on most modern keyboards and laptops. We’ve been researching and testing and building keyboards with mechanical switches for nearly a decade and have picked out some of our favorites for the Model 100.Indiegogo-edition Model 100 keyboards will ship with your choice of three keyswitch options from Kailh, each nestled in a hot-swap socket: Clicky BOX White switches, Tactile BOX Silent Brown switches, or Linear BOX Silent Pink switches. The keyboard industry is in the middle of a Cambrian explosion of keyswitch options. New switches are becoming available all the time. Some are extra-clicky. Some are whisper-silent. Some new switches are made from self-lubricating POM. Others are built out of crystal-clear plastic designed to accentuate under-key LEDs. Since the switches aren’t soldered into the circuit board, you’re free to experiment with them all, to find the perfect switch for you.Programmable RGB LEDs under each key We've placed an independently programmable RGB LED underneath each and every key on the keyboard. Out of the box, the Model 100 can breathe, glow and do cute rainbow fade animations with the best of them, but the neat part is that each and every one of those LEDs is end-user controllable.With just a few lines of code, you can completely customize the light show. Want your keyboard to start flashing red when you've been typing too long? There’s a plugin for that! Want a key to light up when you’ve got mail? That’s just a few lines of code.Your hands are unique. And everyone’s typing situation is different. What works for one of us may not work for anybody else. We’ve designed the Model 100 to let you position your keyboard at exactly the right distance and angle for you. The two halves of your Model 100 are connected with a standard RJ45 ethernet cable. Out of the box, your keyboard comes with a 10cm interconnect cable so you can position the two halves right next to each other and a 1m cable, so you can place the two halves of the keyboard shoulder-width apart (or wider!) on your desk for a sublimely comfortable typing experience.Adjustable octo-stands for comfortable typingEvery Indiegogo-edition Model 100 keyboard ships with a pair of custom-designed “octo-stands” which let you adjust the tent and tilt of your keyboard for extreme comfort. The stands give you a generous 7.5 degrees of angle to play with. You can choose whether you want the middle of the keyboard higher than the outside edges and whether you want the keyboard to be angled up like most keyboards or angled down with “negative tilt” for a perfect typing experience at a lower desk.Tripod mounts for infinite configurabilityThe octo-stands are a great choice for on-desk adjustability, but we didn't stop there. We wanted to make sure that you could position your Model 100 exactly where you wanted it, so each half of the keyboard features an ISO-standard 1/4-20 camera tripod mount, which you can use to attach a wide variety of mounting gear to the bottom of your keyboard. Nick Handel used camera mounting gear to get himself a vertical under-desk mount for his Model 01Over the past few years, Model 01 users have found a wide variety of innovative ways to attach their keyboards to their chairs, desks, and even to a belt for mountainside hacking.Michael Sloan built a belt mount for his Model 01 and may just have the best ""office"" of all time.You can take it with youEvery Indiegogo-edition Model 100 comes with a free custom-formed protective travel case. The zippered travel case will keep your Model 100 safe on the road. This is the same travel case we currently sell as a $60 accessory for the Model 01.Point and click configuration with ChrysalisYour Model 100 ships with full support for Chrysalis, our cross-platform graphical configuration tool for Kaleidoscope. With support for point-and-click key remapping, custom shortcuts, layout backup and restore, and an upcoming interface for creating Kaleidoscope macros, Chrysalis makes customizing your key layout and LED themes easy and convenient.Chrysalis is, of course, fully open source. You can always download it at https://github.com/keyboardio/ChrysalisOpen source Kaleidoscope firmwareThe firmware powering all our keyboards, Kaleidoscope, is open source and freely available on Github. If you want to build complex macros, add in joystick emulation, or make keys do things we haven't thought of yet, Kaleidoscope is where you'd start.Kaleidoscope is incredibly powerful, but we've worked to make it newbie-friendly. We built it on top of Arduino, to make it easy for folks who aren't familiar with embedded development or C++ to be able to do amazing things. At the same time, you're not restricted to the Arduino IDE when working with it. If vi or Emacs is your weapon of choice, everything's set up to build from the command line using standard tooling.Kaleidoscope comes with dozens of plugins that provide all the things you'd expect from great keyboard firmware, like layouts stored in EEPROM, serial communications, full NKRO, steno, mouse keys, LED effects, and crazy USB tricks. Most new features can be added to Kaleidoscope as plugins. You can find documentation for Kaleidoscope and its many plugins and features at https://kaleidoscope.readthedocs.io. Source code is always available at https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope. We're not a QMK shop, but have worked with community members to land in-tree ports for both the Model 01 and the Atreus. We're committed to supporting a community port of QMK to the Model 100 as well.It comes with source code and a screwdriver We believe, quite strongly, that you own the things you buy from us. Our commitment doesn’t stop at the software. We’ve designed the Model 100 to be easy to open up and mess with. Everything is put together with regular screws, so that it’s easy to disassemble your keyboard with the included screwdriver. The switches aren’t soldered to the PCB, so they’re easy to remove and replace. We’ve placed all of the electrical components on the backs of the PCB, so they’re easy to poke at. Programming pins for the microcontrollers are exposed and labeled.You are 100% welcome to open your keyboard up, flash its firmware, reflash its bootloader, solder weird connectors onto the circuit boards or flash our firmware onto something else. (Some of these things may void your warranty, but don’t let that stop you.) To make all of this as easy as possible for you, your Model 100 will ship with a screwdriver, firmware & bootloader source code, as well as full schematics for the electronics. What comes in the box Clockwise from upper left: the keyboard; short 10cm interconnect cable (for use with halves together); long 1m interconnect cable (for use with halves apart); USB-C cable; interconnect bars; octo-stands with mounting screws; multi-bit screwdriver.Every Indiegogo-edition Keyboardio Model 100 reward comes with:
Keyboardio Model 100
Zippered travel case
QWERTY keycaps
1.5m USB-A to USB C cable
10cm RJ45 interconnect cable
1m RJ45 interconnect cable
Two octo-stands with mounting screws

Keyboardio disassembly screwdriver
Premium keyswitch puller
 Your keyboard will come with your choice of clicky Kailh BOX White, linear BOX Silent Pink switches, or tactile BOX Silent Brown switches and your choice of maple or walnut hardwood enclosure. The switches are 100% hot-swappable, so you’ll be able to change them later.You don't need to make up your mind now. We'll email you closer to the ship date to have you make your selection.We expect Indiegogo-edition Model 100s to ship in January 2022.Add on extra keycap sets This is Jesse's personal Model 01 with Linear A keycaps.Every Model 100 will ship with QWERTY-labeled keycaps preinstalled. But we know that not everybody types QWERTY. You can add sets of Colemak, Dvorak, Linear A, and blank translucent keycaps to your pledge, each for just $30.After the campaign closes, we expect the price for keycaps to be $45 per set.From a quick glance, the Model 100 looks a lot like the Model 01, but when you look closely or start typing on it, you'll begin to notice some of the upgrades and improvements we've made to just about every aspect of the product. The Model 100 retains the Model 01’s distinctive butterfly design, but includes dozens of improvements across every aspect of the product. The Model 100 is a true reinvention of the Model 01 you know and love.These are a few of our favorite upgrades in the Model 100:
Hot-swappable MX-compatible keyswitches from Kailh replace the Matias switches we used in the Model 01. If you ever want to change a switch (or all 64), you can do it at home, no soldering required.
Updated keycaps feature more subtle homing bars to keep your fingers happy, thicker plastic for a more satisfying key feel and shorter skirts for more vibrant under-key LED glow.
A new darker walnut enclosure option looks great on just about any desk.
The overhauled electrical design will be more robust against misbehaving USB hubs, as well as easier to maintain and repair.
Newly reinforced baseplate plastics and updated octo-stands are sturdier, more rigid, and easier to adjust.
We're not going to beat around the bush. If you’ve never used a split keyboard with the keys arranged in columns, it might take a little bit of practice to get up to speed on the Model 100.Most Model 01 typists told us that they started to get familiar with the layout within a few hours. True mastery of the layout is an investment that can take a month or two to really start to pay off.

To give you a sense of the size and shape of the Model 100, we've created a life-size printable paper Model 100. Just download this PDF and hit print. When you print it out, be sure to tell your computer to print at 100% size instead of scaling it up or down to fit the paper. If you have a US Quarter or a 1 Euro coin handy, you can use that to make sure it printed correctly. We’re building the Model 100 with the same manufacturing partner who helped us make the Keyboardio Atreus. While COVID-19 restrictions mean that the U.S.-based team isn’t able to visit the factory in person this time around, they’ve been a pleasure to work with throughout the Atreus production process and the Model 100 design process. Ken, our on-the-ground project manager in China, visits the factory regularly on our behalf.To help get your keyboards built as quickly as possible after the campaign, we’ve paid for most of the tooling for the Model 100 out of pocket, even before launching this campaign.Our Model 100 prototype circuit boards (PCBs) passed FCC pretesting just before the COVID-19 pandemic derailed well, everything in the world. Since then, a major disruption of the global electronics supply chain has caused shortages and huge amounts of pricing instability.Since we need to adjust our designs for the new electronics availability landscape, we’re doing everything we can to sneak in a newer, much more powerful microcontroller before the early-delivery Model 100s ship. As this work progresses, we’ll talk a bit more about this in a backer update and on Twitter.We’re working hard to secure the various ‘long lead time’ components we need to ship the mass-production run of Model 100 keyboards in January of 2022. We plan to fulfill the Model 100 globally using a shipping partner we’ve used before. Your Model 100 and accessories will be produced in Dongguan, China. We have shipping partners in both nearby Shenzhen and across the border in Hong Kong. Depending on timing and logistics, we may end up using one or the other to get your keyboard to you quickly, safely, and inexpensively. We are happy ship to pretty much any country we're legally allowed to; if your country isn't shown as an option, send us a message here on Indiegogo and we'll calculate the shipping costs and add it. Indiegogo-edition Keyboardio Model 100s will ship duty-unpaid (DDU). You will be responsible for any tax or duties associated with your shipment. If you are shipping to the U.S., we expect that any pledge rewards under $800 should ship without you owing any additional taxes or duty. If you are shipping to an address outside the U.S., you will likely owe tax or duty on your pledge rewards. You can estimate how much by searching “duty calculator” and your country name, although the final determination of such things is almost always made by local customs inspectors. The HS code for computer keyboards is 8471.60.20. We type. We type a lot. We've always typed a lot.Over the years, we’d tried pretty much every keyboard out there, but never found one we could fall in love with. We wanted a keyboard that was good to our hands, looked great on our desks and was completely customizable.In 2012, we set out to build our own.In 2015, we launched that keyboard as the Keyboardio Model 01 on Kickstarter. In 2019, we came back to launch our second keyboard, the Keyboardio Atreus in partnership with Technomancy. Over the last six years, we’ve built and shipped thousands and thousands of keyboards to folks in more than 75 countries. For the past year and a half, we’ve been working to reengineer and upgrade every aspect of the Model 01. The Keyboardio Model 100 is the culmination of that work.Keyboardio is a tiny company that designs, manufactures and sells high-end computer keyboards. The founders, Jesse and Kaia, are a husband-and-wife team. We got our start in 2012 when Jesse couldn't find a keyboard that didn't make his wrists hurt and figured he'd spend a month designing and building a keyboard. One thing, as they say, led to another. Today, we have thousands of customers in dozens of countries, professional engineering and project management resources spread across three continents, and international distribution. And we're still just as obsessed with making better keyboards.We wish we could thank everyone we ought to by name, but we found out the hard way that campaign pages have a character limit. Here's an abbreviated list: Thank you to our investors Blaine, Brady, Evan, Jared, Rob, Roy, and Russel; Adam and Richie at Friends 'n Allies (the delightful Oakland-based company behind our video), as well as Whitney and Frazier who helped them make us and our product look good, and the gracious team at Supermarché for their inspiring short film; algernon, Frank, and Ken for all the hard work and long hours bringing our keyboards into the world; Andre, Clarissa, Julio, Phil, Scott, and Zoelle for going above and beyond to help us get the campaign together; our families and friends for indulging us in our keyboard obsession all these years; and Ma, Penny, and Pickles for graciously agreeing to star in our video. And, perhaps most importantly, thank you to all our customers, backers, and open source contributors.

<h2><i>Story &amp; Idea</i></h2>
<p>Recently, like most of the planet, our team started working from home. In the office, we’d share ideas and design by throwing our design pads around and we realized very quickly that we needed a similar solution. Like a better notebook to work and study with, and an ideal companion for computers, tablets, and smartphones. Rather than reinvent the wheel and come up with some digital solution we did what we do best... <strong>we took a simple idea and maybe it better... the BetterBook. </strong>The unique format and ration let you capture &amp; scan your work in seconds, settles nicely by your keyboard and so on...</p>

Recently, like most of the planet, our team started working from home. In the office, we’d share ideas and design by throwing our design pads around and we realized very quickly that we needed a similar solution. Like a better notebook to work and study with, and an ideal companion for computers, tablets, and smartphones. Rather than reinvent the wheel and come up with some digital solution we did what we do best... we took a simple idea and maybe it better... the BetterBook. The unique format and ration let you capture & scan your work in seconds, settles nicely by your keyboard and so on...

 
In short, BetterBook is a better notebook.

 Better at capturing & scanning with your phones 

 Better images displayed with no white/black bars 
 Better fit on your desk just below the keyboard 
 Better note organization and time management

The latest Thunderbolt 4 and USB4 tech make the most of its 4TB (and now 8TB) NVMe M.2 drive to achieve speeds of up to 2,800 MB/s.    Media About Us   We've been receiving similar questions a lot. Below you'll find two reasons why we've decided to introduce lower prices on our Indiegogo Page.1. When introducing our product through Indiegogo, we've adopted direct to consumer approach, which means that we are in direct contact with our backers, without any middlemen and resellers.2. We've just launched our product, and having a trustworthy and loyal backer community is very important to us. We prefer to have an impactful customer base and have a low margin to reach this very goal. Once we move out from Indiegogo, the product prices will increase by around 48%.    GigaDrive is powered by Thunderbolt™4 and USB4. This next-generation universal cable connectivity solution allows GigaDrive to hit stable read and write speeds of up to 2,800 MB/s.  You can backup all your data from laptops, PCs, mobile phones, cameras, and drones in a matter of seconds. No need to install additional software, or use non-privacy-friendly clouds.    What is Thunderbolt 4? 
Thunderbolt 4 is the latest technology introduced by Intel. The new technology can simultaneously offer high-speed data transfers, 2x 4K video output, and charge your computer and other devices. All Thunderbolt 4 ports offer 40Gbps bidirectional read and write speeds. Is it compatible with Thunderbolt 3? 
Short answer — yes, it is. Thunderbolt 4 enabled devices are compatible with many connections powered with USB-C type connectors, including the former versions of Thunderbolt & USB-C.   Throw it! Dip it! Shak it or take it to the Sahara! GigaDrive will still be transferring and streaming data as it did on the first day you got it… Be it a simple coffee spilling or an accidental drop, with its IP67 rating and rugged design, your GigaDrive will withstand it all and beyond. We've tested GigaDrive in extreme conditions — water, dust, and even drops from 10 feet — so you can safely do so too! Whatever happens, your memories and data are fully safe and intact. What is IP67? 
The IP or “Ingress Protection” number shows how resistant products are to water and dust. The first number identifies the SSD's protection against solid objects like dust and sand, where 0 stands for no protection and 6 for 100% protection. The second number indicates protection against liquids, and the numbering ranges from 0 to 8.  IP67 makes sure your GigaDrive is 100% protected from dust and sand and against the effects of full immersion in 3 feet (1m) of water for up to 30 minutes.   When transferring large amounts of data, both internal and external SSDs overheat. The heat build-up can slow down overall performance, throttle transfer speeds, and even damage your device.But no worries — we've designed GigaDrive to be anti-overheat protected. Our DRAM cache chip pre-processes transfers so files can copy simultaneously and efficiently. And the proprietary aluminum shell design ensures steady heat dissipation so your GigaDrive never gets too hot. Together, they make better use of USB4’s and Thunderbolt 3-4’s maximum speed potential, and deliver stable performance without endangering your data.  What’s shell design? 
GigaDrive's shell design incorporates high-grade aluminum alloy for better thermal conductivity.  Dual thermal pads directly applied to your external SSD, and the increased surface area help with heat dissipation, so your files and fingers are safe. What is a DRAM cache chip? 
When you start the data transfer process, the system automatically checks the SSD to see where it will store the data. Thanks to this ""catalog"", GigaDrive already knows where the data is stored and where it should add new data. This is the same system your computer’s DDR4 SDRAM is based on, but applied in this case, directly to your SSD.     There is a reason why GigaDrive is one of the most wanted external SSDs for professional videographers and photographers. It allows you to record RAW footage in 8K with cameras like the Blackmagic series directly to your GigaDrive in real-time — without any additional software, gadgets, or computers.It's also perfect for backing up your video footage and large RAW photos as you go. Shoot comfortably without worrying about running out of space on your SD or CompactFlash cards, and forget about having to invest over $100 in a small 128GB card!  Running out of space on your PC for the newest Call of Duty or Hitman update? Time to give your computer some extra breathing space with GigaDrive — hyperfast and high-capacity external SSD ideal for gamers.With speeds up to 2,800MB/s GigaDrive gives a significant boost to your gaming experience and offers an unmatched bootup time for your favorite games. Modern games with heavy graphics require more and more space. For example Call of Duty: Warzone will take up to 231GB space on your computer and further updates will add to that!With GigaDrive you can enjoy up to 4TB (and now 8TB) additional space to host all your heavy-duty gaming!  As much as it is important to protect the data on your computer, it is important to make sure that data on your external drives are also protected. Your work and personal documents, kid's childhood photos and birthday videos, favorite movies and audio can be protected thanks to GigaDrive's optional encryption feature. Request it and prevent anyone from accessing your data!  Choose the storage size you need. GigaDrive comes in three capacity options — 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB (and now 8TB) — to handle your needs. • Over 4,000,000 photos• About 500 DVDs• Over 800,000 songs• About 340,000,000 pages of documents• About 530,000,000 books Be that thousands of 1GB files or dozens of 100GB ones, GigaDrive's storage capacity is big enough to record HD videos on your iPhone up to 3 hours everyday, every week, every month for a year! From photos of your childhood and high school days, to summer vacation video footage, to computer games and work files, GigaDrive will serve you for years to come.  Sleek, sci-fi-inspired styling with premium brushed aluminum finish pushes GigaDrive's Design a couple of steps further. Irregular shapes, tiny notches on both sides, spaceship-inspired design provide a blended mixture of elegance and functionality.  With only 74g(2.6oz) weight and itsy-bitsy sizes (114 x 37 x 12.5 mm / 4.5"" x 1.5"" x 0.5""), hyperfast and large capacity is no longer the synonym for heavy bricks.Enjoy taking years worth of photos, videos, games and work portfolios with you on just a tiny stick.   ​  GigaDrive Review by The Apple Circle GigaDrive review  GigaDrive review by Tech I Want  GigaDrive Speed Test Demo

<ol></ol>
<p>Storage can be added using the MicroSD card slot in front, or a more permanent solution is by swapping out the SSD with a larger capacity one. We highly suggest that you purchase Pantera in the SSD capacity larger than what you first think you need, as files can really quickly take up space.</p>

That power is provided for by the highly-efficient quad-core<span> </span><span>Intel Celeron J4125</span><span> </span>chip, and is very much capable of multi-tasking, the biggest requirement in today’s productivity work.<br/>          Things like working on presentations, documents, and browsing the web, can be done with perfect ease on the Pantera Pico PC. Video is handled by the Intel UHD graphics which outputs a maximum of 60 frames per second of 4K video.</p>
<p><strong><span>MEMORY AND SSD STORAGE</span></strong></p>
<p>The Pantera Pico PC uses 2 4GB LPDDR4 RAM,<span> </span><span>for a total of 8GB</span>, running in dual-channel memory configuration that significantly doubles the data transfer speed by adding one more channel of communication between the memory and the memory controller. What does that mean for you? Having the RAM configured in dual-channel mode means twice as fast accessing of programs stored in memory, your apps are more responsive, switching between tasks is also twice as fast, and many more performance benefits compared to a computer with only a single-channel RAM configuration.</p>
<p>Inside the Pantera is an M.2 2242 SSD for storing your operating system and files. Choose the storage size you need, Pantera comes in options ranging from 64GB up to a maximum of 1 Terabyte so you can store all your documents, presentations, videos, photos and everything else you might want to keep.</p>
<p>What’s more is that you can expand the storage capacity by adding in a MicroSD card via the front slot, or use your card for transferring files from your DSLR, action camera, or mobile phone to your Pantera with absolute ease.</p>
<p><strong><span>WIRED OR WIRELESS, WE GOT YOU COVERED.</span></strong></p>
<p>When we first put our wishlist of things that need to go into the Pantera Pico PC, we thought of everything possible to keep the balance between functionality, style, power, I/O ports, and of course, connectivity, all while keeping the small form factor the smallest possible.</p>
<p>Pantera has 4 USB Ports around the shell, 2 USB3.0 in front for super fast transfers and ease of access, 1 USB3.0 and 1 USB2.0 at the back. Flash drives, external hard drives and other devices can move data without the long wait time.</p>
<p>It uses dual-WiFi 6 for better wireless connection to a wireless router. It sports Bluetooth 5.1 for your wireless peripherals like wireless keyboards, mouse, earphones, headphones, game controllers, and so much more, with minimal latency that current technology can give. Attach a multi-purpose hub to add even more functionality and the Pantera Pico PC will be happy to take them all in.</p>
<p>Got a wired microphone or headset? No problem. We made sure that the Pantera has a combo speaker/mic port, found at the back right between the USB ports.</p>
<p><strong><span>ULTRA SILENT ACTIVE COOLING</span></strong></p>
<p>Having a processor capable of multitasking means it will be generating heat, which needs to be managed to keep the Pantera working at optimal levels every time. We created the Pantera to have an ultra silent active cooling system so that aside from moving the heat away from the unit, you won’t be bothered with the common fan noise that plagues many computers. At just 19dB, you can watch your movies’ silent parts in peace.</p>
<p><strong><span>YOUR CHOICE OF OPERATING SYTEM</span></strong><br/>          Get your Pantera with Windows 10, or install the Linux of your choice. We’ve tested it to work with many Linux-based distributions like Ubuntu and Linux Mint, our top favorites so far.</p>

<p><strong><span>The Pantera Story:</span></strong></p>
<p>Pantera was a dream of ours for over 6 years. We saw the market for tiny desktop PC’s years ago, but we only had android TV box resources. Our team was busy with different marketing and development projects.</p>
<p>When the recent pandemic happened, people around the world were stuck at home.</p>
<p>The recent work and travel restrictions has shown us how computers and the internet played a role when many workers are forced to work from home. The demand for home computers and laptops have soared simply because most mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, that people already have, just aren’t built for the level of multi-tasking that a full computer offers.</p>
<p>As people have moved to online work, team meetings, and most businesses, these for-work devices are also often not shared among other family members who require powerful enough machines for online classes and the like.</p>
<p>So we set out to find a solution that will alleviate the demand for computers that are up to the task of work-from-home, web-meetings, and online classes, that does not require a lot of setup and is easily portable from one location to another when needed.</p>
<p>Thus, the Pantera Pico PC was born.</p>
<p>It is meant to fill the demand for desktop computers that are capable of doing many, if not all, the necessary tasks needed in this age. All without the high costs of laptops, without the complicated setup requirements, and physical footprint of a full tower build-your-own desktop PC.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing....      PicoPC: A NEW ERA OF DESKTOP PCs  WHAT IS THE COMMON PROBLEM WITH COMPUTERS TODAY?
 
Since the recent advent of remote work and study becoming popular, many people have realized that there is nothing that fills that gap between a powerful desktop, and a laptop when it comes to productivity on-the-go.  Mobile phones do not solve the problem of people needing to have a full-multitasking office computer setup while still being portable, since the amount of work one can do on smartphones is limited. If there are any, they are too bulky, too expensive, or both.

 
THE SOLUTION
 
A tiny portable desktop PC.
      One that gets every job done and fills that void where mobile phones, tablets, and other mobile devices fail miserably.  Pantera Pico PC ticks all the requirements, and meets all your portable office computing needs.


TOP REASONS TO GET A PANTERA PICO PC

Ultra small form factor desktop computer, easily fits most bags
Far lighter than a desktop tower PC
Windows and Linux compatible
Perfect for office or for work-from-home setups
It’s an all-around home entertainment center
It’s Windows 11 ready
User-expandable storage
More USB ports than the competition
Ultra silent active cooling system
Large 360-degree LED power indicator
4K UHD video output
Works as a game center


WHY THE PANTERA PICO PC IS THE RIGHT PORTABLE COMPUTER FOR YOU
The Pantera Pico PC is the perfect device for productivity and entertainment that is willing to go anywhere with you. It is an ultra-small and ultra-light computer, you can put it in the palm of your hand and weighs just about the same as an average smartphone of today. Unlike a tower PC, you can take the Pantera from one room to the other, take it upstairs, downstairs, bring it to the office, without breaking a sweat. We have designed the Pantera to be so small  that when you put it on your desk, your desk will instantly look huge because of all the space you have saved.

 
THE COMPACT VERSATILE COMPUTER
          One wouldn’t expect the Pantera Pico PC to perform as much as it does, coming from such a small package.          Aside from doing office tasks and being a home computer, it can be deployed as an embedded computer, for POS, for digital signages, for CCTV systems, and much more depending on the requirement.

Pantera Pico PC Hightlights


WHY GET A PANTERA PICO PC?1. Small form factor
Small footprint requires very little work area and allows the user more desk space for other things. Unlike its desktop tower counterparts, the Pantera Pico PC is small and ultra-light; it fits in the palm of your hand. So small, that you can put it in your bag and barely notice that it’s even there. Having a tiny shell also means that it requires less power to run, and in fact, it can run on a 12V power bank.
Body dimensions: 6.9cm wide x 6.9cm deep x 5.3cm high
Windows and Linux compatibility
Pantera Pico PC is fully compatible with 64-bit operating systems. Windows 10 runs perfectly smooth and runs happily with nary a hiccup. And since many Linux-based operating systems are lightweight, the Pantera Pico PC is perfectly capable of running popular Linux distributions. We have tested and used Ubuntu Desktop, Linux Mint, along with other Linux distributions, all without issues.
It’s the perfect device for the office, or for work-from-home setups

Pantera Pico PC is the perfect solution for the demand for low-cost office productivity computers. It is capable of being a work-from-home device, for web-meetings, and online classes. It does not require a lot of setup and is easily portable from one location to another when needed.          Hardly even half the price of a regular laptop, it’s a computer that fits in your pocket quite nicely.
It’s a home entertainment center

Watch your movies on your big 4K TV that you recorded yourself or someone else, browse family pictures, even play your music. Coupled with a good internet connection, the Pantera Pico PC can function as a great media-streaming device. You and your family can watch movies on Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, making it a versatile home entertainment device.

It is Windows 11 ready
Microsoft has announced their latest requirements for PCs to be compatible with the latest version of their operating system, Windows 11, and Pantera Pico PC meets and exceeds them. You can rest assured that when Win11 rolls out, you know this device is upgradeable to it when you choose to.
User-expandable storage

Storage can be added using the MicroSD card slot in front, or a more permanent solution is by swapping out the SSD with a larger capacity one. We highly suggest that you purchase Pantera in the SSD capacity larger than what you first think you need, as files can really quickly take up space.

More USB ports than the competition

You can plug in as many as 4 USB peripheral devices on the Pantera Pico PC. It has 3x USB3.0, two of which are located in the front, 1x USB3.0 and 1x USB2.0 at the back. Enjoy blazing fast transfer rates on 3 out of 4 ports, when you need them.
Ultra Silent Active Cooling System
          The ultra quiet fans are engineered to be silentso that you enjoy more of the movies and TV series without being bothered with the usual fan noise most computers have. We made sure the heat-sink is robust to dissipate heat from the processor and away from the device, to keep your Pantera performing at its best at all times.
Large 360-degree LED power indicator

The Pantera Pico PC features a LED lighted strip that wraps around the top lid that can be seen from all directions. This 360-degree-viewable LED strip is helpful since the Ultra Silent Active Cooling System’s fan is so silent, you need to have a way of finding out if the computer is running or not.
4K UHD via HDMI output

Connect your 4K monitor or 4K TV and enjoy up to 60 frames per second for that buttery smooth video. Especially when using the Pantera Pico PC as a media streaming device, having UHD resolution capability brings you clear crisp visuals.

Works as a game center too

For those times when you and your family want some casual gaming, the Pantera Pico PC has been tested to run game titles like Minecraft, CS Go!, and Half-Life 2.

Drop-proof carrying case accesory
Since it is so small, we’ve designed an optional carrying case for you to protect your Pantera Pico PC while being transported.
Choice of EVA cases available as add-ons options during checkout.
Dual-Channel Memory

Apps run faster, multi-tasking and switching between tasks is noticeably quicker compared to other computers with single-channel only memory.
Abundant portable accessories ecosystem

From the portable PicoProjector, to folding keyboards and miniature mice, we have your tiny portable computing needs covered. The PicoPc + PicoProjector + PowerStation weigh around 30% less than the average laptop and are 1/6th the weight of the traditional desktop.  You can view our full accessories add-on offerings during check-out.

 Pantera Specs

TINY MIGHTY PC
Tower desktop computers take up a big portion of your desk space, Pantera Pico PC is designed specifically to be as small as possible while still retaining many capabilities of its gargantuan cousins. The Pantera measures a mere 2.63 x 2.63 x 2.1 inches (67 x 67 x 53 millimeters), and weighs just 0.39 pounds. The outer shell is made from a single block of aluminum, CNC-milled and hard-anodized for the perfect finish, and only the top and bottom are made of durable plastic. It has no problem being carried around in your jacket pocket.

THE PROCESSOR
Despite the Pantera’s diminutive size, there is plenty of power under the hood. That power is provided for by the highly-efficient quad-core Intel Celeron J4125 chip, and is very much capable of multi-tasking, the biggest requirement in today’s productivity work.          Things like working on presentations, documents, and browsing the web, can be done with perfect ease on the Pantera Pico PC. Video is handled by the Intel UHD graphics which outputs a maximum of 60 frames per second of 4K video.
MEMORY AND SSD STORAGE
The Pantera Pico PC uses 2 4GB LPDDR4 RAM, for a total of 8GB, running in dual-channel memory configuration that significantly doubles the data transfer speed by adding one more channel of communication between the memory and the memory controller. What does that mean for you? Having the RAM configured in dual-channel mode means twice as fast accessing of programs stored in memory, your apps are more responsive, switching between tasks is also twice as fast, and many more performance benefits compared to a computer with only a single-channel RAM configuration.
Inside the Pantera is an M.2 2242 SSD for storing your operating system and files. Choose the storage size you need, Pantera comes in options ranging from 64GB up to a maximum of 1 Terabyte so you can store all your documents, presentations, videos, photos and everything else you might want to keep.
What’s more is that you can expand the storage capacity by adding in a MicroSD card via the front slot, or use your card for transferring files from your DSLR, action camera, or mobile phone to your Pantera with absolute ease.
WIRED OR WIRELESS, WE GOT YOU COVERED.
When we first put our wishlist of things that need to go into the Pantera Pico PC, we thought of everything possible to keep the balance between functionality, style, power, I/O ports, and of course, connectivity, all while keeping the small form factor the smallest possible.
Pantera has 4 USB Ports around the shell, 2 USB3.0 in front for super fast transfers and ease of access, 1 USB3.0 and 1 USB2.0 at the back. Flash drives, external hard drives and other devices can move data without the long wait time.
It uses dual-WiFi 6 for better wireless connection to a wireless router. It sports Bluetooth 5.1 for your wireless peripherals like wireless keyboards, mouse, earphones, headphones, game controllers, and so much more, with minimal latency that current technology can give. Attach a multi-purpose hub to add even more functionality and the Pantera Pico PC will be happy to take them all in.
Got a wired microphone or headset? No problem. We made sure that the Pantera has a combo speaker/mic port, found at the back right between the USB ports.
ULTRA SILENT ACTIVE COOLING
Having a processor capable of multitasking means it will be generating heat, which needs to be managed to keep the Pantera working at optimal levels every time. We created the Pantera to have an ultra silent active cooling system so that aside from moving the heat away from the unit, you won’t be bothered with the common fan noise that plagues many computers. At just 19dB, you can watch your movies’ silent parts in peace.
YOUR CHOICE OF OPERATING SYTEM          Get your Pantera with Windows 10, or install the Linux of your choice. We’ve tested it to work with many Linux-based distributions like Ubuntu and Linux Mint, our top favorites so far.

WHAT'S IN THE BOX

                                                   
THE PANTERA TIMELINE
We’ve worked relentlessly over the past year to produce a tiny desktop PC that will be your true portable computing companion for many years. We’ve already done a pilot production run and Pantera is ready to go into mass production.

We've worked just over a year on developing the Pantera. Everything from the hardware, to firmware (BIOS), and accessories have all be fully tested and are ready for mass production.
 
HOW PANTERA CAME TO BE
 


 Prototyping was one of the funnest parts of this journey. We learned a lot and can still learn more with feedback from our testers, reviewers and from you.
We've finalized tooling molds, assembly proceduces and optimized the BIOS firmware. Everything is set and ready for mass production.

The Pantera Story:
Pantera was a dream of ours for over 6 years. We saw the market for tiny desktop PC’s years ago, but we only had android TV box resources. Our team was busy with different marketing and development projects.

The recent work and travel restrictions has shown us how computers and the internet played a role when many workers are forced to work from home. The demand for home computers and laptops have soared simply because most mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, that people already have, just aren’t built for the level of multi-tasking that a full computer offers.

So we set out to find a solution that will alleviate the demand for computers that are up to the task of work-from-home, web-meetings, and online classes, that does not require a lot of setup and is easily portable from one location to another when needed.

Risks and challenges
Please understand that like with any endeavor, there are risks and challenges.
We’ve already opened tooling molds, optimized the BIOS, and have done several pilot production runs.
Nearly 100 reviewers and testers will be receiving a pre-production Pico PC unit and will be giving us feedback. We’ll be monitoring the feedback as an unexpected issue or bug is the only challenge we can see in the foreseeable future.
We’ve secured resources for components so there are not any visible delays.
You may contact us directly at info@xdo.ai for any questions you may have.",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In this demo, our learning engine understands that a triangle sitting on top a square is likely a house with just a few examples - only a tiny fraction compared to conventional deep learning. Applied to FOCI, it reads waveforms from the motion sensor, and learns to differentiate real breathing from noise, <b>see the pattern and match it to different cognitive states, most importantly adapting to you.</b></p>

Mind orbs for your cognitive states
When you're working, don't let distraction slow you down. The Mind Orb switches color when you lose focus. This added self-awareness keeps you on track and focused.Added awarenessYou get to know every minute of focus, distraction, stress, and fatigue. Every detail counts, helping you evaluate how you have performed and how to improve.

Know exactly when you lose focus
 
  Monitoring is not enough, and insight matters. FOCI's AI mind coach gives you real time recommendation to boost your focus.FOCI helps you improve focus in exactly the same way your personal trainer builds your muscles. It knows your potential by analyzing past records, and sets dynamic goals, that encourage you to achieve a little bit more.Overcome distractions and improve focus
When you leave focus or flow, FOCI lets you know you have done well and reminds you to refocus with a gentle vibration at your waist.

When you get distracted, FOCI guides you with mind techniques. Follow the simple steps, and bounce back to focus with speed.Improve performance with mental strategiesWhen attention fatigue hits you after intense work, it is already too late. FOCI suggests you take action before fatigue grows, enabling you to quickly revive your mental agility with restorative mind techniques.Guiding you to better performanceBiometric powered technology provides cognitive trainings that are tailored to you, improving the brain areas that are responsible for analyzing, planning and attention.Tuning into 'flow'
 

Focus is a composite of scientific concepts which is about the ability to:Different features of FOCI are designed to tackle the different aspects of focus.For example, real time visualization of your real mind is designed to improve focus 2 (based on procrastination equation) and also in part focus 4 (based on flow theory), but could potentially reduce focus 1 in some people. Just as mind techniques (based on positive psychology), many may increase focus 2 at the expense of focus 4 and vice versa.The balance of probability and analysis, with many psychological methodologies, is not straightforward, notwithstanding individuality, which is why FOCI's coaching is so important in FOCI to help users make better choices and improve focus.  The human mind is the most complicated object in the known universe.Understanding how it works is the subject of intense research. FOCI is based on two decades of some of the most interesting research into cognition - neuro-respiration.Researchers have established that our breathing pattern is closely correlated with our subconscious, cognitive states. When we consider how our breathing changes when we are stressed or relaxed, this seems intuitive.If you are focused, or distracted, this will be reflected in the tiny movements in your breathing that the motion sensor detects. When a research scientist finds a neuro-respiratory pattern, this requires analyzing a huge data set, and hours of processing. We applied a powerful and agile form of machine learning to do this naturally, in real time - a 10g device, for everyday use.

In this demo, our learning engine understands that a triangle sitting on top a square is likely a house with just a few examples - only a tiny fraction compared to conventional deep learning. Applied to FOCI, it reads waveforms from the motion sensor, and learns to differentiate real breathing from noise, see the pattern and match it to different cognitive states, most importantly adapting to you.

 1. Respiratory Changes in Response to Cognitive Load: A Systematic Review. Neural Plasticity, 20162. Respiration-based emotion recognition with deep learning. Computers in Industry, 2017 Holly M. Sociology and Politics, Cambridge UniversitySo far FOCI has been great! I really like the way it incentivises me to focus more as I want to keep getting as many of the yellow focus balls as I can. I found the cognitive biometrics most useful when I was going to sit down for a long study session, as to keep a check on how focused I was. It's been fab.Sanjan D.  Engineering, Cambridge UniversityFOCI's cognitive biometrics did make me more aware of when I was focused and when not. I did try to increase the amount of focus time that it displayed every day. It tells how far behind I am in terms of focus time compared to yesterday. For example, say it was something like ""12 min to catch up to yesterday”.Eloise K. Physics, Cambridge UniversityThe cognitive biometric was most useful to me when it showed that I had not really been concentrating well and therefore this prompted me to take a break rather than to continue to try and study. Notifications especially ones that were encouraging (even when you aren’t concentrating very well) to motivate you to work.Alex C. Engineering, Cambridge UniversityI’ve been finding it most useful often as a tool to stop me getting distracted on my phone, often I’ll go to pick up my phone and the cognitive biometrics will tell me I’m not in focus and that will often prompt me to start focusing again, almost out of guilt actually! I’ve been finding the vibrations while I’m working very useful.Natasha S. Veterinary Science, Cambridge UniversityMore aware of how I'm working - when i am working. Useful to see 'streaks' forming so i could reassess what i was doing and how. Just the act of putting on/wearing the device to get me into a work/study mood. It'd be the first thing i'd see when i returned to work.

Ever felt like your focus was failing you?Everyone gets distracted, and our team are no different. When we were at university, trying to make deadlines, we tried different productivity techniques, psychological strategies, to stay focused. But we realised the problem was much bigger.However much we tried to focus, we couldn’t escape technology addiction. Working on a screen, communicating by smartphone, digital distraction is unavoidable, and the problem is going to get worse before it gets better. This is preventing us from achieving what we want to in life.But the only solution we are given is to use less tech, to unplug, which is no option in a world where we work on computers.SoWe created FOCI to tackle the root of this problem, to refocus you after distraction, and over time to actually improve your focus.It has been a very exciting challenge, and we are even more excited to share FOCI with the Indiegogo community.

PEEK Technology is typically used in the manufacturing of medical tools, devices, implants, with this breakthrough in kitchenware design, we've developed a pan that is safer, more durable, and most of all, more ""non-stick.""   A pan is the one cooking utensil that really gets put through the wringer. One of our main goals when designing this pan was that it should be able to last, even if put through the most intense conditions, and of course, be made from non-toxic materials.If you have any doubts about the durability of Hard Crafts pans do check out this video. :)    Through using 30,000°F super-heated plasma technology to fuse the Carbon Fusion coating to the surface of the pans, you get an extremely hard surface that interlocks with our premium coating for a superior bond. Hard Crafts pans are extremely strong and super durable. For regular non-stick pans, due to cost considerations,  there's only one side covered with the non-stick coating. But at Hard Crafts, our MELLO series pans are coated in this compound, wrapped around its entirety for an effortlessly polished finish, and easily cleaned every time. We love non-stick pans for daily use, but sooner more often than later they gradually lack their most important function —— the ""non-stick""  loses the ""non."" They scratch easily and start flaking off into your food, and when the coating wears off there’s no going back.     Cast iron and stainless steel pans can absorb quite a bit of oil while cooking, making them difficult to clean when food gets stuck to the bottom. The slippery surface of non-stick pans makes it easier to clean and maintain over time.   Thanks to the Carbon Fusion coating, the integrity of your pan will last from meal to meal even if cleaned with chemical detergent.         Save time, space, and money. Sometimes, you're only one pan away from unlocking endless kitchen possibilities. No more being daunted with hours spent in the kitchen. No more battling with a crusty pan after a long day. Swap the pans stacked in your cabinet, for just one. The one that can do it all.   With all the merits of a flat pan, we’ve designed the MELLO Hybrid deeper, with an enlarged base allowing for it to adapt to a variety of cuisine.    From cooking perfect eggs, to frying steak, making chicken soup or coconut curry, the MELLO Hybrid makes any meal feel like it was meant to be prepared here.   MELLO Hybrid allows you to try your hand at making Korean ramen, quick and easy Thai peanut chicken noodles, bolognese sauce, or even your grandmother’s famous paella.     With a micro-pressure pot cover made from tempered glass, and including a self-stand handle, the MELLO Hybrid improves any meal’s cooking efficiency by thirty percent.        Testimonial Through Kickstarter, we can deliver high-quality pans made with high technology carbon fusion coating and expensive materials to you at a much more affordable price.    Packaging SizesDesign ProcessThe design process will always be at the heart of Hard Crafts.

A second monitor makes working with multiple documents and applications more efficient and helps overall workflow.Glo is the first wireless multi-touch touchscreen with 144Hz display and 24 hours battery life with 1ms response time.

Millimeter-wave technology allow the wireless transmission of popular video interfaces such as HDMIs  and  Display Port .The WirelessHD specification is based on a 7 GHz channel in the 60 GHz Extremely High Frequency radio band. It allows either lightly compressed (proprietary wireless link-aware codec) or uncompressed digital transmission of high-definition video and audio and data signals, essentially giving the best of its quality you can experience.Glo is connected by choosing the  Bluetooth and WiFi network names(of Glo)  on your device  network list and voila! you can connect it with your device and work to your satisfaction no matter where you are . No internet or app is required to use Glo . 4K is a great leap  in visual excellence. It has four times the number of pixels compared to a 1080P display and over 23 times the resolution of standard-definition television.

After all, the CPU, GPU, DDR, and SSD are all drawing power, the lack of it can lead to a decrease of the frequency. Using Prime95 to test memory stability, it was founded that HP EliteBook 845 G7 would crash instantly.</p><p>In a nutshell, we can draw as conclusion that AMD Ryzen 4000 series, with LPDDR4x 4266 memory, systematically has to run at a reduced frequency. Currently, LPDDR4x 4266 can only rely on the Intel 11th generation Tiger Lake-U processor to ensure the use of the 86GB/s memory bandwidth!</p><p>The following table shows the memory benchmark tests done on LPDDR4 3200, LPDDR4x 3733, LPDDR4x 4266:</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608022049/trvsnk11xrmongxqdhlf.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>* Scores are based on the read, write and copy, the corresponding products are all dual-channel devices.</i></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629795895/fbhsnubfxt5usjh37gxm.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>In WIN 3’s built-in Intel 11th generation Tiger Lake-U processor, the biggest highlight is the integration of PCIe 4.0 interface specifications which offers a doubled bandwidth!</p><p>Currently, the sequential read/write of SSD with mainstream M.2 NVMe protocol interface is about 2000 to 3000MB/s.

However, many users did not like the combination of keyboard + clamshell, and strongly asked us to launch an unibody type handheld game console. For our users, after exploration, we referred to the design of the sliding mecanism of the Sony UX series, incorporated the new backlit touch keyboard, and finally designed the WIN 3. It allows us to renew the design of our Win original handheld game console and break the boundaries with the common cliches of clamshell form factor devices. The specifications of WIN 3 are the best according to the current market, and we will mention them one by one later!  Interface description:

  Users who have participated to our previous crowdfunding campaign are no strangers to the WIN Max. The following table is a comparison between WIN 3 and WIN Max:   Unlike the WIN Max, WIN 3 take advantage of the performance of the Intel® Iris® Xe Graphics core graphics card which greatly increase the number of FPS. The following table displays measured data of default game settings at a resolution of 1280×720. *Testing environment: i7-1165G7 & i5-1135G7 / 16GB LPDDR4x-4266 / 500GB NVMe SSD / 1280×720 / Windows 10 Home 64bit  Held with both hands, play games anytime, anywhere. Docking station + device sitting flat on the desktop as a host, with an external monitor, playing games. Docking station + device sitting flat on the desktop, linked to an external mouse, keyboard and monitor;   Pure handheld game console players have high requirements for screen size. In example, 3DS XL's screen is only 4.88 inches, PSV 2000's one is 5 inches, WIN 1's one is 5.5 inches, WIN 2's one is 6 inches, Switch classic's one is 6.2 inches, Switch Lite's one is 5.5 inches. Generally speaking, 5.5 inches is the most common size accepted by the majority of handheld game console players.WIN 3 features a 5.5-inch sliding bright screen, NTSC: 84% (typ), resolution 1280×720, 268PPI, and adopts Corning’s fifth-generation Gorilla Glass, DC dimming, so there is no need to worry about the graininess of the screen. If you own or have used a WIN 1, you should be able to have a better understanding of the experience with this screen size compared to new users. In fact, the 5.5-inch screen size of WIN 1 is the most used and reputable in gaming handheld even today!The main body of WIN 3 still adopts LG-DOW 121H aviation-grade ABS synthetic resin, with Rockwell hardness of 109R and bending strength of 26,000kg/cm2. On the grey version the front side and the lateral sides are silver-gray matte spray, without reflection and with great texture.   On small size handheld game console, the rocker can only adopt a sinking design, with short stroke, small swing distance, high resistance, and the experience is far from being ideal and often inferior to what external gamepad can offers. WIN 3’s protruding ALPS original dual 3D big rocker has large stroke, large swing distance, low resistance, sacrificing a little bit of responsiveness but greatly improves accuracy. For example in a fighting game, the smoothness is comparable to those of Japan’s top joysticks Seimitsu and Sanwa, and it natively supports L3/R3 functions.  The most popular type of games among players are basically FPS, racing games and sports games. In early GPD's handheld game consoles, when users were playing racing games, experience wasn't optimal and quite rough when turning, accelerating, or decelerating. The reason was that the trigger buttons were digital, the signal sent by them was only defined by two states 0 and 1. With the WIN 3, L2 and R2 are changed to analog, with an inclination angle of 27 degrees, which can produce 256 (0 to 255) states and convert the obtained acceleration value into a digital command. If you are an advanced player and are experiencing racing games on the WIN 3, you will notice that experience is greatly improved. The racing will have proper control, shooting will be smoother, just like doing with a real throttle and gun trigger!  WIN 3 is also equipped with dual rumble motors. Its vibration effect will offer you a better immersion during the game. Starting a car engine, shooting a laser gun, controlling a helicopter, etc., everything would feel more real. When shooting, you will feel the gunrecoil, starting an engine will make your body shiver.   The previous WIN series handheld game consoles adopted ordinary stereo dual speakers, at the end the sound quality was always criticized by users. WIN 3 adopts AAC top stereo speakers from Germany. The sound cavity is built with bass materials and adopts a 0.9cc large sound cavity design. The double coil drives the sub and balances its force while  increase its amplitude. Therefore, the sound is more lively and louder.   WIN 3 touch keyboard is hidden behind the screen and adopts the QWERTY full keyboard layout, which take advantage of the dual rumble motors. When the screen is slide open, the white backlight is on and user can experience haptic feedback while typing on it.Why a touch keyboard? Most WIN devices handheld game console users reported that the keyboard is rarely used to play online games: they mainly us it for game account and password inputs. With an unibody handheld game console, if a physical keyboard is added, the body will be too thick and the internal structure design will be too complicated. WIN 3 adopts a thinner touch keyboard, which allows an optimised internal implementation and can free up more space for heat dissipation and batteries.  When playing games, the slider is usually closed because the keyboard is not used. However, sometimes, when you need to quickly press the ESC key to return to the game settings interface, it is troublesome to slide it open every time. In order to improve the experience, we added 2 customizable physical keys on the back of WIN 3, in order to allow the user who needs extra keys to use them with the ""key binding customisation software” developed by GPD and built into the system to define a key on the keyboard.  When a user temporary lock the screen, it isn't convenient to slide up the screen in order to only enter Windows password. So we added a fingerprint sensor to unlock the device, in the bottom right corner of the device. Unleach the system with one touch!   To improve further the heat dissipation system, WIN 3 adopts large desktop PC grade turbofan + dual heat pipe heat dissipation solution, with PWM control. When the internal temperature is lower than 40℃, the fan only turns on at 20%. When the internal temperature is higher than 40℃, the fan accelerates with 2% PWM increments each time, up to 100%. The air outlets almost occupy the entire top case, and the 8-hole channel allows the device to quickly discard heat. TDP is set with three threshold, 15-18W, 18-22W, 22-28W. Users can enter BIOS to set the TDP of their choice.The top lid surface is sprayed in black matt and has curved edges, the middle is an 80×30mm hollow air inlet, and the handle part are made as a 5mm protruding design, which helps to avoid to block the air flow when it lays flat.  Tiger Lake-U in WIN 3 has a performance increase of 20% compared to Ice Lake-U of the previous generation, its graphics core performances has doubled and has 5 times the AI computing power of the previous generation. The following table is a comparison of the single-core/multi-core performance in Geekbench 5:  In terms of single-core performance comparison, i7-1195G7 surpasses desktop flagship processor i9-10900K; in terms of multi-core performance comparison, i7-1195G7 still beats desktop processor i5-10600.  WIN 3 integrates the 12th generation of Intel Iris Xe Graphics core, with 96 computing units, 8 cores per unit, for a total of 768 cores; its base frequency is 400MHz, the maximum dynamic frequency can reach up to 1300MHz, and it integrates 1MB L2 cache. The overall performances of the 96EU 1195G7 surpasses the NVIDIA GeForce MX350.The following table shows the performance of several mainstream mobile graphics cards under 3DMark 11 at a resolution of 1280×720:  Users know that the MX100-MX400 series launched by NVIDIA are unique mobile GPU, managing heavy tasks mainly for light and thin devices. One of the criteria for testing the performance of the graphic core is the floating-point computing capability test, which includes half-precision test (FP16), single-precision test (FP32), and double-precision test (FP64). Compared to Nvidia, how does the lightweight standalone Intel Iris Xe Graphics G7 96EU performs? The following table is a comparison of the four most powerful mobile graphics cards on the current market:  Intel Iris Xe Graphics G7 96EU surpasses NVIDIA GeForce MX450 (25W) in half-precision and single-precision floating-point operations and texture rate.  The Intel 11th-generation Tiger Lake-U processor increases the memory bandwidth to 86GB/s and supports the highest LPDDR4x 4267 memory to ensure the performance of the graphics core.After testing, we found that the memory write speed of WIN 3 (Intel Core i7-1195G7) is twice faster than the HP EliteBook 845 G7 (AMD Ryzen 7 4800U), although both products have built-in 16GB dual-channel LPDDR4x 4266 memory.We found that HP EliteBook 845 G7 will automatically reduce the frequency to LPDDR4 2666 MHz when the system is running. Looking at the Geekbench database, the comparison between i7-1195G7 and Ryzen 7 4700U shows that the memory bandwidth of the Intel processor is nearly 50% higher. Almost all ultrabooks based on AMD chipset are down-clocked to run at LPDDR4-2133 MHz to reduce latency.Obviously, AMD has made a compromise for the 15W APU, which is to reduce the memory frequency under certain conditions. After all, the CPU, GPU, DDR, and SSD are all drawing power, the lack of it can lead to a decrease of the frequency. Using Prime95 to test memory stability, it was founded that HP EliteBook 845 G7 would crash instantly.In a nutshell, we can draw as conclusion that AMD Ryzen 4000 series, with LPDDR4x 4266 memory, systematically has to run at a reduced frequency. Currently, LPDDR4x 4266 can only rely on the Intel 11th generation Tiger Lake-U processor to ensure the use of the 86GB/s memory bandwidth!The following table shows the memory benchmark tests done on LPDDR4 3200, LPDDR4x 3733, LPDDR4x 4266: * Scores are based on the read, write and copy, the corresponding products are all dual-channel devices.  In WIN 3’s built-in Intel 11th generation Tiger Lake-U processor, the biggest highlight is the integration of PCIe 4.0 interface specifications which offers a doubled bandwidth!Currently, the sequential read/write of SSD with mainstream M.2 NVMe protocol interface is about 2000 to 3000MB/s. However, this is not the flash memory speed limit. It is limited by the interface bandwidth of PCIe 3.0×4, and the theoretical throughput limit is 3.938GB/s. The theoretical throughput limit of PCIe 4.0 reaches 7.877GB/s. Therefore, when you use PCIe 4.0 SSD on WIN 3, its speed will be doubled.Tiger Lake-U series is currently the only embedded processor that can allows full access to the performance of PCIe 4 SSD. Meanwhile the competing AMD Ryzen 4000 series still only supports PCIe 3.0, Tiger Lake-Y only has a bus speed of 2GT/s OPI.The image below depicts the WIN 3 tested read/write performance with a built-in Samsung 980 Pro SSD (support PCIe 4.0), compared to several other products: * Test software: AS SSD Benchmark;* Test environment: 1135G7, LPDDR4x 4266, Samsung 980 PRO 500GB;* Different versions of AS SSD Benchmark test results are slightly different, and the heat dissipation will severely affect the read/write speed.* The chart shows read and write speed on PCIe 4 SSD. The standard configuration for the shipped machine is PCIe 3 SSD. If you want to ensure to reach the speed of the SSD in the chart, please purchase PCIe 4 SSD and swap it by yourself. It can be seen that the sequential read of Samsung 980 Pro 500GB exceeds 5000MB/s, the sequential write speed exceeds 3300MB/s, so the read speed does indeed exceeds USB4!  WIN 3 adopts M.2 NVMe / AHCI dual protocol interface, so no matter what kind of SSD you want to replace it with, it will work. However, due to space limit, WIN 3 only supports M.2 2280 single-side populated SSD, such as Samsung 980 PRO, while Lenovo NGFF SL700 can't be supported. Please focus on it when purchasing a new SSD.  Another WIN 3 highlight is the integration of the latest USB4 interface, which natively supports USB 4, USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 (20Gb/s), HDMI, DisplayPort, RJ-45 network port, audio port, charging and other interface protocols, with backward compatibility with USB interface specifications 3.2/3.1/3.0/2.0/1.1. USB4 can be considered as having a full set of integrated interfaces.The transfer rate of Ice Lake-U; the previous generation of Intel CPU; Thunderbolt 3 is 40Gbps, which includes one 8Gbps DisplayPort channel and four 8Gbps PCIe 3.0 channels. However, Thunderbolt 3 limits the maximum transfer rate supported by each connected device to 16Gbps (2GB/s). When you connect an external graphics dock, you can only use PCIe 3.0×2, and its bus DMI 3.0×4 can only provide 3.94GB/s bandwidth.The transfer rate of USB4 is still 40Gbps, but the PCIe 4.0 bandwidth is doubled, and the maximum transfer rate supported by each connected device is increased to 32Gbps (4GB/s). The bus DMI 3.0×4 doubles to DMI 3.0×8, which can provide a total bandwidth of about 7.86 GB/s. Thus, when playing games with USB4 external eGFX (graphics card docking station), the performance of the external graphics card will be fully utilized because the bus bandwidth is doubled.The Tiger Lake-Y series processors, although also integrated with USB4, can only provide 3.93GB/s bandwidth because the bus speed is only 2GT/s.Through the external graphics dock, whether using the main screen or an external monitor, the game frame rate is greatly increased. *Note: eGFX is a standard defined by Intel, which includes a complete set of external graphics solutions, such as power supply, motherboard, graphics card, interface, etc. The term eGPU only represents the graphics card. At present, retail platforms do not call eGFX uniformly. There are eGPU, graphics card dock, external graphicIn addition to external eGFX devices, the USB4 interface of WIN 3 supports power adapters based on PD 2.0/3.0 protocol and 15V/20V voltage, which is very scalable. For instance: 1. Any PD2.0/30 protocol power adapter with charging voltage up to 15V/20V on the market can charge WIN 3. 2. Through the USB4 interface, while outputting high-definition video signals to any monitor, the monitor can charge WIN 3 and as the reverse! 3. Through USB4 interface, WIN 3 supports the connection of 2 4K monitors or 1 8K monitor. 4. In the future, PCIe Gen 4 SSD external mobile hard disk or USB 4 flash disk can be connected to provide convenience for professional photographers to transfer large m2ts video files!  WIN 3 provides 65W PD 2.0 protocol fast charging, which can be used through the USB4 interface from Type C interface of the botton side of the device. The device is fully charge after about 1.5 hours, the battery life while playing heavy games can reach up to 2 to 3 hours, for a moderate use, around 6 to 8 hours, and for light use up to 11 hours.The following table depicts the comparison between charging performance on the WIN 3 and the one on the Microsoft Surface Pro 7: * Note on battery life testing:The test involves draining a fully charged battery during normal use, i.e., both active use and standby. The active parts include: (1) Web browsing test of accessing 8 mainstream websites through multiple open tabs(2) Using Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook for productivity testing(3) Applications on the device running for a period of time in an idle stateAll settings during the test are default values, except for the following settings: the screen brightness is set to 150 nits, and the automatic brightness adjustment is disabled; Wi-Fi stays connected. Battery life will vary significantly due to device settings, usage, and other factors. In addition to charging WIN 3, the standard 65W fast charge also supports charging for any mobile phone, tablet, and laptop with a USB Type-C interface, and that is compatible with PD protocol.  Although GPD WIN 2 previously crowdfunded on Indiegogo made up for the shortcomings of the first generation device, it has slightly insufficient performance, heat dissipation, appearance, and ergonomics. At the request of many WIN series users, we started to develop WIN 3 last year. The reason for launching crowdfunding on Indiegogo is mainly due to the high cost of WIN 3 research and development, mold and material procurement. All the funds we will raise will be invested in the mass production of this product. We believe that this product will touch all players who love handheld game consoles, and it will be the first choice for a PC gaming handheld console since a long time. We hope you will support this project. For games, let’s make achievement and progress together!  We are a company specialized in handheld game devices and office devices in Shenzhen, China. GPD is our brand, and its full name is GamePad Digital, which comes from the founder’s idea to make product for gamers. GPD is committed in providing users with well-customized products and services.  First, we would like to thank everyone that decided to support us by participating again in the crowdfunding campaign for our products. It is thanks to your contribution and continuous support that we can keep improve our devices. We also want to thanks all the new users who choose to support us for the first time in this large-scale crowdfunding. Without your trust and support, there would be no mass production and no new product launch.  1. Do the funds raised this time include shipping fees?The raised funds include international express freight and remote area surcharges, but do not include taxes incurred when entering the destination country. Generally, taxes of 21% will be incurred when entering EU countries; taxes of about 10% will be incurred when entering Japan; taxes of over $800 will be incurred when entering the United States; taxes in other countries may be higher. 2. What kind of after-sales service will users participating in crowdfunding receive?Crowdfunding users enjoy the same warranty rights as users who purchase the device when it is available in the retail market. If you are not satisfied with the device, you can return it within one week after you received it, but the original shipping cost paid by us in order to ship the device to you would be deducted from the refund.Please note aswell that the shipping and packaging costs incurred by the return will be at your expense. Please ship via the local postal express. Other international logistics will incur tariffs ranging from 20% to 30% of the value of the goods when entering China. GPD will not bear this part of the cost. 3. What if the crowdfunding fails to reach the target amount?If the crowdfunding fails to reach the target amount, we will issue a refund, and we will seek other means of financing to ensure the smooth progress of R&D and mass production. We hope that the users who loved our previous devices and love this handheld game console will continue to follow on the progress of our project. 4.

            The AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX Processor is the most powerful CPU in a mini-PC. With 8 cores and 16 threads, it ensures seamless multitasking and lag-free switching while you work.Upgradable RAM and SSD can enhance the speead of open, software loading, and files loading. The AMD Radeon™ / Vega 2100 MHz GPU with 8 Compute Units provides serious graphics processing power to easily handle the demands of complex design software, UHD video editing and playback, or light gaming. Based on advanced thermal modeling and simulation followed by real-world testing, we designed a professional-grade, pure copper heatsink equipped with dual heat pipes, and we selected high-thermal-conductivity (12W/mK) thermal compound to efficiently cool the system while preserving the small size. Combined with our new intelligent “tidal cooling system”and a large-diameter low-noise fan, the S500+ provides efficient thermal dissipation and intelligent fan speed control to allow for peak operation when you need it, and reduced noise and power consumption under normal use. Our system ensures the CPU temperature remains safe, resulting in a stable system without crashes or“blue screens of death” when your PC is working hard. Fan speed and power consumption profiles can be controlled from the BIOS, which allows for efficient heat management while maintaining excellent noise control.The S500+ provides a large array of connectivity and expandability options both inside and out.There are 6 “regular” USB ports (type-A), including two USB 3.2 Gen. 2 ports and four USB 2.0 ports to connect hard drives, scanners, cell phones, keyboards, and countless other peripherals.  One USB type-C port provides even more versatility:
USB 3.2 Gen. 2 data transfer at 10 Gbps
 Video output supports 4K 60Hz display
15W (5V @ 3A) USB power delivery / fast charging to quickly recharge your phone or power other peripherals, like a small monitor.
You can power the S500+ by USB-C instead of the AC adapter (requires a 20V5A USB-C  power supply, not included)
  Bluetooth 5.2 provides transmission distance up to 300 meters and speeds up to 2 Mbps. Dual high-speed Gigabit ports, supporting up to 2.5 Gbps, meet the needs of even the most demanding applications and users.Integrated Wi-Fi 6, powered by the Intel AX200 radio and 2x2 MU-MIMO antennas, allows up to 2.4 Gbps wireless transmission rate and includes technology to perform better in areas with other interfering networks. With Wi-Fi 6, you can enjoy faster and more stable wireless links anytime, anywhere.  Triple hard drive design: Dual M.2 2280 slots provide access to the highest-speed NVMe storage, and there’s additionally a built-in 2.5"" HDD bracket for mass storage using SATA.If you have really intense needs, or concerns about future needs, you can connect an external video card using an M.2-to-PCIe adapter (not included).S500+ With three video output interfaces—HDMI 2.0, DP 1.4, and USB type-C—you can drive three independent 4K 60Hz displays for extreme productivity. With the help of other adapters (not included), it’s even possible to connect more than three displays to improve your work efficiency, or you could use the HDMI 2.0 output with a 120Hz display.making the S500+ an excellent choice for POS, digital signage, kiosks, and surveillance monitoring. At just 149 x 145 x 40 mm, the ultra-compact size of the S500+ saves more space on your desk, making it perfect for any office or home.   To make sure everything keeps running smoothly even under the highest load, our 120-watt power adapter ensures the machine has a stable power supply. The high-quality, durable, and lightweight power supply will support your S500+ and anything you can do with or connect to it, like charging your phone, backing up your data to an external hard drive, and scanning documents at the same time.   The body is made of a high-strength, lightweight aluminum-magnesium alloy, making the S500+ sturdy but avoiding unnecessary weight. The top panel is designed with a wear-resistant mirror finish, which shows off the unique design and craftsmanship while preventing scratches. The S500+ works with Windows 10 and meets the requirements for the upcoming Windows 11 release, as well as Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and other recent Linux distributions.Our BIOS lets you set the CPU TDP and other parameters. However, nonexpert should be carefull using BIOS. With the flexibility to choose and use your own monitors and M.2 storage or peripherals, plug in half a dozen USB devices up to USB 3.2 Gen 2 and USB-C, connect to your 2.5 Gbps Ethernet LAN or Wi-Fi 6 network, and sync all your Bluetooth 5.2 or earlier peripherals, the MOREFINE S500+ with the AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX can do almost anything.If you’re interested in a better gaming experience, the S500+ will refuse lag and heat-induced slow-downs;  If you’re editing video, you’ll love that the smooth operation lets the machine get “out of the way” for you to maximize your creativity.  In the Office, the S500+ is your right-hand assistant, handling meetings easily, even with an HD webcam, Bluetooth 5.2 headset, and all the unique backgrounds or filters you desire, plus multiple 4K displays will keep all your spreadsheets, code, or other information just a glance away.  Specification Parameter Table

<p>In fact, there are several solutions for Linux to run Android apps already. But what JingPad &amp; JingOS wants to achieve is <strong>a seamless and unified experience to run Android apps and Linux apps</strong> without even recognizing what kind of app you are using. Android apps can run like native apps on JingPad with practically no performance loss since it's not a virtual machine or a container solution.</p>
</div></div><h3> </h3><h3>Apps Supporting the JingPad Keyboard (Trackpad-Keyboard)</h3><p>Most Linux apps are desktop apps, where the usage of keyboard and mouse is common. So we ran several Linux desktop apps on JingOS and recorded them in the videos below.

</ul><p> </p></div>","Meet JingPad A1Introducing JingPad A1, the world's first consumer-level Linux tablet, your new daily go-to tablet for Linux enthusiasts and consumers alike.
Flagship tablet built with industry-leading components and specs.
Powered by the next-generation Linux-based mobile OS: JingOS, which can both run Linux desktop apps and Android apps.

 JingPad A1 isn’t just a tablet; it’s also your new laptop!
Paired with our detachable keyboard with a built-in trackpad, JingPad A1 turns into a laptop in a snap.
Enjoy the power and freedom of a Linux-based OS. You can run most Linux apps on the go with the JingPad A1, including Terminal, GIMP, programming apps, etc.
With ""Android Apps on JingOS"" (AAJ), you can run most Android apps on JingPad A1. This makes the JingPad A1 the first Linux tablet which can also be used for your daily tasks.
 Media CoverageAfter JingOS was first released in Jan 2021, JingOS and JingPad have been covered by the global media. That's been achieved without any PR efforts from our side. JingOS and JingPad have obviously filled a blank in the Linux world!We are updating the press coverage here. JingPad A1 HardwareDesignFunctionality and design join hands to create an excellent hardware experience.We packaged the latest hardware components into a beautiful industrial design with a weight of only 490 grams. JingPad A1 comes with a high resolution 4:3 screen and a magnetically detachable keyboard to enhance desktop-like productivity. 

 
DisplayJingPad A1 brings a state-of-the-art 11″ AMOLED 2K+ 4:3 screen to the Linux world!The display has 2368 x 1728 physical pixels with a pixel density of 266 pixels per inch (PPI). The height of the upper and lower bezels is 7.55mm each, and the width of the left and right bezels is only 5.3mm. As a result, the outstanding screen-to-body ratio is almost 90%.The 4:3 format provides 20% more screen height compared to 16:10 screens. This is especially advantageous for working but also very convenient for entertainment.With a luminance of 350nit, the display looks great, even when used outdoors.The 100,000:1 ultra-high contrast ratio brings you a whole different color experience.Its NTSC 109% wide color gamut and the true color technology also make JingPad perfect for professional creative work.Finally, it is very eye-friendly due to low blue damage.  ChipTo guarantee a smooth and fluent user experience, the processor of the JingPad A1 is an Unisoc Tiger T7510. It is a powerful 12nm octa-core chipset with 4x Cortex-A75 cores clocked at 2.0GHz and 4x Cortex-A55 cores clocked at 1.8GHz. Due to the energy-efficient ARM architecture and an 8000mAh battery, the usage time is 8 to 10 hours, two times as long as typical laptops can do. Furthermore, it doesn't need a fan for cooling, which means that it is very silent.  RAM & StorageJingPad A1 comes with 8GB LPDDR4 RAM and 256GB UMCP storage. It also has an expandable memory and lets you insert a microSD card for up to 512GB of additional storage.  JingPad KeyboardJingPad Keyboard is an 11"" 6-rows keyboard with a full layout. It has a built‑in trackpad that gives you the full laptop experience with JingOS.The JingPad Keyboard has a floating cantilever design, allowing you to attach the JingPad A1 magnetically and smoothly adjust it to the perfect viewing angle (up to 135°).The JingPad Keyboard connects to and is powered by the JingPad via pogo pins, which is more stable than Bluetooth keyboards.The large 98.5mm x 45.0mm trackpad allows precise navigation. It supports multi‑touch gestures just like the Apple Magic Trackpad and shows a round cursor in JingOS.With the JingPad Keyboard, it is super easy to turn JingPad A1 from a tablet into a fully functional Linux laptop. You will see that you can use the JingPad without touching the screen when the trackpad is connected. JingPad Pencil - the StylusWe have made the first stylus with 4096 pressure levels in the Linux world. We call it JingPad Pencil.With JingPad Pencil, you can draw your ideas and sign your documents anytime, anywhere. It is easy to bring with you: Attach it to the magnetic area on the backside of the JingPad Keyboard.Experience creation at the tips of your fingers with MPP2.0 technology that allows for fewer delays and improved responsiveness.Charging the stylus battery to 100% only takes 2 hours, and you can use it for up to 360 hours. The two buttons on the JingPad pencil can be used for different functions, and you can customize them according to your preferences. What's in the Box? SpecsSpecs Comparison JingOS ARM on the JingPad A1JingOS UI and UXJingOS is designed to be a tablet OS and a laptop OS.We also developed several Linux apps specifically designed for JingOS.JingOS ARM on the JingPad A1 can run both Linux apps and Android apps. Users can download the apps in the official JingOS App Store. Both kinds of apps are executed side by side seamlessly and also the Android apps run virtually natively. Thus, you don't notice which kind of app you are using. Linux App CompatibilityMost people agree that the future belongs to ARM. But what about its compatibility with Linux?We have tested the most used Linux apps on the JingPad A1.Here is the report:We plan to launch a Hackathon to engage the community in porting more Linux apps to ARM and optimizing them for tablets. We are also making UI components for mobile Linux apps. So in the near future, you will be able to develop tablet apps for JingOS. Android App CompatibilityJingPad A1 will be able to run Android apps, but not 100% of them are compatible. We have a demo running an Android game on it (check the video below). Please follow our official forum (forum.jingos.com) for the dev updates.

In fact, there are several solutions for Linux to run Android apps already. But what JingPad & JingOS wants to achieve is a seamless and unified experience to run Android apps and Linux apps without even recognizing what kind of app you are using. Android apps can run like native apps on JingPad with practically no performance loss since it's not a virtual machine or a container solution.
 Apps Supporting the JingPad Keyboard (Trackpad-Keyboard)Most Linux apps are desktop apps, where the usage of keyboard and mouse is common. So we ran several Linux desktop apps on JingOS and recorded them in the videos below. Because the JingPad keyboard is not ready for a demo yet, we used a physical Bluetooth keyboard and mouse for the demo to control the apps.We will release a demo video with the JingPad Keyboard before July 14th. Using the JingPad Keyboard, you will enjoy a desktop-level experience on the JingPad A1.Join our official Discord/Telegram/Forum channels for the latest updates. Terminal DemoThunderBird Demo​Linux Games DemoVS Code Demo​LibreOffice Demo Apps Supporting the JingPad Pencil (Stylus)JingPad Pencil is essential for the convenient usage of some Linux and Android apps.

We have incorporated several safety features into Plybot. We have enclosed the hotend to prevent fingers from burns. We have hidden wires to prevent electric shocks. We have architected joints to prevent any pinching.</p><p> </p><h3>Works with many filament types</h3><p>Although the majority of our users are likely to use PLA, Plybot can handle a wide range of filament types.  Here is a selection of the filament types you may wish to use on your Plybot:</p><p><strong>PLA, ABS, PETG, PETT, ASA, Polypropylene, TPE, PCTPE, Soft PLA, Semi-flexible TPU, Laybrick, Wood, Carbon, Proto pasta.</strong></p><p> </p><h3>We don't restrict you.

Please join us on our journey. Latest Q&A VIDEOPlease check out our updates -- we post regularly.  Below is the latest Q&A session with Brook Drumm. Featured in   Plybot has arms which allow it to print on 60% of its footprint.Plybot’s arms are one-of-a-kind, and aren’t just for show! Aside from looking human, the vastly simplified arm design allows it to print bigger, faster, and more reliably. Range of motion - demoWe created a small video to show the range of the movement on the Plybot arms.   Plybot is almost silent. 3D printing no longer distracts.Anyone who has experience with 3D printers knows just how loud they can be - we are changing that. By utilizing the latest advancements in motor drivers, we specifically designed Plybot to deliver the most soundless experience possible. The result? A near-silent 3D printer. Simply click & print objects from our App.Plybot has its very own app, available on iOS and Android. Use it to control your Plybot, find objects to print, and order new filament and accessories for your machine. If you want to use your own software, we won't restrict you, but for those of you that just want something that works out of the box - One-Click printing is finally here! Connect via WIFI, USB, SD CardPlybot allows you to connect in many ways. Connect over Wifi, USB or SD Card.  However you want to work, Plybot works for you. Plybot removes complexityPlybot is smarter than most 3D printers. With auto-leveling, fans that manage the temperature, sensors that control the flow of filament, and much more. Plybot simply works and takes away the complexity often associated with 3D printing. Plybot is safe for people of all ages.It is important that Plybot is the safest as well as the easiest to use 3D printers. We have incorporated several safety features into Plybot. We have enclosed the hotend to prevent fingers from burns. We have hidden wires to prevent electric shocks. We have architected joints to prevent any pinching. Works with many filament typesAlthough the majority of our users are likely to use PLA, Plybot can handle a wide range of filament types.  Here is a selection of the filament types you may wish to use on your Plybot:PLA, ABS, PETG, PETT, ASA, Polypropylene, TPE, PCTPE, Soft PLA, Semi-flexible TPU, Laybrick, Wood, Carbon, Proto pasta. We don't restrict you. Your software, your filaments. You don't have to use our software to control your Plybot. You don't have to use our filaments. We've not used secret tools to prevent you from opening the Plybot up.  So if you want that level of control Plybot will work for you.   Beautiful inside

 Made in the USA .This is incredibly important to us.  We have invested heavily to ensure that we can produce our Plybot 3D Printer (and accessories) here in the US, and in most cases in-house. PerksMatte Black Plybot 3D printer + 1KG of filament.Everything you need to be printing in minutes  Founding team Brook Drumm (Right). 3D printing guru. Founder of Printrbot. Former co-host of US series 'All American Makers'. Josh Mitchell (Middle). 3d printer visionary.  UK Young Engineer of the Year. Stanford University undergraduate. Ian Wilding (Left). Founder of Hangar 75, responsible for pulling it all together. BackstoryThe story starts with Josh Mitchell. In 2018, at the age of 18, Josh won UK Young Engineer of the Year for his first iteration of the Plybot 3D printer. He focused on creating a low cost, high quality, flat-packed 3D printer—made of Plywood—uniquely his printer had 'arms' which had a mesmerizing effect when building up the objects.This is Josh receiving his award, and showing his initial version of the machine: Shortly after winning this award Josh moved to California, taking his new home at Stanford University.In 2019, Brook Drumm joined Plybot.

<p>Grade 5 Titanium alloy will ensure that it can withstand the elements. Titanium is highly prized for its strength, lightweight, and corrosion resistance. It’s one of the most corrosion-resistant metals, so it won’t rust or oxidize. Therefore titanium does not have to be coated or anodized like aluminum and steel, so there is no surface coating that can be scratched off. What you see is naked titanium in all its glory.</p>

<p>I’ve never mastered the art of removing a permanent marker cap with only one hand. Have you? It’s so annoying to have to set down the object to be marked in order to use both hands to remove the marker cap, place it on the top of the marker, and then write, only to have to repeat the same steps in reverse when finished. BAM! problem solved!</p>

<p>The perfect weight, the ideal size, the premium titanium, and the smooth motion of the slide make using the marker a super satisfying experience. The release was specially designed with a shallow detent to keep it securely in place and requires only a simple flick to the side to retract.</p>

<p>The clip will come to rest in a shallow groove. When you’re done marking, simply push on the clip to the right, and it will release and the marker will retract.</p>
<p>Tired of pens where the clip becomes loose and jiggles around? I designed the clip such that it won't wiggle, and the screws won't become loose. The base of the clip fits tightly into a pocket in the slide. The screws provide the clamping force to keep the clip base in the pocket. It's solid and I've tested the durability by using it as part of my EDC.</p>

<p>Titanium has such a beautiful natural dark silver color and the best way to present it is with a matte finish. This finish is extremely low maintenance and looks better and better as it ages and gets used. It is scratch-resistant, but life happens, and if it does get scratched, the appearance is easy to bring back to new using a scotch-brite pad.</p>

<p>What do you reach for when you want to leave a permanent mark? Your favorite Sharpie® brand permanent marker! That’s why I’m including only the best, <span><span>genuine</span></span><span> Fine Tip Sharpie® brand retractable</span> <span>refill</span> <span>cartridge</span> with the Marksmith titanium pen body<span>.</span> The fine point tip is the standard and most commonly used size that you are familiar with. You can draw fine lines with it by just using the tip, or broad strokes by angling it and using the wide edge.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span>Won’t Dry Out</span></h2>
<p>The cartridge has a tiny trap door that covers the tip of the marker when retracted and will prevent it from drying out. It’s a lot easier than hunting for the lost cap. Since the trap door is part of the cartridge, the mechanism is refreshed every time the cartridge is replaced, so you won't have to worry about this wearing out.</p>

<p>The Marksmith is refillable. The cartridges can be easily replaced by unscrewing the tip and exchanging the old cartridge with a new one.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Want to add more cartridges to your pledge?</h1>
<p>We'll be using Backerkit to collect your shipping address after the campaign has ended. During the Backerkit checkout process, you'll be able to add extra cartridges to your order.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Where to Buy Replacement Cartridges?</h1>
<p><span>Marksmith will ship with 2 cartridges.</span> Additional cartridges will be available as add ons in the Backerkit survey after the Kickstarter ends. </p>
<p><span><strong>OPTION 1:</strong> When you use up both of your included cartridges, you will be able to buy the refills for your Marksmith from us. </span>Replacement cartridges will be available to purchase from our website and online retailers like Amazon.</p>
<p><strong><span>OPTION 2:</span></strong> <span>I highly recommend buying the cartridge from us for proper fit and to reduce waste. </span>However, I know that some of you like to do everything yourselves (myself included) so I will explain how you can refill the Marksmith if you choose not to buy the replacement cartridges from us. The cartridge is the same used in the plastic Sharpie retractable fine point marker, but we make a modification to it to fit the Marksmith BAM!. If you're feeling adventurous you can disassemble a Sharpie retractable marker, snip off the long tail to make it shorter and insert that into your Marksmith.</p>
<p><span><strong>OPTION 3: </strong>I'm investigating a 3rd option that will allow you to refill the cartridge using readily available permanent marker ink,</span> like <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006OM39Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PILOT Super Color Permanent Marker Refill Ink</a>. This will be a more eco-friendly refill method as you can continue to refill the cartridge until the felt tip is worn out. One bottle of ink will likely last a very long time.</p>

<p>Many have asked if the Marksmith is lefty friendly. Even though I am right-handed, I have no problems using the Marksmith with my left hand. Tatiane is left-handed and she approves of it being easy to use. Unlike pens that have a separate clip and bolt which are primarily designed around right-handed use, the Marksmith's integrated clip/bolt design allows it to be used ambidextrously.</p>

<h1>The Back Story</h1>
<p>As an engineer, designer, and maker, I do a lot of hands-on work and have to make marks on a variety of materials. The standard Sharpie marker is my instrument of choice, whether I'm marking cut lines on wood, sketching designs, or labeling containers in the shop. Plastic Sharpie and other permanent markers are inexpensive, but I always thought that a metal, retractable marker would be so much nicer to use and carry. </p>
<p>A major inspiration behind the concept and name is my friend Mark McJunkin. He was the first person I've met who used a Sharpie marker for everything. In a pinch, he might even use them as chopsticks to eat. As an industrial designer, he sketched all the time and all of his sketches were in Sharpie. Initially, it annoyed me when he would write on notebook paper with a Sharpie because the writing took up more space than had he used a pen. Over time I grew to appreciate that this was his way and it was efficient because he was using one tool for multiple purposes. The marker enabled him to quickly layout designs, and he would sketch on large rolls of paper so that the design timeline could be traced in a linear progression of evolution.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>From Concept to Reality</h1>
<p>These are some of the steps that we've taken to bring the Marksmith to reality. It all begins with an idea, which in this case has been on my mind for years. Once the light bulb moment occurs, I move to start designing the marker in CAD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588573059/du1bjv32gr3jlqpgin8s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Once the CAD is fleshed out, then it's time to start 3D printing some models to see how they function in real life. Previously I used FDM 3D printers, and the quality for small parts like this was not very good. Now I have some resin 3D printers that have exceptional quality and fine detail. It makes it very rapid to iterate the design.</p>
<div data-caption=""3D printed resin prototypes"" data-id=""28346453""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588573108/uei8v0izzamitnedxr6w.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>I go through many revisions using the resin 3D printed models, making improvements each time until I'm finally satisfied with the marker design and function. The 3D printed resin models may look like the real thing, but they are not strong. Now it's time to make it real by CNC machining it out of Titanium.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588573138/rdb8ugvywsofkhuycbaj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Aluminum is much softer and easier to machine than Titanium. Titanium becomes hard when bent (and there's a lot of bending when cutting chips of metal), so it generates a lot of heat and resists cutting. The first prototype parts are made out of aluminum to test the CNC program and the part appearance.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Once we're satisfied with the design and have worked out the bugs in the CNC program, we move onto re-machining the parts out of titanium.</p>
<p>Getting the perfect profile on the tips was probably the most challenging aspect. I went through several revisions to make the tip look amazing while staying as slim as possible.</p>

Click here to get your Marksmith now! Digital devices may have replaced pens for daily writing tasks, but there’s one thing that still can’t be done with a computer or smartphone… Permanently write on any object. (Like marking your name on the energy drink in the office fridge so Bret doesn’t down it.) While there are many options for stylish and durable pens that I would be proud to carry… There are ZERO options for a retractable permanent marker that meets my high standards, until... I set out to design and make the world's first all-metal (Titanium), retractable, permanent marker...  
 MARKSMITH /märkˌsmiTH/ noun: a skilled user of markers.There are several inspirations for the name Marksmith. A wordsmith is defined as ""a skilled user of words"". A smith is a ""worker in metal"", which is perfect since the Marksmith is crafted from metal. And you may think that Mark comes from ""marker"", and it does, but really it's a shout out to my good friend Mark McJunkin who is a beast-mode designer/maker, a prolific user of Sharpie markers and inspiration for this permanent marker pen. Hitting your Mark is also a term that invokes high accuracy, and a Marksman is a person skilled at hitting their mark, which ties into the bolt action mechanism. So all of this comes together to form a new word MARKSMITH: ""a skilled user of markers"".BAM! /bam!/ acronym: Bolt Action Marker!Not only does BAM! stand for Bolt Action Marker, but it's also what I feel like saying every time I extend or retract the Marksmith. From here on out, I'll be using BAM! in place of bolt action marker.  

 

 

 First and foremost, Marksmith is a super-strong titanium pen body that is compatible with a genuine Sharpie® brand retractable permanent marker cartridge, which means you can write on almost anything. The felt-tip is the most common and useful general-purpose size, ""fine"", and the ink is black. It is not the ultra-fine tip that has a tip more like a pen.   In addition to being able to mark on any surface, Marksmith is the perfect companion for drawing and sketching on paper too. Thin(ish) lines can be drawn using the fine point, or broad lines if you use the wide edge. I use the Marksmith to make wide, dark lines to highlight engineering design sketches.  

 

 
We CNC ""Computer Numerical  ̶C̶o̶n̶t̶r̶o̶l̶  Crafted” machine the Marksmith out of Grade 5 Titanium alloy. It’s precisely designed to go where no permanent marker has gone before.
 

 
Grade 5 Titanium alloy will ensure that it can withstand the elements. Titanium is highly prized for its strength, lightweight, and corrosion resistance. It’s one of the most corrosion-resistant metals, so it won’t rust or oxidize. Therefore titanium does not have to be coated or anodized like aluminum and steel, so there is no surface coating that can be scratched off. What you see is naked titanium in all its glory.

Goto the ""From Concept to Reality"" section at the bottom of the page to see more about the process of taking this marker from concept through prototype to production.

 
The bolt action is inspired by the mechanism used in rifles. This superior method of extension and retraction provides an elegant and secure mechanical lock without parts that will wear out or break.
 

 
It’s also extremely fun to fidget with. You won’t be able to put it down.
 

 
I’ve modified the bolt motion so that it securely locks in place and requires only a push to the side to release and retract.
 

 

 

 

 
I’ve never mastered the art of removing a permanent marker cap with only one hand. Have you? It’s so annoying to have to set down the object to be marked in order to use both hands to remove the marker cap, place it on the top of the marker, and then write, only to have to repeat the same steps in reverse when finished. BAM! problem solved!
 

 

 
The perfect weight, the ideal size, the premium titanium, and the smooth motion of the slide make using the marker a super satisfying experience. The release was specially designed with a shallow detent to keep it securely in place and requires only a simple flick to the side to retract.
 

 

 
The bolt action is fun to fidget with! With a nice weight and balance, the marker is also excellent for flipping between your fingers.
 

 

 
The clip is beautifully designed and it’s so much more than just a clip. It is integral to the operation of the marker.

 
The top of the clip is perfectly angled for your thumb and has 3 non-slip grooves that also offer tactile feedback.
 

 
With your thumb on this intentionally designed area, pushing the clip down and to the left will extend and lock the marker.
 

 
The clip will come to rest in a shallow groove. When you’re done marking, simply push on the clip to the right, and it will release and the marker will retract.
Tired of pens where the clip becomes loose and jiggles around? I designed the clip such that it won't wiggle, and the screws won't become loose. The base of the clip fits tightly into a pocket in the slide. The screws provide the clamping force to keep the clip base in the pocket. It's solid and I've tested the durability by using it as part of my EDC.
 

 
The smooth exterior surface, rounded edges, and precision chamfered clip make the Marksmith super comfortable to carry in your pocket. There's nothing sharp to poke you, and it won't scratch the f$!@# out of your hand when you reach into your pocket. Your hand will slide right past like butter.
 

 

 
Titanium has such a beautiful natural dark silver color and the best way to present it is with a matte finish. This finish is extremely low maintenance and looks better and better as it ages and gets used. It is scratch-resistant, but life happens, and if it does get scratched, the appearance is easy to bring back to new using a scotch-brite pad.
 

 

 
What do you reach for when you want to leave a permanent mark? Your favorite Sharpie® brand permanent marker! That’s why I’m including only the best, genuine Fine Tip Sharpie® brand retractable refill cartridge with the Marksmith titanium pen body. The fine point tip is the standard and most commonly used size that you are familiar with. You can draw fine lines with it by just using the tip, or broad strokes by angling it and using the wide edge.
 
Won’t Dry Out
The cartridge has a tiny trap door that covers the tip of the marker when retracted and will prevent it from drying out. It’s a lot easier than hunting for the lost cap. Since the trap door is part of the cartridge, the mechanism is refreshed every time the cartridge is replaced, so you won't have to worry about this wearing out.
 

 

 
The Marksmith is refillable. The cartridges can be easily replaced by unscrewing the tip and exchanging the old cartridge with a new one.
 
Want to add more cartridges to your pledge?
We'll be using Backerkit to collect your shipping address after the campaign has ended. During the Backerkit checkout process, you'll be able to add extra cartridges to your order.
 
Where to Buy Replacement Cartridges?
Marksmith will ship with 2 cartridges. Additional cartridges will be available as add ons in the Backerkit survey after the Kickstarter ends. 
OPTION 1: When you use up both of your included cartridges, you will be able to buy the refills for your Marksmith from us. Replacement cartridges will be available to purchase from our website and online retailers like Amazon.
OPTION 2: I highly recommend buying the cartridge from us for proper fit and to reduce waste. However, I know that some of you like to do everything yourselves (myself included) so I will explain how you can refill the Marksmith if you choose not to buy the replacement cartridges from us. The cartridge is the same used in the plastic Sharpie retractable fine point marker, but we make a modification to it to fit the Marksmith BAM!. If you're feeling adventurous you can disassemble a Sharpie retractable marker, snip off the long tail to make it shorter and insert that into your Marksmith.
OPTION 3: I'm investigating a 3rd option that will allow you to refill the cartridge using readily available permanent marker ink, like PILOT Super Color Permanent Marker Refill Ink. This will be a more eco-friendly refill method as you can continue to refill the cartridge until the felt tip is worn out. One bottle of ink will likely last a very long time.
 

 
Many have asked if the Marksmith is lefty friendly. Even though I am right-handed, I have no problems using the Marksmith with my left hand. Tatiane is left-handed and she approves of it being easy to use. Unlike pens that have a separate clip and bolt which are primarily designed around right-handed use, the Marksmith's integrated clip/bolt design allows it to be used ambidextrously.

 

 
I stand behind all my products because we are passionate about designing only the best. We've spent months on the design, prototype, construction, and have been carrying it every day to test the durability in real-life situations. The Marksmith carries a lifetime warranty of the all-metal body. The warranty does not cover the cartridge since it is a replaceable, disposable item.

The Back Story
As an engineer, designer, and maker, I do a lot of hands-on work and have to make marks on a variety of materials. The standard Sharpie marker is my instrument of choice, whether I'm marking cut lines on wood, sketching designs, or labeling containers in the shop. Plastic Sharpie and other permanent markers are inexpensive, but I always thought that a metal, retractable marker would be so much nicer to use and carry. 
A major inspiration behind the concept and name is my friend Mark McJunkin. He was the first person I've met who used a Sharpie marker for everything. In a pinch, he might even use them as chopsticks to eat. As an industrial designer, he sketched all the time and all of his sketches were in Sharpie. Initially, it annoyed me when he would write on notebook paper with a Sharpie because the writing took up more space than had he used a pen. Over time I grew to appreciate that this was his way and it was efficient because he was using one tool for multiple purposes. The marker enabled him to quickly layout designs, and he would sketch on large rolls of paper so that the design timeline could be traced in a linear progression of evolution.
 
From Concept to Reality
These are some of the steps that we've taken to bring the Marksmith to reality. It all begins with an idea, which in this case has been on my mind for years. Once the light bulb moment occurs, I move to start designing the marker in CAD.
 

Marksmith CAD model with hidden lines visible
 
Once the CAD is fleshed out, then it's time to start 3D printing some models to see how they function in real life. Previously I used FDM 3D printers, and the quality for small parts like this was not very good. Now I have some resin 3D printers that have exceptional quality and fine detail. It makes it very rapid to iterate the design.
 

3D printed resin prototypes
 
I go through many revisions using the resin 3D printed models, making improvements each time until I'm finally satisfied with the marker design and function. The 3D printed resin models may look like the real thing, but they are not strong. Now it's time to make it real by CNC machining it out of Titanium.
 

1st operation CNC machining the titanium clip
 
Aluminum is much softer and easier to machine than Titanium. Titanium becomes hard when bent (and there's a lot of bending when cutting chips of metal), so it generates a lot of heat and resists cutting. The first prototype parts are made out of aluminum to test the CNC program and the part appearance.

CNC turning the marker tip profile
 
Once we're satisfied with the design and have worked out the bugs in the CNC program, we move onto re-machining the parts out of titanium.
Getting the perfect profile on the tips was probably the most challenging aspect. I went through several revisions to make the tip look amazing while staying as slim as possible.
 
Titanium marker tips in different stages of machining
 
The body is turned on the CNC lathe first. Then it is mounted in the 4th axis rotary table on the CNC mill so that it can be turned while machining.

Once all the parts are finished machining, it's time to put on the finishing touches.
 

 
The Marksmith BAM! is designed by Daniel Bauen, owner of the product design firm Engineerable LLC located in Atlanta, GA. Marksmith BAM! is the first product released under the BAUEN MADE brand, because I’m especially proud of this design. BAUEN translates as “to build” from german. As an engineer and designer, this is the perfect last name.

Isolate only important things in your own sight. Jot down on Mover Erase Combo, think, feel, rearrange, break down into small tasks and focus on action. Use your hands to turn on your head.   so what's new During our 2nd campaign, ""Mover Erase - Mini Whiteboard on the Palm"", our community asked for an upgrade of the 1st gen Mover with Erasable surface. This campaign is the upgrade of 1st campaign tools injected with the eco-friendly ideology from the 2nd campaign. The process involves the experience of manufacturing a new found material from the second campaign and applying it to change and upgrade the 1st gen Movers. it looks like a small change, though it is a response to the voice of the community.   In our first campaign, the sizes of Mover were praised by backers. They believe those are the perfect sizes for breaking ideas down and blocking the time. Arranging works could be more meticulous and it would be easy to separate different ideas.Although writing on memo paper still has its value, some backers felt that refilling mover was a shortcoming as the product was still in early stages. They worry refills are not immediately available. Erasable surface was needed.For our second campaign, we originally would like to turn all 1st gen product erasable. However, mass producing small sizes of silicon material was a challenge. New installation method has to be tested and discovered. That is why the size in the second campaign is much larger than the first campaign and only comes in a single size.Small sizes of silicon mass production Failure during initial second campaign planning.After the 2nd campaign’s success. We have accumulated the manufacturing experience and mastered it. In this campaign. we have utter confidence to apply new found material to complete the product development process in response to the backers in the 2nd campaign. Also, there has been an improvement for the coating technique based on the 2nd campaign’s writing material to produce the 3rd campaign’s rewards.The improvement of coating technique enhances the erasable experience and solve the stain problem. The silicon whiteboard material’s stability and polymerization is enhanced.  We have not settled for simply turning the 1st gen Movers into erasable surfaces, we have taken an extra step. To embody the idea of “using Mover Erase everywhere”, we have invited a new organizer to the family, The MoverPanel.MoverPanel is a light weight, versatile organizer with magnetic feature which can store Mover Erase Combo. At the same time, its back is embedded with micro-suction technology with silicon, thus making it rewashable and re-stickable.The Components of Mover PanelExtra Thin Matt Black Metallic Sheet InstallationTemplate changing featureMover Erase Combo snapped on Mover PanelWashable silicon adhesive surface  For our 1st campaign, there wasn’t any voting or involvment of color design for Movers. For the 2nd campaign, the color was set to only White by default.In this campaign, there will be 2 extra colors on top of “white” right off the bat. Those two colors were the 2 favoritely voted colors from the last campaign. After stretch goals are met, we are excited welcome more colors to the Mover family!We can’t wait for more ideas from the community, whether they are on templates, advancement of usage, new organizers need. etc.   1 pack has 1 single color. Organizers:Different organizers for Mover Erase Combo can suit different needs.Backers can add the organizers they want during the backer survey period, which will be sent after pledging on Indiegogo.   Stick ideas on the wall with Mover PanelMover Panel on GlassSticking Mover Panel anywhereSilicon material for washing and re-stickingMover Panel change of templates Snap ideas aside monitor for always-in-sight reminder.Easy adjustment for sudden change of agendaMoverPad Template Changing FeatureSnap MoverPad on the Fridge.  A central thinking place for ideas!Magnetic snap on Fridge/ Whiteboard!Template Changing!

It needs fewer passes to cut deeper than other engravers/ cutters in its class, so the resulting kerf is barely larger than the laser beam itself. This makes it possible to make very fine details and leaves less burn on the surface.</p><p> </p><div data-caption=""Engraving &amp; Cutting Details "" data-id=""33425655""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/425/655/d6380f33381c0e02548fb69fe776c683_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1620383233&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;q=92&amp;s=dd0837303dc636efc82b55b6eb999a39"" src=""""/><figcaption><p> </p>

Last year, with your help, we launched the Wainlux K6 – the first compact, powerful, and simple-to-use laser engraver. The Kickstarter campaign was a great success and helped us reach users all over the world.By sharing the K6 with so many creative people, we learned a great deal about the features most important to users. Your valuable feedback and suggestions helped guide the development of our latest product – Wainlux L3, the perfect outlet for your creativity.Small at-home laser machines are not powerful enough to produce your favorite patterns while heavier machines often cost a fortune. You need a slimmed-down industrial laser cutter & engraver, yet with industrial power! Wainlux L3 helps you realize your creative potential at the touch of a button. 
  Direct Metal Engraving Without Darkening
Engraving on metal is impossible for most laser engravers. But not for Wainlux L3. With twin beams laser + FAC optic, the laser spot is strong enough to engrave on unprepared metal.  
 
  With Wainlux L3, your creative designs come to life thanks to its powerful 10W twin-beam laser. Its versatility is endless – create home decor, gifts for friends, 3D toys, or small businesses you are planning to start in 2021. Anything...as much as you can imagine! 
 The Wainlux L3 uses a compressed laser dot of 10W that is powerful enough to cut through a 5mm board in only one pass. It needs fewer passes to cut deeper than other engravers/ cutters in its class, so the resulting kerf is barely larger than the laser beam itself. This makes it possible to make very fine details and leaves less burn on the surface.  
  The body of the L3 is an aluminum structure that is durable and rigid. Left and right linear guide rails ensure the laser head moves synchronously along the x-axis, this means that intricately detailed designs can be reproduced reliably over and over again with perfect accuracy.   Fast Set-UpWainlux L3 has an innovative design that is delivered in pre-assembled modules so it only takes 2 minutes to put them together and begin engraving.
 

 
Live PreviewBefore you start a masterpiece with L3, you can set it through your mobile or PC on ‘‘Preview Mode’’. There will be a light spot on the object surface moving with the laser head, outlining the size and position of the pattern selected, then the placement can be adjusted as desired. 
 Autofocus by Distance SensorIt’s frustrating to find ugly burn marks on your work because of lasers that fail to focus. But manually setting the laser focus can be difficult on irregular objects so L3 is designed with an Autofocus feature that finds the ‘sweet spot’ every time. With a simple tap on the touch key on the laser head, it automatically z-downs and stops at the pre-programmed focus distance. Then all you need to do is watch as your design appears on the surface. 

   Batch ProductionThe extended working area of L3 is suitable for engraving larger patterns and also very handy for batch creation-- engraving or cutting several objects at one time without resetting the machine again.     Heightening Spacer  Make it possible to engrave on a big volume object with 4 heightening columns, less limitation on size, more options to engrave on.  Rotary Roller Cylindrical objects, orbs, even eggs can be engraved on with the rotary roller. 360° engraving is possible for Wainlux L3. Break the rule of conventional engraving, Wainlux L3 brings you more fun engraving on uneven surfaces! 
  We created L3 by downsizing the high quality and powerful features found in industrial laser cutters & engravers. Wainlux L3 uses a pioneering design that integrates double laser diodes into one head. The converging power beams go through a FAC optic, which compresses the laser into an 80 um spot with output efficiency high up to 97.5%! L3 Twin Beams + FAC L3 Laser spot diameter vs Other’s L3 Laser Kerfs vs Other’s  These powerful functions of Wainlux L3 are not to be offered at the cost of your safety. Advanced safeguard gives all-round protections that ensure safety for the device and its users.    Review Video By Marco Reps

 
We have been working on our new software and it will be compatible with all of the products from Wainlux (K4 excepted). With cross-platform compatibility for both mobile and desktop use, more intuitive UI design and versatile multi-format support, Wainlux L3 is easier to use for anyone. In addition, Lightburn and LaserGRBL are also compatible with Wainlux L3 after the firmware upgrade.
