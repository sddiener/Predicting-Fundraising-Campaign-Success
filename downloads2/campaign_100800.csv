  The stretcher, designed to last thousands of opening and closing cycles, is made of a single piece of flexible material with integrated joints.  Unlike traditional umbrellas, which are made up of a multitude of pins and rigid rods that break easily, our particular patented geometry allows it to flex elastically, avoiding deformation and damage.  The number of components has been considerably reduced, from over 130 in traditional umbrellas to just 24 in Pluvi. The assembly has been simplified by replacing the traditional screws and hinges with long-lasting snap-fit, increasing the overall reliability of the umbrella. 
  The handle and the shaft have been designed to take full advantage of the high flexibility of the whole umbrella when it is subjected to wind stress.  The canvas, made with a high density micro fiber Pongee 210T fabric, ensures a high degree of water repellency that allows water droplets to quickly slip away and performs an important protective function by shielding 95% of UVA and UVB rays. 
 
 We compared Pluvi, in terms of Durability and Flexibility, with traditional umbrellas of the same Price Range.  
 Few components to minimize the chances of failure and all produced by the same injection moulding technology. Our unique technical polymer, used for every single element of the umbrella, has been specifically developed to be easily recovered and reused for the manufacturing of new products.  Perfectly suitable for a complete cradle-to-cradle system or an alternate version made from zero-impact biodegradable polymers. 
 Pluvi is an umbrella with a modern look and attractive colors, combining sustainability with Italian style.  For those who are looking for something practical and stylish or simply as a useful original gift.

Don't leave home without it. Seat Belt Cutter: easily slice through a seat belt to escape in an emergency  Window Breaker: quickly smash out a window to escape a disasterMojica had too much fun field testing this. The owners of Littleton, CO U-Pull Automotive Recycling center were awesome (we owe them a couple of fire escapes).  Fire Starter: light your camp stove or campfire quickly with the EverSpark fire wheel. It is the same tried and true technology we use on the firebiner® so you know it will work every time with ease.  Accessory Kit: always have a dry piece of tinder with you by carrying a TinderQuik in your Wombat Whistle attached to your Fire Escape.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">The idea of the transformable 3in1 bag was to get a versatile travel bag. We took care of you that one bag replaced the three most popular bags that travellers usually use.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Three bags take up more space, carry more weight and create additional inconvenience. Thanks to the transformation mechanism, you use the bag and change its size when you need it in a variety of situations.</p>

<h2>Transformation mechanism</h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">When you arrive at your destination, you simply lay out things from a travel bag and, thanks to one zipper, make a laptop size from a travel size and use it. Either you fold it again and make a small bag for walking and use it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://trinus-style.com/images/indigogo/3in1zip.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Things packing</h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Access to things from two sides. You can pack your things from the side like into a suitcase with a side zipper and add things to your bag with a top zipper.</p>

<h2>Laptop pocket</h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Separate pocket for the laptop diagonal up to 15 inches. Thanks to the soft pockets from the one side and a large compartment with things from the other, your laptop has additional protection against mechanical stress. When checking in at the airport you do not have to get a laptop, just open a separate pocket.</p>

<h2>Laptop size</h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Upon arrival, you just need to put the clothes and things out of the bag without taking out the laptop. Fold it into the laptop size and your laptop will be with you. Now you do not need to take one more bag on the road. Laptop size is great for going to work or study. But at any time and in any place, you can quickly turn it into a travel or crossbody bag.</p>

<h2>Crossbody size</h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The travel bag or laptop bag can always be reduced to the size of a small handbag for walking (small cross body bag). You can always put the most necessary things like the mobile phone, passport, wallet and so on.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Having a bag of only 1.5 liters on your shoulder, you can easily increase the volume to 38 liters in seconds.</p>

The idea of the transformable 3in1 bag was to get a versatile travel bag. We took care of you that one bag replaced the three most popular bags that travellers usually use.
Three bags take up more space, carry more weight and create additional inconvenience. Thanks to the transformation mechanism, you use the bag and change its size when you need it in a variety of situations.
 






Travel size
Going on a trip, use all the advantages of the travel size.

The bag can be packed by the following items:

Transformation mechanism
When you arrive at your destination, you simply lay out things from a travel bag and, thanks to one zipper, make a laptop size from a travel size and use it. Either you fold it again and make a small bag for walking and use it.

Things packing
Access to things from two sides. You can pack your things from the side like into a suitcase with a side zipper and add things to your bag with a top zipper.


Removable bottom
The removable bottom serves to stiffen the bag, when folded it fits for the side pocket.

Mesh divider
Divides the bag into two sections: the main and additional. In the additional section, you can put on clothes that you may urgently need on the road, such as a light jacket or pullover.

Luggage strap for the travel size of the bag
If you travel with a roller suitcase you can easily fasten the Trinus bag on the handle for easy movement.


Carry-on size
Avoid baggage fees when you check and keep your bag with you when you explore. Trinus bag meets domestic and international carry-on standards.


Laptop pocket
Separate pocket for the laptop diagonal up to 15 inches. Thanks to the soft pockets from the one side and a large compartment with things from the other, your laptop has additional protection against mechanical stress. When checking in at the airport you do not have to get a laptop, just open a separate pocket.

Laptop size
Upon arrival, you just need to put the clothes and things out of the bag without taking out the laptop. Fold it into the laptop size and your laptop will be with you. Now you do not need to take one more bag on the road. Laptop size is great for going to work or study. But at any time and in any place, you can quickly turn it into a travel or crossbody bag.


Luggage strap for the laptop size of the bag
For a laptop size, it is also possible to fasten a bag on a suitcase, which will allow you to free your hands.


Crossbody size
The travel bag or laptop bag can always be reduced to the size of a small handbag for walking (small cross body bag). You can always put the most necessary things like the mobile phone, passport, wallet and so on.
Having a bag of only 1.5 liters on your shoulder, you can easily increase the volume to 38 liters in seconds.



The pockets under the secure velcro flap
The pockets under the flaps is an ideal place for the most valuable things such as a wallet, phone, passport…

Spring hook for the keys
Sometime we forget the keys in the apartments room or at home. We decided to take care of this and added a spring hook for keys on a harness, which is available in all sizes of the bag and always remains in your pocket. Now you will not be able to forget the keys.

Top zipper pockets
Side pockets with quick access from above, where you can store sunglasses, a compact umbrella, powerbank together with the mobile phone.


Coins and ticket pocket
This pocket is easily accessible to put a ticket or coins into it, whenever you use a travel size, or a laptop size, or a crossbody size.



Built-in flashlight
At any size of the bag, there is always the built-in flashlight, usually hidden under a flap that is easy to hide. Highlight your map, road, door lock.



Buckles for the spring hooks
To free up your hands and carry a bag over your shoulder, each size of the bag has its own buckles for the spring hooks.

Fabric, colors, sizes
Waterproof, wrinkle-resistant fabric, very soft to fold and tight enough to hold the shape of the bag. We offer three colours of the bag: slategray, cobalt and carbon.
Fabric is from polyester with polyurethane impregnation, very soft to fold and tight enough to keep bag shape. 




The size of the ""Trinus"" 3-in-1 bag.



Toiletry bag
The convenient toiletry bag is made from the same fabric comes with the bag for storing toiletries.

Compact folding umbrella
So that the rain does not take you by surprise, we pack our bags with a super compact folding umbrella that fits even into a regular trouser pocket. Umbrella material is made of ponge fabric, the umbrella becomes dry simply by brushing drops from it. The small size of an EVA case can be confused with a case for ordinary glasses.

Traditionally, this has meant using coolers that need new ice every other day or staying in range of a refrigerator. The Furrion eRove eliminates the need for ice and lets you disconnect your adventures from civilization while keeping everything cold for up to 5 days on a single charge.The eRove is a sleek, high-tech portable refrigeration system. Simply charge the swappable ePod battery, stow your food and drinks, and get on the move, secure in the knowledge that everything you packed will stay cool and dry for up to 5 days.No more ice. No more soggy sandwiches. No more lukewarm drinks. The eRove is here.eRove can freeze your food at subzero temperatures without ice. Freeze your goods at temperatures as low as -8° F.eRove’s innovative foam insulation technology keeps your food cold for days, and its low energy consumption and smart mode capability mean that it uses just the right amount of power, making your charge last longer.eRove will actively cool or even freeze your food for up to 5 days with a battery. You can swap in a fresh ePod battery for an additional 5 days.Thanks to its innovative construction, eRove can keep ice frozen for up to 10 days—and that’s without a battery. Combining the eRove’s battery power with ice will keep your food fresh for an astounding 14 days on a single charge, and the swappable battery and solar charging options mean that you can keep your eRove’s contents ready to consume for as long as you need.Whether you’re staying close to home, heading out for a week, or planning an extended trip, the eRove has a power source to meet your needs. Whether you want to power your eRove or use your ePod Power Station to power other devices, we’ve got the solution you’re looking for.Use the AC adapter to cool the eRove at home so you can load it into your car and go. You’ll be set for 1-2 days of superior cooling without a battery or the need for ice. Top up your chill from the car with the included DC adapter.Charge an ePod battery for up to 5 days of worry-free food storage. If 5 days isn’t enough chill time for you, charge an extra ePod battery and store it in the eRove’s handy dry storage compartment so you can swap it into the ePod battery dock when you need it.With the Furrion Solar Panel, you can keep going for as long as you want. Simply set it up in the sun and plug it into your eRove to get a steady charge from the sun—again and again.With two USB 2.0 ports and one USB fast charge port, you can plug all of your accessories in with ease. Your eRove even has a 10W wireless charging pad, so no matter what high-tech gadgets you’re using, you won’t have to worry about how to keep them going.When you put an ePod battery into the ePod Power Station, you can power your eRove, refill a spare battery, and charge up to six devices at the same time. With two AC outputs, 3 USB ports, and one USB-C port, the Power Station can charge it all. Charge a smartphone up to 30 times, a camera up to 28 times, and a drone up to 4 times. Plugging in the Furrion Solar Panel makes the Power Station a self-sufficient lithium-ion solar generator that will power your devices, improve the ePod’s battery life, and charge your eRove at the same time.There’s nothing worse than reaching for a drink on a warm day only to find that someone’s taken the last can from the cooler. With a 50 Qt internal capacity, eRove can store up to 72 cans. eRove solves the problem by giving you space to keep everyone’s favorites cool.Want to bring more than just drinks? eRove has room for that, too. With 6 Qt of dry storage space, eRove gives you the room you need to bring the things you want—and keeps everything fresh and cool, without worrying about it getting soggy.With other coolers, any food left by the time you get home was probably destined for the trash: it had gotten too warm, or too wet, or smelled like the damp inside of a cooler. With the eRove, your food will stay at the right temperature without ice, so it will be as fresh on the day you get home as it was on the day you left.It’s frustrating to need to plan a trip around where you can stop to get more ice. It makes it difficult to truly disconnect, knowing that you’ll have to trudge into town to restock. Unless you wanted a steady diet of preserved food and warm water, you didn’t have another option—until now.The 100W Furrion Solar Panel lets you truly go off the grid for as long as you want. No more worrying about bags of ice or food spoiling—just hook up the solar panel and set it in a sunny spot, and nature will take care of the rest. We have been 4 weeks off-grid in the Australian outback using solar power to charge the ePod battery. Charging 3-4 hours a day is enough to maintain a full charge.Regular coolers (and even most electric coolers) are a one-trick pony: they use ice to keep your contents cold for a limited time, and... that’s it. The eRove keeps your things cooler for longer while you’re on the move, but that’s not the only use it has. The eRove is great for:Each component was chosen carefully for its unique qualities and uses, and when combined, they work together to form the best, most durable portable refrigeration and energy system on the planet. The combination of eRove’s cooling algorithm, wall thickness, and foam insulation give it best in class ice retention and battery life. What’s more, our designers have kept it looking great while ensuring first-class temperature retention.We designed the eRove with an innovative new foam insulation technology that keeps the cold in for longer. In tests, the eRove can keep ice frozen for a full day longer than any other cooler on the market. This technology works in tandem with the swappable ePod battery to ensure that whatever you put in your eRove stays exactly as cold as you want it for up to 5 days on a full charge.The main structure of the eRove is made of 3"" thick foam with high-quality ABS plastic, which means that the body is lightweight yet sturdy. The interior is made of aluminum to keep it strong yet lightweight.The side panels are fashioned from high density polyethylene, making it corrosion resistant and able to withstand a rough-and-tumble life. The side skirting panels, meanwhile, are made from polypropylene, which helps eRove maintain a consistent internal temperature. The foam insulation, made of polyurethane and cyclopentane, is high-pressure injected for the best possible cooling retention. The wheels are made of rubber, not plastic, which means they have high vibration resistance and can easily navigate tough terrain.eRove’s software makes minute adjustments based on temperature inside and outside the cooler, leading to a 40% better battery life.Keep things chilled or keep them frozen. Easily set the temperature anywhere from -8°F to +50°F with the touch of a button.Set your compatible device on the built-in 10W wireless charging pad and leave your extra accessories at home.Plug in all of your accessories and charge them from the ePod battery or optional solar attachment.Take your eRove with you on nearly any surface. The detachable rubber wheel kit is extremely durable and easy to attach.Pull it up when you’re on the move. Stash it away when you’re in the car or at your campsite. Use it with the serving tray to serve food and drinks.Know the exact temperature inside your eRove at a single glance.Don’t settle for whichever drink you happen to grab from your cooler. Find exactly what you’re in the mood for the first time.Keep your drinks safe in the two-slot cup holders. Remove it easily when on the move.Hold your umbrella or fishing rod effortlessly with the removable holder.Conveniently serve your favorite food on the stowaway tray.The Bottle opener is never far away. Open you drinks with the integrated opener.Charge it up, store it in the dry storage compartment, and easily swap it in when you need it.Charge your ePod batteries from an outlet or from the solar panel, or use it with an ePod battery to charge your devices.The Furrion eRove portable electric cooler Starter Package is the base component of our exclusive Indiegogo Packages. Ideal for single day use with pre-cooling to hang in the backyard, the park, the beach, and everywhere in between.Our Adventure Package (an IndieGoGo exclusive!) includes everything you need for up to 5 days of fresh, cool food storage.Our Off-Grid Package includes everything you need to disconnect and completely go off-the grid.Additional accessories can take your eRove experience from standard chill to super cool.Founded by three marine engineers with a passion for outdoors and exploration.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Emily. I'm currently entering my senior year of college in New York City. This fall, I'm studying abroad in Florence, Italy, and wanted to create an art project about my experience. Here it is! I'm the creator of the Polaroid Project.</p>
<p>I was inspired to create a project where the art comes to the viewer, not the other way around as it typically is. I read about Shelley Jackson's INERADICABLE SKIN project years ago, and it is the main inspiration point for this project today. Shelley, a novelist, is tattooing one word from her 2,095-word novel on anyone willing to participate. 2095 people will be walking around touched by her work.</p>
<p>I wanted to create something similarly accessible. The Polaroid Project is 400 photos of my daily life in Europe for 4 months, sent out to anyone who wants one anywhere in the world. Additionally, members of the project will be invited to our Facebook group, where we can share life experiences, knowledge, travel stories, quotes, questions, and more. I'm taking 5 classes about Italian language, history, food, film, and culture, so I'm using the group to share some things I learn (and hopefully learn some things from all of you!).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>*<strong>disclaimer</strong>: I WILL do this project regardless of if the goal is reached or not. I simply chose that number because 400 photos * $10 each = 4000. No matter if I reach it or not, you'll get a photo. Promise!</p>
<p>I wish I could do this for free, but film is really expensive. Your $10 will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>40 packs of Instax Wide film</li>
<li>AAA batteries (to keep the camera alive)</li>
<li>envelopes for sending the photos to you</li>
<li>postage</li>
<li>an Instax Wide camera</li>
<li>anything left over will allow me to travel more and make interesting content for the Facebook group</li>
</ul>
<p>I've created 2 reward levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>$5 or more - Facebook Group Access<ul>
<li>This is where I'll be posting all of my travel diaries, videos, recipes, questions, and more.</li>
<li>I want this to be somewhere where we can spread positivity, grow, and get to know each other!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>$10 or more - Polaroid + Facebook Group Access<ul>
<li>You'll receive 1 of the 400 photos in the project.</li>
<li>They'll be labeled by where they were taken and what number they are in the series</li>
<li>Share on social media with #emilyspolaroidproject when you receive yours!</li>
<li>They will be shipping in December when I return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By the end of December, you'll have learned a little Italian, a little bit of history, a little bit about food, and a lot about yourself (and hopefully have made some new friends!). You'll also have your own Polaroid, the only of its kind in the world. Frame it, post it, hang it up, give it to a friend, give it life!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Ideally, I wanted to send all the photos as I took them. However, I'll be sending 100 at a time to my family's house in North Carolina. This decreases the cost of postage and makes it easier to send them all out when I return in December. I'll be sure to post sneak peeks of photos as I take them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, that's totally fine! I would love if you shared with a friend or two who you think would like to partake. </p>
<p>Feel free to use the share tools on this page to share on social media as well!</p>

You'll also have your own Polaroid, the only of its kind in the world. Frame it, post it, hang it up, give it to a friend, give it life!

Risks & Challenges
Ideally, I wanted to send all the photos as I took them. However, I'll be sending 100 at a time to my family's house in North Carolina. This decreases the cost of postage and makes it easier to send them all out when I return in December. I'll be sure to post sneak peeks of photos as I take them.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, that's totally fine! I would love if you shared with a friend or two who you think would like to partake.

<p>I'm a former Facebooker, serial entrepreneur, and now the founder of Tara&amp;Co where we re-imagine products for women on-the-go.  I lead a team of designers, mechanical engineers, and women like you who create beautiful accessories that provide both form and function for your everyday life.</p>
<p>Tara&amp;Co was born out of my own need when I was running around from meeting to social event to a meeting doing business at my last company.  My shoulder hurt from carrying my laptop, and I was tipping over in my heels from the combined weight of it and all my other materials.  I thought, where are all the products for the women of today – Women who need to protect and carry their devices and have dynamic lifestyles that go from day to night?  Where are those products?</p>
<p>I couldn't find anything in market, so I decided to change that.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530112512/sw5k6ijge5vcbuegy4ao.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The name, “Tara” is inspired and named after “Green Tara” the Buddhist mother goddess, who represents action, great strength, and the virtues of success in work and achievements.  We felt like this represented the women we were designing for.</p>

<p>Our first solution to  build something sleek and elegant, but also functional and useful was the Tracy 2-in-1 Bag, which we officially launched in November 2017. Made of beautiful luxurious leather, it’s a 3-way convertible bag that can hold up to a 13” laptop and has a zip-off clutch. Yes, that’s right — it turns into two bags!</p>
<p>The Tracy was a hit. We were covered by Fast Company, Brit + Co, LA Fashion Magazine, and more. We launched with more than $110k of pre-sales and officially sold out in just a few short months.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530112692/gpxajaliykilyd4r7qil.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Since my background is in startups, I approach building a new bag like building a novel tech product.  We survey women about what they want and what they need. We test our products continuously. We continue to reiterate our design based on such feedback.</p>
<p>It’s not easy to make something beautiful while creating a bag that looks great in multiple forms, but we have a great team of designers, mechanical engineers, and women like you, who prototype and build on those initial design ideas. Ultimately, we’re building products to solve problems in your everyday life.</p>
<p>And we’re just getting started.  My goal is to keep solving problems for women on-the-go — to support them by giving them products that are realistic for their lives today. Why should we have to compromise fashion for function? We deserve both.</p>

<h3><strong>The Danielle Weekender </strong></h3>
<p>Our woman on-the-go likes to travel.  When we spoke to her about what she needed in travel, three specific things came up again and again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Her <strong>travel was dynamic</strong>, so she often felt like she didn’t have the right accessory for the right occasion. She usually traveled with a duffel for her clothes, a mid-sized bag for daytime exploring, and something small and chic to take out at night.</li>
<li>She <strong>ran out of power… all the time</strong>. She ended up being one of those people you see at the airport, sitting on the floor so her device could be plugged into the wall. So many of the women we surveyed shared a similar story, explaining that they ran out of power regularly and needed to carry an additional battery with them when they traveled.</li>
<li>She wanted a way to <strong>separate out things that were clean and dirty</strong>. When she was on the go, she didn’t want to have to worry about if the blouse she wanted to wear today got too close to yesterday’s well-worn outfit.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>So we built it.</strong></p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530145077/gwlb5xkisj94giu33vok.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p><strong>Our Danielle bag boasts 3 bags:</strong></p>
<p>1) A larger, lightweight luxurious yet water-resistant <strong>nylon tote</strong> that can hold weekend clothes, toiletries, a jacket and more. With a 13” padded pocket, it comes with places for all your devices</p>

<p>This 2-in-1 bag is built for <strong>active women on-the-go</strong>. A perfect everyday work bag, with a small silhouette that fits your day-to-day commute and has a place for all your devices , gym accessories and more.  It expands when you need it to hold your gym shoes, heels, or anything else you'd need to keep separate.</p>

<p>We built the 2-in-1 Heather bag for women who carry devices and work out. When we started talking to this type of woman, there were two specific problems she mentioned:</p>
<ol>
<li>She wanted a <strong>smaller everyday bag</strong> to hold and protect her devices – something that looked cute and chic and not oversized.</li>
<li>She often <strong>needed to carry a pair of extra shoes</strong>, whether to work out before or after work, or to transport with her on her daily commute.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that's what we built.  <strong>Our Heather bag is the perfect everyday work bag with two fashionable yet functional silhouettes.</strong></p>

<p>Our ""everyday"" smaller silhouette has organization to protect and hold your devices like a laptop (padded pocket for up to 13'' laptop), charger, phone and more. There's also ample space for active wear including a change of clothes, a water bottle, lock, hairbands, and more.</p>

<h3>Women Who Inspire Us</h3>
<p>Our mission is to connect, elevate, and create products for women on-the-go so we name all of our products after women who inspire us.  Our first bag is named, “The Tracy,” was named after Tracy Chou – former Pinterest and Quora engineer and entrepreneur – for her work in diversity and inclusion in tech.  Her blog post spurred 250 tech companies to release their otherwise well guarded diversity numbers so we could have a real conversation about diversity.  </p>
<p>This year, we took our <strong>inspiration from three more impactful women:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3-in-1 “Danielle” Weekender after Danielle Kayembe</strong>, the Founder and CEO of GreyFire Impact, for the work she’s done in social impact, supporting female entrepreneurs and bringing attention to the female-driven economy.</p>

<p><strong>The 2-in-1 “Heather” Work Gym bag after Heather McPhie Watanabe</strong>, a 2x Olympic Mogul Skier, for being a trailblazing athlete, a mentor in skiing, and an accomplished woman in finance.</p>

<p>I know, I know, November feels like a long way off, but crafting a great product takes time and we'd love to have you with us on the journey.  If you're in the market for a bag today, please check out our bestselling first bag, the <strong>Tracy 2-in-1 bag</strong>.  It's a stylish and convertible bag 2 in 1 bag that you can wear three ways.  It's <strong>available now</strong> on our website at <a href=""http://www.taraand.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.taraand.co</a>.</p>

<p>Like any startup, there are challenges and unforeseen circumstances.  However, we were able to ship the Tracy 2-in-1 bag <strong>early</strong> last year and have lots of experience bringing products to market.  We're confident that we can do it again.  Our products are close to being finalized, but we will continue to improve the bags aesthetically and functionally, so you will receive the best possible products.  That may mean tweaking, adding, or removing features to give you a better experience.</p>
<p>Production generally takes ~2 months of time to create, but can vary based on a number of factors including large quantity of units to create, differences in material, unclear specs etc.  Because our zippers are YKK and extremely high quality, they take over 20 days alone to order.  However, our team is experienced in design and production and we are confident that we'll get you a high quality product that you'll love.</p>

Curious what products we're launching?  Learn about us in 1 minute or less.


I'm a former Facebooker, serial entrepreneur, and now the founder of Tara&Co where we re-imagine products for women on-the-go.  I lead a team of designers, mechanical engineers, and women like you who create beautiful accessories that provide both form and function for your everyday life.
Tara&Co was born out of my own need when I was running around from meeting to social event to a meeting doing business at my last company.  My shoulder hurt from carrying my laptop, and I was tipping over in my heels from the combined weight of it and all my other materials.  I thought, where are all the products for the women of today – Women who need to protect and carry their devices and have dynamic lifestyles that go from day to night?  Where are those products?
I couldn't find anything in market, so I decided to change that.


The name, “Tara” is inspired and named after “Green Tara” the Buddhist mother goddess, who represents action, great strength, and the virtues of success in work and achievements.  We felt like this represented the women we were designing for.

Our first solution to  build something sleek and elegant, but also functional and useful was the Tracy 2-in-1 Bag, which we officially launched in November 2017. Made of beautiful luxurious leather, it’s a 3-way convertible bag that can hold up to a 13” laptop and has a zip-off clutch. Yes, that’s right — it turns into two bags!
The Tracy was a hit. We were covered by Fast Company, Brit + Co, LA Fashion Magazine, and more. We launched with more than $110k of pre-sales and officially sold out in just a few short months.


Since my background is in startups, I approach building a new bag like building a novel tech product.  We survey women about what they want and what they need. We test our products continuously. We continue to reiterate our design based on such feedback.
It’s not easy to make something beautiful while creating a bag that looks great in multiple forms, but we have a great team of designers, mechanical engineers, and women like you, who prototype and build on those initial design ideas. Ultimately, we’re building products to solve problems in your everyday life.
And we’re just getting started.  My goal is to keep solving problems for women on-the-go — to support them by giving them products that are realistic for their lives today. Why should we have to compromise fashion for function? We deserve both.

 

Now, introducing our second line of bags: The 3-in-1 Danielle Weekender — your ideal weekend travel bag; The 2-in-1 Heather Work Gym Bag — perfect for the active daily commuter; and The 2-in-1 Sharon Minimalist Backpack Portfolio — for the efficient professional woman.

 

   3-in-1 Weekender

This 3-in-1 bag is the new favorite travel buddy for women on-the-go; our travel bag is the ideal TSA-friendly Weekender. The perfect travel bag as a flight carry-on or your road trip buddy with a stylish silhouette and design.  The Weekender features a 13” padded pocket and places for all your devices even including a zip-out pocket  that becomes your fold-out explorer day-pack (with your choice of a fold-out backpack or tote). This 3-in-1 bag holds your weekend clothes, toiletries, jacket and of course our attachable clutch in 5 different color options.

Watch this 1 minute demo for all the highlights of this 3-in-1 bag travel bag (and a catchy song)!

 

The Danielle Weekender 
Our woman on-the-go likes to travel.  When we spoke to her about what she needed in travel, three specific things came up again and again:

Her travel was dynamic, so she often felt like she didn’t have the right accessory for the right occasion. She usually traveled with a duffel for her clothes, a mid-sized bag for daytime exploring, and something small and chic to take out at night.
She ran out of power… all the time. She ended up being one of those people you see at the airport, sitting on the floor so her device could be plugged into the wall. So many of the women we surveyed shared a similar story, explaining that they ran out of power regularly and needed to carry an additional battery with them when they traveled.
She wanted a way to separate out things that were clean and dirty. When she was on the go, she didn’t want to have to worry about if the blouse she wanted to wear today got too close to yesterday’s well-worn outfit.

So we built it.

Our Danielle bag boasts 3 bags:
1) A larger, lightweight luxurious yet water-resistant nylon tote that can hold weekend clothes, toiletries, a jacket and more. With a 13” padded pocket, it comes with places for all your devices

2) A zip-out pouch on the larger bag becomes a fold-out explorer daypack. This daypack can fit a lightweight jacket, water bottle, book and more. Even better, there’s a choice of a fold-out backpack or tote to suit your needs.

3) A chic leather clutch comes in 5 different color options. With a removable strap and its own pocket for essentials, it’s the perfect bag to bring along to dinner or drinks.


Never worry again about getting your clothes dirty with your 3-way zip separate bottom compartment meant for shoes or soiled clothes.

 

Built in charger pocket to your weekender for exterior charging. *charger and cord not included.

This 2-in-1 bag is built for active women on-the-go. A perfect everyday work bag, with a small silhouette that fits your day-to-day commute and has a place for all your devices , gym accessories and more.  It expands when you need it to hold your gym shoes, heels, or anything else you'd need to keep separate.

We built the 2-in-1 Heather bag for women who carry devices and work out. When we started talking to this type of woman, there were two specific problems she mentioned:

She wanted a smaller everyday bag to hold and protect her devices – something that looked cute and chic and not oversized.
She often needed to carry a pair of extra shoes, whether to work out before or after work, or to transport with her on her daily commute.

And that's what we built.  Our Heather bag is the perfect everyday work bag with two fashionable yet functional silhouettes.


Our ""everyday"" smaller silhouette has organization to protect and hold your devices like a laptop (padded pocket for up to 13'' laptop), charger, phone and more. There's also ample space for active wear including a change of clothes, a water bottle, lock, hairbands, and more.


Zip down both sides for a 2nd silhouette which is a fully separated compartment. Use it for your gym shoes, heels, or dirty laundry. Open top allows you extra space as needed and ability to aerate.


Two bags that you can wear separately or together with our signature standalone smooth leather clutch.

Women Who Inspire Us
Our mission is to connect, elevate, and create products for women on-the-go so we name all of our products after women who inspire us.  Our first bag is named, “The Tracy,” was named after Tracy Chou – former Pinterest and Quora engineer and entrepreneur – for her work in diversity and inclusion in tech.  Her blog post spurred 250 tech companies to release their otherwise well guarded diversity numbers so we could have a real conversation about diversity.  
This year, we took our inspiration from three more impactful women:
The 3-in-1 “Danielle” Weekender after Danielle Kayembe, the Founder and CEO of GreyFire Impact, for the work she’s done in social impact, supporting female entrepreneurs and bringing attention to the female-driven economy.

The 2-in-1 “Heather” Work Gym bag after Heather McPhie Watanabe, a 2x Olympic Mogul Skier, for being a trailblazing athlete, a mentor in skiing, and an accomplished woman in finance.

The 2-in-1 “Sharon” Minimalistic Portfolio Backpack after Sharon Tal Yguado who’s the Head of Genre Original Series at Amazon Studios, for continuing to innovate in media and rising in leadership at a Fortune 500 company.


We pride ourselves at Tara&Co for being able to provide you versatility for your dynamic lifestyle.  That means that our products have a lot of features. How do you pick just one?  (PS: You can pick as many as you like).
But ... if you have to choose just one, use the grid below to find your favorite features and see which Tara&Co bag is best for you.
 

 

We're a team of professional women, bag designers, and mechanical engineers.  I'm a former Facebook employee and longtime female founder.  We have a collaborative building philosophy so we constantly ask professional women what they want and need and design it into our bags.
We've talked to and tested our bags with hundreds of women.  Ladies love our new line.
We like to solve problems and build the products that women of today need.   We shouldn't have to compromise fashion for function -- we deserve both.

With $20,000 you can help contribute to bring our 2nd line to life and bring more products to women on-the-go.  Over the last six months, we've designed, re-designed, tested, re-tested over 15 prototypes and now we're almost ready to move into production.  We have a few tweaks left, but we're almost there.  We think you'll love what we've built, but we need your help. 


Any master piece takes time, but we're carefully refining your bags and will have them in your hands before the holidays.


I know, I know, November feels like a long way off, but crafting a great product takes time and we'd love to have you with us on the journey.  If you're in the market for a bag today, please check out our bestselling first bag, the Tracy 2-in-1 bag.  It's a stylish and convertible bag 2 in 1 bag that you can wear three ways.  It's available now on our website at www.taraand.co.

Like any startup, there are challenges and unforeseen circumstances.  However, we were able to ship the Tracy 2-in-1 bag early last year and have lots of experience bringing products to market.  We're confident that we can do it again.  Our products are close to being finalized, but we will continue to improve the bags aesthetically and functionally, so you will receive the best possible products.  That may mean tweaking, adding, or removing features to give you a better experience.
Production generally takes ~2 months of time to create, but can vary based on a number of factors including large quantity of units to create, differences in material, unclear specs etc.  Because our zippers are YKK and extremely high quality, they take over 20 days alone to order.  However, our team is experienced in design and production and we are confident that we'll get you a high quality product that you'll love.


If you’re inspired by our mission at Tara&Co and  want more products built for women on-the-go, we hope you’ll support our next line.  Any amount of contribution or sharing with friends via social media or email goes a long way.
Our products would not be possible without you.  We hope you'll love our next line as much as we do.
Tara, style for your life.

It lifts grease and evaporates quickly, leaving no residue. With just three ingredients: ~80% alcohol, water, and lemon oil—pure lemon extract is a simple, effective, and food-safe solution for on-the-go cleaning. Plus, it smells great and is natural enough to eat with wet utensils.  We recycled an old idea.Traveling with one’s own cutlery is far from a new idea. People have been doing it for centuries—well before the first plastic spork was invented. Yet today, even given what we know about how plastic trash affects the planet and every creature on it, and even with a myriad of portable, reusable cutlery options out there, carrying one’s personal cutlery around just hasn’t quite taken off.We wanted to find out why, so we did a little market research. 50% of our respondents told us that their cutlery was inconvenient to clean on the go, while 75% sheepishly admitted that they simply forget to bring it along. Plus, there’s a perception that disposable utensils are cleaner than reusable ones.Oh hello, cutlery that comes with its own cleaning tool inside a custom case that’s easy to take wherever you go. Nice to see you in our purses and backpacks and glove boxes, staying all clean and shiny and ready for wherever life takes us. You wanna go out to dinner sometime? Stainless steel crushes the competition.Of course, there are other eco-friendly cutlery sets out there—like bamboo, which clings to guacamole like an unrequited high-school crush. Or edible cutlery, which is not nearly as delicious as it sounds. Or compostable cutlery. (Good luck finding a communal compost bin at your subway station, or remote parking lot, or even outside a restaurant.)Stainless steel is sustainable, reusable, and can even be recycled when you’re done with it. (Which will probably happen like never, since stainless steel is also exceptionally durable.) Our goal? Zero waste.© Zero Waste International Alliance  Who do we think we are?I’m Cameron Drake, and before Cliffset, I learned a lot about the importance of sustainable, reusable, recyclable products that reduce waste. Partly because I lived on a boat—where I saw piles of plastic debris floating on the ocean—and partly because when I was on land, I got pretty tired of using plastic forks. In fact, I’m all about food and sustainability. At UC Berkeley, I wrote my thesis on the food packaging revolution that created this mess in the first place. I’m also a founding partner of San Francisco-based Good Use Juice, which makes delicious cold-pressed juices from surplus, misshapen, or oddly sized produce that would otherwise go to waste.      Team Cliffset.Cliffset simply wouldn’t be here without the help of incredibly talented, hard-working, and generous colleagues, friends, and family. What connects us all? Our belief in sustainability, environmental responsibility, and eating well wherever we go. We’ve come a long way. And we’re counting on backers like you to get us over the finish line. Go, team, go! We love our Mother. We’re a member of 1% for the Planet, a group of companies like Patagonia, Honest Tea, and OXO that are committed to positive environmental change here on Mother Earth.   Easy to clean.

<h3>MEET CINCH! – THE ULTIMATE POP-UP TENT</h3>
<p>Camping should be hassle-free, and give you more time to enjoy the great outdoors. That’s why we created Cinch!

<p>Hot summer days are what camping’s all about, right? Except when you wake up like a sous-vide carrot.

<p><strong>FOOT PRINT</strong></p>
<p>So what's a foot print? It's a separate groundsheet that's cut-to-size for each tent, that you place underneath your Cinch! to provide extra protection. It means that you can pack your tent away with out the base being dirty, and extend its lifespan. The foot print is a separate piece of material that packs into its own little bag. It's much easier to clean and less fiddly than unpacking and wiping down your tent when you get home. It's not essential by any means – but it's a great extra, and we've introduced it based on lots of requests from our backers.</p>
<p><strong>COMFORT AND DURABILITY</strong></p>
<p>Cinch! is packed with features that you’ll rarely find inside a pop-up tent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-skin to prevent condensation</li>
<li>Groundsheet stitched to outer tent, keeping porch free of water and bugs</li>
<li>Double-taped seams to prevent damp</li>
<li>Outer layer is made from 4000HH fabric – three times the industry standard for waterproofing</li>
<li>Extra-thick, bathtub-style groundsheet. Nine-times industry standard for waterproofing: 12000HH</li>
<li>Two entrances provide instant ventilation</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EQUIPPED FOR THE DARK</strong></p>
<p>Night time is just as important as day when you’re camping, and just as fun. That’s why we’ve kitted out the Cinch! with LED tent pegs and light-reflective guylines to make your tent visible at night. This year, we’ve also added some luminous guylines which will stay visible even when no light source is shining on them. Plus you’ll get two LED torches with every tent. With a quick transformation, the torches turn into lanterns, and you can hang them from hooks on the roof.</p>

<p><strong>LOADS OF SPACE YET EASY TO TRANSPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Cinch! comes in 2-, 3- and 4-man sizes, and each is the biggest in its class. The 4-man is the biggest pop-up tent in the world, with 6.24 m2 living space.</p>
<p>Size was our first consideration when designing the range. Why should you have to compensate on space, for the convenience of a pop-up? Why not have both? Our tents have a huge internal living area, with two large porches that double up as storage areas next to each door. See the diagram below for full dimensions. The tent then packs down within a minute into a disc-shaped rucksack with all the kit, weighing just 5kg for the 2-man version.</p>

<p>We have offices in the UK, USA and Australia (please contact us to organise localised shipping to Australia) and have managed to get a localised shipping rates for these countries – but doing so for other countries would need a number of backers to make it feasible. Shipping costs are listed below. If we get enough orders from your country to organise localised shipping, we'll recalculate the costs and refund you the difference.</p>
<p>If you are from a country and would love a tent but can’t pay postage then reach out to us and if we get enough of you then we can significantly lower these costs. If your country is not listed and you think it should be, then get in touch and we can get shipping prices to you, we will ship anywhere in the world.  </p>

<h3>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>The Cinch! is the ultimate pop-up tent, and that’s a claim we don’t make lightly – but naturally it sets the bar very high indeed. We’ve spent years developing and refining the idea, and we’ve worked extremely hard to get the product ready for Indiegogo, so we’re not prepared to execute it poorly. We’ve run successful crowdfunding campaigns for Cinch! before, so we know exactly what we’re doing. But here are what I see as some of the risks:</p>
<p>MANUFACTURING: This is a process where many things can go wrong, but we already have six years’ experience in manufacturing the tent, and have robust plans in place for all eventualities. We’re confident that our manufacturer can handle the size of the production run – we’ve identified a partner with the capacity to scale-up easily – and we plan to personally oversee all the important stages of the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As we gear up the Cinch! for production, it’s likely that we’ll make some minor adjustments to improve the final product. What you see on this page is the minimum of what you’ll get – we’ve made a big claim and we won’t cut any corners to get there. Our prototype is already based on a successful market product – in our standard Cinch! tent – and most of its features have been suggested as improvements by our customers, and negotiated in detail with our experienced manufacturer. Adjustments will always be for the benefit of you, our customer, and we will let you know exactly how, when and why they are made.</p>
<p>FULFILMENT: Sometimes we’re faced with an unpredictable situation – e.g. a supplier misses a deadline, there’s a breakdown of machinery, or a shipment gets lost. Those things can cause a delay. However to minimise the possibility of any setbacks, we have backup factories at the ready, and I will be personally orchestrating the communication between our suppliers, all the way through to delivering your order to your door.</p>
<p>We are working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering large quantities of excellent-quality products in the outdoor industry. Undoubtedly there will be some surprises along the way, but we’re confident that our knowledge, expertise and experience will deliver the highest-quality Cinch! tent to you, on-time and on-budget.</p>
<p>Any pledge that you’re able to make brings us one step closer to achieving our goal, and finally giving the camping community the kind of tent it deserves.

However to minimise the possibility of any setbacks, we have backup factories at the ready, and I will be personally orchestrating the communication between our suppliers, all the way through to delivering your order to your door.
We are working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering large quantities of excellent-quality products in the outdoor industry. Undoubtedly there will be some surprises along the way, but we’re confident that our knowledge, expertise and experience will deliver the highest-quality Cinch! tent to you, on-time and on-budget.
Any pledge that you’re able to make brings us one step closer to achieving our goal, and finally giving the camping community the kind of tent it deserves. Help us make the Cinch! a success by clicking the ‘Back This Project’ button at the top of the page, or by helping us spread the word by sharing our page. THANK YOU SO MUCH for your help!",15.0,1,"2 Campaigns

BALLISTIC NYLON VS CASUAL NYLON
Close-up of the two nylon fabrics
 

 
The casual nylon has a smaller weave than the ballistic nylon, but it is as durable and as abrasion resistant as the ballistic nylon.   We wanted a casual nylon because the fabric looks canvas-like from a distance, and it gives the JW Weekender a more carefree feel.

<p>Like some of our other previously Kickstart-ed Taskin gear? We love our backers, especially those who have backed us before. So as a thank you, you will get the credit as indicated by the table above. The credit will be available to you when you take the survey and can be applied to any of the following products.</p>
<p>These products are made at a different factory (and country) so can't be packed together. They will ship separately. </p>

<p><b>Balanced Shell-Body Construction</b></p>
<p>The Edge doesn't do droopy. Unlike backpacks that need air pillows or paper stuffing to stand up straight, the Edge's unique construction and underlying materials ensure that it's always ready, whether it's empty or packed full. </p>
<div data-id=""21896088""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1534806929/clsf2syoz4cbyx8hxoug.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Edge also doesn't need something to lean on or a chair to slouch in, it will stand where you put it down. Edge is well balanced to ensure that it stays upright no matter its content. Shell-Body also ensures that the contents inside are better protected.</p>

<p>You don't buy the laptop to fit the backpack, right? That's why we designed the Edge to ensure that no matter your laptop preferences, it'll fit safely and securely. Edge's unique, adjustable strap keeps it well-protected within a specially-padded compartment.</p>
<p>The Edge's laptop &amp; tablet compartment can accommodate laptops up to 41 x 26.5 x 2.5 cms and tablets or documents up to 34 x 25 x 1.5 cms. Depending on the manufacturer up to 17"" inch laptop but check your laptop size to confirm.</p>

<h3>Stretch Goal - $200,000</h3>

<p>Our stretch goal of $200k will help fund our infomercial. Chawel will then take the world by storm. We have it all lined up and ready to go, we just need your help.</p>

<p><br/>  <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/TheChawel?c=gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Chawel Uses Demo""><img alt=""Chawel Demo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.chawel.com/media/demo.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Chawel Uses Demo""/></a></p>
<p><em>Chawels functions demo</em></p>
<hr/><h3>Chawel Background Story</h3>
<p>I created the Chawel in 2002 during my first season as a beach lifeguard. It was meant to be a replacement for moms always having to hold towels up for their kids to change. Now everyone uses it to changing at the beach or on the pool deck or in parking lots. It's faster than having to hold towels up for other to change behind, or worrying about your towel falling off while changing out of wet swimwear.</p>
<p>No more hiding behind car doors in a parking lot, slip on your Chawel and be changed faster than with a small towel wrapped around your waist.</p>
<p>Chawel developed its other functions/uses, adapting to the needs of backpacking travelers, and the situation that may occur (like flight cancelations or layovers, leaving you stuck in the airport overnight).</p>
<hr/><h3>Less is MORE</h3>
<p>Functionality is one of the things that our customers love. Not only is the Chawel Hybrid an antibacterial, quick dry towel, but it also functions as your personal <strong>CHANGING ROOM</strong> wherever you are. And if you are flying away for vacation, airlines charge for blankets and pillows now, so pack your Chawel onboard with you and use it as a <strong>BLANKET</strong> or roll it up for a comfy <strong>NECK/TRAVEL PILLOW</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/><h3>Why you NEED a Chawel</h3>
<p><img alt=""functionality"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.chawel.com/media/functionality.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Functionality""/></p>
<p>Whether you are a world traveler, a soccer mom, a camper, or a beach bum, Chawel will come in handy wherever you are!</p>
<p><strong>Beach at sunset</strong></p>
<p>As the air gets a little cooler at sunset. A normal towel won't cut it to block the wind. Just slip into your Chawel feet first, pulling it up to your chin. And just like that, warm and comfy again.</p>
<p><strong>On a boat</strong></p>
<p>From just cruising around or waiting for your next turn on the wake, keep warm and dry in your Chawel.</p>
<p><strong>On the Beach, Pool or Parking lot</strong></p>
<p>Can't find a Changing room? Or maybe mom can't let kids go off on their own to changing rooms. A quick solution is to put on their Chawel and change right there with complete privacy. It's easier and faster than having to hold a towel up to change behind</p>
<p><strong>Traveling Anywhere Hot</strong></p>
<p>Like most people who travel to hot destinations, you probably never pack a sweater. Yet, when you go from the sweaty outside heat, back into a train or bus for travel, the Air Conditioning is usually cranked. I know, I've been stuck on a top bunk bed on a train in India for 12 hours. I wish i had a Chawel back then!</p>

Chawel Background Story
I created the Chawel in 2002 during my first season as a beach lifeguard. It was meant to be a replacement for moms always having to hold towels up for their kids to change. Now everyone uses it to changing at the beach or on the pool deck or in parking lots. It's faster than having to hold towels up for other to change behind, or worrying about your towel falling off while changing out of wet swimwear.
No more hiding behind car doors in a parking lot, slip on your Chawel and be changed faster than with a small towel wrapped around your waist.
Chawel developed its other functions/uses, adapting to the needs of backpacking travelers, and the situation that may occur (like flight cancelations or layovers, leaving you stuck in the airport overnight).
Less is MORE
Functionality is one of the things that our customers love. Not only is the Chawel Hybrid an antibacterial, quick dry towel, but it also functions as your personal CHANGING ROOM wherever you are. And if you are flying away for vacation, airlines charge for blankets and pillows now, so pack your Chawel onboard with you and use it as a BLANKET or roll it up for a comfy NECK/TRAVEL PILLOW.
 
Why you NEED a Chawel

Whether you are a world traveler, a soccer mom, a camper, or a beach bum, Chawel will come in handy wherever you are!
Beach at sunset
As the air gets a little cooler at sunset. A normal towel won't cut it to block the wind. Just slip into your Chawel feet first, pulling it up to your chin. And just like that, warm and comfy again.
On a boat
From just cruising around or waiting for your next turn on the wake, keep warm and dry in your Chawel.
On the Beach, Pool or Parking lot
Can't find a Changing room? Or maybe mom can't let kids go off on their own to changing rooms. A quick solution is to put on their Chawel and change right there with complete privacy. It's easier and faster than having to hold a towel up to change behind
Traveling Anywhere Hot
Like most people who travel to hot destinations, you probably never pack a sweater. Yet, when you go from the sweaty outside heat, back into a train or bus for travel, the Air Conditioning is usually cranked. I know, I've been stuck on a top bunk bed on a train in India for 12 hours. I wish i had a Chawel back then!

<p><strong><span class=""font_6"">My Story</span></strong></p>
<p>My name is Kevin Lanuk and I have a vision.  It all began with a single idea just a couple of months ago.  Oddly enough, I was watching the Olympics when an idea came to me.  What if there was a way to help give people hope by taking them on a unique video documentary to Mount Everest?  What if we could raise charity by taking a journey and providing people with an outlet to send their own messages about things they cared about?  I decided to take it a step further by allowing these messages to be blessed and cremated, condensing all of these positive thoughts together. </p>
<p>Essentially, what I’ve done is combined giving to charity along with writing your own personal message.  We all have people and things that we care about in our lives.  Wouldn’t it be nice to tune out of the every day struggle, whether it’s your job, making ends meet, or beating an illness by sending a message on a journey, knowing that you’re giving to charity, and having the ability to tune in, gain hope, find inspiration, and create strength; doing this will humble us and do great good for each other. </p>
<p>I grew up in the Northeastern United States, in the suburbs of Greenwich, Connecticut.  Something I haven’t always talked about is my background, so I would like to take a moment and share it with you.  Most people associate Greenwich with money and kids with spoons in their mouths however; this was not the case with me. </p>
<p>I come from a small working class home in Pemberwick, a place they call HappyValley.  These are modest homes bordering Port Chester, New York.  While my friends were raised by their parents, I grew up being raised by my grandparents, Marcelle and Ritchie.  They are the most amazing people I know and let me tell you why. </p>
<p>My whole life my mom has battled an addiction to drugs and alcohol.  She’s been in and out of prison more times then I can count or remember.  One of the first memories I have with her is being taught to ice skate out on the pond behind our house.  I will never forget that.  I have other memories that will never fade as well. </p>
<p>I remember being taken into the Bronx and walking up a dark dusty staircase into a drab building to see my moms “friend.”  I’ll never forget the distinct smell of that place.  Opening the door into his apartment and walking through beaded passageways I was told to wait in the living room while they discussed business in the kitchen.  My intuition even at a young age of 8 told me something was wrong.  I went to look and was immediately turned away; things were quickly hidden from sight.  That evening while on our way home, I remember the red and blue lights penetrating the rear view window behind me.  The police officer came to the window and shined his flashlight into my eyes.  The next thing I remember was my mom being arrested.  These are the memories that I will keep with me until the day I die. </p>
<p>I’m twenty-three now and my mom is still doing the same things and still making the same mistakes as she did 15 years ago.  I would like it very much to see my mom recover from her addictions so she can spend time with her family and get to know us.   For small periods of time she does. </p>
<p>Recently, she got out of prison again after being there for seventeen months this past October of 2012.  I was so excited to see her, for a month I had my mom.  She had a probational requirement to wear a tracking bracelet and to be home at nine each night.  She was mandated to wear this for one month.  The day she got it off and left the house I was worried about her.  However I let it go because I thought she would be okay.  Two days later, on the day of Thanksgiving she never made it.  She never passed her urine exam; she hasn’t been the same since.  Cocaine or heroin… I don’t know. </p>
<p>If not for my grandparents, who I call nanny and poppy (and still do), I don’t know where I would be or who I would be.  They helped raise me until I was 13 years old.  It was then that I went to live with my father.  When I moved to Stamford I was soo excited.  His home heating oil business was doing great.  He bought a nice big home in the back country of Stamford.  I was very proud of my dad and excited for this new start.  I may not have had my mom, but I had my dad.  I was looking to him for guidance however, I didn’t know that he too was struggling inside, struggling with a serious alcohol addiction.  One that has torn up our family and caused him to lose almost everything he’s ever gained.  His business, his home, and his family. </p>
<p>It’s hard to see your parents or the people you love destroy themselves.  You want so badly to help them.  You want to look up to them and be guided through this crazy world.  Maybe that’s why I am who I am today.  That’s why I want to help people.  People who are struggling.  For me, it’s never been about social status, it’s never been about money, it’s been about being a good person.  At the end of the day, when you look at yourself in the mirror, what kind of person are you?  That has been the driving force for me.  A force for doing good, a force for success.  My background doesn’t make me weak, it makes me strong.  It’s my jet fuel to accomplish great things.  Mountkarma is a projection of who I am and what I want to do for the world.  I want to help create the next generation of forward thinking people.  I want to give the world the ability to come together to create positive energy.  May we live in relationship with one another and be united with one another, in one cause.  I am blessed. </p>
<h3><span>What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3>
<p><span>Starting a company and movement is no easy feat.  It takes a lot of time, energy, and funding.  Time and energy is in abundance, however funding is not.  We've accomplished so so much this far with little money.  I’ve put everything I’ve had into working on this vision however we’ve reached a point where we really need capital to help take this organization to the next level.  </span></p>
<p><span>Are biggest goal is this.  To have enough to make our message bearers of the world trek to the top of Mount Everest possible.  In order to make it possible there are all sorts of costs that have to be covered.  To start we have legal fees.  This includes business structure and permits.  Next there are office supplies.  We plan on having a lot of letters coming through our headquarters and there is a lot of mail that will be going out to our trekkers (message senders).  We have to mail out bracelets to each person who sends their letter.  With that being said there is a cost to produce each bracelet.  Once we send the letters to Nepal there is a bunch of shipping costs.  International ocean freight. ground transport from Calcutta to Katmandu, and then by foot to the base camp.  We will be taking a camera man with us along the journey as well.  Now those are some of the biggest expenses but there are many small ones as well such as having a landline, internet, and P.O. Box.  </span></p>

<h3><span>The Impact</span></h3>
<p><span>By contributing to our cause your helping us build a foundation for not only a organization but your helping to fund a grass roots movement to help change the world and shape the next generation of forward thinkers.</span></p>
<p><span>Its all about a mindset, a set of morals and ideals.  Most people have great ideas and intentions but fail to get there plan accepted on a large scale especially by younger populations becasue they dont have the cool factor.  I really think that we can help bring the important things in life forward by showing younger people hey it's awesome to help others, hey its cool to be friendly with everyone, no matter their social status, race, or ethnicity.  We as a society have made great strides but i still think there is work to be done.  MountKarma can help burn our path forward over the next decade and hopefully beyond.  </span></p>
<p><span>Our long term goal with mountkarma is to be a global force for change and good.  I see us as a sort of anti corporation.  A business that is about giving back.  Inspirational people that have helped inspire me have been Carl Sagan, The Dali Lama, Hayao Miyazaki, Duane Lee Chapman, and Felix Baumgratner.  </span></p>
<p><span>mountkarma is a unique blend of helping others and helping ourselves that makes our project so special.  On one hand your giving charity to someone in need to help them ahcieve there hopes and dreams.  On the other your sending a personal message on a spiritual journey.  whether that message is for a sick loved one, or because you yourself are stuggling, the idea behind this is to give people hope and inspiration.  its a means of release for some and a becon of hope for others.  its about creating postive karma.  </span></p>
<h3><span>Other Ways You Can Help</span></h3>
<p><span>Hey even if you cant afford to make a donation, its okay!  If you believe in our mission then tell your friends all about us.  Like us on facebook, follow us on twitter, instagram, tumbler, and youtube.  Letting people know this beautiful idea exists is one of the best things you can help us do.</span></p>

I grew up in the Northeastern United States, in the suburbs of Greenwich, Connecticut.  Something I haven’t always talked about is my background, so I would like to take a moment and share it with you.  Most people associate Greenwich with money and kids with spoons in their mouths however; this was not the case with me. 
I come from a small working class home in Pemberwick, a place they call HappyValley.  These are modest homes bordering Port Chester, New York.  While my friends were raised by their parents, I grew up being raised by my grandparents, Marcelle and Ritchie.  They are the most amazing people I know and let me tell you why. 
My whole life my mom has battled an addiction to drugs and alcohol.  She’s been in and out of prison more times then I can count or remember.  One of the first memories I have with her is being taught to ice skate out on the pond behind our house.  I will never forget that.  I have other memories that will never fade as well. 
I remember being taken into the Bronx and walking up a dark dusty staircase into a drab building to see my moms “friend.”  I’ll never forget the distinct smell of that place.  Opening the door into his apartment and walking through beaded passageways I was told to wait in the living room while they discussed business in the kitchen.  My intuition even at a young age of 8 told me something was wrong.  I went to look and was immediately turned away; things were quickly hidden from sight.  That evening while on our way home, I remember the red and blue lights penetrating the rear view window behind me.  The police officer came to the window and shined his flashlight into my eyes.  The next thing I remember was my mom being arrested.  These are the memories that I will keep with me until the day I die. 
I’m twenty-three now and my mom is still doing the same things and still making the same mistakes as she did 15 years ago.  I would like it very much to see my mom recover from her addictions so she can spend time with her family and get to know us.   For small periods of time she does. 
Recently, she got out of prison again after being there for seventeen months this past October of 2012.  I was so excited to see her, for a month I had my mom.  She had a probational requirement to wear a tracking bracelet and to be home at nine each night.  She was mandated to wear this for one month.  The day she got it off and left the house I was worried about her.  However I let it go because I thought she would be okay.  Two days later, on the day of Thanksgiving she never made it.  She never passed her urine exam; she hasn’t been the same since.  Cocaine or heroin… I don’t know. 
If not for my grandparents, who I call nanny and poppy (and still do), I don’t know where I would be or who I would be.  They helped raise me until I was 13 years old.  It was then that I went to live with my father.  When I moved to Stamford I was soo excited.  His home heating oil business was doing great.  He bought a nice big home in the back country of Stamford.  I was very proud of my dad and excited for this new start.  I may not have had my mom, but I had my dad.  I was looking to him for guidance however, I didn’t know that he too was struggling inside, struggling with a serious alcohol addiction.  One that has torn up our family and caused him to lose almost everything he’s ever gained.  His business, his home, and his family. 
It’s hard to see your parents or the people you love destroy themselves.  You want so badly to help them.  You want to look up to them and be guided through this crazy world.  Maybe that’s why I am who I am today.  That’s why I want to help people.  People who are struggling.  For me, it’s never been about social status, it’s never been about money, it’s been about being a good person.  At the end of the day, when you look at yourself in the mirror, what kind of person are you?  That has been the driving force for me.  A force for doing good, a force for success.  My background doesn’t make me weak, it makes me strong.  It’s my jet fuel to accomplish great things.  Mountkarma is a projection of who I am and what I want to do for the world.  I want to help create the next generation of forward thinking people.  I want to give the world the ability to come together to create positive energy.  May we live in relationship with one another and be united with one another, in one cause.  I am blessed. 
What We Need & What You Get
Starting a company and movement is no easy feat.  It takes a lot of time, energy, and funding.  Time and energy is in abundance, however funding is not.  We've accomplished so so much this far with little money.  I’ve put everything I’ve had into working on this vision however we’ve reached a point where we really need capital to help take this organization to the next level.  
Are biggest goal is this.  To have enough to make our message bearers of the world trek to the top of Mount Everest possible.  In order to make it possible there are all sorts of costs that have to be covered.  To start we have legal fees.  This includes business structure and permits.  Next there are office supplies.  We plan on having a lot of letters coming through our headquarters and there is a lot of mail that will be going out to our trekkers (message senders).  We have to mail out bracelets to each person who sends their letter.  With that being said there is a cost to produce each bracelet.  Once we send the letters to Nepal there is a bunch of shipping costs.  International ocean freight. ground transport from Calcutta to Katmandu, and then by foot to the base camp.  We will be taking a camera man with us along the journey as well.  Now those are some of the biggest expenses but there are many small ones as well such as having a landline, internet, and P.O. Box.

The Impact
By contributing to our cause your helping us build a foundation for not only a organization but your helping to fund a grass roots movement to help change the world and shape the next generation of forward thinkers.
Its all about a mindset, a set of morals and ideals.  Most people have great ideas and intentions but fail to get there plan accepted on a large scale especially by younger populations becasue they dont have the cool factor.  I really think that we can help bring the important things in life forward by showing younger people hey it's awesome to help others, hey its cool to be friendly with everyone, no matter their social status, race, or ethnicity.  We as a society have made great strides but i still think there is work to be done.  MountKarma can help burn our path forward over the next decade and hopefully beyond.  
Our long term goal with mountkarma is to be a global force for change and good.  I see us as a sort of anti corporation.  A business that is about giving back.  Inspirational people that have helped inspire me have been Carl Sagan, The Dali Lama, Hayao Miyazaki, Duane Lee Chapman, and Felix Baumgratner.  
mountkarma is a unique blend of helping others and helping ourselves that makes our project so special.  On one hand your giving charity to someone in need to help them ahcieve there hopes and dreams.  On the other your sending a personal message on a spiritual journey.  whether that message is for a sick loved one, or because you yourself are stuggling, the idea behind this is to give people hope and inspiration.  its a means of release for some and a becon of hope for others.  its about creating postive karma.

The Sparkr and Sparkr mini are unique, multi-functional tools that give you the power to create fire and light wherever your adventures may take you.    

The Sparkr has a windproof electric plasma lighter on one end and a flashlight / lantern on the other to make for one essential tool.
Fire Up No Matter The Occassion Regular ol’ butane lighters are riddled with problems - they don’t work well in the wind or when they’re wet, and they can run out of fuel without any warning. Have no fear, the Sparkr is here. Its high-intensity plasma lighter - which creates an electrical arc, rather than a flame - works in the wind, rain, and snow. The large 3,350 mAh rechargeable Li-Ion cell keeps it sparking for hundreds of uses. Safety FirstTo prevent any unwanted fires, the lighter also has a safety feature that requires you to press the button three times in a row before it will activate. The button is located near the head of the flashlight to keep your fingers away from whatever you're burning. Two Ways To Light Up Chances are, if you’re in need of a flame, you might also could use a light. That’s why we decided to combine the plasma lighter with a bright, high-efficiency LED flashlight.  The Sparkr puts up to 150 lumens of light in your hand, allowing you to confidently make your way through the dark. Choose from 3 brightness settings for a light that perfectly meets your needs. You can attach the translucent plasma lighter cap to the head of the flashlight to transform it into lantern you can hang or hold to evenly light up the space around you.Charge It On-The-Go

 

Twist the flashlight head to reveal the Micro USB charging portRather than the traditional flimsy micro USB port covers, we created a simple mechanism to keep your port free of dirt and dust. Just twist the head of the flashlight to reveal the micro USB charging port to easily juice up your Sparkr anywhere. Long Battery LifeThe large 3,350 mAh rechargeable lithium ion battery can power the Sparkr’s flashlight for up to 4 hours on high and 16 hours on low. When not in use, the battery can hold its charge for up to a year.Durable and Ergonomic The Sparkr was designed to be both a functional flashlight and lighter (for a full list of features, please scroll down to the ""Nitty Gritty"" section below).The Body is made of durable anodized aluminum. The lens body has an ergonomically molded thumb grip to ensure comfort when handling. The lighter cap is a quick twist and lock for both covering the plasma lighter and transforming the flashlight into a lantern.Two Color Options  Sparkr will be available in either the black or silver color schemes. All backers will chose the color of their choice after the campaign ends!  Does your precious pocket space belong to only the most useful and compact of tools? Don’t worry, we thought about you too. If you want a lot of utility in the smallest package possible, the Sparkr mini is for you. With a familiar shape and interface, it functions much like a traditional flip lighter, but it also has a built-in LED light on the bottom of the case that can be used as a flashlight. Fire Up In Style The Sparkr mini offers a classic look with improved function. It’s soft touch plastic provides a premium and durable feel. Plastic casing is ideal for a plasma lighter because it ensures that the plasma doesn’t arc to the case and become unreliable. It also allows the lighter to take a form that will feel good in your hand and your pocket. Safe, simple and sleek - this lighter will be sure to turn a few heads.A light when you need it most Never be caught in the dark again. The Sparkr mini is small enough to carry with you wherever you go. Anyone got a light? You do.An Everyday Carry The Sparkr mini is compact enough for a pocket but powerful enough to withstand the wind, rain or snow and light up your surroundings. Taking up minimal space in your pocket, purse or pack, this high power plasma lighter and flashlight is ready whenever you need it. No more worrying about running out of fuel - just charge it up while you sleep and you’re set for a few days.      (Above) David and Michael working on the 6 ft. custom built Tesla coil. (below) The Tesla coil firing some mad electricity!
 Over the years, we have dabbled in many geeky side projects. One of which really sparked the imagination of our team: building a 6ft. tall Tesla Coil. It took us months to build and we wanted to somehow incorporate it into a Power Practical product.  That’s when decided to turn our side project into work and thought to ourselves, ""why can’t we put one of these in everybody's pocket?""Brainstorming BeginsThe Power Practical team brainstorming over the design and functionality of the Sparkr.We wanted to make something that would be ideal for our adventures and for everyday use at home or work. After ordering and testing all the current solutions on the market, we started to narrow in on what we did and didn’t like about the products. We took all the lighters apart to see how we could make things more versatile and compact. After two weeks of rigorous testing and prototyping, we decided that we needed to make not one but TWO products with a similar feature set to fit our needs.Building the PrototypeMckay hard at work bringing the prototypes to life. After countless discussions, we started to get a brief idea of what features we wanted to include in the Sparkr and Sparkr mini. At this stage, our industrial designer started to mock up possible looks for the Sparkr and Sparkr mini.  After deciding on a specific look, the team set out to built a prototype. This took weeks of hard work and lots of time spent with foam models, clay, 3-d printers, paint, sandpaper, and electrical work.Putting the Prototype to the TestShots from our trip to the desert to test out the Sparkr, play on bikes, barbeque some good stuff, and play around with our previously kickstarted Luminoodle Basecamp LED Light Rope.We used the prototypes over a few weeks in real world scenarios from campfires to candles and had a great time while we did it! Thanks for taking the time to learn more about our new products and the story behind them. We wouldn't be here without the support of our AMAZING Kickstarter backers.Timeline",23.0,3,"3 Campaigns

<h1><b> WHAT'S THE STORY BEHIND IT?  </b></h1>
<p>A few years ago I discovered the fire piston and was fascinated by the fact that you could ignite tinder by compressing air. Being able to heat up air to over 600° F with one quick compression stroke immediately reminded me of all my physics classes I had in college and I had to learn more about it. I did some research and all the commercially available fire pistons were pretty large and bulky. I thought it would be pretty cool to turn a writing pen into a fire piston so that you could carry a reliable fire starting method with you every day without having to carry an extra device. Over the next few months I designed all the parts and pieces in my head, but I never brought my idea into CAD to fully detail it out. A few months ago I was reminded of my idea and discovered that no-one had made a writing pen into a fire piston, so I decided it was time to make it happen. Below are some photos of my journey in bringing the very first Triune Pen to life.</p>

<p align=""center"">  <strong>White Paper</strong></p>
<p>It has been proposed to use microwaves to beam down power to Earth from space based solar power stations in Geosynchronous Orbit.  However the Rayleigh diffraction limited optics requires enormous antennas, typically a few kilometers in diameter, and huge power levels, of 5GW to 10GW.   A much lower cost of entry investment (100x lower) is afforded by use of optical or infrared lasers with much shorter wavelength, hence much smaller system size, e.g. 10MW, with one meter size collimator mirror diameter. Since there is no ""grid power"" in space, most spacecraft today use solar power sources, mostly photovoltaic solar cells.  Powering lasers requires high levels of power. PV solar cells are usually less than 25% efficient.   This multiplied by a typical 20% “wall plug” efficiency of lasers results in overall a mere 5% efficiency (95% waste heat!).   This strongly motivates interest in solar pumping of lasers to greatly increase overall efficiency.  Theoretical efficiency of about 38% is possible.  Other potential benefits of solar pumped lasers would be reduced weight and reduced number of components affording higher reliability (reduced number of failure modes) versus an electrically pumped laser powered from PV cells.</p>
<p><strong>Space based solar power beaming would be most cheaply and efficiently performed using lasers with solar pumping, versus PV electrical pumping. </strong>High power and high efficient solar pumped lasers have a large potential for other applications, e.g. nano-materials production, materials processing, magnesium cycle of hydrogen production, free space laser communications, energy transmission. There recently was reported high-efficiency lasing (40% efficient, 300 mW) by using an advanced ceramic, Cr:Nd:YAG ceramic laser medium,  and an artificial solar-light pumping source.  This material lases at 1064 nanometres wavelength. This has opened up ample opportunities for creation of highly effective solar pumped lasers with wide range of powers, on the basis of different solar concentrators or Fresnel lenses, which in turn can promote occurrence of new environment-friendly laser technologies.</p>
<p>We propose the development of a pilot line of solar laser based laser research, development and use of high-effective solar pumped lasers taking advantages of the highly-sensitized Cr:Nd:YAG ceramic laser  mediums and the thin-disk laser technologies. To reach this challenging target, project partners will develop new high-efficient lasers, will research in parallel the most suitable architectures of solar lasers and cost-effective solar laser technologies, and will demonstrate space power beaming technology with solar powered lasers. </p>
<p>Solar lasers have been researched for 50 years with major emphasis on free space wireless optical communication and power transmission applications. Realization is now within reach with advanced ceramic laser materials. The innovation is the development of solar pumped lasers by combining advantages of the highly-sensitized Cr:Nd:YAG ceramic laser mediums (other than above mentioned active element of a rod-form with a low concentration of Cr3+ ions) and the thin-disk laser technologies.</p>
<p>If the efficiency of the laser pumped by solar light is 20%, in order to provide 200kW laser power there will be a need for 1MW of solar power which can be harvested from ~1250m2 at solar radiation intensity at the Earth surface ~800W/m2. In principle this can be realized with the lasers on large scale solar concentrators like the Uzbek big solar furnace (BSF), but from the practical point of view and also in order to meet the requirements such as low cost of equipment and quick return, it is preferable to build the laser-power station consisting of fiber bundle coupled lasers on small-scale parabolic concentrators. For instance a single laser module can be implemented on parabolic concentrator with a diameter of 1-2m.  In the case of 2m concentrator the solar power collected will be of about 2.5kW from which 500W laser power can be obtained at efficiency of 20%. So, in order to reach the power of 200kW there would be a need for 400 such laser modules.</p>
<p>Nanotechnology has made it possible to achieve high transparency, large-size, homogeneous solid state laser materials. The ceramic fabrication technology was a fundamental breakthrough for the  development of high-power laser applications. In particular, the wide opportunity has emerged for creation of the powerful and highly efficient solar pumped lasers. Recently, it was reported high-efficiency lasing (38% efficient) by using an advanced ceramic, Cr:Nd:YAG  ceramic laser medium, and a metal halide lamp as an artificial solar-light pumping source. However, the laser output was only 300mW level.</p>
<p>Combining advantages of the highly-sensitized Cr:Nd:YAG ceramic laser mediums (other than above mentioned active element of a rod-form with a low concentration of Cr3+ ions) and the thin-disk laser technologies could allow to reach high efficiency, close to the result obtained with artificial solar light at the laboratory conditions. This will be a major technology breakthrough.</p>
<p><br clear=""ALL""/> The principle investigator of this project will be Dr. Shermakhamat Payziyev.  He designed and fabricated the stand of the solar laser on the base of the Big Solar Furnace (BSF) at the Institute for Materials science of the Scientific and Production Association “Physics-Sun” (Uzbekistan). Using crystalline Nd3+:YAG rods his team demonstrated the possibility of utilization of 1 MW BSF for pumping purposes. Laser radiation power of 80W has been obtained from single Nd3+:YAG rod with working sizes of 6x130 mm installed in the multi-element secondary concentrator.</p>
<p>Another main result of these studies was the development of a computer model of the solar lasers which is based on ray-tracing and Monte-Carlo methods. The model makes calculations for lasers of a various configuration and active elements of the different form. Based upon experimental results and with use of the computer models there have been performed numerous calculations for different laser configurations. It was shown that the conversion efficiency of solar energy into the laser can be up to 25% of the solar flux energy collected at the focal area of BSF.</p>
<p>We propose to develop new high-efficient lasers, and to research in parallel the most suitable architectures of solar lasers and cost-effective solar laser technologies. Dr. Payziyev will relocate to Clarkson University in New York, USA where the research will be performed, under Leeward Space Foundation Research Fellowship.</p>

  White Paper
It has been proposed to use microwaves to beam down power to Earth from space based solar power stations in Geosynchronous Orbit.  However the Rayleigh diffraction limited optics requires enormous antennas, typically a few kilometers in diameter, and huge power levels, of 5GW to 10GW.   A much lower cost of entry investment (100x lower) is afforded by use of optical or infrared lasers with much shorter wavelength, hence much smaller system size, e.g. 10MW, with one meter size collimator mirror diameter. Since there is no ""grid power"" in space, most spacecraft today use solar power sources, mostly photovoltaic solar cells.  Powering lasers requires high levels of power. PV solar cells are usually less than 25% efficient.   This multiplied by a typical 20% “wall plug” efficiency of lasers results in overall a mere 5% efficiency (95% waste heat!).   This strongly motivates interest in solar pumping of lasers to greatly increase overall efficiency.  Theoretical efficiency of about 38% is possible.  Other potential benefits of solar pumped lasers would be reduced weight and reduced number of components affording higher reliability (reduced number of failure modes) versus an electrically pumped laser powered from PV cells.
Space based solar power beaming would be most cheaply and efficiently performed using lasers with solar pumping, versus PV electrical pumping. High power and high efficient solar pumped lasers have a large potential for other applications, e.g. nano-materials production, materials processing, magnesium cycle of hydrogen production, free space laser communications, energy transmission. There recently was reported high-efficiency lasing (40% efficient, 300 mW) by using an advanced ceramic, Cr:Nd:YAG ceramic laser medium,  and an artificial solar-light pumping source.  This material lases at 1064 nanometres wavelength. This has opened up ample opportunities for creation of highly effective solar pumped lasers with wide range of powers, on the basis of different solar concentrators or Fresnel lenses, which in turn can promote occurrence of new environment-friendly laser technologies.
We propose the development of a pilot line of solar laser based laser research, development and use of high-effective solar pumped lasers taking advantages of the highly-sensitized Cr:Nd:YAG ceramic laser  mediums and the thin-disk laser technologies. To reach this challenging target, project partners will develop new high-efficient lasers, will research in parallel the most suitable architectures of solar lasers and cost-effective solar laser technologies, and will demonstrate space power beaming technology with solar powered lasers. 
Solar lasers have been researched for 50 years with major emphasis on free space wireless optical communication and power transmission applications. Realization is now within reach with advanced ceramic laser materials. The innovation is the development of solar pumped lasers by combining advantages of the highly-sensitized Cr:Nd:YAG ceramic laser mediums (other than above mentioned active element of a rod-form with a low concentration of Cr3+ ions) and the thin-disk laser technologies.
If the efficiency of the laser pumped by solar light is 20%, in order to provide 200kW laser power there will be a need for 1MW of solar power which can be harvested from ~1250m2 at solar radiation intensity at the Earth surface ~800W/m2. In principle this can be realized with the lasers on large scale solar concentrators like the Uzbek big solar furnace (BSF), but from the practical point of view and also in order to meet the requirements such as low cost of equipment and quick return, it is preferable to build the laser-power station consisting of fiber bundle coupled lasers on small-scale parabolic concentrators. For instance a single laser module can be implemented on parabolic concentrator with a diameter of 1-2m.  In the case of 2m concentrator the solar power collected will be of about 2.5kW from which 500W laser power can be obtained at efficiency of 20%. So, in order to reach the power of 200kW there would be a need for 400 such laser modules.
Nanotechnology has made it possible to achieve high transparency, large-size, homogeneous solid state laser materials. The ceramic fabrication technology was a fundamental breakthrough for the  development of high-power laser applications. In particular, the wide opportunity has emerged for creation of the powerful and highly efficient solar pumped lasers. Recently, it was reported high-efficiency lasing (38% efficient) by using an advanced ceramic, Cr:Nd:YAG  ceramic laser medium, and a metal halide lamp as an artificial solar-light pumping source. However, the laser output was only 300mW level.
Combining advantages of the highly-sensitized Cr:Nd:YAG ceramic laser mediums (other than above mentioned active element of a rod-form with a low concentration of Cr3+ ions) and the thin-disk laser technologies could allow to reach high efficiency, close to the result obtained with artificial solar light at the laboratory conditions. This will be a major technology breakthrough.
 The principle investigator of this project will be Dr. Shermakhamat Payziyev.  He designed and fabricated the stand of the solar laser on the base of the Big Solar Furnace (BSF) at the Institute for Materials science of the Scientific and Production Association “Physics-Sun” (Uzbekistan). Using crystalline Nd3+:YAG rods his team demonstrated the possibility of utilization of 1 MW BSF for pumping purposes. Laser radiation power of 80W has been obtained from single Nd3+:YAG rod with working sizes of 6x130 mm installed in the multi-element secondary concentrator.
Another main result of these studies was the development of a computer model of the solar lasers which is based on ray-tracing and Monte-Carlo methods. The model makes calculations for lasers of a various configuration and active elements of the different form. Based upon experimental results and with use of the computer models there have been performed numerous calculations for different laser configurations. It was shown that the conversion efficiency of solar energy into the laser can be up to 25% of the solar flux energy collected at the focal area of BSF.
We propose to develop new high-efficient lasers, and to research in parallel the most suitable architectures of solar lasers and cost-effective solar laser technologies. Dr. Payziyev will relocate to Clarkson University in New York, USA where the research will be performed, under Leeward Space Foundation Research Fellowship.

About $600 will be for flights, and the other $1800 is for International Service Learning, the organization hosting my trip, which also covers meals, insurance, a home. They will also provide all the dental materials needed along with the dentists.

<h3>A photographic cycling journey<br/>
</h3>
<p>The past two months me (Bart) and my girlfriend (Mirjam) have been cycling from the dusty towns in Syria to Thessaloniki, Greece. In the next months we will be cycling through the majority of the Balkan countries. As a photographer I want to capture how I perceive the balkans showing culture, architecture and 'memories' from former Yugoslavia.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The goal of this project is to create a hardcover book and an exhibition in Holland. Staying at peoples homes I will be able to capture peoples visions on their societies, these stories will be a part of the book. In my photographic work I focus most on decay or the return of nature in urban spaces. This will therefore be an recurring theme in the book.</p>
<br/><p>The project video shows a slideshow of pictures I have made during the cycling trip, to give an idea about my photography style. Please visit our website to see more work: <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><a href=""http://www.leef-tijd.tk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.leef-tijd.tk</a></span></p>

</div><div>
<h3>The impact<br/>
</h3>
<p>When cycling the world is viewed differently; slower and closer to real life. Highways are evaded, small villages where real life happens become important destinations. Sleeping at local peoples homes creates an experience a a 'normal' tourist will never have.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The book and exhibition will show an artistic impression of the balkans. Hopefully it will inspire people to travel more by bicycle. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will need an estimate of 2200 dollars for this project. This accounts for the design and print of a hardcover book (number of copies will depend on donations) and the organisation of an exhibition. Furthermore I will be able to take some time to stay longer at locations when needed, since we are now travelling super low budget and have little financial room for 'delay'.</p>

<p>Of course, donations are rewarded with a gift. Check it out on the right side of the page.<br/></p>

<h3>Twisted Adventures was conceptualized by native Phoenicians and lifelong friends who have also done a fair amount of traveling. We have lived, raised our children and run our businesses here. We love Arizona! However, there are no amusement parks - and its the 5th largest city in the USA.</h3>
<div>We are also huge advocates for getting out and playing - not just sitting on a couch. We have done a lot of water sports, zip lining excursions and ropes challenges. One day, the question was asked ""Why can't this be done in Phoenix?"" And so, we set to work figuring out all the ""why nots""... and <em><strong>Twisted Adventures was born! Because it CAN Be Done, and It Will WORK!</strong> </em>
</div>
</div>
<div>Our Site is a Quarter of a Million Square Foot, Air Conditioned facility, sitting on 18 acres in Central Phoenix. It is all about spending your time with friends, family and like minded people that want challenge with their fun!<br/><br/>

<div>
<h2><strong><em>But FIRST, WE NEED YOU!</em></strong></h2>
</div>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>~~~</em></strong></p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We have strong interest from several investment groups for the full funding - the $12 Million part - but can't get full commitment without all of the results this next phase of due-diligence provides.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>The success of this campaign will also demonstrate just how much Phoenicians and Visitors to Arizona like to get out and do stuff and will come to Twisted Adventures!</em></strong></p>
<p>We need about a $130,000 to keep moving forward. We have a substantial amount of groundwork already completed. This includes a hold on our preferred site, zoning and city approval, preliminary engineering, and a commissioned study from ASU which validates the feasibility. So far, this has all been accomplished from our personal resources.</p>
<p>For any of you that know the industry, you'll be glad to hear we also have Larry Mackenzie - a highly experienced, Senior Executive from the Cedar Fair Entertainment Company (Six Flags) family of parks who built and managed amusement parks for over 35 years - ready to move to Phoenix, help us build it, run it and make it tons of fun and a huge success!</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>~~~</em></strong></p>
<h3>This Campaign is to get the design drafts from our architects, pay the accountants, the engineers, and the developers and consultants. A<strong>ll funding we receive will go immediately towards paying them. </strong>Here's the approximate breakdown:</h3>

Have kids - never fear! Twisted Adventures is designed to Thrill and Entertain All Ages from 2 - 99! And yet, this is no toddler free for all. We've conceptualized and designed it to be Individually Fun and Exciting, while Family Oriented and Challenging to All!
Still not sure? You did notice wake boarding / surfing right? How about the indoor snowpark? Ice climbing or snowboarding anyone? Maybe just a good 'ole fashioned snowball fight - in July.  Zorbs (just think human hamster balls). Not a BMX'er or a Skater? How about offroad Segway racing? You've seen Mall Cop right? We are stepping it up a notch!
 


 
Twisted Adventures was conceptualized by native Phoenicians and lifelong friends who have also done a fair amount of traveling. We have lived, raised our children and run our businesses here. We love Arizona! However, there are no amusement parks - and its the 5th largest city in the USA.
We are also huge advocates for getting out and playing - not just sitting on a couch. We have done a lot of water sports, zip lining excursions and ropes challenges. One day, the question was asked ""Why can't this be done in Phoenix?"" And so, we set to work figuring out all the ""why nots""... and Twisted Adventures was born! Because it CAN Be Done, and It Will WORK! 


Our Site is a Quarter of a Million Square Foot, Air Conditioned facility, sitting on 18 acres in Central Phoenix. It is all about spending your time with friends, family and like minded people that want challenge with their fun!


But FIRST, WE NEED YOU!

~~~
What We Need & What You Get
We have strong interest from several investment groups for the full funding - the $12 Million part - but can't get full commitment without all of the results this next phase of due-diligence provides.
The success of this campaign will also demonstrate just how much Phoenicians and Visitors to Arizona like to get out and do stuff and will come to Twisted Adventures!
We need about a $130,000 to keep moving forward. We have a substantial amount of groundwork already completed. This includes a hold on our preferred site, zoning and city approval, preliminary engineering, and a commissioned study from ASU which validates the feasibility. So far, this has all been accomplished from our personal resources.
For any of you that know the industry, you'll be glad to hear we also have Larry Mackenzie - a highly experienced, Senior Executive from the Cedar Fair Entertainment Company (Six Flags) family of parks who built and managed amusement parks for over 35 years - ready to move to Phoenix, help us build it, run it and make it tons of fun and a huge success!
~~~
This Campaign is to get the design drafts from our architects, pay the accountants, the engineers, and the developers and consultants. All funding we receive will go immediately towards paying them. Here's the approximate breakdown:
Engineers: $15,000.00; Ticketing Agency Consultation: $5,000.00; Architects: $21,000.00; Lighting / Scenery Design Drafts Deposit: $4,000.00; Accountants: $10,000.00; Property Valuation: $9,500.00; Attorneys: $10,000.00; City of Phoenix - Preliminary Design Draft Review and Licenses: $5,000.00; Project Hard Costs Estimator: $10,000.00; First Aid and Security Deposit for Site Specific Design: $10,000.00; Information Technology Site Specific Design Drafts: $10,000.00; Complete INDOOR Features Design Drafts: $15,000.00; Complete OUTDOOR Features Design Drafts: $8,000.00; Water Filtration / Reclamation Design Drafts: $5,000.00; Restaurant / Bar - Design and Estimates: $7,000.00.

By combining ultrasonic vibration and dual-direction turbo washing, Soaclean redefines portable cleaning.  All you need to do is just to turn it on and put in into water, and it will automatically clean for you.The dirt will be cleaned up in 3 minute arrangement. More efficient operation of Soaclean can save you time and money.Soclean is compact and lightweight, it’s easy to carry for your leisure or business trip.Soaclean uses a variety of cleaning methods, it has completely changed the washing technology. It can allow you to reach unprecedented cleanliness.Soaclean has the function of automatic washing.For example, your clothes will take 30 minutes to complete washing. However, for fruits and vegetables it only takes 5 minutes. What you need to do is just disconnect the power plug.Soaclean provides you with clean clothes anytime and anywhere. ""put in model"" design has a wider range of use. In the life there are articles that cannot be cleaned up with an ordinary washing machine or a dishwasher,Soaclean is perfect choice. With Soaclean, the ""Hand Wash Only"" label is no longer applicable.Soaclean produces modulated ultrasound, which cleans at micro level.Ultrasound carries the sound energy continuously into the water and detonates countless micron sized bubbles. Each bubble will cause an instantaneous high temperature of up to 1000 atmospheres, oscillation, emulsification, and stripping dirt.Do you remember the clothes that were damaged by traditional washing machine? With the latest technology  Soaclean is gentle to clothes, but troublesome for dirt. There is a function of imitating hand washing, it uses a rotating turbine to bring along a gentle flow of water to clean, to simultaneously conduct positive inversion.

It is an oscillating sound pressure wave whose operating frequency is beyond the human hearing range. In the water, these powerful waves create a process called cavitation that creates bubbles for cleaning. This technology has been used in medical and industrial fields for many years, which is a powerful cleaning way.  2.What is the steps for a complete washing?   A. Inject a certain amount of water into a clean container;   B. Put the stuff into the container.   C. Add the laundry liquid or powder.   D. Connect to the power supply.   E. After 30 minutes, unplug the power.  3.What is the size of the machine?The size of the machine is 130mm X 130mm X 53mm, so it is very portable.  4.What is the differences between the first generation product and Soaclean?A. It takes less time for a complete washing, which is 30 minutes.B. It consumes less power and its power automatically off after a 30-minute operation.C.

<b>
</b><p>After six years of working on this
project, I have experienced, witnessed and documented a huge variety of Indian weddings.</p>
<p>Being a foreigner in India can be
quite challenging at times, but it also has enormous advantages. As I traveled
throughout India, I was invited into sacred places and intimate moments
normally inaccessible to outsiders. The incredible array of stories I was able
to capture reveals cultures, traditions, and legacies as complex and diverse as
India herself.</p>

<p></p>
<b><b>WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT</b></b><p></p>
<p>The idea is to start a conversation.
Why? Because it’s an intriguing conversation to have. What we do is one thing.
How we do it is another. Wherever in the world we call home, we share rituals
similar in intention but unique in their expression. <i>Behind the Indian Veil</i> reveals the differences and similarities in Indian wedding traditions, while
seeking the common essence of this grand, colorful, fantastic celebration.
And in doing so takes us on a journey that in one way or another resonates with
us whether we’re Indian or not.</p>
<p>The book features images and stories
from a vast assortment of Indian communities such as Tamil Brahmin, Bengali, Sikh,
Hindu Punjabi, Hyderabadi Muslim, Rajput, Kashmiri Pandit, Ladakhi Buddhist,
Goan Catholic, Syrian Christian, Zoroastrian Parsi, Dawoodi Bhora, and Kodava
Coorg. </p>

<p><b>WHY ME</b><br/></p>
<br/><p>I am an established <a href=""http://www.sephi.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">documentary and travel photographer</a> with more than twenty-five years of experience. Before
relocating to India, I was a commercial photographer in Israel, where I
established a successful commercial photography studio and served as president
of the Professional Photographer’s Association.</p>
<p>My family and I moved to India more
than twelve years ago in search of somewhere to live our lives and fulfill our
dreams. From the moment we arrived, we felt at home. So we made it ours. I have
witnessed traditions buried so deep in the subconscious of the subcontinent
that even people from India don’t necessarily know about them.</p>
<p>It is here in India that my body of
work expanded into the most extraordinary places. My work has won awards and I have been published in international publications,
including <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, and <i>Condé Nast
Traveler</i>. My first book, <i><a href=""http://www.sephi.com/books/street-food-of-india/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Street Food of India</a></i>, received international
acclaim, including the Best Cookbook Photography 2010 award in the UK, a
nomination for Best in the World at the prestigious Gourmand Awards in Paris,
and was a favorite in <i>The New York Times</i> top ten best cookbooks of 2010.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>HOW YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE</b></p>
<p>Your participation enables me to
share traditions that may, one day, become so diluted they are lost forever.
Too many of these rituals from one of the oldest cultures in the world have
already become shortened into representations of what they used to be. </p>
<p>Your collaboration also works
towards empowering the self-publishing community. I learned so much from my
experience of having my first book – <i><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/behind-the-indian-veil-a-journey-through-weddings-in-india/www.sephi.com/books/street-food-of-india/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span></span></a><a href=""http://www.sephi.com/books/street-food-of-india/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Street Food of India</a></i> – published by a
publishing house here in India. The book, which won several international
awards, taught me about the complications of relationships between publishers
and artists, and that their different agendas don’t necessarily go hand in
hand.</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights have
always been a huge concern of mine. I want to be able to circumvent the often
limiting and discouraging complexities of this relationship and demonstrate that self-publishing is a desirable and viable option for
professional artists. I want to move towards being less dependent on mainstream
publishing and more towards putting the power of the photo back into the hands
of the photographer.</p>

<p><b>$42,000 SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY FOR PRINTING A BOOK. HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS FIGURE?</b></p>
<p>Here is what I wish to accomplish from this IndieGoGo campaign: I wish to make a beautiful book you could not get any other way than making a full print run. I promise to over deliver and make a product that will make everyone really happy. I do not not have a room full of books at home after I've fulfilled all the rewards. Have enough money to overcome unexpected obstacles that will surely come up along the way.</p>
<p>Book printing is expensive as a lump sum. Shipping books is even more expensive. My time and the time of people who I need to hire to help me is even more expensive than that. To add to that I would really want to surprise you with little extras here and there. This is all factored into the goal and includes a small buffer to enable some level of comfort in meeting those priorities above. In those terms, the goal isn't actually that high. I think of IndieGoGo as a way to make something much better than what I'd be able to do without your support. Reaching the goal will bring me to a position to do great things and you've already proven that when people care and want it can actually happen. I am so proud and honoured to have you with me on this journey.</p>

<p><b>THE JOURNEY</b></p>
<p>My six-year journey to define the
essence of an Indian wedding has been collaborative from the beginning. While
shooting a wedding in Madurai, a holy city in south India, a guest approached
me and asked if I had ever experienced a Syrian Christian wedding… and would I
like to come to Coimbatore right now to do so. I hopped on board and that first 133-mile trip snowballed into countless last minute tips and just as many spur-of-the-moment
trips to get that one more shot.</p>
<p>All the support and interest has
been astounding – I was welcomed into spaces I never expected to see in my
life. At one point I got caught sneaking shots at a mosque during a mass wedding of 319 Dawoodi Bhora couples in Mumbai. I was brought before the Mullah but Instead of kicking me out as I expected, he welcomed
me in and blessed me.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I know people feel my conviction and
the importance of this book’s cultural representation. They appreciate my
absolute dedication to capturing the essence of one of the most important days
of their lives. I feel their respect and gratitude towards me for taking
the time, as a foreigner, to learn so much about their culture and care so
deeply about their lives.</p>
<p>I end this amazing six-year journey
with more than 50,000 photos and experiences my imagination could never have
pictured. I begin a new one by stepping into self-publishing these poignant and
provocative stories, paying tribute to the couples and their loved ones, and
enabling future generations to witness the history that brought them to this
present.</p>

Even if I do not manage to raise the entire amount from this campaign your contribution will get me one step closer to the target. The book will be published but it will be easier with your support.
Your help and support means the world to me!
Thank
you so much,

WHAT’S SO UNIQUE

After six years of working on this
project, I have experienced, witnessed and documented a huge variety of Indian weddings.
Being a foreigner in India can be
quite challenging at times, but it also has enormous advantages. As I traveled
throughout India, I was invited into sacred places and intimate moments
normally inaccessible to outsiders. The incredible array of stories I was able
to capture reveals cultures, traditions, and legacies as complex and diverse as
India herself.

_____________________________________________________________________________
WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN FEATURED IN 


_____________________________________________________________________________








WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT
The idea is to start a conversation.
Why? Because it’s an intriguing conversation to have. What we do is one thing.
How we do it is another. Wherever in the world we call home, we share rituals
similar in intention but unique in their expression. Behind the Indian Veil reveals the differences and similarities in Indian wedding traditions, while
seeking the common essence of this grand, colorful, fantastic celebration.
And in doing so takes us on a journey that in one way or another resonates with
us whether we’re Indian or not.
The book features images and stories
from a vast assortment of Indian communities such as Tamil Brahmin, Bengali, Sikh,
Hindu Punjabi, Hyderabadi Muslim, Rajput, Kashmiri Pandit, Ladakhi Buddhist,
Goan Catholic, Syrian Christian, Zoroastrian Parsi, Dawoodi Bhora, and Kodava
Coorg. 


WHY ME
I am an established documentary and travel photographer with more than twenty-five years of experience. Before
relocating to India, I was a commercial photographer in Israel, where I
established a successful commercial photography studio and served as president
of the Professional Photographer’s Association.
My family and I moved to India more
than twelve years ago in search of somewhere to live our lives and fulfill our
dreams. From the moment we arrived, we felt at home. So we made it ours. I have
witnessed traditions buried so deep in the subconscious of the subcontinent
that even people from India don’t necessarily know about them.
It is here in India that my body of
work expanded into the most extraordinary places. My work has won awards and I have been published in international publications,
including The New York Times, The Guardian, and Condé Nast
Traveler. My first book, Street Food of India, received international
acclaim, including the Best Cookbook Photography 2010 award in the UK, a
nomination for Best in the World at the prestigious Gourmand Awards in Paris,
and was a favorite in The New York Times top ten best cookbooks of 2010.






HOW YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE
Your participation enables me to
share traditions that may, one day, become so diluted they are lost forever.
Too many of these rituals from one of the oldest cultures in the world have
already become shortened into representations of what they used to be. 
Your collaboration also works
towards empowering the self-publishing community. I learned so much from my
experience of having my first book – Street Food of India – published by a
publishing house here in India. The book, which won several international
awards, taught me about the complications of relationships between publishers
and artists, and that their different agendas don’t necessarily go hand in
hand.
Intellectual property rights have
always been a huge concern of mine. I want to be able to circumvent the often
limiting and discouraging complexities of this relationship and demonstrate that self-publishing is a desirable and viable option for
professional artists. I want to move towards being less dependent on mainstream
publishing and more towards putting the power of the photo back into the hands
of the photographer.













HOW MANY PAGES WILL THE BOOK BE?

The book is going to be size 10""x11"" with 144 pages and printed on high quality IRIS paper. The book itself will be available in high resolution PDF form and as high quality offset printed 10""x11"", 144 pages coffee table book. We will also have a limited casebound special edition. 



$42,000 SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY FOR PRINTING A BOOK. HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS FIGURE?
Here is what I wish to accomplish from this IndieGoGo campaign: I wish to make a beautiful book you could not get any other way than making a full print run. I promise to over deliver and make a product that will make everyone really happy. I do not not have a room full of books at home after I've fulfilled all the rewards. Have enough money to overcome unexpected obstacles that will surely come up along the way.
Book printing is expensive as a lump sum. Shipping books is even more expensive. My time and the time of people who I need to hire to help me is even more expensive than that. To add to that I would really want to surprise you with little extras here and there. This is all factored into the goal and includes a small buffer to enable some level of comfort in meeting those priorities above. In those terms, the goal isn't actually that high. I think of IndieGoGo as a way to make something much better than what I'd be able to do without your support. Reaching the goal will bring me to a position to do great things and you've already proven that when people care and want it can actually happen. I am so proud and honoured to have you with me on this journey.




EXCEEDING OUR GOAL
Exceeding our goal will enable me
to:

Hire an experienced writer for the narrative sections
     of the book
Engage a key public figure to write the foreword
Launch in New York City, London, Rome..?








THE JOURNEY
My six-year journey to define the
essence of an Indian wedding has been collaborative from the beginning. While
shooting a wedding in Madurai, a holy city in south India, a guest approached
me and asked if I had ever experienced a Syrian Christian wedding… and would I
like to come to Coimbatore right now to do so. I hopped on board and that first 133-mile trip snowballed into countless last minute tips and just as many spur-of-the-moment
trips to get that one more shot.
All the support and interest has
been astounding – I was welcomed into spaces I never expected to see in my
life. At one point I got caught sneaking shots at a mosque during a mass wedding of 319 Dawoodi Bhora couples in Mumbai. I was brought before the Mullah but Instead of kicking me out as I expected, he welcomed
me in and blessed me.







I know people feel my conviction and
the importance of this book’s cultural representation. They appreciate my
absolute dedication to capturing the essence of one of the most important days
of their lives. I feel their respect and gratitude towards me for taking
the time, as a foreigner, to learn so much about their culture and care so
deeply about their lives.
I end this amazing six-year journey
with more than 50,000 photos and experiences my imagination could never have
pictured. I begin a new one by stepping into self-publishing these poignant and
provocative stories, paying tribute to the couples and their loved ones, and
enabling future generations to witness the history that brought them to this
present.






Even if you can’t financially support the campaign
right now – no worries! You can also participate by passing along the link to anyone and everyone you know. Who knows who
they might know and where this part of the journey may lead :)
Much gratitude and many blessings,
Sephi

<h3>Idea</h3>
<p></p>We are the big fans of <b>man vs wild</b>. We always imagine what we should do it outdoor helpless situation. That why we always carry around many tools. However most of them is heavy weight and large in size, not easy for us to carry all around, an always seem like miss something. After years of searching we finally come up with this everyday carry survival kit. There are 15 handy tools in this collection. Each of them is small in size that you can carry everyday.  Let start to show you one by one.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Metal Case Flint</h3>

<p></p>
<p>This is our favorite one. It is alway cool to start a fire using flint. Metal case Flint is a extremely sturdy and reliable fire starting tool with a threaded aluminum case to protect the ferro rod. No worries about breaking the rod in your pocket with this setup. With a <br/>built in striker inside that will not <b>cut your pocket</b>. (We think it is dangerous to put a saw around you neck).The aluminum case can be a good self defense kubotan. Easy for self defense and break glass. In addition a small compass is attached to end of the case.  </p>

<p>This can turn any key into multi-tool. At less than a tenth-of-an-inch thick, the multi-tool key holder is the most unobtrusive bottle opener we've ever seen. The multi-functional tool is like a glove that fits around a standard house key and features, in addition to the useful bottle opener, three sizes of screwdriver, a nail file, a cutter, and tweezers. The stainless steel multi-tool key holder will hardly be noticeable in your pocket, but will inevitably come to your aid countless times for life's little emergencies. It is also help you easier to find your door key or any key with the holder on it. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>At LGBT Outdoors, we believe that nature is for everyone.  The peace, the exploration, the adventure - is available to anyone and everyone.  We want to smash the stereotypes that a) the great outdoors are only for the rugged... and b) that our LGBT Outdoors family is more than capable of conquering the wilderness in all its beautiful forms.</p>
<ul>
<li>We're creating a 4-part video series showcasing 4 different outdoor activities</li>
<li>Each film will feature the story of an outdoorsperson who is active with the featured activity</li>
<li>We aim to give you enough info in each episode so that you can go out and try it!</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you're into kayaking, rock climbing, cycling, fishing or any of the multitude of jaw-dropping outdoor experiences nature offers, we want to continue to grow to be a resource for the LGBTQ+ community to get out of the clubs - and get outdoors.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $16,000 for these 4 videos.</p>
<p>First - and importantly - <strong>our core team is volunteering their time and expertise</strong> for this passion project under this $16,000 for 4 videos goal.</p>
<p>When you watch high-quality video, most viewers never consider the herculean effort (and price tag), and large number of creative professionals it takes to make things happen.   Below is a list of our projected expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Videographers</li>
<li>Professional camera gear (and additional rentals when needed)</li>
<li>Travel \ transport \ lodging when necessary (though we're trying to keep at least 2 films local)</li>

<h3>The Core Team</h3>
<p>Justin Yoder, founder of LGBT Outdoors and lifelong outdoorsman is heading up this project as producer.  He's an award-winning photographer and is ridiculously passionate about creating these films.</p>
<p>Frank Darko is our director.  He's a top-notch filmmaker with a heavy background in art.  He brings with him years of documentary, corporate, and short-form filmmaking.</p>
<p>Patrick Thompson (husband of Justin Yoder) is LGBT Outdoors' Creative Director and resident film score composer.   With a masters certification from Berklee College of Music, his music has been on over 300 TV episodes of various shows.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many LGBTQ+ people have spent time ""in the closet""... unsure of things, if not downright afraid. We're going to show that LGBTQ+ people are strong enough - and resilient enough to fearlessly explore the outdoors... to ride that intimidating trail... to literally climb that mountain.</p>
<ul>
<li>We're going to show the immense strength of LGBTQ+ participants in hopes of inspiring others.</li>
<li>We'll encourage ALL people to get outside and marvel in the natural world.</li>
<li>Without being preachy, we will urge all outdoorspeople to responsibly and ethically enjoy nature's resources.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any creative venture, the ""stars"" need to align to a degree in order for things to work. We anticipate scheduling and timing to be one of our larger challenges - especially when nature is involved.  We can have all the gear and creative team lined up, but if weather is off... or the fish aren't biting... or the lake is too choppy... we can run into problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our production team is made up of creative professionals - problem solving is usually about 75% of what they do</li>

The mission...
Everest Base Camp, December 2014. To raise funding for Barbara Burrell Home for the Blind in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. 


Getting older...I don’t know about you, but when I think of growing old I
have hopeful visions of independent living, good health and mobility. Being
surrounded by my loved ones; husband, friends, my daughter and (God
willing) some grandkids!   Losing sight...

Barbara Burrell Home for the Blind... 


Specialist facilities are generally pretty poor here in Zim and
in many areas, non-existent. Barbara Burrell Home for the Blind is a small home coordinated by ordinary folk with the joint goal of caring for and making a difference in the lives of their residents. It serves to provide
comfort, recreation and rehabilitation for the elderly blind. This is where my beloved grandmother, Marj Muir, spent the last of her
years. 


Special lady...
Gran was rendered almost completely blind after a botched laser treatment. And her blindness was shortly followed by the greatest loss of all; the passing of her lifelong love - her husband, Jack. After that her health deteriorated rapidly and by the time she was admitted to Barbara Burrell a couple of years later, she was
also sadly in the deeper stages of Alzheimer’s and Dementia. 

She was a beautiful soul; with one of the most generous hearts

right to the finish line regardless of the difficulties that lay within her

  The objective...
In this light, on the 28th December I am headed to Nepal to take up the

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who I am?</h3>
<p>My name is Carla Geyser. I am an adventurer, conservationist, humanitarian and expedition leader of the 2018 <a href=""https://blueskysociety.org/journeys-with-purpose"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><i>Rise of the Matriarch Expedition</i></strong></a>. A few years ago I started the <a href=""http://www.blueskysociety.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blue Sky Society Trust</a> – an organisation committed to making a meaningful difference in wildlife and conservation here in Africa. I have spent the past six years travelling extensively through the continent, helping better lives of people in need and doing my bit to protect our beautiful animals.</p>
<p> I believe that every act of kindness can have a positive ripple effect and even the smallest contribution can make a big difference. I believe that one person can bring about significant, positive change and I want to be that person. I believe that if we all join hands and put on a united front, we can make sure that the next generation, and the one after that and after that, will enjoy all the natural magnificence that “Mama Africa” has to offer. </p>
<p><strong>50 days. 4 countries. 9000 km. One important mission.</strong></p>
<p>In September 2018, I will lead an all-women South African expedition on a conservation mission to raise awareness about human-wildlife conflict. It’s a sensitive issue and one of the main threats to the continued survival of many species here in Africa. It’s also a significant threat to local communities who live in close proximity to wildlife. It’s absolutely crucial to educate these communities as their support is essential for conservation efforts.</p>
</div><div>
<p>This is what <strong><i>Journeys with Purpose: Rise of the Matriarch</i></strong> expedition will set out to achieve when we travel across South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The <i>Journeys with Purpose</i> mission attracted substantial media attention in Africa two years ago, when I headed up South Africa’s first all-female expedition from the tip of Southern Africa to Kenya to help stem the tide of poaching. There were 13 “conservation trailblazers” on the team and we raised nearly R300 000 for various conservation projects, drew widespread continental attention to elephant poaching crisis, distributed 20 000 conservation educational booklets to children and provided support to 37 wildlife organisations along the way.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VwWsGi0vJ_U?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Now, we are planning to harness the same passion and purpose to make a difference combining adventure travel with ecotourism fundraising.</p>
<p>Here in Africa, we are losing an average of 30 000 elephants a year. That’s about one every 15-25 minutes. But the situation is far more grim. Every single day, two conservation heroes – game rangers – are killed as are three rhinos and countless pangolin.  A few months back, we lost the world’s last Northern White Rhino.</p>
<p>Human-wildlife conflict plays as big a role in this crisis as poaching.  </p>
<p>Our conservationists grapple this issue on a daily basis as they seek to educate the youth about conservation and in the process empower communities with skills needed to reduce human-wildlife conflict.</p>
<p>The <strong><i>Journeys with Purpose: Rise of the Matriarch</i></strong> expedition will spend nearly two months visiting communities at a grassroots level, using knowledge to educate and empower, with the aim of protecting parties on either side of the human-wildlife divide. We have 30 000 booklets to distribute that explain ways to minimise this conflict so people and animals can live in harmony, side-by-side. We will connect with anti-poaching groups, visit conservation bodies and schools, and meet with incredible women who are doing remarkable things at a micro-community level to assist in conservation efforts.</p>
<p>The funds we raise will benefit four causes: <a href=""http://elephantsalive.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elephants Alive</a> (South Africa), <a href=""http://www.restnamibia.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rare and Endangered Species Trust </a>(Namibia), <a href=""http://www.ecoexistproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eco-Exist Project</a> (Botswana) and the <a href=""http://softfootalliance.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Soft Foot Alliance Trust</a> (Zimbabwe).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533795517/fvkwl5tfavdsom3wfhw4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Yes, it is a mammoth task and I understand what we can’t do it alone. I would really appreciate your help in helping us help our animals here in Africa. Every little bit counts.</p>
<p>I would like to raise over R150 000 from this campaign. (Approx $12000). Each of the women “she-roes” on this expedition is paying their own way. But a journey of this magnitude costs a lot of money. I want <strong>50%</strong> of the fundraising to go towards paying for some of these expedition expenses; the remaining <strong>50%</strong> will be donated to the four nominated beneficiaries. Except for expedition crew perks (all that will go towards covering expenses) </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Some of the expedition costs include:-</strong></p>
<p><strong>R50 000</strong> for PR and Media releases (so more people around the world are aware of the human-wildlife crisis and will get involved in finding long-term solutions)</p>
<p><strong>R90 000 </strong>to film the expedition for 20 days, (1 x camera person) to cover logistical expenses. This excludes equipment hire, logistics, insurance and fee.</p>
<p><strong>R50 000</strong> post production fee to produce a sizzler reel and 30 x minute film on the expedition</p>
<p><strong>R14 000</strong> for branding two x expedition vehicles</p>
<p><strong>R40 000 </strong>for 3 month digital + marketing campaign + media monitoring</p>
<p><strong>R50 000</strong> for insurance, medi-vac, passenger liability, public liability  etc to keep us safe on the road</p>
<p><strong>R36 000 </strong>for fuel (2 x vehicles) - this is a estimated value, as we all know fuel is sky high at the moment. </p>
<p><strong>R80 000</strong> for 2<sup>nd</sup> car hire (1 x vehicle) for 50 days.</p>
<p><strong>R10 000</strong> for website updates</p>
<p>*NB: <strong>R25 000</strong> to buy a 'sunbox' mini projector - which is a movie case that is powered off solar,  that we want to use in rural communities to show them videos of conservation projects. A brilliant way to re-connect them with nature. One of the movies we will be showing is called 'Sisters of the Wilderness', which has just won the best SA documentary at the Durban International Film festival.  You can watch the trailer by watching the below video </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Me-m3caeh4U?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>So as you can see there are <strong>MANY</strong> costs we are trying to cover. So any donation will be greatly appreciated.  Below is an example of what the sunbox by Sunshine cinema looks like. Its an INCREDIBLE opportunity to show videos in rural areas that are affected by Human Wildlife conflict. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533795078/ncvaj6ni2ppkgei2rnpd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>THESE ARE THE CONSERVATION WARRIORS WE WILL BE SUPPORTING:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The Eco-Exist Project in Botswana </li>
<li>The Elephants Alive organisation in South Africa </li>
<li>The Soft Foot Alliance Trust in Zimbabwe </li>
<li>The Rare and Endangered Species Trust (REST) in Namibia </li>
</ol>
<p>A journey of this nature requires more than meticulous planning and a dedicated crew. It requires a combined effort of like-minded people who are committed to doing their bit, however little, to save our precious planet, one conservation crisis at a time. It’s not too late to get involved.</p>

<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>There’s no doubt that millions of ordinary people, like you and I, are gravely concerned about the state of our planet and all the precious life on it. But if we stop there – voicing our fears and articulating our anxieties – we will be no different that those who simply turn a blind eye. The future of Earth depends on decisive action. Now. Not later. But right now. We sadly do not have the luxury of time anymore.</p>
<p>Anything you contribute to the <strong><i>Journeys with Purpose: Rise of the Matriarch</i></strong> expedition will be turned into immediate action points. No time-lapse. No red-tape. No waiting. The planning is done and we will be heading out in September to educate, conserve and fundraise, with whatever little is in our expedition kitty. We will set out with noble hearts to achieve what appears to be impossible. But if there is one thing I have learned during my two decades in conservation, is that as more people come on board, the less insurmountable SOS missions like this are.</p>
<p>Humanity has done a fine job in extending the wildlife extinction list. It’s time we take collective, decisive action to remedy that. Please help us make this journey all the more worthwhile.</p>
<p>In 2016, we celebrated the success of our <a href=""http://www.elephantignite.co.za"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Journeys with Purpose: </i><i>Elephant Ignite Expedition</i></a>. Back then, we spent 100 days travelling across 10 African countries turning the spotlight on the continent’s elephant poaching crisis.</p>
<p>At the end of the 16 000km journey, we had created sufficient “noise” about the dire situation (in the last decade, Central Africa has lost 64% of its elephant population) to mobilise communities to take a stand against poaching.</p>
<p>We also raised nearly R300 000 which we donated to various anti-poaching units. We attracted R6 million in media coverage, thankfully drawing attention to what we set out to do, spurring on more individuals and corporates to get involved in the frontline fight to protect our elephants.</p>
<p>We are determined to do the same now, replicating the Courage, Hope and Love that ignited the first all-women expedition, to address the critical human-wildlife conflict.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>A journey of this magnitude and purpose isn’t without challenges and risks. It’s a daily emotional rollercoaster: setting up camp, driving long distances, cooking and cleaning chores, dealing with the impact of hearing devastating stories about wildlife failures and the adrenaline of listening to those that speak of successes.</p>
<p>All expedition members are aware of this. It’s about heading out with the correct mind-set and being open to all that Mama Africa throws our way. There will be no on-journey support team; no-one to help us if we get stuck in a ditch (it happens more often than you think) or if we fall ill (we will, most often, be miles away from medical help), or if something goes wrong with our 4x4 vehicles or if we feel physically unsafe.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest challenge is funding. The more we raise, the more of impact we can make. As much as my team and I are passionate about the mission, we can’t get by on positivity and passion alone.</p>
<p>While this is my second all-women expedition into Africa, I have been involved in numerous conservation journeys in the continent over the past two decades. I know what is required, the challenges of embarking on a journey of this kind, and more importantly, how to deal with issues when they arise. I have also led two other major expeditions in 2014, and 2016 for Dtours. One being 61 people in 2014 , and the other 83 in 2016. Also a fundraising journey introducing and reconnecting foreigners to Mama Africa. </p>
<p>As expedition leader, I have fantastic on-the-ground support in the countries/areas we are visiting. I have been in contact with key stakeholders for the past few months, alerting them of the expedition and securing their support should anything go wrong from a logistics and operational point of view.</p>
<p>My back-end support team, while based in South Africa, is connected with senior conservation officials in each country so there is a clear line of communication in the event of a crisis that we can’t address by ourselves on the ground.</p>
<p>I am also trained in first-aid, know how to change a flat tyre, and have all the equipment needed if our vehicles get stuck.</p>
<p>All women team members are aware that “camp chores” such as cooking, cleaning, driving and packing up, will be shared .</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Who I am?
My name is Carla Geyser. I am an adventurer, conservationist, humanitarian and expedition leader of the 2018 Rise of the Matriarch Expedition. A few years ago I started the Blue Sky Society Trust – an organisation committed to making a meaningful difference in wildlife and conservation here in Africa. I have spent the past six years travelling extensively through the continent, helping better lives of people in need and doing my bit to protect our beautiful animals.
 I believe that every act of kindness can have a positive ripple effect and even the smallest contribution can make a big difference. I believe that one person can bring about significant, positive change and I want to be that person. I believe that if we all join hands and put on a united front, we can make sure that the next generation, and the one after that and after that, will enjoy all the natural magnificence that “Mama Africa” has to offer. 
50 days. 4 countries. 9000 km. One important mission.
In September 2018, I will lead an all-women South African expedition on a conservation mission to raise awareness about human-wildlife conflict. It’s a sensitive issue and one of the main threats to the continued survival of many species here in Africa. It’s also a significant threat to local communities who live in close proximity to wildlife. It’s absolutely crucial to educate these communities as their support is essential for conservation efforts.

This is what Journeys with Purpose: Rise of the Matriarch expedition will set out to achieve when we travel across South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe.
The Journeys with Purpose mission attracted substantial media attention in Africa two years ago, when I headed up South Africa’s first all-female expedition from the tip of Southern Africa to Kenya to help stem the tide of poaching. There were 13 “conservation trailblazers” on the team and we raised nearly R300 000 for various conservation projects, drew widespread continental attention to elephant poaching crisis, distributed 20 000 conservation educational booklets to children and provided support to 37 wildlife organisations along the way.

Now, we are planning to harness the same passion and purpose to make a difference combining adventure travel with ecotourism fundraising.
Here in Africa, we are losing an average of 30 000 elephants a year. That’s about one every 15-25 minutes. But the situation is far more grim. Every single day, two conservation heroes – game rangers – are killed as are three rhinos and countless pangolin.  A few months back, we lost the world’s last Northern White Rhino.
Human-wildlife conflict plays as big a role in this crisis as poaching.  
Our conservationists grapple this issue on a daily basis as they seek to educate the youth about conservation and in the process empower communities with skills needed to reduce human-wildlife conflict.
The Journeys with Purpose: Rise of the Matriarch expedition will spend nearly two months visiting communities at a grassroots level, using knowledge to educate and empower, with the aim of protecting parties on either side of the human-wildlife divide. We have 30 000 booklets to distribute that explain ways to minimise this conflict so people and animals can live in harmony, side-by-side. We will connect with anti-poaching groups, visit conservation bodies and schools, and meet with incredible women who are doing remarkable things at a micro-community level to assist in conservation efforts.
The funds we raise will benefit four causes: Elephants Alive (South Africa), Rare and Endangered Species Trust (Namibia), Eco-Exist Project (Botswana) and the Soft Foot Alliance Trust (Zimbabwe).

Yes, it is a mammoth task and I understand what we can’t do it alone. I would really appreciate your help in helping us help our animals here in Africa. Every little bit counts.
I would like to raise over R150 000 from this campaign. (Approx $12000). Each of the women “she-roes” on this expedition is paying their own way. But a journey of this magnitude costs a lot of money. I want 50% of the fundraising to go towards paying for some of these expedition expenses; the remaining 50% will be donated to the four nominated beneficiaries. Except for expedition crew perks (all that will go towards covering expenses) 

Some of the expedition costs include:-
R50 000 for PR and Media releases (so more people around the world are aware of the human-wildlife crisis and will get involved in finding long-term solutions)
R90 000 to film the expedition for 20 days, (1 x camera person) to cover logistical expenses. This excludes equipment hire, logistics, insurance and fee.
R50 000 post production fee to produce a sizzler reel and 30 x minute film on the expedition
R14 000 for branding two x expedition vehicles
R40 000 for 3 month digital + marketing campaign + media monitoring
R50 000 for insurance, medi-vac, passenger liability, public liability  etc to keep us safe on the road
R36 000 for fuel (2 x vehicles) - this is a estimated value, as we all know fuel is sky high at the moment. 
R80 000 for 2nd car hire (1 x vehicle) for 50 days.
R10 000 for website updates
*NB: R25 000 to buy a 'sunbox' mini projector - which is a movie case that is powered off solar,  that we want to use in rural communities to show them videos of conservation projects. A brilliant way to re-connect them with nature. One of the movies we will be showing is called 'Sisters of the Wilderness', which has just won the best SA documentary at the Durban International Film festival.  You can watch the trailer by watching the below video 

So as you can see there are MANY costs we are trying to cover. So any donation will be greatly appreciated.  Below is an example of what the sunbox by Sunshine cinema looks like. Its an INCREDIBLE opportunity to show videos in rural areas that are affected by Human Wildlife conflict. 

THESE ARE THE CONSERVATION WARRIORS WE WILL BE SUPPORTING:

The Eco-Exist Project in Botswana 
The Elephants Alive organisation in South Africa 
The Soft Foot Alliance Trust in Zimbabwe 
The Rare and Endangered Species Trust (REST) in Namibia 

A journey of this nature requires more than meticulous planning and a dedicated crew. It requires a combined effort of like-minded people who are committed to doing their bit, however little, to save our precious planet, one conservation crisis at a time. It’s not too late to get involved.
Whatever we raise, will be split 50/50. Half will be used to fund the expedition and the other half will be donated to the four nominated beneficiaries: Elephants Alive (South Africa), Rare and Endangered Species Trust (Namibia), Eco-Exist Project (Botswana) and the Soft Foot Alliance Trust (Zimbabwe).

THE IMPACT
There’s no doubt that millions of ordinary people, like you and I, are gravely concerned about the state of our planet and all the precious life on it. But if we stop there – voicing our fears and articulating our anxieties – we will be no different that those who simply turn a blind eye. The future of Earth depends on decisive action. Now. Not later. But right now. We sadly do not have the luxury of time anymore.

</div><h2><br/></h2><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>","Here's the IdeaHave you ever had a couple of friends over who wanted to play beer pong and didn't want to move furniture around to set up a table?  Or maybe you thought beer pong was a great idea while out at a tailgate party but needed the table space for food and drinks.  We have been there and that's why we invented Oche Pong over two and half years ago.  Since then we have worked with various design, prototype, and manufacturing companies to provide you with what we feel is an exceptional product in both quality and gameplay.We are already into productionOche Pong officially went into production on July 9th, 2015.  We have paid over $10k for the molds required to create Oche Pong..  We also have the funds covered for the initial minimum order quantity required by the manufacturer.  In order to get Oche Pong into everyone hands as early as possible we decided to come to Indiegogo for the last bit of funding we need in order to cover some final transportation and packaging costs.Our manufacturer has notified us that they should have production samples for us to approve at the end of August.  We will verify that they are truly the quality that we want to provide for you then we will approve the first order of Oche Pong boards.  They should arrive late November which will give us time to ship them out to you in time for holiday and New Year's Eve parties.To get Oche Pong onto the walls, windows, and tailgate tents we have postponed the development of the the feet attachments until early 2016.  If you decide to help a couple of guys out in this campaign we will provide a coupon code for you for each board that is ordered to receive the feet at a 70% off rate when they are available.How To Play?Oche Pong can be played with either one or two boards.  A two board game is similar to regular table played beer pong without the table of course. With one board you can simply take turns shooting two balls at the cups with most of your normal house beer pong rules.  The first one to eliminate 6 cups is the winner.   If there is a 5 to 5 tie then set up an extra 3 cup playoff at the bottom of the board.   We have also played using two different color or team marked cups on the single board.  Sink a shot into your own team's cup and you drink and lose it.  We have even played with three different color cups and used the center middle one as a social where everyone indulges a bit when a shot is sunk.This is just us having fun.  As with normal beer pong we know that various house rules and games will develop as the game is grown.Big Thanks to our Friends at:",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We have decided 
to offer also classic UNCO Vest. The vest has no sleeves and no hood. 
Its manufacturing require slightly less labor than jacket. Needless to 
say, it uses fewer materials and accessories. Therefore the price of the
 UNCO Vest can be lower.<br/><br/></p>

<h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 128, 0);"">The Pain</span></h3>

  We love to travel, explore and stay close to the nature, but first of all we are the photographers. Many times we had to carry our cameras, backpacks and other heavy equipment throughout the day. <span>
  We believe that this sounds familiar to many of you</span>.  <strong><span style=""color: rgb(178, 34, 34);"">You know the pain !</span>
<br/><p></p></strong>We have used and tested many different jackets and vests. Some of them were branded and expensive, others not but <i>none of them ever fulfilled all our expectations and needs as <em>the travellers, outdoorsmen and</em> photographers. </i><br/><br/><b><span style=""color: rgb(178, 34, 34);"">Why jackets and vests do not meet our requirements?</span></b><br/><p></p>
These are the most important reasons:<br/>
<span><i>
<ul>
<li>The vast majority of jackets can not be easily converted into a vest.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<span>Most jacket</span>s don't protect at all our backs, necks and shoulders against harmful and painful pressure caused by the straps. Other jackets and vests don't <span>provide sufficient protection</span>.</li>
<li>
The vast majority of jackets is not made from organic performance cotton. <br/>
</li>
<li>
Some jackets are not weatherproof.<span> And in turn, weatherproof jackets do not provide sufficient breathability</span>.<span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Weatherproof jackets are often made of synthetic performance fabrics and contain various chemical agents (ie PFC) providing water repellency.<br/>In both cases they </span>emit harmful chemical substances.</li>
<li>Most of the synthetic performance fabrics have limited durability and don't maintain its properties over the years.</li>
<li>
<span>Many jackets and vests do not have enough number of pockets, however, a few has too many</span>. You don't need 42 pockets, do you ?<br/>
</li>
<li>
<span>Most jackets have pockets which are not tailored to the needs of the traveler or photographer</span>. <span>In most cases hand-warming pockets do not really warm hands, cargo pockets are too small and pockets for glasses are annoying or do not exist. <br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Most of the jackets don't have dedicated pockets for bottles</span>. <br/>
</li>
<li>Many jackets <span>are too long and thus un</span>convenient while sitting, crouching or driving, when the lower pockets are filled with stuff.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</i></span>
<span>
<div>
<span>I can enumerate further and further. It is <b>annoying and very, very frustrating</b>.<br/>We have learned to live with. Unfortunately, often after years of this <span>discomfort</span> one has <b>various health problems</b>. <span>For example</span> with a back or a neck, and so forth.<br/><br/></span>
</div>
<h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 128, 0);"">The Remedy</span></h3></span> Out of this pain and frustration, Tomasz has dreamed of how to <strong>improve the design </strong>of jacket or vest to make it compatible with our<strong> </strong>and Yours requirements and free us from this frustration and pain.<span> </span>That’s how the UNCO was born.<strong><br/></strong><span>In recent months </span>Tomasz rethought and verified his ideas. <span><span>These ideas immediately appealed to me, our family, friends and colleagues</span></span>, so we have invested a lot of effort and money in the design of the jacket as well as experimenting and testing<strong> </strong>different solutions and materials. The design philosophy was simple: UNCO CONCEPTS products are to be top performance - <strong>tough, functional, versatile and comfortable</strong>. <br/><strong><br/><span style=""color: rgb(178, 34, 34);"">The result is a unique jacket that is a combination of organic cotton fabric with highly effective padding inserts that protect the back, neck and shoulders and functionality tailored to the specific needs of outdoorsmen.</span></strong><br/><br/>In the recent months we have started collaborating with a professional company specializing in the apparel product development and pre-production of clothing.  <span>This company works with large manufacturers and well-known designers of clothing</span>. Subsequently, in close co-operation with this company, we have developed several early prototypes. Now we have in our hands three pre-production samples of UNCO Jacket and Vest and we are <b><span style=""color: rgb(178, 34, 34);"">ready to deploy production.</span>
</b><br/><br/>However, we continue testing the jacket and work on further improvements. <span>Currently planned changes include some improvements of pockets and flaps, as well as change of zippers and improvement of sleeve cuffs</span>.<br/>We will also appreciate your suggestions on how to improve our jacket.<br/>Our final product will surely be even better. <br/><br/><h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 128, 0);"">The UNCO Jacket and Vest</span></h3>
<b><span style=""color: rgb(178, 34, 34);"">Why UNCO is compatible with our requirements?</span></b><br/><p></p>These are the most important reasons:<br/><ul>
<li><i>UNCO can be easily converted into a Vest, hence UNCO Jacket and Vest.</i></li>
<li>
<i><i><i>UNCO</i>, <span>thanks to a specially designed inserts made ​​of perforated Neoprene 8mm and 3mm</span> </i> provides very effective protection of the back, neck and shoulders.</i>
</li>
<li>
<i><i><i><i>UNCO</i>  </i></i>is made of a premium EtaProof 100% organic cotton fabric</i>.<br/>
</li>
<li><i><i><i><i><i><i>UNCO</i>  </i></i>is naturally </i>weatherproof - it withstands rainfall and keeps out all but very heavy and persistent rain, and creates an effective barrier guarding you from a wind chill.<br/></i></i></li>
<li><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i>UNCO</i>  </i></i></i></i></i> maintains extremely high </i><i>breathability. A <span>very high rate of transpiration of moisture guarantees the comfort with high physical activity</span></i>. <br/></i></li>
<li><i><i><i><i><i>UNCO, made of </i></i></i><i><i>pure o<i>rganic cotton, </i><i><i>does not use PFC</i> or other harmful chemical agents </i>to achieve water repellency</i> hence, </i></i>its Fluorcarbon free (RUC).</i></li>
<li><i><i><i><i><i><i>UNCO,</i></i> made of </i><i>EtaProof</i>, is very durable and maintains its properties over the years. It develops a lovely distressed patina of age with use!</i></i></i></li>
<li><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i>UNCO</i></i></i></i> is sustainable</i> - its made of renewable, organically produced cotton</i>.<br/></i></i></i></li>
<li><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i>UNCO</i></i></i></i></i></i> </i></i></i>has <span>16 pockets of different sizes <span>and tailored to the different needs and appropriately disposed</span>.</span></i></i></i></i></li>
<li><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i>UNCO</i></i></i></i></i></i>  </i></i></i></i></i></i></i> is also a bit shorter than most of the jackets to make it more convenient while sitting, crouching or driving.<br/></i></i></i></i></li>
</ul>
<br/><h3> <span><strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 128, 0);"">We are very proud of the product we have created !</span></strong></span>
</h3>
 All the materials and accessories used are produced in Europe - in Switzerland, Germany, and UK. And the UNCO will be manufactured (sewn) in EU.  Our jacket - starting from its design, protective functions, comfortability, versatility and exclusive pure organic cotton fabric,<strong> </strong>through the best sliders, accessories and Neoprene inserts for superior performance - is a <strong>product of the highest quality</strong>. <br/><br/><strong><span style=""color: rgb(178, 34, 34);"">We believe that the quality and functional product will meet your interest !  </span></strong>This is why we came to the conclusion that it is worthwhile to start production of UNCO Jacket and Vest.<br/><br/>

Switzerland. History has it that during the World War II this cloth has been used by British RAF to manufacture fighter pilots' immersion suites. They proved to be very comfortable to wear in the cockpit under combat conditions and thanks to their high water tightness and thermal insulation properties saved lifes of many pilots keeping them warm and dry for long enough to enable them to be rescued.<br/><br/>After the war these fabrics continued to be used for the air force, the navy and the special forces. Designs have changed over the years but you can still find suits made of this performance cotton in modern jets with the RAF and other NATO airforces.  Stotz &amp; Co. AG, has been weaving such 
special dense cotton fabrics for the Mininstry of Defence (MoD) in Scandinavia and the USA since the 1960's, and since 1990' also for the British MoD. These fabrics were also used by many arctic and mountaineering expeditions, and earned a well-deserved reputation among fans of Bushcraft.<br/><br/>Now, when we are a bit disappointed with the modern synthetic technical fabrics, these unique high performance cotton textile is seeing quite the renaissance and is increasingly being used by luxury and upmarket brands to produce exclusive lines of every day 
jackets and coats. </i><b><a href=""http://www.stotzfabrics.ch/outdoorstoffe/outdoorstoffe_en.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Read more about History of this unique cotton.</a> </b><br/><br/>

In order to make the main page more perspicuous we have mooved the description of some perks to Update tab - UPDATES. You can find those perks in Update 8.All perks are also visible on the right side of this page.

Perks - UNCO Jacket and Vest

We have decided 
to offer also classic UNCO Vest. The vest has no sleeves and no hood. 
Its manufacturing require slightly less labor than jacket. Needless to 
say, it uses fewer materials and accessories. Therefore the price of the
 UNCO Vest can be lower.


In addition, we have also prepared special B2B Retailer's Packs, which offers an additional discount and lower shipping cost.





Sizing and ColoursYou can find below the range of proposed sizes of the UNCO Jacket and Vest. Both the jacket and vest allow you to significantly adjust their size, especially in the chest and hip. We hope that thanks to your support we will be able to offer very soon also S and XXL sizes.
You can find below the range of proposed colours. Recently we have decided to add the fourth colour - Anthracite.  We also hope that soon we will be able to offer another one - Olive.







Please be aware that hues of colours displayed may vary slightly depending on the Internet browser, monitor and your colour settings.




The Pain

  We love to travel, explore and stay close to the nature, but first of all we are the photographers. Many times we had to carry our cameras, backpacks and other heavy equipment throughout the day. 
  We believe that this sounds familiar to many of you.  You know the pain !
We have used and tested many different jackets and vests. Some of them were branded and expensive, others not but none of them ever fulfilled all our expectations and needs as the travellers, outdoorsmen and photographers. Why jackets and vests do not meet our requirements?
These are the most important reasons:


The vast majority of jackets can not be easily converted into a vest.


Most jackets don't protect at all our backs, necks and shoulders against harmful and painful pressure caused by the straps. Other jackets and vests don't provide sufficient protection.

The vast majority of jackets is not made from organic performance cotton. 


Some jackets are not weatherproof. And in turn, weatherproof jackets do not provide sufficient breathability.


Weatherproof jackets are often made of synthetic performance fabrics and contain various chemical agents (ie PFC) providing water repellency.In both cases they emit harmful chemical substances.
Most of the synthetic performance fabrics have limited durability and don't maintain its properties over the years.

Many jackets and vests do not have enough number of pockets, however, a few has too many. You don't need 42 pockets, do you ?


Most jackets have pockets which are not tailored to the needs of the traveler or photographer. In most cases hand-warming pockets do not really warm hands, cargo pockets are too small and pockets for glasses are annoying or do not exist. 


Most of the jackets don't have dedicated pockets for bottles. 

Many jackets are too long and thus unconvenient while sitting, crouching or driving, when the lower pockets are filled with stuff.





I can enumerate further and further. It is annoying and very, very frustrating.We have learned to live with. Unfortunately, often after years of this discomfort one has various health problems. For example with a back or a neck, and so forth.

The Remedy Out of this pain and frustration, Tomasz has dreamed of how to improve the design of jacket or vest to make it compatible with our and Yours requirements and free us from this frustration and pain. That’s how the UNCO was born.In recent months Tomasz rethought and verified his ideas. These ideas immediately appealed to me, our family, friends and colleagues, so we have invested a lot of effort and money in the design of the jacket as well as experimenting and testing different solutions and materials. The design philosophy was simple: UNCO CONCEPTS products are to be top performance - tough, functional, versatile and comfortable. The result is a unique jacket that is a combination of organic cotton fabric with highly effective padding inserts that protect the back, neck and shoulders and functionality tailored to the specific needs of outdoorsmen.In the recent months we have started collaborating with a professional company specializing in the apparel product development and pre-production of clothing.  This company works with large manufacturers and well-known designers of clothing. Subsequently, in close co-operation with this company, we have developed several early prototypes. Now we have in our hands three pre-production samples of UNCO Jacket and Vest and we are ready to deploy production.
However, we continue testing the jacket and work on further improvements. Currently planned changes include some improvements of pockets and flaps, as well as change of zippers and improvement of sleeve cuffs.We will also appreciate your suggestions on how to improve our jacket.Our final product will surely be even better. The UNCO Jacket and Vest
Why UNCO is compatible with our requirements?These are the most important reasons:
UNCO can be easily converted into a Vest, hence UNCO Jacket and Vest.

UNCO, thanks to a specially designed inserts made ​​of perforated Neoprene 8mm and 3mm  provides very effective protection of the back, neck and shoulders.


UNCO  is made of a premium EtaProof 100% organic cotton fabric.

UNCO  is naturally weatherproof - it withstands rainfall and keeps out all but very heavy and persistent rain, and creates an effective barrier guarding you from a wind chill.
UNCO   maintains extremely high breathability. A very high rate of transpiration of moisture guarantees the comfort with high physical activity. 
UNCO, made of pure organic cotton, does not use PFC or other harmful chemical agents to achieve water repellency hence, its Fluorcarbon free (RUC).
UNCO, made of EtaProof, is very durable and maintains its properties over the years. It develops a lovely distressed patina of age with use!
UNCO is sustainable - its made of renewable, organically produced cotton.
UNCO has 16 pockets of different sizes and tailored to the different needs and appropriately disposed.
UNCO   is also a bit shorter than most of the jackets to make it more convenient while sitting, crouching or driving.

 We are very proud of the product we have created !

 All the materials and accessories used are produced in Europe - in Switzerland, Germany, and UK. And the UNCO will be manufactured (sewn) in EU.  Our jacket - starting from its design, protective functions, comfortability, versatility and exclusive pure organic cotton fabric, through the best sliders, accessories and Neoprene inserts for superior performance - is a product of the highest quality. We believe that the quality and functional product will meet your interest !  This is why we came to the conclusion that it is worthwhile to start production of UNCO Jacket and Vest.

EtaProof Organic CottonEcology and Sustainability made in Switzerland

UNCO is made of the EtaProof Organic Cotton produced by Stotz & Co. AG in Switzerland. Organic cotton is grown from a non genetically modified plants without pesticides nor fertilizers. EtaProof Organic Cotton fabric is also PFC-free (Flourocarbon-free) and PFOA-free (Perfluorooctanoic acid - free) wchich are used in synthetic performance fabrics.EtaProof Organic Cotton  - the superb quality and very dense weave cloth - is carefully woven from extra long staple fibres - 3 times finer than a human hair - only found in certain rare species of cotton plant, and using 30% more yarn than conventional woven fabrics. The resulting textile is not coated or laminated. The combination of a dense weave and the swelling properties of the fibres providing excellent weatherproofing. This natural and organic textile offers a high level of comfort, look and feel, and is extremely breathable, waterproof, windproof, durable, as well as soft and quiet in use. It also has a strong resistance to tearing and burning. These properties are particularly appreciated by people who take a long-term exercise in difficult terrain.  The body and the hood  of the UNCO are made ​​of the double layer of 200g/m2  EtaProof Organic Cotton.The shell and lining are made of the same fabric. Sleeves of the UNCO Jacket are partialy made of double and partially of single EtaProof layer. 

The UNCO Jacket and Vest can be used in a wide range of climates and temperatures. EtaProof is similar to the English Ventile® fabric and has the same uses. It is used in outerwear performance garments and have military, medical and special workwear applications.
This kind of high performance cotton cloth, sometimes known as Oxford cotton or Egyptian cotton has been originally produced in England in the late 1930's. Nowadays, this remarkable cloth can be found under the brands Ventile® or EtaProof®, very similar cloth, but made in
Switzerland. History has it that during the World War II this cloth has been used by British RAF to manufacture fighter pilots' immersion suites. They proved to be very comfortable to wear in the cockpit under combat conditions and thanks to their high water tightness and thermal insulation properties saved lifes of many pilots keeping them warm and dry for long enough to enable them to be rescued.After the war these fabrics continued to be used for the air force, the navy and the special forces. Designs have changed over the years but you can still find suits made of this performance cotton in modern jets with the RAF and other NATO airforces.  Stotz & Co. AG, has been weaving such 
special dense cotton fabrics for the Mininstry of Defence (MoD) in Scandinavia and the USA since the 1960's, and since 1990' also for the British MoD. These fabrics were also used by many arctic and mountaineering expeditions, and earned a well-deserved reputation among fans of Bushcraft.Now, when we are a bit disappointed with the modern synthetic technical fabrics, these unique high performance cotton textile is seeing quite the renaissance and is increasingly being used by luxury and upmarket brands to produce exclusive lines of every day 
jackets and coats.  Read more about History of this unique cotton.

EtaProof Organic Cotton allows excellent ventilation and vapourisation - much better than synthetic performance fabrics.It is highly breathable - the most breathable weatherproof fabric available !  Suitable for Wide Range of ClimatesThe UNCO is also very nicely balanced - warm when it's cold and cool when it's hot.  It can be used in a wide range of climates and temperatures.
 With the use of an appropriate base-layer and mid-layer, the jacket is suitable for temperatures below 0 °C. However, after the conversion, the sleeveless Vest works very well in 
hot climates.
Comfortable and  Versatile
 The UNCO is a unisex product. Its sleeves can be zipped off and stashed in the back cargo pocket to convert the jacket into the UNCO Vest, The jacket also features a weatherproof hood, which can be zipped to the collar or stored in the back cargo pocket when it's not in use.  The UNCO is also a bit shorter than most of the jackets. This design makes it more  convenient while sitting, crouching or driving, when the lower pockets are filled with stuff.  The fit is a bit on a bulky side and highly adjustable, so it can be worn over a base-layer or mid-layer for comfortable load-carrying for all outdoor activities. To further increase comfort and mobility, the generous arm holes mean you won’t feel restricted even if you’re wearing several layers. The Jacket can be securely held open to maximise ventilation whilst preventing the sides from excessive movement in extreme circumstances.UNCO Jacket and Vest has 16 pockets of different sizes. The pockets are tailored to your various needs and appropriately disposed.12 outside pockets (4 zippered pockets and 6 flap pockets) including small neopren lined pockets for glasses, smartphone and accessories, hand-warming pockets that really warm hands, the large and very large cargo pockets as well as pockets designed to carry bottles or lenses. 4 inner zippered pockets, including 2 pockets, which are designed for documents or wallets and 2 pockets that can accommodate a full size tablet or a large map. 


The pocket designed to carry the bottles, the pocket for smartphone, and pocket for glasses. Durable and Tough, Quiet and Soft
    
 EtaProof Organic Cotton is very durable and tough - the fabric maintains its properties over the years, does not brittle like coated or laminated synthetic constructions.  Moreover, it has a strong resistance to tearing and burning.EtaProof Organic Cotton is very quiet. It generates no rustle or perturbing noise. Its ideal for camera work, hunting or bird watching where noise would be a problem. It is also soft, it wears like a cotton shirt, so it can be worn directly on the skin.  All these features make it  very comfortable. 
  Needless to say it is renewable.

Due to the complexity of the UNCO Jacket and Vest we have sourced 
for the best production facilities and finally choosen an excellent 
manufacturer with modern equipment, tools and vast experience. There are
 some manufacturers which accept low Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ), 
however our vendor will accept at least 100 pieces MOQ. Needless to say,
 also cost of materials and accessories increases for low MOQs.  
    We've built our early prototypes and pre-production samples and thoroughly tested different solutions, materials and functionality of the jacket. We’ve figured
 out our supply chain and production facility. Now we need 
your help to take the next step. We’re looking for funds to put the UNCO
 Jacket and Vest into production.

Here's why we need your help !

INITIAL GOAL : $45,000 = 100 UNCO Jackets-Vests
[in 4 colours (earth, camel, dark red, anthracite) and 3 sizes: M, L, XL]
  STRETCH GOAL #1 : $90,000 = 200 UNCO Jackets-Vests
[in 4 colours (earth, camel, dark red, anthracite) and 4 sizes: M, L, XL, XXL]
  STRETCH GOAL #2 : $175,000 = 400 UNCO Jackets-Vests
[in 5 colours (earth, camel, dark red, anthracite, olive) and 5 sizes: S, M, L, XL, XXL]

The Risks and Challenges
Designing and building new products always involves risk. As much as we design for high functionality, top quality and long term durability, design challenges are always present. Fortunately, we have spent the last 7 months working out the kinks. We are confident that we have worked through all major design challenges and we are ready to deploy the UNCO Jacket and Vest to the production.  We know what we’re doing.  We've built and tested our prototypes. We’ve figured out our supply chain and manufacturing facility. Based on the above and assuming the positive outcome of our campaign we do believe that we should be ready with the shipment of the jackets and vests in April 2015.We will regularly inform our Contributors and Supporters about the progress that we are making.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are almost ready to go. All the team members in Vorx are experienced with design, manufacturing and trading for international markets. We believe that all aspects of preparations are covered in this project, and that the risks are very minimal. However we are always prepared on the worst case scenario thus here're our list of concerns: <br/>Funding Target: <br/>We hope that we can meet with our funding goal but in case of unsuccessful situation then we will not be able to deliver this product. <br/>Quantity: <br/>We are prepared to fulfil larger than expected orders, however in case of order is much larger than expected, our promised delivery time will be extended. <br/>Shipping: <br/>Dealing with large numbers of individual shipments can be a painful task to our team. However we are in partnership with top tier fulfilment company, thus the logistic problem will be kept into minimal. <br/>Lost Packages: <br/>This could be an uncontrollable risk but we can assure you with our soonest follow ups should this be happening.</p>

Simply use the breathing light function as a soft mood light for sleeping or just to relax.
Rechargable Battery

The inbuilt 3600 mAh lithium battery is good enough to power maximum brightness for up to 4 hours on bright and 8 hours on normal.

We are almost ready to go. All the team members in Vorx are experienced with design, manufacturing and trading for international markets. We believe that all aspects of preparations are covered in this project, and that the risks are very minimal. However we are always prepared on the worst case scenario thus here're our list of concerns: Funding Target: We hope that we can meet with our funding goal but in case of unsuccessful situation then we will not be able to deliver this product. Quantity: We are prepared to fulfil larger than expected orders, however in case of order is much larger than expected, our promised delivery time will be extended. Shipping: Dealing with large numbers of individual shipments can be a painful task to our team. However we are in partnership with top tier fulfilment company, thus the logistic problem will be kept into minimal. Lost Packages: This could be an uncontrollable risk but we can assure you with our soonest follow ups should this be happening.

<p>An advertising car drives a year throughout Europe, toured countries and cities. It is fitted over and over with advertising messages and labels. You may think that advertising on a vehicle is old news? Not, however, when a brightly colored, eye-catching advertising car travels through a great part of the world. There is a lot of creative energy in each individual logo and all these creativity together result in the art work ""onemillioncar"". Once the car is completely emerged in advertisement, ""onemillioncar"" sets off on the long trek through Europe.</p>
<p>onemillioncar therefor, because the value of all advertising space adds up to 1 million euros.</p>
<p>But the car can do much, much more than just being a show in itself - it also offers free carpool opportunities. Have you ever sat inside an advertising column and waved to passersby? You can do so - no problem. The rolling art and advertising object is game for anything. For example scavenger hunts would be a great thing: who finds the colorful car first? Furthermore, those who have the same route as this ambassador on wheels, could use it for a joint venture. How amazing is <strong style=""color: #ff6600;"">free rent</strong> on a car used for taking holidays?</p>
<p>And the main thing for passersby is that they should have fun,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to be photographed with the car</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make a video in front of the car where they dance or even sing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maybe to send a message to your love</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or whatever they want ...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And the best entries received will get a prize for their creativity and effort.<br/><br/>Of course, everyone should know where his advertising message currently is ... therefore, there is a GPS as well as a map on the Internet. <br/>A touch of adventure is always good because life is serious enough. The colorful car also experiences <strong style=""color: #ff6600;"">many adventures</strong> along the way.

By focussing on these ""simple"" things, we want you to defray your focus from your daily stressed life.The last awareness we want to create is our ecological footprint. We use 80% less water than normal residential dwellings. This is through eco-friendly techniques but mainly by simply using less water. Instead of waisting 90 liters of clean water through showers and toilets we provide hot showers that require the minimum time to wash yourself as well as composting toilets that are inspired by sailing boats.Our 3 types:The Glass CubeSuspended at more than 5 metres above the ground, this bright glass cabin provides singles or couples with an unforgettable experience of being 360° surrounded by nature. The only way up is via a ladder. And once you’re in, there’s a good chance you might not want to leave anymore. The 28m² Glass Cube cabin has a mezzanine that sleeps 2 people and comes with an off-grid kitchen, bathroom and composting toilet.To allow you to fully see, experience and even smell nature the Glass Cube also has a 15m² rooftop terrace between the treetops with unique views on your surroundings.  The Flying FermettePerhaps you long to get out in nature, but you also appreciate the cosy, private feeling of more secluded shelter at night. Then our Flying Fermette will make you right feel at home whilst constantly reminding you that you are on an unforgettable adventure between the treetops. At 4 metres above the ground, the 31m² cabin has 2 large glass fronts on both ends of the cabin that provide splendid views on the surrounding forest. The 5m² covered terrace allows you to get just that little bit closer to nature, even when it rains.The walls and roof, made from recycled barn wood, give this retreat an unexpected familiar feel in an uncommon setting as it is inspired by the traditional Belgian farmhouse. The Flying Fermette cabin has an off-grid kitchen, bathroom with composting toilet, living room and a dining room followed with the covered patio attached to it. The mezzanine accommodates 2 people and a sofa with mattress can sleep 2 more guests.The cathedralOur impressive 8-metre tall Cathedral offers the best of both worlds for you and your family. It’s a safe haven close to the earth. At 1 metre above the ground, it’s easily – and safely – accessible for all ages. This 30m² sturdy retreat is all about real and authentic connection as its design encourages you to spend uninterrupted time together. At the same time, you’ll never lose touch with nature through carefully framed views on each side of the cabin. Create an intimate atmosphere by making a warm, cosy fire together in the stove.And what better way to finish a magical day than by stargazing from the 8-metre high rooftop terrace between the highest treetops? The Cathedral provides shelter to a maximum of 5 people. The 2 mezzanines each have room for 2 people to sleep and a sofa bed can sleep a 5th person. The cabin has an off grid kitchen, living room, dining room and a bathroom with a toilet and shower.TimingWe are in the last stage of the construction phase which are the interior works.What will the money be used for?The entire project was financed through a mix of our own equity and traditional bankloans. The money we raise is a way to create working capital in advance so we can acquire supplies for the hotel exploitation.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

  Born On KickstarterThis is not our first rodeo. Last year, we successfully launched an everyday bag called the 7ven Messenger right here on Kickstarter. We received amazing feedback from our backers and have improved every segment of the business to keep bringing you awesome, high-quality gear.   COLOUR CHOICES  DJI Drone StorageThe padded bottom compartment was specifically made to hold the DJI Mavic Pro and Spark drone. Now you can take them anywhere you go.   More Camera Storage OptionsIf you are a casual photographer, the drone compartment is big enough for a full-size camera body and one camera lens. If you need to carry more camera gear upgrade to the full photography experience using our removable CAMERA KIT SYSTEM (available for order after the campaign).The Camera Kit System holds up to two full-size camera bodies and 4 camera lenses.   Tripod MountThe Shift Pack was designed to provide versatility to the photographer. It features a removable magnetic tripod strap system for securing your tripod (available for order after the campaign).  Equipment ProtectionThe multi-purpose drone/camera compartment is FULLY PADDED for protection against accidental drops and bumps. Not a Regular Camera BagWhen you are traveling with your expensive camera gear you want to be discrete about it. This is why Shift Pack wasn't designed to look like a regular camera bag.  The Shift Pack comes with features designed to make your travel effortless and fun.    Adaptable Storage SpaceThe Shift Pack uses a unique transformable storage space that can divide the backpack's main compartment into two sections when needed. Now you can store your clean clothes and dirty laundry separately. Expandable Storage SpaceGo from 20 L to 35 L in a matter of seconds.

My name is Michelle Papale. At age 15 I started to have a desire to help and take the time to know the overlooked and poor people of the earth. I didn't know how, where, or when I would do this, but as I was sure that God had planted the desire in me, I kept my heart and mind open to anything He brought my way.  <br/><p>This past year (August 2011- Present) I have been working non stop and saving EVERY PENNY so that when God opened a door, I would have the finances to be able to walk through it. Finally in February, God gave me the opportunity to go to India for a 1 week missions trip. It was amazing! All of the money I had worked so hard to obtain went towards the trip but it was COMPLETELY worth it. But now I find myself with another opportunity to go to India! This time it is for two months, and I will be involved with MUCH more than on my first trip:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teaching English and Hygene in a slum's school</li>
<li>Visiting people in a leper colony</li>
<li>Assisting caretakers at 2 children's homes and</li>
<li>Helping with the expansion into India of a teen to teen outreach program called BreakDown International</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I need to raise $2,000 dollars by May 11.</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,200 for my plane ticket</li>
<li>$300 to buy clothes and shoes to bring for children in need</li>
<li>$200 as a donation to the people giving me free room and board and</li>
<li>$300 for transportation and food</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this money will go towards spending money for any shopping or tourism I will do. I will pay for that myself. ANY and ALL extra money will be used to purchase clothing, shoes, or food for people in need.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
I will not be able to pay for this trip without your help! Please consider making a donation to my cause no matter how small it  is!</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If you aren't able to financially support me, or would like to help me in another way, please advertise my cause on Facebook, Twitter, or anywhere else you can think of. THANKS!!!</div></div>","Short Summary

<p><strong>                  Cloned Dinosaurs Have Been Created!</strong></p>
<p>Greetings to dinosaur enthusiasts, theme park addicts and internet denizens. Robert Vowles here, pondering the element of coincidence in everyday life. I'm working on a revolutionary dinosaur theme park project and this crazy Irish guy with an eye patch comes to my office bloviating about cloned dinosaurs. Hey, a dinosaur theme park with real dinosaurs, that would be revolutionary. </p>

<h3>The Expeditions</h3>
<p>The expeditions involve small groups of participants entering a dangerous dinosaur wilderness. Each group will be led by a <strong>Team Leader</strong> who is trained in wilderness survival and first aid. Each expedition team has an assignment involving dinosaur research. These assignments involve everything from photography and egg harvesting to the tranquilizing of dangerous predators for the acquisition of blood samples. At any time these plans are subject to immediate suspension should one of the other expedition teams have an emergency or some other disaster occurs. At this point your expedition immediately becomes a rescue team or a mobile forensic unit.</p>
<p><strong>To get an idea of what the expedition would be like read the Dienonychous Adventure on the link below ""The Theme Park Revolution Article.""</strong></p>
<p><strong>REMEMBER ALL THE ACTION WILL BE LIVE STREAMED TO THE INTERNET!</strong></p>
<p>For those seeking adventure with a smaller component of fear, expeditions will be arranged that only venture into areas inhabited by herbivores. You still need to be tough, but the possible horror element will be eliminated.</p>
<p>The dinosaur expeditions last approximately 12 hours. At the end of the 12 hours a dinosaur feast will be held at which time the bravery and resourcefulness of our intrepid explorers will be celebrated. Expedition members and staff will share stories, review video and discuss how the experience can be improved. At the close of festivities you are invited to camp in our safe area if you wish. You have until twelve noon the next day to  <em>check out. </em>Any visitors found on the property after this time will be taken to the Deinonychous area to participate in feeding time.</p>
<p>   Expedition participants are responsible for their own travel expenses unless otherwise arranged. If someone merits inclusion we will provide extra help if we have the resources. Those going on 12 hour expeditions are responsible for their own camping equipment, keep it light and lean.  We provide the food, you are responsible  for making us aware of any allergies. We will make every reasonable effort to modify expeditions to accommodate our supporters, but at the end of the day I have to say the 12 hour expeditions are rough.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can't run up two flights of stairs without panting.</li>
<li>If you have a history of heart disease or any other ailment that makes extreme physical exertion or intense psychological stress likely to result in life threatening symptoms.</li>
<li>If you close your eyes at the scary parts in horror movies.</li>
<li>If exposure to dirt gives you an overwhelming desire to shower and change your clothes.</li>
<li>If a mosquito bite sees you running for the first aid kit.</li>
<li>If your favourite possession is your mattress.</li>
<li>If you feel like the conveniences and creature comforts of the modern world are a natural part of your life support system.</li>
</ul><p><strong>If any of the above are true of you (especially the first 2), then our dinosaur expeditions are to be avoided! If you're just a little out of shape and you still want to go, then use that desire as motivation to diet and exercise. Reach for your potential and you could find yourself on a 12 hour dinosaur expedition; probably a good idea to try camping, if you've never set foot outside a city. As Andy likes to say, ""You've got to be tough!"" How will you know if you're tough if you've never been tested?</strong></p>
<p><strong>All perks related to expedition participation are subject to the success or failure of our fund raising campaign. If we don't come close to our funding targets we will be forced to modify the quality and quantity of expeditions. Whatever happens our philosophy is to be creative in adversity and so we will make the best of whatever situation we find ourselves in. Expeditions are slated to occur in the summer of 2014.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If we get support far above the requested amount we will consider organizing elite expeditions utilizing experienced participants who we know can handle the profound physical and mental challenges. These expeditions would last at least 24 hours.  </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you do not like the requirements and demands of the Dinosaur Expedition option you can chose the Dinosaur Adventure, just ""Vote for the Therizinosaurus"".  With this perk you and five other people are entitled to a two hour adventure, summer 2014 and one Dinosaur Expedition Field Bag. You will be contacted to arrange a time and date for your adventure. <strong>Remember</strong> if we don't come close to our fund raising goal the duration and quality  of the adventure component of your perk will be adversely affected. You don't want to go on a dinosaur expedition and not see any dinosaurs!</p>
<p><strong>TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW ABOUT THE DINOSAUR EXPEDITION. THE MORE FUNDING WE GET, THE BETTER THE EXPERIENCE!</strong></p>
<p>All those supporters selected to go on an Expedition can opt for the two hour adventure. Please give us atleast 48 hours notice of any changes. </p>

<h3> <span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Who is Robert Vowles?</span>
</h3>
<p>I have a curriculum vitae the Coen brothers could turn into a screen play. I've done every kind of theater from<em> Murder Mysteries and</em> <em>Improv</em> to absurdist <em>Ionesco</em>.  As a special effects model maker I've worked on everything from TV shows to ad campaigns. I've earned a contractors top rate and as a blue collar labourer I've made minimum wage. You could say I have a well rounded perspective on the working world.</p>
<p>In the early nineties I got heavily involved in theme park design and promotion. This culminated in my leading a team of twenty-eight top creative and professional people as project manager for the Labyrinth project. This concept called for the creation of a vast complex of historical venues featuring interactive live theater seamlessly integrated with completely themed simulator rides. No theater seating! The action would have propelled people on to all manner of conveyances from horse drawn wagons and old sailing vessels  to space ships. In fact the experience would have been so realisitc that people would not have realized they were on simulator rides. The 250 million dollar Labyrinth was never built, but I learned many valuable lessons and I have applied them in developing my latest project.</p>

<h3>                         THE BIG VISION.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>The purpose of this Indiegogo Campaign is to introduce a revolutionary, twenty-first century theme park project. It is revolutionary because it is everything that twentieth century theme parks are not.    </p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>It can be built for less than ten percent the cost of a traditional park, it is environmentally sensitive, there are no lineups, no price gouging and it recognizes that people are not the same as they were in 1955; nor is the social fabric or the technological infrastructure. The rigid architecture and operating structures of the traditional theme park mitigate against a full realization of the potential of the internet. Look at a contemporary theme park and it's like the internet was never even invented. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>In our proposed park the visitor's experience will be so personalized and so compelling that their adventure acquires significant entertainment value and can be live streamed to the internet on a pay for view basis. But people half way around the world won't just be watching, they'll be participating. Welcome to the world's first wired theme park. Share with your friends, family and the whole world.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Honestly who would pay to see someone on a roller coaster or dark ride? But they would pay to see a real time adventure as exciting as any movie. <strong>Welcome to the age of live movies.</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to break the monopoly the big entertainment companies hold over the multi-billion dollar theme park industry by building an attraction for less than fifty million dollars. Our philosophy is to stress programming and special effects and minimize the amount spent on costly infrastructure so damaging to the environment and investor's nerves. This project marks the evolution of the theme park from an obsession with physical architecture to a story architecture bolstered by an evocative wilderness and astounding special effects.</p>

<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> Business Revolution</span>
</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Since the early days of the theme park industry it has been a cardinal rule that attractions should be built to accomodate peak day attendance. With their fantastic architecture and sophisticated ride infrastructure this is a costly precept. But it has generated enormous profits for large entertainment companies and made theme parks an enduring part of modern culture.</p>
<p>In the last twenty years increasing costs and economic instability have thrown the viability of theme parks into question. Disney's California Adventure, Bonfante Gardens and the ill fated Hard Rock Park are glaring examples of the perils of contemporary theme park development. Only companies like Disney have the resources to spend a billion dollars in one year on damage control.   </p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Rather than build an attraction where the visitor experience is oriented around costly architecture and ride technology; capital assets that must be built to accommodate massive numbers that are only present 20 to 30 percent of the time. We propose a park where the experience is oriented around out door adventure. This requires a minimum of expense. In fact we propose to create both the biggest theme park in the world and the least expensive. We can absorb huge numbers, but when our park is only a quarter full we are not bleeding money because a billion dollars in capital assets is under utilized.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>In our park there are no fairy tale castles or towers of terror. There is only powerful immersive experience and the truly unexpected. Venture back into time 65 million years when predators had 8 inch fangs and browsing herbivores weighed as much as a herd of elephants. Excitement comes from interacting in a myriad of ways with these strange denizens of the park; dinosaurs. Weird, wonderful, dangerous and always on the move! </p>

<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Theme Park Revolution</span>
</h3>
<p>While balancing the heavy demands of personal and professional responsibilities I have devoted a tremendous amount of time over the last twenty years to developing a new kind of theme park. I reject the traditional  theme park model with its cacophony of themes and frenzied, effects driven rides. In contrast I propose an attraction with one comprehensive theme. Visitors are invited to immerse themselves in this alternate reality for extended periods of time. They not only participate, they help shape the course of events. In this attraction special effects are in the service of story elements, not the other way around.</p>
<p>The Labyrinth was one incarnation of this new kind of theme park on the road I took to the Dinosaur Park concept; an attraction that saves money and drastically decreases damage to the natural environment by having a minimal infrastructure. Traditional theme parks literally gut the natural world as they create hugely expensive artificial paradises. The possibility of building a theme park is no longer the monopoly of an exclusive club when hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure are no longer required.</p>
<p>An ecologically friendly business model that can be adapted to the unique requirements of developing countries could open the door to large scale ecotourism. By increasing the perceived value of disappearing natural systems we recalibrate the calculations of cash strapped local governments in favour of ecologically sustainable development strategies. Such approaches could also help lift underemployed populations out of recurring cycles of poverty and overpopulation.</p>

<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>The elements of sharing, proactive behaviour and empowerment are part of people's everyday lives as they play their computer games, share music with friends and decide moment to moment what they will watch, listen to and participate in. I propose to weave these elements into the dinosaur theme park. What better way to begin than with a series of expeditions into a wilderness inhabited by these most fascinating and dangerous of creatures.  The plans for the eventual park are on the drawing board, thousands of hours have yet to be committed and yet people will be experiencing the sharp edge of what the park will someday offer. This is product development with the customer at the heart of the creative process. With live streaming to thousands of potential customers watching and sharing their brutally honest evaluations, we truly open up the creative process. With engagement on many levels we achieve a quality of participation that excites public interest and informs our creative process.</p>
<p>In many ways this project is inspired by the empowerment brought about by the internet age. It is also inspired by a less positive manifestation of the new web world. A significant number of people have become so consumed with their electronic gadgets they are increasingly alienated from their own physicality and their place in the natural world. We hope that our project can play a small part in helping to reverse this trend.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why Dinosaurs?</h3>
<p>I am a science fiction enthusiast, I don't know how many times I've watched the Alien movies. You could call me a history buff. I read every book in Colleen McCullough's <em>Masters of Rome</em> series and hungered for more. Why develop another dinosaur attraction when this theme has been done to death? As well there are  many exciting themes that have not been exploited, why not do one of these? </p>
<p>First of all, other themes I'd like to explore require too much infrastructure. The cost is prohibitive. The dinosaur theme requires minimal infrastructure and results in less environmental impact. The second reason I chose the dinosaur theme arises from the glaring fact that no dinosaur attraction, no dinosaur event, no dinosaur movie correctly portrays the scientifically established behaviours and capabilities of the<em> clade dinosauria</em>. Certainly it is true that my attraction can't possibly recreate their lost world even if I have <em>live dinosaurs</em>. Be that as it may, the attraction I propose by having dinosaurs outside in a wilderness location, moving rapidly and behaving naturally, will come closer to capturing the essence of dinosaurs than any previous portrayal.</p>
<p>You can have the most sophisticated animatronic T Rex in the world, but if it's shuffling about letting 10 year olds stroke it's snout, then it is really nothing more than a scary looking puppet. In our attraction no one will be allowed anywhere near the T Rex. In our attraction if you find yourself in the presence of the T Rex you will understand primal fear.</p>
<p>                           <img alt=""Inaccurate T Rex illustration"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSYlwn5Hlh3saF_zEd8h_7MwnhITKQj-PM0RyGYPEiPw-0DbXoT"" src="""" style="""" title=""Outdated Rex""/></p>
<h3>                      Outdated T Rex Illustration</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The T Rex (Regina) and the Expedition for Knowledge.</h3>
<p>(By all estimates the female T Rex was larger than the male, hence Tyrannosaurus Regina).</p>
<p>We hope to have many different types of dinosaurs for expedition participants to study and observe. In fact by your level of support you will help to determine what kind of dinosaurs will inhabit the dinosaur wilderness.  It is my advice to anyone hoping to join an expedition that they avoid providing any support for a T Rex cloning program. An examination of the historic T Rex will validate my advice and also underline my declaration concerning the inaccuracies of past T Rex portrayals and by extension the numerous flawed depictions of dinosaurs prevalent in popular culture.</p>
<p>Through fossil forensics we have discovered healed wounds on large herbivores that could only have come from a T Rex. In this case tooth size and shape are the smoking gun. This evidence would seem to close the debate over whether the Rex was a carnivore or merely an opportunistic scavenger. All physiological evidence seems to point to an extremely active and hungry carnivore. This behaviour in a creature weighing upwards of 8 tons would definitely pose a danger to humans. How much danger?</p>
<p>To appreciate the horrible death potential posed by a full grown  or even a half grown Tyrannosaur we need to examine its capabilities. For our purposes it is instructive to contrast the scientifically established capability with a portrayal in popular culture. I'm sure everyone remembers the scene in the first<em> Jurassic Park</em> movie when Dr. Grant was standing beside the overturned jeep with Hammond's granddaughter. There in front of them stands a hungry T Rex. Apparently the lawyer was merely an appetizer.</p>
<p>The good doctor advises the girl that the Tyrannosaurus can't see them if they don't move. Of course he means voluntary movements, but of course there are many involuntary movements and I'm afraid the T Rex was equipped to see all of them. This terrifying animal had depth perception superior  to other carnivorous dinosaurs. With its perfect binocular vision it had a canny ability to judge distances, a useful capability for an apex hunter. The eyes themselves were incomparable. Imagine a hawk with binoculars and you get some appreciation for  the Rex's visual acuity. So I'm afraid Dr. Grant the Tyrannosaur can see your chest move as you breath, every twitch of your face, every micro movement of your eyes. He sees about as well as it is possible to see.</p>
<p>The olfactory capability was every bit as formidable. Imagine an 8 ton blood hound, but keep in mind the nostril separation in this hound from hell allowed for 3D olfactory perception. He could smell a triceratops fart from a mile away and move towards its author with the accuracy of a guided missile. This sensory arsenal was completed by a sense of hearing of incomparable acuity. In a scientifically accurate Jurassic Park the T Rex could hear the breathing, the heart beat and the gas bubbles percolating in the churning guts of the three terrified humans by the overturned jeep. So if we neutralize for a moment Spielberg's genius for drama and rely on cold hard science there is no dramatic moment by the jeep. Nature's ultimate predator eats the goat, the lawyer, Doc Grant and the two kids in seconds. But is he fast enough to catch the jeep? The latest research seems to indicate that we have underestimated the tail muscle mass the T Rex used to maximize speed by as much as 45%. So before the jeep even gets up to speed its 3 occupants are already dead.</p>
<p>If<em> Dinosaur Expedition</em> supporters indeed successfully vote for a T Rex a series of protocols will be established invoking distance requirements, the  use of visual, auditory and olfactory decoys and the utilization of a number of repellent technologies. If the Rex demonstrates predatory behaviours towards expedition participants we will get to the nearest ATV trail and rendezvous with our ATV mobile security detail for extraction. Under no circumstances will firearms be utilized. The potential for making a tragic situation catastrophic is too great. Andy's AK47 is permanently retired.</p>
<p>Thinking a dinosaur's appearance tells the whole story makes about as much sense as saying a man's shadow explains his essence. For too long the entertainment business has been satisfied with shallow depictions and the complex reality of these creatures has been ignored. They knew the T Rex was a monster, but even the paleontologists weren't sure how dangerous was the beast. With the latest research it's hard to imagine it could be any more lethal. The more we find out about both carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs the more we develop respect for these awesome creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Instructed by the facts and emboldened by the capabilities science gives us, we will attempt to do justice to the T Rex and creatures like it. The educational possibilities are electrifying! </strong></p>

<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>Your support will give us the financial muscle we need to make the expeditions and adventures possible. But your personal commitment to the project is what brings it to life. It is through the Indiegogo perks that together we mediate how you as a supporter will engage with the project. If you desperately want to go on an expedition your chances improve as your level of support increases. If you just can't afford to give much support, but still want to improve your chances you can seek an endorsement from a higher level supporter. If this higher level supporter is selected for an expedition their endorsement can greatly improve your chances. (Higher level supporters are allowed to give one endorsement).</p>
<p> If you wish to support the project with a generous contribution, but have no desire to wade through mosquito infested swamps looking for predators the size of school buses, then we'll reward your generosity with a fine prehistoric themed gift. If you're too old or out of shape to go on expeditions yet long for adventure, we will provide a modified experience of shorter duration.</p>
<p>The Indiegogo perks empower our supporters in other ways. Each level of support is a vote for a particular type of dinosaur. The greater the support at a particular level, the better the chance the dinosaur associated with that level will be <em>cloned, (</em>if second generation<em> hatched </em>or if already in existence, <em>selected</em> for survival in our park). The votes of higher levels are worth more than lower level votes. Higher levels of support are also associated with all types of significant participation in the project, not necessarily involving exposure to the dinosaur wilderness. This could involve designing a shirt for our online store. If the shirt design is selected it will be featured, we will provide links to your online <strong>dinosaur themed</strong> store and other exciting perks. Another perk offers the supporter the opportunity to create video content for our online channel. Selection criteria would include things like the educational content, entertainment value and quality.</p>
<p>At the higher levels, expedition participation is guaranteed and the potential for significant involvement with the dinosaur theme park is offered. In all cases more support means better perks, but merit is also an important factor. Chose a perk that allows you to highlight your best qualities and you may find yourself an important part of the project. Don't delude yourself. Do not involve yourself at a level of support involving participation and assume you will be successful if you have no experience in the skill associated with that type of participation.</p>

<h3>The Project Team </h3>
<p>Certain key members of the project team are in place, but the funding we receive will determine the ultimate size and character of the group. The skills involved in designing and implementing important parts of the project are highly specialized and require appropriate remuneration.</p>
<p>We are very lucky indeed to have<strong> Walter Klassen</strong> join the team as technical advisor. He is a legend in the movie business and his encyclopedic technical knowledge will bolster the entire dinosaur expedition project.<em> (To see a recent newspaper article on Walter hit the link on my 21st. June, 2013 favourite tweet). <a href=""https://twitter.com/RobertVowles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://twitter.com/RobertVowles</a></em></p>
<p>This project is temporarily dominated by old guys and<strong> Juliana Vowles</strong> provides the priceless perspective of a young professional. She has work experience in the public and private sector and her perceptive mind and limitless creativity is an invaluable asset.</p>
<p>A number one priority for the project team is to make the expeditions as safe as possible. <strong>Alex Smith</strong> in his role as Program Coordinator for Recreation and Leisure at Fleming College in Peterborough, Ontario is in an ideal position to provide us with qualified expedition team leaders.</p>
<p>It is my intention to employ a substantial number of students in parts of the project where I believe their contribution will be invaluable.. I have been in touch with the wireless technology department at Fleming and they are interested in making involvement with the project both a school assignment and a source of summer employment for students. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As project manager it is my job to mediate between three fundamental objectives.</p>
<p>            1. The creation of mind blowing experiences.</p>
<p>            2. The maximization of supporter participation.</p>
<p>            3. The ultimate goal of creating the worlds first, truly 21st century</p>
<p>                 theme park.</p>
<p>It is essential that I put together a team that can help me reach all these goals. It is my belief that this project will generate opportunities that will make project goals not only achievable and mutually supportive, but also a means to undreamed of potential.  </p>

<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Expedition Rules</span>
</h3>
<p><strong>There are rules that must be followed, failure to follow rules may result in the immediate termination of the expedition.</strong> Here's a<strong> sample</strong> of some of our rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>You must be 18 years or older at the time your expedition is to occur.          </li>
<li>No firearms or weapons of any kind on the expeditions, you do not want your adventure to end in a long stay in a Canadian penal institution.</li>
<li>No alcohol or illicit drugs are permitted.</li>
<li>No racist, sexist, inflammatory comments or abusive behaviour is allowed.</li>
<li>No reckless behaviour likely to result in injury to yourself or others.</li>
<li>No smoking; the threat of forest fire and the health concerns of others make this rule non-negotiable. </li>
<li>No persons with a history of serious mental instability or violent criminal behavior.</li>
<li>No pregnant women.</li>
<li><strong>It is imperative that you obey the orders of your Team Leader at all times. </strong></li>
</ul><p><strong>If you don't like rules and resent being told what to do that's fine, stay home we don't want you on the expeditions! DO NOT misrepresent your physical or mental condition when being interviewed. All those selected for expeditions will undergo VIGOROUS TESTS prior to transportation to the Dinosaur Wilderness. You will only be inconveniencing other people and jeopardizing your own participation at a level that is safe for you by being loose with the truth.</strong></p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Comprehensive Liability Waver</span></h3>
<p>All businesses especially themed attractions go to great pains to insure their facilities are safe. Artificial worlds are constructed specifically for we fragile humans and still accidents happen. It seems everyone has a  lawyer ready to seek their version of justice. If you wish to go on our expeditions have no illusions, there is danger and you will be signing away your legal redress; wild animals are dangerous, insects and snakes are poisonous, water can drown you and tree roots can trip you. In addition I brew my coffee boiling hot, if you spill it on yourself don't call your lawyer.</p>
<p>Our eventual attraction will have adventures for visitors with safety concerns. But at this stage we can only offer expedition participants blood, toil, tears and sweat with the chance of incredible thrills. If you have concerns you should seriously consider staying home. <strong>All expedition participants will be required to sign our comprehensive liability waver without exception.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Dinosaur Expedition Budget</h3>
<p>I have endeavoured to create a flexible cost structure that allows me to adapt to the input that I get from my supporters and satisfy my own requirements. My primary goal and the goal that sustains all others is the goal of demonstrating that dynamic immersive entertainment of extended duration has huge potential. This goal is balanced by the need to move as many supporters as possible safely through the expedition process. With so many unknowable elements it will be fascinating to see how the project eventually manifests itself.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dinosaur Creation and Care Costs</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the choices of our supporters the</p>
<p>dinosaur population will incline towards many smaller       <strong>              </strong></p>
<p>dinosaurs on the one hand or a few large dinosaurs<strong>                      $205,000</strong></p>
<p>at the other extreme. The more meat eaters selected</p>
<p>the more dangerous the expeditions. Remember if no</p>
<p>herbivores are selected the only readily available  food</p>
<p>source will be you. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Labour Costs </strong></p>
<p>For the kind of quality experience we are proposing you</p>
<p>need trained, high quality staff. One of our goals is to</p>
<p>provide people with decent well paying jobs. The fact this               <strong>$86,400</strong>                            </p>
<p>goal rebounds to the benefit of our supporters is a double</p>
<p>good.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Vehicles, Maintenance and Fuel  Costs</strong></p>
<p>A full range of vehicles from trucks to ATVs will be required</p>
<p>for the movement of staff, equipment, expedition participants       <strong>  $45,000</strong></p>
<p>and security personnel. We will economize by the utilization of</p>
<p>used, rental and leased vehicles.</p>

<h3>Problems With This Project</h3>
<p>When presenting a business plan to investors it is customary for entrepreneurs to detail the weaknesses in their plans. I believe this courtesy is also appropriate when seeking funds from the Indiegogo community. You value your money and you deserve the straight goods.</p>
<p>The idea of giving the public immersive, participatory adventures of extended duration has great appeal. If it wasn't so fraught with difficulties the theme park industry would have done it long ago. Our intention of live streaming the action adds an additional element of peril to the endeavour.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is the case that some people when given the opportunity to participate  see this as a license to behave in a boorish and infantile manner, amusing themselves at the expense of everyone else. On a number of visits to theme parks I observed such behaviour on rides where limited participation was offered in the pre-shows. In my time as a carnival showman I experimented with crowd participation and developed a number of effective tactics for insuring the entertainment went in a positive direction. Of course I didn't have to deal with live dinosaurs.</p>
<p>In the context of the overall project there is a vast, untested strategic vision that must be implemented. Challenges involving staffing, equipment selection and expedition management are all very daunting. Situating the project in a wilderness location poses risks to supporters and staff. Although every reasonable precaution will be taken, anything can happen. The logistics of getting injured or ill participants to a hospital are complex. In regards to wild non-dinosaur animals I have been venturing into wilderness areas all my life in groups and also alone.  I find even the larger animals want nothing more than to avoid humans at all costs. If you extend them the same courtesy there shouldn't be a problem.  </p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest failing of this project is the potentially large number of small supporters who want to go on expeditions and aren't selected because of inadequate capacity. There is a simple mathematical reality at work here. The cost for one person to go on an expedition is well over a thousand dollars if we take into account total project cost. My good intentions can't change this fact. It takes a large number of small supporters to pay for one expedition participant. It is my hope that premium perks attract enough big supporters to underwrite the involvement of lesser supporters.<strong> If you're a small supporter you can have a huge impact on the project if you tell the right person that the DINOSAURS ARE BACK  and there's an <em> EXPEDITION !</em>  </strong></p>
<p>If we reach our funding goal and our fixed capital costs have been met a higher a percentage of any additional funds can go towards operating costs. That means more financial resources can be directed towards insuring a higher percentage of lower level supporters can go on additional expeditions. Unfortunately management and safety issues preclude us stuffing existing expeditions with more people.</p>

                               The Dinosaur Expedition.

 
                  A first step in reaching our dream of building
         the world's first, genuine, Jurassic style adventure park! 
If you're interested in revolutionizing the theme park industry, creating cutting edge twenty-first century entertainment, providing meaningful, well paying employment for hundreds of people, educating young people in a physically challenging environment, enlightening the old and along the way helping to promote sustainable business practices, then read on!  If you want to actively participate in promoting all these things then lace up your hiking boots, you might just be going on a dinosaur expedition.  ALL THE ACTION WILL BE LIVE STREAMED TO THE INTERNET MAKING THIS THE WORLD'S FIRST LIVE INTERNET MOVIE! This project is one giant perk for as many supporters as we can accommodate. If you can't participate financially, but still want to help the project, use the Indiegogo share tools. Tell your friends, tell family, tell strangers its been 65 million years and the dinosaurs are back! 
 
                  Cloned Dinosaurs Have Been Created!
Greetings to dinosaur enthusiasts, theme park addicts and internet denizens. Robert Vowles here, pondering the element of coincidence in everyday life. I'm working on a revolutionary dinosaur theme park project and this crazy Irish guy with an eye patch comes to my office bloviating about cloned dinosaurs. Hey, a dinosaur theme park with real dinosaurs, that would be revolutionary. 
  CAMPAIGN VIDEO: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjiRjZFACDE&feature=c4-overview&list=UUxgstw4cpMQcpCu75mnK3lw

The Expeditions
The expeditions involve small groups of participants entering a dangerous dinosaur wilderness. Each group will be led by a Team Leader who is trained in wilderness survival and first aid. Each expedition team has an assignment involving dinosaur research. These assignments involve everything from photography and egg harvesting to the tranquilizing of dangerous predators for the acquisition of blood samples. At any time these plans are subject to immediate suspension should one of the other expedition teams have an emergency or some other disaster occurs. At this point your expedition immediately becomes a rescue team or a mobile forensic unit.
To get an idea of what the expedition would be like read the Dienonychous Adventure on the link below ""The Theme Park Revolution Article.""
REMEMBER ALL THE ACTION WILL BE LIVE STREAMED TO THE INTERNET!
For those seeking adventure with a smaller component of fear, expeditions will be arranged that only venture into areas inhabited by herbivores. You still need to be tough, but the possible horror element will be eliminated.
The dinosaur expeditions last approximately 12 hours. At the end of the 12 hours a dinosaur feast will be held at which time the bravery and resourcefulness of our intrepid explorers will be celebrated. Expedition members and staff will share stories, review video and discuss how the experience can be improved. At the close of festivities you are invited to camp in our safe area if you wish. You have until twelve noon the next day to  check out. Any visitors found on the property after this time will be taken to the Deinonychous area to participate in feeding time.
   Expedition participants are responsible for their own travel expenses unless otherwise arranged. If someone merits inclusion we will provide extra help if we have the resources. Those going on 12 hour expeditions are responsible for their own camping equipment, keep it light and lean.  We provide the food, you are responsible  for making us aware of any allergies. We will make every reasonable effort to modify expeditions to accommodate our supporters, but at the end of the day I have to say the 12 hour expeditions are rough.

If you can't run up two flights of stairs without panting.
If you have a history of heart disease or any other ailment that makes extreme physical exertion or intense psychological stress likely to result in life threatening symptoms.
If you close your eyes at the scary parts in horror movies.
If exposure to dirt gives you an overwhelming desire to shower and change your clothes.
If a mosquito bite sees you running for the first aid kit.
If your favourite possession is your mattress.
If you feel like the conveniences and creature comforts of the modern world are a natural part of your life support system.
If any of the above are true of you (especially the first 2), then our dinosaur expeditions are to be avoided! If you're just a little out of shape and you still want to go, then use that desire as motivation to diet and exercise. Reach for your potential and you could find yourself on a 12 hour dinosaur expedition; probably a good idea to try camping, if you've never set foot outside a city. As Andy likes to say, ""You've got to be tough!"" How will you know if you're tough if you've never been tested?
All perks related to expedition participation are subject to the success or failure of our fund raising campaign. If we don't come close to our funding targets we will be forced to modify the quality and quantity of expeditions. Whatever happens our philosophy is to be creative in adversity and so we will make the best of whatever situation we find ourselves in. Expeditions are slated to occur in the summer of 2014.
If we get support far above the requested amount we will consider organizing elite expeditions utilizing experienced participants who we know can handle the profound physical and mental challenges. These expeditions would last at least 24 hours.  
 
If you do not like the requirements and demands of the Dinosaur Expedition option you can chose the Dinosaur Adventure, just ""Vote for the Therizinosaurus"".  With this perk you and five other people are entitled to a two hour adventure, summer 2014 and one Dinosaur Expedition Field Bag. You will be contacted to arrange a time and date for your adventure. Remember if we don't come close to our fund raising goal the duration and quality  of the adventure component of your perk will be adversely affected. You don't want to go on a dinosaur expedition and not see any dinosaurs!
TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW ABOUT THE DINOSAUR EXPEDITION. THE MORE FUNDING WE GET, THE BETTER THE EXPERIENCE!
All those supporters selected to go on an Expedition can opt for the two hour adventure. Please give us atleast 48 hours notice of any changes.

 Who is Robert Vowles?

I have a curriculum vitae the Coen brothers could turn into a screen play. I've done every kind of theater from Murder Mysteries and Improv to absurdist Ionesco.  As a special effects model maker I've worked on everything from TV shows to ad campaigns. I've earned a contractors top rate and as a blue collar labourer I've made minimum wage. You could say I have a well rounded perspective on the working world.
In the early nineties I got heavily involved in theme park design and promotion. This culminated in my leading a team of twenty-eight top creative and professional people as project manager for the Labyrinth project. This concept called for the creation of a vast complex of historical venues featuring interactive live theater seamlessly integrated with completely themed simulator rides. No theater seating! The action would have propelled people on to all manner of conveyances from horse drawn wagons and old sailing vessels  to space ships. In fact the experience would have been so realisitc that people would not have realized they were on simulator rides. The 250 million dollar Labyrinth was never built, but I learned many valuable lessons and I have applied them in developing my latest project.
 
 
 
                         THE BIG VISION.
 
The purpose of this Indiegogo Campaign is to introduce a revolutionary, twenty-first century theme park project. It is revolutionary because it is everything that twentieth century theme parks are not.    
 
It can be built for less than ten percent the cost of a traditional park, it is environmentally sensitive, there are no lineups, no price gouging and it recognizes that people are not the same as they were in 1955; nor is the social fabric or the technological infrastructure. The rigid architecture and operating structures of the traditional theme park mitigate against a full realization of the potential of the internet. Look at a contemporary theme park and it's like the internet was never even invented. 
 
In our proposed park the visitor's experience will be so personalized and so compelling that their adventure acquires significant entertainment value and can be live streamed to the internet on a pay for view basis. But people half way around the world won't just be watching, they'll be participating. Welcome to the world's first wired theme park. Share with your friends, family and the whole world.
 
Honestly who would pay to see someone on a roller coaster or dark ride? But they would pay to see a real time adventure as exciting as any movie. Welcome to the age of live movies.
 
Our ultimate goal is to break the monopoly the big entertainment companies hold over the multi-billion dollar theme park industry by building an attraction for less than fifty million dollars. Our philosophy is to stress programming and special effects and minimize the amount spent on costly infrastructure so damaging to the environment and investor's nerves. This project marks the evolution of the theme park from an obsession with physical architecture to a story architecture bolstered by an evocative wilderness and astounding special effects.
For those interested only in the dinosaur expeditions and adventures skip to: The Perks and everything after that.
 

  Business Revolution

 
Since the early days of the theme park industry it has been a cardinal rule that attractions should be built to accomodate peak day attendance. With their fantastic architecture and sophisticated ride infrastructure this is a costly precept. But it has generated enormous profits for large entertainment companies and made theme parks an enduring part of modern culture.
In the last twenty years increasing costs and economic instability have thrown the viability of theme parks into question. Disney's California Adventure, Bonfante Gardens and the ill fated Hard Rock Park are glaring examples of the perils of contemporary theme park development. Only companies like Disney have the resources to spend a billion dollars in one year on damage control.   
 
Rather than build an attraction where the visitor experience is oriented around costly architecture and ride technology; capital assets that must be built to accommodate massive numbers that are only present 20 to 30 percent of the time. We propose a park where the experience is oriented around out door adventure. This requires a minimum of expense. In fact we propose to create both the biggest theme park in the world and the least expensive. We can absorb huge numbers, but when our park is only a quarter full we are not bleeding money because a billion dollars in capital assets is under utilized.
 
In our park there are no fairy tale castles or towers of terror. There is only powerful immersive experience and the truly unexpected. Venture back into time 65 million years when predators had 8 inch fangs and browsing herbivores weighed as much as a herd of elephants. Excitement comes from interacting in a myriad of ways with these strange denizens of the park; dinosaurs. Weird, wonderful, dangerous and always on the move! 
 (To see how Theme Adventures uses theme park industry equations to evaluate the viability of a dinosaur park in the Chattanooga, Tennessee market place, hit the Gallery tab at the top of the page and go to Files. The ""Adding Up the Numbers"" document comprises one section of the Theme Adventures, Labyrintyme Dinosaur Park business plan). 

 Theme Park Revolution

While balancing the heavy demands of personal and professional responsibilities I have devoted a tremendous amount of time over the last twenty years to developing a new kind of theme park. I reject the traditional  theme park model with its cacophony of themes and frenzied, effects driven rides. In contrast I propose an attraction with one comprehensive theme. Visitors are invited to immerse themselves in this alternate reality for extended periods of time. They not only participate, they help shape the course of events. In this attraction special effects are in the service of story elements, not the other way around.
The Labyrinth was one incarnation of this new kind of theme park on the road I took to the Dinosaur Park concept; an attraction that saves money and drastically decreases damage to the natural environment by having a minimal infrastructure. Traditional theme parks literally gut the natural world as they create hugely expensive artificial paradises. The possibility of building a theme park is no longer the monopoly of an exclusive club when hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure are no longer required.
An ecologically friendly business model that can be adapted to the unique requirements of developing countries could open the door to large scale ecotourism. By increasing the perceived value of disappearing natural systems we recalibrate the calculations of cash strapped local governments in favour of ecologically sustainable development strategies. Such approaches could also help lift underemployed populations out of recurring cycles of poverty and overpopulation.

Participation
The elements of sharing, proactive behaviour and empowerment are part of people's everyday lives as they play their computer games, share music with friends and decide moment to moment what they will watch, listen to and participate in. I propose to weave these elements into the dinosaur theme park. What better way to begin than with a series of expeditions into a wilderness inhabited by these most fascinating and dangerous of creatures.  The plans for the eventual park are on the drawing board, thousands of hours have yet to be committed and yet people will be experiencing the sharp edge of what the park will someday offer. This is product development with the customer at the heart of the creative process. With live streaming to thousands of potential customers watching and sharing their brutally honest evaluations, we truly open up the creative process. With engagement on many levels we achieve a quality of participation that excites public interest and informs our creative process.
In many ways this project is inspired by the empowerment brought about by the internet age. It is also inspired by a less positive manifestation of the new web world. A significant number of people have become so consumed with their electronic gadgets they are increasingly alienated from their own physicality and their place in the natural world. We hope that our project can play a small part in helping to reverse this trend.
 
Why Dinosaurs?
I am a science fiction enthusiast, I don't know how many times I've watched the Alien movies. You could call me a history buff. I read every book in Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series and hungered for more. Why develop another dinosaur attraction when this theme has been done to death? As well there are  many exciting themes that have not been exploited, why not do one of these? 
First of all, other themes I'd like to explore require too much infrastructure. The cost is prohibitive. The dinosaur theme requires minimal infrastructure and results in less environmental impact. The second reason I chose the dinosaur theme arises from the glaring fact that no dinosaur attraction, no dinosaur event, no dinosaur movie correctly portrays the scientifically established behaviours and capabilities of the clade dinosauria. Certainly it is true that my attraction can't possibly recreate their lost world even if I have live dinosaurs. Be that as it may, the attraction I propose by having dinosaurs outside in a wilderness location, moving rapidly and behaving naturally, will come closer to capturing the essence of dinosaurs than any previous portrayal.
You can have the most sophisticated animatronic T Rex in the world, but if it's shuffling about letting 10 year olds stroke it's snout, then it is really nothing more than a scary looking puppet. In our attraction no one will be allowed anywhere near the T Rex. In our attraction if you find yourself in the presence of the T Rex you will understand primal fear.
                           
                      Outdated T Rex Illustration
 
The T Rex (Regina) and the Expedition for Knowledge.
(By all estimates the female T Rex was larger than the male, hence Tyrannosaurus Regina).
We hope to have many different types of dinosaurs for expedition participants to study and observe. In fact by your level of support you will help to determine what kind of dinosaurs will inhabit the dinosaur wilderness.  It is my advice to anyone hoping to join an expedition that they avoid providing any support for a T Rex cloning program. An examination of the historic T Rex will validate my advice and also underline my declaration concerning the inaccuracies of past T Rex portrayals and by extension the numerous flawed depictions of dinosaurs prevalent in popular culture.
Through fossil forensics we have discovered healed wounds on large herbivores that could only have come from a T Rex. In this case tooth size and shape are the smoking gun. This evidence would seem to close the debate over whether the Rex was a carnivore or merely an opportunistic scavenger. All physiological evidence seems to point to an extremely active and hungry carnivore. This behaviour in a creature weighing upwards of 8 tons would definitely pose a danger to humans. How much danger?
To appreciate the horrible death potential posed by a full grown  or even a half grown Tyrannosaur we need to examine its capabilities. For our purposes it is instructive to contrast the scientifically established capability with a portrayal in popular culture. I'm sure everyone remembers the scene in the first Jurassic Park movie when Dr. Grant was standing beside the overturned jeep with Hammond's granddaughter. There in front of them stands a hungry T Rex. Apparently the lawyer was merely an appetizer.
The good doctor advises the girl that the Tyrannosaurus can't see them if they don't move. Of course he means voluntary movements, but of course there are many involuntary movements and I'm afraid the T Rex was equipped to see all of them. This terrifying animal had depth perception superior  to other carnivorous dinosaurs. With its perfect binocular vision it had a canny ability to judge distances, a useful capability for an apex hunter. The eyes themselves were incomparable. Imagine a hawk with binoculars and you get some appreciation for  the Rex's visual acuity. So I'm afraid Dr. Grant the Tyrannosaur can see your chest move as you breath, every twitch of your face, every micro movement of your eyes. He sees about as well as it is possible to see.
The olfactory capability was every bit as formidable. Imagine an 8 ton blood hound, but keep in mind the nostril separation in this hound from hell allowed for 3D olfactory perception. He could smell a triceratops fart from a mile away and move towards its author with the accuracy of a guided missile. This sensory arsenal was completed by a sense of hearing of incomparable acuity. In a scientifically accurate Jurassic Park the T Rex could hear the breathing, the heart beat and the gas bubbles percolating in the churning guts of the three terrified humans by the overturned jeep. So if we neutralize for a moment Spielberg's genius for drama and rely on cold hard science there is no dramatic moment by the jeep. Nature's ultimate predator eats the goat, the lawyer, Doc Grant and the two kids in seconds. But is he fast enough to catch the jeep? The latest research seems to indicate that we have underestimated the tail muscle mass the T Rex used to maximize speed by as much as 45%. So before the jeep even gets up to speed its 3 occupants are already dead.
If Dinosaur Expedition supporters indeed successfully vote for a T Rex a series of protocols will be established invoking distance requirements, the  use of visual, auditory and olfactory decoys and the utilization of a number of repellent technologies. If the Rex demonstrates predatory behaviours towards expedition participants we will get to the nearest ATV trail and rendezvous with our ATV mobile security detail for extraction. Under no circumstances will firearms be utilized. The potential for making a tragic situation catastrophic is too great. Andy's AK47 is permanently retired.
Thinking a dinosaur's appearance tells the whole story makes about as much sense as saying a man's shadow explains his essence. For too long the entertainment business has been satisfied with shallow depictions and the complex reality of these creatures has been ignored. They knew the T Rex was a monster, but even the paleontologists weren't sure how dangerous was the beast. With the latest research it's hard to imagine it could be any more lethal. The more we find out about both carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs the more we develop respect for these awesome creatures.
Instructed by the facts and emboldened by the capabilities science gives us, we will attempt to do justice to the T Rex and creatures like it. The educational possibilities are electrifying!

The Perks
Your support will give us the financial muscle we need to make the expeditions and adventures possible. But your personal commitment to the project is what brings it to life. It is through the Indiegogo perks that together we mediate how you as a supporter will engage with the project. If you desperately want to go on an expedition your chances improve as your level of support increases. If you just can't afford to give much support, but still want to improve your chances you can seek an endorsement from a higher level supporter. If this higher level supporter is selected for an expedition their endorsement can greatly improve your chances. (Higher level supporters are allowed to give one endorsement).
 If you wish to support the project with a generous contribution, but have no desire to wade through mosquito infested swamps looking for predators the size of school buses, then we'll reward your generosity with a fine prehistoric themed gift. If you're too old or out of shape to go on expeditions yet long for adventure, we will provide a modified experience of shorter duration.
The Indiegogo perks empower our supporters in other ways. Each level of support is a vote for a particular type of dinosaur. The greater the support at a particular level, the better the chance the dinosaur associated with that level will be cloned, (if second generation hatched or if already in existence, selected for survival in our park). The votes of higher levels are worth more than lower level votes. Higher levels of support are also associated with all types of significant participation in the project, not necessarily involving exposure to the dinosaur wilderness. This could involve designing a shirt for our online store. If the shirt design is selected it will be featured, we will provide links to your online dinosaur themed store and other exciting perks. Another perk offers the supporter the opportunity to create video content for our online channel. Selection criteria would include things like the educational content, entertainment value and quality.
At the higher levels, expedition participation is guaranteed and the potential for significant involvement with the dinosaur theme park is offered. In all cases more support means better perks, but merit is also an important factor. Chose a perk that allows you to highlight your best qualities and you may find yourself an important part of the project. Don't delude yourself. Do not involve yourself at a level of support involving participation and assume you will be successful if you have no experience in the skill associated with that type of participation.

Certain key members of the project team are in place, but the funding we receive will determine the ultimate size and character of the group. The skills involved in designing and implementing important parts of the project are highly specialized and require appropriate remuneration.
We are very lucky indeed to have Walter Klassen join the team as technical advisor. He is a legend in the movie business and his encyclopedic technical knowledge will bolster the entire dinosaur expedition project. (To see a recent newspaper article on Walter hit the link on my 21st. June, 2013 favourite tweet). https://twitter.com/RobertVowles
This project is temporarily dominated by old guys and Juliana Vowles provides the priceless perspective of a young professional. She has work experience in the public and private sector and her perceptive mind and limitless creativity is an invaluable asset.
A number one priority for the project team is to make the expeditions as safe as possible. Alex Smith in his role as Program Coordinator for Recreation and Leisure at Fleming College in Peterborough, Ontario is in an ideal position to provide us with qualified expedition team leaders.
It is my intention to employ a substantial number of students in parts of the project where I believe their contribution will be invaluable.. I have been in touch with the wireless technology department at Fleming and they are interested in making involvement with the project both a school assignment and a source of summer employment for students. 
 
As project manager it is my job to mediate between three fundamental objectives.
            1. The creation of mind blowing experiences.
            2. The maximization of supporter participation.
            3. The ultimate goal of creating the worlds first, truly 21st century
                 theme park.
It is essential that I put together a team that can help me reach all these goals. It is my belief that this project will generate opportunities that will make project goals not only achievable and mutually supportive, but also a means to undreamed of potential.  
                 

 Expedition Rules

There are rules that must be followed, failure to follow rules may result in the immediate termination of the expedition. Here's a sample of some of our rules.

You must be 18 years or older at the time your expedition is to occur.          
No firearms or weapons of any kind on the expeditions, you do not want your adventure to end in a long stay in a Canadian penal institution.
No alcohol or illicit drugs are permitted.
No racist, sexist, inflammatory comments or abusive behaviour is allowed.
No reckless behaviour likely to result in injury to yourself or others.
No smoking; the threat of forest fire and the health concerns of others make this rule non-negotiable. 
No persons with a history of serious mental instability or violent criminal behavior.
No pregnant women.
It is imperative that you obey the orders of your Team Leader at all times. 
If you don't like rules and resent being told what to do that's fine, stay home we don't want you on the expeditions! DO NOT misrepresent your physical or mental condition when being interviewed. All those selected for expeditions will undergo VIGOROUS TESTS prior to transportation to the Dinosaur Wilderness. You will only be inconveniencing other people and jeopardizing your own participation at a level that is safe for you by being loose with the truth.
 
The Comprehensive Liability Waver
All businesses especially themed attractions go to great pains to insure their facilities are safe. Artificial worlds are constructed specifically for we fragile humans and still accidents happen. It seems everyone has a  lawyer ready to seek their version of justice. If you wish to go on our expeditions have no illusions, there is danger and you will be signing away your legal redress; wild animals are dangerous, insects and snakes are poisonous, water can drown you and tree roots can trip you. In addition I brew my coffee boiling hot, if you spill it on yourself don't call your lawyer.
Our eventual attraction will have adventures for visitors with safety concerns. But at this stage we can only offer expedition participants blood, toil, tears and sweat with the chance of incredible thrills. If you have concerns you should seriously consider staying home. All expedition participants will be required to sign our comprehensive liability waver without exception.
 
The Dinosaur Expedition Budget
I have endeavoured to create a flexible cost structure that allows me to adapt to the input that I get from my supporters and satisfy my own requirements. My primary goal and the goal that sustains all others is the goal of demonstrating that dynamic immersive entertainment of extended duration has huge potential. This goal is balanced by the need to move as many supporters as possible safely through the expedition process. With so many unknowable elements it will be fascinating to see how the project eventually manifests itself.
 
Dinosaur Creation and Care Costs
Depending on the choices of our supporters the
dinosaur population will incline towards many smaller                     
dinosaurs on the one hand or a few large dinosaurs                      $205,000
at the other extreme. The more meat eaters selected
the more dangerous the expeditions. Remember if no
herbivores are selected the only readily available  food
source will be you. 
 
Labour Costs 
For the kind of quality experience we are proposing you
need trained, high quality staff. One of our goals is to
provide people with decent well paying jobs. The fact this               $86,400                            
goal rebounds to the benefit of our supporters is a double
good.
 
Vehicles, Maintenance and Fuel  Costs
A full range of vehicles from trucks to ATVs will be required
for the movement of staff, equipment, expedition participants         $45,000
and security personnel. We will economize by the utilization of
used, rental and leased vehicles.
 
                     
 
Electronics and Support Services
This category includes everything from rugged out door
video cameras with Wi-Fi capability to receivers, production              $42,850
switchers and communication devices. A number of exciting
new technologies are available from companies like Livestream
and GoPro. 
 
Administrative Costs
This refers to all costs associated with planning, implementing
and managing the project. This includes everything from fully          $70,000
equipped office and shop space to insurance and security.
 
Wilderness Access Cost 
Getting access to wilderness acreage large enough to provide
safe habitat for dinosaurs is one of the most daunting obstacles    $100,000
facing this project. A dinosaur reserve of this scale requires well
over a 1000 acres to be viable. Presently we are looking at sites 
in Ontario, Canada.
 
Expedition Gear Cost
In this category is grouped all materials necessary to equip a
series of expeditions into a wilderness inhabited by dinosaurs.
This includes everything from top of the line first aid kits to             $14,299
equipment to ward off dinosaur attacks. It has been our policy
that expedition participants bring their own camping equipment.  
However if we exceed our budget goal we would consider providing 
Tentsile suspended tents. 
 
Perk Cost
When it comes right down to it the entire project is a
large perk for a relatively small number of people.
Those who are not selected to go on expeditions                            $50,000
or who chose not to go on expeditions also need to 
have their generosity and perspicacity rewarded.  
 
         
          . 
 
Cost of Fees
Indiegogo and money transfer fees.                                             $46,181
                                                   
                                                      TOTAL                 $659,730

 
Problems With This Project
When presenting a business plan to investors it is customary for entrepreneurs to detail the weaknesses in their plans. I believe this courtesy is also appropriate when seeking funds from the Indiegogo community. You value your money and you deserve the straight goods.
The idea of giving the public immersive, participatory adventures of extended duration has great appeal. If it wasn't so fraught with difficulties the theme park industry would have done it long ago. Our intention of live streaming the action adds an additional element of peril to the endeavour.
Unfortunately it is the case that some people when given the opportunity to participate  see this as a license to behave in a boorish and infantile manner, amusing themselves at the expense of everyone else. On a number of visits to theme parks I observed such behaviour on rides where limited participation was offered in the pre-shows. In my time as a carnival showman I experimented with crowd participation and developed a number of effective tactics for insuring the entertainment went in a positive direction. Of course I didn't have to deal with live dinosaurs.
In the context of the overall project there is a vast, untested strategic vision that must be implemented. Challenges involving staffing, equipment selection and expedition management are all very daunting. Situating the project in a wilderness location poses risks to supporters and staff. Although every reasonable precaution will be taken, anything can happen. The logistics of getting injured or ill participants to a hospital are complex. In regards to wild non-dinosaur animals I have been venturing into wilderness areas all my life in groups and also alone.  I find even the larger animals want nothing more than to avoid humans at all costs. If you extend them the same courtesy there shouldn't be a problem.  
Perhaps the biggest failing of this project is the potentially large number of small supporters who want to go on expeditions and aren't selected because of inadequate capacity. There is a simple mathematical reality at work here. The cost for one person to go on an expedition is well over a thousand dollars if we take into account total project cost. My good intentions can't change this fact. It takes a large number of small supporters to pay for one expedition participant. It is my hope that premium perks attract enough big supporters to underwrite the involvement of lesser supporters. If you're a small supporter you can have a huge impact on the project if you tell the right person that the DINOSAURS ARE BACK  and there's an  EXPEDITION !  
If we reach our funding goal and our fixed capital costs have been met a higher a percentage of any additional funds can go towards operating costs. That means more financial resources can be directed towards insuring a higher percentage of lower level supporters can go on additional expeditions. Unfortunately management and safety issues preclude us stuffing existing expeditions with more people.

Underneath that, there is an extra-padded heel cup that delivers 3D support to your arch and works in conjunction with the flymesh for and incredibly soft feel.

</div></div>","If you are, great! You are going to love what we have in store for you. Sadly, though, there are many people who cannot answer ""yes"" to this question honestly. They are not doing what they need to do to protect their feet – two of the most precious things any of us will ever be able to call their own. Ask anyone who has suffered a severe accident to their feet: their lives are never quite the same. For anyone who has not put thought into what they are doing to keep their feet safe and functional, we can only encourage you to think of often you use them and to imagine how your life would change without them.

<p>This is not our first time manufacturing an awesome pack and our last product launch went off without a hitch or delay. We have a wealth of experience understanding what goes into a project like this.

<p>Delays: The unloading and loading of shipping containers aren't always the most streamlined or timely processes and labour strikes or general tardiness can cause our large metal box full of backpacks to sit at the port waiting for unloading longer than we'd like. We bake delays like this into our schedule, but they can sometimes be longer than even we'd accounted for.</p>
<p>Acts of God: We distribute our gear from Vancouver, Canada, which sits uncomfortably close to the locked Juan de Fuca plate and within a major earthquake zone. It's been a few centuries since this plate slipped and we're hopeful it will stay locked for some time. The NHL playoffs have concluded and the risk of angry fan riots during our proposed timeline is also quite low. In the unlikely event that the God(s) do not smile fondly upon us, we'll work together with you to persevere and get you your Kiri..</p>

</div></div></div>","Kiri is the most customizable daily backpack ever created. Magnetic buckle technology allows you to swap effortlessly between your choice of Kiri kits designed for all of the adventures that fill your life. Whether it's an overnight trip, an afternoon by the beach, a morning photo expedition, or a hike in the mountains, there is a kit for any adventure!Our goal is to make it easy for you to explore your world and leave it a better place. That’s why every Kiri backpack provides a child in the developing country of Cambodia with essential school supplies for a year. By supporting education, your backpack helps build a better world. Access to education means brighter futures for each of these students, and on a global scale helps to increase environmental awareness, work towards gender equality and decrease poverty rates.We use only the highest quality materials, from premium Fidlock buckles to YKK zippers and rugged Kodra nylon. Our products are built to last! If your Kiri backpack (or any of your kits) are defective, we’ll fix them. If we can’t fix the problem, we’ll replace the product. That’s our promise to you.   At Banana Backpacks we believe that your everyday backpack should be manufactured to the highest standards, in a way that you would be proud of. That means the highest manufacturing quality and highest ethical standards are non-negotiable.Our manufacturer is located just outside the busy metropolis of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. They have been one of the world’s best bag manufacturers for over 15 years and specialize in building highly technical outdoor gear, where product failure can result in life or death. We’re talking extreme backcountry avalanche bags and mountaineering packs. They’re also incredible at building camera gear designed to keep insanely expensive technical equipment safe. With this kind of expertise, you can rest assured your gear was built to last.They also pride themselves on their safe working environment, low employee turnover (a proxy for factory worker satisfaction), and support of the local community.We’ve spent the past year working alongside them as we developed the Kiri Collection to make sure you can feel as good about the way your gear was made as you do when those silky soft straps hang from your shoulders.In May 2018, we began selling our 60L travel pack, the Khmer Explorer, through our website after funding our first production run with a combination our own life savings and direct pre-orders. We delivered our first production run on time and without a delay (a streak we intend on keeping!).One year later, we're ready to launch our second, more ambitious backpack collection. And that's where you come in! We would humbly like to ask you to join our adventure.As a full collection with large minimum order quantities, we can’t bring Kiri to life without your help. So if you can, please back our project and pre-order your Kiri. Having tested it vigorously over the last year (on opposite sides of the world), we can wholeheartedly say it will change the way you explore!We’re so excited to have you here, and we can’t wait to continue the Banana Backpacks journey with you. If you have questions, feedback, or just want to say what's up, reach out to us at help@bananabackpacks.com. We’ll get back to your question as soon as this two sibling team can! Happy exploring! :)Michael & AnikaP.S.

 With breakthrough Graphene nanotechnology and advanced Teflon-coated outer shell and stylish design, you'll be comfortable in all weather.     5x THINNER THAN A WINTER COAT& JUST AS WARMHow is it possible?  Other Winter CoatsUse bulky fillers such as cotton or down, and heating elements with the same technology we've had since the early 1900's. Graphene Heating TechnologyHumbgo Coats use graphene nanotech material that's as thin as paper and as durable as a diamond, while being safe enough for precise, even heat.GRAPHENE: THE STUFF OF SCIENCE FICTIONScientists won the Nobel Prize in Physics for Graphene technology in 2010. Graphene is a form of carbon consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in an hexagonal lattice. It is the strongest material ever tested, efficiently conducts heat and electricity, and is nearly transparent.While Scientists have theorized about it & known about it for years (think of the graphite in your pencils), we've never been able to produce it -- until now. [Graphene on Wikipedia]Humbgo is one of the first ever to use this lightweight, durable material for its excellent heating capabilities and incorporate it into our jackets. TEFLON-COATED TO REPEL EVERYTHINGCleaner & Dryer than Leading Coats   WARM UP FAST WITHPRECISE HEAT CONTROLFaster & More Efficient than Ever Before 3 HEAT SETTINGS
HEAT THERAPYWe follow the philosophy of heat therapy pads for for aching muscles and joint pain. Heat panels are located near the abdomen, and in the center of the back.The Humbgo XG is not meant to be a replacement for any doctor’s treatment or physical therapy, but it can provide additional heat relief similar to that of a heating pad or Icy Hot. PACK LIGHT & SAVE MONEY:A COAT FOR ALL WEATHERThe Lightweight XG Jacket Packs Some Heavy Features WORKS WITH ANYLARGE CAPACITY POWER BANKWorks with any USB Power Bank with 5V Output.

<p><br/>In december 2012 me and my good
friend Edi saw the series “Long Way Round” starring Ewan
McGregor and Charlie Boorman traveling around the world on
motorcycles. After seeing all the episodes of the show, we quickly
ended up asking ourselves the question: “Why can't <i>we</i> do a
long trip on motorcycles together?”</p>
<p><br/>We pretty much decided right there
and then that we would plan and have an adventure on motorcycles on a
17000 kilometer trip, with a maximum period of 6 weeks. <br/><br/>We
first thought we would go Scandinavia round and then decided on
Iceland round, but found that those trips might not give us the
specific adventure we're looking for. <br/><br/>One day my friend Edi
asked me, “How about the Black Sea? We start in Norway, drive
through Denmark, Germany, Zcech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania,
down to Bulgaria, on to Turkey and through the whole country and then
up to Georgia driving through the whole country again and spend some
time on the mountains there before we go to Russia and to Chechnya to
visit our friend Husein, further we go to Sochi and up through Russia
to Estonia and take a Ferry to Stockholm in Sweden to drive the last
750 kilometers back to Kristiansand! Boom!”<br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/591168/files/20140520001504-Trip.jpg?1400570104"" src="""" style=""""/></p>I loved the idea and the planning
began! <br/><p></p><p><br/>My friend had alot of the important stuff ready, like
the motorcycle license and the motorcycle. <br/>Mind you everything is
very costly here in Norway!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For myself, the plan seemed much more
far fetched. I first had to complete the car license, then the
motorcycle license and THEN buy a motorcycle. That again, cost me
tens of thousands of kroner here in Norway. 
</p>
<p><br/>It took me one year and I pulled
through, getting all licences I needed and a motorcycle. At that
point the adventure got more feasible to me and I continued to work
for having the money necessary for fuel, food, housing, all the gear
for the trip and necessary mods for my bike. <br/></p><p>It is now the 19<sup>th</sup> of May

left to route. Our Adventure starts on 28<sup>th</sup> of June and we
are planning to be back on 10<sup>th</sup> of August.   <br/><br/>On
the trip itself we are going to film everything with two GoPro Hero 3

<p>These are the components for our next project, the Cynaps Assist Next Generation Headset. It is already fully tested and working, both for exceptional clarity and feedback elimination. Both sides are charged and operate independently, and the headset will be reversible, meaning if you only want to use one side, you can, and you'll double the battery life. For example, if you only want to use the right side always, once the battery is depleted, you can switch sides so the second (full) module is placed on the right side and continue using it twice as long. The average battery life is about 4-6 hours depending on the noise level, meaning both sides used individually can easily last a full day. </p>
<p>Both the Cable Connected Headset and the Assist Next Generation Headset are 90% complete (the boards have been populated, tested and now being actively produced), and the only thing we lack at this point for both products to be finished are the housing, packaging and instructions.

<p>Tracing Nepal is a sixteen day experience which will bring eight non-resident Nepali youths together and take them on a journey to explore and experience Nepal like never before. During the journey, the young individuals will be visiting Maya Universe Academy in Tanahun where they will be roughing it up in village home-stays and be involved in teaching, construction and farmwork. The second phase of the experience will take these youths to Taplejung, Eastern region of Nepal where they will live it up locally in Sablakhu village. Activities range from ""dhan ropain"" (rice plantation) to assisting at the heavily populated local government school Singhadebi Madhyamik Vidhyalaya. The final part of the experience consists of downtime at Nepal's famed The Last Resort. </p>
<p>Tracing Nepal aims to uncover the real Nepal for these youths who have spent majority of their years living outside of Nepal. Through this experience, I hope they too will foster a deeper relationship with Nepal and play an active role in the future of our country. </p>

<li>Educating and increasing awareness about the reality of these diseases and the opportunities that are available for those who suffer.</li>

<p>We are passionate about this topic and it is a large part of who we are. We know that with our influence and brand we can make a difference.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485653669/bhgjxvnkjyfv1cjoy4ws.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Warranty</h3>
<p>We believe that products should be made with the highest of quality and standards. We stand by our products and their quality and durability. There is a 1 year warranty on all Dulo products. </p>
<p>Warranty does not cover:</p>
<ul><li><p>Any damage on any part of the wallet resulting from abnormal/abusive use, lack of care, negligence, accidents.</p></li></ul>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Where is Dulo Supply Co. Headed?</h3>
<p>We want to have a full line of the Nash Wallet, expanding into different styles and colors. We have plans to create other wallet designs and expand into other accessory categories if we are funded. We want to evolve into a well known lifestyle brand for the everyday adventurer while being able to make a difference in the world. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Funding Details</h3>
<p><strong>Pledge Amount.</strong> Our pledge amount is $10,000. Manufacturers are only able to produce items with a bulk order. This allows them to keep costs lower and make money. Ordering in mass amounts requires capital. That is why we need the $10,000. These funds will allow us to order in bulk quantities and begin to properly develop Dulo Supply Co. and our business model.</p>
<p><strong>All-or-Nothing.</strong> We have elected to go with the ""all-or-nothing"" strategy. This means that if we don't raise our $10,000 goal we get NO MONEY! If we raise $9,999 we will receive no funds and all backers will not be charged for their payments. We chose this strategy over the ""flexible"" funding strategy because it ensures that you:</p>

Wallet Specifications


Social Impact
We have formed a strategic partnership with the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA). You can visit their site here and learn more about what they do. 
5% of proceeds from all purchases will go towards initiatives such as:

Funding research on better alternatives for treating mental disorders. 
Supporting those diagnosed with a mental disorder for therapy or medication.
Educating and increasing awareness about the reality of these diseases and the opportunities that are available for those who suffer.

We are passionate about this topic and it is a large part of who we are. We know that with our influence and brand we can make a difference.

Warranty
We believe that products should be made with the highest of quality and standards. We stand by our products and their quality and durability. There is a 1 year warranty on all Dulo products. 
Warranty does not cover:
Any damage on any part of the wallet resulting from abnormal/abusive use, lack of care, negligence, accidents.
Where is Dulo Supply Co. Headed?
We want to have a full line of the Nash Wallet, expanding into different styles and colors. We have plans to create other wallet designs and expand into other accessory categories if we are funded. We want to evolve into a well known lifestyle brand for the everyday adventurer while being able to make a difference in the world. 
Funding Details
Pledge Amount. Our pledge amount is $10,000. Manufacturers are only able to produce items with a bulk order. This allows them to keep costs lower and make money. Ordering in mass amounts requires capital. That is why we need the $10,000. These funds will allow us to order in bulk quantities and begin to properly develop Dulo Supply Co. and our business model.
All-or-Nothing. We have elected to go with the ""all-or-nothing"" strategy. This means that if we don't raise our $10,000 goal we get NO MONEY! If we raise $9,999 we will receive no funds and all backers will not be charged for their payments. We chose this strategy over the ""flexible"" funding strategy because it ensures that you:
1. Get your wallet if we reach our goal.
2. Won't be charged for your purchase and will not receive the product if we don't reach our goal. 
This leaves very little risk to the buyer, if any at all. We want to make sure that our buyers have confidence that they will only be charged  and receive their product if we reach our funding goal. Our relationship with you is EVERYTHING. Without you, this could not be possible.
The Perks
Because you are taking a chance on us, we want to reward those who are the first to support us! The first 200 wallets purchased will be 33% off the retail pricing:

100 buyers for the Nash Solo Wallet

The stainless steel reflector above the stones directs heat back down to cook the toppings. With the door closed, the vent at the top allows just the right airflow for the heat to circulate and create uniform cooking throughout.The griddle simply fits in place of the pizza stones. Ridged BBQ side or flat skillet side up depending on your menu. Light with the auto-ignition and you're ready for a BBQ in minutes. The built in trough catches grease for easy cleanup and the stainless steel handles make for easy transition from grill to skillet and back.


The lava stone is a slab of specially cut basalt rock from an old volcano. Heat it in your Firepod for about half an hour and using the special gloves supplied, lift it out and place it on the board. A quick wipe with olive oil and you're ready to start cooking. Prawns and strips of meat cook in seconds and everyone can cook their food as they like it.  The stone will fast-cook for about 30 minutes and then stay hot enough for slower cooking for a further 20 minutes, although you can always pop it back in your Firepod to heat it up.  Savoury PizzaThe really great thing about pizza is that we can all have them exactly how we like them. Thin and crispy, deep base, 00 flour, gluten-free or sourdough; pesto, passata, bechamel or marinara sauce;  vegetarian, seafood or meaty toppings. With The Firepod you can cook at a steady 620ºF (320ºC) allowing your dough to rise as it cooks. In less than four minutes you will have a delicious pizza with a light, crispy base, and perfectly cooked toppings. It honestly couldn't be easier to cook perfect pizza - as you can see above, our customers confirm this.Sweet PizzaSweet pizza is coming back into fashion and is a fun snack or dessert to share with family and friends. Here we used a normal 00 base with Nutella, very ripe pear, California strawberries and a few chocolates for luck. Honey, fruit jam and yoghurt can work well with fruits too.BBQ GrillJuicy marinated steaks, locally farmed sausages and all of your BBQ favorites are easy to cook on the ridged side of the griddle. We've included a trough to catch excess fat while cooking and the stainless steel handles mean you can lift the griddle off and take it to your table, still sizzling. Now you can really show off at your next tailgate party.SkilletFor a really fun breakfast, turn the griddle over and cook pancakes, bacon and eggs on the flat skillet side. This is great for cooking seafood too. Cooking something that you need your own pan for? The skillet side is perfect for frying a few onions, heating up soups and stews or heating up a kettle of water. You can even get fancy with more exquisite dishes like risottos, curries and paellas. Hot Rock CookingCooking on a slab of hot lava stone is a fun and healthy way to cook. Simply heat the volcanic stone in the Firepod, place onto the special board and take to your table, indoors or out for cooking. Seafood, meats and vegetables all cook very quickly, sealing in flavor exquisitely. You can cook whole steaks or cut them into strips and they cook in seconds.

<p>We designed a tent that adapts to you, whether you’re alone, with a friend, or camping with a party of four. Think of it as three unique tents in one.</p>
<p>Our system consists of a two-person, standalone tent, its rainfly, and a snap-in “alcove” that seamlessly integrates with the tent—doubling the sleeping and storage space.</p>
<p>Now you don’t have to own more than one tent just because the size of your group and sleeping scenarios change from one outdoor adventure to the next.</p>

Think of it as three unique tents in one.
Our system consists of a two-person, standalone tent, its rainfly, and a snap-in “alcove” that seamlessly integrates with the tent—doubling the sleeping and storage space.
Now you don’t have to own more than one tent just because the size of your group and sleeping scenarios change from one outdoor adventure to the next.

































We’re committed to creating a positive social impact through our health, education, and livelihoods initiatives. Each year, we designate 10% of our profits to provide targeted grants to nonprofits and partners that have demonstrated outstanding impact, agility, and persistence.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>As with any product development, unforeseen challenges are possible. The good news is that this team of professional industrial designers, engineers, programmers, sales, and marketing experts have brought hundreds of consumer products from concept to market over the last 30+ years, so we have a pretty good idea of what lies ahead and we're well equipped to deal with whatever comes our way.</p>
<p>That said, there are common obstacles that sometimes come up, which include:</p>
<p>• Design changes or minor adjustments to improve the final product causing delay</p>
<p>• Manufacturing, component, and material shortages from outside suppliers</p>
<p>• Shipments that are lost or damaged</p>
<p>• Customs delays</p>
<p>• Fulfillment: Delivery delays due to weather, strikes, inaccurate address information, doorstep package theft, etc.</p>
<p>• Unforeseen international delivery issues (such as Antarctica).</p>
<p>As always, we are dedicated to making sure you know what is happening every step of the way. We'll be updating all of you ""Adventurers"" regularly and letting you know exactly what's going on as Ra development progresses.</p>
<p>Help us make the world's first strap light by selecting and clicking a ""GET THIS PERK"" button, and by helping us spread the word through sharing this IndieGoGo page and linking over to our Facebook and Zyntony.com web pages. This networking will help us to reach our funding goal.</p>

In the case that your Voice recording has been missed your Voice message can be played again as many times as you like.In some cases when the frequency band is too congested our smart protocols wait for a free window and send Voice messages with hardly any noticeable delay. This is not an issue with Text messages and location data, as these are much smaller packages of data.


 
With Gotoky you can have private 1-to-1 or Group Chats with anyone from your Gotoky’s app Contact list. For Group Chats just create a Group and add people contacts  to the Group. You can even start communication from the navigation screen.
All chats and data transfers are private and secured, meaning whatever you say or send can be heard or read only by your selected counterpart. Gotoky enables up to 40 private 1-to-1 Voice Chats and more than 300 private Text Chats at the same time.""Emergency""Location Beacon FeatureThe “Emergency” Location Beacon is a “just-in-case” feature - when activated your call for help is being automatically and repeatedly broadcasted and relayed over the Gotoky network - so each Gotoky, including those beyond your range, will receive your distress call.  User with activated ""Emergency"" Location Beacon visible on the map, with all his dataWhen other Gotokys receive the “Emergency” Location Beacon a big full-screen orange alert window appears to notify Gotoky users that someone is in distress. By clicking on the distressed person's information Gotoky users can easily check the location of the person or even start a conversation.This particular feature can be activated by Gotoky itself- if the smartphone’s battery is being empty or even when the smartphone is broken - more on this in the section below “Gotoky can work without smartphone”.Navigation FeatureThe Gotoky mobile app provides very easy to use and informative Navigation. Each Gotoky around you regularly sends its own GPS location to other Gotokys, so all Gotokys in the area know of each other even if you don’t know them personally.  GPS location broadcasting can be also manually turned off, if the user doesn't want to be visible or tracked.You can view all Gotokys around you on the FREE off-line preloaded maps. When you are somewhere off-grid in the wild it is good to know that somebody is nearby even if you can’t see them.Route recording: start and end points, naming the route, adding points of interestThe Gotoky Navigation app also comes also with a Route recording feature. You can easily record all your movements from start to finish. And it’s easy to add some notes to the route as well.  Gotoky acts as an autonomous relay device

Used as an autonomous relay device: Create your own mesh network or double your communication range. 

Activation of “Emergency” Location Beacon: Just press the button, even in the case that your phone is out of the battery. The device stores the last GPS location received from your smartphone (the device itself doesn't have a dedicated GPS module).
It can autonomously receive and store up to 1000 text messages without being connected to your smartphone.


 
 With the Gotoky Relay function you can create a Mesh Network and double the range of your communication: Gotoky automatically and securely relays your Text Messages over other Gotokys in your area - your range can be extended beyond point-to-point, and you can make your own network.To ensure that your message really gets to your friends who are usually moving we have developed very smart protocol with intelligent algorithms which double-check network delivering potential. We are also working hard to provide this feature for Voice Chats.  Gotoky connects to your iOS or Android Smartphone wirelessly via Bluetooth-LE (Low Energy, 4.2). The device must be within an 8m or 25ft range of the smartphone. When connected, use the installed mobile app to communicate with other Gotoky users.Gotoky works over a licence-free standard UHF frequency band and the range is limited by the law of the country you are operating in.It is a dual band device meaning that it works in the EU regulated frequency band of 868 MHz and on US regulated frequency band 915 MHz.The range really depends on number of obstacles around you - the more the obstacles - less of the range. The device will auto-tune itself to the appropriate frequency band and power output based on location where it’s being used.All data is end-to-end encrypted and its technology patent pending. Our solution is CE certified, in accordance with European legislation; FCC certification is in process.  NATURAL DISASTERGotoky is a perfect “just in case device” if /when natural disaster strikes, which can often leave cell services crippled and unreliable for days, weeks. OUTDOOR ADVENTURESSkiers, campers, trekkers, climbers, hikers and other nature enthusiasts are now able to connect and feel safe in places where they used to be completely isolated. TRAVELERSGotoky can be extremely useful for travelers - being abroad and wanting to communicate for free rather than paying exorbitant roaming charges. FUNCTIONAL BUSINESS TOOLGotoky is also useful as a functional business tool for certain occupations where workers need to stay in constant group communication in remote working environments. Gotoky is a dual band device; It is powered by long lasting battery of 72 hours of usage, charged over micro USB port

 The design concept is based on the idea of a wave (radio) captured by a product Gotoky. The front surface represents the wave as a communication element - it is a shining surface; a clear, pure drop of a wave which creates more waves gathered around one circled form (the button), symbolising the touch of a human finger as the touch of communication.The matte vessel of the surrounding and back surface of Gotoky signifies the strong base of the product: its quality, stability and perfection; its strength as a tool for off-grid communication. Gotoky is a pocket-sized device, both waterproof and dust-resistant.IP56 water and dust resistance​ Silicone strap comes in three colours: Red, Turquoise and Lime.It has a special loop so that it can be hung from a belt, a bag or even somewhere on a tree or other object in order to get a better signal.It can be hungIt comes in a box of 2 Gotokys (Red and Turquoise strap ) and in a box of 1 (Lime strap)The box MEDIA MARKT INNOVATIE LABGotoky was presented for showcasing this September in Media Markt (Europe’s largest retailer for consumer electronics) store in Eindhoven, Netherlands and in October in Wilrijk, Belgium within their Innovative Lab.   Our story begins with total-mountain-lover Denis’s personal experience (Denis - CEO) of getting hurt while hiking one winter day in the Alps.

<p>USING THE SCORKL WITH AND WITHOUT SCUBA TRAINING  </p>
<p>The Scorkl is safe, easy and for everyone. However, if you are not a trained scuba diver there are restrictions on use and risks to be aware of. <b>Misuse of the Scorkl can be dangerous</b>. Whilst decompression sickness (more commonly known as “the bends”) isn't much of a risk because of the depth and time restrictions of such a small cylinder, <b>pulmonary damage (lung expansion injury) is nevertheless a risk if a user holds their breath during ascent or ascends too quickly.</b></p>
<p>Non-scuba trained users <b>should not use the Scorkl below 3m depth</b> or more than five times in one day. <b>Staying above 3m dramatically reduces this risk of pulmonary damage (although does not eliminate it entirely)</b>. Each purchaser will be provided with an information kit informing them of this (and other) risks of using the Scorkl as well as strategies to avoid them. These strategies will include, but not be limited to,<b> staying above 3m in depth and not holding one's breath and/or exhaling during ascent, and not ascending too quickly. </b> </p>
<p>Scuba-trained users will be able to use the Scorkl below 3m at their discretion but they too will be warned of the same risks.  </p>
<p><b>The Scorkl is only intended for shallow water use.</b> We recommend that <b>scuba-trained users not use the Scorkl below 10m</b> and that <b>non-scuba-trained users stay above 3m</b> in depth as mentioned above.  </p>
<p>Each Scorkl comes fitted with a pressure gauge so that the user can know how much air remains in the cylinder at any time.  </p>
<p>AIR QUALITY</p>
<p>The Scorkl can be filled either directly from a scuba tank or from our high-pressure hand pump. If filled from a scuba tank that itself has been filled by a commercial compressed air supplier, the air can be assured to be of good quality because of industry supplier standards. These standards are concerned mainly with carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oil and water levels. Since the Scorkl hand pump doesn't have as many working parts as a mechanical dive compressor, and is muscle-powered rather than petrol powered, the risk of contamination from latent carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is dramatically reduced. This is the same for oil contaminants. Notwithstanding this, each Scorkl pump comes fitted with an air filter which is comprised of the same materials, and performs the same function, as a filter fitted to a mechanical dive compressor. The Scorkl filter should be replaced after fifty refills and extras will be available for purchase after the conclusion of the Kickstarter campaign.  </p>
<p>EQUIPMENT STANDARDS, CARE AND MAINTENANCE  </p>
<p>The Scorkl cylinder and regulator are made to the same international specifications and standards as normal scuba cylinders and regulators and need to be visually inspected and/or tested as regularly as the guidelines in your country require (some are different). This may be as regularly as every year or every one hundred dives.  </p>

EverLights can be cut at any point in the string of lights and any leftover lights can be used somewhere else on your home. Need to jump to the second story or to the next roof line? Unlit jumper cables can also be cut to custom lengths and hidden out of sight. Everything you need is included in your kit.</p>

<p><b>UV Resistant Poly-carbonate Caps - </b>The caps that secure EverLights in place are made with the highest degree of UV resistant poly-carbonate plastic on the market. This is the same material your headlights are made of. Meanwhile, all the wires are safe from the sun and out of sight.</p>
<p><b>Water-tight installation –</b> Worried about punching holes in your gutters? Don’t be. For years gutters were installed with gutter nails much larger than the ¼” hole needed for EverLights. Not only will EverLights not affect the structural integrity of your gutters, but they also will not allow any water to get out. A tiny O-ring on each light ensures a water-tight seal at every light location.</p>

<b>Safety –</b> EverLights are powered by an incredibly low 5 volts, which is well below the standard for low voltage according to the National Electrical Code. This means there is never any danger to you or your family. In fact, you can touch the wires when they’re powered and not feel a thing. <br/>

In most cases, you can do all this without needing to add anything but the lights to your house. The existing gutters and flashing both hold the lights and conceal the wires. It's a perfect pairing.Nearly invisible in the day. Radiant at night. EverLights are both discreet and bold... but only when you need them to be. UsesAs icing on the cake, EverLights can be used for birthdays, weddings, etc… Install Easy to set up so you have more time for what matters most. Our patent-pending technology makes a permanent, smart and affordable home lighting solution a reality. EverLights was designed so that anybody with any DIY ambition could install it themselves. Our convenient layout tape shows you exactly where each light goes.Simply drill at the marked locations with the included bit, insert the lighting assembly through the backside of the hole, and twist on the cap. It really is that simple.Features: Many Features. Many Uses. EverLights aren't just safer, less work, and a more affordable solution for Christmas lights. There's so much more you can do.Wi-fi Control– Wondering what makes the whole system work? This beautiful box in your garage. The EverLights box projects its own Wi-Fi network which you can control from up to 300 feet away. Oh, and it backlights with whatever pattern is currently displayed on your house. Who says hardware needs to be an eye-sore?

Customized For Your Home - EverLights are designed to be custom cut and fit to any home. This means no more extra lights dangling from the edge of your gutters. EverLights can be cut at any point in the string of lights and any leftover lights can be used somewhere else on your home. Need to jump to the second story or to the next roof line? Unlit jumper cables can also be cut to custom lengths and hidden out of sight. Everything you need is included in your kit.
IP68 Waterproof – EverLights are manufactured to the highest standard of liquid protection for electronics. IP68 means your EverLights can be continuously immersed in over 1 meter of water. Do your gutters hold that much water? Yeah, neither do mine. 


Weather-proof Design - with a working temperature range of -40 through 176 degrees Fahrenheit, EverLights are designed for whatever climate you happen to live in, even if you go through dozens of freeze/thaw cycles each year.


    A frozen solid section of gutter demonstrating the abuse EverLights can take.

UV Resistant Poly-carbonate Caps - The caps that secure EverLights in place are made with the highest degree of UV resistant poly-carbonate plastic on the market. This is the same material your headlights are made of. Meanwhile, all the wires are safe from the sun and out of sight.
Water-tight installation – Worried about punching holes in your gutters? Don’t be. For years gutters were installed with gutter nails much larger than the ¼” hole needed for EverLights. Not only will EverLights not affect the structural integrity of your gutters, but they also will not allow any water to get out. A tiny O-ring on each light ensures a water-tight seal at every light location.

Safety – EverLights are powered by an incredibly low 5 volts, which is well below the standard for low voltage according to the National Electrical Code. This means there is never any danger to you or your family. In fact, you can touch the wires when they’re powered and not feel a thing. 

Commercial Applications – We’ve been saying “house” this entire time, but replace that word with “business” and it works just as well. EverLights are the perfect way to bring a little extra attention or class to your commercial establishment.

<p>BluLocks is an elegant lock, which is neatly integrated in the BluLocks bike. Get a fast &amp; fun city bike with the lock you’ve always wanted. No more stress about leaving your bike alone. The lock has two main functions; blocking the pedals and locking the plug-in chain. </p>

<p>We are two mechanical engineers. We like to dream about finding solutions, but our real joy comes from really solving the problem. As we are from the Netherlands we naturally have a passion for bicycles. We complement each other with different skill sets, making us a good team. However, our company couldn’t be a success without the help of our partners and of course all of our BluLocks friends.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445082302/ixptdjvcr1jktft1agwz.png"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""/>
<p>When one of us had his sixth bike stolen in less than a year, we decided it was time for a change. Bike theft is huge problem In Holland. We did some research and found some shocking statistics. Each year about 900 thousand bikes get stolen. That is 90% of the 1 million bikes that are sold. But the problem isn’t limited to The Netherlands. Worldwide 15 million bicycles are stolen each year.</p>
<p>We also took a closer look at bike locks, and found that they had hardly changed over the past 50 years. All locks on the market are bulky, ugly and inconvenient and most of all, not secure. They can all be cut with simple bolt cutters or a grinder. Even a hacksaw will do the trick.</p>
<p>That’s why we wanted to create something different. We wanted to create a lock that would make bike theft as unrewarding as possible. We thought about many different ways to do this. Ranging from frame tubes that could be used as chain locks, to entire foldable frames. After months of hard work and multiple prototypes, we finally had what we wanted. A slim lock that is integrated within the bicycle frame.</p>
<p>We partnered up with CEAD, a prototyping company, to help us create the lock we want. Together we’re testing and finalizing the final product. We used the latest technology, including laser cutting and 3D printing to make sure we can start producing as soon as possible. We also started working with Birota, an experienced bike manufacturer, to guarantee a high quality bike with premium components. With the help of YES!Delft, the largest tech incubator from Europe, we made sure we can realize our product. </p>

<p><strong>What exactly is a BluLocks bike?</strong></p>
<p>The BluLocks bike is a light, agile city bike which can be configured as single-speed or fixed gear. The simplistic and clean look make you stand out of any crowd. A fast Dutch no nonsense bike with a lock integrated in the seat tube, making it beautiful, easy to lock and especially secure. With the plug in chain you can easily lock your bike to anything you want. The steel frame is decked out in top quality components. A great bike, you’ll never have to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>How does the thief know the bicycle is locked?</strong></p>
<p>Because the bicycle is locked to a pole, or a tree with the plug-in chain lock. The thief can't take the bicycle without inspecting it first. Thieves specialize in a single type of lock, for instance a chain or U-lock. Our lock is new and unusual, so a thief will always choose an easier target.</p>
<p><strong>Will I be able to build this lock inside the bicycle I currently own?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment. A few adjustments have to be made to the frame in order to make the lock as secure as possible. But no need to worry, we are full of surprises.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if I lose my keys?</strong></p>
<p>If you claim a BluLocks frame or complete bike, we will register the keys as soon they arrive in our assembly line in the Netherlands. If you happen to lose all of your keys you will be able to request a new set of keys online. On request we can send you as much spare keys if you want, but we will have to charge you for the extra production and shipping costs.  </p>
<p><strong>What happens if the lock would fail?</strong></p>
<p>Our biggest priority is making the lock highly reliable. However, every product is prone to failure. We designed the system to make it replaceable, but only if you have possession of the keys. So no worries, the bike won't be useless in the highly unlikely event of failure. </p>
<p><strong>Is the lock resilient against dust and moisture?</strong></p>
<p>Because the lock is placed rather low, it is prone to dirt and water. We are aware of this problem and are therefore only working with materials that can withstand more extreme environments. But like any bike or lock it is not immune to wear. It's always a wise idea to take good care of your bike and it's lock. </p>
<p><strong>Can I lock the pedals in more than one position?</strong></p>
<p>The lock is designed in such a way you can lock the pedals in almost any position. You don't have to struggle to get your pedals in a certain position when locking your bike. </p>
<p><strong>What colour combinations can I make?</strong></p>
<p>We offer you two main different perks. You can choose between receiving just the BluLocks frame and the frame with all the extra parts. The frame is available in two colour options; black &amp; white. The sets with parts are available in the options anodized red &amp; blue. When you select the full bicycle you will be able to make all 4 colour combinations; white/red, white/blue, black/red, black/blue. The price is not affected by the colours you choose.</p>
<p><strong>What frame sizes are available? </strong><br/>The frames come in the sizes 57 cm and 60 cm. When you submit your colour preference you can also submit  your frame size. <br/></p>
<p><strong>When can I expect my BluLocks bike?</strong></p>
<p>Our plan is to start production in January. Of course we are not immune to set backs, but we’ve put a lot of effort in our planning and expect no major delays. Depending on your location you will receive your perk in February. As soon as we are ready to ship we can deliver orders from the Netherlands within a week. The Benelux and other adjacent countries will take a maximum of two weeks. The rest of Europe and the world can be subject to customs and different shipping companies. Therefore shipping can take up to a month.</p>
<p><strong>What are the shipping costs?</strong></p>
<p>The shipping costs depend on your location. If you live in the Netherlands or Belgium the shipping costs are included. Every other locations outside the Netherlands are specified for each perk. The costs cover the shipping costs only. Any other tax, import or custom costs are not covered. Those depend heavily on your location and can't be taken account of by us. Make sure you are up to date with your countries custom rules before ordering a perk! </p>
<p><strong>I've claimed a discount coupon, how do I receive my discount?</strong></p>
<p>If you've claimed your discount coupon you received a verification email from us. If you didn't please contact us, so we can make sure you don't miss out on your discount. You might also qualify for the discounted bike if you're a member of a certain community. To claim your discount you have to select the 359$ 'discounted bike' perk. If you want the deluxe discounted bike add 30$ to your contribution manually (making 389$). The discount is only applicable to the regular and the deluxe BluLocks bike and is <b>not </b>usable for the 'double the fun' or the 'collectors package'. If there is any misunderstanding about your qualification of the discount of other issues, please contact us. We're happy to help!</p>
<p><strong>What retail price do you expect?</strong></p>
<p>Our current plan is not to do any retail selling. The BluLocks bike can solely be claimed during the Indiegogo campaign. After that we might remain In-demand, but only for a certain period of time. We want to focus on continuous development of the product, so we can make our lock available for all kinds of different frame types. We can also maintain a full focus on the customer care of all our backers.</p>

</div></div>","For the first time ever it's possible to have an extremely safe lock that won't compromise the beauty of the bike

BluLocks is an elegant lock, which is neatly integrated in the BluLocks bike. Get a fast & fun city bike with the lock you’ve always wanted. No more stress about leaving your bike alone. The lock has two main functions; blocking the pedals and locking the plug-in chain. 

The mechanism blocks the pedals and locks the plug-in chain in one smooth turn of the key. With the plug-in chain you can attach the bike to external objects like trees, poles or other bikes. To access the lock you would have to breach the frame, making the bicycle worthless.We’ve integrated the lock inside a fast and beautiful city bike. Normally you would have to buy a bike, and a separate lock. Now you get a beautiful bike with an exceptional lock.



The bottom bracket lock

Can’t touch this
As badly as thieves might want to lay a hand on this lock, it remains untouchable unless they were to breach the frame, making bike theft useless. 
Safety without compromise
For the first time it’s possible to have an extremely safe lock that won’t compromise the beauty of the bike.
Swift and smooth
Lock your chain and crank in one smooth turn of the key, taking you about two seconds tops

The plug-in chain
Taking flexibility to the next level
The plug-in chain allows you to secure your bike to any object, anywhere, anytime.
Safe and sound
The chain is made of high class steel. It’s covered with a good looking protective sleeve.
Defy bike thieves
Even if a thief were to cut through the chain, there would still be a piece of chain dangling out of the side of the frame, making it very unattractive to sell.

The flip-flop hub

Double the fun
The rear wheel’s flip-flop hub gives you the freedom to ride the way you want. A quick flip of the wheel switches between Fixed Gear and Single Speed.
Fixed gear
The direct transmission gives you a greater feel of the road and more control over your speed. Riding fixed will help you develop your own rhythm and style.
Single speed
Enjoy your bike the way you’re used to. The gear is set to a very pleasant speed, ensuring you a relaxing and comfortable ride, at all times.

How do I submit my colour preference?We will contact you after you've selected your perk. Then you'll be given the opportunity to submit the colours of your choice. 
What frame sizes are available? 
The frames come in the sizes 56 cm and 60 cm. When you submit your colour preference you can also submit  your frame size. What is Liggi?Liggi are Dutch strap-on bikelights with an innovative design, also originated from Delft. The straps prevent theft or loss. They are designed by Studio Hikari x AXA.Which mudguard will I get?The clever emergency bicycle mudguards that's there when you need it, gone when you don't. Easy to install, no tools required. The 'ass-savers' are designed by 5 Swedes from Göteborg. 




We are two mechanical engineers. We like to dream about finding solutions, but our real joy comes from really solving the problem. As we are from the Netherlands we naturally have a passion for bicycles. We complement each other with different skill sets, making us a good team. However, our company couldn’t be a success without the help of our partners and of course all of our BluLocks friends.

When one of us had his sixth bike stolen in less than a year, we decided it was time for a change. Bike theft is huge problem In Holland. We did some research and found some shocking statistics. Each year about 900 thousand bikes get stolen. That is 90% of the 1 million bikes that are sold. But the problem isn’t limited to The Netherlands. Worldwide 15 million bicycles are stolen each year.
We also took a closer look at bike locks, and found that they had hardly changed over the past 50 years. All locks on the market are bulky, ugly and inconvenient and most of all, not secure. They can all be cut with simple bolt cutters or a grinder. Even a hacksaw will do the trick.
That’s why we wanted to create something different. We wanted to create a lock that would make bike theft as unrewarding as possible. We thought about many different ways to do this. Ranging from frame tubes that could be used as chain locks, to entire foldable frames. After months of hard work and multiple prototypes, we finally had what we wanted. A slim lock that is integrated within the bicycle frame.
We partnered up with CEAD, a prototyping company, to help us create the lock we want. Together we’re testing and finalizing the final product. We used the latest technology, including laser cutting and 3D printing to make sure we can start producing as soon as possible. We also started working with Birota, an experienced bike manufacturer, to guarantee a high quality bike with premium components. With the help of YES!Delft, the largest tech incubator from Europe, we made sure we can realize our product. 



What exactly is a BluLocks bike?
The BluLocks bike is a light, agile city bike which can be configured as single-speed or fixed gear. The simplistic and clean look make you stand out of any crowd. A fast Dutch no nonsense bike with a lock integrated in the seat tube, making it beautiful, easy to lock and especially secure. With the plug in chain you can easily lock your bike to anything you want. The steel frame is decked out in top quality components. A great bike, you’ll never have to worry about.
How does the thief know the bicycle is locked?
Because the bicycle is locked to a pole, or a tree with the plug-in chain lock. The thief can't take the bicycle without inspecting it first. Thieves specialize in a single type of lock, for instance a chain or U-lock. Our lock is new and unusual, so a thief will always choose an easier target.
Will I be able to build this lock inside the bicycle I currently own?
Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment. A few adjustments have to be made to the frame in order to make the lock as secure as possible. But no need to worry, we are full of surprises.
What happens if I lose my keys?
If you claim a BluLocks frame or complete bike, we will register the keys as soon they arrive in our assembly line in the Netherlands. If you happen to lose all of your keys you will be able to request a new set of keys online. On request we can send you as much spare keys if you want, but we will have to charge you for the extra production and shipping costs.  
What happens if the lock would fail?
Our biggest priority is making the lock highly reliable. However, every product is prone to failure. We designed the system to make it replaceable, but only if you have possession of the keys. So no worries, the bike won't be useless in the highly unlikely event of failure. 
Is the lock resilient against dust and moisture?
Because the lock is placed rather low, it is prone to dirt and water. We are aware of this problem and are therefore only working with materials that can withstand more extreme environments. But like any bike or lock it is not immune to wear. It's always a wise idea to take good care of your bike and it's lock. 
Can I lock the pedals in more than one position?
The lock is designed in such a way you can lock the pedals in almost any position. You don't have to struggle to get your pedals in a certain position when locking your bike. 
What colour combinations can I make?
We offer you two main different perks. You can choose between receiving just the BluLocks frame and the frame with all the extra parts. The frame is available in two colour options; black & white. The sets with parts are available in the options anodized red & blue. When you select the full bicycle you will be able to make all 4 colour combinations; white/red, white/blue, black/red, black/blue. The price is not affected by the colours you choose.
What frame sizes are available? The frames come in the sizes 57 cm and 60 cm. When you submit your colour preference you can also submit  your frame size. 
When can I expect my BluLocks bike?
Our plan is to start production in January. Of course we are not immune to set backs, but we’ve put a lot of effort in our planning and expect no major delays. Depending on your location you will receive your perk in February. As soon as we are ready to ship we can deliver orders from the Netherlands within a week. The Benelux and other adjacent countries will take a maximum of two weeks. The rest of Europe and the world can be subject to customs and different shipping companies. Therefore shipping can take up to a month.
What are the shipping costs?
The shipping costs depend on your location. If you live in the Netherlands or Belgium the shipping costs are included. Every other locations outside the Netherlands are specified for each perk. The costs cover the shipping costs only. Any other tax, import or custom costs are not covered. Those depend heavily on your location and can't be taken account of by us. Make sure you are up to date with your countries custom rules before ordering a perk! 
I've claimed a discount coupon, how do I receive my discount?
If you've claimed your discount coupon you received a verification email from us. If you didn't please contact us, so we can make sure you don't miss out on your discount. You might also qualify for the discounted bike if you're a member of a certain community. To claim your discount you have to select the 359$ 'discounted bike' perk. If you want the deluxe discounted bike add 30$ to your contribution manually (making 389$). The discount is only applicable to the regular and the deluxe BluLocks bike and is not usable for the 'double the fun' or the 'collectors package'. If there is any misunderstanding about your qualification of the discount of other issues, please contact us. We're happy to help!
What retail price do you expect?
Our current plan is not to do any retail selling. The BluLocks bike can solely be claimed during the Indiegogo campaign. After that we might remain In-demand, but only for a certain period of time. We want to focus on continuous development of the product, so we can make our lock available for all kinds of different frame types. We can also maintain a full focus on the customer care of all our backers.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Old Ways</h3>
<p>Right this
second, if you wanted to drink flavored water from your hydration pack you’d
need to dump flavored powders, syrups, or tablets directly into your reservoir.
The reservoir lining can absorb the flavors, colors, and sugars staining your reservoir even after you’ve spent a solid hour scrubbing
it out. Infuze is here to make all of our lives easier.
Infuze keeps your reservoir pure and ready to go by keeping your flavor
contained and portable and your reservoir safe and sanitary.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452561628/ejhuu5rhuzbltaidvkb6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> On extended backpacking trips, your pack's weight is crucial-- that's why Infuze is small less than 5 ounces 2 of those ounces being the Infuze Flavor Cartridge. You'll never have to pack extra bottles or sports drink again.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How It Works</h3>
<p>It's pretty simple really. Infuze is designed to use the natural suction when you drink from your hydration pack to infuse your water with flavor, electrolytes, vitamins, and energy. It attaches directly to the end of your hydration pack's hose, you can drink plain water as if nothing was there, then when you want simply turn the flavor dial to the perfect flavor intensity for you and the concentrated syrup is picked up and mixed with your water right before it reaches your mouth. All back flow is prevented, so your reservoir is kept clean and pure. You can switch off the flavor at any time using the Flavor Dial to go back to drinking that clean and pure water and switch it back on when you need some flavor infusion. Cartridges are all interchangeable, and you don't need to wait until they're empty to swap 'em out for a new flavor. If you find yourself out of flavor cartridges, you can leave your Infuze attached. It is designed to live on your pack, with or without a flavor cartridge. You can keep drinking water through it, just be sure to flip the Flavor Dial to 'off' before.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452647709/itskzeht97gsysxwdzt6.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; width: 107px; height: 214px;""/> </p>
<p>The Infuze easily attaches to any hydration pack and gives you easy access to the Infuze Flavor Dial to adjust the water to your perfect flavor. Flavor and Water on demand.</p>

<br/><p>The
Infuze lifestyle began in the Silicon Slope's shadow: in Utah’s High
Uintas near King’s Peak. Danny Noall was hiking with his father on their annual
backpacking trip. The excursion covered 36 miles (58 km.) in 36 hours, and they refilled
their reservoirs with any water they could find. During that expedition, Danny
had plenty of time to contemplate his hydration experience. Anyone who’s taken
their hydration packs on an extended trip outdoors will know exactly what Danny
was thinking, “You can filter out the dirt, but you can’t filter out the
taste.” 36 hours in the
wilderness and 12 liters of water later, Danny had an idea. He wanted to <i>Infuze</i> his water as he was drinking.</p>

He wanted to know if it was actually possible and worth his time. He entered Infuze in 5 business competitions: the concept took 1st place in 4 of them and took second place in the 5th by only one half of a point. Danny conducted over 250 personal interviews with outdoor enthusiasts and spoke with industry experts. He had a conversation with his beautiful wife, Britt Grace, to see if they were alright with the risk of investing their life savings and potentially having 10,000 of the Infuze systems sitting in there garage.

glass of water or your favorite water bottle. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Can the Infuze leak when it's on my pack?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> We have designed the system to be as fail proof as possible.

is the industry standard (literally 99%) for hydration packs.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q:</b> When can I expect my Infuze?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>We are hoping to be faster, but you should expect to see your Infuze
delivered in July. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q: </b>What takes so long on the development?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Our biggest time constraint is the injection mold. These are
extremely expensive (over $100k), and they take a few months to get dialed in
exactly where we need them to be. This is why we need your help on
crowdfunding: to build the mold and get it to you as quickly as we can! </p>

</div></div>","INFUZE: Outdoor Hydration RevolutionizedSee the Infuze Fully functional prototypeWhen you
take your hydration pack through the wilderness, you want to drink something
that tastes good, replenishes the electrolytes you’ve lost, and has some
vitamins for good measure. For the first time ever, you can do that without
damaging your reservoir. And it’s easy.


Infuze
attaches to the end of your hydration pack's hose and flavor is picked up by the water you
are already drinking. There’s no back flow and no risk of staining your
reservoir with flavors and colors—the only thing touching your reservoir lining
is the pure water you fill it with.

Media and Competitions

Grow Utah Concept-2-Company Competition-  Grand Prize Winner
SharkTank at USU - Grand Prize and Crowd Favorite
Opportunity Quest at USU - Second Place Winner
Get Seeded Program University of Utah - Winner of two rounds of funding


The Old Ways
Right this
second, if you wanted to drink flavored water from your hydration pack you’d
need to dump flavored powders, syrups, or tablets directly into your reservoir.
The reservoir lining can absorb the flavors, colors, and sugars staining your reservoir even after you’ve spent a solid hour scrubbing
it out. Infuze is here to make all of our lives easier.
Infuze keeps your reservoir pure and ready to go by keeping your flavor
contained and portable and your reservoir safe and sanitary.





 On extended backpacking trips, your pack's weight is crucial-- that's why Infuze is small less than 5 ounces 2 of those ounces being the Infuze Flavor Cartridge. You'll never have to pack extra bottles or sports drink again.


How It Works
It's pretty simple really. Infuze is designed to use the natural suction when you drink from your hydration pack to infuse your water with flavor, electrolytes, vitamins, and energy. It attaches directly to the end of your hydration pack's hose, you can drink plain water as if nothing was there, then when you want simply turn the flavor dial to the perfect flavor intensity for you and the concentrated syrup is picked up and mixed with your water right before it reaches your mouth. All back flow is prevented, so your reservoir is kept clean and pure. You can switch off the flavor at any time using the Flavor Dial to go back to drinking that clean and pure water and switch it back on when you need some flavor infusion. Cartridges are all interchangeable, and you don't need to wait until they're empty to swap 'em out for a new flavor. If you find yourself out of flavor cartridges, you can leave your Infuze attached. It is designed to live on your pack, with or without a flavor cartridge. You can keep drinking water through it, just be sure to flip the Flavor Dial to 'off' before.
 
The Infuze easily attaches to any hydration pack and gives you easy access to the Infuze Flavor Dial to adjust the water to your perfect flavor. Flavor and Water on demand.

    
Our patent pending check valve to makes sure flavor only goes to your mouth, not the reservoir.
    
The Cartridges are interchangeable so if you get tired of our Raspberry Lemonade, you simply pull the cartridge out and slip in another. 

Infuze Cartridges


We wanted the flavor cartridges to be as versatile as possible. Now you have flavor on demand: The Flavor Dial lets you choose flavor when you want it, and water when you don't. Simply turn the dial to let the flavor flow as you drink, or turn it off to go back to drinking water. 

The flavor cartridges are interchangeable. If you've been taking in raspberry lemonade flavored fuel for 25 miles (40.2 km.) and you need to switch to a mixed berry, it's as easy as swapping out cartridges. Just pop outs old and slip in whatever flavor your heart desires. 
Your health is important to us, and we wanted you to have the freedom to choose the ingredients you prefer. The Infuze Natural Line is made of all natural ingredients, no artificial food dyes, and no chemical sweeteners. The Infuze Performance Line includes all of the electrolytes and energy supplements that you need to be able to keep going strong during your adventures. Infuze comes in Five flavors Raspberry Lemonade, Lemon Lime, Mixed Berry, Kiwi Strawberry, and Pomegranate Mango. The Infuze gives you what you want when you want it.

<p><strong>Our mission is simple: To care for the world we love exploring.</strong></p>
<p> There is no escaping the fact that the products we choose to purchase will have an impact on the planet lasting far longer than we will. Plastic bottles take between 450 - 1000 years to decompose, yet 1,000,000 plastic bottles are purchased around the world every minute (that's 20,000 a second, in case you were wondering). Of those 1,000,000, at most only 7% will be recycled and the true number is probably frighteningly lower. The environmental impact of this catastrophe is only just beginning to be felt, but it is often seen most acutely as we travel the world and witness places of incredible natural beauty choking in plastic waste.</p>
<p>Evolve was founded by an environmental science teacher who heard the passionate outrage of his students loud and clear. We MUST change, or the world as we know it will not survive.That's why the Evolve adventure towel is made from recycled plastic waste. Likewise, we are committed to using recycled materials whenever and however possible in all of our future products. We're determined to make high quality, stylish travel gear in a way that benefits the environment.</p>
<p>We're also committed to leaving a positive and lasting impact on the environment through charitable work and donations.
