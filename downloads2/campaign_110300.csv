<p><strong>Over the past 50 years,</strong> feminism has built a social mythology where women are oppressed, and men are the oppressors. The result of this has not been some reward of equality for women though; instead, modern feminist culture demands that women deserve social, financial and legal privilege at the expense of men and boys. This has normalized the idea that men are little more than disposable wallets who must be censored and subdued, and naturally, men and boys have silently suffered unimaginable pain throughout this cultural agenda.</p>
<p>In today’s gynocentric Wild West, men get fucked over every day at work, in schools, and in courts and no one blinks an eye. This needs to change. The problem is not just the rise of feminism though, and this book expands into an exploration of the complex relationships between male and female nature, how we think, and why we think that way. It’s about why many people feel first and think later, how men can educate and protect themselves against a culture that doesn’t value them, and what an encouragingly positive future for men could look like.</p>

<p>Whether you identify as a feminist or not, the widespread culture of modern feminism has poisoned and compromised our human ability to think objectively, and the beast of feminism will never stop until it's starved of male victims. Women already have superior rights in Western countries, so you might ask, what does modern feminism ultimately want?</p>
<p>The answer is right in front of us every day: <strong>more</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>This book is, in so many ways, my life’s work</strong>. Granted, I’m only 44 years old, but I’ve been watching, examining and intently journaling about human behavior for decades.  For most of those years, I thought my writing was pointless, even obsessive, and that those millions of words and thousands of pages were wasted. It didn’t make much sense until I started writing Men are F*cked.​</p>
<p>For most of my life I've been a lone wolf, even in my marriage, and I never felt like I belonged to a group. I realize now that I simply belong to the tribe called Men, and Men have a huge problem. Feminism is the greatest shit test of all time, and we, as Men, have failed it. Feminism has walked all over us for five decades, and if we don't help bring sanity to a culture gone mad, no one will.​</p>

I haven’t spent a year writing this so you can bring a toilet roll of bullshit quotes to your next tea party; I’m writing this because I documented my entire journey, and I believe that what I have to say will genuinely help other men.​</p>

<p>We zijn al een jaar bezig en hebben dit project tot nu toe
zelf gefinancierd. De reiskosten lopen hoog op en het kost geld om het project

This book, addressing systemic violence both within El Salvador and globally, will bring you into the triumphant, complex, and resilient lives of women who are demanding <i>visibility.</i></p><h3>The Problem:</h3><p>When there are discussion panels comprised of each letter of the LGBTQIA spectrum minus the L, there is a problem. When fliers appear on the street, as they did in 2009, “announcing the coming of death squads for “gays and delinquents”” (<a href=""http://mashable.com/2016/02/15/at-the-devils-door/#o_YQDiW2isqd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2016/02/15/at-the-devils-door/#o_YQDiW2isqd</a>), there is a problem. When the global community holds the belief that lesbian, bisexual, and queer-identifying women do not exist in El Salvador, there is a problem. These are symptoms of systemic violence that is faced daily; violence that further inhibits a culture of peace in one of the most violent regions of the world.</p><h3>The Pleasure is Ours</h3><p>This book will fight for that peace and visibility by providing a opportunity for these women’s voices to travel the world. Comprised of mini-biographies written from in-depth interviews with over 20 lesbian, bisexual, and queer-identifying women, this book will tell their untold stories, but it goes beyond just the book. The act of learning to write your life story is one of healing and empowerment. The interviewees will participate in workshops to learn to write their life stories and replicate those workshops at book release events. Hard copies of the book will be distributed throughout El Salvador to workshop participants. <strong>The Pleasure is Ours</strong> addresses structural violence by taking another step in effective accompaniment, beginning with those who live this reality every day.</p><h3>We need YOU.</h3><p>We need your help to make this happen. In a country where women are excluded and their stories ignored, this treatment quickly escalates to death threat campaigns when you come out as someone society says you cannot be. <strong>The Pleasure is Ours </strong>redefines coming out in El Salvador as an experience of rejection, pain, and isolation and instead tells the stories of women whose coming out is an empowering experience of owning who they are in spite of the risk.</p><p>Inspired by this year’s slogan for the lesbian blockade in the 2017 El Salvador pride parade, the title of the book reflects on the current mindset of many lesbian, bisexual and queer women whose pride contradicts what we are led to believe about this conservative country. Support for this book provides an opportunity for women to break down those stereotypes by telling their stories and sharing those stories around the globe.</p><h3>Who am I?</h3><p>As someone who identifies as queer, I was drawn to find community in El Salvador when I moved here in 2014. I was oblivious to the existence of Salvadoran LGBTQIA community, believing, like many US born people, that these “types of communities” couldn’t exist in a country “like this” because it would be too dangerous. I quickly recognized how ignorant, limiting, and US-centric my beliefs were. The first time I talked about this project was when a close friend of mine was asked to be on a LGBTQIA panel at the last minute because the organizers realized they didn’t have a single woman on the panel. We talked about how women are excluded without a second thought and I shared my own ignorance upon entering the country. Throughout these years the conversation has been repeated again and again: at the bar, in LGBTQIA events, in groups with folks from the US; it is a constant topic of conversation and that conversation is what led to this book.</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>The women who participate in the making of this book will have the opportunity to share their stories throughout the country and around the world. In El Salvador, <strong>The Pleasure is Ours</strong> will contribute to systemic change where the voices on the margins will be made central.  El Salvador’s single story is one of gangs, violence and poverty; the bilingual publishing of this book with further create a rift in that belief and demand a more complex vision of the country. Beyond the violence, there is a rich diversity of people filling this land and <i>your support</i> for <strong>The Pleasure is Ours</strong> will impact the individual participants, the women who will find community in these stories, and the structures that prevent these stories from being part of the mainstream.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499101437/wtculnzegm3fwipmtwzz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><h3>The <strong>timeline</strong>:</h3><p><strong>July 2017</strong>: Conduct informal working groups with Salvadoran LGBTQ organizations to co-develop interview questions and discuss the optimal layout of the book.

<h3>Who am I and why am I doing this?</h3>
<p>My name is Phillip Anderson and I’ve been writing about politics in New York state for over a decade. My writing has focused mainly on corruption, ethics and good governance issues as well economic and social justice. Along the way, I even spent some time in government as New Media Director for the New York state Senate.</p>
<p>I’ve long chronicled the career of Governor Andrew Cuomo and how he has dealt with or often simply ignored many of the issues that matter greatly to New Yorkers and progressives across the country. I’ve written for years about the ethical shortcomings and scandals, the petty and vindictive feuds with progressives and progressive policy itself, the legislative cloak and dagger fights, all the progressive policy victories so often championed by Governor Cuomo that never seem to stand up to further scrutiny, and, last but hardly least, the all consuming political ambitions of a man that now wants to be the President of the United States.</p>
<p>All of this is why I feel compelled to write this book and share what I’ve learned over the years with all of those potential Democratic primary voters who maybe haven’t followed Andrew Cuomo as closely as I and others have. I’ve written roughly 700K words about Cuomo over the years, all with links to primary sources, and I’ve come to understand a great many things about the man. What I can tell you is that I feel he would be a terrible choice for the nation and an even worse choice for the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Rest assured, Andrew Cuomo is definitely running for president and voters across the country deserve to know much more about who he really is as both a politician as well as someone who would seek to lead the Democratic Party forward in the post-Trump era.</p>
<p>Your support for this project is absolutely vital in helping to make that happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What you'll be supporting</h3>
<p>By backing this project, you’ll allow me to take the time to assemble a clear and rational case for why Andrew Cuomo represents a politics that the Democratic Party and the country at large is leaving behind.</p>
<p>That said, let me be clear, I have no desire whatsoever to write a hit piece. This has been true for all my years of covering Cuomo. I believe the objective facts clearly support my thesis that Cuomo is the wrong candidate at the wrong time for the wrong party. I intend to make the case against Cuomo with facts, not hyperbole, not conspiracy theories, not with bullsh*t. When the governor and his crew come after this book, and they most certainly will, they will have to engage with it on the merits of the case, not on the fact that it is anyway unfair or speculative or factually incorrect.</p>
<p>And that’s why the case I will put forth has to be bulletproof. Your support for this project will allow me to engage an actual researcher. The book will be fully footnoted and fact-checked. It would be a waste of so much effort to write a book that can be picked apart because we didn’t get the facts right. That’s just not going to happen because the potential consequences are just too great. This is a serious endeavor and I intend to treat the entire enterprise with the seriousness it deserves.</p>
<p>In short, I plan on working my tail off to produce a book you will be proud to have supported.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>It's much more than just a book</h3>
<p>“The Case Against Andrew Cuomo” is also more than just a book. It will also be a living, continuously updated resource on the web with links, audio and video, and commentary as it happens*. The site, <a href=""http://anybodybutcuomo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">anybodybutcuomo.com</a>, is nothing but a splash page at the moment, but that will change in the coming weeks and months. A large part of this effort is to build an accessible and genuinely useful resource for potential voters but also for journalists as well. I’ll be putting my many years of experience running online campaigns to build out the site but also a social media element that will put accurate, actionable and shareable information in the hands of citizens across the country.</p>
<p>By backing this project, you’ll be supporting far more than simply a book.</p>
<p>*And yes, before you ask, this means The Albany Project is coming back as well.</p>
<h3><strong>But what about stuff? Do you have stuff?</strong></h3>
<p>We've got some great stuff for backers! The sticker is being designed at this very moment. It's a 5x2 inch oval. It's perfect for your car or your laptop or your dog (don't put stickers on dogs) or your guitar case or whatever.</p>

<p>Not bad, right?</p>
<p>One of the perks on offer is to have your name included in a special ""backers"" section of the acknowledgments. I fully realize that there are probably plenty of people who would very much like back this campaign in a significant way but have no desire to have their name included in this book. I fully understand. This is Andrew Cuomo we're talking about. If you would rather not have your name listed, just let me know. You know who you are.</p>
<p>We've got loads of other perks that you can check out over on the right and there will be more coming soon. As a certain US Attorney for the Southern District of Manhattan once said, ""stay tuned.""</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word! You can be of immense help by sharing this campaign with your networks. You can follow the book on <a href=""https://twitter.com/AnybodyButCuomo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter </a>and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/CaseAgainstCuomoBook/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>. You can put that sticker on your car and wear that shirt and when people ask you about it, you can tell them that you know who Andrew Cuomo really is. You can tell them why you think he'd maybe not the best choice for the country or the Democratic Party in general. You can tell your friends in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina and elsewhere that maybe they should consider someone else.</p>

All of which operate from a secret control room deep beneath the White House.Each book will feature a historically accurate quote from the various presidents with underlining themes and a positive message/life lesson.Aside from being a fun read, this series is intended to be partly educational-providing important historical facts, quotes and dates. Even though Georgie Washington is the leader, each book will focus on a different president and in some way, incorporate something famous that president did while in office.There is absolutely no political motivation or any hidden messages.The Next 8 Books in the SeriesLittle Georgie Washington & his Presidential pals: In the first book we are introduced to little Georgie Washington who is essentially the leader of the gang. When an unfriendly cat appears on the white house lawn, Georgie try’s his best to befriend him but the kitten makes it clear he just wants to be left alone. This leads to a large chase that eventually lands the cat in the top of a tree. Unable to jump down himself, Georgie enlists the help of his presidential pals to help rescue him, only to find out the cat is still unappreciative. Little Donnie Trump & his Presidential Pals: In the second book we are introduced to the newest member of the Prez-Pals. Little, mischievous Donnie Trump. When Georgie suggests a day out to an amusement park to welcome the newest member of the gang, the presidents jump for joy but when they arrive they are surprised to find out that little Donnie has purposely jammed the “yuge” rollercoaster with the gang all on board so that he may have the park all to himself- but he soon comes to his senses when little Franky Roosevelt teaches him that rides can be more fun when we all ride them together.Little Georgie Bush & his Presidential Pals: In the third installment, the White House is visited by friendly aliens but when little Georgie W. engages the alien visitors in an epic food fight, little Jonny Kennedy must step in and teach W to respect our Alien friends and what it means to ‘play nice’. Little Barry Obama & his Presidential Pals: When a giant heard of elephants escapes from the local wildlife park, Barry Obama springs to the rescue.

<p><strong>THE STORY BEHIND <i>THE TRUTH ABOUT NEW YORK</i></strong></p>
<p>Telling the real story of New York — offering an account that’s more inclusive, accurate, and accessible than what you usually find in typical travel guides or academic cultural studies — has never been more important than it is today.  New York, which continues to help shape and define culture the world over, has always been a deeply influential player on the world stage, most notably in the arts and entertainment industries.  Right now, tolerance and multiculturalism is under serious attack in America and around the globe; yet New York remains a powerful beacon for the broad scope of the human experience.  So it's no wonder then that millions of people gravitate to New York.</p>
<p>But New York is a very complex city.  While it is certainly a place full opportunity and excitement, it is also a place that can be quite unforgiving, especially to those who are unfamiliar to its unique flow and character.  This is why before you move to New York, you should know what you’re <i>really</i> getting into.  And if you’re already living in New York, but haven’t quite figured things out yet or would like to expand your understanding of this town, then there are a number of things you need to know if you plan on extending your stay or if you simply want to maximize the time that you still have left here.</p>
<p>Typical travel guides won’t help you in this regard; their focus is restricted to “what to do” lists, fun-time activities, etc. People who want to live or spend significant time in New York need something deeper, a guide that explores the real New York in candid terms. Enter <i>The Truth About New York</i>.  </p>
<p><i>The Truth About New York </i>aims to enlighten those who haven’t been to New York, just as much as it seeks to broaden the understanding of veteran New Yorkers.  And because the <i>vacation-get-away</i> version of New York will always be a fantastic endeavor, <i>The Truth About New York </i>also serves as a great supplement to conventional travel guides.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT MAKES THIS BOOK SO AMAZING?</strong></p>
<p>A few things: </p>
<p><strong>IF YOU LOVE TO LEARN ABOUT THINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE:</strong></p>
<p>YOU’RE GOING TO LOVE THE NATURE OF THIS BOOK.  New York is open and liberal by nature, but this narrative contains many twists and turns.  <i>The Truth About New York </i>includes hard truths about socio-economics, work, race, ethnicity, housing, gender, the arts, friendship, dating, sex, the New York mentality, and more.  No topic is taboo, no punches are held, and everything is covered straight up, no chaser.  And <i>The Truth About New York</i> is far more inclusive and culturally informative than any other book you’ll ever read about life in contemporary New York.</p>
<p><strong>IF YOU LOVE NEW YORK:</strong></p>
<ul><li>YOU’RE GONNA LOVE NEW YORK EVEN MORE.  If you’ve ever wondered what makes New York tick; why there’s so much vibrant energy here; how there’s more than <i>800</i> languages spoken here and why we still understand each other; why you can come to New York with nothing and still make it; you will completely understand after you read <i>The Truth About New York</i>.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IF YOU HATE NEW YORK:</strong></p>
<ul><li>YOU WON'T HATE NEW YORK ANYMORE. Honest!  But you might be more terrified of New York than ever before.  Or you may be inspired to pick up everything you own and move to New York on a whim.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IF YOU WANT ALL THE BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT NEW YORK FINALLY ANSWERED:</strong></p>
<p>ALL OF YOUR BIG QUESTIONS WILL FINALLY BE ANSWERED, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“What’s the deal with New Yorkers?” (<i>We think we’re the best… Read the book!</i>)</li>
<li>“Where can I find a nice, spacious, affordable apartment in New York?” (<i>There’s no such thing in New York… Read the book!)</i>
</li>
<li>“Is Brooklyn really the way it’s portrayed in the television show 'Girls'? (<i>No! But in North Brooklyn, it’s, well, complicated… Read the book.</i>)</li>
<li>“What’s dating like in New York?” (<i>It’s absolutely insane… Read the book!</i>)</li>
<li>“How do New Yorkers have so much free time to do so much?” (What?! <i>Nobody has free time in this town… Read the book!</i>)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IF YOU LIKE GOOD WRITING:</strong></p>
<p>THIS BOOK IS EXTRA EXCELLENT LITERATURE.  Honest!  It will challenge you.  It will make you laugh.  It will make you cry.  It will make you think.  It will shatter your notions of New York.  It will bolster your notions of New York.  It will enlighten you.  It will entertain you.  It will equip you with the sort of knowledge and banter material that will make you the star attraction at any rooftop party, cocktail party, backyard party, post-symposium meet-and-greet, or dive-bar date.  And it’s all very accessible, no tricky dance moves required.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT'S THE MONEY GOING TOWARDS? </strong></p>
<p><strong>PRODUCTION, PRINTNG, MARKETING, PODCAST, AND FILM.</strong></p>
<p><i>The Truth About New York</i> was published by my company, Superchamp Books, and made available in limited quantities almost a year ago.  I made this move as a business decision to break deeper into a publishing market that now makes it more possible for independent publishers to compete.  </p>
<p>I was astonished when I learned that the <i>Village Voice</i> had selected <i>The Truth About New York</i> as one of its 2016 “<i>Village Voice</i> Gift Guide” books and dubbed it the ""ultimate New York City guide;” and I was equally encouraged when Emily J. Smith (<i>Salon</i>) reviewed <i>The Truth About New York</i> and called it a “must read” that is “remarkably useful and deeply relatable.” </p>
<p>From the start, my objective has been to make <i>The Truth About New York</i> a household name.  Given the recent buzz, I’m now poised to make this a reality.  But in order to do this as an independent publisher, I need to raise the level of money that will help expand upon the buzz that has only just begun. This means re-publishing (expansion of production and printing), implementing sustainable marketing, and creating multi-lingual versions of the book.</p>
<p>If we reach our goal for the book, I'll be able to publish and print new hardcover and paperback versions of the book, develop Spanish, French, and German language versions, and produce a new eBook version in English, Spanish, French, and German.  In addition, money will be used to retain a publicist and take full advantage of Penguin Random House’s Publishers Services program for independent publishers.</p>
<p>Finally, I will be able to launch and produce the first 12 episodes of “The Truth About New York” podcast; and I will be able to produce and co-direct <i>The Truth About New York  </i>film.  Thus, money will go to pay for editors, contributing writers, translators, designers, formatting, printing, shipping, a show producer, podcast hosts, a podcast editor, a podcast writer, a fact checker, an engineer, a director of photography, a sound person, an archival specialist, and studio rental fees.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT “THE TRUTH ABOUT NEW YORK” PODCAST</strong></p>
<p>With writing leadership and structural guidance from writer and campaign team member Darley Stewart, and media advice and guidance from Jamie Claar, Acquisitions Editor, Superchamp Books, I will launch “The Truth About New York” podcast.  This hour-long, weekly podcast will be based around the structure of the book and it will expand on many of the topical areas covered in the book, like culture, race, art, dating, sex, nightlife, gender, politics, and more. Each episode of ""The Truth About New York,"" which will be co-written by Darley, will feature at least one New Yorker of note as well as one everyday New Yorker and some of the interviewees I spoke with during my research for the book.  </p>
<p><strong>ABOUT “THE TRUTH ABOUT NEW YORK” FILM</strong></p>
<p>To be directed by Amir Ali Said (my son) and me, this documentary will draw from the book, touching on many of the topical areas covered, but it will offer the sort of visual narrative that only a film can provide.  The film will feature interviews and commentary from New Yorkers of note, including members of New York arts institutions and organizations and leading industries, as well as a variety of everyday New Yorkers and a number of the people that I interviewed during my research for the book.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS INDIEGOGO AND HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></p>
<p>Indiegogo is a conduit for creatives to bridge the gap between imagination and implementation. The platform gives artists, innovators, and entrepreneurs like me the opportunity to reach audiences directly for funding creative projects.  I'm using Indiegogo because it allows me to go directly to you and humbly ask for your support.  I hope that the success of my project serves as inspiration for others.  At the same time, I want my project to be a leading example of the evolving dynamic of publishing, as it demonstrates how anyone with a great idea, regardless of socio-economic background, race, or gender, can produce it and bring it to market. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY SHOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE?</strong></p>
<p>In short, because you care; because you value the arts and culture, and you understand what it takes.  Furthermore, this project will create <i>at least</i> 20 new solid freelance jobs for a variety of people within the at-large creative community in New York, across America, and around the globe. When creatives stick together, we all rise!  Projects like this one provide work that allow fellow creatives to continue their mission of contributing to culture and speaking truth to power.   </p>

Telling the real story of New York — offering an account that’s more inclusive, accurate, and accessible than what you usually find in typical travel guides or academic cultural studies — has never been more important than it is today.  New York, which continues to help shape and define culture the world over, has always been a deeply influential player on the world stage, most notably in the arts and entertainment industries.  Right now, tolerance and multiculturalism is under serious attack in America and around the globe; yet New York remains a powerful beacon for the broad scope of the human experience.  So it's no wonder then that millions of people gravitate to New York.
But New York is a very complex city.  While it is certainly a place full opportunity and excitement, it is also a place that can be quite unforgiving, especially to those who are unfamiliar to its unique flow and character.  This is why before you move to New York, you should know what you’re really getting into.  And if you’re already living in New York, but haven’t quite figured things out yet or would like to expand your understanding of this town, then there are a number of things you need to know if you plan on extending your stay or if you simply want to maximize the time that you still have left here.
Typical travel guides won’t help you in this regard; their focus is restricted to “what to do” lists, fun-time activities, etc. People who want to live or spend significant time in New York need something deeper, a guide that explores the real New York in candid terms. Enter The Truth About New York.  
The Truth About New York aims to enlighten those who haven’t been to New York, just as much as it seeks to broaden the understanding of veteran New Yorkers.  And because the vacation-get-away version of New York will always be a fantastic endeavor, The Truth About New York also serves as a great supplement to conventional travel guides.
 
WHAT MAKES THIS BOOK SO AMAZING?
A few things: 
IF YOU LOVE TO LEARN ABOUT THINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE:
YOU’RE GOING TO LOVE THE NATURE OF THIS BOOK.  New York is open and liberal by nature, but this narrative contains many twists and turns.  The Truth About New York includes hard truths about socio-economics, work, race, ethnicity, housing, gender, the arts, friendship, dating, sex, the New York mentality, and more.  No topic is taboo, no punches are held, and everything is covered straight up, no chaser.  And The Truth About New York is far more inclusive and culturally informative than any other book you’ll ever read about life in contemporary New York.
IF YOU LOVE NEW YORK:
YOU’RE GONNA LOVE NEW YORK EVEN MORE.  If you’ve ever wondered what makes New York tick; why there’s so much vibrant energy here; how there’s more than 800 languages spoken here and why we still understand each other; why you can come to New York with nothing and still make it; you will completely understand after you read The Truth About New York.
 
IF YOU HATE NEW YORK:
YOU WON'T HATE NEW YORK ANYMORE. Honest!  But you might be more terrified of New York than ever before.  Or you may be inspired to pick up everything you own and move to New York on a whim.
 
IF YOU WANT ALL THE BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT NEW YORK FINALLY ANSWERED:
ALL OF YOUR BIG QUESTIONS WILL FINALLY BE ANSWERED, like:

“What’s the deal with New Yorkers?” (We think we’re the best… Read the book!)
“Where can I find a nice, spacious, affordable apartment in New York?” (There’s no such thing in New York… Read the book!)

“Is Brooklyn really the way it’s portrayed in the television show 'Girls'? (No! But in North Brooklyn, it’s, well, complicated… Read the book.)
“What’s dating like in New York?” (It’s absolutely insane… Read the book!)
“How do New Yorkers have so much free time to do so much?” (What?! Nobody has free time in this town… Read the book!)

 
IF YOU LIKE GOOD WRITING:
THIS BOOK IS EXTRA EXCELLENT LITERATURE.  Honest!  It will challenge you.  It will make you laugh.  It will make you cry.  It will make you think.  It will shatter your notions of New York.  It will bolster your notions of New York.  It will enlighten you.  It will entertain you.  It will equip you with the sort of knowledge and banter material that will make you the star attraction at any rooftop party, cocktail party, backyard party, post-symposium meet-and-greet, or dive-bar date.  And it’s all very accessible, no tricky dance moves required.

WHAT'S THE MONEY GOING TOWARDS? 
PRODUCTION, PRINTNG, MARKETING, PODCAST, AND FILM.
The Truth About New York was published by my company, Superchamp Books, and made available in limited quantities almost a year ago.  I made this move as a business decision to break deeper into a publishing market that now makes it more possible for independent publishers to compete.  
I was astonished when I learned that the Village Voice had selected The Truth About New York as one of its 2016 “Village Voice Gift Guide” books and dubbed it the ""ultimate New York City guide;” and I was equally encouraged when Emily J. Smith (Salon) reviewed The Truth About New York and called it a “must read” that is “remarkably useful and deeply relatable.” 
From the start, my objective has been to make The Truth About New York a household name.  Given the recent buzz, I’m now poised to make this a reality.  But in order to do this as an independent publisher, I need to raise the level of money that will help expand upon the buzz that has only just begun. This means re-publishing (expansion of production and printing), implementing sustainable marketing, and creating multi-lingual versions of the book.
If we reach our goal for the book, I'll be able to publish and print new hardcover and paperback versions of the book, develop Spanish, French, and German language versions, and produce a new eBook version in English, Spanish, French, and German.  In addition, money will be used to retain a publicist and take full advantage of Penguin Random House’s Publishers Services program for independent publishers.
Finally, I will be able to launch and produce the first 12 episodes of “The Truth About New York” podcast; and I will be able to produce and co-direct The Truth About New York  film.  Thus, money will go to pay for editors, contributing writers, translators, designers, formatting, printing, shipping, a show producer, podcast hosts, a podcast editor, a podcast writer, a fact checker, an engineer, a director of photography, a sound person, an archival specialist, and studio rental fees.
ABOUT “THE TRUTH ABOUT NEW YORK” PODCAST
With writing leadership and structural guidance from writer and campaign team member Darley Stewart, and media advice and guidance from Jamie Claar, Acquisitions Editor, Superchamp Books, I will launch “The Truth About New York” podcast.  This hour-long, weekly podcast will be based around the structure of the book and it will expand on many of the topical areas covered in the book, like culture, race, art, dating, sex, nightlife, gender, politics, and more. Each episode of ""The Truth About New York,"" which will be co-written by Darley, will feature at least one New Yorker of note as well as one everyday New Yorker and some of the interviewees I spoke with during my research for the book.  
ABOUT “THE TRUTH ABOUT NEW YORK” FILM
To be directed by Amir Ali Said (my son) and me, this documentary will draw from the book, touching on many of the topical areas covered, but it will offer the sort of visual narrative that only a film can provide.  The film will feature interviews and commentary from New Yorkers of note, including members of New York arts institutions and organizations and leading industries, as well as a variety of everyday New Yorkers and a number of the people that I interviewed during my research for the book.  
 
WHAT IS INDIEGOGO AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
Indiegogo is a conduit for creatives to bridge the gap between imagination and implementation. The platform gives artists, innovators, and entrepreneurs like me the opportunity to reach audiences directly for funding creative projects.  I'm using Indiegogo because it allows me to go directly to you and humbly ask for your support.  I hope that the success of my project serves as inspiration for others.  At the same time, I want my project to be a leading example of the evolving dynamic of publishing, as it demonstrates how anyone with a great idea, regardless of socio-economic background, race, or gender, can produce it and bring it to market. 
 
WHY SHOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE?
In short, because you care; because you value the arts and culture, and you understand what it takes.  Furthermore, this project will create at least 20 new solid freelance jobs for a variety of people within the at-large creative community in New York, across America, and around the globe. When creatives stick together, we all rise!  Projects like this one provide work that allow fellow creatives to continue their mission of contributing to culture and speaking truth to power.

<h3>In Short </h3>
<p><strong>The Faroe Islands</strong> is a small nation located in the North Atlantic, between Scotland and Iceland. With its small population and largely pristine nature the islands have long been a hidden gem of Northern Europe. There are two traditionally important trades in the Faroe islands, <strong>fishing and sheep herding</strong>, which still play an important role in the Faroese society and economy today. Just like all over the globe these livelihoods are subject to major disruptions due to concerns over <strong>climate change and sustainability</strong>. The Faroe Islands Project aims to cover the effect these changes are having on the people and communities behind these <strong>traditional ways of life</strong>. </p>
<p>The Faroe Islands is largely in the mercy of the forces of nature due to its location which will provide subtle tell tale signs of future environmental impacts.The project will look into the <strong>delicate natural microcosm</strong> of the Faroe Islands and the <strong>unique relationship</strong> the Faroese have with the environment to try to understand the <strong>effects climate change</strong> will have on our everyday lives. The Faroe Islands, where these traditional livelihoods still form a core part of the community, will also give us clues as to what the future of a more <strong>sustainable and natural</strong> food production might look like.</p>
<p>I plan to stay in the Faroe Islands for <strong>three weeks</strong>, spending time with people within both the sheep herding and fishing communities. I will be gathering material in a variety of mediums for the final piece which will consist of a multimedia online experience and a print object. These two elements will form a whole and both will contain material specifically designed for the outlet, embracing the <strong>native forms of both online and print journalism</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why it matters</h3>
<p>The project will aim to gain insight in to consequences of <strong>large scale environmental changes</strong> disrupting <strong>traditional lifestyles</strong> and how it affects the <strong>people and communities</strong> involved. Climate change is one of the greatest global threats today and the need for sustainability has already affected our everyday lives in major ways.</p>
<p>The complex issues of our food production and consumption are often reported on a more global level, focusing on the <strong>large scale</strong>. That is why I want to discover the human stories of the people who are directly affected by the uncertainty of these traditional livelihoods, shifting the focus to the <strong>smaller scale</strong>. </p>
<p>As our news cycles grow shorter and growingly focused on breaking news <strong>Slow Journalism</strong> projects like the Faroe Islands Project are increasingly important because they provide a <strong>deeper understanding</strong> of the issues and allow journalists to take the time to record<strong> genuine human stories</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The reason we're here - I need your help!</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Traveling to the remote corners of the world is never easy - nor cheap! Though the Faroese capital, Torshavn, is reachable by plane only two airlines fly the route, driving ticket prices up for us adventurous souls. There are currently only two hostels in the Faroe Islands and to get around between the islands I will have to use both the local ferry and helicopter services. On top of this I will need weatherproof gear to protect myself and my camera from the unpredictable Faroese nature. I quickly realised all these expenses were piling up, which is why I started this campaign. Now you get a chance to support young, longform journalism!</p>
<p> Below you can find a breakdown of my budget for the whole three weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flights: 700€</li>
<li>Accommodation in a hostel: 650€</li>
<li>Local transportation: 350€</li>
<li>Daily food/necessities budget 28€/day: 600€</li>
<li>Equipment (weatherproof shoes, jacket, trousers, and backpack): 450€</li>

<p>Organizing a Writer's Residence Space in Tbilisi, Georgia<br/><br/>Betania Writer’s Residence is a space project organized by the international autonomous collective to support intellectual labor of individuals and teams by providing a research residence and co-working space on any stage of their work in the quiet and peaceful mountainous village outside Tbilisi, Georgia.<br/><br/> <br/>Our main goal is to establish an open, innovative and cooperative international space platform for various practices of intellectual work, be it literary or scientific, and enable networked reflections and research about interconnected local and global challenges we face in the world today.<br/><br/>The Writer's Residence will provide interested individuals and teams identifying themselves with our goals to apply and reserve some spots on our residence space throughout the year,  for a time live and work in the surroundings, and invite their desired colleagues from elsewhere for mutually elaborating individual or collaborative project initiatives. In that way, we think of the Betania scene, as a birth-place of various new initiatives that can later find their shape in Georgian or other contexts and translate into wider societal projects.<br/><br/>Visiting residents will not be limited to certain topics or disciplinary boundaries. In the best scenario, projects hosted by the space, would tackle wide range of contemporary challenges we face in our societies today, and could later be translated into a societal project and get public outreach.<br/><br/>We particularly seek to support projects that bring to the fore the salient issues that are currently problematic to the region and particularity to Georgia, but we do not limit our scope with the local focus only. We want to engage in the global dialogue that goes far beyond the local peculiarities and contribute, as well as learn from that. For that, we are open to hosting individuals or teams dealing with topics and issues characteristic to any part of the world and plan to link and grow our diverse and extended network members from all over the world, exchange our views and develop common projects through available resources. We are particularly eager to create an international co-working space with literature resources for projects that could possibly benefit from the geographical location of Georgia, work-friendly atmosphere in nature and our library infrastructure. <br/><br/>Our team is an international autonomous collective of around 15 individuals with an experience of working in international academic or artistic institutions. We have met each other in different, academic, artistic or personally created settings of Berlin, Budapest, Tbilisi, Telavi, Bucharest, or Betania, and through cycles of critical discussions about current state of global educational and research affairs, developed a network of like-minds who are willing to put an effort in developing the experimental residential working space and building up a network. <strong>The project of this kind to our knowledge does not have an analog regionally and even internationally. </strong><br/><br/>Through this crowdfunding, we want to arrange basic water and accommodating infrastructure and become available to offer short-term (2-4 weeks) residence for our writers in residence.<br/><br/>Project Spot:  Our space is a three-floor residential house located in the beautiful green and calm nature setting of Betania area - 25 km. above the central Tbilisi district, in between mountains, overlooking the expansive view of the city.

<h3><i><strong>Having been vegan for 27 years now, I am excited by the evolution taking place all over the world. I am thrilled to be a part of making this transition easier for people.</strong></i></h3>
<p>My husband and I have been running a vegan catering company for the last 15 years and the feedback we've gotten the most, is that people feel good eating a plant based diet and would live this way if only they could eat the food we cook, everyday! Many people just don't know how to make healthy food tasty...</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Where do the crowd funds go?</h3>
<p>Since PASSION came out I've spent the last 3 years creating new recipes (and some old favourites) and styling and shooting them. I've paid for a professional editor, proof reader and graphic designer (approximately $10,000). The book has gone to print and I've paid $15,000 deposit to set the printing in motion.</p>
<p>So aside from the $25,000 we've spent we need the following: In order to collect the books from the Brisbane docks, I need the remaining $24,190 for the production costs, the 10% Government import GST tax ($4,081), the Port Services fees ($5,000) and transport costs to move 16 pallets of books to my storage unit here in Mullumbimby!</p>
<p><strong>Summary of costs</strong></p>
<p>$24,190 books</p>
<p>$4,081 Govt. tax</p>
<p>$5,000 Port services</p>
<p>$1,600 Transport costs</p>
<p>$3,600 Indiegogo platform fees,</p>
<p>$1,500 Paypal fees &amp; cushion</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>$40,000 total</p>
<h3><strong>If I raise more than I'm asking for?</strong></h3>
<p>If my campaign goes over my asking amount, it will help cover the costs for the VIP Byron Bay launch party ($5,000) and postage costs within the campaign (approximately $4,051). If my campaign doesn't go over then I will obviously be covering these...</p>
<p>So my hope is that if people simply purchase a copy of HUNGRY for themselves, and others as gifts for their friends and family, this will help cover my costs...</p>

<h3>Bringing The Legacy to the World!</h3>
<p><i><strong>I’m Stasia Morineaux—writer, creator, and ethereal-dreamer.</strong></i> I’ve spent the last several years working on Nine While Nine creating a host of characters, a new mythology, a winding twisting tale, and a world for you to get lost within.</p>
<p>The book—part one in a series—has been perfected with the diligent efforts of a team of highly skilled editors at Parliament House Publishing. But now it’s my turn to take the reins and launch an intensive, worldwide marketing and media blitz!</p>
<p><strong>The publishing game just isn’t what it used to be.</strong></p>
<p>Most book marketing these days falls on the author’s shoulders, even in big publishing companies. Marketing momentum by creating buzz needs to be gained before books are even released.   (Author John Green was able to achieve <strong>bestseller status</strong> for his book “The Fault In Our Stars” before it was even published!) </p>
<p>I’ve got all my social media platforms well-covered, but now it’s time to stretch beyond that and dive into print ads, and touring as well.</p>
<p>In this age of publishing, readers want to connect with the author on a more personal level, and the best way to achieve this is with conventions, signings, and various book events.</p>
<p>I need your help with achieving these new goals in making a monumental impact with my proposed worldwide media blitz.</p>

I’m Stasia Morineaux—writer, creator, and ethereal-dreamer. I’ve spent the last several years working on Nine While Nine creating a host of characters, a new mythology, a winding twisting tale, and a world for you to get lost within.
The book—part one in a series—has been perfected with the diligent efforts of a team of highly skilled editors at Parliament House Publishing. But now it’s my turn to take the reins and launch an intensive, worldwide marketing and media blitz!
The publishing game just isn’t what it used to be.
Most book marketing these days falls on the author’s shoulders, even in big publishing companies. Marketing momentum by creating buzz needs to be gained before books are even released.   (Author John Green was able to achieve bestseller status for his book “The Fault In Our Stars” before it was even published!) 
I’ve got all my social media platforms well-covered, but now it’s time to stretch beyond that and dive into print ads, and touring as well.
In this age of publishing, readers want to connect with the author on a more personal level, and the best way to achieve this is with conventions, signings, and various book events.
I need your help with achieving these new goals in making a monumental impact with my proposed worldwide media blitz.
My strategy includes print ads in the highly acclaimed Faerie Magazine, an international publication with a demographic set that is perfect for my brand and is highly visible across all social media platforms.


The blitz will also include attending Book Conventions, Signings, Author Events, and Festivals.

<p>My name is Alan Farber, I am 49 years old, single, and work as a general laborer in an electronics manufacturer in Indiana, from which I am on temporary layoff. I have also driven eighteen-wheelers in 47 states, managed restaurants, been an FM radio country DJ, and a golden-oldies AM radio DJ.</p>
<p>One thing that has followed me all my life is my love of reading, and a desire to write. I have been working on a story for many years now, and have finally reached the point where it is ready for publication. I have researched the needed steps many times, and am fully aware of the actions I need to perform to publish on my own, as well as the costs. Now all I need is your help to get my story to the masses.</p>
<p>Why publish on my own, and not submit the book to Tor, or another fantasy publisher? Firstly, so that I know it will be printed. Many submissions, no matter how good, are not printed because they may conflict with one already being published, or because the editor who was given the book to review it didn't like it. Secondly, to retain control of the work, of course. Once you sell your first book to a publisher, they will take over all the aspects of it: editing, formatting, and cover. They will cut out anything they think is not pertinent to the plot to save printing costs. They can revise it into something that hardly resembles my original.  They will put it out in what size they want, not what I'd like - it could end up as a cheap 6"" x 9"" floppy-cover with a cartoon on the cover. And in the end, I'll earn only what they paid me when I sold it to them.<br/></p>
<p><b>""The Chronicles of Caylor""</b> is a five-book series of fantasy/fiction, loosely based on a long-running adventure of my friends through a Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign created by myself. It concerns four adventurers who come together, not knowing each other, and begin their careers. <br/></p>
<p>The series is entitled ""The Chronicles of Caylor."" There are five books: ""The Thule Tower,"" ""The Seethia Tower,"" ""The Malvera Tower,"" ""The Hastur Tower,"" and ""The Celestial Tower.""</p>
<p>The first book is now complete, and needs editing, proofing, a cover, promoted, and published. It is 82,226 words, which is approximately 270 pages in trade-paperback size.</p>
<br/><p><b>The story</b> - Four adventurers are hired by the Guild to investigate the death of several workers in the Stillmire Swamp: Morganna, a female mage with a strong will and a short temper, and a disregard for good, evil, or any kind of balance between the two, and who finds rules a hindrance; Giovanna, a female ranger, shy and quiet, with a deep regard for nature and balance, and a fear of risk;  Lance, a male cleric of Thor, with a natural tendency toward good and lawfulness, as well as leadership; and Frizzle, a male gnome illusionist and thief, who seems to embody chaos and risk. <br/></p>
<p>Once the four companions discover and eliminate the foul creature that killed the workers, they discover a mist-enshrouded tower deep in the swamp. Investigating the tower, they find themselves fighting the animated remains of animals and men, before even entering the lone tower, and nearly end their adventures there. After asking for help from their mentors and trainers, they return to the tower, and defeat the recently risen undead. The object that had caused the undead to rise is forgotten, though, once they enter the tower and discover its peculiarities and mysteries; such as the ground floor has no stairs leading upward, yet from the outside they can see there is a window far above. Before long, they discover the secret to reaching the second floor, which holds yet another puzzle. Finally gaining the top floor, finding more mysteries and dangers along the way, they find the strangest mystery of all: four mirrors, each showing a different land and season. Stepping through the mirrors takes them to towers of identical design, but differing in furnishings and location, and each with their own risks and dangers. They again require the help of their superiors. After much study, their mentors announce that there is yet more to be learned about the towers, and that they are on the verge of an incredible discovery. The mentors return to the city for further research - but end up dying under very mysterious circumstances. Now, the four adventurers are left on their own to explore the remaining towers.</p>
<p>The reader will find hints that the adventurers are still not working alone, and are not only being closely watched, but secretly aided and hindered as well. In this first book, only vague hints are given, and the adventurers remain completely ignorant. In the first book, nothing is revealed about who the mysterious person(s) is, or why they are watching, and sometimes interfering with the group. Each book will reveal a small amount of information about this person(s), and the members of the group begin to suspect, but only in the fifth book will the truth be revealed, and the adventurers know.<br/></p>
<p>Each of the novels follows the adventurers as they explore one of the towers and its surrounding areas, complete with strange and unique  peoples, cities, creatures, and dangers. After exploring the four towers, they discover there is a fifth tower, with a magical ability they scarcely believe, and located in a place that cannot possibly be. And only then will they discover that they have been watched, aided, and hindered, by the unknown entity from the very beginning. It is then that they discover that the forgotten object from the beginning of their adventures holds 
the key to victory, and the safety of their entire world. Now, if Frizzle could only remember where he sold it...<br/></p>
<p>The novels follow the adventurers as they grow closer, wiser, and stronger. Each character is developed along the way, revealing their backgrounds, and their feelings for each other as they change. There is a bit of romance, a bit of rivalry, and a lot of action, as four very different personas learn to work together to survive.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Your donations will be used to perform the following tasks on ""The Chronicles of Caylor: Book One - The Thule Tower"":</p> <ul>
<li>Proofing and editing.<br/>
</li>
<li> Formatting and creation of the EPUB and Kindle editions.</li>
<li>Formatting and printing of the first run of the print edition.</li>
<li>Promotion and advertising to retailers and online outlets for all versions - EPUB, Kindle, and print.</li>
<li>Aside from the possible Perks, when you donate any amount, you will receive your choice of the final book in one of the following formats: EPUB, Mobi/Kindle, PDF, or Word document. (You must request the book after donating, tell me which format you prefer, and an email where it can be sent. If you are willing to pay the shipping, I will send you a print copy when they are available.)<br/>
</li>
</ul> <p>The costs your donation will cover are as follows:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Editing costs range from $.02 to $.10 per word, depending on the quality of the editor. At $.05 per word at 82,226 words, that comes to just over $4,000, though most editors will charge a smaller sum for complete works already fee of basic mistakes, which this book is. If the amount raised allows for the best, that is what I will get. Otherwise, I will have it done for less by less competent and less known editors.</li>
<li>The formatting and creation of the EPUB and Kindle versions can be done for less than $300 for both. </li>
<li>The formatting of the print version varies, but is generally between $200 and $1,000. Going by the size of my book and the ready condition of the text, it should be less than $500.<br/>
</li> <li>The printing costs of the physical print books can vary quite widely. On-Demand publishers can be very cheap, but produce very cheap products. Exactly what printing option is used will depend on how much is raised, and will vary from simple formatting for a few initial books printed for around $1,000, to polished and professional work on one thousand books for around $4,000.</li>
<li>Advertising and promotional costs also vary considerably. They can run from simple e-flyers sent to a few online stores and physical retailers for a few hundred dollars, to full-color promotional leaflets mailed to most online booksellers and retailers running into the thousands of dollars. I will use the funds left over from the previous steps to get the very best exposure possible.<br/>
</li>
<li>At all stages, I will not spend the entirety of the donations, and leave the book in limbo. If only enough is raised to do the most basic and inexpensive work in each stage, that is what will be done. If, on the other hand, donations are enough, only the best will be contracted.</li>
<li>If funding is less than $4,000, likely only the ebook versions will be published, promoted for now, though a print version will be print-ready, and sales of the ebooks will fund the printing and promotion of the print version.</li>
<li>If funding is less than $2,000 the ebooks will be edited, published, and promoted, and sales of the ebooks (hopefully) pay for the print version to be set-up, promoted, and printed.<br/>
</li>
</ul> </div> <br/> <div> <h3>Bonuses</h3>There are several bonuses to funding my project:
<ul>
<li>The first book is already finished, you will be funding a completed book, not waiting for one to (hopefully) be written.</li>
<li>A preview of the book is available, so you can see what the style and quality is before you donate: <a href=""https://payhip.com/chroniclesofcaylor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Preview</a>
</li>
<li>I have already copyrighted and obtained an ISBN for the first book.</li>
<li>I have already obtained the cover artwork.<br/>
</li>
<li>I have already purchased the domain name <a href=""http://chroniclesofcaylor.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>chroniclesofcaylor.com</a>, obtained hosting, and set up a web page for the release of the book. I have also pre-ordered the domain name chroniclesofcaylor.book.<br/>

</div></div>","The Chronicles of Caylor
My name is Alan Farber, I am 49 years old, single, and work as a general laborer in an electronics manufacturer in Indiana, from which I am on temporary layoff. I have also driven eighteen-wheelers in 47 states, managed restaurants, been an FM radio country DJ, and a golden-oldies AM radio DJ.
One thing that has followed me all my life is my love of reading, and a desire to write. I have been working on a story for many years now, and have finally reached the point where it is ready for publication. I have researched the needed steps many times, and am fully aware of the actions I need to perform to publish on my own, as well as the costs. Now all I need is your help to get my story to the masses.
Why publish on my own, and not submit the book to Tor, or another fantasy publisher? Firstly, so that I know it will be printed. Many submissions, no matter how good, are not printed because they may conflict with one already being published, or because the editor who was given the book to review it didn't like it. Secondly, to retain control of the work, of course. Once you sell your first book to a publisher, they will take over all the aspects of it: editing, formatting, and cover. They will cut out anything they think is not pertinent to the plot to save printing costs. They can revise it into something that hardly resembles my original.  They will put it out in what size they want, not what I'd like - it could end up as a cheap 6"" x 9"" floppy-cover with a cartoon on the cover. And in the end, I'll earn only what they paid me when I sold it to them.
""The Chronicles of Caylor"" is a five-book series of fantasy/fiction, loosely based on a long-running adventure of my friends through a Dungeons & Dragons campaign created by myself. It concerns four adventurers who come together, not knowing each other, and begin their careers. 
The series is entitled ""The Chronicles of Caylor."" There are five books: ""The Thule Tower,"" ""The Seethia Tower,"" ""The Malvera Tower,"" ""The Hastur Tower,"" and ""The Celestial Tower.""
The first book is now complete, and needs editing, proofing, a cover, promoted, and published. It is 82,226 words, which is approximately 270 pages in trade-paperback size.
The story - Four adventurers are hired by the Guild to investigate the death of several workers in the Stillmire Swamp: Morganna, a female mage with a strong will and a short temper, and a disregard for good, evil, or any kind of balance between the two, and who finds rules a hindrance; Giovanna, a female ranger, shy and quiet, with a deep regard for nature and balance, and a fear of risk;  Lance, a male cleric of Thor, with a natural tendency toward good and lawfulness, as well as leadership; and Frizzle, a male gnome illusionist and thief, who seems to embody chaos and risk. 
Once the four companions discover and eliminate the foul creature that killed the workers, they discover a mist-enshrouded tower deep in the swamp. Investigating the tower, they find themselves fighting the animated remains of animals and men, before even entering the lone tower, and nearly end their adventures there. After asking for help from their mentors and trainers, they return to the tower, and defeat the recently risen undead. The object that had caused the undead to rise is forgotten, though, once they enter the tower and discover its peculiarities and mysteries; such as the ground floor has no stairs leading upward, yet from the outside they can see there is a window far above. Before long, they discover the secret to reaching the second floor, which holds yet another puzzle. Finally gaining the top floor, finding more mysteries and dangers along the way, they find the strangest mystery of all: four mirrors, each showing a different land and season. Stepping through the mirrors takes them to towers of identical design, but differing in furnishings and location, and each with their own risks and dangers. They again require the help of their superiors. After much study, their mentors announce that there is yet more to be learned about the towers, and that they are on the verge of an incredible discovery. The mentors return to the city for further research - but end up dying under very mysterious circumstances. Now, the four adventurers are left on their own to explore the remaining towers.
The reader will find hints that the adventurers are still not working alone, and are not only being closely watched, but secretly aided and hindered as well. In this first book, only vague hints are given, and the adventurers remain completely ignorant. In the first book, nothing is revealed about who the mysterious person(s) is, or why they are watching, and sometimes interfering with the group. Each book will reveal a small amount of information about this person(s), and the members of the group begin to suspect, but only in the fifth book will the truth be revealed, and the adventurers know.
Each of the novels follows the adventurers as they explore one of the towers and its surrounding areas, complete with strange and unique  peoples, cities, creatures, and dangers. After exploring the four towers, they discover there is a fifth tower, with a magical ability they scarcely believe, and located in a place that cannot possibly be. And only then will they discover that they have been watched, aided, and hindered, by the unknown entity from the very beginning. It is then that they discover that the forgotten object from the beginning of their adventures holds 
the key to victory, and the safety of their entire world. Now, if Frizzle could only remember where he sold it...
The novels follow the adventurers as they grow closer, wiser, and stronger. Each character is developed along the way, revealing their backgrounds, and their feelings for each other as they change. There is a bit of romance, a bit of rivalry, and a lot of action, as four very different personas learn to work together to survive.
   What I Need & What You Get Your donations will be used to perform the following tasks on ""The Chronicles of Caylor: Book One - The Thule Tower"": 
Proofing and editing.

 Formatting and creation of the EPUB and Kindle editions.
Formatting and printing of the first run of the print edition.
Promotion and advertising to retailers and online outlets for all versions - EPUB, Kindle, and print.
Aside from the possible Perks, when you donate any amount, you will receive your choice of the final book in one of the following formats: EPUB, Mobi/Kindle, PDF, or Word document. (You must request the book after donating, tell me which format you prefer, and an email where it can be sent. If you are willing to pay the shipping, I will send you a print copy when they are available.)

 The costs your donation will cover are as follows:  Editing costs range from $.02 to $.10 per word, depending on the quality of the editor. At $.05 per word at 82,226 words, that comes to just over $4,000, though most editors will charge a smaller sum for complete works already fee of basic mistakes, which this book is. If the amount raised allows for the best, that is what I will get. Otherwise, I will have it done for less by less competent and less known editors.
The formatting and creation of the EPUB and Kindle versions can be done for less than $300 for both. 
The formatting of the print version varies, but is generally between $200 and $1,000. Going by the size of my book and the ready condition of the text, it should be less than $500.
 The printing costs of the physical print books can vary quite widely. On-Demand publishers can be very cheap, but produce very cheap products. Exactly what printing option is used will depend on how much is raised, and will vary from simple formatting for a few initial books printed for around $1,000, to polished and professional work on one thousand books for around $4,000.
Advertising and promotional costs also vary considerably. They can run from simple e-flyers sent to a few online stores and physical retailers for a few hundred dollars, to full-color promotional leaflets mailed to most online booksellers and retailers running into the thousands of dollars. I will use the funds left over from the previous steps to get the very best exposure possible.

At all stages, I will not spend the entirety of the donations, and leave the book in limbo. If only enough is raised to do the most basic and inexpensive work in each stage, that is what will be done. If, on the other hand, donations are enough, only the best will be contracted.
If funding is less than $4,000, likely only the ebook versions will be published, promoted for now, though a print version will be print-ready, and sales of the ebooks will fund the printing and promotion of the print version.
If funding is less than $2,000 the ebooks will be edited, published, and promoted, and sales of the ebooks (hopefully) pay for the print version to be set-up, promoted, and printed.

    BonusesThere are several bonuses to funding my project:

The first book is already finished, you will be funding a completed book, not waiting for one to (hopefully) be written.
A preview of the book is available, so you can see what the style and quality is before you donate: Preview

I have already copyrighted and obtained an ISBN for the first book.
I have already obtained the cover artwork.

I have already purchased the domain name chroniclesofcaylor.com, obtained hosting, and set up a web page for the release of the book. I have also pre-ordered the domain name chroniclesofcaylor.book.

Your donation can be considered pre-ordering a book if you wish, and not just donating, as you can request a finished ebook version after donating. Just ask for one in the format of your choice: EPUB/EBOOK, Mobi/Kindle, or PDF, and when the version you requested is finalized I will send you a copy. (Please see the Perks section as well)

The second book is already written, though it is still undergoing final revision. The third through fifth books are already written in rough form, needing only to be revised to match changes in the previously finished books as they are completed.
As the book finishes each stage, I will update here with the expenses. You will know where the money is going.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Every single night it was the same question. It didn’t matter if he was playing with his toys, watching TV or whatever else he may have been doing – right around 9 pm he would ask me his question and he expected me to play his game. The exchange would go like this:</p><p>Seth: “Do you know what time it is?”</p><p>Me: “Time for you to get a job?”</p><p>Seth: “No.”</p><p>Me: “Time for you to clean your room?”</p><p>Seth: “Noooo!!!!!!!.”</p><p>And we would continue back and forth until I responded with the correct “Is it Snuggle Time?” Seth would then give a resounding “YES” and he would climb up on my lap, snuggle up against his daddy and stay that way until he fell asleep. This happened every night. Snuggle time was the highlight of my day and I believe it was Seth’s as well. Snuggle time in our home meant hugs, kisses, and unconditional love. Snuggle time completed another day for us and allowed Seth to give and receive love, have a sense of security, and get the attention of his daddy to end his day. Snuggle time was pure. Snuggle time was open and honest. Snuggle time completed us. It didn’t matter if I was reading, watching TV, browsing Facebook or anything else. When I heard “Do you know what time it is?” The world stopped so I could have snuggle time with my son.</p><p>Now I no longer will get to hear that question. Snuggle time with Seth has come to an end but at least I experienced it. Some people drink alcohol, do drugs, or find another way to experience a high. Snuggle time replaced any need for that. There was no better high than holding that child in your arms and receiving his little hugs and kisses and hearing “I love you daddy” to finish your day. So I ask all of you, “Do you know what time it is?” It’s a game that we all need to play more often. Maybe instead of having play station - if we replaced it with “Do you know what time it is?” the world would be a better place. Maybe children would grow up with less hate in their heart. Maybe there would be less violence. Maybe there would be more kindness. Maybe we all would feel a little more fulfilled. Through all of this pain I at least can rest assured that Seth knew he was loved and I knew that I was loved in return. Both of us knew the answer before the question was asked. In our world it was always snuggle time. Now ask yourself, “Do you know what time it is?”</p><p><strong>The Story Went Viral</strong></p><p>That story reached over 199,000 people through Seth's Facebook page as others shared it all over the nation and it became clear to me that despite my own personal pain I had a message that needed to be shared with the world.  Seth’s Snuggle Time story was a way that I could keep my son alive and maybe change some other lives in the process.  Maybe if other people heard Seth’s story they could re-examine their own relationships with their children.  Are they spending enough snuggle time with their kids?  Are they truly valuing the time they have with their children?  We all get so caught up in this fast-paced way of life that time passes us by and before we know it our kids are gone.  For most of us that means that they simply grew up, but for others that loss may have come too early.  Either way none of us get to keep our kids as toddlers forever.</p><p>So I began sharing Seth’s Snuggle Time story and I am happy to report that one thing led to another and after a two year journey “<strong>SJ the Monkey</strong>” was born!  SJ is the main character in our children’s book called ""Seth's Snuggle Time Game.""  The hope is that parents and children can read the book together, share the message of love and develop their own nightly ritual.</p><p><strong>SJ the Monkey</strong></p><p>Here is a picture of our main character in the book - ""SJ the Monkey"":</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431785888/h0ycaf57cifei0nvcnvm.png"" src="""" style=""width: 291.85px; height: 413px;""/></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Why Support This Project?  </strong></p><p></p><p>Every so often in life a message comes along that has the potential to make a huge impact and this children's picture book undoubtedly has the ability to do just that.  We strongly believe that SJ the Monkey can help change the world - one hug at a time.  However, we need you to join us in order to make ""Seth's Snuggle Time Game"" come alive.  <strong>Our goal is to make this into a Snuggle Time Movement that not only entertains but also educates</strong>. That's why the story in our children's book ends with SJ the Monkey telling the readers <strong>how</strong> to play his game!  He literally teaches kids (and parents) <strong>how</strong> to play the Snuggle Time game thus encouraging parents and kids to spend quality time together snuggling - the way it was meant to be!  Think about all of those kids out in the world who aren't getting their daily dose of attention from their parents.  What if we can change that?  What if we can open the eyes of those parents?  What if we could literally teach children how to get their parents to play the game?  How much better would our world be if there was more love and more Snuggle Time?  </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431788083/uzeqov56egsjlszmt5ca.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 494.05px; height: 320px;""/></p><p><strong>Where Does the Money Go?</strong></p><p>The $9,100 being asked for will cover Professional Services (illustrator, editing) and Trademarking costs and Publishing of First Edition Books.  These will be hardcover editions!  Everything we raise will go towards upgrading the books and/or getting more copies upfront as well as launching our website for this project.  </p><p><strong>Is the Book Professionally Illustrated?</strong></p><p>Yes!  We took our time and did this book right.  It was professionally illustrated and well written.  Professional editors have reviewed the book and we have worked with people who have many years of experience in this field.   This message is too important for us to take any short cuts - so we didn't!  It wasn't cheap, but with a message this important it had to be done right. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434146266/iisoyogu8slpwax76mve.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 247.5px; height: 202px;""/></p><p><strong>When will the Book go to Print?</strong></p><p>The story is 100% complete so once we meet our fundraising goal we will be sending the book out for the first round of printing.  Our current goal is to have first edition copies physically in hand ready to distribute this coming fall (before the holidays- fingers crossed) and EBook versions ready even sooner!  </p><p><strong>What Does the Future Hold for Us?</strong></p><p>SJ the Monkey is intended to spread his special message of Snuggle Time to everyone around the world and so if things go well we hope to launch the book in the USA and then put it into other languages and distribute it around the world!  We also hope that eventually a second SJ the Monkey book will be created.   We also have a goal of creating SJ the Monkey plushies, a phone app/game, music and much more. We will be launching our very own website in the coming months as well.  Our true goal is to get as many people as possible to join us and promote this message of love through the precious moments we call Snuggle Time.  <strong>What would the world be like if a million people were moved enough to begin their own nightly snuggle time ritual?</strong> The possibilities are limitless so join us today as we change the world through ""Seth's Snuggle Time Game"" - one hug at a time! </p><p>This campaign is just the start of our movement and we want to thank each and every one of you for taking the time to read through this and/or contribute and sponsor our campaign.  As we've said before we think Seth's Snuggle Time Game can change the world and with people like you helping us we will do exactly that - one hug at a time!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>","Campaign Over - Contact Us on FacebookThis campaign has ended but if you are interested in our story or trying to still get a book please go to ""In Memory of Seth James Maceyko"" on Facebook and you can contact us there.  Send us an email there and we will respond!  Check us out on the 10TV Columbus links below for video:For the video about how and why our message was born (as seen on 10TV):http://bit.ly/1MLjijn  (this link goes to 10TV.com for their copyrighted video)And to watch the video about the red cardinal (and the significance of the pretty bird):http://www.10tv.com/content/sections/video/index.html?video=/videos/2015/07/23/snuggle-time-story.xml What Exactly is Seth's Snuggle Time and Where Did It Come From?On March 20, 2013 my five year old son, Seth James Maceyko, died in an accident.  I remember how difficult it was to sleep those first several days and it was during one of those early mornings that I awoke with thoughts flooding my head about my child.  The images in my mind were so vivid and clear that it seemed as if I was re-living moments of my life all over again.  I went to Seth’s Facebook page (In Memory of Seth James Maceyko) and wrote the following:Seth’s Snuggle TimeEvery night Seth would ask me one question.

Now ask yourself, “Do you know what time it is?”The Story Went ViralThat story reached over 199,000 people through Seth's Facebook page as others shared it all over the nation and it became clear to me that despite my own personal pain I had a message that needed to be shared with the world.  Seth’s Snuggle Time story was a way that I could keep my son alive and maybe change some other lives in the process.  Maybe if other people heard Seth’s story they could re-examine their own relationships with their children.  Are they spending enough snuggle time with their kids?  Are they truly valuing the time they have with their children?  We all get so caught up in this fast-paced way of life that time passes us by and before we know it our kids are gone.  For most of us that means that they simply grew up, but for others that loss may have come too early.  Either way none of us get to keep our kids as toddlers forever.So I began sharing Seth’s Snuggle Time story and I am happy to report that one thing led to another and after a two year journey “SJ the Monkey” was born!  SJ is the main character in our children’s book called ""Seth's Snuggle Time Game.""  The hope is that parents and children can read the book together, share the message of love and develop their own nightly ritual.SJ the MonkeyHere is a picture of our main character in the book - ""SJ the Monkey"":Why Support This Project?  Every so often in life a message comes along that has the potential to make a huge impact and this children's picture book undoubtedly has the ability to do just that.  We strongly believe that SJ the Monkey can help change the world - one hug at a time.  However, we need you to join us in order to make ""Seth's Snuggle Time Game"" come alive.  Our goal is to make this into a Snuggle Time Movement that not only entertains but also educates. That's why the story in our children's book ends with SJ the Monkey telling the readers how to play his game!  He literally teaches kids (and parents) how to play the Snuggle Time game thus encouraging parents and kids to spend quality time together snuggling - the way it was meant to be!  Think about all of those kids out in the world who aren't getting their daily dose of attention from their parents.  What if we can change that?  What if we can open the eyes of those parents?  What if we could literally teach children how to get their parents to play the game?  How much better would our world be if there was more love and more Snuggle Time?  Where Does the Money Go?The $9,100 being asked for will cover Professional Services (illustrator, editing) and Trademarking costs and Publishing of First Edition Books.  These will be hardcover editions!  Everything we raise will go towards upgrading the books and/or getting more copies upfront as well as launching our website for this project.  Is the Book Professionally Illustrated?Yes!  We took our time and did this book right.  It was professionally illustrated and well written.  Professional editors have reviewed the book and we have worked with people who have many years of experience in this field.   This message is too important for us to take any short cuts - so we didn't!  It wasn't cheap, but with a message this important it had to be done right. When will the Book go to Print?The story is 100% complete so once we meet our fundraising goal we will be sending the book out for the first round of printing.  Our current goal is to have first edition copies physically in hand ready to distribute this coming fall (before the holidays- fingers crossed) and EBook versions ready even sooner!  What Does the Future Hold for Us?SJ the Monkey is intended to spread his special message of Snuggle Time to everyone around the world and so if things go well we hope to launch the book in the USA and then put it into other languages and distribute it around the world!  We also hope that eventually a second SJ the Monkey book will be created.   We also have a goal of creating SJ the Monkey plushies, a phone app/game, music and much more. We will be launching our very own website in the coming months as well.  Our true goal is to get as many people as possible to join us and promote this message of love through the precious moments we call Snuggle Time.  What would the world be like if a million people were moved enough to begin their own nightly snuggle time ritual? The possibilities are limitless so join us today as we change the world through ""Seth's Snuggle Time Game"" - one hug at a time! This campaign is just the start of our movement and we want to thank each and every one of you for taking the time to read through this and/or contribute and sponsor our campaign.  As we've said before we think Seth's Snuggle Time Game can change the world and with people like you helping us we will do exactly that - one hug at a time!",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p></p> <p>We the people are printing 535 ""big checks"" and will be delivering them to Congress on the week of April 10th, 2016 as part of the <a href=""http://democracyspring.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Democracy Spring</a> event. This is a critical week in DC, because thousands of people will be marching from Philadelphia to Washington D.C., risking arrest to put out the message to our government that the electorate are very serious about making Citizen Funded Elections the law of the land.  </p>
<p><b>These checks will be blank and fake. </b>We will attempting to deliver blank checks to every Legislator in Congress. This is an ironic gift, the checks will not be redeemable for actual cash. They signify that their electorate recognizes the fact that the lobbying industry buys favors from them, for every big political-facing issue, from the environment to energy, from healthcare to foreign policy, and that WE ARE NOT OKAY WITH THAT! We will mock your campaign finance system by giving you a big blank check in exchange for support of campaign finance reform and citizen funded elections. </p>
<p>So, we're printing 535 <u>BIG BLANK CHECKS</u> and will be <b>hand-signing them with your names</b>, and will be hand-delivering them to the US Capitol building in Washington D.C. the week of April 10th, 2016.</p>
<p>That's right! We have recruited enough people to hold checks and deliver them to Congress, showing them that we recognize their votes can be purchased, and that the people are NOT OKAY with that. We're asking them to support campaign finance reform and citizen funded elections, or be publically recognized as supporting the corrupt status quo.</p>

The most important first step towards fixing it is to completely restructure our campaign finance system to allow only publically funded elections.

</div>","We the people are printing 535 ""big checks"" and will be delivering them to Congress on the week of April 10th, 2016 as part of the Democracy Spring event. This is a critical week in DC, because thousands of people will be marching from Philadelphia to Washington D.C., risking arrest to put out the message to our government that the electorate are very serious about making Citizen Funded Elections the law of the land.  
These checks will be blank and fake. We will attempting to deliver blank checks to every Legislator in Congress. This is an ironic gift, the checks will not be redeemable for actual cash. They signify that their electorate recognizes the fact that the lobbying industry buys favors from them, for every big political-facing issue, from the environment to energy, from healthcare to foreign policy, and that WE ARE NOT OKAY WITH THAT! We will mock your campaign finance system by giving you a big blank check in exchange for support of campaign finance reform and citizen funded elections. 
So, we're printing 535 BIG BLANK CHECKS and will be hand-signing them with your names, and will be hand-delivering them to the US Capitol building in Washington D.C. the week of April 10th, 2016.
That's right! We have recruited enough people to hold checks and deliver them to Congress, showing them that we recognize their votes can be purchased, and that the people are NOT OKAY with that. We're asking them to support campaign finance reform and citizen funded elections, or be publically recognized as supporting the corrupt status quo.
Your donation entitles your name to be signed to one of the checks (or a number of other perks). 









We are a group of volunteers affiliated with Lawrence Lessig's superPAC MAYDAY (http://mayday.us). 


Zain Burghed - Co-organizer - The ""idea guy"" - I've volunteered with Mayday for about 6 months now. I started by donating to the super pac, and later I lobbied my senators to support the Fair Elections Now Act (FENA). It turns out our Washington State senators are staunchly opposed to fair elections. I came up with the idea of big fake blank checks for congress. I'm utilizing Mayday's volunteer network and the networks of sister organizations to make sure we have enough people to deliver these big fake blank checks to Congress, telling them that big money in politics is NOT OKAY! I know my picture is silly. It happened at a museum :) p.s. The fight for a proper democracy doesn't stop with politics. I'm creating a new economic democracy nonprofit startup (work in progress) where you choose how the economy moves forward with one equal vote. 





Brady Watson - Co-organizer - I've been involved with MAYDAY for about a year now.  It all started with a donation and I've taken on a larger volunteer role from there.  I believe campaign finance reform is the single most important issue facing our country today and working with MAYDAY is one way I've found to fight for reform.  I'm a videographer by trade but I've worked on a variety of projects for MAYDAY.  I think the big check idea is AWESOME because it symbolizes the corrupting power of money in politics in a funny yet compelling way.  Let's make it happen!



Daniel LaMagna - Co-Organizer - I got involved volunteering with MAYDAY after I heard Larry Lessig's TED talk on money in Washington. I believe corruption in politics is an issue that is bad for all Americans, regardless of their background, income level or political views. As the campaign's DC-local ""boots on the ground,"" I'm helping Zain organize this campaign because it's a great way to raise awareness and send a message to Congress that their vote should not be for sale. 


   
 Simply, our featured perk is we will sign your name to the big checks! If you give according to the perk, we will collect your full name and sign it in eloquent script on the check. We'll also send you a picture of a volunteer holding your check! 
 


We will attempt to deliver 535 big checks to Congress in Washington D.C. among the thousands already participating in Democracy Spring. We will try to deliver each blank check to the offices of every member of Congress. Whether the Capitol let's us do it or not is up to them ... however we will be attempting to register the delivery in advance with each Congressperson's office to make sure the event ""plays by the books."" If we are not allowed by the police to deliver the checks in person, we will send messages to each Congress Person to come out to the front lawn of the US Capitol building (a safe protest zone) to pick up their fake blank checks in exchange for supporting campaign finance reform and citizen funded elections. We will ask the Congress People or their respective staff members to take the ""Equal Voice For All Pledge"" in exchange for the big fake blank check. 

The pledge reads: 

“I pledge to fight for pro-democracy reform including citizen funding of elections, voting rights protections, anti-corruption measures, and a Constitutional Amendment to overturn Citizens United to ensure that Congress is free from the corrupting influence of big money in politics and solely dependent upon the People as equal citizens.”We will try to record their response in audio and/or video, delivering it to our photostream, and their reading of the pledge, to solidify your Congress Person's stance on this extremely important issue.

Will be buying plenty of ink (giant markers and paint) to sign the checks and create other signs. This will also pay for Campaign Archival efforts on the internet.

This will be a petty-cash reserve to pay for under-estimated budget items.

If we reach our $16000 goal to print the checks and deliver them to Congress whilst feeding our volunteers, we will create stretch goals to recreate this event in every state capitol.

We are working to end our backwards campaign finance system nationwide, so for every stretch goal we accomplish, we will deliver big fake blank checks to a State Legislature, showing them all that we are NOT OKAY with big money in politics, and openly mock their system by giving them big fake blank checks.

<p>Hemos visto
que entre las diversas problemáticas que existen en la colonia, una de las más
representativas son las relacionadas con el transporte y la movilidad de los
habitantes, pues los precios del transporte público son muy elevados, sumándose
a esto su ineficiencia y lo deficiente del servicio. Mucha de la gente
viaja en bicicletas inseguras o en mal estado, lo cual implica más
desgaste físico, más desgaste de la bici y por lo tanto un gasto económico
mayor en cambiar las piezas afectadas. Por otro lado, adquirir una bicicleta
nueva es un privilegio al cual pocos podemos acceder.</p>
<p><b>We have seen that among the various problems
that exist in the neighborhood, one of the most representative is the one
related to transportation and mobility of people, as prices of public
transportation are very high, adding to this inefficiency and a poor
service. Many people travel on unsafe bicycles or in poor condition, which
implies more physical wear, more wear on the bike and therefore greater
economic spending on changing the affected parts. On the other hand, obtaining
a new bike is a privilege that few can afford.</b></p>
<p>Por todo lo
anterior hemos decidido acondicionar el pequeño taller en Casa Naranja, el cual

Casa Naranja es un espacio okupado
que se ubica en Tlalnepantla de Baz, municipio localizado al norte del
Estado de México, México. Como centro social muchas y diversas personas hemos
trabajado desde hace 9 años con diferentes actividades políticas y culturales,
varias de ellas dirigidas a la gente del barrio.Nos hemos juntado con DOOMSDAY
BICI CLUB el cual es un colectivo de personas que difunden el uso político de
la bicicleta no sólo como medio de transporte sino como un medio de diversión y
juego crítico ante el sistema de consumo y dominación y los estereotipos que
rodean al mundo ciclista.
Casa Naranja is a squatted space located in
Tlalnepantla de Baz, a town in the north of the State of México, México. For
the last 9 years it has served as social center in which we have worked with
many people on different political and cultural activities, many of them aimed
at people in the same neighborhood. 
We have
partnered with DOOMSDAY BIKE CLUB which is a group of cool dudes and dudettes
who spread the political use of the bicycle not only as transportation but as a
means of fun and critical game against the system of consumption, domination
and stereotypes surrounding the cycling world.

En este andar juntxs queremos construir PEDALAXIA,
un Bici Taller comunitario autogestivo que responda realmente a las necesidades
de transporte de nuestra colonia y las colonias cercanas. Deseamos que sea un
espacio de aprendizaje e intercambio de conocimientos, de encuentro entre
personas que se sientan identificadas con la visión y misión del proyecto, que
los barrios se apropien del espacio de acuerdo a sus necesidades y que sea un
lugar en donde a través de talleres y otros medios podamos crear lazos
comunitarios, desarrollar nuestras autonomías y fortalecer las acciones que se
basan en la idea hazlo tu mismx.
We want to build PEDALAXY, a self-managed bike community workshop that
really meets the transportation needs of our neighborhood and nearby hoods. We
desire it to be a space for learning and knowledge sharing, where people that
identifies with the vision and mission of the project can meet, that the
neighbors appropriate the space as needed, and where through workshops and
other means we can create community ties, develop and strengthen our autonomous
actions based on the idea of do it yourself.

Además de aprender e intercambiar queremos incitar a
que las personas busquemos nuevas formas de relacionarnos con y entre nosotrxs,
con y en nuestros espacios y entornos para que juntxs investiguemos,
implementemos, experimentemos, reproduzcamos e innovemos otras maneras de usar
la bicicleta, incluso en un futuro compartir los saberes sobre las
tecnologías apropiadas con bicicletas tal como son las bicimáquinas.
 Moreover of learning and exchanging skills we
want to encourage people to seek new ways of relating within and with
themselves, with and within our spaces and environments, so that together we
can investigate, implement, experience, reproduce and innovate other ways to
use the bicycle. Even in the future, share the knowledge about appropriate
technologies with recycled bicycles just like what bike machines are.  

Hemos visto
que entre las diversas problemáticas que existen en la colonia, una de las más
representativas son las relacionadas con el transporte y la movilidad de los
habitantes, pues los precios del transporte público son muy elevados, sumándose
a esto su ineficiencia y lo deficiente del servicio. Mucha de la gente
viaja en bicicletas inseguras o en mal estado, lo cual implica más
desgaste físico, más desgaste de la bici y por lo tanto un gasto económico
mayor en cambiar las piezas afectadas. Por otro lado, adquirir una bicicleta
nueva es un privilegio al cual pocos podemos acceder.
We have seen that among the various problems
that exist in the neighborhood, one of the most representative is the one
related to transportation and mobility of people, as prices of public
transportation are very high, adding to this inefficiency and a poor
service. Many people travel on unsafe bicycles or in poor condition, which
implies more physical wear, more wear on the bike and therefore greater
economic spending on changing the affected parts. On the other hand, obtaining
a new bike is a privilege that few can afford.
Por todo lo
anterior hemos decidido acondicionar el pequeño taller en Casa Naranja, el cual
es austero y no contamos con suficiente herramienta
para poder trabajar más fuerte y tener un impacto mayor ante la situación de la
que hablamos antes, por lo tanto necesitamos el apoyo diverso de ustedes
las personas, colectivos, organizaciones y todo aquel que se sienta
identificadx con este nuevo proyecto!
Faced with this situation we decided to
improve the small workshop in Casa Naranja, which is austere and does not have
enough tools to work harder and have a greater impact on the situation we talked
about before, in this way we need your diverse support, as individuals, groups,
organizations and all who can identify with this new project!  









LO QUE NECESITAMOS
Nuestro objetivo es que PEDALAXIA sea
para 2016 un taller comunitario realmente autogestivo, por eso estamos haciendo
un llamado solidario para obtener fondos monetarios con los que podremos
rehabilitar el actual taller lo que implica comprar láminas para el techo y
compartimentos adecuados para organizar refacciones, accesorios y herramientas.
Con estos fondos también podremos adquirir más
bicicletas, las herramientas  y maquinaria adecuadas para su reparación y
mantenimiento, así como para  herrería y carpintería,  esto para la
construcción de bicimáquinas y demás modificaciones.


WHAT WE NEED
Our goal is that PEDALAXY will be in 2016 a
truly self-managed community workshop, so we are calling out for monetary fund
that can rehabilitate the current workshop which involves buying metal sheets
for proper roof and compartments to organize bike parts, accessories and
tools. 
With these funds we can also acquire more
bicycles, suitable tools and machinery 
for their repair and maintenance as well as blacksmithing and carpentry
for building the bike machines and other modifications.


LOS FONDOS SE DISTRIBUIRAN DE LA SIGUIENTE FORMA:

$ 2500. usd. : Incluye herramientas
especiales para bicicleta, herramientas complementarias (taladro, esmeril,
etc.) planta de soldar y compresor de aire.
$1500. usd. : Rehabilitación física del
techo del taller que incluye láminas metálicas, perfiles de acero, etc.
$1000. usd. : Insumos extras para
mantenimiento de las bicicletas, refacciones  y recompensas.
En el caso de que se junte más dinero en
esta campaña, lo usaríamos para mas juegos de herramientas, los cuales podrán
ser de muchísima utilidad durante los talleres de mecánica de bicicletas.


THE FUND WILL BE
DISTRIBUTED AS FOLLOWS:
$ 2500 usd. : It
includes tools especially for bikes, complementary tools (drill, grinder, etc.)
welding machine, air compressor.
$ 1500 usd. : Physical
rehabilitation for the workshop roof that
includes foils, steel sections, etc.
$ 1000 usd. : Extra
supplies for bike maintenance (oil, patches, etc.) spare parts and rewards.
In the event that more money comes together in this campaign, we would use it
for more toolkits, which can be extremely useful for the bicycles mechanics
workshop teachings.

<p>Good day, my name is Todd M. Kuikka. Thank you for taking time to consider the difficulty facing thousands of veterans and families during the reintegration back to civilian life. </p>
<p>As a 14-year veteran, I struggled with life after service to my country as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team Leader. I served multiple combat tours and successfully completed countless missions, overcame losses, and shared successes with my team. </p>
<p>But the hardest battle I faced was returning ""home"" and finding peace with my past and purpose in my future. I felt <i><b>alone</b></i> and yearned for the team I overcame so much with. </p>
<p><i>I was seeing my brothers and sisters in arms returning from hell and killing themselves and I was on the verge myself. I was scared! There had to be a better option that honors the service of these scarred warriors. </i></p>
<p>I started speaking with other vets and identifying healthy strategies on my civilian journey. Together with my veteran community and family, I found ways to utilize the core values that Uncle Sam bestowed in me to successfully navigate the trail back home to civilian life. </p>
<p>As a former combat team leader, I will not allow others to flail and fall if I can offer them support. We are morally obligated to keeping our military teams safe after their service. This book helps provide a safe path for veterans reintegrating into civilian life. I believe this opportunity could save the lives of our struggling brothers and sisters in arms. Veterans are never alone.  </p>

<p>     Rem's passion for fantastic worlds was a big part of her life since she was old enough to tell the difference between the villain and the hero. Stories enchanted and allowed her to see the world in a different way. They brought light over loneliness, bringing a new friend with every page she turned. Her love for travelling through different characters helped her battle life's own demons by sending them into oblivion, using a sword called hope. Her eyes started to see the magic in everything around her and one day her soul screamed for a story that needed to be told. That's how ""Above the Clouds"" was born. By telling the story of Stratus, the author explores the struggle of escaping from a society that doesn't give you the freedom to be yourself. </p>

<p>     Above the clouds is a fantasy novel written in an enchanting way, allowing readers to embark on a life-changing journey along with the main character. This story takes place in the land of Celestiopia, located above the clouds, invisible to the human eye. This realm was the home of beings with extraordinary powers. The story is centered around Stratus, a lonely, grumpy creature, who starts to question everything he had been taught. Pushed by a desire to be better and do more for the community, he decides to do whatever it takes to change his destiny. The struggles he faces along with the encounters he has, allow the character to evolve from a troubled introvert into a fearless leader. One of the themes of the novel is the constant chase for the ideal feeling of happiness, illustrated throughout the book as something an individual craves and needs in order to have a functional life. By telling the story of Stratus, I'm  telling the story of every person whom is trying to belong or is struggling to escape from a society that doesn't give them the freedom to be themselves.</p>

<div>

<p>Parents and teachers have long known that a child's brain can soak up information like a sponge. Our children take in everything they see and store it in their subconscious, creating their personality. What we expose them to is very important. The way each child perceives and senses the world is unique. While the body and mind constantly grow, perceptions also change. Children's sense of the material world and of the space around it also changes.<br/>Publishing a book like this gives me the opportunity to touch people and hopefully raise awareness that creativity in a child is very important and should be nourished at a young age. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>How reading to your child helps his development:</p>
<p>1 - Stories can help children cope with many feelings and problems and they learn things about the world just by enjoying the story.<br/></p>
<p>2. Reading books to children at bedtime is a wonderful bonding experience that nourishes emotional development. Parents can also help the child relate the incidents in the story to real events in their lives.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">3 - Reading books regularly stimulates children’s imagination and fosters natural curiosity.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">4 - Stories promote the devlopment of empathy.

</div></div>","Author Bio:


     Rem's passion for fantastic worlds was a big part of her life since she was old enough to tell the difference between the villain and the hero. Stories enchanted and allowed her to see the world in a different way. They brought light over loneliness, bringing a new friend with every page she turned. Her love for travelling through different characters helped her battle life's own demons by sending them into oblivion, using a sword called hope. Her eyes started to see the magic in everything around her and one day her soul screamed for a story that needed to be told. That's how ""Above the Clouds"" was born. By telling the story of Stratus, the author explores the struggle of escaping from a society that doesn't give you the freedom to be yourself. 
Founder of the company Creartscape Teh S.R.L., Rem is also passionate about video games. The game inspired from the novel, Above the Clouds, won people's choice awards at the Indie Prize Competition, hosted by Casual Connect in San Francisco, 2015. 
                                                          



What's the book about?



     For ages, the creatures dwelling in the realm of Celestiopia were shaped to be strong and honorable. Small in size, possessing extraordinary abilities, they were charged from birth with the duty to protect and guide the human world. When their homeland was shattered, the characters found themselves questioning everything they had been taught, in search of the truth behind what had happened.

    The Impact

As a pshychology major, I studied children's psychology and I always wanted to find a way to get involved in children's positive development, stimulate their creativity at a young age and help parents bond with their children more.
Parents and teachers have long known that a child's brain can soak up information like a sponge. Our children take in everything they see and store it in their subconscious, creating their personality. What we expose them to is very important. The way each child perceives and senses the world is unique. While the body and mind constantly grow, perceptions also change. Children's sense of the material world and of the space around it also changes.Publishing a book like this gives me the opportunity to touch people and hopefully raise awareness that creativity in a child is very important and should be nourished at a young age. 

How reading to your child helps his development:
1 - Stories can help children cope with many feelings and problems and they learn things about the world just by enjoying the story.
2. Reading books to children at bedtime is a wonderful bonding experience that nourishes emotional development. Parents can also help the child relate the incidents in the story to real events in their lives.
3 - Reading books regularly stimulates children’s imagination and fosters natural curiosity. Children quickly learn to visualize the scenarios mentioned in the stories by reading the text alone. This type of development works even better if a parent assists in the process. 
4 - Stories promote the devlopment of empathy. Fiction is a powerful vehicle for the development of empathy because the listeners (readers) automatically identify with one or more of the story's characters. In identifying, the listener experiences vicariously the sorrows, joys, triumphs, defeats and ethical conflicts of the protagonist - and maybe those of the antagonist, too.

<h3>C'est quoi, un CRM?</h3>
<p><span>Besoin de capter le signalétique de vos clients, mais aussi l'historique de vos interactions avec vos prospects? Besoin de fédérer votre équipe autour de vos processus commerciaux? Besoin de bétonner vos démarches commerciales (automatisation, approbation, escalation, etc)? Besoin de faire le lien avec vos initiatives marketing? Bingo, vous avez trouvé. C'est à cela que servent les applications CRM.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3>Le problème</h3>
<p>Mais voilà... Vous êtes dirigeant de PME, et vous savez comme c'est compliqué de lever le nez du guidon. Mais vous n'avez pas le temps. Et même si vous aviez le temps de chercher un CRM pour votre PME, vous ne sauriez pas par où commencer.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Votre entreprise galère donc encore et toujours avec des outils d'une autre époque. Excel et Outlook règnent en maître. Peut-être même utilisez-vous encore une application Access ou Filemaker qui tourne dans un coin... C'est la soupe aux données, c'est la foire aux fichiers et pourtant quand on cherche une info, on ne la trouve pas, ou alors elle est périmée, ou alors elle est en double et les doublons se contredisent...</span></p>
<p><span>N'importe quelle PME (et la vôtre aussi) a besoin de se structurer pour pouvoir se développer avec efficacité et surtout avec flexibilité. Aujourd'hui, plus besoin de faire appel aux informaticiens pour organiser votre entreprise: les outils sont largement disponibles sur le web, ils sont peu onéreux et ils en font un max! Ils offrent aux PME une puissance de feu à peine imaginable il y a quelques années encore.<br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Pourquoi j'ai écrit ce livre</h3>
<p>Un bon livre peut faire des miracles. Pour moi, un livre ""business"" ne doit pas seulement faire réfléchir, il doit aussi donner des clés et un plan pour passer à l'action. L'action, en ce qui vous concerne, c'est maintenant de trouver le meilleur CRM possible et de le déployer avec succès dans votre PME. Ce livre est là pour vous y aider.</p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Le contenu du livre</h3>
<p>Tout ce qu'il faut savoir pour vous lancer dans ce projet, et surtout pour le faire aboutir:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>analyser les CRM du marché</li>
<li>savoir quel CRM choisir</li>
<li>définir le rôle de votre CRM dans votre transformation digitale</li>
<li>gérer la relation avec l'éditeur et avec les consultants</li>
<li>comment formaliser votre fonds de commerce digital</li>
<li>comment impliquer votre équipe et lui faire adopter le bébé</li>
<li>comment profiter de l'occasion pour passer en mode agile</li>
<li>comment revisiter vos processus et automatiser un maximum</li>
<li>comment améliorer la collaboration et la communication interne</li>
<li>comment personnaliser votre marketing avec les données de votre CRM</li>
<li>comment aider vos collabrateurs au jour le jour</li>
<li>comment mieux servir vos clients</li>
</ul>
<h3>Comment cela va-t-il vous aider</h3>
</div><div>
<div>
<p>J'ai mis ma casquette de patron de PME et j'ai fait un inventaire précis, simple, structuré des étapes et des jalons qui doivent baliser votre projet CRM. Mon objectif est de vous faire gagner un maximum de temps. Avec ce livre, en me basant sur mon expérience CRM auprès d'une centaine d'entreprises, je vous aide à vous poser les bonnes questions et à faire les choses dans le bon ordre, sans vous éparpiller.</p>
<p>Le livre n'est pas un mode d'emploi ou un manuel, mais c'est plutôt un cheminement qui commence par une prise de conscience des enjeux: ""qu'est-ce qui se passe si je ne bouge pas?"". Il va ensuite vous aider à faire l'état des lieux de vos données et de vos processus, avec des outils simples et ludiques (des QCM, des tests, des jeux de rôles et des animations à faire en équipe). Vous allez apprendre à rassembler vos collaborateurs autour du projet, pour avancer de façon décomplexée et efficace, sans prise de tête. Il aborde des questions essentielles comme le choix de la plateforme, la motivation du staff, l'amélioration continue des données, l'automatisation marketing, etc.</p>
<p>J'ai voulu en faire un livre très pratico-pratique, mais inspirant et éclairant également.</p>

</div></div>","C'est quoi, un CRM?
Besoin de capter le signalétique de vos clients, mais aussi l'historique de vos interactions avec vos prospects? Besoin de fédérer votre équipe autour de vos processus commerciaux? Besoin de bétonner vos démarches commerciales (automatisation, approbation, escalation, etc)? Besoin de faire le lien avec vos initiatives marketing? Bingo, vous avez trouvé. C'est à cela que servent les applications CRM.

Le problème
Mais voilà... Vous êtes dirigeant de PME, et vous savez comme c'est compliqué de lever le nez du guidon. Mais vous n'avez pas le temps. Et même si vous aviez le temps de chercher un CRM pour votre PME, vous ne sauriez pas par où commencer.

Votre entreprise galère donc encore et toujours avec des outils d'une autre époque. Excel et Outlook règnent en maître. Peut-être même utilisez-vous encore une application Access ou Filemaker qui tourne dans un coin... C'est la soupe aux données, c'est la foire aux fichiers et pourtant quand on cherche une info, on ne la trouve pas, ou alors elle est périmée, ou alors elle est en double et les doublons se contredisent...
N'importe quelle PME (et la vôtre aussi) a besoin de se structurer pour pouvoir se développer avec efficacité et surtout avec flexibilité. Aujourd'hui, plus besoin de faire appel aux informaticiens pour organiser votre entreprise: les outils sont largement disponibles sur le web, ils sont peu onéreux et ils en font un max! Ils offrent aux PME une puissance de feu à peine imaginable il y a quelques années encore.

Pourquoi j'ai écrit ce livre
Un bon livre peut faire des miracles. Pour moi, un livre ""business"" ne doit pas seulement faire réfléchir, il doit aussi donner des clés et un plan pour passer à l'action. L'action, en ce qui vous concerne, c'est maintenant de trouver le meilleur CRM possible et de le déployer avec succès dans votre PME. Ce livre est là pour vous y aider.


Le contenu du livre
Tout ce qu'il faut savoir pour vous lancer dans ce projet, et surtout pour le faire aboutir:


analyser les CRM du marché
savoir quel CRM choisir
définir le rôle de votre CRM dans votre transformation digitale
gérer la relation avec l'éditeur et avec les consultants
comment formaliser votre fonds de commerce digital
comment impliquer votre équipe et lui faire adopter le bébé
comment profiter de l'occasion pour passer en mode agile
comment revisiter vos processus et automatiser un maximum
comment améliorer la collaboration et la communication interne
comment personnaliser votre marketing avec les données de votre CRM
comment aider vos collabrateurs au jour le jour
comment mieux servir vos clients

Comment cela va-t-il vous aider


J'ai mis ma casquette de patron de PME et j'ai fait un inventaire précis, simple, structuré des étapes et des jalons qui doivent baliser votre projet CRM. Mon objectif est de vous faire gagner un maximum de temps. Avec ce livre, en me basant sur mon expérience CRM auprès d'une centaine d'entreprises, je vous aide à vous poser les bonnes questions et à faire les choses dans le bon ordre, sans vous éparpiller.
Le livre n'est pas un mode d'emploi ou un manuel, mais c'est plutôt un cheminement qui commence par une prise de conscience des enjeux: ""qu'est-ce qui se passe si je ne bouge pas?"". Il va ensuite vous aider à faire l'état des lieux de vos données et de vos processus, avec des outils simples et ludiques (des QCM, des tests, des jeux de rôles et des animations à faire en équipe). Vous allez apprendre à rassembler vos collaborateurs autour du projet, pour avancer de façon décomplexée et efficace, sans prise de tête. Il aborde des questions essentielles comme le choix de la plateforme, la motivation du staff, l'amélioration continue des données, l'automatisation marketing, etc.
J'ai voulu en faire un livre très pratico-pratique, mais inspirant et éclairant également.





Pourquoi cette campagne?


La rédaction du livre est terminée. Reste à peaufiner la copie, et des confrères (que je remercie au passage) m'aident actuellement avec la relecture du manuscrit. La dernière étape sera alors la mise en page définitive et l'impression d'un premier tirage à 1000 exemplaires. Le but de cette campagne est tout simple: pouvoir lancer ce premier tirage et être dans les librairies en janvier 2016.
En participant à cette campagne, vous recevrez votre exemplaire du livre bien avant tout le monde. Mais en plus, vous en faites profiter d'autres: en fonction de la contrepartie choisie, vous recevez aussi un (ou plusieurs) exemplaire(s) pour les amis de votre choix, avec un petit mot leur disant que c'est vous qui leur offrez le livre.

<p>Douglas Boyer has written in retrospect as he reviews his
life’s journey. Through poetry and reflection, he has the uncanny ability to
draw the reader into his world where decades of escaped emotions are relived,
and dreams of a journey lost seem so far out of reach. In the darkness, the
author stretches with every fiber of his being, refusing to accept the
inevitable.</p>
<p>His writing reflects the dissatisfaction that accompanies
the pain of laboring through the change of lifestyle in which you’ve become
entangled. The dark habits hold you back. At the very moment when it appears
that you will become overwhelmed and sucked into nothingness, hope springs
eternal, and somewhere in the distance—light appears through the darkness
beckons to you (Luke 1:79.) </p>
<p>For the first time in your frightful, miserable, lonesome,
rock-bottom condition, you find yourself experiencing real freedom, real hope,
and a real power of choice. What a journey. Thank God for loving us when we
feel unlovable. Thank God for adopting us into His family; thank God for saving
us.</p>
<p>Through his prose, Brother Douglas does not paint a pretty
picture of himself or his former life. He keeps it real and to the point. It
was painful for him to relive, and the pain is still there as you read his
words The world of drug and alcohol addiction is ugly and largely misunderstood
by most of the world including the Church.</p>
<p>Many believe addiction it is a disease; it is not. Sickle
cell is a disease, and cancer is a disease. Addiction of any sort, including
nicotine, is a choice. Romans 7:14-25 defines it clearly. It is powerlessness!
Unless you’ve been there, you cannot academically or intellectually understand
it.</p>
<p>Brother Douglas pours out his confession before GOD and man.
He has done this openly, remorsefully, and I might add bravely. As one who has
been a “prisoner sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death” (Psalms 107:
1-16).</p>
<p>I recommend this reading. I also commend Brother Douglas for
writing it. For those living this lifestyle and want redemption through Christ,
read this for hope. You are not alone. For the spouses and children of those
who live with those living these lifestyles, trust that GOD surely hears your
prayers.</p>

Who had it before? What was it a witness to? The Pockets of Time tells the story of Americans from the 1940's to present day as coin goes from person to person and place to place. Some individuals are famous, most are people like your neighbors. It's about constant change, and yet how we are all connected in some way, even spanning time and people and events we're unaware of. It's about daily life, as well some historic events that have touched us all. <b>Follow along @PocketsOfTime #WhatWouldYourCoinSay</b></p>
<p><b>How I got the idea - a coin in a vending machine....</b></p>
<p>This idea started when my dad brought home a nickel from the vending machine at his workplace in 2006. The nickel was minted in 1945. The wheels in my head turned just thinking about what all has happened since then, and then where that specific coin had been. The idea was born for a series of books featuring coins from various eras and locations. The first being America from the 1940's to present day.</p>
<p><b>My vision for the story....</b></p>
<p>My vision for this historical fiction and adventure series, at least the first book is to champion American Exceptionalism, faith, redemption, breaking barriers, and displaying the bonds that tie us together in our humanity and communities. The story features several individual tales that overlap generations (of real stories and fictional ones), all finally connecting in the end via the coin. Along the way there are several side stories and adventures including several big moments in history and lives of celebrities. The coin itself is a vehicle that transports us across these American lives. My goal is to also complete a shorter children's version of the book that will feature the coin speaking as a narrator. </p>

<p>The book was a winner of the National Novel Writing Month in 2013. I managed to write 62,000 words that November. Due to numerous setbacks, I'm not ready to have this story published.

<b>Creative Challenge: Physical and reasonable limitations and expectations of a coin. </b>In theory a coin from the 1940's could have travelled through the hands of millions of people. In theory it could have just sat in one place for 70+ years as well. There's no practical way to write this story with having that many physical transactions between that many individuals - at least not in a way that wouldn't be tiresome, boring, or way too lengthy. I had to come up with creative ways for the coin to sit for various lengths of time, or for ways to fast forward. I believe I've done this fairly well, but adding a few more characters via your donations will help this process as well.</li>
<li>
<b>Creative Challenge:</b> <b>Balancing act between the extraordinary and the ordinary. </b>Balancing act between big historic events and regular daily life. Balancing act between historic figures and celebrities and regular Joe and Jane like you and I. I had to find the right mix and still keep this story interesting, fun, and believable. </li> <li>
<b>Creative Challenge: Avoiding ""Forest Gump"" or similar type tale.</b> I had this concern early on, but this naturally worked itself out in a few ways. 1. My story is simply different in style. 2. My story crosses multiple lives interconnecting, sometimes linked through past events or a common person, or just the coin itself, not solely the story of one individual impacting the lives of others. This is the tale of many impacting each other and the world around them. </li>
<li>
<b>Creative Challenge: Historic details.</b> What was the price of milk in 1965? When did the Denver Mint open? What was the average household income in 1955? What was the #1 song during a week in July in 1983 that might have been heard on the radio while traveling across the state of Kansas? What was a popular street for teens to hang out on in Jackson, Mississippi in the 1970's? Who was the Governor of Ohio in 1990? Who was the starting pitcher for a Cubs and Cardinals game in 1976? Some of these are easy to find, others are not. Subtle details, and these aren't necessarily in the book itself, but they are example of details I want to verify so I have an accurate historical story.</li>

During times of fear and upheaval in our native countries, many of us have no choice but to search in foreign lands for the chance to survive . . . hopefully, prayerfully, without losing our very selves. It is a struggle many must face during times of considerable change and uncertainty. It is a struggle surmounted only when we give our all.</p><p> </p><p>I am Maka Kverenchkiladze-Kartheiser, born in 1970 in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia. I spent my early life in this Soviet Union country, until I could no longer survive the fallout of their seventy years of rule. Before I left for a life I’d never expected to have, I graduated from Tbilisi State University with a BA and an MA in Arts of Georgian Language and Literature. Inspired by my father, I wish to continue my dreams of being an author and of using my experiences and discoveries to forge bonds between different yet beautiful countries and cultures.</p><p><strong> <i>A Soul Divided: </i></strong><strong><i>Memoir of a Modern Emigrant</i></strong><strong>, a story, years in the making. It is my personal journey from the European country of Georgia, my beloved homeland, to my cherished new foster country, the United States of America. </strong></p><p><strong>It is a story not unlike those of thousands of fellow emigrants who, like me, were and still are forced to move away from their homelands, leaving behind their lifelong friends, parents, and children . . . leaving behind a piece of their soul. </strong></p><p><strong>The struggle to find one’s place, one’s self, and one’s calling is universal; for emigrants, the struggle is even more to bear. We are destined to belong to two countries, and to neither. We are destined to dwell among those who fit, but not fit. We are destined to live life with a soul divided. And to live it our <i>best</i>.</strong></p><p><strong>This is a story of hope, inspiration, and strength to do what seems impossible. It takes you heart and soul into the experience of holding on to one’s identity, roots, and culture while taking in the best of one’s new culture. It leads you to make the most of each challenge and each relationship for the better future of the world.</strong></p><p> </p><p>I know many of you have been waiting for this book to be published. I am thankful for your constant support and encouragements throughout these years.

<p> </p>
<p>Far away in the east, over the Atlantic Ocean and across the Black Sea, between Turkey and Russia, there is a small but unique country named Georgia. It was called the Soviet Union before.</p> <p>I was born there in 1970 and lived under that regime for twenty-one years.</p>
<p>Then I was forced to emigrate from my homeland. Now I live in a new country. I belong to both nations . . . and to neither. Like my fellow immigrants, I am alone among tens of thousands who <i>do</i> belong.</p>
<p>Like other immigrants, I am a stranger amid the natural citizens. Another foreign face in a crowd.</p>
<p>Am I one of the  unseen?</p>

It is a blocky Jiguli with dark gray paint faded from time and the sun.</p><p>I open the back door, squeeze into the small space, and sit on the torn seat without hesitation. The smell of cigarettes, dampness of age, and gasoline hits my nose. It is a common smell in taxi cabs. I do not pay attention. The front seat leans toward me like it has been broken for many years. I ignore this also.</p><p>“To Vake, please,” I instruct the driver, “and you need to hurry. Please don’t procrastinate. Go!”</p><p>I don’t know if the wide-eyed cab driver senses my urgency, or he is scared of my ordering, or he just entertains the idea that there is going to be a scene like in an action movie, one which might be the highlight of his boring taxi-driving day, but he gets everything in order. He hits the pedal. The engine roars loudly, and the cab speeds forward. Soon the old car is rushing toward the Vake district of Tbilisi.</p><p>Anxiousness claws at my heart as the memories of what happened only minutes ago replay in my mind.</p><ul><li align=""center""> </li></ul><p>By eight in the morning, I arrived at the United States consulate, which by this time is so familiar to me. For two of my young sons and myself, I had applied for visas to America. Today would be my interview. Today I would learn whether we would be allowed to go to that country of hope.</p><p>The consulate is a two-floor brick building. It sits in an old, friendly neighborhood of homes that are two or three floors tall. Houses are very close with small yards connecting neighbors. Neighbors often sit in front of their doorways and chat with each other’s families.</p><p>Fresh laundry floats with a nice breeze, and sun rays shine through white linens. The smell of freshness is in the air. Here and there stand giant, one-hundred-year-old, broad-trunked plane trees. They lay shade over some homes and yards and a few of the only four or five cars parked on the street.</p><p>I stand on the asphalt-paved sidewalk in front of the consulate. The sidewalk is not smooth. Over the last years, no one has taken care of it, so in many places the asphalt is chipped away and has holes. Also, the plane tree roots, as they always do, try to find their way above the asphalt, making small hilly bumps. I watch my steps as I walk the thirty or more feet toward the consulate.</p><p>At the door, men in uniform stand guard. A crowd of waiting people with papers gives out the feeling that something hopeful is going on here. But other than that, there is not much significant sign that a United States consulate is here.</p><p>Outside the consulate, the number of people hoping to go to America, for improving life conditions or education, compared with five years ago, is much less. In 1999, the first time I stood in that line waiting for my turn, three hundred or more people waited. How festively dressed those people came, hoping for their own “visa-getting ceremonial!” In that time America was a brand-new idea, and, as with everything new, exciting expectation glowed in faces. Sparkles of happiness were in people’s eyes. Big sparkles.</p><p>That waiting went on every day, for years. Each of the times I traveled to America, the number of people applying for visas was a little less. Now perhaps there are only fifty people who stand in line. The sparkle is still there, but it’s calmer. They have heard stories from friends and acquaintances about emigrants’ wages helping their families to survive. Now their expectations about working as nannies or caregivers, or even just getting visas, are more realistic.</p><p>I join them in the line.</p><p>“What time is your interview?” someone asks me with curiosity. We are almost each other’s competitors here.</p><p>“It’s at eleven,” I answer.</p><p>I have a three-hour wait—quite a bit of time to be here.</p><p>I don’t understand why we come so early if we have an appointed time, but maybe this is a Georgian understanding of an appointment. Or maybe we are so excited for possible opportunities that we can’t stay at home. We would rather stay among people with the same interests and talk, and even make jokes with them.</p><p>Warmth and the smell of the blooming flowers of May are in the air. The weather definitely is lifting our mood. At this moment everyone sees the future in bright colors, because we are all dreaming of visas to America so we can help our desperate families.</p><p>I am thirty-four and a single parent with three sons to provide for. The only work I can find here is 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., for 4 GEL (<em>Georgian Lari, our currency</em>)—about $1.70 usd. Not as an hourly wage, but for twelve hours’ work. It is not enough to feed anyone.</p><p>The door of the consulate opens. Someone’s name is called, sending a wave of excitement and also worry through the crowd, because not everyone will be granted a visa to America. A person enters for the first appointment.</p><p>Even now, I reflect, nearly fourteen years after the Soviet Union’s collapse, people still struggle to find ways to survive.</p><p>Growing up, I never thought to live in the United States. I never thought to leave Georgia. Georgia brims with a culture rich in art and literature, and with amazing nature: tall, Swiss-like mountains of the Caucasus, the dramatic Black Sea, and vineyards as beautiful as those of Italy. It was a blessing to call such a place home. Not even soviet rule could take this away.</p><p>We tell the following fable about how we came to possess the land we claim to be so beautiful in the world. When God was distributing the land to all the peoples of Earth, the Georgians were feasting, toasting, and doing some serious drinking. As a result, they arrived late and were told by God that all the land had already been distributed.</p><p>“What were you doing that was so important you are late for this occasion?” God asked.</p><p>“Dear Lord, we are late only because we were lifting our glasses in praise of you!”</p><p>God was so pleased with the answer that he gave them the part of Earth that was the most beautiful, which he had been reserving for himself.</p><p>As a young adult, I became one of the many American immigrants who, during times of complete uncertainty in our native countries, went to foreign lands that gave them possibilities to survive. Immigrants are people tested by life, and their fight for survival is both difficult and painful.</p><p>What is the pain for? Homeland-less-ness, parents-less-ness, childhood-friends-less-ness in that cherished, distant foster country. It has given to me so much—house, family, and new friends—yet the ones I have to leave behind cannot be replaced.</p><p>Living far away from the place my roots are planted, my heart has become divided into two parts. One part belongs to my homeland. The other holds fast to my foster country, the United States of America.</p><p>I have endured many sleepless nights with thousands of questions resonating in my mind. Many hours have been lost in guilty feelings about leaving my homeland. “Why did I move out from my country? Why did I leave the place where I had a childhood full of meaningful memories, and parents and friends I could depend on? Why did I come to America? What am I doing here?” And the most confusing, “Where do I belong?”</p><p>I live with this pain inside. All emigrants do. This pain will never leave us. Our hearts are always divided.</p><p> </p><p>Person after person walks into the consulate, full of hope. After a time, some come out with quick steps and a serious look on their faces, trying not to look at anyone. They would love to disappear from waiting people’s curiosity. It’s impossible, though. Everyone is interested to know where destiny has taken them.</p><p>Endless questions start to fly from different areas of the waiting line.</p><p>“Have they issued a visa for you?”</p><p>“What kind of questions did they ask?”</p><p>“What did they tell you?”</p><p>These questions stay unanswered, as no one knows why they have not been given the opportunity to go to America.</p><p>Others come out with huge smiles on their faces. Their happiness is very quiet, as if they left all their words inside. No one in line asks questions. We know they have gotten visas to the country where dreams are coming true. “Congratulations” fly in the air to the winners. We watch them leave, and then we return to our imaginings that in a few hours we will feel the same happiness.</p><p>Finally, it is my turn! I let out a breath of release then enter the doorway.</p><p>I am directed to a small room. Inside, five guards stand by security cameras and check everyone who enters.</p><p>One of them politely addresses me. “Take out your passport and put your purse here, please.”</p><p>I hand my passport to him, feeling very happy. I am confident I will be granted the three visas for my sons and myself.</p><p>A professional-looking young man looks through my passport and the application form. Then he frowns. “This picture is small! Your photo should be two-by-two inches in size.”</p><p>My thoughts and heart suddenly traffic-jam together.</p><p>“What—?”</p><p>“And whose pictures are these?” he asks. “Are these children trying to apply for visas too?”</p><p>“Yes.” I felt something unpleasant sink inside of me.</p><p>“Where are they?”</p><p>“They are at home,” I answer with fear.</p><p>“Well, everyone who is applying should be here!”</p><p>“Should be here? What do you mean?” I am completely confused. I am unable to think.</p><p>“Yes, they should be here!” his voice firmly repeats.</p><p>“What do you mean? What should I do?” My mind still can’t think.</p><p>“You need to bring them here.”</p><p>“How I am going to bring them here? My appointment is at eleven o’clock. It is almost eleven!” In a second everything collapses on me. It took weeks to get this appointment.</p><p>All my hopes, all my dreams, all my thoughts scatter. With my eyes I beg someone to tell me what to do.</p><p>The young men gather near me. “Well, where are your sons now?” one asks.</p><p>Their faces say they want to help. I can feel they are really sincere.</p><p>“One is at school. The second one is at home,” I mumble.</p><p>“Well, what we can tell you is that you can go home and then bring them here. As long you are here before one o’clock, you are good. We know and we will let you in.”</p><p>They really are trying to help.</p><p>Now I know what to do. I have to run.</p><p>And I run.</p><p>Outside the consulate, people in line call after me. “Hey, ma’am, what’s going on?” “Where are you going? Weren’t you supposed to have an interview?”</p><p>I run, leaving the questions to fade in the sun rays and shadows behind me.</p><p>I need to bring my sons here . . . and in less than two hours! How am I going to do that?</p><p>My mind resumes its processes. A plan comes together in my thoughts. There is no time to lose. Now, actions are needed.</p><p>I run to the main street where I will catch a taxi cab.</p><p><i>When life gives you challenges, you have no choice—you have to fight,</i> I tell myself.</p><p>“Taxi!” I call.</p><ul><li align=""center""> </li></ul><p>Now the soviet Jiguli speeds toward the Vake district. I dial my cell phone. My mother answers.</p><p>“Mom, you need to bribe Sandro with any possible bribe so he gets dressed. I am coming to pick him up. I need to take the boys to the consulate for an interview, and we have very little time.”</p><p>Mom assures me she will. In her voice I hear the same urgency that I feel. We both hang up. With the short call, I have stolen what time I am able.</p><p>The first move has been made.</p><p>Wanting to go to America, yet wanting to stay in my homeland, I look out the cab window and fill my eyes with Tbilisi.</p><p>When I left to go to the consulate, few cars moved in the streets, as the city still lay asleep. Many jobs start around nine or ten each morning, reflecting Europe’s laidback lifestyle. Well-rested people have more energy to work, and most don’t spend so much money on possessions that they have to work more to pay for it all. They value simplicity of life, but also quality and artistry of effort that beautifies life.</p><p>Five-floor condominium buildings in European architectural style are switching each other as the taxi passes them. Rows of huge plane trees line the way, interspersing my view. Detailed ornamental pieces on buildings, shops with wide gallery windows, sidewalks with wide tiles . . . many times these have been compared with the streets of Paris.</p><p>Well-dressed people with business appearance stroll toward destinations. Most women wear dresses and high heels, and men wear dress pants and suit jackets.</p><p>Georgian people have an old, rich culture of the arts and love to wear intellectual styles. It is in character to always look presentable, no matter our circumstances.</p><p>Gray and dark colors of clothing dominate the streets. Is this a result of Georgia’s challenging years? I see seriousness and thoughtful eyes on people’s faces. They all have lot on their minds: “What shall I do? How might I improve living?”</p><p>These are the worries they have been dealing with since the Soviet Union collapsed.</p><p>Well, the university is right here—I just passed by. And there it is—the philharmonic concert hall! Outside it stands the famous bronze statue of <i>Lady Muse</i>, an affirmation of Georgia’s artistic soul.</p><p>The car carries me forward, nearer to three visas to my beloved new foster country.</p><p>But my thoughts carry me backward, to my childhood in my treasured homeland of Georgia, to one precious, unforgettable summer when I was twelve.</p><ul><li align=""center""> </li></ul><p>Summers with my parents and older brother in Kvishkheti, a small village tucked among the high peaks of the Caucasus Mountains in east Georgia, have left an indelible imprint on my young imagination and thinking. It is not merely a village. It is a vacation house for writers and creative people, a place enveloped by beauty and fresh climate.</p><p>Many well-known authors and artists, together with their families, spend summer vacations here. They produce new novels, poems, and works of art—inspiring and being inspired.</p><p>The first time my parents brought me here, I was three years old. It has been part of my dad’s job, as an author with the Georgian Writer’s Union, to manage the Kvishkheti library and literary events for vacationers. In this wondrous place, my every July and August is filled with joy and carelessness. Every year the same families and children come and spend time here. It is like being in one big family that we see again every summer. Everyone knows each other, shares similar interests, and is connected.</p><p>Originally this huge land and its buildings was the residence of a writer and public person who lived in the late nineteenth century.</p><p>A large part of Kvishkheti is surrounded by a green steel-pole fence that is six feet tall. And the gate! It is the same green with a heavy metal door that has a small lock. One has to push down the handle, and you are in! The gate plays a pretty important role. It is a divider between “writers” and “non-writers,” as we call vacationers, based on where they stay—either inside the more than five acres of fence line, or outside of it, where vacationers rent houses from the locals. These “non-writers” are equally our dear friends, year after year.</p><p>Inside the fence the main building, once the primary residence, now is for us to use. There are about fifty rooms. One room is given in rent to one family, so many families can visit here together. Bathrooms and showers are located in the lower level for shared use.</p><p>On the main floor is a huge ballroom with a fireplace. In the center of one wall is a portrait of the writer who lived in this house. The ballroom also holds a large balcony with windows that overlook the grounds.</p><p>From the balcony, a breathtaking view opens up. A wide valley with railroad tracks carries a train away to Batumi, a port on the Black Sea. A forest extends as far as eyes can see, and it is mixed—evergreen trees and trees with leaves. The forest covers mountains that form a big bowl around us.</p><p>All this picturesque mountain scenery bridges eastern Georgia and western Georgia.</p><p>The climate here is freshest, but it also has curative qualities. It cures lung disease, clears lungs, and makes lungs strong again.</p><p>The property itself holds tall, century-old Tilia caucasica trees. They form a huge walkway, and green wooden park benches line the walkway’s edges, facing each other across the aisle, some with small tables beside them.</p><p>These trees are an entertainment for us. They grow green seeds, which themselves hold black seeds inside. We pick the green seeds, open them up, and make black seed necklaces for ourselves. We use sewing thread and needle for this. The black seed is smaller than a sunflower seed, but we very patiently sit, make a hole with the needle, and one after another put seeds on the thread. Sometimes a finished necklace is so long that it reaches to a belly button. We compare and had fun. Who can count how many necklaces we children have made since we began coming here? The names of my girlfriends are Tamara, Eka, Sofio, Nino, Maia. The boys are Gio, Irakli, Sandro, Levan, David. . . .</p><p>The benches have produced cherished memories as well. On every bench a writer sits and writes a poem, thinks about a novel, or worries about characters of a drama piece. Other people sit and draw still life art or paint portraits that museums will one day display, all while we children walk along and watch.</p><p>Every afternoon my dad sits on one of the benches with his pen and notebook or with books he has brought along. He is constantly reading or writing.</p><p>The summer I am twelve, my admiration of his gift stirs me to also become a writer.</p><p>Everyone is inspired in this magical, creative place.</p><p>This late nineteenth century writer’s residence is one of few such residences that survived the hands of the Communist Party. After Communist power spread in the early 1900s, according to their ideology, owners of larger properties or houses across Georgia were seized. Communist philosophy: Take away from the rich and give it to the poor! They evicted owners of big houses and land and lodged many poor families on each property.</p><p>The destructive path of the Communists has been bloody. Their painful system and practices, which has ruled us for generations, has killed millions of innocent people and tortured the intelligent public into submission.</p><p>By odds, however, this particular property in Kvishkheti was not divided between many different families. In favor of intelligentsia, it was transformed into a place where people now spend time creating, where they enrich their imaginations and souls by being closer to nature.</p><p>No matter how many forbidden rules we face under Communism, we’ve had some great life experiences growing up, many of them in Kvishkheti.</p><ul><li align=""center""> </li></ul><p>In the taxi, holding to the top of the front seat and still about four minutes from home, I reflect that we also experienced many difficult times over the years.</p><p>As children, we were left without a choice. We had to become young communists.</p><p>From age six to twelve, we were called Octobrist. The name came from the union, which was founded on October 17, 1905. Each of us wore a small medal with a portrait of a six-year-old curly-haired boy named Vladimir, who later was known as Lenin.</p><p>Then we grew up a little and became Pioneers. To show our readiness to serve the party, we again wore a small medal with Lenin’s teenage face. We also wore red bandanas around our necks, stood straight up, and saluted to the regime.</p><p>Every morning a leader of the Pioneers would ask us in a commanding tone, “Young communists, are you ready to serve the Communist Party?”</p><p>“We are ready,” we had to answer, and no other answer was even considered.</p><p>All of us hated this routine, the bandanas, and the whole concept itself. But who would even dare and show their true feelings?</p><p>Then as teenagers we turned into Komsomols. The word was an abbreviation of the Russian phrase Kommunisticheskii Soyuz Molodyozhi, which itself stood for All-Union Leninist Young Communist League.</p><p>Strict dress codes made all of this worse. Girls wore pleated, brown wool dresses, the same over and over every day. Nothing changed for ten years, only the size of the dress. Guys wore deep blue suits—almost dark gray—and white shirts, all the time. These ugly, boring uniforms induced negative feelings in us. We all looked and felt the same.</p><p>The communists definitely blocked individualism in us. The colors of our thoughts were gray and brown, just like the outfits we wore.</p><p>Growing up under communism, life itself had colorless colors.</p><p>I wore ugly glasses, which was not a surprise. The Soviet Union had no style. Big, heavy frames almost covered my face, but still you were able to see the green eyes, which, over the years, received many compliments. My haircut was short, no particular style or shape. Nothing special.</p><p>Memories of my school experience are pretty pale. Over the years I realized how communism did not develop personality qualities in us, nor did it flourish our interests. The soviet system did not encourage individualism as a concept.</p><p>The school where I spent all eleven years of my education was prestigious in the city. The lady director, very tough and strict, eventually led the school to success. But we were victims of the soviet system. School reflected the system’s requirements. It locked our self-esteem. The “fair” outlined our views—everything was based on fair. That’s why no one loved to go to school. Every morning we would go because we had to.</p><p>But the soviet educational system had a few good benefits. It provided a wide range of knowledge. We read and studied works of classic writers from all over the world.</p><p>The history of the world was taught precisely, which gave us deep knowledge of other countries’ highlights.</p><p>We learned geography, science, and foreign languages. The Russian language remained as the mandatory language in the entire Soviet Union’s school system. Together with the native language, we had to learn Russian from the first grade.</p><p>Looking from the positive side, knowing Russian enabled us to read original writings of many great Russian authors.</p><p>What we disliked was the history of the Soviet Union, which was based on lies but shown as the greatness of the party.</p><p>They tried to engrave this false greatness in every child. Yes, we as children realized all these falsities, but who would disagree? We had to memorize lies and live life with them.</p><p>In school, we knew we were taught lies. We didn’t like it. And inside of us we, children of the ’80s, protested. My generation, unlike my parents’ generation, was not that scared. We were quietly rebellious.</p><p>Yet I saw firsthand the consequences of censure against free thinking. My brother, Levan, who always had some non-communist ideas, one day faced the pressure of system.</p><p>It was the day his class had a class president’s election. Well, the word “election” was just a word, without actual meaning behind it.</p><p>Forty-two classmates, boys and girls, all looked very neat on that day, all prepared for the big decision.</p><p>At the head of the class, the teacher, Mrs. Lomidze, coldly announced, “Today we are going to choose your class president. Giorgi is nominated to be class president. We will ask you a question, and by raising your hand to agree or disagree, we will decide about Giorgi.”</p><p>Students’ faces didn’t show much expression. Students did not think. They just followed whatever would be told.</p><p>Satisfied, the teacher started the “voting” process. “Who agrees that Giorgi will be class president for this school year?”</p><p>Everyone raised up a hand, without hesitation and without any reaction on their face.</p><p>“Is anyone opposed to Giorgi’s candidature?” Mrs. Lomidze continued with mandatory responsibility. No one should have disagreed, and she didn’t expect that anyone would.</p><p>But just as the teacher was going to announce the election’s results, my brother raised his hand.</p><p>“Levan?” she asked. “What’s going on? Why are you raising your hand?”</p><p>The teacher did not even connect the idea that someone would reject the nomination of the person she had decided.</p><p>“I reject the candidature of Giorgi!” Levan’s voice was firm and clear.</p><p>“You what? Reject?” Mrs. Lomidze’s voice carried irritation and anger that concerned the children.</p><p>That day after the break, the principal’s assistant approached Levan. “You need to bring your parents tomorrow to school. It is the principal’s request!”</p><p> My parents were very scared. “Levan, what are you doing to us?”</p><p>My parents were summoned to the school in front of the principal and teachers. They were condemned for their son’s behavior.</p><p>In class Levan’s inquisitive mind remained conflicted. He had difficulty with just following what he was told to think or to say without expressing his ideas or opinions.</p><p>He wondered, “Why are people not allowed to have a different point of view?”</p><p>My mom worried till the death, “Where is he getting all of these ‘free’ ideas?”</p><p>One day I discovered the answer. While I was searching for some item in my parents’ closet, I came to a big, heavy sack. Naively I moved it closer and glanced inside. <i>Magazines!</i> Big Russian letters read, <i>AMERICA</i>.</p><p>I slid my hand over a glossy cover. The pages were so smooth, so durable. Something mysteriously pulled me closer. My interest was triggered, and I started to flip the pages. Large, colorful pictures of American architecture. Skyscrapers. Jazz musicians.

During times of fear and upheaval in our native countries, many of us have no choice but to search in foreign lands for the chance to survive . . . hopefully, prayerfully, without losing our very selves. It is a struggle many must face during times of considerable change and uncertainty. It is a struggle surmounted only when we give our all. I am Maka Kverenchkiladze-Kartheiser, born in 1970 in Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia. I spent my early life in this Soviet Union country, until I could no longer survive the fallout of their seventy years of rule. Before I left for a life I’d never expected to have, I graduated from Tbilisi State University with a BA and an MA in Arts of Georgian Language and Literature. Inspired by my father, I wish to continue my dreams of being an author and of using my experiences and discoveries to forge bonds between different yet beautiful countries and cultures. A Soul Divided: Memoir of a Modern Emigrant, a story, years in the making. It is my personal journey from the European country of Georgia, my beloved homeland, to my cherished new foster country, the United States of America. It is a story not unlike those of thousands of fellow emigrants who, like me, were and still are forced to move away from their homelands, leaving behind their lifelong friends, parents, and children . . . leaving behind a piece of their soul. The struggle to find one’s place, one’s self, and one’s calling is universal; for emigrants, the struggle is even more to bear. We are destined to belong to two countries, and to neither. We are destined to dwell among those who fit, but not fit. We are destined to live life with a soul divided. And to live it our best.This is a story of hope, inspiration, and strength to do what seems impossible. It takes you heart and soul into the experience of holding on to one’s identity, roots, and culture while taking in the best of one’s new culture. It leads you to make the most of each challenge and each relationship for the better future of the world. I know many of you have been waiting for this book to be published. I am thankful for your constant support and encouragements throughout these years. The project has reached its most important process, that of editing and self-publishing, and this is why I am asking for your help.You can give assistance in two ways:

Far away in the east, over the Atlantic Ocean and across the Black Sea, between Turkey and Russia, there is a small but unique country named Georgia. It was called the Soviet Union before. I was born there in 1970 and lived under that regime for twenty-one years.
Then I was forced to emigrate from my homeland. Now I live in a new country. I belong to both nations . . . and to neither. Like my fellow immigrants, I am alone among tens of thousands who do belong.
Like other immigrants, I am a stranger amid the natural citizens. Another foreign face in a crowd.
Am I one of the  unseen?
 
   
                                                                           Chapter One                                     A Heart Divided  Tbilisi, GeorgiaMay 5, 2004 When life gives you challenges, you have no choice—you have to fight, I tell myself.“Taxi!” I call.An old soviet style car rolls to a stop. It is a blocky Jiguli with dark gray paint faded from time and the sun.I open the back door, squeeze into the small space, and sit on the torn seat without hesitation. The smell of cigarettes, dampness of age, and gasoline hits my nose. It is a common smell in taxi cabs. I do not pay attention. The front seat leans toward me like it has been broken for many years. I ignore this also.“To Vake, please,” I instruct the driver, “and you need to hurry. Please don’t procrastinate. Go!”I don’t know if the wide-eyed cab driver senses my urgency, or he is scared of my ordering, or he just entertains the idea that there is going to be a scene like in an action movie, one which might be the highlight of his boring taxi-driving day, but he gets everything in order. He hits the pedal. The engine roars loudly, and the cab speeds forward. Soon the old car is rushing toward the Vake district of Tbilisi.Anxiousness claws at my heart as the memories of what happened only minutes ago replay in my mind. By eight in the morning, I arrived at the United States consulate, which by this time is so familiar to me. For two of my young sons and myself, I had applied for visas to America. Today would be my interview. Today I would learn whether we would be allowed to go to that country of hope.The consulate is a two-floor brick building. It sits in an old, friendly neighborhood of homes that are two or three floors tall. Houses are very close with small yards connecting neighbors. Neighbors often sit in front of their doorways and chat with each other’s families.Fresh laundry floats with a nice breeze, and sun rays shine through white linens. The smell of freshness is in the air. Here and there stand giant, one-hundred-year-old, broad-trunked plane trees. They lay shade over some homes and yards and a few of the only four or five cars parked on the street.I stand on the asphalt-paved sidewalk in front of the consulate. The sidewalk is not smooth. Over the last years, no one has taken care of it, so in many places the asphalt is chipped away and has holes. Also, the plane tree roots, as they always do, try to find their way above the asphalt, making small hilly bumps. I watch my steps as I walk the thirty or more feet toward the consulate.At the door, men in uniform stand guard. A crowd of waiting people with papers gives out the feeling that something hopeful is going on here. But other than that, there is not much significant sign that a United States consulate is here.Outside the consulate, the number of people hoping to go to America, for improving life conditions or education, compared with five years ago, is much less. In 1999, the first time I stood in that line waiting for my turn, three hundred or more people waited. How festively dressed those people came, hoping for their own “visa-getting ceremonial!” In that time America was a brand-new idea, and, as with everything new, exciting expectation glowed in faces. Sparkles of happiness were in people’s eyes. Big sparkles.That waiting went on every day, for years. Each of the times I traveled to America, the number of people applying for visas was a little less. Now perhaps there are only fifty people who stand in line. The sparkle is still there, but it’s calmer. They have heard stories from friends and acquaintances about emigrants’ wages helping their families to survive. Now their expectations about working as nannies or caregivers, or even just getting visas, are more realistic.I join them in the line.“What time is your interview?” someone asks me with curiosity. We are almost each other’s competitors here.“It’s at eleven,” I answer.I have a three-hour wait—quite a bit of time to be here.I don’t understand why we come so early if we have an appointed time, but maybe this is a Georgian understanding of an appointment. Or maybe we are so excited for possible opportunities that we can’t stay at home. We would rather stay among people with the same interests and talk, and even make jokes with them.Warmth and the smell of the blooming flowers of May are in the air. The weather definitely is lifting our mood. At this moment everyone sees the future in bright colors, because we are all dreaming of visas to America so we can help our desperate families.I am thirty-four and a single parent with three sons to provide for. The only work I can find here is 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., for 4 GEL (Georgian Lari, our currency)—about $1.70 usd. Not as an hourly wage, but for twelve hours’ work. It is not enough to feed anyone.The door of the consulate opens. Someone’s name is called, sending a wave of excitement and also worry through the crowd, because not everyone will be granted a visa to America. A person enters for the first appointment.Even now, I reflect, nearly fourteen years after the Soviet Union’s collapse, people still struggle to find ways to survive.Growing up, I never thought to live in the United States. I never thought to leave Georgia. Georgia brims with a culture rich in art and literature, and with amazing nature: tall, Swiss-like mountains of the Caucasus, the dramatic Black Sea, and vineyards as beautiful as those of Italy. It was a blessing to call such a place home. Not even soviet rule could take this away.We tell the following fable about how we came to possess the land we claim to be so beautiful in the world. When God was distributing the land to all the peoples of Earth, the Georgians were feasting, toasting, and doing some serious drinking. As a result, they arrived late and were told by God that all the land had already been distributed.“What were you doing that was so important you are late for this occasion?” God asked.“Dear Lord, we are late only because we were lifting our glasses in praise of you!”God was so pleased with the answer that he gave them the part of Earth that was the most beautiful, which he had been reserving for himself.As a young adult, I became one of the many American immigrants who, during times of complete uncertainty in our native countries, went to foreign lands that gave them possibilities to survive. Immigrants are people tested by life, and their fight for survival is both difficult and painful.What is the pain for? Homeland-less-ness, parents-less-ness, childhood-friends-less-ness in that cherished, distant foster country. It has given to me so much—house, family, and new friends—yet the ones I have to leave behind cannot be replaced.Living far away from the place my roots are planted, my heart has become divided into two parts. One part belongs to my homeland. The other holds fast to my foster country, the United States of America.I have endured many sleepless nights with thousands of questions resonating in my mind. Many hours have been lost in guilty feelings about leaving my homeland. “Why did I move out from my country? Why did I leave the place where I had a childhood full of meaningful memories, and parents and friends I could depend on? Why did I come to America? What am I doing here?” And the most confusing, “Where do I belong?”I live with this pain inside. All emigrants do. This pain will never leave us. Our hearts are always divided. Person after person walks into the consulate, full of hope. After a time, some come out with quick steps and a serious look on their faces, trying not to look at anyone. They would love to disappear from waiting people’s curiosity. It’s impossible, though. Everyone is interested to know where destiny has taken them.Endless questions start to fly from different areas of the waiting line.“Have they issued a visa for you?”“What kind of questions did they ask?”“What did they tell you?”These questions stay unanswered, as no one knows why they have not been given the opportunity to go to America.Others come out with huge smiles on their faces. Their happiness is very quiet, as if they left all their words inside. No one in line asks questions. We know they have gotten visas to the country where dreams are coming true. “Congratulations” fly in the air to the winners. We watch them leave, and then we return to our imaginings that in a few hours we will feel the same happiness.Finally, it is my turn! I let out a breath of release then enter the doorway.I am directed to a small room. Inside, five guards stand by security cameras and check everyone who enters.One of them politely addresses me. “Take out your passport and put your purse here, please.”I hand my passport to him, feeling very happy. I am confident I will be granted the three visas for my sons and myself.A professional-looking young man looks through my passport and the application form. Then he frowns. “This picture is small! Your photo should be two-by-two inches in size.”My thoughts and heart suddenly traffic-jam together.“What—?”“And whose pictures are these?” he asks. “Are these children trying to apply for visas too?”“Yes.” I felt something unpleasant sink inside of me.“Where are they?”“They are at home,” I answer with fear.“Well, everyone who is applying should be here!”“Should be here? What do you mean?” I am completely confused. I am unable to think.“Yes, they should be here!” his voice firmly repeats.“What do you mean? What should I do?” My mind still can’t think.“You need to bring them here.”“How I am going to bring them here? My appointment is at eleven o’clock. It is almost eleven!” In a second everything collapses on me. It took weeks to get this appointment.All my hopes, all my dreams, all my thoughts scatter. With my eyes I beg someone to tell me what to do.The young men gather near me. “Well, where are your sons now?” one asks.Their faces say they want to help. I can feel they are really sincere.“One is at school. The second one is at home,” I mumble.“Well, what we can tell you is that you can go home and then bring them here. As long you are here before one o’clock, you are good. We know and we will let you in.”They really are trying to help.Now I know what to do. I have to run.And I run.Outside the consulate, people in line call after me. “Hey, ma’am, what’s going on?” “Where are you going? Weren’t you supposed to have an interview?”I run, leaving the questions to fade in the sun rays and shadows behind me.I need to bring my sons here . . . and in less than two hours! How am I going to do that?My mind resumes its processes. A plan comes together in my thoughts. There is no time to lose. Now, actions are needed.I run to the main street where I will catch a taxi cab.When life gives you challenges, you have no choice—you have to fight, I tell myself.“Taxi!” I call. Now the soviet Jiguli speeds toward the Vake district. I dial my cell phone. My mother answers.“Mom, you need to bribe Sandro with any possible bribe so he gets dressed. I am coming to pick him up. I need to take the boys to the consulate for an interview, and we have very little time.”Mom assures me she will. In her voice I hear the same urgency that I feel. We both hang up. With the short call, I have stolen what time I am able.The first move has been made.Wanting to go to America, yet wanting to stay in my homeland, I look out the cab window and fill my eyes with Tbilisi.When I left to go to the consulate, few cars moved in the streets, as the city still lay asleep. Many jobs start around nine or ten each morning, reflecting Europe’s laidback lifestyle. Well-rested people have more energy to work, and most don’t spend so much money on possessions that they have to work more to pay for it all. They value simplicity of life, but also quality and artistry of effort that beautifies life.Five-floor condominium buildings in European architectural style are switching each other as the taxi passes them. Rows of huge plane trees line the way, interspersing my view. Detailed ornamental pieces on buildings, shops with wide gallery windows, sidewalks with wide tiles . . . many times these have been compared with the streets of Paris.Well-dressed people with business appearance stroll toward destinations. Most women wear dresses and high heels, and men wear dress pants and suit jackets.Georgian people have an old, rich culture of the arts and love to wear intellectual styles. It is in character to always look presentable, no matter our circumstances.Gray and dark colors of clothing dominate the streets. Is this a result of Georgia’s challenging years? I see seriousness and thoughtful eyes on people’s faces. They all have lot on their minds: “What shall I do? How might I improve living?”These are the worries they have been dealing with since the Soviet Union collapsed.Well, the university is right here—I just passed by. And there it is—the philharmonic concert hall! Outside it stands the famous bronze statue of Lady Muse, an affirmation of Georgia’s artistic soul.The car carries me forward, nearer to three visas to my beloved new foster country.But my thoughts carry me backward, to my childhood in my treasured homeland of Georgia, to one precious, unforgettable summer when I was twelve. Summers with my parents and older brother in Kvishkheti, a small village tucked among the high peaks of the Caucasus Mountains in east Georgia, have left an indelible imprint on my young imagination and thinking. It is not merely a village. It is a vacation house for writers and creative people, a place enveloped by beauty and fresh climate.Many well-known authors and artists, together with their families, spend summer vacations here. They produce new novels, poems, and works of art—inspiring and being inspired.The first time my parents brought me here, I was three years old. It has been part of my dad’s job, as an author with the Georgian Writer’s Union, to manage the Kvishkheti library and literary events for vacationers. In this wondrous place, my every July and August is filled with joy and carelessness. Every year the same families and children come and spend time here. It is like being in one big family that we see again every summer. Everyone knows each other, shares similar interests, and is connected.Originally this huge land and its buildings was the residence of a writer and public person who lived in the late nineteenth century.A large part of Kvishkheti is surrounded by a green steel-pole fence that is six feet tall. And the gate! It is the same green with a heavy metal door that has a small lock. One has to push down the handle, and you are in! The gate plays a pretty important role. It is a divider between “writers” and “non-writers,” as we call vacationers, based on where they stay—either inside the more than five acres of fence line, or outside of it, where vacationers rent houses from the locals. These “non-writers” are equally our dear friends, year after year.Inside the fence the main building, once the primary residence, now is for us to use. There are about fifty rooms. One room is given in rent to one family, so many families can visit here together. Bathrooms and showers are located in the lower level for shared use.On the main floor is a huge ballroom with a fireplace. In the center of one wall is a portrait of the writer who lived in this house. The ballroom also holds a large balcony with windows that overlook the grounds.From the balcony, a breathtaking view opens up. A wide valley with railroad tracks carries a train away to Batumi, a port on the Black Sea. A forest extends as far as eyes can see, and it is mixed—evergreen trees and trees with leaves. The forest covers mountains that form a big bowl around us.All this picturesque mountain scenery bridges eastern Georgia and western Georgia.The climate here is freshest, but it also has curative qualities. It cures lung disease, clears lungs, and makes lungs strong again.The property itself holds tall, century-old Tilia caucasica trees. They form a huge walkway, and green wooden park benches line the walkway’s edges, facing each other across the aisle, some with small tables beside them.These trees are an entertainment for us. They grow green seeds, which themselves hold black seeds inside. We pick the green seeds, open them up, and make black seed necklaces for ourselves. We use sewing thread and needle for this. The black seed is smaller than a sunflower seed, but we very patiently sit, make a hole with the needle, and one after another put seeds on the thread. Sometimes a finished necklace is so long that it reaches to a belly button. We compare and had fun. Who can count how many necklaces we children have made since we began coming here? The names of my girlfriends are Tamara, Eka, Sofio, Nino, Maia. The boys are Gio, Irakli, Sandro, Levan, David. . . .The benches have produced cherished memories as well. On every bench a writer sits and writes a poem, thinks about a novel, or worries about characters of a drama piece. Other people sit and draw still life art or paint portraits that museums will one day display, all while we children walk along and watch.Every afternoon my dad sits on one of the benches with his pen and notebook or with books he has brought along. He is constantly reading or writing.The summer I am twelve, my admiration of his gift stirs me to also become a writer.Everyone is inspired in this magical, creative place.This late nineteenth century writer’s residence is one of few such residences that survived the hands of the Communist Party. After Communist power spread in the early 1900s, according to their ideology, owners of larger properties or houses across Georgia were seized. Communist philosophy: Take away from the rich and give it to the poor! They evicted owners of big houses and land and lodged many poor families on each property.The destructive path of the Communists has been bloody. Their painful system and practices, which has ruled us for generations, has killed millions of innocent people and tortured the intelligent public into submission.By odds, however, this particular property in Kvishkheti was not divided between many different families. In favor of intelligentsia, it was transformed into a place where people now spend time creating, where they enrich their imaginations and souls by being closer to nature.No matter how many forbidden rules we face under Communism, we’ve had some great life experiences growing up, many of them in Kvishkheti. In the taxi, holding to the top of the front seat and still about four minutes from home, I reflect that we also experienced many difficult times over the years.As children, we were left without a choice. We had to become young communists.From age six to twelve, we were called Octobrist. The name came from the union, which was founded on October 17, 1905. Each of us wore a small medal with a portrait of a six-year-old curly-haired boy named Vladimir, who later was known as Lenin.Then we grew up a little and became Pioneers. To show our readiness to serve the party, we again wore a small medal with Lenin’s teenage face. We also wore red bandanas around our necks, stood straight up, and saluted to the regime.Every morning a leader of the Pioneers would ask us in a commanding tone, “Young communists, are you ready to serve the Communist Party?”“We are ready,” we had to answer, and no other answer was even considered.All of us hated this routine, the bandanas, and the whole concept itself. But who would even dare and show their true feelings?Then as teenagers we turned into Komsomols. The word was an abbreviation of the Russian phrase Kommunisticheskii Soyuz Molodyozhi, which itself stood for All-Union Leninist Young Communist League.Strict dress codes made all of this worse. Girls wore pleated, brown wool dresses, the same over and over every day. Nothing changed for ten years, only the size of the dress. Guys wore deep blue suits—almost dark gray—and white shirts, all the time. These ugly, boring uniforms induced negative feelings in us. We all looked and felt the same.The communists definitely blocked individualism in us. The colors of our thoughts were gray and brown, just like the outfits we wore.Growing up under communism, life itself had colorless colors.I wore ugly glasses, which was not a surprise. The Soviet Union had no style. Big, heavy frames almost covered my face, but still you were able to see the green eyes, which, over the years, received many compliments. My haircut was short, no particular style or shape. Nothing special.Memories of my school experience are pretty pale. Over the years I realized how communism did not develop personality qualities in us, nor did it flourish our interests. The soviet system did not encourage individualism as a concept.The school where I spent all eleven years of my education was prestigious in the city. The lady director, very tough and strict, eventually led the school to success. But we were victims of the soviet system. School reflected the system’s requirements. It locked our self-esteem. The “fair” outlined our views—everything was based on fair. That’s why no one loved to go to school. Every morning we would go because we had to.But the soviet educational system had a few good benefits. It provided a wide range of knowledge. We read and studied works of classic writers from all over the world.The history of the world was taught precisely, which gave us deep knowledge of other countries’ highlights.We learned geography, science, and foreign languages. The Russian language remained as the mandatory language in the entire Soviet Union’s school system. Together with the native language, we had to learn Russian from the first grade.Looking from the positive side, knowing Russian enabled us to read original writings of many great Russian authors.What we disliked was the history of the Soviet Union, which was based on lies but shown as the greatness of the party.They tried to engrave this false greatness in every child. Yes, we as children realized all these falsities, but who would disagree? We had to memorize lies and live life with them.In school, we knew we were taught lies. We didn’t like it. And inside of us we, children of the ’80s, protested. My generation, unlike my parents’ generation, was not that scared. We were quietly rebellious.Yet I saw firsthand the consequences of censure against free thinking. My brother, Levan, who always had some non-communist ideas, one day faced the pressure of system.It was the day his class had a class president’s election. Well, the word “election” was just a word, without actual meaning behind it.Forty-two classmates, boys and girls, all looked very neat on that day, all prepared for the big decision.At the head of the class, the teacher, Mrs. Lomidze, coldly announced, “Today we are going to choose your class president. Giorgi is nominated to be class president. We will ask you a question, and by raising your hand to agree or disagree, we will decide about Giorgi.”Students’ faces didn’t show much expression. Students did not think. They just followed whatever would be told.Satisfied, the teacher started the “voting” process. “Who agrees that Giorgi will be class president for this school year?”Everyone raised up a hand, without hesitation and without any reaction on their face.“Is anyone opposed to Giorgi’s candidature?” Mrs. Lomidze continued with mandatory responsibility. No one should have disagreed, and she didn’t expect that anyone would.But just as the teacher was going to announce the election’s results, my brother raised his hand.“Levan?” she asked. “What’s going on? Why are you raising your hand?”The teacher did not even connect the idea that someone would reject the nomination of the person she had decided.“I reject the candidature of Giorgi!” Levan’s voice was firm and clear.“You what? Reject?” Mrs. Lomidze’s voice carried irritation and anger that concerned the children.That day after the break, the principal’s assistant approached Levan. “You need to bring your parents tomorrow to school. It is the principal’s request!” My parents were very scared. “Levan, what are you doing to us?”My parents were summoned to the school in front of the principal and teachers. They were condemned for their son’s behavior.In class Levan’s inquisitive mind remained conflicted. He had difficulty with just following what he was told to think or to say without expressing his ideas or opinions.He wondered, “Why are people not allowed to have a different point of view?”My mom worried till the death, “Where is he getting all of these ‘free’ ideas?”One day I discovered the answer. While I was searching for some item in my parents’ closet, I came to a big, heavy sack. Naively I moved it closer and glanced inside. Magazines! Big Russian letters read, AMERICA.I slid my hand over a glossy cover. The pages were so smooth, so durable. Something mysteriously pulled me closer. My interest was triggered, and I started to flip the pages. Large, colorful pictures of American architecture. Skyscrapers. Jazz musicians. Articles about American culture, education. Christmas stories and traditions. Christmas songs and musical notes.It all unfolded in front of my eyes, leaving me in complete astonishment and excitement.That evening when Dad came home from work, I could not wait until he sat on the couch. Still in hallway, while he was unbuttoning his coat, I asked, “Dad, I found those magazines—America! Where are they from?”“All right, you know about them now,” he warned me quietly in the tone that meant I needed to listen, “but make sure you do not talk too much about them.”I agreed.Dad shared the secret, “Uncle Roman is receiving them at work. Even though soviets refer to the United States as its ‘capitalist enemy,’ still there is huge interest toward it. Officially these magazines are not permitted for society. They are only reachable by people in higher positions, such as members of the Communist Party. This, itself, is the irony of the system,” he commented, “showing that there are gaps between ideology and reality.”Lucky for us to have access to such information! We now knew what real life looked like in America, with its highs and lows. There were articles about many eye-opening elements of life in a free society. Soviets tried to prevent people from seeing colorful and pleasurable life images of the west. But as the saying goes, forbidden fruit tastes better.Influenced by those magazines, Levan implemented some brave ideas in the family. Once, when he was fourteen, he came up with an idea that left my parents confused and scared. “Mom, Dad, I will be making a turkey dinner, and we will celebrate the American tradition of Thanksgiving. I will stuff the turkey and cook it with a recipe from the magazine.” After our American Thanksgiving, Levan asked me if I would learn the notes and lyrics of “Holy Night.” Paradoxically, lyrics were translated into Russian. My open-minded character quickly supported Levan’s ideas. On our brown Belarus piano in the family room, the two of us tried to play and sing the Christmas songs. We celebrated Christmas on December 25 and played Christmas music.As a growing teenager, I loved American traditions.And I resented communist rule. The taxi arrives in the Vake neighborhood within fifteen minutes and stops.I feel sad that, unfortunately, some countries in this world are less powerful and less fortunate. A big role if they are to succeed and flourish is played by the geographical, political, and environmental conditions and their relationship with neighboring countries.At the same time, I feel happy that I discovered magazines in Dad and Mom’s closet. The photographs. The traditions. The culture of freedom. “Wait for me here,” I tell the driver. “It should not take too long. I need to bring my sons.”I rapidly squeeze myself out of the car and run toward my building. Thankfully, our condo is on the first floor.Mom stands by the window, watching for me.Right away she opens the door. . . .",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><b>A thing or two about the story<span><br/></span></b></h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Main character Salvatore has found a perfect formula for saving the most </span>threatened<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> wild animals on earth. Hidden in a pristine forest he and his team work very hard on this Ark of Noah 2.0. Salvatore knows: nothing matters anymore if biodiversity on our planet is gone. He also opposes against the secret Doomsday Scenario. Companies like Monsanto are shareholder in this Global Seed Vault on Spitsbergen (Norway). Salvatore speculates about their real motives. At the same time journalist Peter Willcox smells a great scoop when a brilliant scientist informs him about an upcoming New World Order. Is this another conspiracy </span>theory or is it<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> finally becoming fact? And how does genetic manipulation fit in to that? He’s astonished to discover that so far the media have not been able to tackle this world threatening issue. When, in the end, Willcox meets Salvatore fate decides on their future.</span>
<p>
</p>
<p>The scenes take place in New York and Amsterdam, but also in various places in the impenetrable jungle. Exiting twists and ditto cliffhangers make this book a pageturner.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>The book as an illustration of the real world<span><br/></span></b></h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Refugium illustrates what happens on a daily basis, how large corporations and corrupt politicians are trying to get complete control over mankind and the system. Some companies in the book are real. Other characters and organizations are invented just to serve the story.</span>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Finally<span><br/></span></b></h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I hope I was convincing (as English is not my native tongue) and thank you in advance for your time and support.</span>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;"">Iets over de inhoud van het boek</span><br/>
</div>
<p>Hoofdrolspeler Salvatore heeft voor het redden van alle belangrijke planten en dieren op aarde een perfecte formule gevonden. Hij verzet zich tegelijkertijd ook tegen het lang niet bij iedereen bekende <b>Doomsday-scenario</b>. Wie dat woord intikt op Google ontdekt dat onder andere <b>Monsanto</b> heeft geïnvesteerd in een zadenbank op Spitsbergen. Salvatore speculeert over de werkelijke motieven van dit bedrijf, aangezien Monsanto feitelijk massavernietigingswapens produceert in de vorm van de meest gruwelijke gifstoffen. Journalist Peter Willcox van de New York Times probeert zijn vinger achter alle feiten te krijgen die hem door een onbekende wetenschapper worden ingefluisterd. Hij valt daarbij van de ene verbazing in de andere en werkt ondertussen aan een schokkende wereldprimeur. Als hij tenslotte deze mysterieuze Salvatore ontmoet bepaalt het noodlot hoe de toekomst eruitziet...</p>
<p>De scènes spelen zich af in New York en Amsterdam, maar ook op verschillende plaatsen in de ongerepte jungle, waar de jacht op zeldzame soorten elke dag gewoon doorgaat.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3><b>Het boek als illustratie van de werkelijkheid</b></h3>
Het boek illustreert wat er dagelijks gebeurt, hoe grote bedrijven en corrupte politici al vele jaren proberen complete controle te krijgen over de mensheid en het systeem. Sommige bedrijven noem ik met naam en toenaam. De overige personages en organisaties zijn fictief en dienen het verhaal. <span><br/></span>De roman/thrillervorm gebruik ik bewust aangezien er al genoeg rapporten zijn over de toestand van de aarde, maar die worden door het grote publiek doorgaans niet gelezen of zijn te wetenschappelijk en daardoor ontoegankelijk. Via een spannend verhaal reist de essentie van die informatie veel gemakkelijker het bewustzijn in. Hopelijk kan zo de massa wakker geschud worden.<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b></b></span></p>
<h3><b>Meer details over mij als journalist</b></h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ik heb ruim twintig jaar bij kranten gewerkt als journalist en als teamchef van een eindredactie. Uiteindelijk heb ik gekozen voor een uitdaging als freelance journalist. Ik heb onder andere boeken geschreven voor Staatsbosbeheer, EcoMare Texel, de KNNV Uitgeverij en de gemeente Alkmaar. Tot grote tevredenheid van de opdrachtgevers. Daarnaast ben ik eindredacteur en hoofdredacteur (geweest) van verschillende uitgaven en boeken.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/>Inmiddels is – zoals wij allen weten – het medialandschap sterk veranderd. De commercie en de grote (technologie)bedrijven hebben de wereld in de houdgreep genomen. Voor kritische journalistiek en voor duiding is nagenoeg geen neutraal geld meer beschikbaar. Gelukkig zijn er nog altijd terriërs van journalisten die via andere wegen, zoals boeken, bewustzijn wekken. Zo heeft Joris Luyendijk geweldig werk verricht met zijn publicaties over de banken. Refugium is mijn bijdrage, vanuit mijn passie voor en kennis over de natuur. <span><br/></span>Er zijn veel problemen </span>in de wereld en het gaat steeds over mensen en hoe ze met elkaar omgaan. Wij zijn zo druk met onszelf en onze overheersing over elkaar bezig dat al het andere leven tussen die krachten wordt fijngemalen. Pure, wilde natuur zorgt voor onze hartslag en bloedsomloop. Dat mogen we onder geen enkele omstandigheid vergeten.</div><div>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 24px;""><span><br/></span>Recensies tot nu toe:<span><br/></span></b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><br/></span>Spannend, van het begin tot het eind<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Het boek Refugium van Johan Bos leest als een trein. Je wordt direct in het verhaal gezogen. Als je niet oppast wordt het een late avond, want je wilt het uitlezen! Het boek laat als geen ander zien hoe de wereld er momenteel voorstaat wat betreft de natuur op deze planeet en de duistere ontwikkelingen in de wereld van de genetische manipulatie.</span>
</div><div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Na het lezen dacht ik dat dit verhaal ook een prachtige speelfilm zou kunnen worden om de mensen eens goed wakker te schudden over waarmee die grote genbedrijven allemaal bezig zijn. Ze spelen met bouwstenen van de natuur, waarvan ze denken verstand te hebben, maar ze weten absoluut niet waarmee ze bezig zijn.<span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ik zou dit boek graag aanbevelen, en niet alleen aan mensen die zich voor dit thema interesseren, maar aan iedereen die een spannend boek wil lezen.<span><br/></span></span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Jeroen<span><br/></span></i></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">---------</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Na de start wilde ik meteen weten hoe het afliep. Zeer vlot geschreven.

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">""Als alle rede is vergaan, heiligt slechts het doel dan de middelen?""<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Johan Bos geeft met Refugium een indringend statement af, als briljante romanschrijver en als pleitbezorger voor de ontredderde staat van onze planeet en haar supportsystemen. Op slimme en verrassende wijze bouwt hij een relevante en actuele eko-crimi, met als fundament een ingenieus fantasy-verhaal dat leest als een trein en je na de laatste pagina nog dagen lang in een onheilspellende greep houdt. Prachtige natuurobservaties, springlevende karakters die intensief je hoofd gaan bevolken, spetterende internationale actie en bloedstollende twists, kortom een razendsnelle maaltijd om je dwangmatig bladerende vingers uiterst nerveus bij af te likken. Zorgvuldig word je als lezer meegezogen in een waarlijk filmisch epos, fantastisch fictief maar tegelijkertijd tergend plausibel. Afgezet tegen een bloedstollende achtergrond van politieke en ecologische realiteit legt Bos op spannende, vlijmscherpe en vooral ook humoristische wijze de vinger op de zere plek, daarbij gretig schrapend aan zowel sluimerend als ontwaakt moreel-ethisch bewustzijn. Hij schroomt dan ook niet om vooral man en paard te noemen, speciaal daar waar het gaat om inmiddels welbekende, destabiliserende machiavellistische (f)actoren in onze sociale en natuurlijke omgeving. De perverse symbiose tussen politiek, industrie, monetaire macht en het alles omvattende waanidee van wereldwijde beheersbaarheid wordt blootgelegd in al zijn desastreuze consequenties. Als antithese pareert Johan Bos deze doorgedraaide zelfwaan op grootse wijze met de ontzagwekkende oerkracht van de natuur, een onvoorspelbaar spel van krachten en invloeden dat ons zou moeten doen buigen, in respect, nederigheid en dienstbaarheid. Want ook al is onze Natuur een onvoorwaardelijk liefhebbende Moeder, ze is tegelijkertijd een heel strenge. <span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Bos serveert de lezer een totaalmenu, in verschillende rijk geschakeerde gangen, verbazingwekkend qua ingrediënten, compositie en textuur. <span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Refugium is een echte lekkernij, ademt diepe spanning en urgentie, is een page turner eerste klas, en drukt je, mede door een kraker van een ontknoping, op niet mis verstane wijze met je neus op een ontluisterende holistische realiteit. Wakker worden! Het gebeurt hier, en nu!

Het bizarre feit is dat het verhaal helaas ook werkelijkheid is… <span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Johan Bos snijdt een zeer belangrijk onderwerp aan; duistere en realistische ontwikkelingen die in de wereld gaande zijn… We hebben er allemaal mee te maken, maar wie is zich er daadwerkelijk van bewust?

That, in my opinion, is the best medicine against the headache our planet gets from us humans. Dutch supporters can get the book as an epub or paperback by sponsering through one of the perks.English supporters, for now, can help me by chipping in a minimum of € 15,00. When I reach my goal I’ll send you the epub as soon as the translation is finished. If you like my effort and want to support my work as independent journalist you can become a sympathizer too. You'll find options at the perks.When I receive more money than I need for the translation into English I will use it to prepare a translation into Spanish.



A thing or two about the story
Main character Salvatore has found a perfect formula for saving the most threatened wild animals on earth. Hidden in a pristine forest he and his team work very hard on this Ark of Noah 2.0. Salvatore knows: nothing matters anymore if biodiversity on our planet is gone. He also opposes against the secret Doomsday Scenario. Companies like Monsanto are shareholder in this Global Seed Vault on Spitsbergen (Norway). Salvatore speculates about their real motives. At the same time journalist Peter Willcox smells a great scoop when a brilliant scientist informs him about an upcoming New World Order. Is this another conspiracy theory or is it finally becoming fact? And how does genetic manipulation fit in to that? He’s astonished to discover that so far the media have not been able to tackle this world threatening issue. When, in the end, Willcox meets Salvatore fate decides on their future.


The scenes take place in New York and Amsterdam, but also in various places in the impenetrable jungle. Exiting twists and ditto cliffhangers make this book a pageturner.



The book as an illustration of the real world
Refugium illustrates what happens on a daily basis, how large corporations and corrupt politicians are trying to get complete control over mankind and the system. Some companies in the book are real. Other characters and organizations are invented just to serve the story.



Finally
I hope I was convincing (as English is not my native tongue) and thank you in advance for your time and support.

Dutch version. In het Nederlands:
De Aarde is dood... wie vertelt het de kinderen?

Hoe geven we de aarde straks door aan de volgende generatie? Wie gaat in de toekomst aan alle onschuldige kinderen uitleggen dat de olifanten, neushoorns, leeuwen, tijgers en walvissen zijn uitgestorven?

Even voorstellen: mijn naam is Johan Bos en ik ben werkzaam als journalist/auteur.Mijn boek Refugium wakkert via een intrigerend verhaal en een heldere logica bewustzijn aan over ons gedrag als soort. De impact van de mens is heel groot. We pakken Moeder Aarde haar schoonheid af en geven er afval, gif en broeikasgassen voor terug. Dat is vals spelen. Diep van binnen weten we het, maar we zijn zo druk... Heb je een sluimerend gevoel dat je iets moet doen? Ik heb dat al een hele tijd. Vandaar mijn boek en deze campagne.

Geen risico
Aan dit project kleeft geen enkel risico voor jou als Nederlandstalige sponsor, want het boek is klaar. Als sponsor krijg je altijd je product (epub of paperback).

'Waarom dan toch crowdfunding?' Een terechte vraag.Het gestelde crowdfunding-bedrag is nodig om een vertaling naar het Engels mogelijk te maken, inclusief bijkomende kosten. Als we de wereld willen veranderen, dan is een vertaling onontbeerlijk. Aantallen maken immers het verschil. Laten wij samen onze vinger in deze lekkende dijk steken. Wachten op de politiek is zinloos. 


Doe het iemand cadeau
Je kunt het boek natuurlijk ook als cadeautje aan iemand anders geven, om zo mee te helpen bewustzijn te genereren. Of je bestelt meerdere exemplaren en stuurt ze naar de gedrukte pers en andere media. Als genoeg mensen dat doen dan zal dit onderwerp uiteindelijk echt niet meer genegeerd kunnen worden. En dat is het doel. Bij de 'perks' zie je ook andere mogelijkheden om mij te steunen en daarmee steun je ook jezelf en alle toekomstige generaties. Het is een investering in de toekomst! Onze toekomst.

Iets over de inhoud van het boek

Hoofdrolspeler Salvatore heeft voor het redden van alle belangrijke planten en dieren op aarde een perfecte formule gevonden. Hij verzet zich tegelijkertijd ook tegen het lang niet bij iedereen bekende Doomsday-scenario. Wie dat woord intikt op Google ontdekt dat onder andere Monsanto heeft geïnvesteerd in een zadenbank op Spitsbergen. Salvatore speculeert over de werkelijke motieven van dit bedrijf, aangezien Monsanto feitelijk massavernietigingswapens produceert in de vorm van de meest gruwelijke gifstoffen. Journalist Peter Willcox van de New York Times probeert zijn vinger achter alle feiten te krijgen die hem door een onbekende wetenschapper worden ingefluisterd. Hij valt daarbij van de ene verbazing in de andere en werkt ondertussen aan een schokkende wereldprimeur. Als hij tenslotte deze mysterieuze Salvatore ontmoet bepaalt het noodlot hoe de toekomst eruitziet...
De scènes spelen zich af in New York en Amsterdam, maar ook op verschillende plaatsen in de ongerepte jungle, waar de jacht op zeldzame soorten elke dag gewoon doorgaat.

Het boek als illustratie van de werkelijkheid
Het boek illustreert wat er dagelijks gebeurt, hoe grote bedrijven en corrupte politici al vele jaren proberen complete controle te krijgen over de mensheid en het systeem. Sommige bedrijven noem ik met naam en toenaam. De overige personages en organisaties zijn fictief en dienen het verhaal. De roman/thrillervorm gebruik ik bewust aangezien er al genoeg rapporten zijn over de toestand van de aarde, maar die worden door het grote publiek doorgaans niet gelezen of zijn te wetenschappelijk en daardoor ontoegankelijk. Via een spannend verhaal reist de essentie van die informatie veel gemakkelijker het bewustzijn in. Hopelijk kan zo de massa wakker geschud worden.

Meer details over mij als journalist
Ik heb ruim twintig jaar bij kranten gewerkt als journalist en als teamchef van een eindredactie. Uiteindelijk heb ik gekozen voor een uitdaging als freelance journalist. Ik heb onder andere boeken geschreven voor Staatsbosbeheer, EcoMare Texel, de KNNV Uitgeverij en de gemeente Alkmaar. Tot grote tevredenheid van de opdrachtgevers. Daarnaast ben ik eindredacteur en hoofdredacteur (geweest) van verschillende uitgaven en boeken.Inmiddels is – zoals wij allen weten – het medialandschap sterk veranderd. De commercie en de grote (technologie)bedrijven hebben de wereld in de houdgreep genomen. Voor kritische journalistiek en voor duiding is nagenoeg geen neutraal geld meer beschikbaar. Gelukkig zijn er nog altijd terriërs van journalisten die via andere wegen, zoals boeken, bewustzijn wekken. Zo heeft Joris Luyendijk geweldig werk verricht met zijn publicaties over de banken. Refugium is mijn bijdrage, vanuit mijn passie voor en kennis over de natuur. Er zijn veel problemen in de wereld en het gaat steeds over mensen en hoe ze met elkaar omgaan. Wij zijn zo druk met onszelf en onze overheersing over elkaar bezig dat al het andere leven tussen die krachten wordt fijngemalen. Pure, wilde natuur zorgt voor onze hartslag en bloedsomloop. Dat mogen we onder geen enkele omstandigheid vergeten.
Recensies tot nu toe:Spannend, van het begin tot het eindHet boek Refugium van Johan Bos leest als een trein. Je wordt direct in het verhaal gezogen. Als je niet oppast wordt het een late avond, want je wilt het uitlezen! Het boek laat als geen ander zien hoe de wereld er momenteel voorstaat wat betreft de natuur op deze planeet en de duistere ontwikkelingen in de wereld van de genetische manipulatie.

Na het lezen dacht ik dat dit verhaal ook een prachtige speelfilm zou kunnen worden om de mensen eens goed wakker te schudden over waarmee die grote genbedrijven allemaal bezig zijn. Ze spelen met bouwstenen van de natuur, waarvan ze denken verstand te hebben, maar ze weten absoluut niet waarmee ze bezig zijn.Ik zou dit boek graag aanbevelen, en niet alleen aan mensen die zich voor dit thema interesseren, maar aan iedereen die een spannend boek wil lezen.Jeroen---------
Na de start wilde ik meteen weten hoe het afliep. Zeer vlot geschreven. Ik moet qua wendingen en plot aan Dan Brown denken, maar dan over een heel ander onderwerp.Roland---------
""Als alle rede is vergaan, heiligt slechts het doel dan de middelen?""Johan Bos geeft met Refugium een indringend statement af, als briljante romanschrijver en als pleitbezorger voor de ontredderde staat van onze planeet en haar supportsystemen. Op slimme en verrassende wijze bouwt hij een relevante en actuele eko-crimi, met als fundament een ingenieus fantasy-verhaal dat leest als een trein en je na de laatste pagina nog dagen lang in een onheilspellende greep houdt. Prachtige natuurobservaties, springlevende karakters die intensief je hoofd gaan bevolken, spetterende internationale actie en bloedstollende twists, kortom een razendsnelle maaltijd om je dwangmatig bladerende vingers uiterst nerveus bij af te likken. Zorgvuldig word je als lezer meegezogen in een waarlijk filmisch epos, fantastisch fictief maar tegelijkertijd tergend plausibel. Afgezet tegen een bloedstollende achtergrond van politieke en ecologische realiteit legt Bos op spannende, vlijmscherpe en vooral ook humoristische wijze de vinger op de zere plek, daarbij gretig schrapend aan zowel sluimerend als ontwaakt moreel-ethisch bewustzijn. Hij schroomt dan ook niet om vooral man en paard te noemen, speciaal daar waar het gaat om inmiddels welbekende, destabiliserende machiavellistische (f)actoren in onze sociale en natuurlijke omgeving. De perverse symbiose tussen politiek, industrie, monetaire macht en het alles omvattende waanidee van wereldwijde beheersbaarheid wordt blootgelegd in al zijn desastreuze consequenties. Als antithese pareert Johan Bos deze doorgedraaide zelfwaan op grootse wijze met de ontzagwekkende oerkracht van de natuur, een onvoorspelbaar spel van krachten en invloeden dat ons zou moeten doen buigen, in respect, nederigheid en dienstbaarheid. Want ook al is onze Natuur een onvoorwaardelijk liefhebbende Moeder, ze is tegelijkertijd een heel strenge. Bos serveert de lezer een totaalmenu, in verschillende rijk geschakeerde gangen, verbazingwekkend qua ingrediënten, compositie en textuur. Refugium is een echte lekkernij, ademt diepe spanning en urgentie, is een page turner eerste klas, en drukt je, mede door een kraker van een ontknoping, op niet mis verstane wijze met je neus op een ontluisterende holistische realiteit. Wakker worden! Het gebeurt hier, en nu! No Time To Waste!Oscar--------


VerslaafdKleine update. Ondertussen redelijk verslaafd en met angst en beven zie ik station Utrecht alweer naderen. Op dit moment denk ik strik erom en boekenweekgeschenk.Jan-----
Spannend en goed geschreven.Nadja--------
Een mustDoor een keten van stemmingen ben ik heengegaan bij het lezen van Refugium. Het gevoel dat ik echt in 'de juiste film' zat, tot aan bijna het einde van het boek... De laatste stemming zit me nog steeds het meeste dwars, geen happy ending namelijk... Maar misschien is dit wel precies wat de schrijver beoogt met dit boek? Het weergeven van de kneiterharde werkelijkheid in de huidige wereld. Het blijven aansporen tot nog meer bewustzijn en vooral tot nog meer actie om jouw eigen bijdrage te leveren aan een betere wereld. Dit is in ieder geval wat het mij heeft gedaan.De karakters, de details, de opbouw, op het verkeerde been gezet worden, de spanning, dit alles maakte dat ik het boek eigenlijk geen seconde wilde neerleggen. Schrijver Bos heeft een boodschap te brengen. Hopelijk zullen er nog vele boeken van zijn hand volgen.Dorien---------
Levendige bewustwording! Echt een aanrader!Veel zinnige informatie wordt in een hoog tempo doorgegeven. Je blijft geboeid doorlezen... Neem alle tijd voor dit bijzondere boek, stoppen met lezen gaat je niet lukken :-) Echt een aanrader voor alle Bourgondiërs en natuurliefhebbers, eigenlijk voor iedereen een must!Josta--------
Een eye openerEen boek wat je aan het denken zet, en toch makkelijk leest… Waarbij je wegdroomt bij de prachtige natuurbeelden die beschreven worden… Een boek met humor en veel ruimte voor eigen interpretatie. Zo’n boek waar je het gevoel hebt dat je in twee werelden tegelijk leeft, de werkelijkheid en het verhaal. Het bizarre feit is dat het verhaal helaas ook werkelijkheid is… Johan Bos snijdt een zeer belangrijk onderwerp aan; duistere en realistische ontwikkelingen die in de wereld gaande zijn… We hebben er allemaal mee te maken, maar wie is zich er daadwerkelijk van bewust? We raken steeds meer vervreemd als natuurlijk wezen en raken verstrengeld in een maatschappij die enkel gericht is op het machtiger en rijker worden van een selecte groep mensen. We werken er allemaal aan mee, hoe kun je ook anders… Is ons water nog wel veilig? En ons eten? Kunnen we de lucht veilig inademen? Hebben we nog privacy of worden we allemaal onbewust in de gaten gehouden en via sluwe technieken gemanipuleerd? In een ontzettend spannend en meeslepend verhaal wordt er dieper ingegaan op de wereld van genetische manipulatie. Een must voor iedereen die wakker wil zijn, wil weten wat er écht aan de hand is! Al kun je het niet direct veranderen, ‘leef zo puur, realistisch en bewust mogelijk’… Wat is logisch? Ga te rade bij je diepe oerverstand en doe niet mee aan deze verschrikkelijke mallemolen. Dat is een waardevolle boodschap die ik uit het boek heb gehaald. Een eye-opener…
Pluspunten: Fantasierijk, goed plot, meeslepend verhaal, spannendMowDee------------

</p><p>** THIS CAMPAIGN HAS COME TO AN END BUT THERE'LL BE ANOTHER FUNDING ROUND IN THE SPRING - SEE UPDATES AND THE FACEBOOK PAGE FOR MORE INFORMATION.  MANY THANKS FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT ** <br/></p><p>I’m a writer and traditional musician living in Sussex with a background in
environmental campaigning, environmental education and archaeological
interpretation and reconstruction.  Currently, I’m trying to raise some
cash to fund a new edition of my book, ‘Nine Miles: Two Winters of Anti-Road
Protest’.  As the title suggests, the book helps describe, from a personal
viewpoint, the anti-road protests in Britain
in the nineteen nineties, chiefly the campaign against the Newbury Bypass on
Berkshire/Hampshire county line.  </p>
<p>That’s a familiar story for many, but it’s easy to forget that others may
never have been aware of or know very little about those times.  Thousands
of people were involved, occupying trees and dealing with the cold and stress
of confrontations with security and evictions, but also remaining deeply rooted
to the land, even as we watched so much of it being taken away.</p>
<p>It’s a huge part of our social history and - with a massive road-building
programme once again underway - it remains as pertinent as ever.  But it
contains another story than simply another confrontation with the state; how it
can be when people try and live lightly for instance, what can occur when we
step away from the suburbs and cities, how it feels to find a sense of
belonging amid a world that can often feel so isolating and remote.</p>
<p>CATALYSTS</p>
<p>‘Nine Miles’ is just one memento of all this.  It was a time of
resistance, but also a cultural flowering; free parties, squats and wild
living, traditional music played under the trees, remembering and telling old
stories. It was about reclaiming the right to live on the land and stood as a
clarion call for the future.  Today, with the consequences of having had
our collective heads in the sand for so long being only too clear, voices of
what real cultural catalysts can look and feel like are probably as important
as ever.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s the greatest lesson of those times; how things can be when
people come together to act on their best intuitions; motivated by the deep
need for a sense of a shift.  That may or not may not be allied to protest
– and for my part, from necessity’s sake, protest is a thing from my
past.  But for a sense of the pace of the wider change needed, the story
of Newbury retains a great force.</p>
<p>THE BONES OF IT</p>
<p>This is an open ended project – those contributing receive a copy of the
book at market prices; that’s £10 plus postage and packing.  Raising over
£1000 ensures a small scale print run with Print On Demand technology that will
enable the book to remain funded for future print runs so long as people want
to buy it.  Over £5000 ensures a print run at cost price with a
top-of-the-range printers run as a workers’ co-op.  </p>
<p>For those who own a copy of the book already or who would like to contribute
something extra, I’ll be printing another run of our book of poetry, ‘Heartfires’
with poems from River Jones and beautiful woodcut illustrations by Rebecca
Tann.  And for the first 100 takers I’ll throw in a copy of either one of
my other poetry books – ‘Throwing Lights’ with Laura Joy and Oliver Tate or a
copy of my cartoon booklet ‘Wu, the Taoist with the Broken Arm’.  Any
extra proceeds will go into the project, helping fund cheaper print runs and in
the event of not reaching £1000, all contributions will be refunded.</p>
<p>REMEMBERING </p>
<p>By supporting this print run you’ll have in your hands a record of a truly
inspiring episode in our more recent history, and you’ll be helping keep alive
too the memory of what can take place when people come together to act on
behalf of both our immediate surroundings and wider world itself.  This
will be the third edition of Nine Miles since it was first published in 2006;
small-scale print runs that sold well and were received warmly – for reviews
and more information, see <a href=""http://ninemiles.co.uk/#/reviews/4526235905"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://ninemiles.org/#/reviews/4526235905"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the main nine miles site</a>.  </p>
<p>Nine Miles is a book that unavoidably deals with the politics of
protest.  There are many people who were involved at the time for whom a
return to that kind of action is no longer an option, just as there are many
more that have since chosen apparently less immediate, though no less current,
ways of making a difference.  People put a great deal on the line during
those protests and the experience of confrontation was often a defining aspect
of the time.  It remains my great hope that if we could remember with
greater vividness what happened all those years ago it would make a rerun all
the less necessary.  But when the need for action is there Newbury and other
campaigns stand as a reminder of what that action can look like.  To the
ten thousand trees then and the thousands of people involved, this is my
tribute; I hope it proves a fitting one for a time of such dedication and
passion.</p>

<strong><u> Contenido en español disponible abajo.</u></strong><h3>History </h3>
<p>While this story started a long time ago, it happened all because of a study abroad scholarship I received through the University of Michigan School of Social Work to do an oral history project in Guatemala with communities I have worked with in the past. </p>
<p>At La Escuela de la Montana (The Mountain School) where I learned Spanish, community leaders often come to speak with foreign students to give talks about their community's struggle on plantations to demand their worker's rights, their subsequent displacement and their struggle of starting over in a new land. However, I learned while doing these oral histories with community members that the children and youth here do not fully know their own community history.</p>
<p>As these communities are two or more generations beyond the struggle they had on the coffee plantations where they all were born and raised and worked, I felt important to find a way to give back. In collaboration with a young man from the community who is a brilliant artist, we embarked on this journey of bringing the community's history to life into this book. </p>
<p>Named <em><strong>Confía en la Lucha</strong></em>, the young adult book follows a young girl named Ceiba as she grows up on a finca (plantation) as she watches her father organize the workers into a union to demand their back pay. Later, when Ceiba is 15 years old, she joins the struggle and helps the workers find land. And from there it follows the history of the community. </p>
<p>Written based on oral histories, edited by Spanish language teachers and read and revised by multiple young people in Guatemala, this has truly been a collaborative effort. And it is ready to come to life.  </p>
</div><div> <h3>What We Need: </h3>
<p>We are now finishing up the edits, putting the final touches on the illustrations and are preparing to publish. Here's where we need your help. </p>
<p>I have contacted several printers and spoken with my uncle who has his own printing company. In short, self-publishing is expensive. </p>
<p>                 For 100 books the cost is $1,113. The expensive part is the set up to print. <br/>                 <strong>After that, copies are actually rather cheap: about $1.21 for each book. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We would like to publish 500 books so that each family can have a copy and the same for every young adult</strong> who receives a scholarship for secondary education provided by La Escuela de la Montana. Printing this quantity of books will provide copies to scholarship recipients for the next 3 years. </p>
<p>To print 500 books, the cost is $1600. We are asking for $2150 to cover costs of shipping and tariffs, which quickly add another $500.</p>
<p>We invite you to be part of this community oral history book project! There are three (3) levels of giving:</p>
<p>1).  $1 - $25 = Every $1.21 donated = one (1) book provided to scholarship students*</p>
<p>2). $26 - $75 = Provides 21 - 61 books to scholarship recipients* and donors will be provided with an English and/or Spanish eBook version of your choice.</p>
<p>3).  $76 + = Provides 62 to innumerable books to scholarship recipients*, access to English and/or Spanish eBook version of your choice and your own copy of the book**.</p>
<p>*-Cost of each copy of book after set up costs is $1.21. Set up costs run about $1100. </p>
<p>**-As we are printing copies locally and providing them to local communities in Guatemala, books will be in Spanish. There is a limit of 40 donors receiving their own copy of the book. All donors above $26 will receive an eBook version (English and/or Spanish will be available).</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I cannot begin to describe to you the impact this project has had on my life. It truly has been a privilege to be in Guatemala working with such wonderful people. </p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that it is rare for children to have access to books here in Guatemala, particularly in their own home. The Mountain School provides a community library where children often come after school to read. However, it only open during certain hours. One community leader, Ruben, said it best:</p>
<p><strong>""I could read the book in the community library when I could find time to go. But it would be really, really nice to have a copy for my family. I have given lots of interviews to former students and have presented my story often to the school, but I have never seen a product or a result of them. I am really looking forward to reading the story and sharing it with my children.""</strong></p>
<p>Through La Escuela de la Montana, young adults receive scholarships to attend secondary school. The recipients already meet monthly to discuss themes such as gang violence, sex education, how to apply to college and Guatemalan history. Many of those who have given talks to the youth have commented how this book can help them develop a more succinct curriculum based on their own community's history. </p>
<p>This is, perhaps, one of the first times this community's history has been recorded and printed. Not only does the book present the community's history, it discusses the value of collective action, activism, unions and how important community unity has been in fighting unfair wages, oppression, starvation and helped them survive and overcome. Moreover, it presents issues that young adults face today. </p>
<p>Imagine the potential:</p>
<p>               -80 families each have a copy of the book.</p>
<p>               -Between 80-100 scholarship recipients will receive their own copy of the <br/>                book for the next 3 years. </p>
<p>               -More than 50 Spanish language teachers will have access to the book (in <br/>               the school's library) to teach more of Guatemalan history. </p>
<p>               -A young adult curriculum can be developed around issues facing youth <br/>               today (i.e. gang violence, displacement, migration, unemployment and <br/>               poverty) while emphasizing collective action, community unity, and <br/>               cultivating what is called the Guatemalan Dream </p>
<p>               -Hundreds of people will learn a facet of Guatemalan history that is <br/>               unknown to most and from the perspective of the community.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><h3>Risks and Challenges</h3><div>We have decided to use Indiegogo's Flexible Fundraising option so that no matter what we will see this project through with whatever funding we have. We will face some limitations if more than 40 individuals wish to have a hard copy of the book. </div><div>When we began this project, printing copies this book was the first goal. As we dove further in, others became interested in purchasing copies. Now we have the opportunity to meet both needs.   </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways to Help:</h3>

</div></div>","Resumen
Imperfectu es una plataforma donde el cine, la academia, el arte y el activismo se combinan para crear un festival que explora temáticas relacionadas al cuerpo, la sexualidad y el género.
Somos el primer y único festival de cine y estudios de género en el noroeste de México. Hasta la fecha, hemos realizado dos ediciones en la ciudad de Tijuana, México: la primera en abril 2014 y la más reciente en julio de 2015.
Imperfectu cuenta con un equipo extenso que ha ayudado a realizar las dos ediciones del festival. Somos un cuerpo multidisciplinario que lucha por mantener el proyecto en pie, nuestro esfuerzo ha dado grandes frutos y es por ello que deseamos seguir innovando, de forma creativa y comprometida con la diversidad, las muchas formas de hacer arte en Tijuana y el resto de México.

 
Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes
Queremos reunir 6 mil USD para cerrar nuestra edición 2016 y desarrollar IMPERFECTU APP, un directorio digital que permitirá a tijuanenses y turistas en Tijuana hallar lugares y eventos incluyentes y libres de discriminación sexual, física, afectiva o racial. Con esta aplicación podrán calificar y consultar recomendaciones sobre restaurantes, cafés, asociaciones, instituciones, clubes, festivales, y demás.
Desde su nacimiento, Imperfectu ha contado con el apoyo de diversas instituciones y marcas, tanto locales como nacionales. Sin embargo, detrás de las ideas, la programación, la logística, el diseño, la comunicación, la publicidad, la promoción, la imagen y la administración, hay un incansable equipo que ha trabajado siempre con recursos propios, movido por el amor que le tiene a este proyecto.
Actualmente Imperfectu, un festival independiente, lucha por mantenerse activo para sus siguientes ediciones. Para ello, planea desarrollar IMPERFECTU APP, como un nuevo modelo de recaudación de fondos, el cual le permitirá contar con recursos de una forma más estable. Estos fondos vendrán de las cuotas fijadas mensualmente a los establecimientos y eventos que busquen comprometerse con el respeto de los derechos de las comunidades LGBTTIQ, y deseen formar parte del directorio.

Una vez alcanzada la meta, te agradeceremos mediante nuestras redes sociales y nuestra página web o bien te haremos llegar una serie de recompensas, como calcomanías, libros conmemorativos del festival y camisetas. ¡O incluso podrás cenar con unx de nuestrxs invitadxs durante la edición 4 del Festival en 2017!
 
El impacto
Esta aplicación permitirá que la comunidad LGBTTTIQ en Tijuana, y de otras partes del mundo, tenga mayor seguridad y libertad de expresión en una ciudad que despunta como amigable a la diversidad.
Gracias a IMPERFECTU APP muchos establecimientos aparecerán en una plataforma que proporcionará información bilingüe a sus clientes, así como la posibilidad de hacer pedidos en línea o comprar boletos: todo en una sola aplicación.
Por otro lado, la aplicación busca impulsar una imagen más real de Tijuana, visibilizando y ampliando los espacios libres de discriminación que ya existen en la ciudad, y a su vez generar la apertura de nuevos puntos que respeten las diversidades.   
Riesgos y desafíos
Si no recaudamos los fondos necesarios para el desarrollo de la aplicación, la posibilidad de ofrecer un directorio recreativo basado en la inclusión y el respeto de los derechos LGBTTTIQ en Tijuana se vería tristemente estancada. Asimismo, no obtendríamos ingresos para continuar con un festival que ha sido icónico en el noroeste de México. 
Por ello, tu ayuda es indispensable, ya que conocemos y sentimos la enorme importancia de este gran proyecto que desmitifica el sistema binario de género basado en la heteronormatividad. La idea es que la comunidad se una a nosotros y así continuemos fortaleciendo una sociedad tijuanense mucho más homologada en la aceptación y el respeto.

<li>Later publication. Reaching the goal will enable Menno to focus full time on finishing the book. If the goal is not met, this may mean having to combine the book with another job, which will likely lead to a later publication date.</li>
<li>No professional editor. A significant portion of the funds are designated for a professional editor. Of course we want the book to be of the highest quality, but if we do not reach the goal, this may be an area for cost savings.</li>

Unfortunately, shipping books out of Cambodia is a very costly and uncertain affair. To keep down costs and make sure you will actually receive the book in 2017, we decided to opt for shipping them straight from the printer.</p><p><strong>Who will the 5% go to?</strong></p><p>5% of the proceeds of the book (not just in the campaign, but for all future copies sold) will go to support young female leadership in Cambodia and elsewhere in Asia, through selected partner organizations. Partner selection is still in the works, so keep an eye on this page and the <a href=""http://www.divingdeepgoingfar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> for more details coming up.

The dinner and meet & greet can be scheduled at any time during 2017.What happens if the goal is not met?This is a campaign with flexible funding, which means that even if the $10,000 goal is not met, your contribution will still count. Depending on how close we do get to the goal, some scenarios are:
Later publication. Reaching the goal will enable Menno to focus full time on finishing the book. If the goal is not met, this may mean having to combine the book with another job, which will likely lead to a later publication date.
No professional editor. A significant portion of the funds are designated for a professional editor. Of course we want the book to be of the highest quality, but if we do not reach the goal, this may be an area for cost savings.
In any case, we will continue to provide you with updates after the campaign ends, to let you know how exactly the funds raised are being used and what final publication date you can expect.No signed copies?We realize that it is customary to offer signed copies of books in campaigns like these. Unfortunately, shipping books out of Cambodia is a very costly and uncertain affair. To keep down costs and make sure you will actually receive the book in 2017, we decided to opt for shipping them straight from the printer.Who will the 5% go to?5% of the proceeds of the book (not just in the campaign, but for all future copies sold) will go to support young female leadership in Cambodia and elsewhere in Asia, through selected partner organizations. Partner selection is still in the works, so keep an eye on this page and the website for more details coming up. After the publication date, the website will feature an ongoing report of how much support has been given to which exact organizations. More about Lotus Silk",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p><i>“The stories people tell have a way of taking care of them. If stories come to you, care for them. And learn to give them away where they are needed. Sometimes a person needs a story more than food to stay alive. That is why we put these stories in each other's memories. This is how people care for themselves.” </i></p>

<p>I have asked myself this question. “How can I use my position, knowledge of publishing, writing, editing, and sharing stories to help create additional contributions to the literary world that is diverse, equitable, and doesn’t just represent the same segment of society it always has since its inception?

It is a demand for a creative inter-subjective formation in which the ‘other’ becomes a mirror (but only a mirror) for my subjectivity. This idealism suggests to us that humanity is not embedded in my person solely as an individual; my humanity is co-substantively bestowed upon the other and me. Humanity is a quality we owe to each other. We create each other and need to sustain this otherness creation. And if we belong to each other, we participate in our creations: we are because you are, and since you are, I am. The ‘I am’ is not a rigid subject, but a dynamic self-constitution dependent on this otherness creation of relation and distance”.</p>

“The stories people tell have a way of taking care of them. If stories come to you, care for them. And learn to give them away where they are needed. Sometimes a person needs a story more than food to stay alive. That is why we put these stories in each other's memories. This is how people care for themselves.”

<h3>LØPE MAGAZINE</h3>
<p>The premise of Løpe Magazine simple: Each month, we will publish one eye-opening feature story (longform for those who like the word). For $20 per year, subscribers will have access to 12 in-depth stories per year. </p>
<p>Liam Boylan-Pett, a sub-four-minute miler turned writer and editor, is the magazine's founder. He will write and/or edit every story that goes on the site.

<p>Løpe Magazine launched in mid-June with the release of ""The History of the United States According to the Steeplechase,"" and will be resuming in earnest in September with a story from one of the world's most famous one-mile road races. In the time between, we're asking for your help: The more subscribers, the more content we will be able to produce.

<li>If you contribute through this IndieGoGo, you'll have an opportunity to pick up Løpe Magazine merchandise, including singlets, mugs, and laptop stickers. Plus, the more contributors, the more opportunities for more in-depth stories and more coverage of track and field. </li>

Our first walk was a funny encounter of us trying to observe each other, but there was an instant connection. Since that day, we’ve had so many great adventures.</p><p>Because I am “that” dog lady, I used my love for baking to spoil Maeby on her birthdays and gotcha days. It’s been a 7 year tradition of baking some seriously special treats that she and I have both enjoyed. And last year, I realized I had enough recipes to write a book, so here we are!</p><p>You’ll hopefully notice from our photos and the bakes themselves that spending time in the kitchen with your pup is really all about having fun with your furry friend. Maeby spoils me every day with her love and affection, so it’s nice every now and again to demonstrate how much she means to me by whipping up some fresh treats just for her.</p><h3>
<br/>Who Is This For?</h3><p>This book makes a great gift for all those dog lovers! <strong>Our release is planned for December 2020</strong> <strong>- just in the time for the holidays! </strong>Most recipes are beginner or intermediate level, so don't worry about your baking skills.

<br/>What We Need</h3><p>At this time, the book is about 90% finished, with only a few more stories to write and recipes to test. However, with the goal of delivering these to our supporters, dog lovers, and bakers by the holidays, we need pre-orders to help finance the initial order of books.</p><p>The goal of $7,500 will cover the down payment required to print an initial order at a higher quality than simply printing ""on-demand"". In the event that we can raise more than $7,500, funds will be put towards the outstanding payment required by my printer.

Our first walk was a funny encounter of us trying to observe each other, but there was an instant connection. Since that day, we’ve had so many great adventures.Because I am “that” dog lady, I used my love for baking to spoil Maeby on her birthdays and gotcha days. It’s been a 7 year tradition of baking some seriously special treats that she and I have both enjoyed. And last year, I realized I had enough recipes to write a book, so here we are!You’ll hopefully notice from our photos and the bakes themselves that spending time in the kitchen with your pup is really all about having fun with your furry friend. Maeby spoils me every day with her love and affection, so it’s nice every now and again to demonstrate how much she means to me by whipping up some fresh treats just for her.
Who Is This For?This book makes a great gift for all those dog lovers! Our release is planned for December 2020 - just in the time for the holidays! Most recipes are beginner or intermediate level, so don't worry about your baking skills. The best part about baking for your dog is that your pup will love it even if it's not quite perfect.Each recipe is designed so that there are clearly marked dog friendly recipes (""For Maeby"") and human recipes (""For Me""). The recipe below is a preview of what to expect. (Receive an advanced digital copy of 1 recipe with a contribution of $15 or more.)
What We NeedAt this time, the book is about 90% finished, with only a few more stories to write and recipes to test. However, with the goal of delivering these to our supporters, dog lovers, and bakers by the holidays, we need pre-orders to help finance the initial order of books.The goal of $7,500 will cover the down payment required to print an initial order at a higher quality than simply printing ""on-demand"". In the event that we can raise more than $7,500, funds will be put towards the outstanding payment required by my printer. In the event that we do not reach $7,500 or general interest is low, we may resort to an on-demand printer/distributor. SPREAD THE WORD!For those of you that can't contribute financially, there are other ways you can help!

The TeamOver the course of the past year and a half, one of my oldest and closest childhood friends Nick Holmes has been spending long weekends traveling back and forth between Chicago and New York City with me to bring this to life. A professional food photographer and graphic designer, Nick's expertise, coupled with my concept (and our designated tie breaker Simon Morgan) have helped propel this project forward. MAEBY | Inspiration/Treat TesterA seven year old terrier mix, Maeby hails from the streets of Houston, TX. Adopted by Jen Augello in 2013, Maeby has inspired people all over the world to be kind and love dogs. She enjoys the beach, agility class, ""coming with"", and testing all homemade dog treats, especially those including cheese. JEN AUGELLO | Author/CreatorA clarinetist, producer, and consultant, Jen usually spends much of her time with Maeby working with Sesame Workshop as the production manager of Sesame Street and The Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo and serves as the Director of Operations for Tertulia Chamber Music.  Based in New York City, Jen also loves baking, spending time with Maeby, and traveling. NICK HOLMES | Photographer/DesignerNick is a Chicago-based graphic designer with Antlur Creative who has worked with national brands and now has a strange obsession with food photography. (We think he’s just always hungry.) See more of Nick’s work at antlur.co and nickdoesfood.com.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i>A DWELLING PLACE FOR CHILDLESS WOMEN IN EVERY SEASON</i></h2>
<p>We are on a journey to create a trailblazing magazine for and by childless women shaping our society and culture, while helping women throughout the world cope through and beyond childlessness. </p>
<p>Despite the fact that approximately 1 in 5 women will remain childless—and for 90% of them, it was not by choice—there’s still a lack of representation of the perspectives and lives of involuntarily childless women in publications and media. </p>
<p><i>Tutum Journal</i> is a digital quarterly magazine that will further our mission to own our voice, control our narrative, shift perspectives and stigmas and deepen understandings to help women move from distress to fulfillment, helping them make deeper connection with like-minded women creating their own happiness and power in the world.</p>
<p><i>Tutum Journal</i> builds self-recovery, develops sisterhood and provides a safe space to be seen and heard. Literally, the name suggests a safe space, as the Latin word “tutum” can be defined as “safe.” Each magazine issue is a “big topic” guide, exploring many aspects of a theme that’s vitally important to the childless community. This is more than a magazine; it is a community. A conversation. A childless woman will always find herself  in our pages. This magazine belongs to us!</p>

<p><strong style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Who am I and why am I creating Tutum Journal?</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Hi, I’m <a href=""http://www.tutumglobal.com/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jobi Tyson</a>. At 40 years of age, I found myself at the end of my 20-year unexplained infertility journey as I was advised to get a hysterectomy. I felt alone, and stuck in a mid-life rut. After I went on a year-long quest to research the root cause of my infertility, I inadvertently found research-based strategies to better cope with permanent childlessness.</p>
<p>So, then I founded Tutum Global to provide a helping hand and inspiration to all those women out there feeling like they cannot cope and live beyond their childless state. <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Before that, I was an advertising agency executive for over 20 years. In working with major brands, I've helped launch magazines and campaigns for countless clients. However, in all of these industries, I felt the gravity of the under-representation and exclusion of childless women. </span>I saw there was something missing in magazines because media companies, and even brands don’t really reach us – they don’t speak to us. We typically don’t feel like the way they share content sounds like how we spoke about the different issues in our lives.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Over the years, I’ve earned a master’s degree in business administration, trained in cognitive behavioral therapy, sociocultural research and journalism, gained multimedia expertise, and learned the crafts of photography and web programming. My heart’s desire has been to launch a purposeful publication. And the time has come! Funding <i>Tutum Journal</i> is helping other childless women to find out their deeper purpose and begin their journey of self-discovery.</p>
<p>As the Editor-in-Chief of our highly anticipated digital magazine, <i>Tutum Journal</i>, and on behalf of our talented editorial team: Brandi Lytle of popular blog, <a href=""http://notsomommy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NotSoMommy.com</a>, Anita Henderson of <a href=""http://writeyourlife.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Write Your Life</a>, and former niche magazine editor-in-chief, and Charlotte Bishop of <a href=""http://mrkhconnect.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MRKH Connect</a>; we’re all so grateful for your support, and even more excited about what we’re going to build together.</p>

TheSophiaMag.com is the brainchild of Madge Madigan and Barb McSpadden. Sophia was conceived by immaculate conception from these two after realizing there were no magazines out their that appeal to clever, witty, intelligent adults (mostly women) who don't care about getting thinner thighs or fashion items that wouldn't fit a grown adult.
* Barb is a design wiz and has over 20 years of marketing experience and about 10 years in the magazine biz.
* Madge is a single mom of 3 kids now in college and post grad. She has over 20 years marketing experience and 5 years in the magazine biz.
We hope to bring incredibly interesting and inspiring articles and images to folks to educate and make you laugh. There is so much crap out there that just reinforces the shallow and divisive climate we are living in now. Your contribution can help us continue on our mission!
What We Need and What You Get

We need $5,000 (but could use more) for:
* Website upgrade and hosting
* Legal mumbo jumbo... create contracts, an LLC, and the like.
* Funds to start paying freelance writers.
* Marketing
* To create platforms to have webinars
We have awesome perks! Like Sophia T-shirts, pop sockets, launch party VIP invites, and incredibly advertising packages!
Break it down for folks in more detail:

The Impact
Please take a look at Thesophiamag.com for a taste of things to come. We think we have some powerful thought-provoking items that will change the way you think.

Risks & Challenges
Obviously we need advertisers and supporters to stay afloat. And it takes more writers to continue providing awesome content. Madge and Barb can't write the whole thing themselves, nor would we want them to, we love new and different perspectives!

<p>                             <strong>             Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Claude Alick, born on the island of Grenada. I'm the author of a collection of short stories, WET STORAGE AND OTHER STORIES and a novel, DANCING WITH THE YUMAWALLI and a play about Haiti, COWARDICE OF EYES, financed through Indiegogo. I wrote, produced and acted in the play. I'll never take on that much work again. That was a Bucket-list endeavor. This new project, ONCE ON THE ISLE OF SPICE is a labor of love, an ode to the island of Grenada, Grenadians of the past and an attempt to showcase our folklore, our history, and the magic of this gem, and her people to the rest of the world. Your contribution will help me to achieve this goal.</p>
<h2>        Looking backward to look forward</h2>
<p>I think some of the people of Grenada, as the old folks die off, have forgotten their past. This is an attempt to remind them of where they came from and what the future might hold, how history, mythology, and religion influence their lives. You can help me to deliver this message and enlighten a new generation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>     What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding from this campaign will go exclusively toward marketing this project to a wider audience, hiring a professional publicist to assist with navigating the maze of social and traditional media, connecting with blogs featuring interviews and reviews of authors and their books. For your contribution, you will receive a variety of spices and teas from Grenada, nutmeg, clove, cinnamon, turmeric and more, hermetically sealed and approved by the FDA. Not reaching my entire goal will be no hindrance. The foundation for this project is already in place. Your contribution toward the marketing will be extremely helpful. Funds for the editing and production of the book is already secured and deployed toward the production of the book.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>      The Impact of history</h3>
<p>In the early eighties, the might of the United States military descended of the island of Grenada to oust a group of politicians who thought they could do more for the people of Grenada than the ones who ruled prior to the coup to seize power. I think it's important for people to understand the details of colonialism, and how that history led to that conflict, why the most powerful country in the world attacked one of the weakest. My research before writing the play, COWARDICE OF EYES and successfully producing it, with funds secured through IndieGoGo, has endowed me with a deep knowledge of the history and politics of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>           <strong>  Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
</div><div><p>I see no risk or challenges in completing this project. I suppose no one can be 100% sure about anything.

<h3>Our story</h3>
<p><i>Notes from Poland</i> has for the last four years been produced by two academic colleagues: Stanley Bill, director of the Polish Studies Programme at the University of Cambridge, and Daniel Tilles, an assistant professor at the Pedagogical University of Kraków. We provide regular summaries of news from Poland, along with the insights, context and background necessary to make sense of what is happening here.</p>
<p>This has seen us become the most popular and trusted source of English-language news about Poland on social media, with almost 35,000 followers on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/notesfrompoland"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook </a>and over 10,000 on <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/notesfrompoland"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a>. Our reporting and insights have featured in a range of international media, including the BBC, <i>Foreign Policy</i> and the <i>Financial Times</i>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Our plans</strong></h3>
<p>There has never been a more important time to understand Poland and, as our success so far shows, there is growing international interest in a country that is increasingly prominent on the European and world stage.</p>
<p>Yet Poland’s rise has not been matched by a similar improvement in reliable English-language reporting on the country. Existing English news services dedicated to Poland are linked to the Polish state, meaning that their content reflects the government’s interests. Coverage of Poland in international media is sporadic and not always reliable due to a lack of investment in permanent reporters in the country.</p>
<p>This is a problem we have already sought to address. But to truly make a difference we need to move beyond social media and establish a more substantial web presence. We intend to re-launch <i>Notes from Poland</i> with a new website, offering comprehensive coverage of Polish current affairs, society, culture and history, as well as regular analysis and opinion from a wide range of expert authors. Over time, and depending on the funds we raise, we hope to add podcasts, a newsletter and videos, as well as to organise public events.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we have established a non-profit foundation in Poland that will be responsible for Notes from Poland. It is led by an experienced and dynamic board, whose work is supervised by an oversight committee and supported by an advisory panel made up of prominent figures from the worlds of culture, media and academia (see below).</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Why we need your support</strong></h3>
<p>Achieving these aims requires resources. Until now, all of our activity has been grassroots and voluntary. We have received no funding and generated no revenue. But to go beyond social media we need to make a significant initial investment and then require further funds to maintain and expand our work as we take on the staffing, technical and other costs associated with producing high-quality media content.</p>
<p>Raising this money with the support of our readers will also help us to preserve the independence that has characterised our work so far. Moreover, it will allow us to continue making our content available to everyone interested in Poland, without any paywalls.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are one of our long-time followers who appreciates the work we have done and wants to help us take it further. Or perhaps you are discovering us for the first time but recognise the need for objective, reliable and informed reporting on Poland. Whatever the case, we hope that you can support us as we take these next steps.</p>
<p>Finally, because we operate as a non-profit foundation, bound by the provisions of Polish law on such entities, you can be assured that every cent, penny or grosz you are able to provide us with will be invested directly into <i>Notes from Poland</i>, to cover the costs necessary to move forward with our plans.</p>

<div>The Life &amp; Legacy of Cyrus The Great<br/><br/>Cyrus created the largest empire the world had ever seen, The Persian Empire –– stretching across Asia, the Middle East, Europe and even parts of Africa.

<h3>My story to Almost Fearless</h3>
<p>At the age of 19, I stepped through a wall of fear in my life and became a small business owner. Little did I know, it would open up my life to fully exposing myself for who I am;  a leader, healer and psychic with a passion for creating safe and supportive space for others to learn and grow into their own gifts. </p>
<p>I have found that no matter who we are, we are all bound together in a fear-based society. Each of us carries our own fears and many of us are conditioned to live in fear of being different or the fear of walking alone on our journey. </p>
<p>Whether the journey involves psychic gifts or a fear of public speaking, none of us deserves to walk it alone. In A Life Lived Medium: A Psychic's Journey from Fearful to <i>Almost</i> Fearless I show my vulnerability so that others are inspired and encouraged to walk an almost fearless life by embracing their gifts and their differences as well. My goal is to lead by example by putting myself out there with this memoir. I stepped through my fear so that, hopefully, others will do the same. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We lose one person every 40 seconds to suicide and another 20 attempts happen in that same time. Mental health has never been more important.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Adam Stevens and I work as an educator in Australia in a high school. I see and experience first hand the devastation of adverse mental health, depression and anxiety in the students I work with daily. When I was just 12 my mother tried to take her own life. This impacted our family massively. After several other failed attempts my Mother took her own life at 56 years of age, after years of battling mental health issues and depression. Four years ago I came up with the idea for the book and I have recently completed it. Together with your support I hope to publish Catchers and further reduce the stigma around depression and mental health and help those who are in desperate need of guidance. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The budget of $35,000 will allow the publishing of 20,000 copies and the promotion of the book through a well designed book launch and social media campaign.</p>
<p>We are excited to offer all of our contributors a copy of the very first edition as well as the ability to contribute to the promotion of this very important message through becoming a distributor and or attending the launch in December. </p>
<p>After reaching the campaigns target we will deliver a powerful message through 20,000 hard copies, an audio book, listing on Amazon, and a powerful social media campaign. Help us to reduce the number of needless losses to suicide.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect that impacts on families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies. Suicides are preventable. Much can be done to prevent suicide at individual, community and national levels. I am a regular contributor in the Education sector on engagement and well being of youth and his book is very much a culmination of my experience, knowledge and deep seeded desire to improve peoples mental health.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book and completing my promise of mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order level.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with our printers to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you.

Pacific News Service was a non-profit media organization, with projects focused on developing young journalists, promoting ethnic media,  publishing the work of incarcerated people, young people in foster care, homeless youth, and academics and public intellectuals whose perspectives were absent from the discourse. It was our breeding ground, the place where we developed our news brains, learned to approach stories from unique perspectives and learned from each other.

Kwest On Media Editor In Chief Russell Morse came to Pacific News Service when he was incarcerated at San Francisco’s juvenile hall and soon saw his writing in national publications.

Our guests have included San Francisco taxi drivers, a rapper from St. Petersburg, Florida, a trans rights activist, a New York City medical examiner who investigates fatal drug overdoses, a young Muslim woman working at a tech startup, and an American expatriate working at a factory in Germany.

<h3>I am a designer, a creative mind, and a sensitive soul. I am the Digital Design Director at The Guardian, I have worked as a teacher at Shillington College for two years, teaching on the part time course. I have a passion for design, design education, and mental health. I am the author of this little book. It’s a very important topic to me, and it’s one I think that as an industry we don’t talk about enough. Not to mention that I have myself suffered from a variety of things with my mental health - and I think it's time that we talk about it. </h3>
<p>By supporting this campaign and donating towards the production of the book, you will, by proxy be supporting young creatives, who like me might have suffered with mental health, anxiety and depression which can manifest itself in many ways. </p>
<p>This is somewhat my story - and told through the lens that I know, graphic design, but i hope this will be a useful tool for many creatives and people who are interested in mental health. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>This book is a collection of experiences about creativity and mental health. The book takes the focus of graphic design as I have been practicing as a designer for nearly 15 years, it felt right to write it from my personal perspective. I wanted to collect together my thoughts around mental health for a couple of reasons. I am a designer who has suffered or at least struggled with mental health issues over the past few years. I think it’s important to share with the design community, and open this up to people who might like me sometimes struggle. </p>
<p>I believe that as a creative person there is an intrinsic link between the mind, the health of the mind and being creative. I think that within our industry we need to be aware of this link, and take care of our mental health no matter what profession, as this will inevitably lead people to feeling more creative, and be able to sustain that creative drive and enthusiasm for what they do. </p>
<p>In the 60 pages contained within this humble little publication I have collected together my thoughts, and experiences of graduating from university, working as a junior, working with clients, exceptions and pressure, all the way to working as Digital Design Director at The Guardian. All in all, I hope that people find something useful enclosed within these pages.</p>

<h3>Who</h3>
<p>This book has been produced because I believe it to be a useful companion to students, junior designers, aspiring designer, or anyone who is like me a creative mind, that is often frustrated, sometimes anxious, but always looking to better themselves in solving problems, challenges and doing great work. </p>
<p>Beyond that I see this book as a valuable tool for creative people to think more mindfully about their practice, and hopefully will be a comfort for those who are feeling they can’t, even though they can. Those people can feel in good company with other designers who feel just the same. </p>

</div></div>","I am a designer, a creative mind, and a sensitive soul. I am the Digital Design Director at The Guardian, I have worked as a teacher at Shillington College for two years, teaching on the part time course. I have a passion for design, design education, and mental health. I am the author of this little book. It’s a very important topic to me, and it’s one I think that as an industry we don’t talk about enough. Not to mention that I have myself suffered from a variety of things with my mental health - and I think it's time that we talk about it. 
By supporting this campaign and donating towards the production of the book, you will, by proxy be supporting young creatives, who like me might have suffered with mental health, anxiety and depression which can manifest itself in many ways. 
This is somewhat my story - and told through the lens that I know, graphic design, but i hope this will be a useful tool for many creatives and people who are interested in mental health. 


What We Need & What You Get
For this project I need around £3000 as an initial investment into printing and producing a book which I will send out some to Universities, and schools, and sell the majority - of which any of the profit will be give to mental health charities.

<p>One of the most misunderstood and most important bands in the history of music is <strong>Black Sabbath.</strong> To the uninitiated, their music is loud, annoying, Satan-worshipping nonsense. To those who get it, Black Sabbath provided a soundtrack, not only for the disenfranchised of the '70s and dreamers of the '80s, but for pure music lovers...those who wanted more from their music.  </p>

<p><strong>BLACK SABBATH: THE VINYL TESTAMENT</strong> is a deep dive into the history of the band, from their first album until THE END! Every album is picked apart, the stories leading into it are told, and each song is reviewed. Written by music journalist/historian/podcaster <strong><i>Matt ""Matman"" Herring</i>,  THE VINYL TESTAMENT</strong> is an intimate look into a half-century of bone-crushing riffs, thought-provoking lyrics, a band that had to fight for, and are still fighting for, every bit of respect they deserve. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Like his previous music books, <strong>UFO: YOUR FAVORITE BAND'S FAVORITE BAND</strong> and <strong>ASIA: TIME AND TIME AGAIN</strong>, Herring has shared his thoughts about another band that means so much to him. “When I write about a band, I am completely honest. If I don’t like something, I will say it. But I will always preface my remarks by reminding the reader that this is my opinion and it doesn’t make the band or its music bad.” As a lover of history, Herring writes his books as history lessons about his favorite bands, telling a story that instills or rekindles a love for his subjects.</p>

<p>""One of the big things I learned from writing this book was how Black Sabbath never had the support they needed from their management and record labels.

<p>The book also explores its members pre- and post-Black Sabbath careers, including the story of <i><strong>Jimi Bell</strong></i>, currently the guitarist for Autograph and House Of Lords. In 1987, Bell auditioned to play in Ozzy Osbourne's band, and made into the top two during the audition process. He would later join the Geezer Butler Band until that project fell apart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BLACK SABBATH: THE VINYL TESTAMENT</strong> is a full-color, 200+ page book that features an incredible cover by Andrew Edge, which cleverly pays homage to The Beatles for a reason that is explained in the book, and is a band that both Black Sabbath and Herring love.

</div><p>My name is Brandon Ferdig. I'm a writer who spent most of 2014
volunteering at a village school in Tanzania, East Africa. Now I'm back in
Minnesota, and I'm planning a speaking tour to share my experiences with those
who have been reading about them over the past year</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It all started two years ago. I was seeking an opportunity to
live abroad when I met a Tanzanian man who needed someone to help start his
village school's computer classes. </p>
<p>After <a href=""https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/0X14a/ab/61Gdm0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">raising money</a> and buying 10
laptops, I flew out to Tanzania to put them to use. And on January 25, 2014, I
arrived at the village Magulilwa and the school, Magulilwa Area Secondary School.</p>
<p>I stayed in a small room at the school. No plumbing. No regular
electricity. I ate what they ate. I lived on campus as did the other teachers
and students. </p>
<p>And I taught computers for eight months.</p>

volunteering at a village school in Tanzania, East Africa. Now I'm back in
Minnesota, and I'm planning a speaking tour to share my experiences with those
who have been reading about them over the past year
***
It all started two years ago. I was seeking an opportunity to
live abroad when I met a Tanzanian man who needed someone to help start his
village school's computer classes. 
After raising money and buying 10
laptops, I flew out to Tanzania to put them to use. And on January 25, 2014, I
arrived at the village Magulilwa and the school, Magulilwa Area Secondary School.
I stayed in a small room at the school. No plumbing. No regular
electricity. I ate what they ate. I lived on campus as did the other teachers
and students. 
And I taught computers for eight months.

This was just the start of my experiences...
In the village, I would become their portrait
photographer. 

I would leave the village and travel to every corner of Tanzania, as well as to other countries in the region. 
Most important, I explored and documented the ways of life I saw
each step of the way.Politics:Commerce:Religion:

<p><b>Jason Pednault</b> was a gold prospector who suffered a brutal murder attempt while in
the Amazon jungle in 2011.  He was
beaten, strangled and then thrown off a cliff by two young men: indigenous
inhabitants of the region where he was working. </p>
<p>As soon as he was able, he went back to the site of the attack to
find out why it happened and to investigate the strange circumstances of his
survival. This return set him on a journey that resulted in the creation of <b style=""font-style: italic;""><a href=""http://www.amazonawareness.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A.S.A.P.</a> </b>and<b> </b><i style=""font-weight: bold;""><a href=""http://www.puresynergyherbs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pure Synergy Herbs.</a> </i></p>
<p><b><i></i><a href=""http://www.amazonawareness.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A.S.A.P. (Amazon Sustainability and Awareness Project)</a></b> is an organisation
that seeks to protect the Amazon region and its inhabitants (including his

<h3>What's it all about?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Eagle’s Flight </b>is a tale of survival, and of how each and every experience has the
potential to remake us anew. Exciting, dark, comic and optimistic, it is full
of strange plot twists, magical characters and mystery. It is also a true story that gives answers to the questions we should all be asking - if we want to
survive too.</p>
<p>From a childhood of haunted ruins and underground caverns, to adolescent years
of gold sniping and confinement in a brutal educational facility for troubled
teens. We follow Jason as he dodges bears, falls in love with a tragic escape
artist and begins a bizarre apprenticeship with an obsessive suburban herpetologist. All before leaving high school!</p>
<p>Later, his wild
quest for gold and adventure takes him from the freezing wilderness of Alaska,
through the backwoods of Oregon and on to the steaming jungles of Central and South America. Always running, without ever realizing where to or what from, until a face-to-face encounter with a jaguar and a chance meeting with an
amiable fantasist leads him to Ecuador - and to the attempt on his life that
becomes the catalyst for his most incredible journey yet. </p>

<b><b><b></b></b></b><p><b>Falling to Fly</b></p>
<p>Ever since I was a kid I always wanted to fly. Throughout my childhood, I would climb to the top of tall trees and look out, wishing I could take wing and soar, higher and higher; to travel great distances, and see the world from afar; pristine, wild and beautiful.</p>
<p>As I grew, I was told repeatedly my dream wasn’t possible. Humans, as a species, are not made to fly. Sure, I could catch a plane if I wanted, but under no circumstances would I be allowed the kind of daily exhilaration and autonomy our feathered friends take for granted. Perhaps I should have accepted that ‘fact’, and gone about my business like a good little American consumer. But I couldn’t. I had to keep my dream alive.</p>
<p>Dreams are dangerous, however. They are both a gift and a curse. It is true our most incredible accomplishments are born of dreams, but so are our most destructive - often without anybody realizing which is which, until much later. Daydreams, night dreams, plans, plots and schemes become shelter, security, bridges, tunnels, weapons, wars, vehicles, television … you get the picture. For good or ill, it is our ability to turn dreams into reality that sets us apart from the rest of the animals that share our planet (or so I thought, but we’ll get to that later).</p>
<p>As I flew up into the silvery sky, I knew my dreams had led me there. I could have stayed in the States like my sister, had a family and settled on a regular nine to five. Instead, I was in the Amazon jungle of Ecuador, beaten and bloody, and flying.</p>
<p>Time slowed as I rose. The air held me in a whispered embrace, and far below me, the unspoiled wilderness stretched into the distance; a dense canopy of rolling greens. Heavy rain had fallen throughout the night, making the lush foliage glisten. A slash of roiling whites and browns below caught my attention. The river at the bottom of the cliff beckoned, insistent, roaring its invitation to join the clatter of boulders being carried off downstream.</p>
<p>The two men responsible for my inaugural flight looked on impassively, their bare chests still heaving from the effort of hurling me over the cliff’s edge. I arced away from them, limbs flailing and clawing in slow motion. Split seconds passed like hours. But then gravity took over and I dropped like a stone. I had come seeking gold and adventure, and had found both. Not only that, I had also realized my lifelong ambition of flight. The downside was it looked as though it would cost me my life.</p>
<p>What happened next is hard to explain, or rather, it’s hard to believe. I hit the cliff face for the first time about twenty feet down, and bounced off in a spray of rocks and mud and blood. Like most cliffs in the ever-shifting landscape of the Amazon, this one wasn’t completely vertical. There were slight inclines gouged by erosion that ensured every inch of my body suffered a hefty blow as I spun, smacked and skidded down. Throughout the descent, I fought to stay conscious and alert. I knew the odds of surviving a hundred and fifty foot drop into raging rapids were minimal, but I had no intention of reducing them further by closing my eyes and giving up.</p>
<p>As I fell, I felt oddly calm - as if it wasn’t me plummeting to my death at all, but somebody else, someone separate from me. Instead of just focusing on the moment, my mind wandered and I found myself reliving the details of an earlier fall - from an eighty-foot Pecan tree - that I had survived as a child. I recalled the blur of wet leaves and lashing branches, and the way time had stretched (just as it was now) allowing me to see and catch the sturdier limbs that would slow and eventually break my fall. At the time I felt as if the branches were calling me, swaying to catch my attention from ten, twenty feet below.</p>
<p>Trees, like most plants, are spectacularly generous; they give food, shade and shelter freely and indiscriminately. I had climbed that particular tree at least half a hundred times, and looked upon it as an old friend. Afterwards, I thought maybe it had been looking out for me when I fell. Offering a helping hand to the small boy who had sought sanctuary in its dense branches so many times before. If you find that idea a little ridiculous, what happened as I hurtled down the cliff face will seem even more so. In fact, I wouldn’t believe it myself had I not lived through it. I am certain that without some kind of help, there is no way anyone could have survived that fall.</p>
<p>The cliff face was made up of slick crumbling earth and rock, with a liberal scattering of scratchy little trees and stunted bushes. Unfortunately, the foothold the tenacious twigs and shrubs had made on the cliff face was far too fragile to offer any help. I grabbed at them but my weight and the speed at which I was tumbling and falling were too much for their scrawny roots to bear. They ripped away in my hands like so many cobwebs.</p>
<p>The only other vegetation on the cliff face were tufts of coarse grass, and a sparse network of clinging vines that crept up from the thin strip of green lining the edge of the river below. After clutching at both the grasses and vines a couple of times, only to have them also fall away, I had written them off to be as useless to my plight as the shrubs. But then things changed. The vines beneath me started to move. I thought it a trick of the eye at first, and for all I know, at that stage, it could have been. Still, they appeared to gather and rise in clumps that snagged and buffeted me, first one way then the other, slowing my fall and moving me further and further to the left.</p>
<p>Beyond the clusters of vines, I noticed the near vertical cliff face I was careening down was about to disappear. As much as the vines had helped, the drop-off was still coming up too fast. Soon enough, I was airborne again. This fall was a big one - around sixty feet – and I knew the moment I hit solid earth again it would be game over.</p>
<p>Then something magical happened. A thick curl of vine whipped out from the ledge above and wound itself around my leg, yanking me back with an almighty crack. The pain in my hip joint was excruciating as I swung like a pendulum, across, and then down. About ten feet above the ground, the vine unraveled and released me. My body should have been pulp and shattered bones by now. As it was, it just hurt like hell.</p>
<p>This last impact knocked the wind out of me and set me bouncing and crashing down the final straight toward the river. I stole a glance at the seething rapids and was shocked to see a lone tree in my path. Thick and sturdy, it jutted at an incongruous angle six feet from the river’s edge, its lush foliage dark and streaming. I lunged toward it. My hands slapped against the smooth bark, but the rest of my body kept going. Gripping that tree took all the strength I had left, and for a moment I dangled, legs swinging above the churning water, my hands slipping and scrabbling, until, eventually, I hauled myself up onto the trunk.</p>
<p>I was dazed, battered and bruised. But I was alive. Not for the first time, Mother Nature seemed to have appointed herself my personal guardian angel, and I couldn’t help but wonder why. I had always loved the natural world, but as a gold prospector I’d done nothing but disturb and exploit the environments where I worked. True enough, my practices weren’t as destructive as most, but it wasn’t as if I were a good warden of the earth either.</p>
<p>Grateful, high on life and rushing on adrenaline, I bent and kissed the tree, then reached out and touched the nearest vine, wincing at the movement. Despite the pain, I laughed, realizing how fortunate, how blessed I was, and I vowed to somehow repay those magnificent plants for saving me.</p>
<p>I know that sounds crazy, but even now, years later, I feel the same way. Perhaps even more so after all I’ve discovered and achieved since then. At that moment however, I had to concentrate on getting out of the mess I was in. I may have survived the fall, but the river still roiled beneath me, and the cliff face loomed as sheer and insurmountable as a castle wall above.</p>
<p>In order to survive, human beings are capable of incredible feats. We have been known to lift immense weight, to hack off trapped limbs and endure the most severe hardships in order to draw breath for one more day. All I had to do was tap into that latent potential, ignore my injuries, and find a way out. Easier said than done, I know. But if I could do that, then I knew anything was possible - I might even be able to keep my unlikely promise to the plants.</p>
<p>However, before I tell you what happened next, I should really begin with how I came to be there in the first place….</p>

As soon as he was able, he went back to the site of the attack to
find out why it happened and to investigate the strange circumstances of his
survival. This return set him on a journey that resulted in the creation of A.S.A.P. and Pure Synergy Herbs. 
A.S.A.P. (Amazon Sustainability and Awareness Project) is an organisation
that seeks to protect the Amazon region and its inhabitants (including his
would-be-murderers), and to promote worldwide solutions to counteract the
devastating impact of industrial civilisation.  Pure Synergy Herbs is an
example of one of those solutions: a not-for-profit* business that promotes
healing through the use of traditional natural medicines, while supporting the
rehabilitation of the Earth through its relationship with A.S.A.P.

*not-for-profit businesses can still make
profits, but those profits are reinvested for social or organisational benefit, rather than accumulated by private individuals.


Matheu DeSilva is a professional author, musician and storyteller. He has worked
with the indigenous tribes of the Ecuadorian Amazon for many years and is also
actively involved in the development of the A.S.A.P. movement.
Stacey Joy is a musician, singer, songwriter and voice over artist. 
As well as lending her dulcet tones to the campaign video, she is also gifting exclusive newly recorded tracks to all contributors to the cause. 

What's it all about?

Eagle’s Flight is a tale of survival, and of how each and every experience has the
potential to remake us anew. Exciting, dark, comic and optimistic, it is full
of strange plot twists, magical characters and mystery. It is also a true story that gives answers to the questions we should all be asking - if we want to
survive too.
From a childhood of haunted ruins and underground caverns, to adolescent years
of gold sniping and confinement in a brutal educational facility for troubled
teens. We follow Jason as he dodges bears, falls in love with a tragic escape
artist and begins a bizarre apprenticeship with an obsessive suburban herpetologist. All before leaving high school!
Later, his wild
quest for gold and adventure takes him from the freezing wilderness of Alaska,
through the backwoods of Oregon and on to the steaming jungles of Central and South America. Always running, without ever realizing where to or what from, until a face-to-face encounter with a jaguar and a chance meeting with an
amiable fantasist leads him to Ecuador - and to the attempt on his life that
becomes the catalyst for his most incredible journey yet.

Today, we live in a world that needs
to change - and this is a story that has the power to do just that. From high
adventure to higher consciousness, Eagle’s
Flight offers the reader something unique: the chance to become a part of the story!
As well as being an exhilarating and inspirational read, the book also
explores the founding ideals of the A.S.A.P. movement. In short, it offers hope
in the fight to preserve life in the Amazon and beyond. 
A large part of the A.S.A.P. message concerns not-for-profit oriented
business practices and empowering every day individuals to make a difference in the world. With
this in mind, we made the conscious decision to bypass a traditional publishing
house and produce this book independently - with the help of everyday people
like you! 
By publishing this book ourselves we ensure that ALL PROFITS will to
go toward the establishment and development of the A.S.A.P. education centers
in Peru and Ecuador, and to the promotion of A.S.A.P. philosophies, such as
permaculture, plant-based medicines, intentional community development and
not-for-profit oriented business practices, worldwide.

 EmailSneak Peek:
Falling to Fly
Ever since I was a kid I always wanted to fly. Throughout my childhood, I would climb to the top of tall trees and look out, wishing I could take wing and soar, higher and higher; to travel great distances, and see the world from afar; pristine, wild and beautiful.
As I grew, I was told repeatedly my dream wasn’t possible. Humans, as a species, are not made to fly. Sure, I could catch a plane if I wanted, but under no circumstances would I be allowed the kind of daily exhilaration and autonomy our feathered friends take for granted. Perhaps I should have accepted that ‘fact’, and gone about my business like a good little American consumer. But I couldn’t. I had to keep my dream alive.
Dreams are dangerous, however. They are both a gift and a curse. It is true our most incredible accomplishments are born of dreams, but so are our most destructive - often without anybody realizing which is which, until much later. Daydreams, night dreams, plans, plots and schemes become shelter, security, bridges, tunnels, weapons, wars, vehicles, television … you get the picture. For good or ill, it is our ability to turn dreams into reality that sets us apart from the rest of the animals that share our planet (or so I thought, but we’ll get to that later).
As I flew up into the silvery sky, I knew my dreams had led me there. I could have stayed in the States like my sister, had a family and settled on a regular nine to five. Instead, I was in the Amazon jungle of Ecuador, beaten and bloody, and flying.
Time slowed as I rose. The air held me in a whispered embrace, and far below me, the unspoiled wilderness stretched into the distance; a dense canopy of rolling greens. Heavy rain had fallen throughout the night, making the lush foliage glisten. A slash of roiling whites and browns below caught my attention. The river at the bottom of the cliff beckoned, insistent, roaring its invitation to join the clatter of boulders being carried off downstream.
The two men responsible for my inaugural flight looked on impassively, their bare chests still heaving from the effort of hurling me over the cliff’s edge. I arced away from them, limbs flailing and clawing in slow motion. Split seconds passed like hours. But then gravity took over and I dropped like a stone. I had come seeking gold and adventure, and had found both. Not only that, I had also realized my lifelong ambition of flight. The downside was it looked as though it would cost me my life.
What happened next is hard to explain, or rather, it’s hard to believe. I hit the cliff face for the first time about twenty feet down, and bounced off in a spray of rocks and mud and blood. Like most cliffs in the ever-shifting landscape of the Amazon, this one wasn’t completely vertical. There were slight inclines gouged by erosion that ensured every inch of my body suffered a hefty blow as I spun, smacked and skidded down. Throughout the descent, I fought to stay conscious and alert. I knew the odds of surviving a hundred and fifty foot drop into raging rapids were minimal, but I had no intention of reducing them further by closing my eyes and giving up.
As I fell, I felt oddly calm - as if it wasn’t me plummeting to my death at all, but somebody else, someone separate from me. Instead of just focusing on the moment, my mind wandered and I found myself reliving the details of an earlier fall - from an eighty-foot Pecan tree - that I had survived as a child. I recalled the blur of wet leaves and lashing branches, and the way time had stretched (just as it was now) allowing me to see and catch the sturdier limbs that would slow and eventually break my fall. At the time I felt as if the branches were calling me, swaying to catch my attention from ten, twenty feet below.
Trees, like most plants, are spectacularly generous; they give food, shade and shelter freely and indiscriminately. I had climbed that particular tree at least half a hundred times, and looked upon it as an old friend. Afterwards, I thought maybe it had been looking out for me when I fell. Offering a helping hand to the small boy who had sought sanctuary in its dense branches so many times before. If you find that idea a little ridiculous, what happened as I hurtled down the cliff face will seem even more so. In fact, I wouldn’t believe it myself had I not lived through it. I am certain that without some kind of help, there is no way anyone could have survived that fall.
The cliff face was made up of slick crumbling earth and rock, with a liberal scattering of scratchy little trees and stunted bushes. Unfortunately, the foothold the tenacious twigs and shrubs had made on the cliff face was far too fragile to offer any help. I grabbed at them but my weight and the speed at which I was tumbling and falling were too much for their scrawny roots to bear. They ripped away in my hands like so many cobwebs.
The only other vegetation on the cliff face were tufts of coarse grass, and a sparse network of clinging vines that crept up from the thin strip of green lining the edge of the river below. After clutching at both the grasses and vines a couple of times, only to have them also fall away, I had written them off to be as useless to my plight as the shrubs. But then things changed. The vines beneath me started to move. I thought it a trick of the eye at first, and for all I know, at that stage, it could have been. Still, they appeared to gather and rise in clumps that snagged and buffeted me, first one way then the other, slowing my fall and moving me further and further to the left.
Beyond the clusters of vines, I noticed the near vertical cliff face I was careening down was about to disappear. As much as the vines had helped, the drop-off was still coming up too fast. Soon enough, I was airborne again. This fall was a big one - around sixty feet – and I knew the moment I hit solid earth again it would be game over.
Then something magical happened. A thick curl of vine whipped out from the ledge above and wound itself around my leg, yanking me back with an almighty crack. The pain in my hip joint was excruciating as I swung like a pendulum, across, and then down. About ten feet above the ground, the vine unraveled and released me. My body should have been pulp and shattered bones by now. As it was, it just hurt like hell.
This last impact knocked the wind out of me and set me bouncing and crashing down the final straight toward the river. I stole a glance at the seething rapids and was shocked to see a lone tree in my path. Thick and sturdy, it jutted at an incongruous angle six feet from the river’s edge, its lush foliage dark and streaming. I lunged toward it. My hands slapped against the smooth bark, but the rest of my body kept going. Gripping that tree took all the strength I had left, and for a moment I dangled, legs swinging above the churning water, my hands slipping and scrabbling, until, eventually, I hauled myself up onto the trunk.
I was dazed, battered and bruised. But I was alive. Not for the first time, Mother Nature seemed to have appointed herself my personal guardian angel, and I couldn’t help but wonder why. I had always loved the natural world, but as a gold prospector I’d done nothing but disturb and exploit the environments where I worked. True enough, my practices weren’t as destructive as most, but it wasn’t as if I were a good warden of the earth either.
Grateful, high on life and rushing on adrenaline, I bent and kissed the tree, then reached out and touched the nearest vine, wincing at the movement. Despite the pain, I laughed, realizing how fortunate, how blessed I was, and I vowed to somehow repay those magnificent plants for saving me.
I know that sounds crazy, but even now, years later, I feel the same way. Perhaps even more so after all I’ve discovered and achieved since then. At that moment however, I had to concentrate on getting out of the mess I was in. I may have survived the fall, but the river still roiled beneath me, and the cliff face loomed as sheer and insurmountable as a castle wall above.
In order to survive, human beings are capable of incredible feats. We have been known to lift immense weight, to hack off trapped limbs and endure the most severe hardships in order to draw breath for one more day. All I had to do was tap into that latent potential, ignore my injuries, and find a way out. Easier said than done, I know. But if I could do that, then I knew anything was possible - I might even be able to keep my unlikely promise to the plants.
However, before I tell you what happened next, I should really begin with how I came to be there in the first place….
Thank you for your support! We look forward to hearing from you soon!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I'm from Australia but living in Cambodia, and have been for the last 3 months (at the time of writing this).</p>
<p>In Australia I moved a lot, within a city, and to multiple different cities. I've grown up with an amazing mother and an abusive father. I've lived below the poverty line, and I've had everything a girl could want. I'm currently a recovering addict, but while I was using I've had to sell myself to have a roof over my head, been raped, and had a boyfriend who destroyed me mentally and emotionally. I never finished high school, but I started university (BSc), and I've been working since I was 15. I've done just about everything from hospitality, mechanic, body piercer, IT, HR and marketing, lab work, and teaching, to business start up.</p>
<p>I first came here (Siem Reap) in October 2014, the day after I left rehab. It was the stupidest and the best thing I have ever done and I moved here 2 months later. What I found here was inner peace, gratitude, and a spirituality I had not experienced before. For me it was, and still is, pure beauty. The people are so beautiful, friendly, and happy. I naturally wake up early, sit in my backyard and watch the sun rise and listen to the buddhist monks praying in the morning. It is so serene.</p>
<p>The campaign to raise funds is to help me stay here and keep doing what I'm doing and more. I still have debt in Australia that I'm trying to pay while earning Cambodian wage, and it's not really working.</p>
<p>Here in Siem Reap I work as a Body Piercer in a tattoo studio, I teach kids English, I'm studying Khmer, and learning Bokator, and helping locals find new and better jobs. I'm writing two books. One is erotic short stories, and one is short stories from Khmer Rouge survivors that I meet. Very different but both interesting to me.</p>
<p>What I want to do is volunteer more. I want to teach more kids english, first aid, encourage creativity, and particularly, address the drug addiction problem here that goes unspoken about.</p>
<p>I can't do anything if I can't stay.</p>
<p>Contributing means that you will change my life, and help me change the lives of other people.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>$7000 is the amount of debt I have left in Australia. My wage pays my rent and food. I'm not asking for any extra to profit, because I don't need it. </p>
<p>If contributions exceed what I need to stay, the excess will go to locals. I especially want to combat addiction here so extra will go towards that. That would involve supplies like literature, doctors, detoxing and rehabilitation, family counselling, housing, and getting the kids in school. </p>
<p>Perks! $80 or higher donations means I will send you the erotic stories after they've been edited, as I write them!</p>
<p>If I don't reach the entire goal, anything that has been raised will go towards paying off my debt back in Australia and will keep me in Cambodia for a while longer to keep making changes!</p>

<p>Helping other people helps me.</p>
<p>The other challenge would be introducing a new way to deal with drug addiction here, getting the word out, and making changes. Most of the police here are corrupt and get bribed to look the other way. In Sydney I experienced the help addicts can give addicts and I did what I could to pass the love on. I've also helped a start up business get off the ground running. Once it was going I handed it over, but I know I can get the word out. I can market, and network, and I'm sure I can do it again for something I'm passionate about!</p>

Most of the police here are corrupt and get bribed to look the other way. In Sydney I experienced the help addicts can give addicts and I did what I could to pass the love on. I've also helped a start up business get off the ground running. Once it was going I handed it over, but I know I can get the word out. I can market, and network, and I'm sure I can do it again for something I'm passionate about!

    Other Ways You Can Help Sometimes people just aren't in a position to help, but believe in a cause. I've been there. 
So there are other ways you can help!
Help me get the word out.
Spread my campaign. Tell your friends and family. 
Use the Indiegogo share tools!
If you know someone who can help here, let me know!  And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are All Grown-Up Books, an independent publishing company based out of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. We strive to create thoughtful, inclusive, and diverse works that ask and answer interesting, culturally-relevant questions with creativity and good humour.<br/></p>
<p>Two years ago we published our first book with the help of IndieGoGo funders, a collection of essays about being a grown-up, and now we're back for our next anthology!</p>
<p>All Grown-Up Books wants to create a compendium of rad women throughout history! The end result will be a collection of essays profiling the lives and exploits of the women that history forgot. We're calling it: <i>Rad Women and the Things They Did</i>. Because they're rad. And we want you to know what they did.</p>
<p>We are super excited for this project: women have done amazing things throughout history and we want to share their successes and exploits with you. Contributed by writers from around the world, the book will include 28 essays about women throughout history into today - including an interview with the fabulous Calpernia Addams!</p>
<p>On top of all these awesome essays about these rad women, we've got an amazing illustrator lined up. Kim Flynn is a Toronto-based artist who grew up in Prince Edward Island and attended the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, Nova Scotia. For examples of her artwork, check out her <a href=""https://instagram.com/mokhii/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">instagram</a> and her <a href=""http://mokhii.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tumblr</a>.</p>

<p>We're asking for exactly how much we need to get this book published. The breakdown goes like this:</p>
<p>$2,866.50 - Printing the books<span><br/></span><span>$1,650.00 - Paying our authors<span><br/></span><span>$1,000.00 - Paying our cover designer and illustrator (see above)<span><br/></span><span>$1,090.00 - Marketing</span></span></span></p>

<p>Well, aside from that warm fuzzy feeling you get for doing good things and just being generally <i>awesome</i>, we're offering perks like copies of the book, posters, signed prints of the illustrations, and even a tote bag! For details about the perks, check out the side bar!</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Women have made a huge impact on our collective human history, but their stories tend to be lost to a male-centric narrative that does our history books a disservice. When we think about the accomplishments that our species has achieved throughout the short time we've been alive on this rock, we don't tend to picture women at the helm of much of it. But they have been. Women have been writing, adventuring, exploring, leading, inventing, swashbuckling, and changing the world alongside their male counterparts since we first stepped on land.</p>
<p>So, it's time to change the narrative. We feel that this book is one small step in that direction. Boys and girls both need to see examples of powerful and successful women throughout our history - it not only empowers young girls and women to take the big leaps themselves, but encourages young boys and men to respect the women around them in the same way that they respect the men they see.</p>
<p>Recognizing the accomplishments of the women in our world is a stepping stone to equality for everyone, regardless of their gender, let alone their race, orientation, or creed. This book is our contribution to that effort.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>As a company, we have the success of our first book under our belts, and our team has the collective experience required to bring this project to fruition.</div>
<div>Publishing as an independent company has its challenges, but we are dedicated, passionate, and driven to fulfill our mission statement: creating thoughtful, inclusive, and diverse works that ask and answer interesting, culturally-relevant questions with creativity and good humour.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We understand that not everyone is in a financial position to contribute, even a small amount. And if that's the case, you can still help!</p>
<p>By sharing this campaign through your social media, telling your friends and colleagues about it, and generally just sharing this with anyone who will listen to your rad self telling them about this rad project, you can help lots! So share away!</p>
<p>A special thanks goes out to Jessica MacDonald, who donated her time, effort, and expertise in shooting and editing our campaign video. Thanks, Jess!</p>

=====================================================

With great respect and humility I'm reaching out to ask for your support for the ""Xicana Chronicles"" project by funding the launch of our community publishing house.  My name is Iris and  I'm a Xicana multimedia producer and digital activist from Texas who has participated in several community-based campaigns since 2005.  
In 2014 I created Xicana Chronicles, a multimedia publishing platform aimed at collectively publishing the journeys and experiences of 21st century indigenous Xicanas.  It was a virtual space dedicated to the warrior sisters, hermanas en resistencia, the mamas, the healers, the movers and shakers, las xingonas and yes, the mañosas too.  

Xicana Chronicles has blossomed into a virtual, home-based network collectively helping other wombyn warriors document, digitize, and share their stories with the world.
The Xicana Chronicles project is as an act of resistance and resilience and WITH YOUR HELP we can continue to share our stories in a global and meaningful way.
We need your support to push Xicana Chronicles across the finish line by funding the completion of our first set of FIVE e-books.  
100% of the book sale profits will go to the author, hopefully launching the careers of these wombyn warriors.  This is a win-win!  (A line item budget is included at the bottom of this page.)

We currently have manuscripts for: 

two autobiographical, interactive e-books of Xicana experiences across spiritual, physical, political, legal and personal landscapes; 
a condensed reader and archival compilation of the Mission, Texas environmental justice campaign from the Rio Grande Valley, Texas; 
a compilation of contemporary Xicana Tejana art; and 
the Xica Media story how about using ""rascuacha tech"" can save the world.

We are asking for the support and apoyo of our relatives, friends and networks to help us birth this Xicana-powered and produced inaugural collection of 5 e-books.  
The completion date for this herstorical project is December 2015.

We are part of a generation with an unprecedented amount of power thanks to technology and the internet.  The stories we leave behind are the road maps for the next generation.  For that reason Xicana Chronicles is seeking community support to help push us across the finish line as we publish our first collection of ebooks.
And through a small but powerful collective of Xicana artists and writers that share their perspectives on the site, Xicana Chronicles went viral and global, adding the narrative of indigenous Xicanas to conversations worldwide.  It became part of a virtual codex that can never be burned.  
A lot of the sisters in our community are very powerful but are stuck in the 8-5 grind, working 3-4 jobs to survive, or volunteering in their communities towards positive change while struggling financially.  Many hermanas keep journals, write poetry, do art and document reflections and lessons learned that need to be shared with the world, not just sit stashed away in a journal that can never seem to turn into a book. 
Here's what Acaxochitl had to say:

My Xicana Chronicles Experience
     Writing and sharing my creative works with Xicana Chronicles this last year has shown me that my personal journey can empower Brown women in a direct way.  What I hope to say is an unfiltered view of what it’s like to be Brown, conscious, and living in these times of political strife and racial tensions. 
Xicana Chronicles has given me courage to speak boldly from the heart.
    I am a mother of three and married to an undocumented immigrant. We have our share of struggles as this reality shapes every aspect of our life. For a long time, I felt it best not to speak too openly about our struggle. The stress of it all took its toll on my creative spirit. Through Xicana Chronicles I have found motivation and courage to speak up and to create work that is both healing and inspirational. These are love notes to the universe and to my mixed identity family. Despite our struggle, we are still here, feistier and stronger than before. 
Xicana Chronicles have given me the tools I need to:



Create more positive & spiritually relevant works. 


Remind the world, that we, the children of the sun, are still here, and thriving.


Give voice to those families like mine: Native American and Mexican. Documented and Undocumented. 


Xicana Chronicles has shown me that I am capable of anything. 
    When I was a girl, I would spend hours painting or drawing and I really forgot how much I enjoyed those times. I have truly grown stronger as an artist and mother from the feedback from my sisters across the screens. I realize that my gifts are not to be kept under lock and key. There are no limits to what we, The Xicana Chronicles team, can do.
      I hope that you will consider funding our e-book publishing effort. Help us reach our youth and community worldwide! This is a project made with love and hope for the future, and it is passionately created just for you.
Thank you for reading and sharing our stories.
Sincerely,

Gente! Es una radio novela diaria que trata temas sobre la familia, la
comunidad, el amor y la vida misma. La trama se desarrolla alrededor de las
vidas de varias familias con personalidades e historias peculiares y que viven
en un pueblo culturalmente diverso. 
Cada temporada incluye 65 episodios de 2 minutos de duración con actores profesionales y una reﬂexión breve con la Dra. Alicia La Hoz, Psicóloga Clínica y Directora Ejecutiva de Lazos de Familia. 
Contamos con un
excelente equipo de escritores, productores y actores, que trabajan arduamente
para crear historias que le sorprendan, le entretengan y que a su vez sean educativas.
Nuestra radio novela
es disponible para difusión a radioescuchas
alrededor del mundo vía nuestra página web. Además,
estamos trabajando conjuntamente con más de 600 emisoras en Latino América y Estados
Unidos, para lograr una mayor cobertura de la audiencia hispanoparlante. Nuestra
meta es crear una serie entretenida, que a su vez sea educativa para los
radioescuchas que seguramente podrán identificarse con los diferentes
personajes y sus situaciones, y poder proveerles una reflexión de cómo manejar
las difíciles realidades que se les presentan en la vida diaria, a individuos y
familias – todo con un énfasis en nuestra cultura Latina.
¡Que Gente, Mi Gente! is a daily radio novela about family, community, love and life set inside the comings and goings of a very culturally diversified neighborhood. It includes 65, 2-minute skits with professional actors and reflections with Dr. Alicia La Hoz, author, Executive Director of Family Bridges and Licensed Clinical Psychologist.
We’ve put together a great team of writers, producers and actors. We’ve worked tirelessly to create stories that will surprise, entertain and educate.Our radio novela is available for streaming to listeners anywhere in the world via our website. In addition, we’ve created partnerships with over 600 radio stations in Latin America and the U.S., in order to reach the broadest possible Spanish-speaking audience. Our goal is to create an entertaining but educational series where listeners can identify with the characters and their situations and provide insight on how to handle the difficult realities that we face as individuals and families – all with an emphasis on Latino culture.




Todo inicia con el nombramiento de
Eduardo Bello como el nuevo alcalde del pueblo de Santa Mónica de la Punta
Gorda después de una reñida contienda. Pero son varias las familias que estas
descontentas con la elección de Eduardo Bello como alcalde, incluyendo a las
familias Duarte y Ramos.
Los Bello y los Duarte tienen una riña
familiar que viene desde generaciones pasadas y ahora la polémica se
intensifica a raíz de una relación amorosa entre miembros de su nueva
generación. A este lío familiar se unen otros miembros de la comunidad con sus
propias historias y situaciones que hacen de este lugar uno único y añaden
además un toque especial al drama que se vive en un pueblo pequeño.
It all starts with the induction of Eduardo Bello as mayor of Santa Monica de la Punta Gorda. It was a very tight race and some members of the community are  not happy about his election, including the Duarte family and the Ramos family.
The Bello and Duarte family have a long-lasting family feud that spans a couple of generations and has recently gotten worse due to relationship complications between the younger generations. Intertwined in these stories are members of the community whose lives and stories add to the uniqueness of the neighborhood, as well as to the drama of the small town. 

 



Nuestra meta es recaudar
$50,000. Los fondos recaudados serán utilizados para cubrir gastos de producción
de la 3ra y 4ta temporada de ¡Qué Gente, Mi Gente!
We’re currently looking to raise $50,000. This initial funding will go to producing Season 3  and 4 of ¡Qué Gente, Mi Gente!

We’re thrilled to have reached our
$25,000 goal, and our profoundest thanks go out to the 287 donors that stepped
up before our deadline. This incredible show of generosity blew us away, and we
extend our deepest gratitude to all who contributed. 
When the good people at Indiegogo
suggested we should reignite this campaign, we immediately realized that this
could be a great thing: not only would it allow folks who’d only just heard of
us to contribute, it could be a point of entry for all those good souls wanting
to contribute in their own way to the ongoing business of running a free online
journal with global ambition and reach.
Keeping this page open also allows us
to offer you some of the same awesome perks received by campaign donors: books
autographed by Susan Bernofsky and Reif Larsen, a ""Gateway to Singaporean Literature"" package donated by Singaporean writers Desmond Kon and Christine Chia, and of course our exclusive
AsympTOTE bags, bookmarks, postcards, and posters. 
Run by volunteers and big-hearted
translators, Asymptote needs all the donations it can get,
so, if you like what we’ve been doing, do give what you can in order to keep reading, hearing, and seeing more from us!We Need Diverse Literature! 



We are Asymptote, a truly
international journal presenting the very best literature from all corners of
the globe. 
In a literary world characterized more
and more by a lack of diversity, as well as by an increasingly English-centered
flow of information, we bring more voices—speaking more languages—into an
ever-expanding global conversation. 

Hailing
from 27 countries, our 70 team members collaborate digitally to search
out and commission the finest writing from all corners of the world, with
accompanying artwork, audio and video—all for free. 


Issue after issue, we’ve
brought you never-before-published work by the best writers and translators of
our time. This year alone, Nobel laureates J.M. Coetzee and Herta Müller appeared
alongside 2014 Singapore Literature Prize-winner Amanda Lee Koe and 2013 EU
Prize-winner Faruk Šehić. We’ve conducted exclusive
interviews with acclaimed writers and artists such as Can Xue and Yoshitomo
Nara in their native languages, which
we then translated into English just for our readers. In our four years, we’ve
presented the best stories, essays, poetry, drama, reviews and conversations from
95 countries and 67 languages.
Some Background
Last
year, your overwhelmingly positive support gave us $20,184 to
keep us going. In return, we delivered on our promises and brought you even
more, including: 
•  A clickable map allowing the reader to navigate
our extensive archives by country;
•  A daily blog providing a window into the latest in world
literature; 
•  ‘Close
Approximations,’ our contest for emerging translators,
judged by Eliot Weinberger and Howard Goldblatt, awarding a total of $3,000 in
prize money; 
•  14 events on 4 continents (bringing our
global conversation, for the first time, to Boston, Copenhagen, Hong Kong,
Sydney, Shanghai and Zagreb).It's been a great year, full of excitement, and, despite significant overhead costs, we remain committed to providing our readers unlimited access to our ad-free pages.

Devastated by disease and war, many middle-aged Africans have died, and today over half the population is under 20 years old. Without pastors to shepherd them these young believers go astray, falling captive to destructive ideologies. Without a new generation of wise Christian leaders, their nations will remain trapped in a cycle of suffering and strife.

</div></div>","Short Summary In much of Africa only five percent of Christian churches have a pastor. Devastated by disease and war, many middle-aged Africans have died, and today over half the population is under 20 years old. Without pastors to shepherd them these young believers go astray, falling captive to destructive ideologies. Without a new generation of wise Christian leaders, their nations will remain trapped in a cycle of suffering and strife. Indigenous pastors identified the number one problem in the African church as a lack of leadership training. They joined WILD so they could train the young people of their own nations, rising up pastors and teachers across the continent. With over a million African churches and relatively few to lead, we need help to train leaders for these flocks without shepherds.   What We Need & What You Get Funding is needed for WILD national trainers so they can provide material and discipleship to people who are essentially unable to pay for the teaching.  All donations will help provide training and supplies to churches in need.   The material and teaching curriculum are free, but they need money to make copies to share at seminars, Sunday  schools, youth meetings, and special events.  They also require financial aid for travel costs, as they minister to villages throughout their country.  There can be hours of travel to the next destination.  When seminars are held, people come from great distances to attend.  Sometimes funds are needed to help provide meals and lodging for the participants.  Our African colleagues administer the training, leading their own people into a growing, maturing faith that develops  future leaders for their countries.   All donations are tax-deductible as WILD is federally registered as a 501(c)3 tax-exempt non-profit organization.

<p><b>The Back Story</b></p>
<p>Editor-in-chief Mia Saenz tells you in her own words what prompted her to
start <i>BellaMia Magazine.</i></p>
<p>As a Transformational Love Coach specializing in Self-Love and Body connecting, I’ve worked with thousands of woman who find it difficult to like their own beautiful body.  Let alone to balance and connect the two together within themselves is nearly impossible without help.  The Statistics show that 90% of women do not like their body. That is far too many. <br/></p>
<p>The development of BellaMia magazine was rather magical.  A friend who publishes magazine pointed out I could reach more people by starting a magazine.  This is the beginning of this very rapid journey.  The moment I decided to do this, information poured in quickly on how to do everything, step by step.  It was rather a spiritual experience.  Everyone including the 45 writers and the 5 Editor Directors came forward very fast.  There were more than 100 professionals in their fields wanting to participate with BellaMia but I had to pick and choose who was best for BellaMia.  <br/></p>
<p>BellaMia has a life of it's own and within these pages people fall in love with her.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Why <i>BellaMia</i>?</b></p>
<p>Peruse any grocery store or bookstore and you’ll find women’s magazines
galore. You’ll learn how to lose weight, put on muscle, or instructions for
exactly how you should look to be beautiful. At <i>BellaMia</i>, we believe that <b>all</b>
women are beautiful – just as they are. We embrace your courage and sense of
style, love your curves and your freckles, and think your purple-streaked hair
is awesome. We don’t want you to “tame” your frizzy red tresses or lose 50
pounds, we want you to learn to love the skin you’re in. </p>
<p>We realize that there are other movements out there that want women to see
their own beauty. And we plan to start our own #BeautifulMe campaign with the
August issue. But there is no magazine with that purpose in mind. There is no
place to go for information on how to just be you, no place you can go and ask
experts for self-love, body image, or relationships advice. We know your
struggles. We see you. We are you.</p>

The Back Story
Editor-in-chief Mia Saenz tells you in her own words what prompted her to

As a Transformational Love Coach specializing in Self-Love and Body connecting, I’ve worked with thousands of woman who find it difficult to like their own beautiful body.  Let alone to balance and connect the two together within themselves is nearly impossible without help.  The Statistics show that 90% of women do not like their body.

<h3></h3>
</div><p>(zie de Nederlandse tekst onderaan)</p><h3>Contexte</h3>
<p>Nous pouvons nous féliciter des
lois relatives à la liberté d’expression, liberté de la presse, motivations des
décisions administratives et judiciaires, accès aux dossiers administratifs,
etc. La loi ne peut pas tout régler. Dans certains domaines, le niveau de
transparence dépend de la libre volonté des acteurs politiques. Tel est le cas
des partis politiques. </p>
<p>Nous espérons que la publication
d’une évaluation comparative incitera les partis à améliorer leur niveau de
transparence. La mise en évidence de certaines lacunes (p.ex. opacité des
données financières) pourra alimenter le débat public.</p>
<p>S’il y a fracture entre le monde
politique est les citoyens, la transparence une condition indispensable pour
rétablir la confiance. Les partis sont principalement financés par l'Etat et
par les membres. Les gens trouvent qu'ils ont droit à une grande transparence.</p>
<p>Sans transparence il n’y a pas
de véritable démocratie. Plus le pouvoir est concentré dans les mains des
partis, plus le public est intéressé à ce que les partis soient eux-mêmes
démocratiques, et qu’ils montrent un exemple de transparence.</p>
<p>Nous évaluerons les partis
belges avec au moins un député dans un parlement.</p>
<p>L’institut espagnol  « Fundación Compromiso y
Transparencia » réalise depuis quatre ans une évaluation semblable des
partis politiques espagnols et de leurs fondations. Nous disposons donc de
multiples rapports sur le sujet.</p>
<h3>Objectivité</h3>
<p>La neutralité de l’auteur est
une condition pour la crédibilité de l’enquête. L’enquête sera réalisée en
partenariat : une journaliste francophone, Isabelle Anneet, un journaliste
néerlandophone, Miguel Desnerck, et NousCitoyens. </p>
<p>NousCitoyens prend toute une
série de mesures pour garantir une neutralité vis-à-vis des partis politiques.
Une de ses mesures est la désignation d’une personne-relais dans chaque parti,
dont le nom est publié. </p>
<p>En mai 2014, lors des élections,
NousCitoyens a mis en ligne une première version de son application <a href=""http://www.RepertoirePolitique.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.RepertoirePolitique.be</a> où près de 5000 acteurs
politiques belges sont répertoriés. Parmi ceux-ci, 1500 candidats aux élections
de mai 2014 ont collaboré en remplissant un questionnaire politique (pour le <a href=""http://www.gps-electoral.be/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GPS électoral</a>). Nos projets sont
validés par un <a href=""http://www.wecitizens.be/fr/nous-citoyens/organes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">comité
scientifique</a> composé de professeurs d’université et de journalistes. </p>
<h3>Originalité</h3>
<p>Selon les premières recherches,
il n’existe pas de précédent en Belgique, certainement pas sous forme d’un
‘rating’ des partis politiques. </p>
<p>L’idée d’évaluer la transparence
des partis politiques en intégrant la transparence de leurs mandataires est
totalement inédite, même hors de la Belgique. </p>
<h3>Méthodologie de l’évaluation</h3>
<p>Dans un premier temps on cherche
à quantifier de façon irréfutable la transparence, selon une méthode révisée
par le comité scientifique de NousCitoyens, présidé par le André-Paul Frognier,
professeur émérite de l’UCL en sciences politiques.</p>
<p>On examine trois sources, qui
sont des références en matière de transparence: le site Web du parti, Cumuleo
et le Répertoire Politique de NousCitoyens.</p>
<h2></h2><h3>Le site web du parti</h3>
<p>En terme de communication, la
page Facebook du parti peut être un instrument important, voire plus important,
que le site web officiel du parti. Toutefois, en matière de transparence, nous
considérons que le site web est la référence, et nous limitons notre analyse à
cette source.</p>
<p>Partant d’une
« check-list », on examine le contenu des sites web. Nous comptons, en principe, soumettre aux partis la grille
d’évaluation afin qu’ils puissent réagir s’il y avait eu distraction de notre part. Ceci ne concerne pas l’évaluation finale.</p>
<h2></h2><h3>Cumuleo</h3>
<p>Cumuleo reproduit les listes de
mandats que les mandataires politiques ont l’obligation de déposer auprès de le
Cour des Comptes. Cumuleo a les moyens de constater qui sont les mandataires
défaillants par rapport à deux obligations : dépôt de la liste des mandats,
déclaration de patrimoine. Cumuleo peut donc calculer le % de mandataires de
chaque parti ayant respecté leurs obligations. </p>
<h2></h2><h3>Le Répertoire Politique</h3>
<p>NousCitoyens publie un
répertoire des acteurs politiques. Le répertoire lui-même indique le niveau
d’exhaustivité du profil de chaque acteur politique. Il est donc possible de
calculer la moyenne statistique des mandataires de chaque parti. A terme, il
sera possible de différencier le niveau de transparence dans le profil
proprement dit, et dans les opinions (càd les réponses aux questions
politiques).</p>
<p>Les mandataires politiques
disposent d’un mot de passe pour éditer directement leur profil. Ils contrôlent
directement le niveau d’exhaustivité. L’idée consiste donc à évaluer la transparence
du parti au travers de la transparence de ses mandataires. On se limitera aux
parlementaires et bourgmestres. </p>
<p>NousCitoyens calculera les
statistiques par partis. </p><p></p><h3>A quoi servira la collecte ?</h3>
<p>Le budget couvre
aussi bien l’enquête en Flandres qu’en Belgique francophone.</p><p></p><p>coûts</p><p></p><ul>

<p>-------------------------------------</p><p>(Nederlandse versie)</p><p></p><h3>Context</h3>
<p>We kunnen onszelf gelukkig prijzen met de
bestaande wetten inzake de vrijheid van meningsuiting, persvrijheid, motivaties
van administratieve en gerechtelijke besluiten, toegang tot administratieve
dossiers enzoverder. De wet kan niet alles regelen. In bepaalde domeinen is de
mate van transparantie afhankelijk van de vrije wil van de politici. Dat is het
geval bij politieke partijen. </p>
<p>We hopen dat de publicatie van een
vergelijkende beoordeling de partijen zal aanmoedigen om hun transparantie te
verbeteren. De onthulling van bepaalde tekortkomingen (waaronder de
ondoorzichtigheid van financiële gegevens) zal in het openbaar debat uitgebreid
aan bod komen. </p>
<p>Bij een breuk tussen de politiek en de burgers,
is transparantie een voorwaarde om het vertrouwen te herstellen. De partijen
worden hoofdzakelijk door de Staat en de leden gefinancierd. De mensen vinden
dan ook dat ze recht hebben op transparantie. </p>
<p>Zonder transparantie is er geen echte
democratie. Hoe meer de macht in de handen van de partijen ligt, hoe belangrijker
het voor de bevolking is dat de partijen democratisch zijn en zich transparant
opstellen. </p>
<p>We zullen de Belgische partijen met minstens
één vertegenwoordiger in een parlement beoordelen. </p>
<p>Het Spaanse instituut ‘Fundación Compromiso y Transparencia’ stelt sinds vier jaar een
soortgelijke beoordeling van de Spaanse politieke partijen en hun stichtingen
op. We bezitten dus meerdere rapporten over het onderwerp. </p>
<h3>Objectiviteit</h3>
<p>De neutraliteit van de auteur is een voorwaarde
voor de geloofwaardigheid van het onderzoek. Dat onderzoek zal in samenwerking
tussen de volgende personen worden uitgevoerd: de Franstalige journaliste
Isabelle Anneet, de Nederlandstalige journalist Miguel Desnerck en WijBurgers. </p>
<p>WijBurgers neemt een reeks maatregelen waarmee
ze de neutraliteit tegenover de politieke partijen wil waarborgen. Eén van die
maatregelen is de aanduiding van een tussenpersoon in iedere partij waarvan de
naam wordt gepubliceerd. </p>
<p>Voor de verkiezingen van mei 2014 heeft
WijBurgers een eerste versie van haar toepassing de <a href=""http://directory.wecitizens.be/nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Politieke
Databank</a> online
gezet. Die Politieke Databank bevat ongeveer 5000 politici waarvan er 1500, die
zich in mei 2014 hadden kandidaat gesteld, een politieke vragenlijst hebben
ingevuld (voor de <a href=""http://vote.wecitizens.be/#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kieswijzer</a>). Een <a href=""http://www.wecitizens.be/nl/wie-zijn-wij-2/organen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wetenschappelijk comité</a> van hoogleraars en journalisten bekrachtigt
onze projecten. </p>
<h3>Nieuwheid</h3>
<p>Op het eerste zicht blijkt dat er in België
geen eerder onderzoek naar de beoordeling van politieke partijen werd gedaan. </p>
<p>De idee om de transparantie van de
mandaathebbers te integreren bij de beoordeling van de transparantie van de
politieke partijen, is zelfs buiten België totaal nieuw. </p>
<h3>Methodologie van de
beoordeling</h3>
<p>De transparantie gaan we quantificeren op basis
van een methode die het wetenschappelijk comité van WijBurgers onder leiding
van André-Paul Frognier heeft herzien. Laatstgenoemde is emeritus hoogleraar
aan de UCL in politieke wetenschappen. </p>
<p>We onderzoeken drie bronnen die naar de mate
van transparantie verwijzen: de website van de partij, Cumuleo en de Politieke
Databank van WijBurgers.</p>
<h3>De website van de partij</h3>
<p>Op het gebied van communicatie kan de
Facebookpagina van de partij een belangrijk instrument zijn, zelfs belangrijker
dan haar officiële website. Desondanks zijn wij van mening dat de website de
referentie is en we beperken onze analyse daarom tot die bron. </p>
<p>Vertrekkende van een checklist onderzoeken we
de inhoud van de websites. In principe zijn we van plan om alle partijen het
evaluatierooster voor te leggen zodat zij kunnen reageren in het geval er een
verstrooiing van onze kant is. Dat geldt niet voor de eindbeoordeling.  </p>
<h3>Cumuleo</h3>
<p>Cumuleo reproduceert mandatenlijsten die de
mandatarissen bij de Rekenkamer moeten indienen. Cumuleo heeft de middelen om
mandatarissen die ten opzichte van twee verplichtingen in gebreke zijn
gebleven, te identificeren. Het gaat dan om de indiening van de mandatenlijst
en de vermogensaangifte. Cumuleo kan dus het percentage mandatarissen van
iedere partij berekenen die hun verplichtingen zijn nagekomen. </p>
<h3>WijBurgers</h3>
<p>WijBurgers publiceert een databank van
politici. De databank geeft het volledigheidsniveau van het profiel van iedere
politicus weer. Het is daarom mogelijk om het statistisch gemiddelde van de
mandatarissen van iedere partij te berekenen.</p>
<p>De mandatarissen hebben een wachtwoord waarmee
ze rechtstreeks hun profiel kunnen bewerken. Zij controleren dus direct hun
volledigheidsniveau. De idee is dus dat we de transparantie van de partij
op basis van de transparantie van haar leden zullen beoordelen. We zullen ons echter
tot de parlementsleden en burgemeesters beperken. </p>
<p>WijBurgers zal de statistieken per partij
berekenen. </p>

Nous pouvons nous féliciter des
lois relatives à la liberté d’expression, liberté de la presse, motivations des
décisions administratives et judiciaires, accès aux dossiers administratifs,
etc. La loi ne peut pas tout régler. Dans certains domaines, le niveau de
transparence dépend de la libre volonté des acteurs politiques. Tel est le cas
des partis politiques. 
Nous espérons que la publication
d’une évaluation comparative incitera les partis à améliorer leur niveau de
transparence. La mise en évidence de certaines lacunes (p.ex. opacité des
données financières) pourra alimenter le débat public.
S’il y a fracture entre le monde
politique est les citoyens, la transparence une condition indispensable pour
rétablir la confiance. Les partis sont principalement financés par l'Etat et
par les membres. Les gens trouvent qu'ils ont droit à une grande transparence.
Sans transparence il n’y a pas
de véritable démocratie. Plus le pouvoir est concentré dans les mains des
partis, plus le public est intéressé à ce que les partis soient eux-mêmes
démocratiques, et qu’ils montrent un exemple de transparence.
Nous évaluerons les partis
belges avec au moins un député dans un parlement.
L’institut espagnol  « Fundación Compromiso y
Transparencia » réalise depuis quatre ans une évaluation semblable des
partis politiques espagnols et de leurs fondations. Nous disposons donc de
multiples rapports sur le sujet.
Objectivité
La neutralité de l’auteur est
une condition pour la crédibilité de l’enquête. L’enquête sera réalisée en
partenariat : une journaliste francophone, Isabelle Anneet, un journaliste
néerlandophone, Miguel Desnerck, et NousCitoyens. 
NousCitoyens prend toute une
série de mesures pour garantir une neutralité vis-à-vis des partis politiques.
Une de ses mesures est la désignation d’une personne-relais dans chaque parti,
dont le nom est publié. 
En mai 2014, lors des élections,
NousCitoyens a mis en ligne une première version de son application www.RepertoirePolitique.be où près de 5000 acteurs
politiques belges sont répertoriés. Parmi ceux-ci, 1500 candidats aux élections
de mai 2014 ont collaboré en remplissant un questionnaire politique (pour le GPS électoral). Nos projets sont
validés par un comité
scientifique composé de professeurs d’université et de journalistes. 
Originalité
Selon les premières recherches,
il n’existe pas de précédent en Belgique, certainement pas sous forme d’un
‘rating’ des partis politiques. 
L’idée d’évaluer la transparence
des partis politiques en intégrant la transparence de leurs mandataires est
totalement inédite, même hors de la Belgique. 
Méthodologie de l’évaluation
Dans un premier temps on cherche
à quantifier de façon irréfutable la transparence, selon une méthode révisée
par le comité scientifique de NousCitoyens, présidé par le André-Paul Frognier,
professeur émérite de l’UCL en sciences politiques.
On examine trois sources, qui
sont des références en matière de transparence: le site Web du parti, Cumuleo
et le Répertoire Politique de NousCitoyens.
Le site web du parti
En terme de communication, la
page Facebook du parti peut être un instrument important, voire plus important,
que le site web officiel du parti. Toutefois, en matière de transparence, nous
considérons que le site web est la référence, et nous limitons notre analyse à
cette source.
Partant d’une
« check-list », on examine le contenu des sites web. Nous comptons, en principe, soumettre aux partis la grille
d’évaluation afin qu’ils puissent réagir s’il y avait eu distraction de notre part. Ceci ne concerne pas l’évaluation finale.
Cumuleo
Cumuleo reproduit les listes de
mandats que les mandataires politiques ont l’obligation de déposer auprès de le
Cour des Comptes. Cumuleo a les moyens de constater qui sont les mandataires
défaillants par rapport à deux obligations : dépôt de la liste des mandats,
déclaration de patrimoine. Cumuleo peut donc calculer le % de mandataires de
chaque parti ayant respecté leurs obligations. 
Le Répertoire Politique
NousCitoyens publie un
répertoire des acteurs politiques. Le répertoire lui-même indique le niveau
d’exhaustivité du profil de chaque acteur politique. Il est donc possible de
calculer la moyenne statistique des mandataires de chaque parti. A terme, il
sera possible de différencier le niveau de transparence dans le profil
proprement dit, et dans les opinions (càd les réponses aux questions
politiques).
Les mandataires politiques
disposent d’un mot de passe pour éditer directement leur profil. Ils contrôlent
directement le niveau d’exhaustivité. L’idée consiste donc à évaluer la transparence
du parti au travers de la transparence de ses mandataires. On se limitera aux
parlementaires et bourgmestres. 
NousCitoyens calculera les
statistiques par partis. A quoi servira la collecte ?

-------------------------------------(Nederlandse versie)Context
We kunnen onszelf gelukkig prijzen met de
bestaande wetten inzake de vrijheid van meningsuiting, persvrijheid, motivaties
van administratieve en gerechtelijke besluiten, toegang tot administratieve
dossiers enzoverder. De wet kan niet alles regelen. In bepaalde domeinen is de
mate van transparantie afhankelijk van de vrije wil van de politici. Dat is het
geval bij politieke partijen. 
We hopen dat de publicatie van een
vergelijkende beoordeling de partijen zal aanmoedigen om hun transparantie te
verbeteren. De onthulling van bepaalde tekortkomingen (waaronder de
ondoorzichtigheid van financiële gegevens) zal in het openbaar debat uitgebreid
aan bod komen. 
Bij een breuk tussen de politiek en de burgers,
is transparantie een voorwaarde om het vertrouwen te herstellen. De partijen
worden hoofdzakelijk door de Staat en de leden gefinancierd. De mensen vinden
dan ook dat ze recht hebben op transparantie. 
Zonder transparantie is er geen echte
democratie. Hoe meer de macht in de handen van de partijen ligt, hoe belangrijker
het voor de bevolking is dat de partijen democratisch zijn en zich transparant
opstellen. 
We zullen de Belgische partijen met minstens
één vertegenwoordiger in een parlement beoordelen. 
Het Spaanse instituut ‘Fundación Compromiso y Transparencia’ stelt sinds vier jaar een
soortgelijke beoordeling van de Spaanse politieke partijen en hun stichtingen
op. We bezitten dus meerdere rapporten over het onderwerp. 
Objectiviteit
De neutraliteit van de auteur is een voorwaarde
voor de geloofwaardigheid van het onderzoek. Dat onderzoek zal in samenwerking
tussen de volgende personen worden uitgevoerd: de Franstalige journaliste
Isabelle Anneet, de Nederlandstalige journalist Miguel Desnerck en WijBurgers. 
WijBurgers neemt een reeks maatregelen waarmee
ze de neutraliteit tegenover de politieke partijen wil waarborgen. Eén van die
maatregelen is de aanduiding van een tussenpersoon in iedere partij waarvan de
naam wordt gepubliceerd. 
Voor de verkiezingen van mei 2014 heeft
WijBurgers een eerste versie van haar toepassing de Politieke
Databank online
gezet. Die Politieke Databank bevat ongeveer 5000 politici waarvan er 1500, die
zich in mei 2014 hadden kandidaat gesteld, een politieke vragenlijst hebben
ingevuld (voor de Kieswijzer). Een wetenschappelijk comité van hoogleraars en journalisten bekrachtigt
onze projecten. 
Nieuwheid
Op het eerste zicht blijkt dat er in België
geen eerder onderzoek naar de beoordeling van politieke partijen werd gedaan. 
De idee om de transparantie van de
mandaathebbers te integreren bij de beoordeling van de transparantie van de
politieke partijen, is zelfs buiten België totaal nieuw. 
Methodologie van de
beoordeling
De transparantie gaan we quantificeren op basis
van een methode die het wetenschappelijk comité van WijBurgers onder leiding
van André-Paul Frognier heeft herzien. Laatstgenoemde is emeritus hoogleraar
aan de UCL in politieke wetenschappen. 
We onderzoeken drie bronnen die naar de mate
van transparantie verwijzen: de website van de partij, Cumuleo en de Politieke
Databank van WijBurgers.
De website van de partij
Op het gebied van communicatie kan de
Facebookpagina van de partij een belangrijk instrument zijn, zelfs belangrijker
dan haar officiële website. Desondanks zijn wij van mening dat de website de
referentie is en we beperken onze analyse daarom tot die bron. 
Vertrekkende van een checklist onderzoeken we
de inhoud van de websites. In principe zijn we van plan om alle partijen het
evaluatierooster voor te leggen zodat zij kunnen reageren in het geval er een
verstrooiing van onze kant is. Dat geldt niet voor de eindbeoordeling.  
Cumuleo
Cumuleo reproduceert mandatenlijsten die de
mandatarissen bij de Rekenkamer moeten indienen. Cumuleo heeft de middelen om
mandatarissen die ten opzichte van twee verplichtingen in gebreke zijn
gebleven, te identificeren. Het gaat dan om de indiening van de mandatenlijst
en de vermogensaangifte. Cumuleo kan dus het percentage mandatarissen van

Crear un nuevo periodismo para América Latina

Nos gustan las historias con final feliz. Creemos en un periodismo serio y riguroso basado en historias y relatos con un marcado componente humano.  Un periodismo reposado atento a los detalles, a la trastienda de la noticia.

Las experiencias de estos emprendedores o el dinámico ecosistema de Startups en América Latina generan importantes oportunidades entre Canadá y las Américas, y PanamericanWorld es el puente que las conecta.

originales con un apoyo audiovisual más eficaz.

<p>Thank You for visiting my Indiegogo
campaign page. My name is Chris Coad Taylor.</p>
<p>    What is the <i>Ordinary Heroes-Voices of History</i> book project? The concept is
simple. It has been over seventy years since the end of World War II and we are
losing the opportunity to speak first-hand with the veterans and their families.
My publishing company is documenting the personal accounts direct from the
people who lived during this time. Although, we don’t want to make another
history book with dates and battles to memorize, what we aim to achieve is a
book of personal and engaging stories of the people. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><em>   </em><strong>Why is it important to the community?</strong> Our purpose is to have a book that will connect the younger
generation with the past so that yours and my children, and the grandchildren can
understand the world of the past. History books do not transport the readers
into the lives of the people and the world of the past. Personal accounts of
the atmosphere and feelings of the time gives the readers knowledge of a world
different from theirs. This connection will allow our children and
their children to “never forget” what our veterans and families sacrificed
go many years ago for them.</p>
<p>   <strong>How can you help?
</strong>Any and all of your support is appreciated and needed. The the
success of this massive project relies on many elements. Pledges start as low as
<em><em><em>$15.00</em></em></em>.The more money we collect the further our reach will go in
presenting and sharing the book. </p>
<p>   If a money pledge is not possible
than you can still help. We need everyone to get the word out about this
project. Share our campaign on Facebook or tell your friends in person about
our project. Support honors our veterans and shares a part of our country’s
history that is rare to find. </p>
</div>
<p><i>   <strong>My inspiration to compile stories</strong></i> of the wartime days came from my father, who was a WWII
veteran. Mother was an inspiration, too. Like many at home during WWII she
worked to support the war effort. Both my parents passed away at a young age,
never seeing my children grow up. This left a hole in the family, a broken
link to the past. The opportunity to ask my father about those times is lost,
but through the sharing of stories from others, the opportunity to link to the past
will be saved.</p><p>

Through the <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Ordinary Heroes-Voice of History</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> book

That fruit contains seeds of it’s own that will produce more trees. After enough time it will produce a forest. </p><p>          My vision is to plant this seed in the correct soil and watch it achieve it’s maximum potential.

Little did he know one of the pages of that journal contained a drawing that would render his life changed forever. What he saw, in that moment, set him on course for the most reckless and profound experience of his life.""A little about the book:Here’s what I’ve been telling everyone.         If you are familiar with the parable of the prodigal son, this is my revision of it with added characters and sub-plots that take place modern day.         The dialogue is easy to understand and the pages are not too many. Throw in a little sarcasm and romance (just don't mix the two) and you've got yourself a book worth reading. ~Simple~You’ll never look at your own life the same, when you read this book.        The parable of the prodigal son holds certain profound truths. In this book, I perfectly express my understanding of these truths. Every character, every situation and every last detail is an actual piece of my life. My past and my future, all concocted into one deliciously orchestrated parable. Call to action: (Seeds to forests)          A seed always starts small, but we already know what happens to a seed when it is planted in the right soil; it grows into what it’s meant to grow into. When this seed (book) grows into the tree it’s meant to be, it WILL produce fruit. The best part is that it doesn’t have to stop there. That fruit contains seeds of it’s own that will produce more trees. After enough time it will produce a forest.           My vision is to plant this seed in the correct soil and watch it achieve it’s maximum potential. Once this becomes a physical book, I promise to not stop there. I will do everything I can to take it to the next level and I will rely on God to do the rest. This is the perfect opportunity for you to invest into this potential.           Let me tell you about what I am doing now, and what you can do now, to see this seed grow. My campaign goal is to raise $5,000/30 days. The money raised will be used to complete the book, copyright it, publish it, and get it in your hands.

<p>Hi, I’m
Glen Martin. I need your help to help millions of children around the world. The
future of our planet is in the hands of our children and grandchildren and how
the future unfolds depends on how they are parented and educated today.  </p>
<p>In America
I worked 78 hours a week as a child therapist seeing children who were on multiply
psychiatric medications. Utilizing a wholistic approach that included parenting
classes and medical supervision over 99% of these children were successfully
tapered off all of their meds.  I wanted
to help as many children as possible and I finally realized no matter how many
hours I worked millions of children were and are still being prescribed psychiatric
medications because of inappropriate parenting.</p>
<p>So after I closed
down my clinic and came to India to write the definitive parenting book. There
is no agreement between the parenting experts. The conservative parenting
experts claim that liberal parenting spoils children and the liberal parenting
experts claim that conservative parenting traumatize them and they are both
correct in their assumptions. When I was growing up children were more often
traumatized and now they are much more likely to be spoiled. So I decided I
would look at parenting historically, developmentally, culturally, religiously,
biologically and from every relevant domain I could think of to resolve this
dilemma. I thought it would have taken me two or three years to write this book
but instead it took me ten years of intensive research and living in various
cultures around the world. </p>
<p>While
triangulating these various domains an all-encompassing paradigm of paradigms emerged.
Conscious Template is a grand unifying paradigm that explains the disagreements
within any domain and the commonality between domains. </p>
<p>Conscious
template is the Rosetta Stone of paradigms and the Holy Grail of philosophers
and scholars. By overlaying this grand unifying model insights, truths and errors
are revealed within any theoretical model. Conscious Template will help you better
understand not only parenting but relationships, psychology, politics, religions,
science, business, cultures, education and history as well. Conscious Template
is a paradigm shift that integrates all domains and explains the differences and
the similarities within any domain.</p>
<p>Earth will some day be in the hands of our
children and proper parenting and education now are the two most important variables
for the optimal outcome of mankind later. Help me help millions of children and
learn how to be the best parent or teacher you can possibly be. This
information is literally priceless. It will change your life, the lives of your
loved ones and the world. </p><h3>Funding Needs</h3><p>I would like to invite you to support this project in it's launching phase. The books are completed and the next step now is to raise enough money to publish them. Funds will be used for publishing the books and to build a website where I can sell present and future titles as well as interact with readers. </p><p>I offer unique perks to my campaign supporters, including counselling sessions with me on Skype. This is a rare opportunity since I stopped seeing individual clients years ago and now mostly do workshops and lectures. Check out the perks in the sidebar. </p><p>Help me spread the word about this campaign and use the Indiegogo share tools to let your friends know about this project! </p><p>Thank you so much for helping me make these books a reality.</p><p>Yours Sincerely,</p><p>Glen Martin</p><p><br/></p></div>","Conscious Template

<p>     Howrah Train Station has 21 platforms and handles hundreds of trains and over one million passengers daily. There are a massive number of children who live in the station and under the platforms. Many of the children are addicted to sniffing glue and drugs. Physical and sexual abuse are every day events in their lives.<br/></p>
<p>     Your contributions will go to help reach, restore, and reconnect the children of the Howrah Train Station with their families and reintegrate them into society by providing a rescue home as an alternate environment to teach them healthy ways to live, Children's lives are transformed through biblical teaching, education, sports, and practical help.<br/></p>
<p>     Frontline Kids exists to help meet needs of children at risk all
 over the world. Tom and Cristy George, founders of Frontline Kids were 
each widowed immediately after their children were born. The Lord showed
 them HIS heart when their  kids were motherless and fatherless, and 
they desire to do the same for the street kids of Kolkata, India, where 
they spent their honeymoon after the Lord united their families.
</p>
<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>     We would like to raise $12,300 to support their immediate needs for one year as defined below:<br/></p>
<p>-Approximately $47 per child x 15 = $700 per month<br/>
</p>
<p>     The above amount includes rent for the project house, maintenance, utilities, medical needs, and educational material. Food needs are already being covered by Frontline Kids.<br/>
</p>
<p>-Missionary support to Indian family that care for the boys = $325 per month<br/></p>     We would like to raise an additional $10, 000 to go towards the following additional needs. Any excess will be applied specifically to the following--clothing, musical instruments, project vehicle, camera, sew machine, their own land for gardening. All funds will be applied to this project whether or not the goal is met.<br/>     For all gifts over $25, please accept a copy of our book, ""Under the Shadow of the Almighty"", a story of beauty from ashes and healing from grief, from which the Lord birthed Frontline Kids.<br/><br/><h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>     Becoming a partner with Frontline Kids is a wise investment that will change children's lives who, otherwise, would continue to live without love or hope. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>     Since 2012 many children have been returned to parents, delivered from 
drug addictions, learned to read and write, learned job skills, and most
 importantly made Jesus Christ their Lord. Of course, this comes through much effort and prayer, and some children leave before their transformation is complete. However, the love of God compels us to continue in faith, helping those who will let us.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help<br/>

     Howrah Train Station has 21 platforms and handles hundreds of trains and over one million passengers daily. There are a massive number of children who live in the station and under the platforms. Many of the children are addicted to sniffing glue and drugs. Physical and sexual abuse are every day events in their lives.
     Your contributions will go to help reach, restore, and reconnect the children of the Howrah Train Station with their families and reintegrate them into society by providing a rescue home as an alternate environment to teach them healthy ways to live, Children's lives are transformed through biblical teaching, education, sports, and practical help.
     Frontline Kids exists to help meet needs of children at risk all
 over the world. Tom and Cristy George, founders of Frontline Kids were 
each widowed immediately after their children were born. The Lord showed
 them HIS heart when their  kids were motherless and fatherless, and 
they desire to do the same for the street kids of Kolkata, India, where 
they spent their honeymoon after the Lord united their families.

 
  What We Need & What You Get      We would like to raise $12,300 to support their immediate needs for one year as defined below:
-Approximately $47 per child x 15 = $700 per month

     The above amount includes rent for the project house, maintenance, utilities, medical needs, and educational material. Food needs are already being covered by Frontline Kids.

-Missionary support to Indian family that care for the boys = $325 per month     We would like to raise an additional $10, 000 to go towards the following additional needs. Any excess will be applied specifically to the following--clothing, musical instruments, project vehicle, camera, sew machine, their own land for gardening. All funds will be applied to this project whether or not the goal is met.     For all gifts over $25, please accept a copy of our book, ""Under the Shadow of the Almighty"", a story of beauty from ashes and healing from grief, from which the Lord birthed Frontline Kids.The Impact
     Becoming a partner with Frontline Kids is a wise investment that will change children's lives who, otherwise, would continue to live without love or hope. 
  Risks & Challenges     Since 2012 many children have been returned to parents, delivered from 
drug addictions, learned to read and write, learned job skills, and most
 importantly made Jesus Christ their Lord. Of course, this comes through much effort and prayer, and some children leave before their transformation is complete. However, the love of God compels us to continue in faith, helping those who will let us.
  Other Ways You Can Help

<p>We are a publishing company driven by a higher purpose - the desire to make a difference within the social empowerment ecosystem. As a literacy-based social entrepreneurship, we pursue a two-fold agenda that are mutually complementary:</p>
<p><strong>1. Empowering orphans in developing countries to take charge of their future through literacy initiates, by establishing resource centers or libraries in their orphanages. To this end, we donate $1 for every book sold, to establish such libraries. Also, 25% of proceeds from this campaign will go directly into the orphanage library project.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Just because someone is an orphan right now in a developing world doesn’t mean their future has to be limited too. We believe in the power of books and literacy initiatives to inspire these orphans to dream and aspire towards a better future. We are currently completing two projects in West Africa - reaching about 700 orphans. Our goal is to complete five of such projects each year. Your support makes that possible. Watch this inspiring 1-minute video, to understand what drives us at Kharis Publishing regarding these amazing kids. </p>

<p><strong>2. Giving voice to underrepresented authors – women, minorities, internationals, and first-time authors – by publishing their books in the USA, absolutely free.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Just because someone doesn't have a big platform or national name-recognition doesn't mean his or her voice shouldn't be heard. We believe everyone deserves to tell their story, free of charge, irrespective of name recognition, financial ability, or big platform. We provide full traditional publishing benefits for underrepresented authors, namely, fully vetted acquisition processes, professional editing, design, production, and distribution. Absolutely no charge to the author at any stage. If you have something important and original to say, you will have the full benefit of a professional publishing house. You don't have to spend a fortune or be preyed upon by vanity presses just to publish your book. Plus, we offer our authors 40% flat royalty rate on net receipts. No secret negotiations. What you earn doesn’t have to depend on your negotiation skill, but rather on actual book sales. Please visit our website for more details: <a href=""https://www.kharispublishing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.kharispublishing.com</a> .

<p style=""text-align: center;"">“My inspiration to write a book came through my love to write and the need to tell my story. My life became hard. I found myself drowning in suicidal depression. I bottled all my emotions inside of me. When I broke open and all my emotions came pouring out, I found writing helped the most. My book ‘Discovering True Love’ was born. The hardest part was writing about my mistakes and going into depth of why I became suicidal. As a Christian, I felt like a failure. After a few years of playing with my manuscript, I decided to see if a publisher would accept my work. I heard from a few other authors that this process could take a while and I could be denied several times before I would get accepted. I began my search. I had no money, no phone, and no idea what I was doing. All I knew was I needed an old fashion publishing company… I sent Kharis Publishing my manuscript. Kharis Publishing accepted me. I’ve had a blast and so much fun working with the editor Kharis Publishing assigned me. I was new and learned as we went. They were very patient with me. It’s been fun getting to know my editor and I loved the comments she would put on my manuscript when she looked over my work. I encourage other writers to also send Kharis Publishing their manuscripts because they have helped me to bring out the beauty of my story. They have helped me transform my 'caterpillar-of-a-manuscript' into a beautiful colorful butterfly. I hope my book will help others to find hope and true love...”</p>

<p>We know that our publishing model is unique and disruptive in some ways within the current publishing ecosystem. For it to succeed, the direct partnership and support of friends and supporters like you is essential. Here are three ways you can be a part of this social venture:</p>
<p>1.  Contribute to the cause and help launch our authors forward. Any amount will do:  $10, $25, $50, $100 or $150. Our partners and supporters are called <strong>Kharis &amp; Friends</strong>; a group of individual supporters and friends who care enough about social empowerment to do something about it, together. Your contribution today qualifies you as a Kharis &amp; Friends member, with all benefits. Click here to learn more about <strong>Kharis &amp; Friends</strong>: <a href=""https://www.kharispublishing.com/kharis-friends/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.kharispublishing.com/kharis-friends/</a>. </p>
<p>2. The second level of support is simply buying books from Kharis Publishing. Every time you buy a Kharis published book, you are helping in two ways: First, we donate $1 from each book sale directly to build libraries for orphanages; every single book, every single time. It adds up pretty fast. Second, each book purchased supports and empowers an author. Every book you select during this campaign serves as a sale for that author. Our authors receive 40% flat royalty on net receipts from such sales, based on the retail price. Please watch this 1-minute video that shows the difference that $1 can make.</p>
<p> </p>

<div> </div>
<p>3. The third area of support is in shipping these books and computers abroad. Shipping books overseas is very expensive; on average about $3.65 per pound. Your donation today helps immensely in getting these books and computers to the orphanages. 25% of proceeds from this campaign have been earmarked to acquire and ship resources overseas. Here are some books and computers currently awaiting shipment to a recipient orphanage in Accra, Ghana.</p>

1.  Contribute to the cause and help launch our authors forward. Any amount will do:  $10, $25, $50, $100 or $150. Our partners and supporters are called Kharis & Friends; a group of individual supporters and friends who care enough about social empowerment to do something about it, together. Your contribution today qualifies you as a Kharis & Friends member, with all benefits. Click here to learn more about Kharis & Friends: https://www.kharispublishing.com/kharis-friends/. 
2. The second level of support is simply buying books from Kharis Publishing. Every time you buy a Kharis published book, you are helping in two ways: First, we donate $1 from each book sale directly to build libraries for orphanages; every single book, every single time. It adds up pretty fast. Second, each book purchased supports and empowers an author. Every book you select during this campaign serves as a sale for that author. Our authors receive 40% flat royalty on net receipts from such sales, based on the retail price. Please watch this 1-minute video that shows the difference that $1 can make.
 

 
3. The third area of support is in shipping these books and computers abroad. Shipping books overseas is very expensive; on average about $3.65 per pound. Your donation today helps immensely in getting these books and computers to the orphanages. 25% of proceeds from this campaign have been earmarked to acquire and ship resources overseas. Here are some books and computers currently awaiting shipment to a recipient orphanage in Accra, Ghana.

Offers for printed books are only for contributors within the United States of America. People residing outside USA will receive only digital versions of the books.3. Finally, please let us know of the book(s) of your choice so we can get them sent to you. Even if you forget, we will follow up to make sure that you get just the right book. Browse Away!",32.0,3,"1 Campaign

Hi, and thank you for visiting! A little history: Back in 2007 as a professional book designer, I had clients who had written several books but couldn't afford to pay for custom cover design. So I set out to hire a development team and create BookCoverPro—Book cover design software expressly developed for creating affordable, high-quality, professional covers. BookCoverPro has since helped thousands of writers all over the world create their own stunning cover designs for print books and ebooks. Shortly after, PrintMarketingPro was developed for creating book marketing materials as an affordable alternative to other desktop publishing programs.

 

BookCoverPro interface + cover examples:

Over the years, we've received many kudos... Here are a few:

""I want to say that the bookcoverpro is brilliant and I like it very much."" —Kelvin Edokpolo, Bigedo International UG
""...Love this program. Very easy and intuitive to use.” —Judy McFarlen
""Hi Angie, I received the cd today, and I wish to thank you for all of your help. The program is amazing.” —Randy Belaire  
""BookCoverPro Team, Thank you for your excellence, leadership, and client focus. The covers for 3 editions of Psalms of Fern are all beautiful....Thanks again, I appreciate it."" —R. Girard Tournesol

""As a self-publisher, BookCoverPro is my favorite purchase, love it! P.S. Plus I am saving hundreds of dollars.” —Bernie Malonson
 ""BCP is an excellent program. I found it to be very easy and intuitive with which to work; and has the capability to produce highly professional-looking dust jackets in a short time.  You are only limited by your own creativity."" —Anthony Marolda, winbridgegroup.com



Now, my partners and I would like to extend our vision of helping independent writers and small publishers by taking our existing programs, improve upon them, add interior page design—and combine everything into one power-packed software mega-package: BookCreative.


Introducing our New Product: BookCreative™ Software
BookCreative is a plug+go program that includes everything needed for a stunning, sophisticated, professional book: Create full cover designs, format and design pages, and build a variety of promotional materials, all in one. Each feature of BookCreative is designed to work harmoniously together to ensure a professionally created book, consistent in its overall look and marketing. Robust, yet still very easy and fun to use, BookCreative can be used in its entirety or only for what is needed - cover, page formatting, or marketing. Choose to convert your finished piece from several formats, ready for submission to your printer.
Here are the basics of BookCreative:

What We Need:


We need funding for BookCreative's program development. Having this amount upfront keeps our overhead costs low so we can pass along the savings.

How Much Will It Cost?
We plan to offer this program either as an outright purchase for $247, or as a subscription for $10/month. However, preordering through this campaign will be significantly lower – see perks!



Where The Money Goes:

We will be hiring a development team to take on our project where it has left off: Improve and enhance upon it, add the interior page design component, give it a fun, easy interface, and combine everything into one powerful package. This is not a small request, so after an exhaustive interview process, we have finally found the right team to handle the job—and also handle my crazy idea whims. With development comes quality assurance to ensure functionality, and that includes a lot of testing. The amount we ask covers the following:



Software development



Q/A process - testing, testing.... and more testing



Indiegogo fees


We estimate product completion and launch in October-November 2016, and at that time will be contacting everyone who contributed $10 or more to deliver their program or reserve their memberships.

 But... {gasp} What if we don't meet our goal?


That will be very sad indeed... :(( But we are prepared to use whatever we have to improve upon our existing programs. I promise, your contributions will be put to good use!

 However, if we exceed our amount....


Get ready for some awesome stretch goals! We have some amazing rewards planned, like professional editing and marketing services.... exclusive book promotions with airlines (yep, we know people).... day spa retreats.... and so much more! Stay tuned.

 Oh yeah! I almost forgot...
