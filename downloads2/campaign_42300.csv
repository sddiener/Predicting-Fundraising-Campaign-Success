<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQs</h2>
<p><strong><span>Does ORA require a subscription and what do I get for it?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Yes, a subscription is required for your ORA to work properly and it is $14.99 per month or $149.95 per year. All perks come with 3 months subscription included. We recommend you also consider purchasing a year in advance at a discount - that's another exclusive perk here on Indiegogo!  </span></p>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How is ORA different than medical alert or PERS devices?</strong></p>
<p>There are many reasons why ORA is different, besides how great it looks! Firstly, traditional devices typically only work in the home and yard, whereas ORA works wherever there is cellular coverage. In addition, the alerts go to your network of friends and family, instead of a stranger in a call center. Your network also has access to a dashboard of information on their app, including connection details and inactivity, something other devices do not have. Finally, when you purchase ORA, it is yours to keep and the monthly subscription is very competitive. There are no contracts or hidden fees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How does the donation perk work - how do you decide who gets an ORA?</strong></p>
<p>For every $120 raised from the ""Help Someone in Need"" perk, an ORA Flex package, along with $120 in subscription (for a full 12 months coverage), will be donated to someone in need. We will be reaching out to the ORA community for nominations on individuals who should be considered. From those nominations, we will select deserving recipients. Want to nominate someone? Send us a message at support@oraforyou.com.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do I need an ORA Link for each piece of jewelry? </strong> </p>
<p><span xml:lang=""EN-US"">Nope. You only need one ORA Link, and you can swap it in and out of every piece of ORA compatible jewelry and sportswear. The Flex is great for everyday wear, including sleeping, bathing, and exercising, and then you can change to the Teardrop when you want to dress up.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span xml:lang=""EN-US""><strong>Does ORA have fall detection?</strong></span></p>
<p><span xml:lang=""EN-US"">Fall detection is currently not a feature of ORA. Our research indicated that automatic fall detection is largely unreliable, and the feedback from older adults from our focus groups reinforced this. Those who owned devices with automatic fall detection told us there were many times when they didn't fall but the device went off, which was not only annoying for them and their loved ones, it also caused them to not want to wear the device. This is the worst possible scenario, since wearables are only useful if people wear them! </span></p>
<p><span xml:lang=""EN-US"">Instead, ORA offers 'inactivity monitoring'. With a quick check in the ORA App, the support network can see if the wearer is wearing ORA, if it is charged and connected, and if the wearer has moved or has been inactive for extended periods. If you see the wearer hasn't moved in a while, this could be an indication you should give them a call.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span xml:lang=""EN-US""><strong>Do I need a smartphone?</strong></span></p>
<p><span xml:lang=""EN-US"">Yes, the ORA Link pairs</span> with a compatible smartphone that has an active cellular and data connection. The support network contacts do not require a smartphone, however if a regular cell phone is used, only texts will be received as the other features (notifications, GPS location, inactivity) can only be accessed through the ORA App.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span xml:lang=""EN-US""><strong>How long does the battery last?</strong></span></p>
<p><span xml:lang=""EN-US"">Your ORA Link will last a full 24 hours (depending on usage) before needing to be recharged. You should charge your ORA every day or night, just like your smartphone. ORA can't help you in an emergency if your Link or smartphone are not charged! It should only take a couple hours to charge your Link. You’ll know it’s fully charged by the solid green light on your Link. </span>The simple magnetic charger is included with your purchase of any ORA package.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is there a warranty?</strong></p>
<p>We offer a one-year warranty for the Link. Please email <a href=""mailto:support@oraforyou.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@oraforyou.com</a> if you would like a copy of our warranty policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who can be included in the support network?</strong></p>
<p>You determine who you would like to notify, and you can add as many people as you want. You invite them to be a contact, and they would download the ORA app.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can my phone alert 911? Does it still work if I have an iPhone and it is in sleep state or locked?</strong></p>
<p>After you signal an alert, if you do not receive and answer a phone call within that 2 minutes, your Link will instruct your phone to call 911. Our patent pending system follows protocol which will unlock an iPhone in sleep state. As long as your phone is in range and charged, 911 will be called at the end of the countdown, even if your phone has a passcode and is locked.</p>
<p>This is a major benefit of ORA compared to our competitors. Look closely at their messaging; it is common for them to hide in the fine print that your phone must be unlocked, or that <strong>your loved ones</strong> need to call 911. Unfortunately, that isn't optimal. Emergency services have systems to find you if you use your phone to call 911, so ORA follows how 911 emergency services actually works. ORA has also been tested with a large North American 911 provider. It works!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What if I press the button accidentally?</strong></p>
<p>We've designed the Link to make it difficult to press the button by accident. The button is indented so you can feel where the button is, but makes it harder to accidentally press. However, if you do press it by accident, it's simple to cancel it: just go into the ORA app and press the ‘Cancel’ button. Your support network will be notified that you cancelled the alert. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I pair one ORA Link to two smartphones?</strong></p>
<p>Each ORA Link is paired to only one smartphone. If you need to, you can reconnect to a different smartphone. For more details about this, send us a message at support@oraforyou.com.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What kind of notifications does the system send?</strong></p>
<p>The network receives a Push Notification in the ORA app (or a text message to a non-smartphone  phone number) and their phone will emit an emergency sound. The wearer’s ORA will vibrate aggressively, blink red and their phone will also emit an emergency sound.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How I can be sure it doesn’t track my location all the time?</strong></p>
<p>Your privacy is our highest priority. ORA only tracks your location when you press the button, and shares your location information only with those contacts you have added to your support network. We respect your right to privacy and treat your personal information with strict confidentiality. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will you ship internationally?</strong></p>
<p>ORA is currently certified for sale in Canada and the United States and is shipped from Canada. With a successful Indiegogo campaign we will seek to certify ORA in other countries. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How close does my phone need to be to ORA?</strong></p>
<p>Since the device uses Bluetooth technology, your ORA Link and phone will need to be within range (20-30 feet) of each other to ensure you can send alerts and transmit data. This range depends on your specific circumstances, like phone model and the building you are in. In general, it is best to keep your ORA and smartphone with you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What happens if my phone shuts down or loses power?</strong></p>
<p><span xml:lang=""EN-US"">ORA requires that the ORA app is running on your phone in order to work properly. If your phone is turned off or runs out of battery charge, your ORA will not work.</span> </p>
<p> </p>

Since ORA communicates through the ORA smartphone app, you are protected wherever there is cell phone coverage, with any cellular carrier. Whether you’re out for a walk, shopping, or out with friends, you’re protected by ORA. ORA even works when you are travelling, in any country with 911 emergency services.

FAQs
Does ORA require a subscription and what do I get for it?
Yes, a subscription is required for your ORA to work properly and it is $14.99 per month or $149.95 per year. All perks come with 3 months subscription included. We recommend you also consider purchasing a year in advance at a discount - that's another exclusive perk here on Indiegogo!  
Subscriptions includes: 


Unlimited Alerts 


Unlimited number of emergency contacts 


Patent pending 911 emergency response 


ORA low battery indicator 


Inactivity tracking reporting 

Chat function for support network members

 
How is ORA different than medical alert or PERS devices?
There are many reasons why ORA is different, besides how great it looks! Firstly, traditional devices typically only work in the home and yard, whereas ORA works wherever there is cellular coverage. In addition, the alerts go to your network of friends and family, instead of a stranger in a call center. Your network also has access to a dashboard of information on their app, including connection details and inactivity, something other devices do not have. Finally, when you purchase ORA, it is yours to keep and the monthly subscription is very competitive. There are no contracts or hidden fees.
 
How does the donation perk work - how do you decide who gets an ORA?
For every $120 raised from the ""Help Someone in Need"" perk, an ORA Flex package, along with $120 in subscription (for a full 12 months coverage), will be donated to someone in need. We will be reaching out to the ORA community for nominations on individuals who should be considered. From those nominations, we will select deserving recipients. Want to nominate someone? Send us a message at support@oraforyou.com.
 
Do I need an ORA Link for each piece of jewelry?  
Nope. You only need one ORA Link, and you can swap it in and out of every piece of ORA compatible jewelry and sportswear. The Flex is great for everyday wear, including sleeping, bathing, and exercising, and then you can change to the Teardrop when you want to dress up.
 
Does ORA have fall detection?
Fall detection is currently not a feature of ORA. Our research indicated that automatic fall detection is largely unreliable, and the feedback from older adults from our focus groups reinforced this. Those who owned devices with automatic fall detection told us there were many times when they didn't fall but the device went off, which was not only annoying for them and their loved ones, it also caused them to not want to wear the device. This is the worst possible scenario, since wearables are only useful if people wear them! 
Instead, ORA offers 'inactivity monitoring'. With a quick check in the ORA App, the support network can see if the wearer is wearing ORA, if it is charged and connected, and if the wearer has moved or has been inactive for extended periods. If you see the wearer hasn't moved in a while, this could be an indication you should give them a call.
 
Do I need a smartphone?
Yes, the ORA Link pairs with a compatible smartphone that has an active cellular and data connection. The support network contacts do not require a smartphone, however if a regular cell phone is used, only texts will be received as the other features (notifications, GPS location, inactivity) can only be accessed through the ORA App.
 
How long does the battery last?
Your ORA Link will last a full 24 hours (depending on usage) before needing to be recharged. You should charge your ORA every day or night, just like your smartphone. ORA can't help you in an emergency if your Link or smartphone are not charged! It should only take a couple hours to charge your Link. You’ll know it’s fully charged by the solid green light on your Link. The simple magnetic charger is included with your purchase of any ORA package.
 
Is there a warranty?
We offer a one-year warranty for the Link. Please email support@oraforyou.com if you would like a copy of our warranty policy.
 
Who can be included in the support network?
You determine who you would like to notify, and you can add as many people as you want. You invite them to be a contact, and they would download the ORA app.  
 
How can my phone alert 911? Does it still work if I have an iPhone and it is in sleep state or locked?
After you signal an alert, if you do not receive and answer a phone call within that 2 minutes, your Link will instruct your phone to call 911. Our patent pending system follows protocol which will unlock an iPhone in sleep state. As long as your phone is in range and charged, 911 will be called at the end of the countdown, even if your phone has a passcode and is locked.
This is a major benefit of ORA compared to our competitors. Look closely at their messaging; it is common for them to hide in the fine print that your phone must be unlocked, or that your loved ones need to call 911. Unfortunately, that isn't optimal. Emergency services have systems to find you if you use your phone to call 911, so ORA follows how 911 emergency services actually works. ORA has also been tested with a large North American 911 provider. It works!
 
What if I press the button accidentally?
We've designed the Link to make it difficult to press the button by accident. The button is indented so you can feel where the button is, but makes it harder to accidentally press. However, if you do press it by accident, it's simple to cancel it: just go into the ORA app and press the ‘Cancel’ button. Your support network will be notified that you cancelled the alert. 
 
Can I pair one ORA Link to two smartphones?
Each ORA Link is paired to only one smartphone. If you need to, you can reconnect to a different smartphone. For more details about this, send us a message at support@oraforyou.com.
 
What kind of notifications does the system send?
The network receives a Push Notification in the ORA app (or a text message to a non-smartphone  phone number) and their phone will emit an emergency sound. The wearer’s ORA will vibrate aggressively, blink red and their phone will also emit an emergency sound.
 
How I can be sure it doesn’t track my location all the time?
Your privacy is our highest priority. ORA only tracks your location when you press the button, and shares your location information only with those contacts you have added to your support network. We respect your right to privacy and treat your personal information with strict confidentiality. 
 
Will you ship internationally?
ORA is currently certified for sale in Canada and the United States and is shipped from Canada. With a successful Indiegogo campaign we will seek to certify ORA in other countries. 
 
How close does my phone need to be to ORA?
Since the device uses Bluetooth technology, your ORA Link and phone will need to be within range (20-30 feet) of each other to ensure you can send alerts and transmit data. This range depends on your specific circumstances, like phone model and the building you are in. In general, it is best to keep your ORA and smartphone with you.
 
What happens if my phone shuts down or loses power?
ORA requires that the ORA app is running on your phone in order to work properly. If your phone is turned off or runs out of battery charge, your ORA will not work.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Inspiration</h3>
<p>We've all been there at some point in our lives - that dreadful moment of not knowing what to wear to an interview to make the best impression. A first summer job. An internship. Or our first ""real"" job after college.</p>
<p>Picking an outfit is just as important as the interview itself, because, let's face it, first impressions do matter. But the right outfit can be expensive. A professional, not see-through, white blouse can easily be $50, and a lined, fitted skirt and blouse combo can easily go over $150.</p>
<p>But what if you don't have a couple hundred bucks just sitting there waiting to be spent? </p>
<p>Well, you're then faced with only 2 options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a cheap outfit that will really only last you that one time you wear it but doesn't look as professional as you'd like it to (and can you really make the best first impression with this?)</li>
<li>Recycle what you have (but what if you don't have anything remotely professional to start off with?)</li>
</ol>
<p>We get it. We've both been there many times and faced the struggle. </p>
<p>It is very difficult and frustrating to find something that is appropriate, that's not overly expensive, and that fits right, especially when you need it right there and then (and can't possibly sit around waiting for a miraculous sale that happens to still have the size you need in stock). </p>
<p><strong>And that is why we came up Suit &amp; Simple, a place where you can get the outfit that you need, right when you need it - all for under $100.</strong></p>
<p>We have carefully designed each piece that embodies comfort, versatility &amp; professionalism. Plus, we have made sure to design garments that not only can be worn on the workforce, but that are versatile enough to be worn on different settings.</p>
<p><i><strong>At the end of the day, we want to make sure you are getting the best for every cent you invest. Help us raise the funds we need to meet our minimum order requirements and place our first order!</strong></i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">We have what it takes</h3>
<p>We come from a background of finance and fashion, and together with your help, we believe that we have what it takes to turn our vision for Suit &amp; Simple into a reality!  Join us in our mission to make professional womenswear more affordable.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">How is it possible for us to price our suit set at a level where other retailers don't? </span></h3>
<p>Well, there are three key components:</p>
<p><strong>1. We've taken it back to the basics</strong></p>
<p>We've decided to produce only a single line consisting of one blouse, one blazer, and one skirt. This allows us to more effectively manage our inventory.  We are able to minimize our overhead costs because we don't have to worrying about having overstock in a style that isn't as popular and becomes dead inventory that takes up space. By going simple and back to the basics, we can more efficiently manage our capital, and this also makes it easier for us to project our inventory needs and place more accurate orders. </p>
<p>But this also means that we designed our garments very carefully in order to ensure that it fits all body types. </p>
<p><strong>2. We sell directly to you</strong></p>
<p>By selling directly to you, our customers, we take out the middle man from the equation. This ensures that you don't receive a product that is marked up twice! By only having an e-commerce store, we can also eliminate the added costs that come with having a brick and mortar store.</p>
<p><strong>3. We care more about making suits more affordable for you than in making a profit</strong></p>
<p>For us, Suit &amp; Simple is more than just a business. It's a way for us to make a difference and empower young women by making it possible for them to dress their best and succeed. Rather than marking up our garments several times cost as is common in the fashion retail industry, we're more committed to ensuring that young women can afford the outfit they need to succeed. It's a personal mission for us.</p>
<p>It's taken us months to find the right manufacture, the perfect design, and the high quality fabrics that works for us - but now we're ready to launch. And we need your help to do it!</p>

We have developed a good relationship with our manufacturer and have been promised a manufacturing time of ~a month for the order. There could be unforeseen delays in manufacturing that would be out of our control.  Similarly, we've been told that shipping will take ~2 weeks, but there is always the possibility of unforeseen delays. Therefore, to stick to the safe side, we have allocated 2.5 months from the end of the campaign to when you will receive your rewards! Shipping is open to the U.S & Canada only.
Sizing
We have carefully designed each and every garment to have the best fit. For our customers' convenience we have created a measurement chart for our three garments to help you determine which size will fit you the best. We currently offer sizes: Small, Medium, Large and Extra Large.
***Each and every backer that picks up any perk with our garments will receive an email once the campaign is over to determine which size will be sent to you.***
 

 

 
Stretching Our Goals
If we raise over $20,000, we will expand our mini collection with more colors and prints. Exited to see that, help us by donating!

<p><b>Indiegogo</b> is introducing the '<b>Guardian X 2</b>' 'GX2' for short. A
comfortable active ware shirt. Made of spandex, polyester, and cotton featuring
anti-microbial and moisture whicking technologies. You'll enjoy having fun
mixing, function, versatility, and customization in a way we feel no hooded
shirt has done before. </p>

Like many startups and innovations... it all
starts with an '<b>idea</b>' some are fleeting some not so fleeting, you shrug
them off whimsically, but then there are the ideas that linger. They grab a
hold of you in a way that's consuming. They even haunt your dreams begging for
the chance to be made real. The '<b>GX2</b>' is that idea! This flagship design

<p><b>Why the hoodie</b>? The history of the hood is a long one dating back to the
early <i>1200's</i>. It gives an aura of mystery and a sense of purpose to its
wearer, at the same time providing protection from the elements. This is what
makes the hoodie the perfect blend for my design. It's the designs simplicity
that makes it appealing to both male and female wearers. </p>
<p>The idea actually started way back
in the <i>90's</i> without my knowing it. In my little league and high school
football days my brother and I we would turn our under shirts into half shirts
or sometimes cutting our sleeves off. With the forgiveness from our mom of
course. We did this as an adolescent attempt to show off our athletic physique
impressing our teammates and the cheerleaders. This highlighted the fruits of
all our practice and hard work. Seemingly there was actually a functional
component about doing this that we didn't fully understand. We were able to
move better our bodies were able stay cooler and frankly it just looked <b>cool</b>.
As the years progressed I would see other kids doing the same thing my brother
and I did all those years prior. It got me thinking... being that we are visual
in nature as human beings. We like to show off our hard work in gyms or out in
public. So why not create something that anyone can wear regardless of body
type and size that would do just that. Something that motivates and at the same
time builds confidence. This was the birth of the <b>GX2</b> guardian times 2.
Two pieces, a long sleeved shirt and a drawstring hood that can be attached and
detached at will to suit the wearers’ style or use. </p>
<p>This leaves you with one final
question. ""<b>How will you wear your guardian</b>""?</p>

 I know because I've looked, searched and practically turned the world 
upside down 
to find them. I've spoken with others who have looked in vain as well 
and, like me, have ended up having to buy a suit for a girl that is 
fitted for a boy. Visit any retail outlet and the only fancy options for
 girls are dresses or skirts. While a lot of girls love dresses (both 
for fancy and 
not-so-fancy occasions), an alternative is sorely needed because not all
 girls want to wear a dress. Lots of girls 
like suits, tuxes and ties. Many parents have sent me photos of their 
girls dressed in suits, but they are always boys' suits. Women wear 
suits and it is not only acceptable, but stylish. Why can't little 
girls? They should not have to wear a suit that is broad in the 
shoulders, short in the arms and baggy in the pants. In short, they 
shouldn't have to wear a suit that isn't tailored for their bodies. 
That's where <b>SUIT HER</b> enters.</p></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption><figcaption>
<p><b><i>The Indiegogo campaign's goal is to begin the process of creating and manufacturing these amazing suits. </i></b><b><i>The initial funding will cover the 
costs of full designs, patterns and prototypes for each suit. This is the first crucial step toward manufacturing them.</i></b></p>
<b></b><p>Once we are
 able to have the physical suits in hand, we will offer 
pre-ordering/sales which will determine production. <br/></p>

<p><b>With your help, the majority of the funds raised will go toward the actual prototypes for all pieces for each suit which is the first step in the process. </b>This includes full designs, fabrics/materials, patterns and sewing of the three different suit option which include a jacket and three bottoms.

<p>In addition, if we surpass our goal we hope to put it toward the actual manufacturing of the suits as well as marketing/advertising and updating our website.<br/></p>
<p>Initially, the suits will retail for approximately $149 which includes a jacket and bottom of choice. The suits will be made to last--with high quality materials and details. All products will be manufactured here in the United States.</p>
<h1>Timeline</h1>
<p>Once the campaign has ended, it will take approximately five months to get from sketches/designs to final prototypes. There are many steps in between to finalize details and make sure the suits will be everything we want them to be. I will maintain communication as to the timeline and what is happening at every step along the way. Our focus is on a high-quality product with attention to detail. We will offer pre-ordering/sales as soon as we have samples and sizing in hand.  Manufacturing the initial run will take approximately six months:</p>

At age 
three, she began to make her own choices about the clothing she wanted 
to wear. She did not like pink and she did not like sparkles. She liked 
bright and bold colors. She liked things not found in typical girls' 
departments. </figure><p></p>
<p>Back in 2010, when she was five, she wanted to wear a
 tuxedo to her violin recital. She always loved ties - especially bow 
ties. From a very young age she wanted a tuxedo. She would say, ""Mom, I 
want a tornado!"" [sic] We searched and searched and couldn't find one 
for girls...so we bought her a boy's tux. She wore it proudly with her 
black and white Jordan high-top sneaks and her (then) long hair pulled 
back in a ponytail. Since then, she has opted to wear suits for many 
occasions.</p>
<p></p>

<i>My girl at five in a tux and Jordan high tops!</i><p></p>
<p>In 2008, I found myself unemployed due to layoffs during the recession. I decided to pursue my passion for providing non-stereotyped clothing and toy options for girls like my daughter, so I sold my wedding ring to get started and created the <a href=""http://www.princessfreezone.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Princess Free Zone</a> brand, blog and website. I knew that my daughter could not be the only girl who preferred non-princess, non-pink, non-glittery clothing, but rather race cars, building toys, and super heroes. And come to find out - I was right.</p>
<p>My goal has always been to create a clothing line for girls that offers ALL girls more choice in how they express themselves. After all, <a href=""http://www.princessfreezone.com/options/page.asp?id=18"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">if they're not seeing alternatives to princess and pink, they can't choose something different;</a> and many do not even consider going to boys' aisles or departments. And why should they have to? </p>
<p>Princess Free Zone has been producing fun, hip t-shirts for girls since 2009, including designs like a dinosaur riding a scooter, an octopus with a mustache, and a crab made of tools.

</div></div>","KIDS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE BRAVE TO WEAR CLOTHES THEY LIKE!SUIT HER will offer hip, unique, ready-to-wear suits for girls age five 
to twelve that are full of fun detail and made to fit a girl's 
body. They will be high-quality suits with hand-picked fabrics and lots 
of attention to detail and fit. Finally! Girls will be able to choose a 
suit made just for them.( Check out my appearance on CNN's HLN talking about SUIT HER!)The SUIT HER Collection by PFZOur initial collection will offer three different looks: The General She (casual), The Classic She (semi-formal), and The She-She (formal). Each jacket can be paired with a bottom of choice (pants, shorts, or skirt). This provides several styles to accommodate a girl's personal taste in a variety of circumstances, from casual to dressy. Below are the specific designs for each suit in the collection:""She-She"" - SUIT HER by PFZThe She-She is exactly as it sounds...a high-end look for any formal occasion. Wear it with a skirt, pants, or shorts depending on the event. The bright red buttons and satin details will blow everyone away!""Classic She"" - SUIT HER by PFZThe Classic She is that classic suit look, but with unique details like burlap elbow patches and dark purple satin trim around the pockets. This look is strikingly fashion-forward with our crisp, white button-down shirt and tie of choice. (Tie pictured is a dinosaur silkscreen pattern by Cyberoptix Tie Lab.)""General She"" - SUIT HER by PFZThe General She is a fun take on the military look, featuring army green cotton twill fabric, gold metallic buttons, and a star on the back of the jacket. Also included are several detachable epaulets for added color and flair.In addition, we will also offer ties to go along with the Classic Suit option. Our ties are colorful and fun! WHY SUITS FOR GIRLSSuits for girls are completely missing in the mainstream apparel market.
 I know because I've looked, searched and practically turned the world 
upside down 
to find them. I've spoken with others who have looked in vain as well 
and, like me, have ended up having to buy a suit for a girl that is 
fitted for a boy. Visit any retail outlet and the only fancy options for
 girls are dresses or skirts. While a lot of girls love dresses (both 
for fancy and 
not-so-fancy occasions), an alternative is sorely needed because not all
 girls want to wear a dress. Lots of girls 
like suits, tuxes and ties. Many parents have sent me photos of their 
girls dressed in suits, but they are always boys' suits. Women wear 
suits and it is not only acceptable, but stylish. Why can't little 
girls? They should not have to wear a suit that is broad in the 
shoulders, short in the arms and baggy in the pants. In short, they 
shouldn't have to wear a suit that isn't tailored for their bodies. 
That's where SUIT HER enters.
The Indiegogo campaign's goal is to begin the process of creating and manufacturing these amazing suits. The initial funding will cover the 
costs of full designs, patterns and prototypes for each suit. This is the first crucial step toward manufacturing them.
Once we are
 able to have the physical suits in hand, we will offer 
pre-ordering/sales which will determine production. 



Janelle Monae looking fabulous in her suit and saddle shoes.Our Team: Fashion Designer & Manufacturer  Karen Patwa - PFZ's fashion designer
I have hired fashion designer Karen Patwa, who KNOWS suits because she's been custom creating them for women for years. You can see some of her work on her website Dangerous Mathematicians. Her background in physics is not only cool, but also mission-aligned with the PFZ brand and SUIT HER's stereotype-busting approach to girls' apparel. She has already drawn up these amazing designs which will be turned into the prototypes.

Julie Hutton - Owner/Manufacturer Julie Hutton, Inc. 
For manufacturing needs, I'll be working with the woman-owned manufacturing company Julie Hutton, Inc., based in New York City. Julie has been in the business for twenty years and her ""Personal Label"" division specifically helps the budding designer navigate the process of clothing design from beginning to end, ensuring a successful result. Her company uses six different factories right in Manhattan. To that end, I am happy to say that once we go into production all of our products will be made in the USA.

Where will the funds go?
With your help, the majority of the funds raised will go toward the actual prototypes for all pieces for each suit which is the first step in the process. This includes full designs, fabrics/materials, patterns and sewing of the three different suit option which include a jacket and three bottoms. We will use a standard model to fit the prototype and ensure proper sizing. The remainder will go toward marketing, website and photography costs.


Funding for SUIT HER

In addition, if we surpass our goal we hope to put it toward the actual manufacturing of the suits as well as marketing/advertising and updating our website.
Initially, the suits will retail for approximately $149 which includes a jacket and bottom of choice. The suits will be made to last--with high quality materials and details. All products will be manufactured here in the United States.
Timeline
Once the campaign has ended, it will take approximately five months to get from sketches/designs to final prototypes. There are many steps in between to finalize details and make sure the suits will be everything we want them to be. I will maintain communication as to the timeline and what is happening at every step along the way. Our focus is on a high-quality product with attention to detail. We will offer pre-ordering/sales as soon as we have samples and sizing in hand.  Manufacturing the initial run will take approximately six months:
Timeline
Phase I


Aug - Sept: launch SUIT HER 30 day campaign

Sept 2016 - Jan 2017: five months to produce physical prototypes/samples of suits 

Jan 2017: update campaign with photos and samples of suits

Phase II

Jan - June 2017: begin to take orders and go into full production and manufacturing
June/July 2017 - ship orders

It is no small endeavor to produce and manufacture three unique suits with different pieces which is why I am doing this project in phases. I want to be sure I can accomplish each phase thoroughly and with attention to the details that will make these suits special.
**Please note that if we raise beyond our goal and begin production of suits earlier, we will shorten this timeline.**

Actual girls wearing suits. We want to give them suits made for them! #GirlsWearSuits #SharpDressedGirl #SuitHerMy BackgroundMy story begins with my daughter who is now eleven years old. At age 
three, she began to make her own choices about the clothing she wanted 
to wear. She did not like pink and she did not like sparkles. She liked 
bright and bold colors. She liked things not found in typical girls' 
departments. 
Back in 2010, when she was five, she wanted to wear a
 tuxedo to her violin recital. She always loved ties - especially bow 
ties. From a very young age she wanted a tuxedo. She would say, ""Mom, I 
want a tornado!"" [sic] We searched and searched and couldn't find one 
for girls...so we bought her a boy's tux. She wore it proudly with her 
black and white Jordan high-top sneaks and her (then) long hair pulled 
back in a ponytail. Since then, she has opted to wear suits for many 
occasions.


My girl at five in a tux and Jordan high tops!
In 2008, I found myself unemployed due to layoffs during the recession. I decided to pursue my passion for providing non-stereotyped clothing and toy options for girls like my daughter, so I sold my wedding ring to get started and created the Princess Free Zone brand, blog and website. I knew that my daughter could not be the only girl who preferred non-princess, non-pink, non-glittery clothing, but rather race cars, building toys, and super heroes. And come to find out - I was right.
My goal has always been to create a clothing line for girls that offers ALL girls more choice in how they express themselves. After all, if they're not seeing alternatives to princess and pink, they can't choose something different; and many do not even consider going to boys' aisles or departments. And why should they have to? 
Princess Free Zone has been producing fun, hip t-shirts for girls since 2009, including designs like a dinosaur riding a scooter, an octopus with a mustache, and a crab made of tools. In addition, we've introduced a line of gender-equal tees featuring the phrase ""SHOW YOUR COOL"" for both girls and boys.

I also wrote and published a children's book called ""Super TooLula: The Kind Warrior"" which features a young phenom named Lula who has her own tool belt and helps her dad with carpentry projects. She uses her super hero gifts and magical tools to protect and come to the aid of kids who are mistreated or bullied. 
Through my website, blog, and social media, I have learned that there are countless girls who aren't being recognized or respected in the mostly pink-and-princess departments. Behind them are supportive parents and relatives looking for more choices, who don't want their girls limited by what big companies decide is for girls. I've worked hard for six years not only to provide alternatives for kids, but to build community and engage in a conversation around gender identity and stereotypes so that I could be a part of the change I wanted for my daughter and, ultimately, all girls.
Recently PFZ was featured on The Huffington Post as one of ""12 Brilliant Kids' Clothing Lines That Say No To Gender Stereotypes."" I've also been a guest on CNN's HLN speaking to princess culture and how girls particularly are bombarded with messages that deplete their self-esteem, body image and confidence.

<h3>A lack of options</h3>
<p>Co-founder Nora started surfing again last year and discovered surf wear didn't exist above a size XL, and those XLs were few and far between and anything but flattering. An avid yoga practitioner, she also lamented she had limited options in yoga leggings, despite being the most common size in the USA.  Asking around for suggestions among her like-sized friends, she quickly found there weren't a lot of options. Baggy sweatpants for yoga and male board-shorts for surfing slipped off or pinched in the wrong areas. </p>
<p>On a surf trip to Costa Rica, the idea for 124 West was born.</p>
<p>By helping fund 124 West, you are helping women have access to athletic wear they can feel good in. Your contribution will help us get our first production run out as well as expand our offerings so women, no matter what their size, can feel comfortable in what they're wearing. Yoga and surfing are for all bodies, and we want to show the world that.</p>

<p>There are 5 items available in the first run, all available in XXS-4X:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Scylla </strong>- our reversible multiple-use top. Scylla is solid colored on one side and a print on the other. Scylla ties in the back, can be twisted if you need a tighter fit, and on many bodies can be pulled up or down over the hips instead of overhead. Scylla works well as a cropped top for yoga class and as a swim top for catching waves or just chilling by the pool.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Charybdis</strong> - our high-waist swim bottom. Charybdis has a high waist band that won't slip when swimming or surfing, ruching to hide anything you want hidden, and can be folded down if you want more skin to show.</p>

<p>4. <strong>Ceto</strong> - our full length leggings. A warning- Ceto was designed with a 5'11"" friend in mind as well as friends who like to pull their leggings over their heels, so you will find our leggings are longer than what's offered on the market now. Ceto conveniently has a pocket on the right side that is large enough to hold a phone and/or wallet</p>
<p>5. <strong>Echidna</strong>- our cropped leggings on those 5'5"" and taller, but regular length on anyone shorter. Echidna is a cropped version of her mother Ceto, and both are designed to be worn to yoga class and then into the ocean to catch some waves.</p>

<h3>Where does funding go? What perks are available?</h3>

This includes fabric purchases, fabric printing, manufacturing, compostable-bags to hold product, boxes for shipping, marketing expenses, new design tech packs and samples, grading to expand size offerings, and any other odds and ends. Manufacturing items using only recycled goods and making them in the United States is costly, but your funding goes toward an eco-conscious and ethical choice as full USA manufacturing cuts out any chance of child labor or sweatshop production.</p>

<h3>Where we are in this journey</h3>
<p>We have just returned from a week in Costa Rica with our group of 124 West Warriors sizes XS-2X gathering fit information. The last week of November 124 West will be working onsite with our manufacturing team making all the changes we discovered we needed to make.

<h3>Why is what 124 West is offering so important?</h3>
<p><strong>Fact</strong>: More than half of the women in the United States are a size 14 or higher.</p>
<p>Despite this, there are very few options for flattering and attractive athletic-wear for women size 14 or higher. This is a 1/4th of the market in the USA, but it is ignored. In an age where we are constantly barraged by what 'ideal beauty' is, anyone outside of that range is given clothing options to hide themselves instead of express themselves. 124 West wants everyone to feel beautiful and comfortable whether they're running a marathon or marathoning their favorite tv show. </p>
<p>Plus, our leggings have pockets!</p>
<p>Furthermore, 124 West is dedicated to giving back, and part of our future profits will go toward cleaning the ocean. Clean waters are important to us, and the fabric we have chosen is made from ghost nets found in the ocean. With your help, 124 West seeks to better the oceans through educational campaigns and funding organizations helping protect our marine environments. </p>

<p>We wanted ikiki shoes to be more than just another pair of
shoes or booties, and you and your child will get that feeling the moment the
box arrives. The box is made from earth friendly, recyclable materials and
you’ll be able to open it without needing to grab knives or scissors. Inside
the box you’ll not only find your ikiki friends, but you’ll also have a
colorfully designed insert that will tell you more about the character and the
animal that character was based on.</p>
<p>This extra level of detail not only makes ikiki a great
product for parents, it’s also a great gift idea. ikiki booties are a great
gift for baby showers and both the shoes and the booties are an excellent gift
to give to nieces and nephews. </p>

<p>If you love the ikiki friends but your little one isn't big enough to need shoes yet, don't worry, we have all of the ikiki characters available in booties as well as in shoes. The booties don't squeak, but they are made from super soft material that caresses your baby's feet. And the strong, but gentle elastic around the ankle guarantees that the booties will stay on, even during play time. <br/></p>

<p>Learning to walk is tough, or so I've heard... As a sea dweller I haven't really had a chance to try my flipper at it (Man, maybe I'm not a good shoe spokescritter after all).

<p>Squeaking everywhere you go can be more fun than a ball of yarn, but there are times when all that squeaking isn't helpful. I have a feeling mice everywhere would rest a little easier if I squeaked everywhere I went. Fortunately, ikiki shoes have the purrrfect solution: a special squeaker that turns on and off with the flip of a switch!</p>

<p>I love humans and baby humans and smelling things and toys! Oh yes, I love toys! Especially ones with squeakers! ikiki shoes have built-in squeakers that make every step a ball! And when you have a ball you can throw it and I can catch it and then you can throw it again and I can catch it again over and over. Squeakers aren't just fun though. When you squeak with every step, it's easier to keep on stepping!</p>

We will post an update soon on how you can pick your sizes and characters. Otherwise we'll send you to a form where you can choose the sizes and characters you want once the campaign has ended.Most adults totally take walking for granted. Talking to one of them you’d think that walking was the easiest thing in the world. Well, it’s a different story for toddlers. In fact, learning to walk can be downright scary. At ikiki, we don’t think walking should be scary, it should be fun.Virtually all kid shoes are just adult shoes, only smaller.
But kids' feet are different than adult feet, so the shoes should be different
too. That’s why we started from the ground up to reimagine kids’ shoes. We’ve
searched long and hard to find the best materials for a breathable,
comfortable, and fun shoe for kids that will help them learn to walk.Other than the comfortable feel and kid-focused design, what really sets ikiki shoes apart is our patent-pending adjustable squeaker in the sole of each shoe. Not only will your little one get a kick out of the fun noise, squeaking shoes have been recommended by physical therapists and pediatricians to help kids learn to walk and reinforce good walking habits. There are other
squeaker shoes out there, but you can’t turn off the squeaker without taking
the whole thing out which, to us, seemed like a choking hazard waiting to
happen. That’s why we made a squeaker that can be turned on or off with the flip of a
switch.

Our fun and innovative squeaker makes ikiki shoes perfect for crawlers learning to walk, kids learning to take proper heel-to-toe steps, or anyone who wants walking to be exciting.





And with four charming animal characters, and more on the way, these shoes are more like a wearable toy than just a shoe. Finally, a shoe that kids won’t want to take off!



“…my daughter is walking SO much more confidently, and she jumped last week. She has always been scared to even try. She’s increased her speed, flexibility, and confidence by 3000%. It’s a different kid! That squeak is so much more than knowing where my daughter is, or a cute little attention getter . . . it’s peace of mind . . . you guys have changed our lives!”
-Stormy G.

“I love the squeaky shoes for when we go out, not only for the
cute look but also because I always hear where my daughter is.”
-Emma Rain

“I no longer have to battle getting shoes on my son’s feet! The
first day he wore his new ikiki shoes he wouldn’t let me take them off. He even
took his nap with his new Narwhal friends . . . I also like having the versatility
of turning the squeak on and off so easily and not losing the noisemaker. I
love these shoes!”
-Trish O.











We wanted ikiki shoes to be more than just another pair of
shoes or booties, and you and your child will get that feeling the moment the
box arrives. The box is made from earth friendly, recyclable materials and
you’ll be able to open it without needing to grab knives or scissors. Inside
the box you’ll not only find your ikiki friends, but you’ll also have a
colorfully designed insert that will tell you more about the character and the
animal that character was based on.
This extra level of detail not only makes ikiki a great
product for parents, it’s also a great gift idea. ikiki booties are a great
gift for baby showers and both the shoes and the booties are an excellent gift
to give to nieces and nephews. 











If you love the ikiki friends but your little one isn't big enough to need shoes yet, don't worry, we have all of the ikiki characters available in booties as well as in shoes. The booties don't squeak, but they are made from super soft material that caresses your baby's feet. And the strong, but gentle elastic around the ankle guarantees that the booties will stay on, even during play time. 












Learning to walk is tough, or so I've heard... As a sea dweller I haven't really had a chance to try my flipper at it (Man, maybe I'm not a good shoe spokescritter after all). If I was a land mammal like you though, I'd want a pair of ikiki squeaky shoes. You can't beat shoes that double as fun friends to hang out with all day! I'd never take them off!





Squeaking everywhere you go can be more fun than a ball of yarn, but there are times when all that squeaking isn't helpful. I have a feeling mice everywhere would rest a little easier if I squeaked everywhere I went. Fortunately, ikiki shoes have the purrrfect solution: a special squeaker that turns on and off with the flip of a switch!





I love humans and baby humans and smelling things and toys! Oh yes, I love toys! Especially ones with squeakers! ikiki shoes have built-in squeakers that make every step a ball! And when you have a ball you can throw it and I can catch it and then you can throw it again and I can catch it again over and over. Squeakers aren't just fun though.

<p>Imagine a world where girls are free from negative messaging and proud of their unique contributions. How girls see themselves is vital to their well-being and success. We believe that exposing girls to positive affirmations about themselves is critical to building self-esteem and ultimately a joyful, fulfilling life. 'Words are powerful and what girls say about themselves can change their course.' <i>(IALAC WORLD artist Rachel)  </i></p>
<div>It is well known that girls around the world suffer from low self-esteem. The statistics that prove this point are staggering.  <ul>
<li>Once low self-esteem is formed negative messages permeate every thought and result in self-defeating behavior.</li>
<li>Of girls ages 15-17, 70% avoid normal daily activities as a result of feeling badly about their looks.</li>
<li>In college aged girls, 80% claim that their poor body image is linked to the negative remarks made by friends and family.</li>
<li>75% of girls with low self-esteem versus 25% of girls with high self esteem engage in negative activities like cutting, bullying, smoking, drinking and disordered eating. </li>
<li>7 in 10 girls believe that they are not good enough or don't measure up in some way, including looks, performance in school and relationships with friends and family. </li>
</ul>
<div>
<span><p>From IALAC WORLD Founder Charmaine Winslow:</p></span><h3>IALAC WORLD was conceived from my own passion to elevate positive thinking and empower not only my own kids, but young women around the globe with tools needed to help them be confident and strong. </h3>
</div>
</div>
<p>I made a commitment to follow my passion.  I asked myself, what if I create a company in which its sole purpose is to empower young women by showcasing their own art and affirmations on really cool clothing and accessories?  I knew immediately that my efforts would draw upon the acronym, IALAC (I Am Loveable and Capable), which was coined 25 years ago by world-renowned professor of education, Dr. Sidney B. Simon.  With my sights firmly set, IALAC WORLD was conceived. </p>
<div>
<p>IALAC WORLD will highlight the talents of young, out-of-the-box thinkers from around the world who specialize in fashion design, visual arts, photography, videography and social media.  These young artists will help to coalesce a movement of positivity and self-affirmation that is sorely lacking in today’s society. Many tee-shirt and accessory companies are marketing messages of insolence:  “You Can’t Sit With Us,” “Live Fast, Die Young,” and “Good Girl Gone Bad” just to name a few.  IALAC WORLD will cut from the pack and fill the void that exists in the apparel market.  Our tees are inspiring AND creative AND catchy AND cool! <i>Gratitude is My Attitude, I Am the Change I See in the World, and I am Free to Live My Dreams – </i>just to name a few.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I am equally as passionate about reaping what I sow.  IALAC WORLD will be a <i>giving</i> company.  Our efforts will prioritize giving visual and performing arts grants to less fortunate children around the globe who want to pursue their own artistic dreams and talents.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">How do we work? </b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">Girls love clothing and accessories. We will satisfy their desire for more than just trendy fashion but rather clothing and accessories that make them feel good about themselves while appealing to a greater cause.</span></p>

Imagine a world where girls are free from negative messaging and proud of their unique contributions. How girls see themselves is vital to their well-being and success. We believe that exposing girls to positive affirmations about themselves is critical to building self-esteem and ultimately a joyful, fulfilling life. 'Words are powerful and what girls say about themselves can change their course.' (IALAC WORLD artist Rachel)  
It is well known that girls around the world suffer from low self-esteem. The statistics that prove this point are staggering.  
Once low self-esteem is formed negative messages permeate every thought and result in self-defeating behavior.
Of girls ages 15-17, 70% avoid normal daily activities as a result of feeling badly about their looks.
In college aged girls, 80% claim that their poor body image is linked to the negative remarks made by friends and family.
75% of girls with low self-esteem versus 25% of girls with high self esteem engage in negative activities like cutting, bullying, smoking, drinking and disordered eating. 
7 in 10 girls believe that they are not good enough or don't measure up in some way, including looks, performance in school and relationships with friends and family. 


From IALAC WORLD Founder Charmaine Winslow:IALAC WORLD was conceived from my own passion to elevate positive thinking and empower not only my own kids, but young women around the globe with tools needed to help them be confident and strong. 


I made a commitment to follow my passion.  I asked myself, what if I create a company in which its sole purpose is to empower young women by showcasing their own art and affirmations on really cool clothing and accessories?  I knew immediately that my efforts would draw upon the acronym, IALAC (I Am Loveable and Capable), which was coined 25 years ago by world-renowned professor of education, Dr. Sidney B. Simon.  With my sights firmly set, IALAC WORLD was conceived. 

IALAC WORLD will highlight the talents of young, out-of-the-box thinkers from around the world who specialize in fashion design, visual arts, photography, videography and social media.  These young artists will help to coalesce a movement of positivity and self-affirmation that is sorely lacking in today’s society. Many tee-shirt and accessory companies are marketing messages of insolence:  “You Can’t Sit With Us,” “Live Fast, Die Young,” and “Good Girl Gone Bad” just to name a few.  IALAC WORLD will cut from the pack and fill the void that exists in the apparel market.  Our tees are inspiring AND creative AND catchy AND cool! Gratitude is My Attitude, I Am the Change I See in the World, and I am Free to Live My Dreams – just to name a few.
Last but not least, I am equally as passionate about reaping what I sow.  IALAC WORLD will be a giving company.  Our efforts will prioritize giving visual and performing arts grants to less fortunate children around the globe who want to pursue their own artistic dreams and talents.
How do we work? 
Girls love clothing and accessories. We will satisfy their desire for more than just trendy fashion but rather clothing and accessories that make them feel good about themselves while appealing to a greater cause.


Our hip apparel is sourced from manufacturers in Los Angeles that treat their employees with dignity; thus, the name IALAC WORLD Dignity Threads.  
Young artists from around the globe submit artwork via our website or social media to be selected for the IALAC WORLD clothing and accessory line.
We then print positive affirmations and artwork designed by young artists on trendy shirts, pants, jackets, bags and accessories that will appeal to young women based on beta market research done amongst young women.
Girls connect with IALAC WORLD's positivity via interactive social media platforms and our website to build brand awareness through advocate and influencer marketing. The power of positive peer influence cannot be underestimated and for this reason IALAC WORLD will disseminate its messaging to  young women leveraging their ability to positively influence themselves and their peers.
The outcome…girls elevate positivity by wearing their affirmation-art-apparel and accessories like a badge of honor to empower not only themselves but girls around them.

quickly. It only comes in one color, a rich chocolate with some burgundy and
purple hues. It is the lightest weight leather we offer.</p>
<p><b>Bison</b> is a medium weight water buffalo leather coming
from Italy. Because of its protective coat and finer grain, it scratches and

<p><b>Longhorn</b> is a beefier and heavier cowhide coming from
Brazil. As the leather is stitched and worked, its hue lightens slightly,
giving it a worn character. It has a heavier grain and lighter protective coat,

</h3><div><blockquote>Soft, smooth, and beautiful!  <br/><b>- Comedian, Maz Jobrani</b><br/><br/>This is not only the nicest bag I have ever owned, but also the the nicest bag I've ever seen!  <br/><b>- Paula's husband</b><br/><br/>These bags are HOT! So unique and well-made. They make the best gift. Jared absolutely digs his and uses it all the time!   <br/><b>- Nora Cohen</b><br/><br/>I couldn't be happier with my Saintly All American. I have been searching for the perfect bag for years, As an avid traveler, a self proclaimed adventure capitalist, I needed something that would last, that looked great, and most importantly, something personal. All my experiences, all my travels, carry a deep meaning to me. It was extremely important that I had more than just a bag. I wanted something unique. When I first came across Saintly, I knew I found exactly what I was looking for. The attention to detail, the story behind the brand, the ability to completely customize my new travel companion made the experience that much more greater. I will carry my All American proudly with me on all my travels, spreading the ideals and values of the brand I've grown so fond of. Life is adventure. Be prepared.  <br/><b>- Mike Rutledge</b><br/><br/>I do many 3 and 4 day trips all over the US and Europe for work and personal.  My Saintly custom bag is awesome and I get many compliments on it.  It's a perfect compliment with a suite and tie or jeans and t-shirt for travel!   <br/><b>- Kevin Adams</b><br/><br/>I ordered the Weekender edition in black with burnt orange interior and nickel hardware with rush delivery as I needed it before some upcoming travel. The bag turned out just as I ordered and right on time. The quality of this bag is amazing – definitely worth the money – and something you would see at twice the price. The fact that I was able to customize it to my specifics was great. Don’t hesitate – get one now, you won’t regret it. Customer service was great too – I had confirmation and follow-up almost immediately.   <br/><b>- Tom Schager</b><br/><br/>I purchased a bag for my husband, knowing that he would love the high quality leather.  The added bonus of being able to customize and add pockets was a  huge selling point because he travels a lot and hates having his shoes and dirty clothes in the same compartment as his clean clothes. When the bag arrived, the quality of the craftsmanship far exceeded our expectations because it was obvious that a great deal of time and attention went into constructing the bag.  And the fact that it is made in NYC as opposed to a far away place with questionable labor practices makes me proud to own such a unique, stylish bag. Thank you Saintly for this one-of-a kind bag! Can't wait to get one for myself.  <br/><b>- Susan Payrovi</b><br/><br/>Truly a piece of art – harkens back to the days when travel was both elegant and sophisticated.  Durable enough to replace my long-haul business luggage,  stylish enough to bring to any 5-star resort or beach bungalow.  Looks better with each passing mile…   <br/><b>- Drew Kelley</b><br/><br/>Happy to be one of the early contributors to the success of Saintly Bags! I travel extensively for both business and pleasure, and more often than not, someone make a comment in an airport or hotel about how handsome the bag is.  For me, however, the beauty is far from skin deep, as the bag has demonstrated that it can take a beating despite my best efforts to treat it kindly. We plan on ordering the Weekender size bag in the near future.  -<br/><b>- Brian Faudoa</b>

The compact One Night Stand comfortably gets
you through an overnight or 2-day trip, and compliments a rolling carry-on for much longer ones (note the handle attachment strap on the left of the red bag).  It also makes a great daily bag to carry your laptop, gym clothes, and shoes.

your laptop, chargers, and magazines from shock and water.  It provides
easy access at all times, making airport security an absolute breeze.  *
The Weekend Fling’s Laptop Pocket can hold up to a 15″ laptop and some newer

exceeding 9″ height).
          
Shoe PocketsPlaced on the ends of the bag, these pockets
each hold up to 2 pairs of shoes, depending on size. Conveniently doubling as

they're soft, they collapse when empty for maximum space in the main
compartment. You can select 1 or 2 pockets.Quick Access PocketDrop your cell phone, wallet,
passport and headphones into this pocket for convenient access and a safe,

leather from Italy. It will lighten slightly with time and gain character very

Cotta, Chestnut, Chocolate, and Red.
Longhorn is a beefier and heavier cowhide coming from
Brazil. As the leather is stitched and worked, its hue lightens slightly,
giving it a worn character. It has a heavier grain and lighter protective coat,
so it will wear in quickly. It is available in Black, Mahogany, and British

When the bag arrived, the quality of the craftsmanship far exceeded our expectations because it was obvious that a great deal of time and attention went into constructing the bag.  And the fact that it is made in NYC as opposed to a far away place with questionable labor practices makes me proud to own such a unique, stylish bag. Thank you Saintly for this one-of-a kind bag! Can't wait to get one for myself.  - Susan PayroviTruly a piece of art – harkens back to the days when travel was both elegant and sophisticated.  Durable enough to replace my long-haul business luggage,  stylish enough to bring to any 5-star resort or beach bungalow.  Looks better with each passing mile…   - Drew KelleyHappy to be one of the early contributors to the success of Saintly Bags! I travel extensively for both business and pleasure, and more often than not, someone make a comment in an airport or hotel about how handsome the bag is.  For me, however, the beauty is far from skin deep, as the bag has demonstrated that it can take a beating despite my best efforts to treat it kindly. We plan on ordering the Weekender size bag in the near future.  -- Brian Faudoa

ALL WATCHES ARE GUARANTEED TO BE POSTED TO BACKERS BY AUGUST 28TH.





Lancaster Roberts' first 3 collections are diverse, yet showcase the same core values and principles; simplicity and class.






Our First Editions range, pioneering classic suede straps, are the bench mark for which we base our entire philosophy. Proving that even the most humble of materials can walk hand in hand with some of the most precious.Secondly, our Catena Series. A collection of chain straps in 3 distinct colours- a perfect way to steal the limelight when entering a room.
Lastly, we have our Limited Edition Hirsch Leather Collection. With only 250 pieces of each design able to be made worldwide, this collection really showcases our ambition to become one of the most respected names in the watch industry.      Every Lancaster Roberts watch comes secured in our uniquely designed packaging. Our luxurious presentation case is lined with genuine Onyx Black leather with an interior of sesame cream, this is not just any packaging.However where Lancaster Roberts diversifys from every other watch manufacturer in the world today, is we offer the opportunity to make a timepiece your very own.Including a complimentary engraving service, you are free to engrave any message or text on the back of your chosen watch. This can of course be for yourself, or even as part of a unique present for a special someone.
It all started when our group of friends and watch lovers began to wonder what actually defined a luxury watch? Although there is a huge selection of designs and straps available,  we found that leading luxury watches from the likes of Rolex and Tag Heuer are just too expensive for the modern day professional.To find the solution to our problem, we really needed to understand what actually makes a luxury timepiece. We found that the quality of the watch is the most important, but just as much so, was everything else that comes with it.The best watchmakers in the world spend endless hours refining every element to perfect the overall look and feel of their creation. However, for many craftsmen, the obsession with detail doesn't stop there.





They have put their heart and soul into a beautifully engineered piece of wrist wear. Buying a genuine luxury watch isn't just buying a watch, it's buying into a lifestyle.We decided, if we want to brush shoulders with the best watch-makers in the world, we need to meet them and learn from them. We bought some last minute tickets to Switzerland to attend Baselworld, the biggest watch convention on the planet.We got advice from the likes of Rolex, Tag Heure and Raymond Weil, which resulted in us being introduced to our amazing Swiss manufacturer who we are now working with to make our next range of watches officially Swiss made.In other words, the watch should take your breath away. You should be excited to wear it every time you open the presentation case.Overall, we feel that a luxury timepiece is a concert of 3 distinctive characteristics:Design - A beautifully manufactured design using the highest quality materials with focus on celebrating the finer details of watch making.Everyday - It should be timeless (excuse the pun), but you should be able to wear it casually, whilst also dressing for more formal events in your finest attire.Purpose - Lastly, the watch should be completely unique to the wearer. That personal touch can make all the difference.Your Time is a service which simply shows how much we care about each and every watch we make. Our dedicated team will find the personal time zone which your address belongs to and set your Lancaster Roberts so it is ready to wear the second you lay your eyes on it. Just a little extra special detail, but it's the small details that can make the biggest difference.One section of the watch industry we want to rejuvenate is the problem of straps being too big or too small when you receive your watch. This is a problem we had encounterd ourselves, so that's how we developed our unique Wrist Assessment procedure.We worked with Hirsch Leather to develop a measuring instrument which measures the exact circumference of your wrist and lets us know exactly how big or small we need to make your strap, so it fits perfectly.We also appreciate that waiting for a product can be tough. Our team have been through the exact same process, it can be hard not knowing where your product is and when it will be arriving.This inspired us to develop an app for iPhone & android smart phones, which allows every backer after the IndieGogo campaign, to fully track their watch through out the entire manufacturing process. You will know exactly where your unique watch is at all times whilst waiting for it to arrive.We spent countless hours trying to find a logo or symbol that could really express what Lancaster Roberts actually stood for. Then we got it.Our philosophy is to deliver a beautiful, elegantly designed range of watches, all of which are individual in their own distinctive way.A leaf is a direct product from a tree's growth, but although that tree may produce hundreds of thousands of leaves, every single one is completely unique.
This is where we found a harmony within Lancaster Roberts between the company’s philosophy and passion for delivering exclusive products to every single individual.




We are extremely lucky to have a team of highly skilled, passionate people working with us to help make our dream a reality.



We have also been fortunate to work with some of the worlds best watch manufacturers, using their years of experience to help us refine and develop our first range.
We took inspiration from the most luxurious companies in the world to perfect our designs and the overall presentation of our product. Working tirelessly and obsessing over every little detail, we finally completed our very first collection.
We wanted to keep the overall design simple. As we know, class is not who speaks most or loudest, but who makes the most sense. We decided on a 2 hand classic watch face and designed our mechanism to sit in the comfort of our 6.3mm reinforced casing, this was to achieve elegance whilst also maintaining durability.




Each design is available to men and women and come in both a 40mm or a more dainty 36mm model. This is to make sure our watches fit every wrist flawlessly and with complete comfort.
Every watch comes readily installed with scratch resistant sapphire crystal glass and driven by a 4-Jeweled Swiss Quartz movement.







We wanted to make a truly beautiful timepiece that has everything a luxury watch should have, just without the extortionate price tag. We wanted to cut out the middlemen and go straight to the consumer, to maximize savings which are then passed on to you. 



This is why we are giving every IndieGogo supporter the chance to have their very own Lancaster Roberts timepiece before our watches can be found in jewellery retailers and they mark up their prices.



We have teamed up with an amazing technology company to help log and register everyone's orders and details, simply to organize our backers accordingly. 
Doing this will not only help us deliver the watches faster then our deadline, but also deal with your watch order in an organised manner which allows us to make every element extra perfect.




         
We wanted to make sure we had an established manufacturing group with years of experience in making high quality watches to work with us to build our first collection. Lancaster Roberts stand by a company ethos of developing long term and fruitful relationships with our partners. 
Visiting their facility to meet the amazing team, so we could go into every detail and make sure the finished product was exactly what we wanted. 




Each partner understands our specifications to the last tiny detail. This is the level of accuracy a luxury watch company must work to. The likes of Rolex, Tag Heuer and Breitling all showcase this skill. And although our product is at a more accessible price point, we would like to think we work with that same elite precision that truly defines world class watch making.Every Lancaster Roberts comes supplied with an international warranty card to ensure you piece of mind.We have the ultimate trust in the engineering of our watches. If anything were to happen to your watch within 5 years, we will personally repair or replace the timepiece completely free of charge.    •Face Diameter: 40mm/36mm•Thickness: 6.3mm•Case Material: Reinforced Stainless Steel•Clasp: Classic Buckle Clasp •Sapphire Crystal Glass•Display: Analog •Movement: Swiss Made Gold Ronda 4 Jeweled Quartz Movement•Power: Swiss Made 1.55V Renata Battery •Water Resistant: 3 ATM International 5 year Warranty Our brief has been submitted to our manufacturer and we have surveys ready to send to all our backers and gather relevant information in regards to design, size and engraving details. Once the IndieGogo is successfully funded, we will begin the manufacturing process to make sure every backer gets their Lancaster Roberts watch on time.

This is where IndieGogo comes in. We need your support to help launch our first range of luxury timepieces. Our manufacturer has our designs and samples have been approved. They are simply waiting for the green light. Your support can help us do that and really get our journey on the road. Not to mention you will be one of the first people on the planet to own a Lancaster Roberts timepiece.

Our team consists of a distinct  team of creatively fueled product designers with a extraordinary passion for timepieces and packaging. Embracing over 15 years of collective experience in designing products, logistics and marketing.








We are currently working on designing a new Aeon series comprising of an Automatic movement and hopefully our first 10k gold watch.

</div></div>","Founder, Company and Brand


I'm an Italian entrepreneur, ski instructor and CEO of H-Com LIMITED, owner of the brand ""Hill"". I've developed my skills, working for important Italian sportswear and sports equipment companies, both related to all mountain activities.


One year ago I created the brand ""Hill outdoor”, where the logo represents the double ""ll"" of the word “Hill” within a rectangle, recalling the pause symbol.



The Hill collection is designed for mountain, leisure, cycling and running. Our goal is to offer sportswear and leisure apparel at an advantageous price, by choosing high quality fabrics, high quality accessories and ""made in Italy"" production.



Our business, is mainly based on the e-commerce and e-booking sales on: www.hilloutdoor.com
E-booking, is a new concept to promote Hill outdoor products selling directly to the customers with no additional cost, like:


traditional sales network


retails


middlemen




Why you should contribute to this project?


Because the product is best of quality (fabrics, accessories and handicraft)


Because the product is 100% real Made in Italy (Veneto Region)


Because you can book and buy the product any time, any where independently of the season


Because you will be the first ambassadors of the brand and testimonial of the product




Donations will be used to cover the costs of:


Web development (20%)


Design (16%)


Products development (48%)


Online marketing strategies (16%)




What We Need & What You Get

 
We need your support and sharing ""Hill outdoor"" apparel with your friends.Our goal is to offer ""hill Outdoor"" apparel at an advantageous price, selling directly to the customers that often buy online and those who do not trust in buying online because they want to see how does it fit. How to engage the last?


Developing an innovative web site, a smart app and an algorithm called ""personal shopper online"" (that after taking some body measurements to the consumer, compare the volumes of consumer with those of clothing chosen and it choose the most proper size).


By presenting periodically apparel collections and offering to the consumers to see the projects in progress and have their feedback


Publishing photos, videos and descriptions that explain the product, its features


Using social media network and their ADS campaigns

You will be the protagonists of the product that we will offer.The Impact
Buying the product using the e-booking formula brings multiple advantages to the final customers, as for the example the possibility to: 


always finding the right size and color available 


always finding new collection and their restyle


always finding the product in the 4 seasons versions 


always having an advantageous price because you directly buy from the company without any logistic chain costs in the middle


always being the product's principal


For the company the advantages are:
optimizing the production and produce without generating stock 


not adopting the banking system and its monetary constrictions


reducing production costs 


using one single sale channel, online


selling over produced products on the e-commerce 


using most important web market-places to position the product and save marketing costs 


avoiding non-regulamentation of the price generated by online players that creates final customer confusion in his choice


Risks & Challenges
  
The risks and challenges that this business model could have are the following:the buying system and the product booking, customers would like to try before buying the timeframe between the order and the delivery of the product, customers would like to use the product straight awayTo satisfy the customers and overcome these risks, the solution to these problems are the following: 

the production of tutorial videos showing the products, its wearability and the way to choose the size thanks an ""online personal shopper"" system


we will care about the client by sending him personalised sms and email during the waiting timeframe, with the reminder of the production phase its product is in, in order to care about him more and make him feeling the waiting time shorter

<p>We all know that babies cry. But sometimes they really cry.
And cry. And cry. And nothing seems to soothe them. They’ve been fed, burped,
changed and cuddled, but still they go on crying.  </p>
<p>Working in a hospital nursery, I saw first-hand the
challenges many parents and professionals face when trying to calm a crying
baby. And I could feel their frustration, anxiety and stress rising, which
would only exacerbate the situation. </p>
<p>I hunted high and low, but struggled to find the perfect

<p><b><i>Swaddling</i></b> can

<p style=""text-align: left; color: #49352f;"">After considering the difficulties I’d seen so many parents experience, and the features and benefits that were lacking in existing soothing methods, I developed the Tranquilo Mat.

<div></div>
“I have to tell you the mat really, really works
(as if you don't already know that)!!! I wasn't sure how she'd react, since
she never responds to the vibration mode in her bassinet, but she stops crying
almost immediately with this! It's amazing! What a God send for fussy babies!”
– Kristen N. <div><br/></div>
<div>“It worked well and we used it almost every day
to help keep her calm, mostly in conjunction with the activity mat. She really
seemed to like the “slow wave” mode. It was nice to have a few different modes
to try out depending on her moods.” – Derrick S.<br/>
</div>
<div>
“It’s a great idea. I can definitely see a use
for this in our nursery! Especially for the really fussy babies.” - Scott L., Pediatrician <br/>
</div>
<div>
“My 4-year-old son loved to use it to calm his
sister. Every time she would cry, he would run to get the mat and then turn it
on before handing it to me to place it near her.” – Jude S.<br/>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>“It’s a great idea. It’s the ‘neurologic white-noise’ I
always tell parents their babies love and need because it reminds them of the
womb.” – Laura N., Pediatrician</p>
<p>“I would love to have a few of these to use in our
nursery!” – Deb D., maternity RN</p>
<p>“I was amazed because it calmed him in his car seat and he
HATES his car seat. He normally cried the entire time he has to spend in there,
which is especially tedious on a long car ride. For that reason and that reason
alone, I’d pay you $100 for one right now!” –Lindsey B.</p>
<p>“It helped my daughter enjoy ‘tummy time’ for a bit longer

<p>After more than two years of hard work, our team is
committed to executing Tranquilo’s innovative idea to the world as smoothly as
possible to ensure a timely full-scale production. However, despite our best
efforts, we cannot fully predict the future. So we’ve identified a few
potential risks that we want you, our loyal supporters, to be aware of:</p>
<p><b><i>Manufacturing</i></b>:
Creating an innovative product for babies can be expensive, challenging and
time-consuming due to the numerous – and totally necessary – safety standards
required. As such, we’re working with a team of professionals – manufacturers,
engineers, doctors and lawyers – with many years of experience in Juvenile
Product Manufacturing, to ensure we meet and exceed all these rigorous safeguards.
</p>
<p>Additionally, in order to produce on a large scale, we
will need to meet increases in tooling and production equipment. So, although
we’ve already worked closely with our manufacturer to ensure a high quality Tranquilo product is produced, the additional volume could cause some delays.</p>
<p><b><i>Product Adjustments</i></b>: In
order to deliver an optimal product, we may need to undergo some minor
adjustments to the final design. Any and all improvements will be made with
safety and user benefit in mind. We will also be sure to communicate with our
customers exactly how and why any changes are made.</p>
<p><b><i>Fulfillment</i></b>: Despite
our best efforts, due to the complexities of manufacturing a new product, there
may be factors we cannot control such as equipment malfunction, transport or
supplier delays. We hope that your support will enable us to begin production
on a commercial scale without delay, and in anticipation of this campaign we have
already established a well-oiled supply chain to help us smoothly roll out
Tranquilo. However, if there is an overwhelming demand, we may need to scale up
the factory or set up manufacturing operations in additional locations. </p>
<p>We will do our utmost to produce Tranquilo as quickly as
possible, whilst ensuring the highest quality and safety standards of every
product. And we will prioritize early backers to ensure they’re first in line to
receive their Tranquilo Mat. </p>
<p>Lastly, to ensure we’re fully prepared, we’re also in the
process of establishing additional, secondary supplier relationships to meet
any complex production-related issues that may arise.</p>

The lightweight, flexible, versatile and completely portable vibrating mat for babies
Why settle for old-fashioned and inconvenient soothing methods? Tranquilo Mat is completely PORTABLE and provides all the VERSATILITY you could possibly need. Designed by a Registered Nurse, Tranquilo Mat is soft, compact and lightweight – the perfect companion for today’s busy, on-the-go parents.

Happy baby = Happy parents




















What’s it all about?


We all know that babies cry. But sometimes they really cry.
And cry. And cry. And nothing seems to soothe them. They’ve been fed, burped,
changed and cuddled, but still they go on crying.  
Working in a hospital nursery, I saw first-hand the

would only exacerbate the situation. 
I hunted high and low, but struggled to find the perfect
soothing method or product: 
Swaddling can
be a difficult skill to master, and can even be dangerous if not done
correctly.  
Swaying, rocking, bouncing, walks or
long car rides require a lot of time and energy, which most
sleep-deprived parents don’t have in abundance! 

Infant swings, vibrating chairs and
vibrating mattress pads are bulky, difficult to transport
and don’t encourage bonding, as they require putting your baby down. 


So I decided to create my own!


After considering the difficulties I’d seen so many parents experience, and the features and benefits that were lacking in existing soothing methods, I developed the Tranquilo Mat. It’s a simple to use, battery operated vibrating mat that’s lightweight and flexible for optimal portability and versatility. It comes in 2 sizes and its unique design makes it effective either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with any of the methods
listed above.


Calm happy baby = calm, happy parents

And what’s more, moms and dads can benefit even further, as Tranquilo Mat can also be used for adults. It’s great for soothing and relaxing tired muscles, like those aching necks and backs so often experienced by parents. So Tranquilo keeps on working even after your baby outgrows it.

Lastly, to ensure we’re fully prepared, we’re also in the
process of establishing additional, secondary supplier relationships to meet
any complex production-related issues that may arise.





What we believe in



Tranquilo believes it is every business’s responsibility to serve their community and give back to those in need.   
As part of our community outreach, we will donate Tranquilo Mats to local shelters in the Boston area serving homeless women and children. Whilst we already have a few organizations in mind to receive our donations, please feel free to reach out to us if you know of any other deserving charities.

Additionally, 3% of all proceeds – both from this campaign and future Tranquilo sales – will be donated to Operation Shanti. A charity based in Mysore, India, Operation Shanti works hard to meet the basic needs – food, shelter, education, medical assistance, and lots of comfort and stability – of the poorest and neediest school-aged children escaping life on the streets. “Every child deserves the opportunity to reach their fullest potential.”

<p>If we raise <b>$50,000!</b> - There's a lot of cool features we have in mind but we can't squeeze them all in our first version. With your help &amp; support we want to include the following awesome features to our app:</p>
<p>- A ""borrow to buy"" option for those times you think ""Hmm this dress is way too cute.. can I just go ahead and keep it?!"" </p>
<p>- Create groups with your close friends and join organizations in your area. Use this feature for shoutouts - need something specific like a sequin red dress? let your fellow moochers know. </p>

<p><b>So you've got some more questions..</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What kind of things can I list to lend? </b></p>
<p>You can list any wardrobe items including dresses, skirts, heels, accessories, jewelry, tops, scarves, belts, jackets/sweaters, athletic wear, etc. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How can I make sure my stuff is returned in good condition?</b></p>
<p>We want you to only lend items you feel comfortable lending, and only to people you trust. Although Mooch cannot reimburse you for lost, stolen or damaged items, we do offer you a way to rate your borrowing and lending experience with your fellow moochers. We highly encouraged borrowing &amp; lending amongst trusted friends, especially those who have good ratings! </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>When will I get my stuff back?</b></p>
<p>As the lender, you can modify the return date. If the borrower needs to pickup/return your item(s) sooner or later they can communicate with you via the in-app chat but ultimately you make the decision to edit pickup/drop off dates. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>When do I rate the person I lent my item to?</b></p>
<p>Once the drop-off time has passed, you as a lender have the option to rate your experience with the borrower. If you want to give the borrower more time to return the item before you rate them, you can just change the return date.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;"">
<b>What if I need to change the pick-up/drop-off up dates, but I'm a borrower?</b><p></p>
<p>You can communicate with the lender via the in-app chat, if the lender is okay with modifying the pick-up/drop-off dates they can change these at their discretion.</p>
</div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Do I have to pay to borrow something?</b></p>
<p>Nope, mooch is a completely free borrowing and lending platform. You should never ask or be asked to provide money on the side in order to borrow or lend using mooch.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Is mooch for women’s clothing items only?</b></p>
<p>Yes, Mooch is currently only for the women’s clothing &amp; fashion space. Mooch Group, Inc. is working on plans to launch similar apps for men’s clothing &amp; other items such as electronics, books, games, etc. in the future. </p>

</div><div>The Mooch Team </div></div>","Why do I have nothing to wear?

This is a question you've asked yourself before a lot right? Why does it seem like although your closet is stuffed full of a bajillion things you've bought for the past 5 years you still can't manage to put together a decent outfit for your friend's wedding or simply a night out? 



This is where Mooch steps in. 

We're creating a solution that will allow you to extend your wardrobe and enable you to enjoy new and popular fashion trends without the expensive price tag (in fact, for totally free!).

Using Mooch Is Easy!
1. List what you don’t really wear and lend it to your friends. 
2. Browse & borrow outfits and other wardrobe items from your friends.
3. Wear the perfect outfit or complete an incomplete outfit (ex: when you need the right shoes or handbag to go with the dress!).

Our exciting plans



The Mooch team is passionate about reaching our goals, but we can't do it without you. With your help, Mooch will be able to reach the following major milestones: 
Once we raise $25,000 - Launch the Mooch app as soon as possible & bring it to your area.
If we raise $50,000! - There's a lot of cool features we have in mind but we can't squeeze them all in our first version. With your help & support we want to include the following awesome features to our app:
- A ""borrow to buy"" option for those times you think ""Hmm this dress is way too cute.. can I just go ahead and keep it?!"" 
- Create groups with your close friends and join organizations in your area. Use this feature for shoutouts - need something specific like a sequin red dress? let your fellow moochers know. 
- Looking for new outfit ideas or simply want to keep up with trending celeb fashion? The Mooch featured and trending fashionistas section will let allow you to keep up with that new romper Taylor Swift's been rockin' on magazine covers.
- Organize events with local fashionistas to enjoy a glass of wine & swap outfits while making new friends. 
- Ability to share your shameless Mooching activities on different social media platforms, show off those sparkly heels you found on Mooch, that you didn't even pay for ;)


If we raise $100,000! - It doesn't stop at nationwide app launch & a bunch of exciting new additional features. 
If we cross this stretch goal we want to expand our app internationally and make mooching even more convenient for you! A larger budget like this will allow us to build partnerships with delivery companies and partner with new clothing brands so you can be the first to mooch trending fashion, the opportunities are endless. 



So you've got some more questions..
What kind of things can I list to lend? 
You can list any wardrobe items including dresses, skirts, heels, accessories, jewelry, tops, scarves, belts, jackets/sweaters, athletic wear, etc. 
How can I make sure my stuff is returned in good condition?
We want you to only lend items you feel comfortable lending, and only to people you trust. Although Mooch cannot reimburse you for lost, stolen or damaged items, we do offer you a way to rate your borrowing and lending experience with your fellow moochers. We highly encouraged borrowing & lending amongst trusted friends, especially those who have good ratings! 
When will I get my stuff back?
As the lender, you can modify the return date. If the borrower needs to pickup/return your item(s) sooner or later they can communicate with you via the in-app chat but ultimately you make the decision to edit pickup/drop off dates. 
When do I rate the person I lent my item to?
Once the drop-off time has passed, you as a lender have the option to rate your experience with the borrower. If you want to give the borrower more time to return the item before you rate them, you can just change the return date.


What if I need to change the pick-up/drop-off up dates, but I'm a borrower?
You can communicate with the lender via the in-app chat, if the lender is okay with modifying the pick-up/drop-off dates they can change these at their discretion.

Do I have to pay to borrow something?
Nope, mooch is a completely free borrowing and lending platform. You should never ask or be asked to provide money on the side in order to borrow or lend using mooch.
Is mooch for women’s clothing items only?
Yes, Mooch is currently only for the women’s clothing & fashion space. Mooch Group, Inc. is working on plans to launch similar apps for men’s clothing & other items such as electronics, books, games, etc. in the future. 
If you love our app, we'd love your help.

We've been building a fantastic app that pre-beta users already love, but we need your help in finishing development & rolling out the app nationwide as soon as possible.
We need $25,000 which will be used exactly as listed below: 

$20,000: Finishing app development, beta testing, app improvement & fixes.
$2,500: Marketing & Promotional costs to bring Mooch to you. 
$2,500: Building an initial inventory of wardrobe items.



Mooch Group, Inc. promises that every dollar you contribute will be used for the purpose of finishing app development, improving the app, bringing the app to your area & building a base mooch inventory.
If you are unable to help financially, please see below for other ways you can help make Mooch a success!

<br/>Dauntless-Clothing, LLC was founded in 2015 in New York City by Paula Maldonado, a Colombian designer and entrepreneur. Her experience in the global luxury market and creative agencies made her realize the need to bring socially conscious and affordable fashion to the masses.  A mixture of her affinity for the perfect fit, her passion for sustainability and the need for conscious pricing led to the conception of Dauntless. Our initial collection was designed with a global customer in mind – a citizen of the world who craves quality of materials, a well-tailored fit, and a fashion forward silhouette at an accessible price.  <br/>

The area boasts a fabulous landscape tinged with Middle Age Oriental hue and drystone walls and between these magical lands a millenary treasure is to be found: <strong>olive trees. </strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568723983/tazvams4swsq2spwxptf.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Deeply proud of its heritage, Muchimoo creates in this very region <strong>unique classic loafers</strong>.

By 2013, olive trees started to show unusual symptoms of decline. It was discovered that several olive trees were affected by <i><strong>Xylella Fastidiosa</strong></i>, a terrible bacteria that would not leave until the death of the tree. Today, the bacteria is spreading at an increasing rate. Farmers whose families have tended olives for generations watched their trees dry up and their businesses plummet.</p><p>We, from Muchimoo, needed to do something. We had our new loafer model ready to go to market, so we partnered with Save the Olives, a local NGO focused on protecting century old olive trees. We designed  <strong>four limited olive tree themed loafers, </strong>which we are offering at an amazing price here on Indiegogo.

The area boasts a fabulous landscape tinged with Middle Age Oriental hue and drystone walls and between these magical lands a millenary treasure is to be found: olive trees. Deeply proud of its heritage, Muchimoo creates in this very region unique classic loafers. The company has spent one whole year working on a new design and is now looking forward to launch it.  But what is the link between olives trees and a young fashion startup?Today, olive orchards in Salento are in danger, the whole Salento is in danger. By 2013, olive trees started to show unusual symptoms of decline. It was discovered that several olive trees were affected by Xylella Fastidiosa, a terrible bacteria that would not leave until the death of the tree. Today, the bacteria is spreading at an increasing rate. Farmers whose families have tended olives for generations watched their trees dry up and their businesses plummet.We, from Muchimoo, needed to do something. We had our new loafer model ready to go to market, so we partnered with Save the Olives, a local NGO focused on protecting century old olive trees. We designed  four limited olive tree themed loafers, which we are offering at an amazing price here on Indiegogo. Part of the revenue from the sales will fully fund a program aimed to re-plant bacteria resistant Olive trees in the most affected areas of Salento. Our goal was to create a loafer that was extremely comfortable, 100% made in Italy, with first class quality, and with high price value. It seemed impossible...but we made it! We took inspiration from the classic and timeless designs but we added innovation and a touch of brilliance!Below you can find Muchimoo's four different models, each comes in red, black, dark green or dark blue and each model has a male and a female version.                                       THE LOAFERS ARE NOT MANUFACTURED UNTIL THE ORDER IS CONFIRMED  PRODUCTION CAN TAKE UP TO 3 WEEKS   We can proudly say that within these loafers, traditional values and technology go hand in hand. Every piece is cut, binded, glued, skived and lasted by expert hands hand with the support of the latest technologies.                                      Our suppliers are all in Salento and we managed to centralize all our processes from production to final shipment, drastically reducing our environmental impact and our final costs.  Xylella fastidiosa is a pathogen bacterium transmitted by the insects that feed on the plants’ lymph. It was believed to be isolated into South America until when it was discovered in Salento in 2013. It might have traveled from South America to Europe by importing ornamental plants hosting the bacterium. Olive trees are so important that are considered as the ""cultural heritage"" of Salento.  Olive trees are not merely a decorative natural item to the landscape. The Salento area without olive trees is inconceivable and the economy would suffer terribly. To date the olive oil production has fallen by 65% and if no action is taken the situation will worsen. Science has not found a solution yet. It has been proposed to create buffer zones by deforesting areas wide as 20 km, form one side to the other of the Apulia region. But such containment measures encountered serious challenges, from public reluctance to lack of effective actions by governmental authorities.Now, due to Xylella fastidiosa, the scenery has terribly changed. Entire fields of centuries-old olive trees have been severely injured and killed. Thousands have remained untreated and have rapidly dried up. Green has changed into brown and life has turned to death.Following the outbreak of Xylella Fastidiosa in 2013 in Salento, the bacterium has the ability to spread throughout the Mediterranean basin starting from our peninsula. After having infected the Apulia region, it can spread in all Italian regions where quality olive cultivation is practiced (Tuscany, Sicily, etc.). Crossing the Italian borders the bacterium is already present in France, Spain, and Iran with imminent risk of arriving in all the Mediterranean countries. If no effective containment measures are taken, the outcomes could be catastrophic for the biodiversity, economy and landscape of the whole Mediterranean region.Until the olive trees fell ill, Xylella had never been seen in Europe, and its identification in Salento set off alarm bells across the scientific and political communities. Farmers desperately tried to save their olive groves, but without success.We from Muchimoo, do not have a science lab yet, therefore our way to fight back the bacteria, is by supporting the local communities in planting bacteria resistant olive trees (Leccino and Favolosa species). We have partnered with Save the Olives, a local NGO detached by politics and believing in a sustainable future for agriculture in their beloved Salento. With the funds generated by this campaign, Save the Olives will plant-bacteria resistant olive trees in target fields of South Salento, the area most affected by Xylella Fastidiosa.",40.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>We are still new to Indiegogo, but our manufacturing team has over 10 years of experience in the watch industry. We are aware our project is complex and that there are always unforeseen issues, but we have anticipated and planned for potential risks and have built a production and delivery plan. Firstly, Our production is quite advanced, and you can be confident about our capacity to provide high-quality products on time. We spent over 8 months designing, developing, and receiving finalized samples while working with the master. Secondly, we have skillful and professional manufacturers who do not anticipate delays in our timeline. It supposes to set up two periods for our customers. However, if by chance, anything unexpected happens, we promise to keep you informed, both during the campaign and afterward. Thanks for all the support! We are excited to take this next step with you, the Indiegogo community!</p>

Risks and challenges
We are still new to Indiegogo, but our manufacturing team has over 10 years of experience in the watch industry. We are aware our project is complex and that there are always unforeseen issues, but we have anticipated and planned for potential risks and have built a production and delivery plan. Firstly, Our production is quite advanced, and you can be confident about our capacity to provide high-quality products on time. We spent over 8 months designing, developing, and receiving finalized samples while working with the master. Secondly, we have skillful and professional manufacturers who do not anticipate delays in our timeline. It supposes to set up two periods for our customers. However, if by chance, anything unexpected happens, we promise to keep you informed, both during the campaign and afterward. Thanks for all the support! We are excited to take this next step with you, the Indiegogo community!",29.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Derrick Bass and I am the founder of The Opulent Brand. The Opulent Brand is an urban streetwear brand that provides opportunities to youth from underserved communities through the sales of its fashion. We use our clothes to breakdown educational and social barriers, as a portion of all of our proceeds go to charities who serve under resourced communities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need about $1,500 to complete this project. This amount will allow us to purchase a top of the line heat press for our products. Below find you can find the perks of supporting our campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>$10 supporters will receive a personalized email from me expressing my gratitude for your support</li>
<li>$25 supporters will receive a ""Thank You"" card and a ""The Opulent Brand"" button</li>
<li>$50 supporters will receive a ""The Opulent Brand"" Dad hat</li>
<li>$75 supporters will receive a ""The Opulent Brand"" tee-shirt</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, the funds that we do receive will towards finishing our website, as that is the priority for us at this moment. Since we are an e-commerce, we want to ensure the online shopping experience is like no other.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since 2015, our philanthropic efforts include donations to a local charter school to help students with uniform purchases, we have provided clean water and diapers to victims of Hurricane Harvey in Houston, TX and helping Chicago Public School students with their prom cost. As we continue this journey, we want to do more and your contribution will help us!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any business, we face many risk, but our top risk right now for this stage of our business are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring we make a profit in order to fulfill our social-entrepreneurial mission.</li>
<li>Expanding our current customer base in order to increase our market reach.</li>
<li>Keeping enough product on hand, to ensure we meet the demand of our customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan negate these risk by the current market opportunity:</p>
<ul>
<li>T-shirts alone have grossed $3 billion in annual sales  </li>
<li>Demand for online original design T-shirts has been rising as consumers increasingly shop with e-tailers for convenience</li>
<li>The popularity of internet retailers has skyrocketed to about $367 million  </li>
<li>High-end streetwear helped boost global sales of luxury personal goods by 5 percent this year to an estimated €263 billion ($309 billion), according to a new study released Wednesday by consultancy Bain &amp; Company</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2018, more than 1,875 fashion retailers shut down. This year, projections reported by WWD place the number at just under 10,000, “up 53 percent from the number of doors that went dark amidst the Great Recession in 2008.”</p>
<p>Digital innovation, rising globalization, and changes in consumer spending habits have catapulted the fashion industry into the midst of seismic shifts.</p>
<p>Driving this growth are four notable opportunities:</p>
<p>Expanding global markets outside the West</p>
<p>Increasing online access and smartphone penetration</p>
<p>Emerging worldwide middle-classes with disposable income</p>
<p>Innovating technologies to create experiential ecommerce</p>
<p>Fashion consumers will also have more buying power, as the number of potential customers is projected to grow to more than 1.2 billion by 2020. The good news for fashion is that the majority of these new consumers are within the 16 to 24 and 25 to 34 age groups.</p>

We plan negate these risk by the current market opportunity:

T-shirts alone have grossed $3 billion in annual sales  
Demand for online original design T-shirts has been rising as consumers increasingly shop with e-tailers for convenience
The popularity of internet retailers has skyrocketed to about $367 million  
High-end streetwear helped boost global sales of luxury personal goods by 5 percent this year to an estimated €263 billion ($309 billion), according to a new study released Wednesday by consultancy Bain & Company

In 2018, more than 1,875 fashion retailers shut down. This year, projections reported by WWD place the number at just under 10,000, “up 53 percent from the number of doors that went dark amidst the Great Recession in 2008.”
Digital innovation, rising globalization, and changes in consumer spending habits have catapulted the fashion industry into the midst of seismic shifts.
Driving this growth are four notable opportunities:
Expanding global markets outside the West
Increasing online access and smartphone penetration
Emerging worldwide middle-classes with disposable income
Innovating technologies to create experiential ecommerce
Fashion consumers will also have more buying power, as the number of potential customers is projected to grow to more than 1.2 billion by 2020. The good news for fashion is that the majority of these new consumers are within the 16 to 24 and 25 to 34 age groups.

There is a clear focus to highlight various mechanical and design features found on various aircraft from around the world. These special details make the watch look like it's always moving at Mach speed. The hands of a watch are just as important as the gauges on a fighter jet. They require accuracy and precision in order to convey information concisely. This is why the hands on the Commander Series have contrasting, colored tips for clarity. The custom-cut hands also make it seem like the wearer is staring directly at the instrumentation of their own aircraft. The aircraft industry is all about innovation and this feature is something wonderfully unique. The traditional second hand of the Commander Series has been scrapped in favor of a second wheel. This wheel moves like the turbine of a plane and propels time forward. Not only is it very functional, but it is seriously cool to look at. Just like flying, time should never be boring. This feature was designed for the jetsetters and frequent flyers. When traveling between time zones, it is easy to lose track of time, particularly whether it is AM or PM. That’s where the Commander Series’ 24-hour indicator comes in. By showing the hour of the day, time never eludes the wearer. Curves are beautiful and aerodynamic. The front glass of our newest watch aims to make the wearer feel like a pilot. The smooth curve of the glass as it blends seamlessly with the body of the watch mimics the cockpit canopy found on aircraft. Who says pilots always have the best views?   Mechanics in motion is magical. The Commander Series features layer upon layer of intricate, mechanical parts all moving in perfect harmony. Just like with the exposed engines of vintage aircrafts, the wearer will be able to see each carefully-considered piece of the Miyota 82S7 that brings life to this timepiece .  A watch must make a statement at all times. Taking into consideration comments from our AIRSPEED project backers, we have ensured that this watch glows in the dark. The night helps the Commander shine with the Super Luminous added to the hands and hour markers of our watch. Telling time in the dark is now a breeze. The design of a watch does not stop at its face. Our carefully crafted straps ensure that the overall color scheme of the watch has a complete look. However, we know that taste is not uniform, so we have made our straps easily detachable for extra customizability. At a lug width of 22mm, just about any watch strap can be used in conjunction with the Commander Series.  Our previous timepiece, AIRSPEED, did not allow the wearer to service the watch easily. Taking this feedback into consideration, we have now introduced a screw-back design that allows wearers to access the watch’s internal adjustments as required.",32.0,0,"2 Campaigns

The result is an extremely lightweight, yet durable frame meant to last you a lifetime.  VERSATILITYTOOL FREE ASSEMBLY & EASY MOUNTINGUsing revolutionary joint technology, each handcrafted eye frame can be customized to match anyone's unique style using removable clip accents. Mix and match accents and frames for a range of looks for any occasion, without any tools! It takes less than 5 seconds to create your own look.    ONE FRAME IS ALL YOU NEEDIs it possible for one pair of glasses to replace your entire collection? At ViageA, we believe it is. We make highly customizable modular eyewear, designed for the minimalist, traveler, or everyday wearer looking for the most versatile eye frame. THE ART OF CUSTOMISATIONThe concept is about giving you the freedom to create your perfect pair of personalised glasses.   Using revolutionary joint technology, each handcrafted eye frame can be customized to match anyone's unique style using removable clip accents for your next pair of VIAGEA glasses.By customizing frames with easy-to-install accent clips, we have made it so you can get more, with less.  


  NO MORE NOSE MARK DURABILITY 





 NO LOOSE SCREWS, NO MAINTENANCE

Traditional eye frames are made with individual parts joined together with screws, that need maintenance and loosen over time. We patented our Screwless Hinge system to do away with all the non-essentials: no screws, no rivets, and no soldering.   INTERCHANGEABLE TEMPLE Designed for work, study, or play, the straight temple arms are the timeless style choice for everyday use to match any outfit or look.  Made with curved temple arms and lightweight construction so your frame comfortably stays on your face during any physical activity.  Add the Active Temple Arms for €50.    TAILORED FLEXIBILITY & STYLE

 A Variety of Styles on a Single Frame. Edgy Accents Clips Switch Up Your Look in Seconds. Select your desired base frame shape AND accent clips through the survey after the campaign.   BLUE LIGHT BLOCKING LENSES: Work in front of a screen all day? Smartphones, TV’s, computer screens, & LED’s emit blue light that can cause eye strain, result in headaches, and negatively affect sleep. Our premium Blue Light Blocking Lenses are made for people who spend a lot of their time indoors and are exposed to blue-violet light. UV SUN LENSES:  Our sun lense guarantee protection against UV radiation and glare, resulting in comfortable vision with clear contrast and each pair of glasses is hand made locally by expert hands. We have 3 color options: BLACK, BROWN, GREEN for SUN LENSES and you can choose this after the campaign.  Can I add my prescription lenses? Unfortunately, we do not currently offer prescription lenses for our frames, but your optometrist will be able to easily add prescription lenses and extra adjustments for comfort.

</div><h4>The 3 reasons why you need The ONE dress right now</h4><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><ol>
<li>
<b>This dress will flatter YOUR figure. </b>This was the challenge we gave ourselves: designing a dress that would look good on every woman. More than 50 real woman of all ages and sizes have already tried it on..and loved it! It is SO versatile that in one way or another it will for sure flatter YOU.</li>
<li>
<b>VERSATILE  </b><b>for any occasion. </b>We asked our friends to think about three occasions where they could use The ONE dress and they came up with the styles below, but with your own creativity, other pieces of your wardrobe and some accessories the options are endless!</li>
<li>
<b>It is made out of BAMBOO. </b>If you have never experienced bamboo before, think about the softest, most comfortable and luxurious cotton you can imagine: That´s bamboo. It is also UV protective, hypo-allergenic and possesses anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties AND one of the most EARTH-FRIENDLY fabrics available. If you want to know more about bamboo fabric, please check <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_textiles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_textiles</a>
</li>
</ol></div><p> </p><p>More importantly, The ONE dress is revolutionary because it represents a <b>new life opportunity for mothers of very sick and disabled kids</b>.</p><p> Have you ever sat by a sick friend or a relative who is stuck in bed? Isn't it tedious? Now, imagine you have to stay there by your baby´s bed for weeks, even months waiting for a surgery or while her treatment is ongoing. Imagine that to make matters worse, you can not work so you can not support your family so your financial situation becomes critical. Then, staying by a hospital bed is not tedious anymore, it is desperate.  </p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><b>There are thousands of woman in this situation in China and our mission is to keep these women employed so they can stay at their child's side. </b></b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, there is not so much you can do by a hospital bed. We needed something small, easy to learn, valuable and hand-made. So we came up with The Good Knot: Accesories made out of knots and clothes that include knots as details and buttons. There are 7 of these life changing knots featured on The ONE dress and just ONE dress is enough to keep someone employed and paid for a day.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1045953/files/20141125082346-6_NIN_DW93SJ_AKOGZM9HV7.jpg?1416932626"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div> </div> <div> <h2>
<br/>
</h2>
<h2>What you get </h2>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">We wanted to create a dress that would help the ever running urban woman to go from the office to dinner afterwards. And the mom that doesn´t have much space for her own stuff in her suitcase anymore and needs a one-for-all dress. And specially create a dress  for the woman who cares: the one that doesn't want excess of fabrics polluting her land or exploited people producing her clothes. </div>

<p><b>1. El vestido te quedará perfecto a TI.</b> Ese fue el reto que nos propusimos: diseñar un vestido que le quedara bien a todas las mujeres. Más de cincuenta mujeres reales todas de diferentes edades y tallas se lo han probado ya y les ha encantado. Es tan versátil que no importa cómo sea tu cuerpo, de un modo u otro te favorecerá.</p>
<p><b>2. VERSATIL:</b> Para cualquier ocasión. Le pedimos a nuestras amigas que pensaran tres ocasiones en las que les gustaría usar el vestido y ellas decidieron los estilos de las fotos, pero con tu propia creatividad, otras piezas y accesorios ¡las opciones son infinitas!</p>
<p><b>3. Está hecho de BAMBOO.</b> Si nunca has usado bamboo, piensa en el algodón más suave, cómodo y lujoso que puedas imaginar: Eso es bamboo. También protege contra los rayos ultravioleta, es hipoalergénico y posee propiedades antibacterianas y antihongos. Y además es uno de los téjidos más RESPETUOSOS con el medio que existen.

<p>Aun más importante, The ONE dress is un vestido revolucionario porque representa una <b>oportunidad vital para madres de niños enfermos y discapacitados</b>.</p>
<p> ¿Alguna vez has tenido que hacer compañía a un amigo o familiar hospitalizado? Es tedioso ¿no es cierto? Ahora imagina tener que pasar semanas o incluso meses al lado de tu hijo hospitalizado esperando para que le operen o mientras recibe tratamiento. Imagina que además no puedes trabajar y no tienes ningún ingreso con el que mantener a tu familia. Entonces, ya no es tedioso, es desesperante. </p>
<p><b>Miles de mujeres en China viven en esta situación y nuestra misión es darles un trabajo que puedan hacer mientras cuidan de sus bebés.</b></p>
<p>El problema es que no son tantas las cosas que uno puede hacer junto a la cama de un hospital. Necesitábamos algo pequeño, fácil de aprender, valioso y hecho a mano. Así nace ""The Good Knot"": Accesorios hechos con nudos y prendas que incluyen botones con distintos tipos de nudos. <em>The ONE</em> tiene 7 nudos, suficiente para mantener una madre empleada un día.</p>

<h2>El Impacto</h2>
<div>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Somos un grupo de mujeres viviendo en China donde <strong>aun hoy miles de bebés son abandonados cada año</strong>. En estos años viviendo aquí hemos estado en contacto con diversas organizaciones que se encargan de huérfanos enfermos y consiguen los fondos que necesitan para ser operados o tratados. Fueron estas personas quienes nos explicaron que muchas mujeres abandonan a sus bebés precisamente porque no pueden pagar el tratamiento que necesitan para salvarles la vida y creen que así una familia con más medios le adopte o el orfanato pueda pagar los cuidados médicos.</span><p></p>
<p>Lo más probable es que no sea así. Un bebé enfermo tiene muchas menos posibilidades de sobrevivir sin sun familia. Por ello, algunos programas como ""Un huérfano menos"" intentan <b>convencer a madres en riesgo de abandonar a su bebé de que no lo hagan. </b>Básicamente les dicen: ""Tú encárgate de cuidar a tu bebé y nosotros nos encargamos del resto"" y así lo hacen, consiguiendo los fondos necesarios para tratar al niño.</p>
<p>Para las mujeres que deciden seguir luchando la situación no es en absoluto fácil, normalmente tienen que mudarse de su pueblo a Shanghai para obtener los cuidados médicos que necesitan. Normalmente son mujeres que no han podido estudiar y que no tienen acceso a ningún tipo de ayuda de desempleo. <b>Es una situación insostenible a nivel económico.</b></p>
<p>Cuando vimos todo esto decidimos que queriamos <b>ser parte del cambio. </b>Lo que queremos ofrecer a las madres que se encuentran en esa situación es la posibilidad de generan ingresos para mantener a su familia mientras sus hijos están ingresados. Algo que puedan hacer junto a la cama del hospital, con poco espacio y medios. Así, hemos diseñado nuestro vestido y una colección de accesorios y ropa llena de pequeños nudos chinos que puedan producir para nosotros, desde el hospital: Eso es <b>""The Good Knot""</b>. Cada uno de los vestidos tiene siete nudos (tres en la chaqueta, dos en la falda y dos en la bolsa) y son suficientes para mantener empleada una madre durante un día y pagarle lo que necesita para vivir.</p>

The 3 reasons why you need The ONE dress right now


This dress will flatter YOUR figure. This was the challenge we gave ourselves: designing a dress that would look good on every woman. More than 50 real woman of all ages and sizes have already tried it on..and loved it! It is SO versatile that in one way or another it will for sure flatter YOU.

VERSATILE  for any occasion. We asked our friends to think about three occasions where they could use The ONE dress and they came up with the styles below, but with your own creativity, other pieces of your wardrobe and some accessories the options are endless!

It is made out of BAMBOO. If you have never experienced bamboo before, think about the softest, most comfortable and luxurious cotton you can imagine: That´s bamboo. It is also UV protective, hypo-allergenic and possesses anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties AND one of the most EARTH-FRIENDLY fabrics available. If you want to know more about bamboo fabric, please check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_textiles

 More importantly, The ONE dress is revolutionary because it represents a new life opportunity for mothers of very sick and disabled kids. Have you ever sat by a sick friend or a relative who is stuck in bed? Isn't it tedious? Now, imagine you have to stay there by your baby´s bed for weeks, even months waiting for a surgery or while her treatment is ongoing. Imagine that to make matters worse, you can not work so you can not support your family so your financial situation becomes critical. Then, staying by a hospital bed is not tedious anymore, it is desperate.  There are thousands of woman in this situation in China and our mission is to keep these women employed so they can stay at their child's side. However, there is not so much you can do by a hospital bed. We needed something small, easy to learn, valuable and hand-made. So we came up with The Good Knot: Accesories made out of knots and clothes that include knots as details and buttons. There are 7 of these life changing knots featured on The ONE dress and just ONE dress is enough to keep someone employed and paid for a day.   


What you get 
We wanted to create a dress that would help the ever running urban woman to go from the office to dinner afterwards. And the mom that doesn´t have much space for her own stuff in her suitcase anymore and needs a one-for-all dress. And specially create a dress  for the woman who cares: the one that doesn't want excess of fabrics polluting her land or exploited people producing her clothes. 

For all of them, for YOU, we have created The ONE dress: 


 

 
 

 
 
 



Check the coming up videos and our Pinterest board for more pictures of real woman wearing The ONE dress in multiple ways!



Choose the perfect color and the perfect size
The ONE dress is reversible and once the campaign is over you will have to choose among one of the following pairs of colors: 


 Dark blue and light grey
 Dark green and cream
Deep red and dark grey 
Black and White


 Once the campaign is over we will contact you to get your color and your size and be sure that your dress will fit you perfectly. These are the measures we will use just for reference, but don't worry if you don't find your size, we will of course do your dress, remember it is for EVERY woman:

Para las mujeres que deciden seguir luchando la situación no es en absoluto fácil, normalmente tienen que mudarse de su pueblo a Shanghai para obtener los cuidados médicos que necesitan. Normalmente son mujeres que no han podido estudiar y que no tienen acceso a ningún tipo de ayuda de desempleo. Es una situación insostenible a nivel económico.
Cuando vimos todo esto decidimos que queriamos ser parte del cambio. Lo que queremos ofrecer a las madres que se encuentran en esa situación es la posibilidad de generan ingresos para mantener a su familia mientras sus hijos están ingresados. Algo que puedan hacer junto a la cama del hospital, con poco espacio y medios. Así, hemos diseñado nuestro vestido y una colección de accesorios y ropa llena de pequeños nudos chinos que puedan producir para nosotros, desde el hospital: Eso es ""The Good Knot"". Cada uno de los vestidos tiene siete nudos (tres en la chaqueta, dos en la falda y dos en la bolsa) y son suficientes para mantener empleada una madre durante un día y pagarle lo que necesita para vivir.
 

Ese es el impacto que estás consiguiendo cuando compras nuestro vestido, una madre tiene un día más para cuidar de su bebé.

Riesgos del proyecto

Hemos dedicado meses a planear esta campaña y tenemos años de experiencia en la industria. Nuestro compromiso es ofrecer productos sólo de la máxima calidad. No obstante al enviar el vestido desde China a cualquier punto del mundo hay ciertos riesgos y el momento exacto de entrega dependerá de los requisitos y tiempos de las empresas de paqutería.

   What is Stoma Aid? Each month, tens of thousands of stoma bags are thrown away in the UK as they are no longer needed. We will collect these unused bags and distribute them to people in need in developing countries across the world. Money raised with your help will help fund:

A dedicated staff-member to oversee and manage the Stoma Aid project as well as volunteers.
A warehouse where stoma bags can be collected and stored.
Education about stoma care in developing countries across the world.

The project is supported by the Colostomy Association - a national charity that supports people with a stoma throughout the UK. 







    Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't give any money you can still help make Stoma Aid a reality.  Share our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media.
Tell your friends, families and colleagues about Stoma Aid.   Stoma Aid will change the lives of thousands of people across the world. Change someone's life and give them a #BagOfLife",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

the World’s Next Great Sports Event</b></p>
<p>Our team is seeking funding to create and launch the
Tour of America, a multi-stage standalone elite women’s cycling race that we
envision becoming the women’s counterpart to the Tour de France – the ultimate
test in the sport.  The first year’s race, tentatively scheduled for
late Spring of 2016, will travel from Boston to Washington D.C. in up to five
stages (the maximum allowed for a first year event), Beginning in its third
year, the race will rotate to different regions of the country every year.<br/></p>
<p>In future years, it will come to the south (Charlotte to Miami?), then the
Midwest (down the Mississippi from Minneapolis to New Orleans?).  We’ll go to the Southwest and Northwest
depending on which cities want to host it most. 
And it will grow each year, in both difficulty and length, eventually
reaching 10 to 12 stages. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1396449/files/20150419095540-Montage.jpg?1429462540"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Why it’s important<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>Cycling
is a universal pastime and the only activity that is a sport, a leisure
activity, a form of exercise and a means of transportation.  For this
reason, cycling as a sport is something that most anyone can watch and relate
to.  This is why the greatest event in the sport – the Tour de France – is
also the largest annual spectator event in the world.  But
only men compete in the Tour de France.</p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span>
<p>We believe the time has come for a comparable women’s
event that stands on its own and proves to the world that a challenging multi-stage women’s
cycling race can be just as compelling and exciting as a men’s event.  Last Spring’s Women’s Tour of Britain has
already begun to make that case, drawing over 350,000 on-site spectators.  </p>
<p><b>Much more than a race</b></p>
<p>This race will inspire girls and women around the
world, raising awareness of issues related to gender equality as it emphasizes
women’s empowerment, not just for America, but for the world.  The event will be accessible via the internet
as well as national and international broadcasters.  </p><p>Each day, millions of viewers will watch a
victorious woman step up on the podium, and a lot of those viewers will be girls,
many of them young women in lesser developed countries or oppressed societies who
are prohibited from going to school, driving a car . . . or even riding a bike.</p>
<p><b>We want to change that!</b></p>
<p>We believe that aspiration begins with
inspiration.  Sports can inspire like few
other activities, and the universal sport of cycling can deliver the images and
messages of empowerment in a way that no politician, company or other cultural
institution can.  </p><p>The Tour of America, on
its own, is not going to overthrow any dictatorships, but there are few things
more motivating than sports, and this race will engage men and women, boys and
girls at the grassroots level – the place where all social change begins.  The 2013 movie, WADJDA, provides a glimpse of the type of empowerment we are trying to unleash.</p><p>Official trailer from WADJDA:</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fs2Q2JvhWjyE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Ds2Q2JvhWjyE&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fs2Q2JvhWjyE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>The Tour of America will also serve as a great marketing
platform for companies seeking to recruit future women leaders, particularly in the
case of the tech industry.  We will also have a strong educational platform, with the goal of engaging girls in the STEM education fields to begin
balancing the gender disparity in related technology and scientific industries. </p><p></p><p>The event will be filled with activities along the
route and at the starts and finishes of each stage.  We’ll have expos, festivals, concerts,
caravans and viewing parties; it will be a celebration to kick off the summer,
a new tradition in American sports and a source of memorable gatherings of
families and friends as the race passes through towns large and small.  And you’ll be responsible for helping this
vision become a reality!</p>

test” – the pinnacle, marquee event that draws the most elite athletes in the
sport.  In the case of men’s cycling,
that event already exists:  the Tour de
France.  For this reason, a men’s Tour of
America will never achieve the same prestige and status as the Tour de France.  But for women, the opportunity awaits for The
Tour of America to become that counterpart – the ultimate test in the sport of
cycling for the greatest women cyclists in the world.</p><p><b>What your
contribution will do for us</b></p>
<p>Starting a major sports event is a challenging
endeavor, but a successful launch gives an event a tremendous amount of
credibility and value in later years. 
Your funding support will go directly to the operational execution,
marketing and broadcast of the Tour of America. 
Additionally, the presence of that support will also help our race get
sanctioned by USA Cycling and the UCI (The international governing body of
cycling), which means it will be on the sports calendar for 2016.  That alone will be a tremendous boost, giving
us the ability to bring in more funds through commercial partners, broadcasters
and investors.</p>
<p>Our team is ready to go, we have the support of the
best cycling managers in the world, the governing bodies of the sport, and some
of the top female athletes in cycling. 
Unlike other sports, we have some great advantages:  we don’t need to build a stadium and we don’t
need to sell tickets.  We just need the
funding to set up the route (logistics, traffic management, security), take care of our athletes, launch
the race and tell the world.</p>
<p>The route of the first year’s race, from Boston to
Washington D.C., will pass through the Northeast corridor – an area of 50
million people.  There is no charge to
watch the race, so this means we will potentially have one of the largest
on-site spectator events in history in our very first year, with at least a
million people watching.  As you watch
the race on TV, on your computer, on your phone, or in person, you’ll be able
to take pride in the fact that you helped make it happen!</p>

the World’s Next Great Sports Event
Our team is seeking funding to create and launch the
Tour of America, a multi-stage standalone elite women’s cycling race that we
envision becoming the women’s counterpart to the Tour de France – the ultimate
test in the sport.  The first year’s race, tentatively scheduled for
late Spring of 2016, will travel from Boston to Washington D.C. in up to five
stages (the maximum allowed for a first year event), Beginning in its third
year, the race will rotate to different regions of the country every year.
In future years, it will come to the south (Charlotte to Miami?), then the
Midwest (down the Mississippi from Minneapolis to New Orleans?).  We’ll go to the Southwest and Northwest
depending on which cities want to host it most. 
And it will grow each year, in both difficulty and length, eventually
reaching 10 to 12 stages. Why it’s importantCycling
is a universal pastime and the only activity that is a sport, a leisure
activity, a form of exercise and a means of transportation.  For this
reason, cycling as a sport is something that most anyone can watch and relate
to.  This is why the greatest event in the sport – the Tour de France – is
also the largest annual spectator event in the world.  But
only men compete in the Tour de France.
We believe the time has come for a comparable women’s
event that stands on its own and proves to the world that a challenging multi-stage women’s
cycling race can be just as compelling and exciting as a men’s event.  Last Spring’s Women’s Tour of Britain has
already begun to make that case, drawing over 350,000 on-site spectators.  
Much more than a race
This race will inspire girls and women around the
world, raising awareness of issues related to gender equality as it emphasizes
women’s empowerment, not just for America, but for the world.  The event will be accessible via the internet
as well as national and international broadcasters.  Each day, millions of viewers will watch a
victorious woman step up on the podium, and a lot of those viewers will be girls,
many of them young women in lesser developed countries or oppressed societies who
are prohibited from going to school, driving a car . . . or even riding a bike.
We want to change that!
We believe that aspiration begins with
inspiration.  Sports can inspire like few
other activities, and the universal sport of cycling can deliver the images and
messages of empowerment in a way that no politician, company or other cultural
institution can.  The Tour of America, on
its own, is not going to overthrow any dictatorships, but there are few things
more motivating than sports, and this race will engage men and women, boys and
girls at the grassroots level – the place where all social change begins.  The 2013 movie, WADJDA, provides a glimpse of the type of empowerment we are trying to unleash.Official trailer from WADJDA:The Tour of America will also serve as a great marketing
platform for companies seeking to recruit future women leaders, particularly in the
case of the tech industry.  We will also have a strong educational platform, with the goal of engaging girls in the STEM education fields to begin
balancing the gender disparity in related technology and scientific industries. The event will be filled with activities along the
route and at the starts and finishes of each stage.  We’ll have expos, festivals, concerts,
caravans and viewing parties; it will be a celebration to kick off the summer,
a new tradition in American sports and a source of memorable gatherings of
families and friends as the race passes through towns large and small.  And you’ll be responsible for helping this
vision become a reality!
Our Team
    Kevin Donovan – Founder and
President of the Tour of
America.  After a long career in sports
marketing both within a large corporation and at an agency, I started a company
called Renaissance Sports.  Our tagline
is Sport in Service to Humanity – we
believe that sports are a powerful facilitator of positive social change, and
that, in today’s world, marketing value is increasingly aligned with social
value.  The Tour of America is an ideal
expression of this principal.
    Lynn Morgan–
Lynn is our CEO.  She joined the Tour of America following a long career
at Cox Enterprises.  Prior to her most recent role as Vice President of
Marketing, Lynn served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Women’s
United Soccer Association from 2001-2004, where she achieved several
performance benchmarks during her tenure.  She was also responsible for
the launch of two professional sports teams within a 12 month period, and
overall management of the team’s successful corporate operations.
    Chris
Aronhalt – Managing Partner, Medalist Sports. 
Chris
and his company provide professional project management for all functional
areas of sporting, special and cause-related events overseeing all operational,
technical and participatory functions of an event from pre-planning through
post-event.  As one of the undisputed
leaders in their field, Medalist currently manages the entire operation of many
of the largest competitive cycling events in North America, including the Tour
of California, the Pro Cycling Challenge, and the upcoming 2015 UCI World
Championships in Richmond Va. 
Why not a men's Tour of America?Every major global sports event in the world has an “ultimate
test” – the pinnacle, marquee event that draws the most elite athletes in the
sport.  In the case of men’s cycling,
that event already exists:  the Tour de
France.  For this reason, a men’s Tour of
America will never achieve the same prestige and status as the Tour de France.  But for women, the opportunity awaits for The
Tour of America to become that counterpart – the ultimate test in the sport of
cycling for the greatest women cyclists in the world.What your
contribution will do for us
Starting a major sports event is a challenging
endeavor, but a successful launch gives an event a tremendous amount of
credibility and value in later years. 
Your funding support will go directly to the operational execution,
marketing and broadcast of the Tour of America. 
Additionally, the presence of that support will also help our race get
sanctioned by USA Cycling and the UCI (The international governing body of
cycling), which means it will be on the sports calendar for 2016.  That alone will be a tremendous boost, giving
us the ability to bring in more funds through commercial partners, broadcasters
and investors.
Our team is ready to go, we have the support of the
best cycling managers in the world, the governing bodies of the sport, and some
of the top female athletes in cycling. 
Unlike other sports, we have some great advantages:  we don’t need to build a stadium and we don’t
need to sell tickets.  We just need the
funding to set up the route (logistics, traffic management, security), take care of our athletes, launch
the race and tell the world.
The route of the first year’s race, from Boston to
Washington D.C., will pass through the Northeast corridor – an area of 50
million people.  There is no charge to
watch the race, so this means we will potentially have one of the largest
on-site spectator events in history in our very first year, with at least a
million people watching.  As you watch
the race on TV, on your computer, on your phone, or in person, you’ll be able
to take pride in the fact that you helped make it happen!
You will be our Founders!
What you get:
We have devised an assortment of very cool perks to
thank you and honor your support.  Note
that all perk levels listed below included the benefits of all lower level
perks:
$10 Contribution: You’ll be among the “Friends of the Tour” and placed
on our newsletter mailing list where you’ll receive updates on the development
of the Tour of America, notifications about special events and discounts on
Tour of America merchandise.
$25
Contribution:  The Tour of America
Pin.  The first ever Tour of America
commemorative pin will feature our Brand Identity (aka. our logo).  We’re very proud of our logo, and you may
have noticed that it’s gender neutral. The Tour of America logo is about great
athletes (who happen to be women), and it’s about moving forward, both
literally and metaphorically.
$50 Contribution:  The
Tour of America Pin Set.  This 3-pin
set, will most likely include the two versions of our logo (horizontal
and vertical) and a third “Year 1” pin that will reference the Boston to
Washington D.C. route.
$100 Contribution – A “Banner Brick” – You may be familiar
with the practice of selling engraved bricks with names on them to help fund
parks and buildings.  This is a variation
of that approach.  If you've ever watched the end of a large
cycling race, you've probably seen a lot of signs and banners with sponsor
brands on them, especially near the finish. 
Well, we’re going to put your name on those banners instead.  It won’t be very big (because we’re hoping to
get a lot of names), but it will be there, and when the race is finished, we’ll
cut your name out of that banner and send it to you as part of a commemorative
“Founding Fan” certificate (suitable for framing).  This is our way of thanking you for your
support and showing your friends, family and acquaintances that you were an
important part of getting this event off the ground.

<p>The BACKSEDATOR  sedates pressure points that activate pain receptors in various regions of the back.  It accomplishes this by utilizing 110 specifically placed pressure point applicators  that are designed to trigger nerve ending pressure points which activate a para-sympathic nervous system reflex response.  The end result is reduced internal pressure within the muscle and on nerves that create pain in return promoting regeneration of nerves and muscles to occur naturally at a faster rate with less associated localized pain.</p>
<p>Simply lay upon the BACKSEDATOR for 7-10 minutes, you will feel the pain and muscle tension slowly disappear as the pressure point applicators sedate hypersensitive and pressure activated nerves.  You will not believe how truly easy it is. ""IT SIMPLY WORKS""</p>

What you end up with is a unique one of a kind, natural, hand made, back pain and muscle relieving product.
The BACKSEDATOR  sedates pressure points that activate pain receptors in various regions of the back.  It accomplishes this by utilizing 110 specifically placed pressure point applicators  that are designed to trigger nerve ending pressure points which activate a para-sympathic nervous system reflex response.  The end result is reduced internal pressure within the muscle and on nerves that create pain in return promoting regeneration of nerves and muscles to occur naturally at a faster rate with less associated localized pain.
Simply lay upon the BACKSEDATOR for 7-10 minutes, you will feel the pain and muscle tension slowly disappear as the pressure point applicators sedate hypersensitive and pressure activated nerves.  You will not believe how truly easy it is. ""IT SIMPLY WORKS""

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My name is Alex Acevedo and I started the brand ""Uplift Apparel"". For those you that don't know, Uplift is a reggae-rock influenced clothing brand. I first discovered the reggae-rock scene about 6 years ago and immediately saw the love the artists had for each other and the fans. I had never seen any music scene like it. I dug deeper in the scene and discovered artists like Kings &amp; Comrades, Just Chill, and Iya Terra and was blown away by their music. It amazed me how these artists were not known across the country. I wanted to help spread this positive movement but I wasn't born with any musical talent, so that is why I decided to start this brand. Uplift is my way of helping with the movement. Since then, we have done everything we can to help emerging reggae rock artists in the scene. Every single band started off local, no band was known across the country overnight. They all had to struggle to make it to the top. My plan was to make their journey a little easier by promoting and spreading their music. I have done so by playing music clips on our Instagram, sponsoring artists, and even producing festivals focused on emerging artists. Uplift has barely scratched the surface. There are a lot more projects I plan to do in the near future. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<h4>What is the purpose of this Indiegogo Campaign?</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We (the Uplift crew) did a crowdfunding project to a few years ago to get Uplift started and with that project we were able to get some equipment for starters. Since then, the brand has been growing rapidly and there is some challenge with the equipment we have now to meet those demands. This campaign is to help us get a high end printing press. With this press we will be able to print shirts at a faster rate and will also be able to print multi-color designs. We will also be able to use our press to print for bands at an affordable rate. The profit we make off our sales goes towards projects geared toward helping the reggae-rock scene. We understand that times are tough at the moment. We appreciate any kind of support. A dollar does go a long way!</p>

<p><br/></p></a></span></h1><p>Hi there. </p><p>We are Yaus Games. We
are a manufacturing startup that specializes in gaming peripherals and
accessories for both analog and digital games. </p>
<p>Yaus Games was built on the
vision of its founder, Syed Khaled, who is an avid gamer all his life. Being a
20 plus year Magic the Gathering player and running a local gaming store <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/SpartanGamesArena/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SPARTAN GAMES ARENA</a>, kind of
solidifies him as a gaming nut.</p>
<p>A tournament regular all over
Asia, Syed hated carrying his cards in the deckboxes that is in the market
today, simply because they are too bulky, cumbersome to carry and don't  store
properly in the bags. This led to one hand being completely useless while you
are hanging on to your deckbox. Not to mention that current deckboxes bulge
once you store them in your bags which leads to very uncomfortable situations
especially when all you want to think about is the game.</p>
<p>The goal is for a
deckbox that is easy to carry around, store comfortably in your bag and still fit
your entire deck and sideboard. The deckbox must also be very durable and can
safely store the cards. </p>
<p>Introducing <b>YausBOX : The Deckbox Redefined.</b> </p><p>The YausBOX is folio deckbox that essentially splits the deck into
two so that it checks all of the storage issues above and making it comfortable and easy
to carry around. </p>
<p>Since most of the bags in the
market are designed to accommodate books and documents, it makes all the sense
why current deckboxes simply cannot fit in bags. Its like forcing a square peg into a round hole, it would eventually fit, but it would feel out of place. Hence
the YausBOX is designed to be able to fit in those spaces and not make the bag seems to be bursting at the seams. </p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/gyaHfYm.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""source: imgur.com""/><div>
<br/><p>Also the YausBOX  can actually fit in your pocket (medium to large sized ones). Especially good if you are into cargo pants.<br/></p>
<a href=""http://imgur.com/wUjZ6M6"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/wUjZ6M6.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""source: imgur.com""/></a>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We also wanted the YausBOX to be strong and sturdy, thats why we have chosen to use Polypropylene (PP)  plastic which is super durable and strong. In fact we engineered the YausBOX to withstand direct throws to the wall and off course drops on the floor. </p>
<p>With its Dual Clasp System, it ensures that your YausBOX will only open when you want it to. We have
designed these clasps to be strong but not difficult to open whenever you want
to access your cards. </p>
<p>Since the design of the YausBOX is folio, stacking them for storage is definitely easy. In fact you can stack
up two YausBOX quite easily in a regular bag. Stacking multiple YausBOX on the
shelves makes for a clean and simple look that is pleasing to the eyes.</p>
<p>Now you no longer have to make any concessions towards your comfort whenever you carry your cards. Since YausBox
is essentially a “book”, it feels natural to carry around in your hands.
With the texture of PP, it feels grippy and doesn’t feel that it is going
to slip out your hands easily. Even if it does, you know your cards are safe
and secure in the YausBOX. </p>
<p>Created with competitive and casual TCG
players in mind, YausBOX will fit 80 double sleeved cards or 100 single
sleeved cards (standard size). We designed the YausBOX so that putting in and taking cards out would be easy. The decks are fully exposed on one side so that you can use you fingers to lift the cards in one go very easily.</p>
<p>A card divider will be provided in each YausBOX to separate the mainboard and sideboard. YausBOX will also fit smaller sized cards as well, but there
will a little jiggle. </p>
<p>The Inner Ridge System prevents cards from transferring between chambers so that you can be confident that your precious cards are safe in their designated chambers at all times. </p>
<p>There is a space in between the chambers to accommodate dices, a small pen or marble or steel tokens. You'll be ready for your next epic battle with the YausBOX in your arsenal.</p>
<p>As an added bonus feature, PP is  actually dry erase friendly as well. This means that you can use dry erase or whiteboard markers to write on the YausBox to keep track of important information. *Do bear in mind that,it will cause the deckbox to stain a little, but nothing rubbing alcohol cannot clean*</p>

<br/>
<p>We are a husband and
wife team with a simple goal, to indulge the husband in his quest to bring
innovation to the gaming world (heh :D). After years of attending tournaments
locally and abroad, I realize that we needed an innovation in the deckbox department. Not just during tournaments, but after as well. Lugging around deckboxes in bags with its sharp edges and bulky size can get pretty uncomfortable, pretty fast.</p>
<p>I had an epiphany to create a deckbox that is flush after failing miserably to get to day 2 in a Magic the Gathering Grand Prix (T.T). Having to carry two deckboxes in my bag made it very uncomfortable and cumbersome. It was then I had an eureka moment. When the idea came, I couldn't get it out of my head and immediately got cracking on making this a reality.   </p>
<p>At first,
I have to admit, I grossly underestimated how to go about it. This is
because I thought “How hard can it be?” Boy I was wrong…</p>
<p>When we approached a local
designer to help me design the YausBOX, it was then we realized we had to address
many complications. We went through 3 initial designs process in which we had
issues with the height clearance, then we had issues with the locking mechanism
and a few other bumps along the way. </p>
<p>And things got worse after we 3D printed the box, we found other issues concerning user experience. The 3rd revision of the box was not comfortable to use so it was back to the drawing board to come up with a design that would meet our expectations.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458007610/joeuyc97g3tes7ah35z8.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 247.671px;height: 331px;""/>                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458007643/rw55azgvplgj6tjjzthg.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 245.427px;height: 328px;background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p>In the meantime, we met up with
several injection molding manufacturers to assist us in injecting the YausBOX.
It was then we had, yet again, underestimated the process. What type of
plastic to use? Which steel to use to make the mold from? , injection lead time
issues and many more other opportunities to learn came up (I’m being very
optimistic here). </p>
<p>When we finally submitted the 5<sup>th</sup> revision of the
box, the “injectors” told us that the design is flawed, it totally floored us.
At this point we were 5 months in, almost all of our savings are in the project
and we couldn’t move forward with the  production of the product. </p>
<p></p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458016161/ibwxjunxs3lmfjz97eqd.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 281.529px;height: 170px;""/>          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458016188/lkvbqh8u2rubf2zdoekf.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 278.796px;height: 169px;background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p>Luckily the Managing Director of
the company, a very nice and knowledgeable guy with 30 years of experience in
the industry, told us that the problem can be fixed but we still had to send
the design in for a revamp. </p>
<p>So we worked closely with an
industrial designer that he recommended. It was at this juncture we learned a
lot more about plastics and the process behind it. After about a month later,
the redesign was done. It was slightly thicker and taller than before. This is to ensure that there is no flex in the plastic. The designer created a dual clasp
system that would ensure the deckbox doesn’t open accidentally and secure the
cards in the box. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458016677/kt6mbrdvw22gytjm1woq.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 298.658px;height: 163px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458016776/ycjk87zgpi4vyfsinaex.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 321.165px;height: 175px;background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p>When we proceeded to 3D print after some minor changes, the
print came out perfect. Immediately we commissioned the mold to be
made. Then it was the start of the painful wait.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458016853/rsrvlbuwqgbk4uz7ijz1.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 193.696px;height: 258px;""/>             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458016890/pljypordfa3eqyc4os4z.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 345.011px;height: 259px;background-color: initial;""/></p>
<br/>
<p>After we passed the 6 weeks
projected time needed to tool the mold, we were already sweating our pants. We wanted to start the campaign by Christmas or at the very least at the start of the new
year but there wasn’t a working sample of the product and we wanted to be sure
of everything. Then when it got delayed a further 2 weeks, we went completely blank. </p>
<p>Then the call happened. The mold was ready and test prints was made. </p>
<p>However, unfortunately, we were disappointed with the result.</p>
<p>The product didn’t come out to
our expectation and we didn’t want to deliver a subpar product to our customers,
so it was back to the drawing board, and we realized that we missed certain
crucial elements again related to user experience.</p>
<p>Finally after an extra 2 weeks, a
total of 8 months since the inception of the idea, we have a final
prototype. We commissioned an adjustment to the mold and when the injector showed us the test print, we knew we had a winner. </p>
<p></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>This project literally took over our lives. We have poured all our savings, time, heart and soul into the project . I simply could not have done it without the help of my partners at Spartan Games Arena holding the fort for me while I pursue this dream. Now that we have done all the necessary work on the design and tooling, we are nearly <i>tapped out</i> in terms of funds. </p>
<p>We want to build Yaus Games as a brand that will continue to produce more innovative products down the line (We actually have a pretty kickass sleeve idea that we want to produce, but that's another campaign for another time) but in order to make that into a reality, we need to establish ourselves as a trusted company that can deliver on quality products and most importantly our promises. </p>
<p>Help us guys and get this project of the ground! Do contribute and share the campaign with your friends as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for time. Thank you for your contribution.</p>

</div>
</div></div>","Hi there. We are Yaus Games. We
are a manufacturing startup that specializes in gaming peripherals and
accessories for both analog and digital games. 
Yaus Games was built on the
vision of its founder, Syed Khaled, who is an avid gamer all his life. Being a
20 plus year Magic the Gathering player and running a local gaming store SPARTAN GAMES ARENA, kind of
solidifies him as a gaming nut.
A tournament regular all over
Asia, Syed hated carrying his cards in the deckboxes that is in the market
today, simply because they are too bulky, cumbersome to carry and don't  store
properly in the bags. This led to one hand being completely useless while you
are hanging on to your deckbox. Not to mention that current deckboxes bulge
once you store them in your bags which leads to very uncomfortable situations
especially when all you want to think about is the game.
The goal is for a
deckbox that is easy to carry around, store comfortably in your bag and still fit
your entire deck and sideboard. The deckbox must also be very durable and can
safely store the cards. 
Introducing YausBOX : The Deckbox Redefined. The YausBOX is folio deckbox that essentially splits the deck into
two so that it checks all of the storage issues above and making it comfortable and easy
to carry around. 
Since most of the bags in the
market are designed to accommodate books and documents, it makes all the sense
why current deckboxes simply cannot fit in bags. Its like forcing a square peg into a round hole, it would eventually fit, but it would feel out of place. Hence
the YausBOX is designed to be able to fit in those spaces and not make the bag seems to be bursting at the seams. 

Also the YausBOX  can actually fit in your pocket (medium to large sized ones). Especially good if you are into cargo pants.


We also wanted the YausBOX to be strong and sturdy, thats why we have chosen to use Polypropylene (PP)  plastic which is super durable and strong. In fact we engineered the YausBOX to withstand direct throws to the wall and off course drops on the floor. 
With its Dual Clasp System, it ensures that your YausBOX will only open when you want it to. We have
designed these clasps to be strong but not difficult to open whenever you want
to access your cards. 
Since the design of the YausBOX is folio, stacking them for storage is definitely easy. In fact you can stack
up two YausBOX quite easily in a regular bag. Stacking multiple YausBOX on the
shelves makes for a clean and simple look that is pleasing to the eyes.
Now you no longer have to make any concessions towards your comfort whenever you carry your cards. Since YausBox
is essentially a “book”, it feels natural to carry around in your hands.
With the texture of PP, it feels grippy and doesn’t feel that it is going
to slip out your hands easily. Even if it does, you know your cards are safe
and secure in the YausBOX. 
Created with competitive and casual TCG
players in mind, YausBOX will fit 80 double sleeved cards or 100 single
sleeved cards (standard size). We designed the YausBOX so that putting in and taking cards out would be easy. The decks are fully exposed on one side so that you can use you fingers to lift the cards in one go very easily.
A card divider will be provided in each YausBOX to separate the mainboard and sideboard. YausBOX will also fit smaller sized cards as well, but there
will a little jiggle. 
The Inner Ridge System prevents cards from transferring between chambers so that you can be confident that your precious cards are safe in their designated chambers at all times. 
There is a space in between the chambers to accommodate dices, a small pen or marble or steel tokens. You'll be ready for your next epic battle with the YausBOX in your arsenal.
As an added bonus feature, PP is  actually dry erase friendly as well. This means that you can use dry erase or whiteboard markers to write on the YausBox to keep track of important information. *Do bear in mind that,it will cause the deckbox to stain a little, but nothing rubbing alcohol cannot clean*
                                          






We are a husband and
wife team with a simple goal, to indulge the husband in his quest to bring
innovation to the gaming world (heh :D). After years of attending tournaments
locally and abroad, I realize that we needed an innovation in the deckbox department. Not just during tournaments, but after as well. Lugging around deckboxes in bags with its sharp edges and bulky size can get pretty uncomfortable, pretty fast.
I had an epiphany to create a deckbox that is flush after failing miserably to get to day 2 in a Magic the Gathering Grand Prix (T.T). Having to carry two deckboxes in my bag made it very uncomfortable and cumbersome. It was then I had an eureka moment. When the idea came, I couldn't get it out of my head and immediately got cracking on making this a reality.   
At first,
I have to admit, I grossly underestimated how to go about it. This is
because I thought “How hard can it be?” Boy I was wrong…
When we approached a local
designer to help me design the YausBOX, it was then we realized we had to address
many complications. We went through 3 initial designs process in which we had
issues with the height clearance, then we had issues with the locking mechanism
and a few other bumps along the way. 
And things got worse after we 3D printed the box, we found other issues concerning user experience. The 3rd revision of the box was not comfortable to use so it was back to the drawing board to come up with a design that would meet our expectations.

                        
In the meantime, we met up with
several injection molding manufacturers to assist us in injecting the YausBOX.
It was then we had, yet again, underestimated the process. What type of
plastic to use? Which steel to use to make the mold from? , injection lead time
issues and many more other opportunities to learn came up (I’m being very
optimistic here). 
When we finally submitted the 5th revision of the
box, the “injectors” told us that the design is flawed, it totally floored us.
At this point we were 5 months in, almost all of our savings are in the project
and we couldn’t move forward with the  production of the product. 

           
Luckily the Managing Director of
the company, a very nice and knowledgeable guy with 30 years of experience in
the industry, told us that the problem can be fixed but we still had to send
the design in for a revamp. 
So we worked closely with an
industrial designer that he recommended. It was at this juncture we learned a
lot more about plastics and the process behind it. After about a month later,
the redesign was done. It was slightly thicker and taller than before. This is to ensure that there is no flex in the plastic. The designer created a dual clasp
system that would ensure the deckbox doesn’t open accidentally and secure the
cards in the box. 


When we proceeded to 3D print after some minor changes, the
print came out perfect. Immediately we commissioned the mold to be
made. Then it was the start of the painful wait.

             

After we passed the 6 weeks
projected time needed to tool the mold, we were already sweating our pants. We wanted to start the campaign by Christmas or at the very least at the start of the new
year but there wasn’t a working sample of the product and we wanted to be sure
of everything. Then when it got delayed a further 2 weeks, we went completely blank. 
Then the call happened. The mold was ready and test prints was made. 
However, unfortunately, we were disappointed with the result.
The product didn’t come out to
our expectation and we didn’t want to deliver a subpar product to our customers,
so it was back to the drawing board, and we realized that we missed certain
crucial elements again related to user experience.
Finally after an extra 2 weeks, a
total of 8 months since the inception of the idea, we have a final
prototype. We commissioned an adjustment to the mold and when the injector showed us the test print, we knew we had a winner. 





This project literally took over our lives. We have poured all our savings, time, heart and soul into the project . I simply could not have done it without the help of my partners at Spartan Games Arena holding the fort for me while I pursue this dream. Now that we have done all the necessary work on the design and tooling, we are nearly tapped out in terms of funds. 
We want to build Yaus Games as a brand that will continue to produce more innovative products down the line (We actually have a pretty kickass sleeve idea that we want to produce, but that's another campaign for another time) but in order to make that into a reality, we need to establish ourselves as a trusted company that can deliver on quality products and most importantly our promises. 
Help us guys and get this project of the ground! Do contribute and share the campaign with your friends as well.
Thank you for time. Thank you for your contribution.

WHY SPLIT THE DECK?
Its the only way to achieve a flush design so that it could fit in your bag easily. We went with this concept so that carrying it around feels natural as well. This is the paradigm shift that we felt will resolve this need during and after play especially during tournaments. It took us about 1-2 seconds to load each chamber, and the YausBOX is designed to push the cards in place when it is about to close. 
WHY DOES A FULL DECK DOUBLE SLEEVED CARDS SEEMS TO NOT FIT PROPERLY?
This only happens if you recently changed sleeves and there is still air pockets in the sleeves. We actually designed it to clear 43 double sleeved cards per chamber (the 3 cards is allowance for clearance) however the air pockets puffed the cards even more. In fact for our measurements, we took a fully foiled double sleeved deck to ensure a perfect fit. Rest assured that there is enough clearance to fit the entire 80 double sleeved cards as advertised, simply compress your deck to let the air out and it will fit beautifully. 
SO IT CAN WITHSTAND FALLS, HOW HIGH?
Well honestly we didn't throw it from the 8th floor to test it out but we did however emulate accidental falls literally a few hundred times and threw the YausBOX against the wall as well. The YausBOX took it like a champ. Oh this is done in a fully foiled double sleeved deck as well. Our heart skipped a beat a few times every time we did it, but it was for the greater good.
I NOTICED SOME WHITENING AT THE SEAMS, SHOULD I BE WORRIED?
No you shouldn't. This is the characteristic of Polypropylene plastic when mixed with colour pigments and the whitening is a normal process. We have have an assurance by our injectors that the seams are rated at 100,000 openings before they start to fail. This is for both the dual clasp system seam as well as the seam that holds the bottom and top parts together.
I NOTICED SOME WHITENING AFTER A FALL, SHOULD I BE WORRIED NOW?
No, no you shouldn't. Again it is the characteristic of the plastic material used in conjunction with the colour pigments.

<br/><br/><p>Q: What is VR?</p>
<p>A: VR stands for Virtual Reality. Unlike real reality (the actual world in which we live), virtual reality means simulating bits of our world (or completely imaginary worlds) using a smartphone. Apart from games and entertainment, VR is used for training airline pilots and surgeons and helping scientists to figure out complex problems such as the structure of protein molecules.</p>
<br/><p>Q: What do I get when I purchase ClipVR?</p>
<p>A: You will get one ClipVR (black plastic or aluminum) depending on your backer Tier, with a carrying case </p>
<br/><p>Q: How do I use ClipVR?</p>
<p>A: First install one of the recommended VR Apps such as Google Cardboard, Jaunt, Youtube, VRSE, NYT, Orbulus, Discovery VR, etc. Turn the phone horizontally, start the App and attach the ClipVR in the center of your smartphone screen. Select content in the App and enjoy!</p>
<br/><p>Q: Will this work on my phone?</p>
<p>A: ClipVR works with any current smartphone. </p>
<br/><p>Q: Does the screen size of my phone matter?</p>
<p>A: No, we have designed our product to accommodate all screen sizes.</p>
<br/><p>Q: Why is ClipVR better than Google Cardboard?</p>
<p>A: ClipVR is small, portable and detachable. It can be taken out of a pocket and ready for use on a smartphone in a few seconds. With ClipVR, the phone screen remains accessible allowing fast, easy control of the phone and content. No loss of peripheral vision. Nothing to strap to your head. Look cool using ClipVR! </p>

</div></div>","OUR PURPOSE
At ClipVR we are passionate about virtual reality (VR) and the future of virtual entertainment.  We believe VR is the most immersive way to capture, share and enjoy media. Everyday, new VR content is published by companies such as the New York Times, Samsung, Jaunt and consumers on YouTube and Facebook for education, entertainment and promotions. However, there is a disconnect between captured content and viewing. For example with 360-degree cameras, users can film amazing video and photo content but there is a lack of ability to easily experience and share this immersive content as it was intended to be viewed! We are driven to create sleek, portable, accessible glasses that enable VR content to be viewed easily on your mobile device, any time, anywhere!

The simple design of ClipVR makes it portable, and compatible with ANY VR capable mobile device.

While we possess the skills needed for a great development process, we have noted from other campaigns on Indiegogo that things do not always go according to plan. Minor challenges such as shipping, customs or delays in production can cause unintended delays in our process. 
We will do our best to oversee every aspect of production in order to create the highest quality products and ship by our scheduled date. 
The team at ClipVR will keep you updated every step of the way through our journey!



YOUR SUPPORT

We need to raise $20,000 to continue refining our design, organize a mass manufacturing effort, and expand material and customization options for our customers. 
When you donate $19 or more, we will send you a ClipVR with early bird shipping. This means you get your ClipVR before we officially enter the market! 
In the higher tiers we include ClipVR t-shirts as well as the ultra-cool ClipVR Platinum, the aluminum framed version of our device.
At the top tier levels we offer early adopter access. If you want to get your hands on ClipVR as soon as possible, this tier is for you!  We will send you a ClipVR well in advance of the product's early bird shipping date. As an early adopter, you will be a beta tester who will provide valued feedback directly to the team. We want to hear from you and your help will shape the future of this project! At all backer tiers we will display your name in a special dedication section on our website to thank you for your awesome support!
If you cannot be a backer, no problem! We would love to get your help to spread the word about ClipVR through word-of-mouth or by sharing our story on all the social media sites. 

With your help, we can bring the world of casual VR to everyone!TIMELINE

FAQ


Q: What is VR?
A: VR stands for Virtual Reality. Unlike real reality (the actual world in which we live), virtual reality means simulating bits of our world (or completely imaginary worlds) using a smartphone. Apart from games and entertainment, VR is used for training airline pilots and surgeons and helping scientists to figure out complex problems such as the structure of protein molecules.
Q: What do I get when I purchase ClipVR?
A: You will get one ClipVR (black plastic or aluminum) depending on your backer Tier, with a carrying case 
Q: How do I use ClipVR?
A: First install one of the recommended VR Apps such as Google Cardboard, Jaunt, Youtube, VRSE, NYT, Orbulus, Discovery VR, etc. Turn the phone horizontally, start the App and attach the ClipVR in the center of your smartphone screen. Select content in the App and enjoy!
Q: Will this work on my phone?
A: ClipVR works with any current smartphone. 
Q: Does the screen size of my phone matter?
A: No, we have designed our product to accommodate all screen sizes.
Q: Why is ClipVR better than Google Cardboard?
A: ClipVR is small, portable and detachable. It can be taken out of a pocket and ready for use on a smartphone in a few seconds. With ClipVR, the phone screen remains accessible allowing fast, easy control of the phone and content. No loss of peripheral vision. Nothing to strap to your head. Look cool using ClipVR!",6.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hey Guys!</p>
<p>First of I would like extend my thank you to everyone and anyone that is reading this. My name is Brittany Williams born and raised and Dallas, Texas but  I currently reside in Miami,Florida. I am a 26 year old women who is trying to find her way in life! I always been a smart young lady, that has never has been closed minded or afraid to try new things.  After moving to New York in 2013 I was inspired by all of the fashion culture, from small independent brands to the huge ones! The people’s  nonchalant attitudes is what i loved the most, they didn’t care to wear what the wanted or start up a business of not knowing if it will succeed or starting a music career , or even the guys that danced on the train.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my brand NoVa Swim! Being originally from Dallas I am used to nice hot weather so when i moved to New York , I traveled a lot to Miami because I am so in love with water and I like being free. I enjoyed walking around in nice bikinis without any one judging you. The day after visiting Miami, I decided to start my own swim wear line but I wanted to make sure that the quality was perfect, Which was important because there are so many beautiful women that feel insur red about their bodies. I knew for a fact if I had great quality then they would feel more comfortable  wearing my product. I don’t wanna whole sale because that’s the easy way out, I wanted to design my own things, of course in swim wear you are going to have your basic styles but I want to give people something different, something where people will turn around to ask where that from! Most importantly I wanted something to call mines even if I make $200 off my whole brand, it is something that will be mines, something that I can pass down to my kids, something that will be able to grow forever. If there’s water on this earth, swim wear will always be in demand. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>After I decided to move forward with my brand I knew that I will need to get someone that was an expert in patterns and samples which if you know anything about being a designer you know that is EXPENSIVE! A lot of people don’t understand that samples cost about $100-$250 per sample. If that sample need adjustments then that’s another $100-250 until it’s the perfect fit. Same thing with patterns, patterns are your blue print to any new design. If your sample is wrong, it’s a 90%   chance that the patterns need work as well. After getting the patterns and samples perfect, you move on to grading which is sizing which cost about $100-$200. After that is completed we can’t forget packing which is really important because presentation is everything. Tags, hang tags, packing will run me from $500-$1000. Finally we have the marketing and promotion which includes photo shoots, makeup,venues, and hair and I will be looking at $1000. </p>

Hey Guys!
First of I would like extend my thank you to everyone and anyone that is reading this. My name is Brittany Williams born and raised and Dallas, Texas but  I currently reside in Miami,Florida. I am a 26 year old women who is trying to find her way in life! I always been a smart young lady, that has never has been closed minded or afraid to try new things.  After moving to New York in 2013 I was inspired by all of the fashion culture, from small independent brands to the huge ones! The people’s  nonchalant attitudes is what i loved the most, they didn’t care to wear what the wanted or start up a business of not knowing if it will succeed or starting a music career , or even the guys that danced on the train.
Which brings me to my brand NoVa Swim! Being originally from Dallas I am used to nice hot weather so when i moved to New York , I traveled a lot to Miami because I am so in love with water and I like being free. I enjoyed walking around in nice bikinis without any one judging you. The day after visiting Miami, I decided to start my own swim wear line but I wanted to make sure that the quality was perfect, Which was important because there are so many beautiful women that feel insur red about their bodies. I knew for a fact if I had great quality then they would feel more comfortable  wearing my product. I don’t wanna whole sale because that’s the easy way out, I wanted to design my own things, of course in swim wear you are going to have your basic styles but I want to give people something different, something where people will turn around to ask where that from! Most importantly I wanted something to call mines even if I make $200 off my whole brand, it is something that will be mines, something that I can pass down to my kids, something that will be able to grow forever. If there’s water on this earth, swim wear will always be in demand. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
 
After I decided to move forward with my brand I knew that I will need to get someone that was an expert in patterns and samples which if you know anything about being a designer you know that is EXPENSIVE! A lot of people don’t understand that samples cost about $100-$250 per sample. If that sample need adjustments then that’s another $100-250 until it’s the perfect fit. Same thing with patterns, patterns are your blue print to any new design. If your sample is wrong, it’s a 90%   chance that the patterns need work as well. After getting the patterns and samples perfect, you move on to grading which is sizing which cost about $100-$200. After that is completed we can’t forget packing which is really important because presentation is everything. Tags, hang tags, packing will run me from $500-$1000. Finally we have the marketing and promotion which includes photo shoots, makeup,venues, and hair and I will be looking at $1000. 
As for the funding I am looking about $5000-$6000.
I have 5 new design that I want to launch, below I will attach a photo of the invoices.
I can’t  say what I will do if I don’t reach my goal because I believe in my self and my brand that it hasn’t even crossed my mind at all because I know that if I am able to reach my goal that I can release a great brand that will continue to get better.
The Impact

The target market for NOVA SWIM is women between the ages of 18-35. NOVA SWIM fabric is flexible and flattering to a range of sizes from petite to plus size. The colors and designs chosen are to offer women a wide range of options. The fabric is high quality and will withstand sand, chlorine and ocean water maintaining it’s color and high quality feel. 
Also It’s really important for me to give back to the community some way. With that being said once I reach my selling goal the first month I plan on helping organizations in Miami.

<p>The average American uses 584 straws a year! </p>
<p>Straws lightweight nature makes it almost impossible to recycle them</p>
<p>A small gust of wind can send them airborne into the Ocean</p>
<p>In the ocean, plastics are physically harmful and toxic to wildlife</p>

<p>There are millions of straws used in the US each day alone, but every PATCO bracelet can eliminate thousands of them. Oceans are not the only thing we should worry about, however.

<p>We want to be a balancing influence in a frantic world of attitude and hype. The English are pretty rubbish at expressing emotion, but this does not mean that we are not an emotional bunch.

<p>We have spent the last 6 months finding suppliers of t-shirts and hoodies that meet our ethical, quality and style standards. We get all our t-shirts from one supplier and hoodies from another. Both of these suppliers have the highest ethical standards. We must be honest and say that we do not have the same supplier visibility in the skate deck company, but we are asking the necessary questions and working to find the best for you, using environmentally friendly bamboo as a starting block.</p>
<p>We have found some excellent local people to help us, the screen printing is being done in Gateshead and the laser etching in Blaydon.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As an avid reader, I'm always looking for something good to read. But if you're passionate about reading Black literature by American, Caribbean, and African authors like I am, then you know that great reads are not always easy to find. This is partially because of the lack of diversity in what's being published today. This is what prompted me to develop the Call Number subscription service which brings the latest Black literature to your door so that you won't have to go searching for great books--they'll come to you.</p>
<p>I am a professional librarian with vast experience selecting books for a library with a broad collection of materials about the Africana experience. As a result, I have a deep knowledge of Black literature and authors that I'm hoping to share with others who enjoy reading Black literature. Fun Fact: Many of our books are cataloged under <i><strong>PN 841</strong></i>, which is the call number for library books about Black literature.</p>
<p>With Call Number, I hope to promote diverse books, support Black literature, celebrate Black authors, and show an appreciation for libraries. I want to help subscribers build their own personal libraries and fill their bookshelves with great books.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To get Call Number off the ground, I'm hoping to raise $1750 which will help me cover the costs of a website and platform to manage the service, as well as allow me to print boxes and materials, and purchase books and curated items.</p>
<p>In order to do so, I've curated an exclusive box that will only be available to Indiegogo contributors. I'm excited to share with you a taste of what's to come with a monthly Call Number book subscription. Whether or not I reach the funding goal, anything given will still be used to launch Call Number. Every bit that you're able to contribute helps and I'm truly appreciative of your contribution to what I know is a one of kind book box!</p>
<p>The Founder's Limited Edition Box will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Clover</i> by Dori Sanders</li>
<li>""You're a Peach"" notecard by artist Lisa Congdon</li>
<li>Reproduction map print of Charleston Harbor, SC by Retro Printmaker</li>
<li>Four leaf clover antique silver tone charm</li>
<li>Maya Angelou Quotable Quotes mini quote card by Whimsicals Paperie</li>
<li>Library-themed bookplate sticker by Little Beane Boutique</li>
<li>Custom catalog card and spine label for organizing your personal library</li>
<li>Call Number branded sticker and bookmark</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My biggest challenge will be spreading the word about the Call Number book box and making it easy for avid readers of Black literature to find us and subscribe. I hope that people will not only see the value in promoting diverse books and well-written literature that happens to come from talented Black authors, but also feel compelled to invest in this unique subscription service.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help get the word out to anyone interested in literature! Like our Facebook page, follow us on Twitter and Instagram, share the Indiegogo campaign with family and friends, and sign up for our email list!</p>

To get Call Number off the ground, I'm hoping to raise $1750 which will help me cover the costs of a website and platform to manage the service, as well as allow me to print boxes and materials, and purchase books and curated items.
In order to do so, I've curated an exclusive box that will only be available to Indiegogo contributors. I'm excited to share with you a taste of what's to come with a monthly Call Number book subscription. Whether or not I reach the funding goal, anything given will still be used to launch Call Number. Every bit that you're able to contribute helps and I'm truly appreciative of your contribution to what I know is a one of kind book box!
The Founder's Limited Edition Box will include:


Clover by Dori Sanders
""You're a Peach"" notecard by artist Lisa Congdon
Reproduction map print of Charleston Harbor, SC by Retro Printmaker
Four leaf clover antique silver tone charm
Maya Angelou Quotable Quotes mini quote card by Whimsicals Paperie
Library-themed bookplate sticker by Little Beane Boutique
Custom catalog card and spine label for organizing your personal library
Call Number branded sticker and bookmark


Risks & Challenges
My biggest challenge will be spreading the word about the Call Number book box and making it easy for avid readers of Black literature to find us and subscribe. I hope that people will not only see the value in promoting diverse books and well-written literature that happens to come from talented Black authors, but also feel compelled to invest in this unique subscription service.

<p>At Dreamer &amp; Co we operate under the belief that consuming goods in a globalized economy should be more than about ourselves. As consumers we can play a role in improving the lives of others through conscious consumption. Therefore, we have formulated a business that seeks to provide consumers with products produced responsibly, ethically and transparently.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How We Work</strong></h3>
<p>We partner with a group of women artisans who have been trained to create handmade paper bead jewelry. We collaborate with a local non-profit organization that originally trained these women in skill and in business. The artisans have been successful selling their jewelry in country to expats and locals. Our hope is to help expand their work by offering jewelry made with their paper beads to a wider market.</p>
<p>We purchase the beads from the artisans at an ethical price in order to ensure they are earning a fair wage. We create designs that we are confident will sell to our target market. The jewelry is then assembled in the U.S. with the hope that we will be able to eventually hire re-settled refugees and train them to assemble the jewelry (we are dreamers—and we strive to make our dreams reality!). </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>We estimate our start up costs to be $10,000.  Your donation will help us fully launch Dreamer &amp; Co and will help cover the cost of supplying our initial inventory of beads purchased from the women artisans, legal fees, travel costs, initial start up advertising, and other overhead expenses.  All of the money donated will be directly invested in our mission: <strong>partnering with women in the Horn of Africa through business, helping them realize their potential and feel empowered, dignified, and in turn, flourish in their daily lives.</strong></p>

Automatic movement enables the watches to function without a battery.Why choose Flanko automatic watches?Flanko automatic watches can last a lifetime with proper care. There are no batteries, so there’s no need to worry about battery acid leaking and corroding the watch. Flanko includes a skeleton back, which acts as a window to clearly see the intricate components. All of our watches are hand-assembled, with a high standard of craftsmanship.At a time where mobile technology surrounds us, and everything is homogeneous, we bring the world a watch that goes back to the fundamentals by mastering the primary characteristics:""Timeless design, reliable movement, and hand-assembled for a nice, finishing touch.""We have spent years developing the design and worked side-by-side with other watch enthusiasts, upholsterers, and local designers. With their combined expertise, we crafted a watch that captivates the hearts of many.Here at Flanko, we put our minds together to create the timepieces that will withstand the test of time, and be cherished throughout the years.Our design is simple.

<p><strong>VRESH JEANS 2.0</strong></p> <p>So why the crowdfunding campaign? Because after the success of our original jeans, we’ve collected feedback from the community and consulted with designers &amp; production partners to create an even better product. VRESH JEANS 2.0 will introduce new colours, fabrics, sizes and features; all based on product research and experience. In short, they’ll be difficult not to love. With our first crowdfunding campaign that raised nearly € 18,000, we sold over 500 pairs of our original jeans- we must be doing something right. The new model will see an improved cut, new sizes that include 28-31 and, in addition to our popular Denim Blue, new colours that include Light Washed, Mid Washed and Shadow Black. If the campaign reaches more than € 30,000, two more colours will be introduced. Each pair of jeans is handmade in Europe and created with a top price-performance ratio in mind. They are cosy and durable, made only with the best fabrics sourced in Portugal by our team.</p>

<p> Did you forget your belt? No problem, our jeans come with a built-in belt to maximize comfort and minimize sagging. If you remove it, the holes are hidden and sewed together. Your jeans, your style – the choice is up to you!</p>

<p>Our range of sizes has grown so you can now choose between 28, 30, 31, 32 and 34. To guarantee a perfect fit, we’ve developed two different cuts:</p> <p>SLIM FIT</p>
<p>If you liked the ""Krew K-Slim"", this will be your favorite fit (TIP: go for a smaller size if you are into the “K-Skinny”). It’s the best choice for fans of the slim-fit look and this time we’ve made the cut even tighter (just a little).</p>

<h3>CALCULATION</h3>
<p>Cutting off the middlemen is a huge topic nowadays, but we go for more. Not only we should profit from our products, but everyone involved: The manufacturers are paid fair wages, the retailers get their stuff directly from us, our customers can expect the highest quality for a fair price and the environment benefits through durability and sustainable production. Since 2012, we are producing T-Shirts, Hoodies, Beanies and some other cool stuff.</p>

<h2><strong>Value</strong></h2>
<p>We’re committed to being involved in every step of the production process, from choosing the perfect fabric to putting the finished product into the customer’s hands. We make sure that manufacturers are paid fair wages, that production is environment-friendly, and that our high-quality products are sold at fair prices. Since 2012, we have been making jeans, hoodies, beanies and other cool products . We encourage retailers to order stock directly from us so that we can maintain a close relationship with our consumers.</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting our crowdfunding campaign. You can now put an end to your search for the perfect jeans by ordering a VRESH pair from us, or you can help us reach our goal by sharing it on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

Because after the success of our original jeans, we’ve collected feedback from the community and consulted with designers & production partners to create an even better product. VRESH JEANS 2.0 will introduce new colours, fabrics, sizes and features; all based on product research and experience. In short, they’ll be difficult not to love. With our first crowdfunding campaign that raised nearly € 18,000, we sold over 500 pairs of our original jeans- we must be doing something right. The new model will see an improved cut, new sizes that include 28-31 and, in addition to our popular Denim Blue, new colours that include Light Washed, Mid Washed and Shadow Black. If the campaign reaches more than € 30,000, two more colours will be introduced. Each pair of jeans is handmade in Europe and created with a top price-performance ratio in mind. They are cosy and durable, made only with the best fabrics sourced in Portugal by our team.

 Did you forget your belt? No problem, our jeans come with a built-in belt to maximize comfort and minimize sagging. If you remove it, the holes are hidden and sewed together. Your jeans, your style – the choice is up to you!

·         Sizes ranging from 28 - 34
·         Built-in belt (Don’t want this? We can easily remove it without any trace left behind)
·         Double stitching on the legs (More wear, less tear)
·         Metal rivets for enhanced durability
·         Subtle logo embroidery on the back pockets
·         Made with elastane for extra comfort
 

 
Our range of sizes has grown so you can now choose between 28, 30, 31, 32 and 34. To guarantee a perfect fit, we’ve developed two different cuts: SLIM FIT
If you liked the ""Krew K-Slim"", this will be your favorite fit (TIP: go for a smaller size if you are into the “K-Skinny”). It’s the best choice for fans of the slim-fit look and this time we’ve made the cut even tighter (just a little).
 REGULAR FITIf you liked the ""Levis 501"", this is the style for you. Our Regular Fit looks great on almost everyone and is really comfortable, even for long days at the office. This cut has been so perfect that we aren’t changing a thing.
 
CALCULATION
Cutting off the middlemen is a huge topic nowadays, but we go for more. Not only we should profit from our products, but everyone involved: The manufacturers are paid fair wages, the retailers get their stuff directly from us, our customers can expect the highest quality for a fair price and the environment benefits through durability and sustainable production. Since 2012, we are producing T-Shirts, Hoodies, Beanies and some other cool stuff.
 
 
Value
We’re committed to being involved in every step of the production process, from choosing the perfect fabric to putting the finished product into the customer’s hands. We make sure that manufacturers are paid fair wages, that production is environment-friendly, and that our high-quality products are sold at fair prices. Since 2012, we have been making jeans, hoodies, beanies and other cool products . We encourage retailers to order stock directly from us so that we can maintain a close relationship with our consumers.
Thank you for supporting our crowdfunding campaign. You can now put an end to your search for the perfect jeans by ordering a VRESH pair from us, or you can help us reach our goal by sharing it on Facebook and Instagram.
Yours in responsible fashion,

Blue was more than just a pet — she was Reid’s therapy dog after his father passed away. And every time she got out … well, you can imagine.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Fast forward ten years and Reid was a student at Georgia Tech working part time. His boss had a GPS tracker for his dog — but it spent all of its time on the charger because the battery didn’t last longer than a day. Every time the dog got out, the GPS was useless because it was too time-consuming to take the collar on and off daily for charging.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Knowing there was a better way to track pups, Reid took his idea to his business program at Georgia Tech and got to work designing, developing, and researching the idea with Aaron Naidu. At the end of the semester, the duo walked away with a working prototype, and Sniffer was born. Along the way, Austin Bush joined the team, becoming a full-time partner and founder, as well as the lead mechanical engineer for the company handling product design and manufacturing.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The American Humane Association estimates that 10 million dogs and cats are lost or stolen in the U.S. every year — and 700,000 of them never make it home. That’s because on average a dog can run 15-20 miles per hour, which mean your pup could be miles away in a very short amount of time. There are a lot of tracking products on the market, but none come close to the functionality, health monitoring, and battery life that Sniffer offers.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">We’re dog lovers but more importantly, we’re dog parents. And we take that role very seriously. That’s why we built Sniffer, because we sleep better at night knowing that we’ll never lose track of our family, and we know it’ll help you sleep better at night too.

Solar panels keep the collar working wherever there is light.WATER PROOFWe know dogs like to get dirty, so we made our Sniffer collar to keep up. It's waterproof in up to three feet for 30 minutes, so go for a swim.Dirty?

And with our buckle clasp, the collar can be easily removed at any time.CLASSY, CUSTOMIZABLE COLOR OPTIONSSniffer GPS comes in a variety of colors, including a community chosen Indiegogo color! A survey asking what color you want your device and collar to be, will be sent out at the end of the campaign. TECH SPECSMEET THE TEAMAaron Naidu (Chief Technology Officer), Reid Kersey (Founder + CEO), & Austin Bush (Lead Mechanical Engineer) Our journey with GPS dog collars started twenty years ago when our founder, Reid Kersey, had Blue, a puppy who just loved to get out. Blue was more than just a pet — she was Reid’s therapy dog after his father passed away. And every time she got out … well, you can imagine.Fast forward ten years and Reid was a student at Georgia Tech working part time. His boss had a GPS tracker for his dog — but it spent all of its time on the charger because the battery didn’t last longer than a day. Every time the dog got out, the GPS was useless because it was too time-consuming to take the collar on and off daily for charging.Knowing there was a better way to track pups, Reid took his idea to his business program at Georgia Tech and got to work designing, developing, and researching the idea with Aaron Naidu. At the end of the semester, the duo walked away with a working prototype, and Sniffer was born. Along the way, Austin Bush joined the team, becoming a full-time partner and founder, as well as the lead mechanical engineer for the company handling product design and manufacturing.The American Humane Association estimates that 10 million dogs and cats are lost or stolen in the U.S. every year — and 700,000 of them never make it home. That’s because on average a dog can run 15-20 miles per hour, which mean your pup could be miles away in a very short amount of time. There are a lot of tracking products on the market, but none come close to the functionality, health monitoring, and battery life that Sniffer offers.We’re dog lovers but more importantly, we’re dog parents. And we take that role very seriously. That’s why we built Sniffer, because we sleep better at night knowing that we’ll never lose track of our family, and we know it’ll help you sleep better at night too. So here’s to a safer future, where there’s no such thing as lost dogs.  TIMELINE BONUS PERKS!!! T-SHIRTSCLICK YOUR FAVORITEColors and sizes can be chosen in post-order survey





3 COMMON MYTHSFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS About the Device How is Sniffer GPS different from a microchip?   A microchip is like a dog tag, someone has to find your dog, take it to the vet or a shelter, and scan for the chip in order for it to work. This can take multiple days, and even then, complications with the chip can occur. Sniffer GPS tracks your dog’s location in real time, and alerts you immediately if your dog runs off, so you can find your dog in a matter of minutes. Is it waterproof?   Yes, Sniffer is IP67 rated, which means Sniffer GPS can be submerged in up to 1 meter of water (3.3 ft) for 30 minutes without damage. Feel free to let your dog jump in the water and go for a swim. Can I use Sniffer GPS with more than one pet?    Yes, each dog has their own profile within the Sniffer GPS app, and the app can track all your pets simultaneously. There is no limit to how many pets you can add under your account. Does Sniffer GPS attach to my cell phone plan?   No. No need to worry about adjusting your current cell phone plan. Sniffer GPS uses its own network that we provide. What is the warranty?   We offer a 1 year warranty on the device and accessories, as well as a 30 day money back guarantee. Can I choose a different color for the device and the collar?   Yes. After the indiegogo campaign, you will receive a post-order survey in which you can choose among the different color options for your order. Is my data secure?   Yes, all data is transmitted and stored fully encrypted. We utilize TLS to encrypt any data in transit, and all data is stored heavily encrypted on our secure servers, located on the AWS Cloud.Light up Collar Can I change the color of the collar’s light?   Yes. The collar’s light can display colors everything in the rainbow and can be chosen in the Sniffer GPS app. You can even tell it to flash one particular color or rotate through all the different colors! Is the collar washable?   Yes. Simply remove the device from the collar and throw it in the washing machine, solar panels and all. Do I have to use the included collar?   No, the device can attach to most collars up to 1.5in wide. However, since the included collar has the embedded solar panels for charging and the integrated high vis light, you would be giving up those features. Can I use Sniffer GPS on a harness?   Sniffer GPS will fit most harnesses and collars, however, because we can not guarantee a fit for everything, Sniffer GPS has a 30 day return window if it doesn’t fit your dog’s favorite harness or collar.Location Updates How accurate is the GPS?   Sniffer GPS is accurate within 3 feet. It also averages multiple locations together before updating you to prevent false alarms. Can I see my dog’s location history?   Yes, your dog’s location history is stored for one month, and you can view wherever your dog has wandered on the Sniffer GPS app. You can use this data to make sure your dog is actually getting walked by the dog walker, see all the places that your dog has traveled, or just see where they go when they wander.Subscription What does the subscription cost?   The first year of service is free for all of our backers. After that, it is only $5 per month, with no commitment. Why is a subscription plan required?   Our device uses cellular service to communicate with your phone, updating you as to where your dog is located. Unfortunately, this cell service comes at a cost, and so a subscription plan is necessary. Does Sniffer GPS attach to my cell phone plan?   No. You don’t need to worry about adjusting your current cell phone plan. Sniffer GPS uses its own network which works out-of-the-box with the device. Can I attach Sniffer GPS to my already existing phone plan?   No. Sniffer GPS uses a unique service plan of its own so that it can protect in a wide variety of places. As such, this plan must stay apart from any personal phone account. Does Sniffer GPS​ work in my country?   Yes. Sniffer GPS operates with dual mode LTE M1 and NB1 with a 2G(GSM/GPRS) fall back. This is a world certified mobile network device that really can operate almost anywhere in the world. Will Sniffer GPS work if I am outside cellular service?   The device’s GPS capabilities are always working, but if your phone is in an area with no cell service or WiFi connectivity, your phone will not receive updates from the device. The same is true if your dog is in an area with no cell service or WiFi coverage. However, multiple phones can receive the same dog’s location updates and while you might not be receiving updates in Antarctica, someone back home with the app can still know your dog is safe.Shipping and Handling What is the cost of shipping?   We offer free shipping to the United States. Shipping to other countries will cost a nominal fee that is displayed at the payment section. Do you ship internationally? What are the fees?   Yes. Since Sniffer GPS can work in over 194 countries, it is available to ship anywhere in the world. When you back our campaign, simply select your country and the corresponding shipping price will be listed. What is your return policy?   Our mission is for you and your pet to make the most out of every moment you share together. So it’s our hope that you are entirely satisfied with Sniffer GPS and its functionality. If for any reason you are not satisfied, we accept returns for a full refund (less shipping both ways) within 30 days of receipt, for unused products in their original packaging. Can I send a device as a gift?   Yes. Send us a message at contact@sniffergps.com with your name and order number and we will specially gift wrap your order before sending it out. Money back guarantee: What if the campaign goal is not met?   If the Campaign Goal is not met, everyone who purchased a Sniffer Collar will receive a full refund. Everyone who purchased a shirt, will still receive their shirt.Have other questions or any suggestions?Email us at contact@sniffergps.com",74.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>SCANDINAVIAN DESIGN &amp; SWISS ENGINEERING <br/>Our watches are created according to Scandinavian design principles: Functionality, simplicity and clean lines, and when it comes to watch-making, Swiss engineering is best in class. That‘s why it’s at the core of everything we do.  </p>
<p>WE ARE A TRULY INTERNATIONAL TEAM <br/>It all started in Brooklyn, NY. This is where our founder Igor Basargin joined up with Masashi Kawamura, a renowned Japanese Creative Director, to come up with the concepts of our watches. After successfully launching, we are now operating worldwide, with offices in New York, Switzerland, Vienna and Hong Kong. Our team is made up of multiple Nationalities.   </p>

<p>Risks and challenges <br/>We have an experienced team, plus we successfully launched Calendar Watch in 2016, which has been well-received and has much of the same materials and technologies; genuine leather, high-grade stainless steel, low energy Bluetooth and an E-paper display.</p>
<p>In addition, we have developed over time a great support network, so that where our team is less experienced, we can still deliver great products.</p>
<p>Demand Forecasting Risk</p>
<p>We’ve done our very best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan according to our previous experience. We are also going to be updating the plan in accordance with the Kickstarter success and demand.</p>
<p>Supply Chain Risk</p>
<p>We’re working with a very capable team, who successfully delivered the previous Calendar Watch project to market. Nevertheless, component delays and unexpected shortages are possible. If this happens, we’ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem.</p>
<p>Communication is key for us - just take a look at our previous Kickstarter campaigns and you will see that this was one of the aspects our backers liked the most about us!</p>

We build high quality watches that use just the right amount of technology to set us apart from both smartwatch and classic watch brands.  

SCANDINAVIAN DESIGN & SWISS ENGINEERING Our watches are created according to Scandinavian design principles: Functionality, simplicity and clean lines, and when it comes to watch-making, Swiss engineering is best in class. That‘s why it’s at the core of everything we do.  
WE ARE A TRULY INTERNATIONAL TEAM It all started in Brooklyn, NY. This is where our founder Igor Basargin joined up with Masashi Kawamura, a renowned Japanese Creative Director, to come up with the concepts of our watches. After successfully launching, we are now operating worldwide, with offices in New York, Switzerland, Vienna and Hong Kong. Our team is made up of multiple Nationalities.   


Risks and challenges We have an experienced team, plus we successfully launched Calendar Watch in 2016, which has been well-received and has much of the same materials and technologies; genuine leather, high-grade stainless steel, low energy Bluetooth and an E-paper display.
In addition, we have developed over time a great support network, so that where our team is less experienced, we can still deliver great products.
Demand Forecasting Risk
We’ve done our very best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan according to our previous experience. We are also going to be updating the plan in accordance with the Kickstarter success and demand.
Supply Chain Risk
We’re working with a very capable team, who successfully delivered the previous Calendar Watch project to market. Nevertheless, component delays and unexpected shortages are possible. If this happens, we’ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem.
Communication is key for us - just take a look at our previous Kickstarter campaigns and you will see that this was one of the aspects our backers liked the most about us!

We’ve set out to design the warmest shirt on the planet! One major challenge is how to keep warm but also to not overheat or sweat. Most of us layer up to keep warm, but then end up getting too hot. When resting or starting an activity, you’re cold, but when active, you can overheat. We thought, what if there was smart clothing that adapted to the body’s needs?<br/><br/>Here is the shirt that warms you when you need the heat, and doesn't overheat you! It warms you like multiple layers, but is lightweight and can be temperature adjusted to fit your needs. After many prototypes, design changes, manufacturer evaluations, performance tests, focus groups, and late nights...we’re thrilled to share the shirt that will keep you feeling just right no matter where you are headed!</p><h1>Blanc In The News</h1><div data-id=""22959407""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1542742324/wmrnmf1mlurkpjwdi79c.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h1> </h1><h1>Our Story</h1><p>Greg &amp; Chris here - We're two brothers that were raised high up in the Rocky Mountains and have become quite familiar with the feeling of being cold all too well.

The company is named after Mont Blanc - the highest peak in western Europe.Mount Blanc is a symbol of exploration which is home to hiking, skiing, paragliding, mountain biking, ice climbing, travel and on and on - to us Blanc is just that.Introducing The World’s Warmest Shirt - The Flare What Is The World’s Warmest Shirt?Oh boy, we were hoping you’d ask. We’ve set out to design the warmest shirt on the planet! One major challenge is how to keep warm but also to not overheat or sweat. Most of us layer up to keep warm, but then end up getting too hot. When resting or starting an activity, you’re cold, but when active, you can overheat. We thought, what if there was smart clothing that adapted to the body’s needs?Here is the shirt that warms you when you need the heat, and doesn't overheat you! It warms you like multiple layers, but is lightweight and can be temperature adjusted to fit your needs. After many prototypes, design changes, manufacturer evaluations, performance tests, focus groups, and late nights...we’re thrilled to share the shirt that will keep you feeling just right no matter where you are headed!Blanc In The News Our StoryGreg & Chris here - We're two brothers that were raised high up in the Rocky Mountains and have become quite familiar with the feeling of being cold all too well. Greg wanted to figure out a way to help people stave off the cold & as an engineer Greg started working on a technical shirt & built tons of prototypes. He started nailing down a really cool product. Greg brings the engineering and product design expertise to the table, while Chris brings experience in successfully launching products on crowdfunding platforms. Chris has launched two successful and Kickstarter and Indiegogo products and has a lot of experience from the top-down to get a campaign prepared and to get the rewards into your hands.With your help we can meet the production minimums and bring this product to life!Wait, why is this so warm and how does it keep me so warm?It’s equal parts dapper and technical. The feel and look of the shirt was designed to be wearable not just under your top jacket but on it's own too! It has low profile features that sneak in technology without screaming tech geek. Let’s start with the technical aspects of the shirt that make it so unique.Moisture is wicked out, heat is generated by middle layer and retained in.We’ve integrated a patented & lightweight battery powered carbon fiber heating technology throughout the shirt to keep your body warm for when and where you need it most. These heating elements use a carbon fiber technology that quickly heats up and efficiently draws minimal power. The carbon fibers are also non corrosive for a long lasting build that has been time tested so the shirt is durable + can be fully washed.Carbon fibers are the most durable & flexible heating fibers that can be packed tightly into tight travel bags.The shirt's power button is on the lower side, out of the way to avoid getting bumped and where it can be easily seen or felt to turn on.Heating Zones optimized for heating vitals.How does it feel? Feels like putting on a warm shirt right out of the dryer, but for hours!
How does it work?Three Warmth SettingsFrom lounging, traveling, or playing outside in nippy temperatures there’s a warmth setting that will fit just right. Keep your body warm in vital locations on your body at the right temperature with the touch of a button.There are three different warmth modes that can be used as a thermostat to cycle through the temperature that fits your needs. Switch between settings at the switch of a button.Low Warmth SettingSet the colored LED button to white and get hours of long lasting/steady warmth. Perfect for when you need a little extra warmth in a drafty movie theater, on an airplane, or at work.Medium Warmth SettingClick the colored LED button to advance to orange for the next warmth setting for an extra warmth boost. This setting is great for getting out the door on those early mornings with that crisp autumn air, at those chilly sporting events that go into double overtime, when you warm up for a run.High Warmth SettingOh Baby, it’s cold outside. The third heat setting is for when you really need furnace-like heat to curb the cold. This is what our ancestors dreamed about. Stay merry while on that family trip chopping down that perfect Christmas tree in the middle of the forest. Wear it under your jacket to keep toasty while on the ski slopes.A back pocket allows for carrying a phone, wallet, keys, power gel, or anything roughly the size of an iphone 7 plusThumbholes seal in the heat
The Included Power BankThe shirt comes with a strong 5000mAh power bank that packs a punch with a run time powering the shirt of up to 5 hours.The battery pack is lightweight and is about the size of an iPhone 6. The battery stores in the side pocket with room to spare. You won't feel the battery tugging the shirt down.Battery is light and the size of an iPhone 6.Using the standard USB connection you can also use larger power bank to power the shirt by placing it in the shirt pocket, in your pocket, or in a pack using the extra long USB cable.   Larger battery packs can be used and held in a backpack.The power bank can also be used to charge your devices when not heating the shirt - perfect for when a device like your phone needs a boost.    3X device charging. Standard USB Port.The power bank has a digital power level display for accurate power checking.LED display shows power level as a percentage.  Sizing (unisex)The shirt is available in sizes small, medium, large, and extra large. The shirt is stretchy and designed to fit both men and women.The sizes below are for both men and women.

<p>When designing our wallet we wanted to make sure it was super slim while having enough space for plenty of cards and cash. We wanted  our wallet to be easily accessible. A lot of the slim wallets we see on the market just jam a bunch of cards into one pocket, while that may make the wallet slim, you have to take all the cards out every time you want to use one, it's not very convenient or accessible.

Why? Hesalite has high impact resistance and does not shatter as glass does. In zero gravity, the possibility of having tiny bits of glass floating around in the cabin was considered an unnecessary risk for the crews and their spaceships heading to the Moon.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579006513/fzap4itasr9zm3ylgjuj.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>5.

We selected the 8215 as it's an acclaimed work-horse movement and a consistent choice with the tool-watch spirit we want to achieve while making sense on the industrial side: secured access for us (lead time and quantities) and can be modified in-house easily with a custom date disk ""roulette"" style and later on could be turned into a hand-wound only, etc...

With contacts in Switzerland, France, and China, she makes things happen anywhere, anytime. She loves lady timepieces from the 1960s. She hates cactus.</p><p><strong>Daniel &amp; Kenneth -</strong> Daniel learned design from Sir Dyson himself and takes care of the art direction while Kenneth, his magical side-kick, makes sure all design details work out. Kenneth's magical powers extend to photos and videos. Have you checked our Instagram?</p><p><strong>Sean - </strong>Our engineer. Experienced. Smart. When you asked ""Can we have a Hesalite glass box?"" he answers ""With inner or outer cyclops?"". He likes molecular cooking.</p><p><strong>Jessie &amp; Amélie - </strong>In the trenches, they make sure the components suppliers deliver the expected quality on-time.

Loves Serrano ham. Hates bad code.</p><p><strong>Marion - </strong>Our admin person. On the ground, she battles with the French administration to get the company up and running.

</ol><p>As you can see, the Skindiver WT Mecaquartz are pushed back while the Skindiver WT Automatic are a little bit back on track (for these without “beads of rice” bracelets and rubber straps.

The Skindivers WT Professional needs extra time to have their water resistance increased from 6ATM (like originally planned - that's why you may see 6ATM in previous communication) to 10ATM (as our engineer and Hesalite manufacturer found the way to make it happen). The case and Hesalite need to be re-engineered and thus we need to make new tooling and moldings which require an extra month.</p><p><strong>All and all, good things take time, especially quality watchmaking, and we can assure you our Skindiver worth the little extra waiting. </strong>These days, we all tend to forget the pleasure of waiting for something great.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585496569/mimbbesivbi9xjz5ifnn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>B.

WOLBROOK ORIGINSIn 1949, WOLBROOK watches and its sister brand DOUGLAS watches were born. Their most distinguished timepiece was a special tool-watch from the 1960s, nicknamed the SKINDIVER “WORLDTIMER” by collectors. With advertising in Life, Time, and Esquire magazines, these “incredible” watches – as they were called in the headlines - were renowned for their water resistance and were in fact sold in a water-filled container. Esquire Advertising June and July 1974 - Note: $19.95 USD would be around $350 to $450 in 2020, if you consider factors like currency appreciation, increased costs of labor and raw material.Then the “Quartz Crisis” in the 1970s happened…B. A UNIQUE TOOL-WATCH FROM THE 1960sA DOUGLAS Skindiver “Worldtimer” from the 1960s, owned and worn by a legendary test pilot, astronaut and engineer was recently auctioned and its authenticity was confirmed (Source: Heritage Auction). This tool-watch was worn by engineers and test pilots. A 1960s Skindiver tool-watch was recently auctioned and its authenticity was confirmedThe 1960s Skindiver “Worldtimer” was a solid, water-resistant and highly legible timepiece with luminous markers and hands, large sweep second hand, distinctive hour and minute hands, time zone, elapsed time and 24 hours indicators. This mix of features from a diving watch and a pilot watch makes it the kind of tool-watch “a NASA engineer and test pilot” would personally choose and wear.A test pilot flies countless aircrafts through his career. The fact that his Skindiver could accompany him in a cockpit is highly probable but which one is impossible to know and leaves a part of mystery. This is where history stops and the legend starts…C. WOLBROOK & DOUGLAS: THE TWO SISTER BRANDSWOLBROOK and DOUGLAS brands were two sister brands birthed in the 1940’s. To be more accurate WOLBROOK was the ""mother"" brand and DOUGLAS was the ""daughter"" brand, as inside DOUGLAS watches the movements and parts were signed WOLBROOK. This practice was common, with other renowned watch brands in the 1960s, where cases, movements and parts were shared among sister brands.Vintage Douglas and Wolbrook from the 1960sUnder WOLBROOK brand, DOUGLAS watches will embody the professional line; with key features like Hesalite glasses. DOUGLAS timepieces  (the ""Skindiver WT Pro"" during this campaign) will use essential colors for bezels and dials while WOLBROOK ones  (the ""Skindiver WT Auto"" and the ""Skindiver WT Mecaquartz"" during this campaign) will use more flamboyant combinations. Once more the dials will be signed Douglas while the other components will be signed WOLBROOK.With your help our mission is to bring back the Skindiver ""Worldtimer"" and Wolbrook as an independent watchmaker and a viable company to offer continuous support for yesterday's watches and to develop the ones of tomorrow's.D.

Skindiver WT Auto with beads of rice bracelet After being asleep for 50 years, WOLBROOK is being resurrected in France and once again these “incredible” SKINDIVER watches will be assembled there. To lead the way and to commemorate and celebrate mankind’s incredible achievements, with the X-15 and the Apollo 11 programs, the Skindiver “Worldtimer” is re-edited in 3 versions:See the details and other color combinations further below. A. SKINDIVER WT PROFESSIONAL - X-15 EDITION 1. The X-15: The NASA Ultimate Hyper-sonic Rocket-Powered AircraftAt the premises of the space race, before men looked up to the Moon, the first frontier was outer space. In 1960, to carry on aerodynamic researches, NASA engineers defined the requirements for an ultimate plane: a hypersonic rocket-powered aircraft capable of near space flight. The X-15 program was born.The X-15: The NASA Ultimate Hypersonic Rocket-Powered Aircraft. Here attached to a B-52 Mothership. PHOTO CREDIT: NASAFrom 1959 to 1968, through 199 flights reaching the maximum altitude of 107.8 km (67.0 mi) and the top speed of 6,206 km/h (3,856 mph) the NASA X-15 planes laid the ground work for spacecraft navigation. The 12 test pilots from the program were from the US Air Force and NASA, among these audacious and highly skilled pioneers where the man who would set the first foot on the Moon in 1969.The Skindiver WT Professional tool-watch X-15 Edition celebrates this incredible plane by featuring an engraving of the X-15 aircraft on its caseback, the iconic aeronautical industry line: “The proof is in the flying”.2. Skindiver WT Professional – Specs With an Hesalite glass, 5 color combinations and an automatic Citizen / Miyota movement, this version is the most faithful reedition for the watch passionate and space conquest fan. Like all professional line watches from WOLBROOK, these models boast DOUGLAS logo on the dial. We use three layers of pure C7 Super-LumiNova Lume which is the best solution without killing the daytime look.The Skindiver WT Pro is numbered and limited to 1969 pieces. 3.  Skindiver WT Professional CombosEach Combo is numbered and limited to 1969 pieces. The watch and bracelet combos are fixed. As it's too heavy logistic wise, the watch comes with the strap presented above by default. If you wish another bracelet, it is possible to add an additional one.4. FOCUS ON: Hesalite, The Space GlassWhile the WOLBROOK watches are fitted with scratch-proof sapphire crystals, the DOUGLAS - Skindiver WT Pro - models are equipped with an Hesalite glass. While the harder and more resistant to scratches sapphire crystal is a great choice for everyday adventures on earth, Hesalite glass has critical properties for space explorers.The Skindiver WT Pro is equipped with an Hesalite glassStarting with the Apollo program, NASA selected and provided watches to its astronauts that were sporting Hesalite glasses. Why? Hesalite has high impact resistance and does not shatter as glass does. In zero gravity, the possibility of having tiny bits of glass floating around in the cabin was considered an unnecessary risk for the crews and their spaceships heading to the Moon.5. FOCUS ON: Miyota 8215 Automatic MovementIn-house modified Miyota 8215 with a “roulette” style date disk and a solid movement holderThe in-house modification of the Miyota 8215 with a “roulette” style date disk – red for even days and black for odd ones on white background – and a setting of the 8215 at a tolerance of ±15 seconds per day (against -20/+40 when delivered by Miyota) are concrete examples of the uncompromising willingness to do things properly from what can be seen to what is barely observable.Why choose the Miyota 8215? We selected the 8215 as it's an acclaimed work-horse movement and a consistent choice with the tool-watch spirit we want to achieve while making sense on the industrial side: secured access for us (lead time and quantities) and can be modified in-house easily with a custom date disk ""roulette"" style and later on could be turned into a hand-wound only, etc... Higher specs movements would have increased the price, added availability risks or make the adventure a one-shot which is incompatible with our goal to bring back Wolbrook watches as a viable company.6. Skindiver WT Professional on the WristWrist size on the picture is 18.5cm. The straps presented are optional. B. SKINDIVER WT AUTOMATIC1. Celebrate The Moon Landing of 1969While walking on the Moon was quite something, successfully and manually land (on the Moon) the Lunar Module baptized Eagle was one of mankind's greatest achievements. PHOTO CREDIT: NASAOn the SKINDIVER WT AUTOMATIC watch APOLLO 11 EDITION, we celebrate and honor this endeavor with a case-back engraving of the Lunar Module “Eagle” in the landing configuration with both ascent and descent stages.2. Skindiver WT Automatic – SpecsWith a sapphire glass box crystal, 12 color combinations and an automatic Citizen / Miyota movement, this version is the modern reedition for the everyday gentleman. On the dials using white and vintages indexes, three layers of BGW9 Super-LumiNova Lume are applied. On the dials using green indexes, three layers of pure C7 Super-LumiNova Lume are applied which is the best solution without killing the daytime look.Each Combo is numbered and limited to 1969 pieces. 3. Skindiver WT Automatic CombosEach Skindiver is numbered and limited to 1969 pieces. The watch and bracelet combos are fixed. As it's too heavy logistic wise, the watch comes with the strap presented above by default. If you wish another bracelet, it is possible to add an additional one.Each Skindiver is numbered and limited to 1969 pieces. The watch and bracelet combos are fixed.

This is the very best of watchmaking in terms of sapphire crystals.5. Skindiver WT Auto on the WristWrist size on the picture is 18.5cm. Some of the straps presented are optional.C. SKINDIVER WT MECAQUARTZ1. Celebrate the 1st Moon Take-OffOn the SKINDIVER WT MECAQUARTZ wrist-watch APOLLO 11 EDITION, we celebrate and pay tribute to the successful take-off from the Moon with a case-back engraving of the Lunar Module “Eagle” in the taking-off configuration with the ascent stage only.2. Skindiver WT Mecaquartz – SpecsWith a flat sapphire crystal, 6 color combinations and a sweep second Mecaquartz movement from Seiko, this version is the present-day interpretation for the daily adventurer.  On the dials using white and vintages indexes, three layers of BGW9 Super-LumiNova Lume are applied. On the dials using green indexes, three layers of pure C7 Super-LumiNova Lume are applied which is the best solution without killing the daytime look.Each Combo is numbered and limited to 1969 pieces3. SKINDIVER WT MECAQUARTZ COMBOS Each Combo is numbered and limited to 1969 pieces. The watch and bracelet combos are fixed. As it's too heavy logistic wise, the watch comes with the strap presented above by default. If you wish another bracelet, it is possible to add an additional one.4. FOCUS ON: Seiko VH31 Mecaquartz MovementThe Seiko VH31 movement is a quartz movement with a sweeping central second hand moving in 1/4 of second increments which is similar to the one of a mechanical movement. The result? The best of both worlds: a watch with a sweeping second hand that won't stop for at least 2 years (Approximately 2 years of battery life). Seiko VH31 - ""Mecaquartz"" movement, a quartz movement with a sweeping second hand5. Skindiver WT Mecaquartz on the WristWrist size on the picture is 18.5cm.6. FOCUS ON: Assembled in FranceWOLBROOK and DOUGLAS watches were originally assembled in France and Switzerland. With the recent rebirth of the centuries-old French watch industry and proven industrial viability, it made total sense for WOLBROOK watches to be made once more in France. All the Skindiver watches presented as reward in this campaign will be assembled in France.With assembly in France, Wolbrook goes back to its original roots7.

With key in-house skills like design, engineering, components procurement and of course watchmaking, we have the know-how, the industrial solutions, the structure and the resources essential to craft quality timepieces and critical to the success of such enterprise. The team is composed of:Maximilien - The passionate brain behind the rebirth and relaunch of Wolbrook and the guy with a French accent on the video and 8 years experience in the watch industry. He loves vintage watches - mostly mechanical but as occasional crush on quartz -, burgers, and cats but not mixed together. He hates the watch designs that make no sense. Elva - Aka the ""Big Chef"" - She has 14 years of watchmaking experience and knows how to industrialize a watch concept like magic. With contacts in Switzerland, France, and China, she makes things happen anywhere, anytime. She loves lady timepieces from the 1960s. She hates cactus.Daniel & Kenneth - Daniel learned design from Sir Dyson himself and takes care of the art direction while Kenneth, his magical side-kick, makes sure all design details work out. Kenneth's magical powers extend to photos and videos. Have you checked our Instagram?Sean - Our engineer. Experienced. Smart. When you asked ""Can we have a Hesalite glass box?"" he answers ""With inner or outer cyclops?"". He likes molecular cooking.Jessie & Amélie - In the trenches, they make sure the components suppliers deliver the expected quality on-time. They can spot a quality defect on a sapphire crystal like owls spot mice in pitch black from 50m. They love cheese fondue. ""Mouss"" -  Our head watchmaker taking care of the assembly of the watches with his team of watchmakers. He engineers watch movements in his spare-time.Louis - Engineer and self-taught geek. He is our digital wizard. Words he hacked NSA on a lunch break once. Loves Serrano ham. Hates bad code.Marion - Our admin person. On the ground, she battles with the French administration to get the company up and running. She likes Thai salads with Chicken meatballs. She hates when the chicken meatballs are forgotten in her salad.Wolbrook & Douglas - Our two adopted stray cats. A mother and her daughter...A. GENERAL PLANNINGUPDATED ON 2020.05.09:With more than 30 years watch manufacturing experience shared in the team (with direct Kickstarter or Indiegogo experience on helping brands on that particular side), we were confident we could meet the deadlines of our ""Flight Plan"" further below and start to ship the watches from France by the end of May 2020 as follow:
May 15th, 2020 - Skindiver WT Mecaquartz 
June 15th, 2020 - Skindiver WT Automatic
July 15th, 2020 - Skindiver WT Professional
In between, the Covid-19 happened! While we planned for the usual production issues, we could not predict that one. This unprecedented situation has cost us most of our time margin.With France getting slowly out of the confinement period and a slower / more complicated logistic than usual, we had to re-organize and consolidate the assembly schedule and take into account the delays of the leather raw parts, “beads of rice” bracelets and rubber straps, we re-organized it as below:
June 20th 2020 - Skindiver WT Mecaquartz & Skindiver WT Automatic (both without beads of rice bracelet or rubber strap)
July 10th 2020 - Skindiver WT Mecaquartz & Skindiver WT Automatic (both with beads of rice bracelet or rubber strap)
July 25th 2020 - Skindiver WT Professional
As you can see, the Skindiver WT Mecaquartz are pushed back while the Skindiver WT Automatic are a little bit back on track (for these without “beads of rice” bracelets and rubber straps. We also expect the Skindiver WT Professional to be back closer to the original planning.Please be noted, that the situation linked to the Covid-19 is evolving day by day and extra delays might happen when we get to the assembly stage in France – where the virus is getting momentum - by the end of April / early May.Note: Why are the Skindiver WT Automatic and the Skindiver WT Professional planned later? The Skindivers WT Automatic are planned later because their double-domed sapphire with cyclops lens needs more time to be crafted. The Skindivers WT Professional needs extra time to have their water resistance increased from 6ATM (like originally planned - that's why you may see 6ATM in previous communication) to 10ATM (as our engineer and Hesalite manufacturer found the way to make it happen). The case and Hesalite need to be re-engineered and thus we need to make new tooling and moldings which require an extra month.All and all, good things take time, especially quality watchmaking, and we can assure you our Skindiver worth the little extra waiting. These days, we all tend to forget the pleasure of waiting for something great. B. PRODUCTION STATUS OF THE WATCHESCurrently, the components of the watches are in production. We have received the hands and the dials.Dials drying up after the layering of the Super-LumiNova.Production run dials and hands with C7 and BGW9 Super-LumiNova pigments on the testing bench. Check!Second handsMinute hands - Day time and night timeBroad arrow hour hands with vintage lumWe need your help to spread the word about our pre-sales and bring back Wolbrook and the Skindiver “Worldtimer”!Share one of our post or a story on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/wolbrook/), on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/wolbrook/), the link to the Indiegogo pre-sales page (Short link: https://igg.me/at/wolbrook-mechanical-automatic...) or a radio message. Take a screenshot and once the campaign is over, share it with us by email and we will add a watch tool to your pledge (value 10€)! Easy! A. SHIPPING & WARRANTYWorldwide shipping is included in our pricing. Please be aware that you are responsible for duties, fees, and taxes applicable in your country.Our watches are delivered with a 3-year warranty that covers the repair of any material or manufacturing defects. B. DISCLAIMERAs mentioned in Wolbrook's story: a Skindiver “Worldtimer” model was owned and worn by a famous test pilot and engineer.  His Skindiver tool-watch was recently auctioned and his brother confirmed its authenticity.As we have no certainty, we are not making any statement on any specific mission or plane. Our special editions are humbly paying tribute to outstanding mankind's achievments. We are sticking to the facts: this Skindiver ""saw action"" and by the look of it - wear and tears, faded marking on the bezel, along with a replacement military specs nylon strap - it did not stay in a  drawer. As many test pilot, astronaut or regular man through the 1960s and the 1970s owning a personal, extra or back-up watch on top of your standard issued watch was common sense and practice (Source: Hodinkee)C. Environmental commitmentsLong-lasting designThese watches can last a lifetime and more as long as they are: 1. Properly revised and maintained by a qualified watchmaker every 5 years. 2. Used in a normal way, for instance, they can't be used as a nutcracker.Reusability and recyclabilityAll watches are delivered with a pouch made of canvas and vegetable-tanned leather. All our packagings are using recycled cartons and can be recycled themselves. We choose not to use a traditional box that would be wasteful and costly for our environment. We also worked on the size to ensure efficient shipping and ""low cost"" for the environment.Sustainable materialsWe selected stainless steel as a base material for the watches. For now, we can not guarantee 100% the impact of the mining and transformation but at least all the metals used in our watches can be recycled. For our straps, we selected vegetable-tanned leathers that are less impactful on our environment than traditional leather that is tanned with chromium. For the nylon straps, we are using recycled nylon. For our packaging, all our watches will be delivered in a travel pouch made of eco-friendly canvas and vegetable-tanned leather, wrapped in a recycled carton.Environmentally friendly factoriesWhile we are strong believers that the watch industry as a long way to go, for our components, we choose factories with proper waste management. As seen, above we also tried to select the best raw material too. As a new player, we will try our best to move the status quo and environmentally friendly solutions will always our favor.Sustainable DistributionWe will try to have two to three shipping hubs to rationalize shipping: Europe, North America and Asia. We will update our backers on that point when we are ready to ship.Something elseWe believe all these are baby steps but they are at the very core of our values and we will try our upmost to enforce them. One small step...",60.0,0,"1 Campaign

Stephanie has a passion for designing functional yet sleek products while supporting and helping others to also ""Persu"" their dreams. She is an advocate of collaboration over competition, and a member of the latest cohort of female entrepreneurs in the F Project.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Story</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">""After launching my first Kickstarter campaign in 2015, I was thrown into the fast-paced world of entrepreneurship. While constantly running from meeting to meeting, and traveling consistently domestically and internationally, I saw that there were two crucial bags missing from my collection: a backpack, and a small essentials-only bag. I needed a backpack that would make my travels easier, keep me organized, last for years to come (the ones I was using broke easily), and still maintain a sleek, clean exterior. And, I needed a smaller bag that could hold just my essentials, be versatile enough to transition from day to night, and allow me to be hands-free -without looking like a sporty fanny pack.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">So, I spent the last 3 years designing two bags that could solve all these problems: the Ama Backpack and the Quila Bag. With a TSA-complaint laptop pocket in the Ama and over 20 features, this backpack can withstand the hustle and assist in all of life's work, travel, and leisure activities. And, the Quila Crossbody Belt Bag can be worn 3 ways, depending on how you need it, eliminating the need for multiple bags - all without compromising style.""</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>-Stephanie Su, Founder + Designer of PERSU </i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574493286/fzudk9hueo9sigshpb0s.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574493441/djevwujd4gswensckmks.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">I designed these bags for the modern-day hustler (and am also one myself), so this time, I'm taking my Kickstarter challenge as an opportunity to increase my personal growth. I often find myself moving so quickly through life that I often neglect to give time to myself on a daily basis. So, for the 4-week run of my Kickstarter campaign, I will release a new #modernhustlerchallenge theme each week and hold myself accountable to follow-through on the activities.

This time around, my two new bags are named after two equally important and extremely influential beings in my life. </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Ama Backpack:</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">The Ama Backpack is named after none other than my amazing 94-year old grandmother who helped raise me from the day I was born. Ama (阿媽) is what I call her and it means ‘grandmother’ in the Taiwanese dialect. Like many incredible grandmothers out there, my Ama is the strongest yet most selfless and caring person I know. After raising six kids alone in Taiwan, my Ama came to the US to help take care of her 3 grandchildren after their father passed at a young age. Shortly after, when I was born, Ama then came to our house every single day to care for myself and my two siblings. Ama communicated most with her actions due to speaking only Japanese and Taiwanese because of the Japanese Occupation of Taiwan in her childhood. We communicate in the only language we share, a limited version of Mandarin. </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">She never had a lot in terms of wealth, but she gave everything she had to everyone others and dedicated her entire life to help and care for those around her. I'll never be able to come close to matching what she's given me with her love, patience, sacrifice, and care, but I dedicate this backpack to my Ama -  ready to withstand anything the world could throw at her, and do it with ultimate class.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574493897/j7vhv3pbaevavmvl3jkh.png"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Quila Bag:</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">The Quila bag is dedicated to the partner in crime I had for half of my life: my chihuahua Tequila who passed away in March of 2018. </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Tequila (also nicknamed ""Quila"") was the first purchase I made after receiving my first paycheck at 16 years old and was the best thing to have ever entered my life. A small but confident little guy, he made home a home for me and was by my side through all the rough teenage years, the typical quarter-life crisis, and the rollercoaster ride of this entrepreneurship journey. He was by my side during the two weeks I was in the garage packing 800 bags from my first Kickstarter campaign in 2015. And, although he didn't make it to see the final prototypes of this one, he did see the making of it.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">So, I designed my new Crossbody Belt Bag in the spirit of Tequila. The lovely Quila is ready to be carried as a clutch or tucked under your arm as a shoulder bag, and can perform hands-free as a belt bag. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574494000/cyimu2djabnmb54j1d18.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">I hope you’ll feel as I do that these two new stylish and versatile bags are inspired by passion and the spirit of two truly incredible and amazing beings.  </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/io29oujxb48pwlc/AAC7C-7jJhybcJKSnq050kpqa?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574494064/wgsvmx8wrbzzqjhuenhl.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574494093/wznmah9tlkpm1yu4stcb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Please help us share the campaign!</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/persucollection/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574494116/m9izrsx8psmdzmhswc4q.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/persucollection/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Instagram: @persucollection</strong></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/persucollection/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574494129/doy0efnborhtkwovs9k8.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/persucollection/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Facebook: Persu Collection</strong></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://twitter.com/persucollection"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574494140/rlz0xyehmqnyr808fygr.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://twitter.com/persucollection"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Twitter: @persucollection</strong></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOqljhwtng9vLUTEg4gCLSA"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574494152/uqj0tru9m9af0sf6epqj.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOqljhwtng9vLUTEg4gCLSA"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>YouTube</strong></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.pinterest.com/persucollection/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574494165/zsfgnav2pt0tgsenv1t0.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.pinterest.com/persucollection/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Pinterest: Persu Collection</strong></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574494185/zrvmwnletore8y6pryi7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">I want to give a very special THANK YOU to everyone below.

It's an ideal set up for getting through TSA checks without having to pull out your laptop. With 7 different interior pockets ranging from soft-lined to see-through mesh, we have a place for all your valuables, tech accessories, and supplies:  The Quila Bag can be worn 3 ways: as a crossbody, belt bag, and clutchReady for many roles, the Quila bag can be used as a clutch for a night out, a crossbody for weekend brunch and client meetings, or a chic belt bag. Top handle allows for easy carry as a clutch. Gold D-rings allow you to attach the adjustable shoulder strap to turn this bag into a crossbody. With our adjustable vegan leather belt strap, the Quila bag can be turned into a stylish and hands-free bag that can be dressed up or down for everything from working events to running around with the kids. At PERSU, we know that having too many bells and whistles come at an aesthetic cost, and our solution has always been to design bags with the perfect balance of style and function. We include the functions you need, without the ones you don’t, in order to present you with gracefully designed, highly-functional bags with trim silhouettes and sleek materials for all your work, travel, and leisure activities.Persu Collection bags have been featured in:See what previous Kickstarter backers think about Persu:I spent the last 3 years carefully researching, developing and testing multiple iterations and prototypes to finally create the perfect balance of style, function, and durability. Here is the history...The Iterations of the Ama Backpack:The Ama Backpack went through multiple sketches/cad concepts, 2 different size options, 2 exterior back colors, MANY MANY function tweaks, and 3 shape designs before finally reaching the final, perfected golden sample. The Evolution of the Quila Bag:The Quila bag started off as a rectangular bag that evolved into a circular shape in order to have a more stylish look and improved belt functionality. I created and tested 4 samples to get to the final prototype.Prototype Testing:I personally tested every single prototype, while receiving feedback from hundreds of people over the last 3 years. I brought each prototype out with me on a day-to-day basis to ensure that each feature was necessary and useful - making tweaks to the prototype as needed. Tweaks that involved better placement for use, and increasing the ease of the functions. I also brought each prototype out on countless travels, testing the TSA-compliant compartment at many airports domestically, and internationally to ensure the function worked perfectly...and it did. :)  Final Prototypes Product Demo:Here is a simple, unedited continuous take demo of the final sample of the Ama Backpack and Quila Bag.After 3 years of R&D, I am finally ready to bring the Ama Backpack and Quila Bag to life and in your hands, and I just need your help in funding the first round of production. With the golden samples ready to go and a trustworthy, quality manufacturer already secured, we are just around the corner from introducing the only two bags you need for all your work, travel, and leisure activities!The Kickstarter goal is the minimum amount needed to produce these two new bags. If we are to exceed our goal and hit stretch goals, additional funds will go toward producing NEW COLORS of the Ama Backpack and Quila Bag that will include backers' feedback and suggestions. Together we can create beautiful, functional bags for our modern-day lifestyles. :)TIMELINE

I have found the love of my life. Creating beautiful premium leather accessories , purses.
I need a specialized sewing machine to continue to share my creations with the world. 


NO/R™ will feature  a new collection of original works inspired by contrasting concepts humanity is presented with as we continue this journey through life. To me each piece is reflection of moments in time an experiment with emerging technology wearable computers, lights, sensors and a fusion of the concepts of past and present due to my enchantment with merging everyday objects with technology.This will also be the introduction of my one-of-a-kind purse creations. I look forward to presenting the finished pieces in gallery form and encouraging discussion surrounding the concepts presented in my ready to wear, handmade luxury collection called DICHOTOMIA that is an exploration of the dichotomies of style and living by NO/R™ 


  What I Need   
I am looking to raise about $5000 for a Juki Single Needle Lockstitch Walking Foot Specifically Set up for Leather Sewing and other startup materials like leather, sculpting wax, mixed media, custom hardware and sewable electronics.




What I have been up to.
Introducing the Go! Convertible Clutch.This is one of the purses that form a part of the NO/R TOKYO COLLECTIONGrounded, yet filled with soul - each hand stitched leather good is practical and pretty. Inspired by the sights and sounds of Japan, the Tokyo collection features simple lines with timeless styling. The GO! purse can be worn 5 ways! This is one of my favorites . A convertible cross body purse, hand sewn hand-stained genuine leather! ___________________________

If i supercede my goal will still use the funds to purchase more material, dedicate to training  and apprenticeship of myself (And pursue my accepted apprenticeship with amazing artist, sculptor and jewelry designer Jolanta Pawlak ) and others in order to  continue designing and creating limited edition pieces and experiences. 
There will always be a limited number of each design available. Each one will be numbered.

</h1></span>
</div><div>
<p>The Free Home Project is a revolutionary movement that redefines homeownership. Our vision is to showcase affordable and sustainable technology in a treetop rainforest environment. By simplifying our material needs and thinking outside the traditional norms, we can eliminate virtually all monthly housing and living expenses, allowing us to reshape how we spend our time.  The 'Free Home' Project exemplifies how homeownership can “free” us, rather than trap us, by working less to support our needs and allowing more time to pursue our passions. The 'Free Home' will run on sustainable and renewable resources, has no monthly expenses and is nearly maintenance-free, yet provides everything we need to live comfortably - shelter, running water, electricity, entertainment. Green living does not mean having to sacrifice modern amenities, but it can mean having a debt free, low stress, high quality life!</p>
<p><b>Join Matt New and Amy Marino, members of the 'Finca Family' in their adventure of creating 'El Mirador Bellavista'</b></p>
<p>This one-of-a-kind jungle dwelling infused with modern-day comforts is located at <a href=""http://www.fincabellavista.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.fincabellavista.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Finca Bellavista</a><b> in the heart of the Costa Rican rainforest</b>.  The Finca Bellavista community is part of a broader international family seeking to challenge society’s norms.  We invite you to come live and learn with us (or should you choose, just kick back and relax) during and after the construction of 'El Mirador' at Finca Bellavista. Our pledge prizes are designed to help you be a member of our team as we demonstrate how we can live sustainably, comfortably, and responsibly in one of the most biologically diverse places on the planet.</p>

oriented, cares deeply for the local community, and is an adrenaline junkie that can be found surfing, dirt-biking or diving in the region surrounding the Finca.</p>
<p><b>Erica Hogan: </b>Co-founder and Creative Director</p>
<p>Erica is a kind, generous individual who brings sunshine to the
Finca even on a cloudy days. She loves Kimbo, her English Bulldog, more than anything (proof of her kindred spirit as only a mother could really love Kimbo!). Erica is the
brains behind the whole operation and continues to find innovative ways to keep

<p><b>Matt New:</b> Property Manager</p>
<p>Matt is a visionary with an entrepreneurial spirit who believes
wholeheartedly in the concept of the 'Free Home' Project. His role as Finca
Bellavista’s property manager has given him the experience and motivation to implement refined systems and technologies to take sustainability to a new level at Finca Bellavista. While he loves the jungle, he loves his
technology and gadgets too. He is the mastermind behind the Free Home Project. He knows you can still achieve your dreams in a way that minimises your carbon footprint. </p>
<p><b>Amy Marino: </b>Reservations Manager &amp; Volunteer Coordinator</p>
<p>Amy is a fun loving, unique person who brings out the best in
people. She loves the Ticos (Costa Ricans) very much and enjoys teaching them
English. She trains and looks after the volunteers and is awesome with the guests. Amy can be found assisting people in the office,
serving drinks at Happy Hour or enjoying a good book when the moment calls.  Amy is the spirit and glue that holds us all
together!</p>
<p><b>Rob: </b>Kitchen Manager and Chef</p>
<p>Rob is the world’s greatest chef, period. Many of us wonder if
we would still be here if not for his cooking. It will not go to his head
though, because Rob openly admits that he cooks for the compliments, and boy
does he get them! As Rob would say ""you can't fake thirds"". You only
have to troll the Tripadvisor page to see that the rest of the world
agrees! </p>
<p><b>Kimbo:</b> ‘Kimbo Slice’ is Mateo’s and Erica’s
English bulldog. Kimbo was adopted in San Jose and is a popular
character at Finca Bellavista. He can be a pretty endearing creature, yet also quite
the troublemaker as well. </p>

</div></div>","THE FREE HOME CONCEPT


The Free Home Project is a revolutionary movement that redefines homeownership. Our vision is to showcase affordable and sustainable technology in a treetop rainforest environment. By simplifying our material needs and thinking outside the traditional norms, we can eliminate virtually all monthly housing and living expenses, allowing us to reshape how we spend our time.  The 'Free Home' Project exemplifies how homeownership can “free” us, rather than trap us, by working less to support our needs and allowing more time to pursue our passions. The 'Free Home' will run on sustainable and renewable resources, has no monthly expenses and is nearly maintenance-free, yet provides everything we need to live comfortably - shelter, running water, electricity, entertainment. Green living does not mean having to sacrifice modern amenities, but it can mean having a debt free, low stress, high quality life!
Join Matt New and Amy Marino, members of the 'Finca Family' in their adventure of creating 'El Mirador Bellavista'
This one-of-a-kind jungle dwelling infused with modern-day comforts is located at Finca Bellavista in the heart of the Costa Rican rainforest.  The Finca Bellavista community is part of a broader international family seeking to challenge society’s norms.  We invite you to come live and learn with us (or should you choose, just kick back and relax) during and after the construction of 'El Mirador' at Finca Bellavista. Our pledge prizes are designed to help you be a member of our team as we demonstrate how we can live sustainably, comfortably, and responsibly in one of the most biologically diverse places on the planet.


THE FUSION HOME - 
""EL MIRADOR BELLAVISTA""
What makes this house so special?
Experience, research and technology! We live in the jungle and
we have a saying: 'The jungle always wins.'  Not anymore! 
Through testing countless products, we know we have designed and will build 'El Mirador' with the best materials and technologies available. Years of trial and error has taught us that the most appropriate products to use in this rainforest environment include recycled plastic, solar-powered technology and
renewable products. Pura Vida!  Our goal
is to share these hard learned lessons with you.
Aside from steel sub-framing, the dwelling will be built with the following materials: 
· 
Trex
Transcend (25 year warranty)
· 
Railing/Louvers/Siding
– Polypropylene
Water and Plumbing System 
· 
WISY
Pre-tank Filters
· 
WISY
Smoothing Inlets
· 
WISY
Floating Filters
· 
WISY
Overflow Devices Pumps
Rainwater will be collected with a rain catchment system. The slanted roof housing the solar panels will also divert water to a series of gutters for storage in an underground tank. A solar pump processes the water through a filtration system and provides potable water.
The Photovoltaic Solar System
· 
LED
Lighting
· 
Smart
Home System
· 
Solar
Water Heating System
The house will have door
sensors, cameras and a smart control system, allowing online monitoring. Opening and closing curtains, dimming the lights and unlocking the doors can all happen from a smart phone anywhere in the world. The solar system has been specially designed for the house and is capable of functioning with no sun for two days.

character at Finca Bellavista. He can be a pretty endearing creature, yet also quite
the troublemaker as well.

Such items will include, mastectomy bras, maternity options, shape wear, and hard-to-find sizes such as lower bands and higher cups. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(18, 26, 13); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Liberation Sans', FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; background-color: initial;"">Other notable services </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"">will include Made-To-Measure garments and alterations services on lingerie--something not commonly found in the US today. </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"">I would love to bring about the change that the Intimate Apparel industry needs by providing extensive alterations and consultations on lingerie regardless of where the purchase originated! Many companies complete alterations in-house or send the items to neighborhood cleaners, etc. only to get back botched items because of the lack of lingerie-specific knowledge the tailor possesses.  In other cases, lingerie alterations are being done ‘under-the-table’ by women that understand the construction methods but are working for a company that does not openly offer in-house alterations. Being another form of garment--intimates deserve the same care as the clothes we wear. </span></span></p>

Last but certainly not least, my love of giving back to those in need was a huge motivator. </div>

What We Want to Do

With your help, we hope to formally introduce ourselves to the fashion world. adrinADietra is a budding luxury lingerie brand that would love to offer items that are typically not available in a multitude of sizes in high end intimate apparel, but are still sexy enough to fit seamlessly in each core and seasonal collection. Such items will include, mastectomy bras, maternity options, shape wear, and hard-to-find sizes such as lower bands and higher cups. Other notable services will include Made-To-Measure garments and alterations services on lingerie--something not commonly found in the US today. 
I would love to bring about the change that the Intimate Apparel industry needs by providing extensive alterations and consultations on lingerie regardless of where the purchase originated! Many companies complete alterations in-house or send the items to neighborhood cleaners, etc. only to get back botched items because of the lack of lingerie-specific knowledge the tailor possesses.  In other cases, lingerie alterations are being done ‘under-the-table’ by women that understand the construction methods but are working for a company that does not openly offer in-house alterations. Being another form of garment--intimates deserve the same care as the clothes we wear. 
Before Alterations 
After Alterations 
For more images and information, view the Alterations on Lingerie  blog post available at www.adrinadietra.wordpress.com 

I was motivated to start this company due to the lack of options for alterations experts in the intimate apparel world, the want to provide more options for women that either have a difficult time finding their size, or are in need of something specific and have to decide to settle on the best--though not perfect, option they have found after scouring their city. Last but certainly not least, my love of giving back to those in need was a huge motivator. 
As a sales associate with two children, it is quite difficult to raise needed funds to gain momentum.  This initial fund will help establish the most basic, yet still crucial foundations for the company.

We plan to provide buyers and press with industry-specific packets.  These will provide information on current and future collections and allow for us to, vicariously, reach a greater amount of people and draw a more steady following.  Successful funding will allow for a full collection to be complete in a timely fashion.  This will then allow for revenue to come in to at least self fund another collection.  Eventually, we hope for it to grow enough to expand and build onto the company.

To accomplish all goals years down the line from this fundraiser would mean, we have successfully created a widely known, self-funding  luxury lingerie brand.  We will have started to set up funds to give back to the underprivileged and will have formed partnerships with related organizations to help their causes. {i.e. Breast Cancer Awareness, Homeless/Battered Women Garment Donations, etc.}
Being that our Creator/Head Designer can relate to the vast majority of issues we plan to address during the various stages of our company's growth {Very small band, larger/fuller cup size, recent mommy}, we have no doubt at the success of being able to genuinely express and push the necessity of what we are offering!



What the Money is For
These funds will be to help in several areas:
 1. Finalize samples and put into production the A/W 15 collection we are currently working on.
2. Create official business cards, press packs, etc. to hand out to various buying and marketing teams.

The breakdown is as listed below:
Fabrics & Trims . $15oo

Factory Production . $15oo

Labels, Tags, & Other Packaging . $5oo

Business Cards, Press/Buyer Packs, Lookbook . $5oo

Misc., { IndieGogo Fees, Perk Shipping Fees, Mistakes} . $2oo

Total . $4,2oo


Where We Are in the Process


Fabric, trim, and notion suppliers have been sourced. We need funding to finish our samples and start formal production
Production venues have been sourced
Pattern drafting has begun
Production samples have begun to be draped and sewn
Lookbook, buying sheet, and illustration packet layout and shoot planning has begun
Multiple press & buyer interest has begun to gather



So far, adrinADietra has made its rounds to 12 US states, 5 countries, and 3 continents around the globe via on and offline sales. We hope, within a minimum of 5 - 10 years, to grow enough to open our first brick-and-mortar boutique, in which custom fittings and alterations can be performed in person and allow for completed garments to be picked up and received in a more timely fashion.
We do know, initially, we will mostly have to focus on products that will gain the quickest following and will not have full availability for alterations or vast size/style range production. As the company grows, we plan to create pop-up shops and have trunk shows in both the US and Europe, to start, where in person fittings and alterations can be completed or dropped off! These trunk shows will allow us to gauge what styles of items and sizes are in highest demand.
Exceeding our funding will help towards gaining a studio space that we can rent monthly and have buyers preview and purchase collections, stylists review and pull for editorial shoots, and customers would have a place to have in-person fittings and alterations consultations.

We have already been featured in magazines such as W25 {Issue 45, Timor Razz's 'Sense' spread} and Inked Girls {September/October 2013 Issue}. We have been invited to be featured in several other well-known publications but lack of self funding has continuously stalled production. The success of this fundraiser will open the door for more clientele, buyers, publications, and stylists to become aware of our brand.

If the funds raised happen to fall short of our goal, we will at least use the money gained towards the two most major necessities-- purchasing fabrics and trims as well as producing our collection.

We thank you in advance for any contribution you give--be it monetary or by just spreading the word!
Thanks All ^_^Very Respectfully,
Team A.D

<p>Or, do you keep your gun loaded and in a “safe place” that is readily accessible to you in a crisis, but that you are just certain your children don’t know about?  <br/></p>
<p>As gun owners and parents ourselves, we faced the same problem you do: how to balance our desire to be both ready in a crisis and responsible in normal, everyday situations. <br/></p>
<p>The Veri-Fire Team is uniquely equipped to solve this problem.  We have a broad range of experience spanning U.S. Military, law enforcement, firearms and special tactics, small business startups, large-scale government contracts and acquisition management and Silicon Valley corporate program management.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Or, do you keep your gun loaded and in a “safe place” that is readily accessible to you in a crisis, but that you are just certain your children don’t know about?  
As gun owners and parents ourselves, we faced the same problem you do: how to balance our desire to be both ready in a crisis and responsible in normal, everyday situations. 
The Veri-Fire Team is uniquely equipped to solve this problem.  We have a broad range of experience spanning U.S. Military, law enforcement, firearms and special tactics, small business startups, large-scale government contracts and acquisition management and Silicon Valley corporate program management.
We invented Guardian to solve the challenge of responsibly securing handguns while maintaining unprecedented readiness.





Veri-Fire Guardian is the first product of its kind. 
Guardian is not a smart gun.  It is a safety device that attaches
to the trigger guard of your handgun via a custom adapter.





Guardian's spring-loaded, light-weight, metal slide physically blocks access to the trigger of your handgun when pulled to the rear and locked.







When an authorized user authenticates via fingerprint, Guardian unlocks allowing the slide to snap forward granting access to the handgun trigger.





Guardian is self-contained, can store up to 5 user profiles and comes equipped with a manual override in the unlikely event of a malfunction or expired battery.






The final production version of Guardian (shown above) will include the following features:

With Guardian, your handgun can be unlocked and ready in less than a second and reliably secured just as quickly.

Do you have additional questions? 
Check out our extensive FAQs page for answers. 
Also, visit our Handgun Compatibility List to see if Guardian is compatible with your handgun.




""As a Father, a Husband and a Police Officer I would ask any gun owner to take a look at the Guardian by Veri-Fire."" - Mark Ashby, 20-year Law Enforcement Veteran

""Guardian isn't a gun. It's an add-on that fits most standard handguns, and locks the trigger until the owner unlocks it with their index finger...if Veri-Fire raises the money it needs to get Guardian out to market, the effect could be the same: To keep kids from accidentally shooting themselves and each other.""

- The Daily Beast
""...roughly 32 million handguns could benefit from a lock like the Guardian, and if even one percent of those gun owners attach a lock to their weapon, that’s 320,000 more guns that toddlers can’t fire. It’s a gun safety approach so basic, even the NRA is tentatively on board.""
- Popular Science


Over the last six years, we've poured our lives into creating Guardian and we couldn't be more proud of the product today, but if Guardian saves just one life it will all be worth it.








We have refined Guardian through eight different iterations and five different designs to be the best product it can be.


 We are ready to move Guardian into final design and production, but to manufacture a product like this is expensive.  In order to bring Guardian to market, we need your help.
Join us and together we can change the way the world views gun safety.




 We know this is bigger than ourselves and we look to you, responsible gun owners and community members, to be a part of this journey with us.  In order to bring Guardian to the world, we need to raise a minimum of $100,000 to cover a portion of the upfront manufacturing costs.

Whether we reach our goal
or not, we are committed to bringing Guardian to the world.  Any remaining amount needed will require
business loans or access to other sources of large-scale funding.  However, banks and investors need to see that
supporters like you demand this product.

As a thank you for your early support, we've created some great perks at incredible discounts! 




Maybe you don’t have the ability to support monetarily but, like us, believe in this solution and want to change the way the world views gun safety.  This is the very reason we created the Guardian referral system. This system enables you to get perks (including Guardian) and even achieve membership in our exclusive key community without spending a single dollar.  

All you have to do is sign up for an Indiegogo account (required to receive credit for your referrals) and start spreading the word!  Click below for details on how to make and track referrals:
https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/203660683-How-To-Participate-In-A-Referral-Contest


The success of this effort will require a vast community of supporters who are ready to do whatever they can to ensure its success.  If you are unable to participate in the referral system, then watch this brief video on how to invite your friends to like the Veri-Fire Facebook page.


When we reach our goal, the $100,000 will be used to cover a portion of the upfront manufacturing costs..  We can only begin to pay the remaining manufacturing cost and cost of operations (like our salaries) once we exceed our goal.

Keep an eye out for secret stretch goals.  We'll reveal those one by one once we reach our initial goal.  Check back with this campaign page or look for our updates via email and social media for details.


Reaching our funding goal will enable us to execute our planned production schedule.  There are a lot of moving pieces to this effort and many opportunities for unexpected delays from our suppliers and manufacturers.  That said, we have the experience to mitigate risk and manage this process to the best possible outcome. 


Assuming minimal delays, our current production schedule would put Guardian in your hands by July 2016.






Our team members have led security operations for multi-billion-dollar nuclear weapons, managed multi-million dollar projects, and consulted in the private sector.  We’ve managed programs in both the corporate and government sectors.  Our team has a collective 40 years of large-scale project management and over 75 years of leadership, management, administrative, budgetary and business expertise.  
But, at the end of the day, we are like you.  We grew up on farms and in the suburbs, have lived in small towns and big cities, served in the military, both in the states and abroad, but, most importantly, we are parents.  Parents who would protect those we love at all costs and own handguns for that very reason.  



Our mission is to save lives and we are dedicated to that effort.
Over the last 6 years there have been many challenges and we know there will be many more to come.  That said, we understand having the privilege of an idea that can change the world as we know it and the responsibility to bring it to you.
That said, we recognize that this idea has the potential to change the way the world views gun safety and the responsibility that this places on us. 
Our commitment to you is that Veri-Fire Guardian will be the highest-quality firearm safety device that you've ever owned.  As such, we will warranty Guardian for 1-year from the date of delivery.

DVINE - FUSION COSMETICS

A New Premium Cosmetic Concept  DVINE is creating a new generation of cosmetics, bringing the Purity, the High Tolerance and the Sustainability from the Biological Side with the Performance, the Effectiveness and the Luxury of the Classical Philosophy, materializing in luxury eco- sustainable products with high quality and... very sensual.

Products focused on skin’s youthfulness with privileges for all senses: texture, touch, colour... aroma!




Sparkling colours, masterful textures and an enriched aroma profile with notes of Port Wine for a unique and eccentric cosmetic genome.


PORTWINE DNA - Douro Nuclear Aroma
Port Wine is a sweet and fortified liqueur wine, produced exclusively in the Douro Valley. 
The Douro Valley is not a vineyard area whatsoever! This is the only place in the world that produces Port wine. Do you know many regions that are the source of unique products in the world?!

When visiting this region you must notice what we can visually call the Douro's brand image: the terraces slopes! Douro's architecture is not by chance. There our view achieves a very unique region in pure state, which combines the strengths of the soil, weather and Man's handwork. Local communities have adapted to the territory's specific conditions, in many aspects hostile to life, transforming them into survival factors.
The soil is stony shale, the temperature ranges are huge, the terrain is rough, cut by numerous rivers and mountain streams.
It is not easy for plants to develop here. So, Man gave them a hand by creating these terraces slopes that house the vineyard but one thing is certain: the vines and vineyards that revenge here have a brutal sap vitality. They are rich in its constitution and the grape's varieties are improved. This explains the identity strength of the area's natural elements. And these are the elements we bring to the products!
Being the world of cosmetics a worship world of beauty and uniqueness, we felt we had to create the DVINE! The first oenological line with the aromas of Port Wine. Without pseudoscience, without giving in to market trends or advertising hyperboles.

   What We Need & What You Get   We are not asking for much, the primary need is for a camera,for better quality pictures and videos (600 €). In the near future we will need an online shop(400 €), a computer (500 €) and a studio (500 €)The amount could be around 2000 € .

<br/><h3><div style=""color: #CD9F7A;"">The idea</div></h3>This campaign
is about help, joy and relationships. It’s based on my own story when I was on
business trip and on the way back prior to flight at huge international airport
I was unable to buy any present for my 5 year’s old son. In the whole airport there
was only one and very little toyshop and I was unable to buy anything there. The
rest of shops were only chocolate or perfumes or alcohol.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I’ve felt
desperate and really embarrassed when I’ve came home. Just imagine those big
awaiting eyes of your child when you return home after long journey. Of course
he or she is happy they see you. But a while later they await something, some
little present you’ve brought them, some proof you’ve thought about them when
you’ve been away. And when you give them that little present the joy in their
faces is priceless... And that night they fall asleep with their new present
and are thinking with love about dad or mom...</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442865044/aglhdbbrdr5cicoygddl.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 324.446px; height: 198px;""/> <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>And this
story has brought me to an idea how to help people to make others a bit more happy...

<div style=""color: #CD9F7A;"">
<b>So what this project is all about?</b><br/>
</div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443723981/qyzxxtcfvcogggmbnnwl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>This
project is about little presents for your beloved ones or your business
partners. The presents should be high quality models of transportation
vehicles like planes, locomotives, cars, ships etc. 

<p>Now you can
say what’s the difference? Your question is very legitimate – there are millions
of models around at every toy shop.</p>
<p>The
difference is in the following basic points:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span>quality of our models – if you
really look on common models at toy shops they are quite low quality and often
plastic ones or at best mixture of plastic and metal. Our models will be metal  only
and of high quality.<br/><br/></span></li>
<li><span>design of our models – they will be painted
in one color only giving the model attractive look that not only children will
be proud of, but it will serve as a very representative present for adults to place
it on their work desk as luxury accessory. (even general manager is still man
and we all know every man is boy deep in the heart :-) )<br/><br/></span></li>
<li>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><span>and
last but not least our models will be available in vending machines at airports
or train stations etc. where you can easily buy it 24 hours a day 365 days a
year during your journeys. Another sale spots will be gas stations, subway and train stations, hotel
souvenirs shops and of course e-shop.</span>

</ul>

<br/>
</div> <div> <h3><div style=""color: #CD9F7A;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</div></h3> <p>We have the aim to make this thing global - have it at every important airport and other places so that we can help millions.</p>
<p>Why do we need such high sum?</p>
<p>As almost every perk includes model, just to cover perks high sum is needed. But to cover only that production the project couldn't go actually live. And we want to make it really live so that not only we can be proud every time somebody buys our product as present to make somebody happy, but we also want to make <b>you </b>proud being the supporter. Everytime you would see somewhere the product being sold you can say to yourself: ""I've helped!""</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<div style=""color: #CD9F7A;""><b>What we need to cover:</b></div>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>production costs of models - this is the highest expense<br/>
</li>
<li>tailor made fully automated internet connected vending machines</li>
<li>the whole multilingual e-shop system</li>
<li>mobile apps for iOS and Android</li>
<li>marketing costs<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<div style=""color: #CD9F7A;""><b>What will <b>you </b>get?</b></div>
<p></p>
<p>Participation and perks. As we really want you to be part of the project, we've involved some special perks - not only special editions but also limited editions nobody else would have right to buy. Grab them till they are available.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p><b><i>Model itself</i></b> - made from metal only of size of about 6"" (15 cm) with stand.</p>

<br/>
<b><i>Little book</i></b> - the
book should describe basic information about the vehicle with photos from real
life and any interesting data. This way the owner of the model can have much
better idea about the thing. For example did you know that big jumbo consumes 64
200 gallons of fuel for 9 200 miles? That’s a lot. But even with such a huge consumption it is more efficient than to drive that distance by usual car
(counted with 2 persons in one car for that distance)!<p></p>

<br/>
<b><i>Box itself</i> </b>- it
not only will look great and very deluxe. It also is practical where child can
store his treasures after taking out his model. By
the way the box will be of perfect prism shape so you can easily pack it into gift
paper and it will look then as ideal present – next time you’ll be
shopping notice how many toys are being sold in blister packages – when one
tries to pack it he will wind up in a messy looking something.

(our box)<br/><br/>We'd like to set the price at as most affordable level as possible. It should cost $13-$15.<br/><br/><br/><b><div style=""color: #CD9F7A;"">E-shop and Mobile app</div></b>The plan is
to support the vending machines with good e-shop so one can easily buy any
models also online and not only on airports or train stations. 

<p>In order to
be able to follow the models line, we have a plan to build a mobile application
for iOS and Android where one can store information what models he already owns
and what other  ones he’d like to have.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442348564/zsrh9dhdpmnhoifdsvlv.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 159.225px; height: 326px;""/></p>The app
will be online and offline solution. Yes, in today’s world offline solutions
are very rare. But the point here is it’s better to use some memory in one’s
smartphone and being able to study and go over models during flight and get
much more reality of what one has just bought for his beloved one than just to
sit and wait for landing and internet reconnection.

<p>And every
time one is online the app switches into online mode, downloads news, new
models etc.</p>

One can create his own profile either online on
web (in e-shop) or in the app where he can store information what models he
already owns and models he wishes to have – he just puts them into wish list.
And it really wouldn’t matter if you’ve just marked ownership of new model in
the app or via web as it will synchronize with each other.<br/><br/><br/><b><div style=""color: #CD9F7A;"">Why name ThetaGifts?</div></b>Maybe
one of your questions is why the name <b>Theta</b>Gifts?!? <br/><p></p>

do. They should bring about or support better <b>relationships</b> with your beloved ones or your friends or business partners. They should
represent you in the <b>soul</b> of the person
whom you’ve presented one of our models. Every time he or she sees it they remember
you, <b>think</b> of you.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444241376/prhcqaqxvo8jwn4t9p7f.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div> <div> <h3><div style=""color: #CD9F7A;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</div></h3> <p>
</p>
<p>The project
is basically very easy and with our experiences in business and customer’s
attitude we are quite sure we’ll keep everything what is written here.</p>
<p>There is a
risk of delay caused by our intention to get really high quality product and so
we have to put lot of stress in product detailed designing that way factory
will be able to produce it in such quality.</p>
<p>We do not
expect any big challenges regarding goods registration or customs. <br/></p>
<p>There is challenge to keep the price hopefully everywhere at approximately same level. It depends very much on local taxes and conditions of particular airport.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<div style=""color: #CD9F7A;""><b><h3>FAQ</h3></b></div>
<p></p>
<p><b><i><span>1.<span>  </span></span></i></b><b><i>What material will be the models
made from?</i></b></p>
<p>Metal alloy composed of zinc, aluminium and copper. This is standard
alloy used for manufacturing of metal models. Special and limited editions could be made also from other materials.<br/></p>
<p><b><i><span>2.<span>  </span></span></i></b><b><i>What’s the business strategy?</i></b></p>
<p>As it is stated above in project description – the main business
strategy will be built on sale via vending machines, e-shop and retailers (toy
shops, gas stations, present shops, souvenir shops etc.) There will be two main distribution
points – one in the USA and one in the European Union. The rest of the world will be
covered from those two points at the beginning. Later there will
be very likely more distribution points.</p>
<p><b><i><span>3.<span>  </span></span></i></b><b><i>What will be the price of models?</i></b></p>
<p>All the standard models will have the same price. The plan is to keep as
low price as possible – according to the data what we’ve gathered it should be around $
13-15. There is lot of factors influencing the price – local taxes, rent at
airport, brand fees, maintenance, employees etc., but it all should be fine
within the price stated above. In case of any radical local conditions in some
single cases the price can be different.</p>
<p><b><i><span>4.<span>  </span></span></i></b><b><i>At what airports you’d like to
start?</i></b></p>
<p>We’d like to start at some of the busiest airports in the world, but it
also depends on logistics and some other factors. There anyway will be kind of
pilot run at some airport (probably Vienna airport which has traffic more than
20 million of<span>  passengers annually. In
USA it should be Tampa, Florida (traffic of about 16 million of passengers
annually). Right after pilot run we’ll jump on big airports - namely London
Heathrow (almost 65 mil. passengers per year); Frankfurt, Germany (49
millions); Atlanta, USA (no. 1 in the world with it’s 80 million passengers per
year); JFK New York (53 millions); Chicago (70 millions) etc.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>5.<span>  </span></span></i></b><b><i>What models will you start with?</i></b></p>

We’d like to release 10 types of models in first
wave. There we definitely would like to cover well known planes like Boeing 747, Airbus A380 and some army planes like F16 or SU-27 Flanker as well as other significant aircrafts. We welcome any proposals to fit your desires.<br/><br/><p><b><i>6.<span>  </span></i></b><b><i>Will you directly cooperate with vehicle producers?</i></b></p>Yes, in every case where it will be possible including any license rights and fees and information right from source.<br/><br/><br/><h3><div style=""color: #CD9F7A;"">Our team<br/><br/>

</div></div>","Tired from searching for interesting gift?
Do you always buy chocolate, alcohol or perfumes?

Do you really hit expectations?


We want to help you to get right gift for your beloved ones, friends or business partner. Say goodbye to frustration from boring gift-hunt and hello to happy beloved ones and friends.


The ideaThis campaign
is about help, joy and relationships. It’s based on my own story when I was on
business trip and on the way back prior to flight at huge international airport
I was unable to buy any present for my 5 year’s old son. In the whole airport there
was only one and very little toyshop and I was unable to buy anything there. The
rest of shops were only chocolate or perfumes or alcohol.



I’ve felt
desperate and really embarrassed when I’ve came home. Just imagine those big
awaiting eyes of your child when you return home after long journey. Of course
he or she is happy they see you. But a while later they await something, some
little present you’ve brought them, some proof you’ve thought about them when
you’ve been away. And when you give them that little present the joy in their
faces is priceless... And that night they fall asleep with their new present
and are thinking with love about dad or mom...

 

And this
story has brought me to an idea how to help people to make others a bit more happy...






So what this project is all about?

This
project is about little presents for your beloved ones or your business
partners. The presents should be high quality models of transportation
vehicles like planes, locomotives, cars, ships etc. 

Now you can
say what’s the difference? Your question is very legitimate – there are millions
of models around at every toy shop.
The
difference is in the following basic points:


quality of our models – if you
really look on common models at toy shops they are quite low quality and often
plastic ones or at best mixture of plastic and metal. Our models will be metal  only
and of high quality.
design of our models – they will be painted
in one color only giving the model attractive look that not only children will
be proud of, but it will serve as a very representative present for adults to place
it on their work desk as luxury accessory. (even general manager is still man
and we all know every man is boy deep in the heart :-) )

and
last but not least our models will be available in vending machines at airports
or train stations etc. where you can easily buy it 24 hours a day 365 days a
year during your journeys. Another sale spots will be gas stations, subway and train stations, hotel
souvenirs shops and of course e-shop.







  What We Need & What You Get We have the aim to make this thing global - have it at every important airport and other places so that we can help millions.
Why do we need such high sum?
As almost every perk includes model, just to cover perks high sum is needed. But to cover only that production the project couldn't go actually live. And we want to make it really live so that not only we can be proud every time somebody buys our product as present to make somebody happy, but we also want to make you proud being the supporter. Everytime you would see somewhere the product being sold you can say to yourself: ""I've helped!""

What we need to cover:


production costs of models - this is the highest expense

tailor made fully automated internet connected vending machines
the whole multilingual e-shop system
mobile apps for iOS and Android
marketing costs




What will you get?

Participation and perks. As we really want you to be part of the project, we've involved some special perks - not only special editions but also limited editions nobody else would have right to buy. Grab them till they are available.


  Details

Product description

Model itself - made from metal only of size of about 6"" (15 cm) with stand.







Little book - the
book should describe basic information about the vehicle with photos from real
life and any interesting data. This way the owner of the model can have much
better idea about the thing. For example did you know that big jumbo consumes 64
200 gallons of fuel for 9 200 miles? That’s a lot. But even with such a huge consumption it is more efficient than to drive that distance by usual car
(counted with 2 persons in one car for that distance)!



Box itself - it
not only will look great and very deluxe. It also is practical where child can
store his treasures after taking out his model. By
the way the box will be of perfect prism shape so you can easily pack it into gift
paper and it will look then as ideal present – next time you’ll be
shopping notice how many toys are being sold in blister packages – when one
tries to pack it he will wind up in a messy looking something.
(usual blister packaging and as present)
(our box)We'd like to set the price at as most affordable level as possible. It should cost $13-$15.E-shop and Mobile appThe plan is
to support the vending machines with good e-shop so one can easily buy any
models also online and not only on airports or train stations. 

In order to
be able to follow the models line, we have a plan to build a mobile application
for iOS and Android where one can store information what models he already owns
and what other  ones he’d like to have.
The app
will be online and offline solution. Yes, in today’s world offline solutions
are very rare. But the point here is it’s better to use some memory in one’s
smartphone and being able to study and go over models during flight and get
much more reality of what one has just bought for his beloved one than just to
sit and wait for landing and internet reconnection.

And every
time one is online the app switches into online mode, downloads news, new
models etc.

One can create his own profile either online on
web (in e-shop) or in the app where he can store information what models he
already owns and models he wishes to have – he just puts them into wish list.
And it really wouldn’t matter if you’ve just marked ownership of new model in
the app or via web as it will synchronize with each other.Why name ThetaGifts?Maybe
one of your questions is why the name ThetaGifts?!? 
Theta is originally the eighth
symbol of Greek alphabet and it represents several meanings. Egyptians used it
to denote soul, spirit, thought or life. And that’s what our models should
do. They should bring about or support better relationships with your beloved ones or your friends or business partners. They should
represent you in the soul of the person
whom you’ve presented one of our models. Every time he or she sees it they remember
you, think of you.

  Risks & Challenges 

The project
is basically very easy and with our experiences in business and customer’s
attitude we are quite sure we’ll keep everything what is written here.
There is a
risk of delay caused by our intention to get really high quality product and so
we have to put lot of stress in product detailed designing that way factory
will be able to produce it in such quality.
We do not
expect any big challenges regarding goods registration or customs. 
There is challenge to keep the price hopefully everywhere at approximately same level. It depends very much on local taxes and conditions of particular airport.


FAQ

1.  What material will be the models
made from?
Metal alloy composed of zinc, aluminium and copper. This is standard
alloy used for manufacturing of metal models. Special and limited editions could be made also from other materials.
2.  What’s the business strategy?
As it is stated above in project description – the main business
strategy will be built on sale via vending machines, e-shop and retailers (toy
shops, gas stations, present shops, souvenir shops etc.) There will be two main distribution
points – one in the USA and one in the European Union. The rest of the world will be
covered from those two points at the beginning. Later there will
be very likely more distribution points.
3.  What will be the price of models?
All the standard models will have the same price. The plan is to keep as
low price as possible – according to the data what we’ve gathered it should be around $
13-15. There is lot of factors influencing the price – local taxes, rent at
airport, brand fees, maintenance, employees etc., but it all should be fine
within the price stated above. In case of any radical local conditions in some
single cases the price can be different.
4.  At what airports you’d like to
start?
We’d like to start at some of the busiest airports in the world, but it
also depends on logistics and some other factors. There anyway will be kind of
pilot run at some airport (probably Vienna airport which has traffic more than
20 million of  passengers annually. In
USA it should be Tampa, Florida (traffic of about 16 million of passengers
annually). Right after pilot run we’ll jump on big airports - namely London
Heathrow (almost 65 mil. passengers per year); Frankfurt, Germany (49
millions); Atlanta, USA (no. 1 in the world with it’s 80 million passengers per
year); JFK New York (53 millions); Chicago (70 millions) etc.
5.  What models will you start with?

We’d like to release 10 types of models in first
wave. There we definitely would like to cover well known planes like Boeing 747, Airbus A380 and some army planes like F16 or SU-27 Flanker as well as other significant aircrafts. We welcome any proposals to fit your desires.6.  Will you directly cooperate with vehicle producers?Yes, in every case where it will be possible including any license rights and fees and information right from source.Our team

<br/><br/><h1>Sizes and Materials</h1>
<p>All clothes will be made out of 
fabrics from Turkey that are certified with the Global Organic Textile 
Standard (GOTS). By using only organic cotton we can produce garments 
that won't harm the planet or 
your child's skin.</p>
<p>The prototypes below reflect the general styles
 we will offer, with cheerful colors and cuts that are genuine 
children's clothes, rather than miniature adult clothes. Please note 
that some of the prints featured in the prototypes will not be initially
 available. To see official palette for the first round of production, 
go to our Indiegogo Archive (on the top of the page, just below the 
headline).</p>
<p>Every garment will be customizable: you will get to 
select color or print, as well as other details. See FAQ below for more 
info on how this works.</p>
<p>Our webshop will carry seven clothing 
categories: shirts, dresses, trousers, baby bodies, pyjamas, dungarees, 
baby grows, and finally, one sweet hat.</p>
<p>Sizes:</p>
<p>We offer baby sizes: <br/>50/56 (age 0-2 months, UK 1)<br/>62/68 (age 3-6 months, UK 2)<br/>74/80 (age 6-12 months, UK 3)<br/>86/92 (age 12-24 months, UK 4-5)</p>

<p>We believe that with time,
big business will follow our example, and the examples of other small businesses with similar values, so that this way of doing business will
be the norm—not the exception. The fashion industry needs to be pushed.<br/></p>
<p> Hopefully, the industry's predatory practices like <i>sweat shops</i>, <i>wage dumping</i> and <i>“out of sight”-production</i> will soon be shameful memories of the past. We believe
that Pitupi could be a proverbial mouse that scares the herd of elephants into
moving, slowly but surely, towards a higher standard.</p>

<h2><a name=""socialimpact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Social Impact</a></h2>
<p>Although all three co-founders have backgrounds in various NGO's, 
including the UN, Pitupi is not about charity. Rather, it's about 
creating a <i>sustainable business model that shares benefits equally</i>. 
</p>
<p>Our factory is based in Blinisht, Albania, which is a village in the 
north, near the city of Lezhë. The concept of ""social business"" has not 
yet found it's way to Albania, and many garment factories operate at a 
""produce at any cost""-philosophy; something which doesn't offer the 
community a fair compensation, considered the work that they put in.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate for working-age women in Albania is around 50%,
 and even higher for women who lack a formal education. For this reason,
 Pitupi will only hire women to work as our seamstresses. Furthermore, 
the minimum wage in Albania is 22,000 Lek (appr. 155 euros), but our 
seamstresses net income will be double that amount. This will empower 
them personally as well as support their entire community; beyond that, 
as a special perk to the employees we will also set up a fund to be 
invested in their children's education.</p>

</h2>
<h4>How does
the customization work?</h4>
<p>You’ll go
to our online shop where you’ll see our selection of standard children’s clothing styles. After deciding which garment you want, you will get to select a print, a stripe, or an all-over color, before finally choosing any add-on details. These details might include a contrasting border color on the neck and wrists, or the addition of pockets.<span> Your customized order
will then be sent to our factory, where one of our seamstresses will set to work on it.</span></p>
<p></p>
<h4>What sizes do you offer?<br/>
</h4>
<span>We offer baby sizes: <br/>50/56 (age 0-2 months, UK 1)<br/>62/68 (age 3-6 months, UK 2)<br/>74/80 (age 6-12 months, UK 3)<br/>86/92 (age 12-24 months, UK 4-5)<br/></span><p><span>and children's sizes:<br/>98 (age 2-3 years, UK 5-6)<br/>104/110 (age 3-5 years, UK 6-7)<br/>116/122 (age 5-6 years, UK 8-9).<br/></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>Hat sizes include:<br/></p>
<p>36; 38; 40; 42; 44; 46; 48; 50.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>How long does it take to receive an order?</h4>
<p>Since every garment is custom made, Pitupi might naturally need a bit longer for shipping and production than what people might be used to in a consumer culture almost obsessed with speed. We hope to have a turn around time that can 
satisfy both the customer and our hard working seamstresses.<i> We aim to have items ready and shipped within a 21 day window. </i></p>
<h4>How does
the transparency work?</h4>
<p>First off,
you’ll know exactly who made your product. By visiting our website's Faces page, you can check each seamstress' unique profile, hear about her background and future hopes, and see her photo. We might even be able to
arrange for you to contact your seamstress directly, but language differences might presents a few challenges. Additionally, we plan to keep the
factory doors open for scheduled visits. <br/></p>
<p>We will also keep customers posted on who we buy our materials from, what certifications our fabrics carry, and how they were transported to our factory. We want you to be able to follow us through every step of the journey.<br/></p>
<p>Last, but not least, cost breakdowns for
each product will be made visible, where exactly how much of the price goes to materials, salaries,
overhear costs and so on, will be on the website in plain sight.</p>
<h4>What is your price range<br/>
</h4>Our items range from 19 euro to 39 euro, or 190kr to 390kr (SEK) retail.<br/><br/><h4>What's your sales plan?</h4>The first focus will be on the Swedish and German markets, because of our physical presence here, and also because of [the segments]. Our marketing strategy focuses on channels like social media, where we already have experience.<br/><br/>It is our hope that Pitupi will be able to expand beyond these two countries, into the EU, and eventually into larger markets like the United States.<br/><br/><h4>What about the design?</h4>
<p>Our current
collection is designed by Anne Freitag, a German textile designer with an educational background in fashion design. Rather than regularly changing
spring-fall collections—which we feel encourages over-consumption—we will work with Anne to
make changes and updates as we go along; keeping the most well liked items
while leaving less loved prints behind.</p>
<h4>What certifications will the clothes carry?</h4>
<p>Our most immediate certification goal is to become GOTS-certified. GOTS stands for <a href=""http://www.global-standard.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Global Organic Textile Standard</a> and certifies garments are made ethically, from organic materials, and in fair conditions. We cannot yet print the GOTS label on our clothing because we first need to have the factory reviewed and numerous criteria has to be met, but we look forward to pursuing this certification in due time.</p>

Pitupi: a social business
The idea behind Pitupi is that a business transaction should be for the shared benefit of everyone involved--from the cotton farmer, to the tailor, to the buyer. We have a model where everyone gains and nobody's taken advantage of, and we've decided to create an alternative for the conscious consumer and the proactive parent, who care not only about their own needs but also about how their choices affect the lives of others–one garment at a time.From left to right: our Tulip dress; our longsleeve t-shirt paired with our reversible kids bloomers.








The Product
We offer 7 distinct clothing categories. Each style below is available for purchase through the perks featured at the right of this webpage. 

Pitupi Dresses from left to right: Petite, Longsleeve, & Tulip 

From left to right: traditional neck baby body; round neck body; & Reversible hat
Pyjamas: two piece childrens (blue) and one piece baby (red)
Pants, from left to right: Baby bloomers; Straight-leg pants; Child bloomers with cuff. All reversible--pockets can be added at your choosing.
Pitupi Longsleeve Tees. Can be made with two snap fasteners at the shoulder for babies.From left to right: Children's dungarees with pockets; Pitupi baby grow

Sizes and Materials
All clothes will be made out of 
fabrics from Turkey that are certified with the Global Organic Textile 
Standard (GOTS). By using only organic cotton we can produce garments 
that won't harm the planet or 
your child's skin.
The prototypes below reflect the general styles
 we will offer, with cheerful colors and cuts that are genuine 
children's clothes, rather than miniature adult clothes. Please note 
that some of the prints featured in the prototypes will not be initially
 available. To see official palette for the first round of production, 
go to our Indiegogo Archive (on the top of the page, just below the 
headline).
Every garment will be customizable: you will get to 
select color or print, as well as other details. See FAQ below for more 
info on how this works.
Our webshop will carry seven clothing 
categories: shirts, dresses, trousers, baby bodies, pyjamas, dungarees, 
baby grows, and finally, one sweet hat.
Sizes:
We offer baby sizes: 50/56 (age 0-2 months, UK 1)62/68 (age 3-6 months, UK 2)74/80 (age 6-12 months, UK 3)86/92 (age 12-24 months, UK 4-5)
and children's sizes:98 (age 2-3 years, UK 5-6)104/110 (age 3-5 years, UK 6-7)116/122 (age 5-6 years, UK 8-9).
Hat sizes include:
36; 38; 40; 42; 44; 46; 48; 50.


The Longsleeve-T and our baby bloomers
Step-by-step guide: How to order

Leading by example in kidswear
Our kids clothing company is committed to transparency, sustainability, and quality. We want to make a product people will love because of how it looks AND because of how it was made. 



Dungarees; Petite dress & Straight pants
Baby body & Dungaree
We believe that with time,
big business will follow our example, and the examples of other small businesses with similar values, so that this way of doing business will
be the norm—not the exception. The fashion industry needs to be pushed.
 Hopefully, the industry's predatory practices like sweat shops, wage dumping and “out of sight”-production will soon be shameful memories of the past. We believe
that Pitupi could be a proverbial mouse that scares the herd of elephants into
moving, slowly but surely, towards a higher standard.



Social Impact
Although all three co-founders have backgrounds in various NGO's, 
including the UN, Pitupi is not about charity. Rather, it's about 
creating a sustainable business model that shares benefits equally. 

Our factory is based in Blinisht, Albania, which is a village in the 
north, near the city of Lezhë. The concept of ""social business"" has not 
yet found it's way to Albania, and many garment factories operate at a 
""produce at any cost""-philosophy; something which doesn't offer the 
community a fair compensation, considered the work that they put in.
The unemployment rate for working-age women in Albania is around 50%,
 and even higher for women who lack a formal education. For this reason,
 Pitupi will only hire women to work as our seamstresses. Furthermore, 
the minimum wage in Albania is 22,000 Lek (appr. 155 euros), but our 
seamstresses net income will be double that amount. This will empower 
them personally as well as support their entire community; beyond that, 
as a special perk to the employees we will also set up a fund to be 
invested in their children's education.
Drop us a line or head to our website for more info about this very important subject.
