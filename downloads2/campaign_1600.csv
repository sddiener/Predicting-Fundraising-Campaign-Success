Mi meta y mi sueño ha sido lograr estudiar en una escuela de circo profesional pero en mi país no hay una escuela profesional de circo, así que tome energía y decidí audicionar para una de las mejores escuelas de circo del mundo, la Academia Municipal de Circo y Artes Variadas de Kyie en Ucrania y logre entrar.</p>

<p>Art is connection. Art tells stories. Art is for everyone. goARTful’s founders, Messay Derebe, Brandolon Barnett, Nacho Cerrato, and Meghan Ball, all believe strongly that the arts can be transformative. We believe that art is not just “pretty pictures” on a wall but something that can have a profound impact on peoples lives. Art can affect how comfortable, productive, and happy we are in the spaces we inhabit.</p>

<p>Your backing will allow us to expand our business, support more artists, and give people the opportunity to share their story with art.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>goARTful envisions a world where everyone has access to art and where artists can make a living from their work.  Your contributions will enable us to make goARTful’s second year a success. We believe deeply in this vision, which is why our founding team has been bootstrapping goARTful for a year, while working 9-5's, to make our dream a reality. Your contributions will support the growth we need to reach our vision.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $20,000 that will enable us to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Polish our site and build out our app to create more features for customers to experience art, artists to grow their revenue, and art galleries to improve access to art;</li>
<li>Expand our operations through expanded sales to businesses and building our brand for consumers and businesses in the top 5 US markets;</li>
<li>Enhance our business operations/product to efficiently deliver and manage exchanges/orders;</li>
<li>Build our events offering and enhance the arts community starting in the DC area and then around the country;</li>
<li>Ramp up our artist recruitment to triple our active artists by the end of the year;</li>
<li>Invest in a more robust marketing and communications dashboard for our artists.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>*All of these funds will be invested directly into the business. None of the funds will go to salaries for our founding team!*</i></p>
<p>While $20,000 will help us achieve all our goals, any amount of our goal will go a long way in democratizing art.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Art is about powerful experiences, not just financial transactions. Our individual members and corporate customers don’t just get beautiful art to purchase, rent, and explore on their walls. They also get perks like access to a community and cool events that can help them to create more meaningful connections to artists.</p></li>
<li><p>Our artists are just as important as our members. In fact, we’re part artist-owned! They’ll grow as we grow. Plus, our platform helps them build their businesses through analytics and reaching new customers!</p></li>
<li><p>Technology can break down barriers and make it easier and more convenient to try out new art. You might love a piece when you see it at a festival or on a site. But what will it look like in your home? Our augmented reality app can show you! We want to build more  of these breakthrough technologies whether it's VR as a tool for interior design, better methods for easy hanging and shipping of art prints, or even better scanning of prints to enable artists to get more high quality prints of their work for sale.</p></li>
<li><p>We’re a social enterprise, with a goARTful corporate charitable advised fund. At a minimum, 3% of our membership revenue will go to support local artists and arts nonprofits in the cities in which we operate.</p></li>
<li><p>Our slogan with artists is “You do the art, we do the business!” We do the marketing, we do the customer relationship management, we handle the logistics at a fraction of the cost of traditional galleries and arts markets.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know that we’re not the first “rotating art” or “Rent the Runway for Art” platform. However, we are confident that we are the first of our kind to tackle a fundamental problem: that it’s expensive, scary, and hard for  ordinary people to enjoy local, original art. Yet that desire to ""buy local"" is just as important for art as it is for food and in other areas of our life. We’re different from what came before in a few really important ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>We’re all about quality and curation. Don’t need to scroll through a hundred pages to find one piece of art you like, only to discover you don’t know who made it.  </li>
<li>We’re approachable. No elitist attitudes about what constitutes art here. We want you to try new art, especially if you don’t know what you like yet.</li>
<li>We create a community, directly supporting artists and a thriving arts community wherever is local to you.</li>
</ol>

<p><u><strong>General objective : </strong></u></p>
<p>The project aims to empower Palestinian children and youth in East Jerusalem to claim and enjoy their cultural rights as a means to encourage creativity and innovation and promote a culture of freedom, diversity and steadfastness among marginalized children and youth, especially young girls, and to flourish the creative diversity that can sustain public life in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong><u>Background of beneficiary region: </u></strong></p>
<p>In addition to its religious importance, Jerusalem has played a historic role in Palestinian political, economic, social and cultural life, especially after the expropriation of the Palestinian urban centers in coastal cities and West Jerusalem in the Nakba in 1948. Over the years, Jerusalem, as a lively city, has been affected by the multifaceted system of occupation imposed by Israel which has adversely altered its urban, demographic, economic, social and cultural features and its predominantly Palestinian Arab landscape. The Israeli polices of physical, political and economic segregation of the City from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory, has left the once vibrant urban and cultural centre completely isolated and cut off from its natural hinterland with its population living in marginalized conditions. These polices include the city’s annexation, expansion of Jewish settlements in and around East Jerusalem, construction of the separation wall, a complex system of checkpoints and closures as well as restrictive administrative policies and practices that influence every aspect of ordinary Palestinian life in Jerusalem that mainly aim to reduce the population of Palestinians in Jerusalem. This multifaceted system of occupation severely compromises individual and communal capacities to engage in economic and social life, to access health, education and commercial services and has demeaned the capacity of the City at large to naturally develop and progress. This separation of Jerusalem from the West Bank and Gaza, has severely affected the cultural life of the city. People cannot come from the West Bank to participate in cultural events, and Jerusalemites have to cross major checkpoints to join events in the West Bank. Jerusalem’s historic role as the centre of culture and art for the Palestinian society has inevitably been affected by the policies of closure and restrictions on movement of Palestinians, despite all efforts of institutions and individuals attempts to maintain and develop the cultural life of the city.</p>
<p><u><strong>Project description : </strong></u></p>
<p>The Jerusalemite Youth Cultural Forum aims from this project to form an art school in Silwan to provide appropriate and equal opportunities for children and youths, who are interested in learning different kinds of art professionally, in that area in particular and Jerusalem in general. The project also aims to raise awareness and broaden the knowledge of individuals in the field of art and it’s aspects.</p>
<p>As well, the promotion of productions, work of art and spreading it’s message to the majority of locals will contribute to the preservation of the Palestinian culture heritage and also contribute in strengthening relations between the forum and various functioning youth community centers in Jerusalem that work in the same field, because part of the activities will be implemented in corporation with different art organizations in Jerusalem, In addition to organizing many public live art shows to the masses.</p>
<p>The project also aims to meet between the local needs of art and focus on the positive role of arts in the life of communities due to its importance in order to improve their talents and strengthen their interaction in this field which will contribute to the development of their art capabilities and expand the horizons of creativity and art perception to give them a path of hope to change their difficult life situations because of the continuous Israeli occupation practices.</p>
<p> The Forum as well hopes to succeed in reaching various parts of the society to provide them with equal opportunities to learn art and improve their talents despite their economic situation or place of residence. The participants will be taught music weekly all year long. About 100 kids will benefit from this project between the ages of 7 and 20 boys and girls. The project will also form 3 choirs (20 to 30 students each), teach the skills of the Palestinian Folkloric dance “Dabka” for about 80 students through the year, teach Drama in order to execute plays and educational shows for about 1500 students at different schools following the Palestinian Ministry of Education in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The aim in general is to attract students` attention to the importance of art and its different fields (music, Drama, Dabka, painting,…etc.) There will be about 25 public shows in Silwan and Jerusalem. The project will also hold a summer camp for 60 students to encourage them to continue studying art in its different fields and provide them with a chance to exchange experiences to realize the importance of art in our lives as a mean of education. The project also aims to shed a light on the importance of art in our Palestinian condition to ensure our cultural identity.</p>
<p><strong><u>Project Objectives:</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Setting an art school in Silwan and enable it administratively, financially and organizationally to carry out its activities and maintain its continuity.</li>
<li>Raising and disseminating artistic cultural awareness among the sons of Silwan in particular and Jerusalem in general, despite all the difficult living conditions that they experience as a result of the daily practices of the occupation.</li>
<li>Provide equal and appropriate opportunity for children and young people who wish to learn art to do so, regardless of their economic status or place of residence.</li>
<li>Providing safe and suitable places for children and youth in Silwan to develop their talents and skills, which will reflect positively on their personalities and give them a space of hope for a better future.</li>
<li>Emphasize the Arab cultural identity and strengthen the steadfastness of the people of Silwan in particular and the city of Jerusalem in general and preserve the cultural heritage through generations of youth.</li>
<li>Contribute to the promotion of artistic education in Palestinian schools working in Jerusalem through disseminating arts to the largest possible number of students and informing them about the importance of art in building healthy and strong societies.</li>
<li>Strengthening and building cooperation and partnership relations between the Forum and the community institutions and other art centers operating in Silwan and many different areas in Jerusalem.</li>
<li>activating the artistic life in Silwan in particular and in Jerusalem in general and trying to break the siege imposed on the holy city and strengthen the Palestinian communication with different musical cultures.</li>
<li>Spread the messages of love, peace and joy in most areas of Jerusalem within the concept of the resistance society.</li>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Since we formed our camp in 2016 its popularity has exploded. While this is great and very gratifying, it has become much more costly to run.  Far more than all the members dues can cover.  Some of the things that have made our camp so popular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pewter Casting Events - Make your own pewter pendants.</li>
<li>Frito Pie Pig Out - 500 of these in 2017.</li>
<li>Sunglasses Monkey Hut - Gifting hundreds of sunglasses.</li>
<li>Hippity Hop Races</li>
<li>Full Service Bar - Day and Night</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>To bring it all back to the Playa at the level it has grown to, we find ourselves needing to raise funds.</p>
<h3>How It's Used</h3>
<p>Aside from the obvious cost of the pewter, food, and alcohol we serve, it runs over 50.00 per day just to stock the bar with ice, not to mention the mixers and soft drinks we dispense both during events and during regular bar hours.  </p>
<p>All funds gathered by our camp go directly towards serving the community. We have no communal camp stuff such as meals, so every cent raised in dues and this fund raiser goes directly towards products and materials for events on the Playa. All funds raised from this campaign will go solely towards things like pewter for our pewter casting events, food products for our Frito Pie Event, stocking the bar with alcohol, ice, mixers, and non alcoholic beverages as well. </p>
<p>We don't just want to be standing here with our hands out begging and have come up with some great perks to thank those who donate.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donations will help us keep the pewter casting events large, serve 500 or more Frito Pies, and keep the bar full service and open about 20 hours a day, serving a full selection of beverages both with and without alcohol to our Playa neighborhood.</p>
<p>Join with us to make Hookers &amp; Makers Camp an even bigger success in its third year on the Playa.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>2016</p>
<p> As an outgrowth of friendships and our regional camp we formed our original Burning Man camp - Hungry Hungry Hookers (based on crocheting which uses hooks in case you are wondering). We hit the Playa with non WWW events in Pewter Casting, Frito Pies, Sunglasses Monkey Hut, and a bar that operated 4 to 6 hours a day.  This was a fairly small operation that was funded mostly by our founder.</p>
<p>2017</p>
<p>Membership increased and it was decided to change the name to reflect that we make other stuff besides crochet resulting in Hookers &amp; Makers camp. Due to the popularity of the events and bar in 2016, we decided to up our game and add events to the WWW as well as to increase bar hours to 8 hours a day. Member dues were instituted to help cover the increased cost and the plan seemed solid. As usually happens with the best of plans, things went unexpectedly starting on opening day of the burn.  The bar became a neighborhood hot spot and was hopping 20 hours a day. Scheduled  WWW events drew enormous crowds. Everyone wanted to make a pewter pendant! Everyone wanted Frito Pie! Everyone was very thirsty, and at night we had the only open bar in the area. By Tuesday we were struggling to keep the bar stocked.  Through no plan of our own, the Playa had decided we needed to bring it bigger.</p>
<p>2018</p>
<p>We plan to bring it bigger and better than ever. We'll see you in the dust.</p>

<h3>El artista</h3>
<p>Arquitecto de formación (ETSAM) y con un Doctorado en Bellas Artes (UCM), Manuel Oyonarte lleva desde mediados de la década de 1980 entregado a su auténtica pasión, la pintura.</p>
<p>En solitario o acompañado de otros compañeros de profesión (ha fundado diversos grupos artísticos), Manuel Oyonarte ha participado en numerosas exposiciones en diferentes galerías y museos nacionales e internacionales. Además, es académico en Academias de reconocido prestigio, como en la Academia Internacional ""Greci-Marino"" di Vercelli o en la Academia Internazionale Gentilicia ""Il Marzocco"" di Firenze.</p>
<p>Su faceta investigadora le convierte en un artista nada usual, siempre preocupado por el pensamiento y la filosofía que hay en sus obras. Así, su proceso creativo, plasmado en sus cuadros, está ocultamente articulado en torno a nociones estéticas de corte vitalista y existencialista. Sus inquietudes le han llevado también a experimentar con numerosos estilos y materiales, generando curiosas y fascinantes combinaciones en el espacio abstracto.</p>
<h3>El proyecto</h3>
<p>En este documental, Manuel Oyonarte nos abre las puertas de su taller y nos habla de todo el recorrido que transita hasta colgar el cuadro en la galería: desde los motivos que inspiran sus cuadros hasta los últimos retoques, pasando por la exposición de su método creativo, original y muy personal.</p>
<h3>La situación</h3>
<p>La pandemia nos ha hecho darnos cuenta de la importancia de la cultura en nuestro día a día. Para poder disfrutar de una cultura segura se han puesto en marcha numerosas iniciativas, como por ejemplo los museos virtuales.</p>
<p>No obstante, no experimentamos lo mismo ante un cuadro si simplemente lo vemos que si su autor nos puede explicar qué hay detrás de cada pincelada. El documental de Manuel Oyonarte es una gran oportunidad para potenciar la experiencia estética al contemplar los cuadros de uno de los artistas más interesantes del panorama actual.</p>
<p>Con tu apoyo, además, demostramos el carácter indispensable de la cultura y la posibilidad de un disfrute seguro y cómodo de la misma.</p>
<h3>La financiación</h3>
<p>Hasta ahora, hemos conseguido completar la Fase 1 de esta pieza, que incluye la preproducción y el rodaje. En esta fase, gracias a la participación y ayuda de personas interesadas en el proyecto y un empuje de inversión propia, hemos conseguido completar todas las jornadas de grabación y alcanzar un montaje definitivo.</p>
<p>Actualmente, nos encontramos en la Fase 2: la postproducción. Ésta incluye tanto el etalonaje o la corrección de color, como la edición de sonido o la composición de una banda sonora original.</p>
<p>Es aquí donde entrarías tú que, con tu colaboración, nos ayudarías a conseguir la financiación necesaria para cumplir este último objetivo. Gracias a este último empujón podríamos dar las últimas pinceladas a este proyecto que se ha realizado con muchísimo cariño y dedicación, y comenzar su distribución por distintos festivales nacionales e internacionales. La proyección de este corto documental está planteada para llegar a festivales debido al gran interés que consideramos generaría entre su público y jurado. Algunos de los festivales a los que nos gustaría poder enviarlo serían los siguientes:</p>
<p>NACIONALES: </p>

<h3>Cómo ayudar</h3>
<p>El objetivo de este crowdfunding es conseguir la cifra de 3.500€ para terminar la postproducción e invertir en su distribución. Para colaborar en este proyecto hay varias maneras de hacerlo.</p>
<p>La primera de ellas sería reclamando alguna de las recompensas que podrás encontrar en esta misma página, por las que puedes recibir desde una camiseta con estampación de un dibujo de Manuel Oyonarte en impresión directa, a una litografía original numerada y firmada a mano, o incluso el propio cuadro creado durante y para esta pieza documental, además de, por supuesto, una mención en los créditos como agradecimiento especial.</p>
<p>La segunda, sería haciendo una contribución menor a las recompensas (¡toda ayuda es bien recibida!), que también se realizaría en esta misma página, en cuyo caso no recibirías un regalo pero siempre aparecerías en agradecimientos en los créditos.</p>
<p>Por último, si te es imposible hacer una aportación monetaria, no significa que no puedas colaborar, ya siempre puedes ayudarnos compartiendo este crowdfunding en tus redes sociales y con tus familiares y amigos más queridos.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This project is a collaboration between <strong>Saumitra Chandratreya</strong> (<a href=""https://www.saumitrac.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.saumitrac.com/</a>) an award winning abstract artist working primarily with fabric and <strong>Kevin Mooney </strong>(<a href=""https://www.leprechauninc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.leprechauninc.com/</a>) respected author and published poet. Our campaign aims to raise the resources necessary to manifest the creation (Act I), marketing (Act II) and installation (Act III) of our artistic concept. <strong><i>The Secret Language of Intimacy</i></strong>  invites viewers to engage in various ways of communicating honestly the valid emotions created by differing levels of intimacy. In this case, intimacy is communicated by transcribing emotions utilizing two disparate art forms: the language of poetry and abstract art on fabric panels. Your contribution will play the part of the magician by giving us the resources to make a creative dream a reality! Be a part of creating an installation that is destined to be seen by millions of people worldwide.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Because of the interactive and theatrical nature of our installation the budget we have created is organized into three sections: <strong>Act I</strong>, <strong>Act II</strong>, and <strong>Act III</strong>. The <strong>total budget is $15,000</strong> which includes manufacturing, marketing, installation, fees, taxes, plus 20% for unseen expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Act I:</strong>   The construction and labor to actually build the physical installation. This includes but is not limited to: fabric, printing, hardware, and labor. Approximate cost: $10,000</p>
<p><strong>Act II</strong>:  The marketing materials and services to ensure galleries, museums and other venues understand why they will want to exhibit <strong>The Secret Language of Intimacy</strong>. This includes but is not limited to: photography, video, brochures, flyers, shipping, advertising, and promotional products. Approximate cost: $3000</p>
<p><strong>Act III</strong>:  The physical installation into the first few venues. This includes but is not limited to: site inspection, transportation, and labor. Approximate cost: $2000</p>
<p>With every donation you will receive a piece of the installation as a physical manifestation of the energy you contributed in order to create an amazing artistic installation! Check out the list of PERKS and choose which fits your best intention. If you wish to donate any amount of funds without receiving a gift you can click on the red BACKER button at the top of the page next to the FOLLOW button.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Artists are people who have always taken the road less traveled and in doing so need to use their gifts to create out-of-the-box vehicles for seed money and income. Every project, whether it be a start-up business, a new product development, or a theatrical production on Broadway needs seed money to prime the economic engine it is intended to create. </p>
<p><strong>The Secret Language of Intimacy</strong> is not only an artistic installation meant to feed the soul but also an economic engine that will sustain itself in order to touch millions of hearts around the world. Intimacy is about relationships and the world needs more honest and non-judgmental communication of our emotional perspective.</p>
<p>With your contributions, our award winning artistic gifts, and our proven project management skills we can make this a reality, together!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In every entrepreneurial endeavor there are risks and challenges, and <strong>The Secret language of Intimacy</strong> is no exception. The big risk is that no one will care or like what we are presenting but because of our successful artistic track record we believe our product (The Secret Language of Intimacy) has what the buyer is looking for: a creative window into their own soul. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge is to promote and inform a wide variety of venues so they will know the product is available and will see the value in bringing the installation to their audience. We have already overcome this first hurdle with the honored opportunity by Gallery 221 at Hillsborough Community College (HCC) in Tampa to exhibit <strong>The Secret Language of Intimacy</strong> for a nine week engagement: July 20 - September 24, 2020!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are numerous ways to contribute with or without cash donations. In this age of social media and people to people connections everyone is a potential donor in one way or another. You can share this site with your friends and colleagues and join the mailing list on our websites to get all the latest information on the progress and notification of the dates of every installation.</p>
<p>Saying ""Thank You"" does not nearly express our appreciation and gratitude for all your help.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So What does this money go towards besides campaigning pro or anti mullet?</p>
<ul>
<li>Right now we are in a search for our forever home.  We have several historical estates on the east coast we are considering, and this is the first in a series of fundraisers for our capital campaign.  All together we need to raise approximately 1,500,000 for the purchase, immediate renovations and operating expenses.  </li>
<li>We are going to cap the mullet campaign at 45 days.  At the end, regardless of the amount raised, whoever has more ""votes"" will be declared winner, and rewarded accordingly.  </li>
<li>All monies earned will go into the Elysian Account along with contributions from our Patreon Supporters.  This money only goes towards Elysian Programs and the ultimate goal of building our dream home.  Everything else has been personally financed by the members of our board, separate from raised Elysian Funds. </li>
<li>Joining our Patreon allows you access to a monthly update of exactly how we spend any Elysian Funds.</li>
<li>While we have set our goal at 100k for this particular fundraiser, our efforts are on going.  The money, regardless of how much is raised will go towards the funding our property purchase, the more generosity we have, the more exciting the mullet battle, and the more quickly we can procure our Sanctuary.  </li>

<p><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been a professional artist--truly living the life of an artist, not squeezing it in--for over nine years and have loved every moment of this journey.  (Before this I taught at university, was academic director at a school in India, taught in Krakow, Poland, and then became a coach, teaching Law of Attraction and other courses I developed.)  But as I like to say, I coached myself into a full-time art career!) The two best things about this is that I get to paint almost every day AND I get to meet and paint for amaaazing people!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT I WANT TO DO</strong></p>
<p>I've had an interest in learning and teaching more of the Old Masters drawing and painting techniques for some time now and when I stumbled upon this program, it felt perfect for me.  It's from 9AM-4 PM, five days a week from July 8th-August 3rd! Total immersion!  Even though I'm a contemporary artist, I believe learning these classical techniques more deeply will inspire my contemporary work and also allow me to create more exciting portraits.  And this is important since I do a lot of commissioned portraits... I hope to be painting for many of you! </p>
<p>Another big plus for me is that I know being away is always when new things bubble up and my art can take on exciting new directions or turns—as it did in 2012 when I began palette knife painting while I was at a painting retreat at the Atlantic Center for the Arts.  I know being able to explore NYC for a month will crystalize my vision for a new series of NYC paintings that I've been contemplating for some time.  (My working title is: <i>Five Boroughs, The Iconic and The Everyday, </i>but I will see how this emerges... As an artist, I always have to leave space for a new project to find its own way through me!)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>MY GOAL</strong></p>
<p>I 'm trying to raise a total of $5510.  This will allow me to cover my $2650 tuition and $1900 lodging, and some of the fees I will pay to Indiegogo and to my gallery, The Hub on Canal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>REWARDS: What you get!</strong></p>
<p>First, please reach out to me if there is something you want, a specific type of painting, that you don't see... pamela@pamelarameytatum.com  </p>
<p>You can see all the details of the rewards on the side panel of this page by scrolling down.  Here are a few things:<br/>*  Every single person who supports me in this project will receive a hand-written, heartfelt thank you on one of my art cards.  </p>
<p>* Plus you will have access to my donor exclusive weekly e-newsletter where I'll be sending images and updates during my month in NJ &amp; NYC!</p>
<p>I'm offering my existing work—cards, prints, and originals--as well as new work I'll create while I'm away, as well as new work I'll create upon my return AND most special of all to my heart: commissions!  All of these are at discounted prices—less than at my website and less than at my studio.   PLUS, I'm giving some other fun incentives--or goodies as I like to call them--to all of my supporters. (Just click on the perk and you can see what all is offered.)</p>
<p>In the event that I do not reach my full goal, I will use the money for this program and have to finance the rest.. ugh!  Either way my art will pay for my art :)  I’d much rather not pay interest and give YOU the rewards.  It’s so much fun to have others be a part of an exciting project and my artistic journey!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Not only will this allow me to take my art to the next level, but it will also allow me to bring the Old Masters' techniques back to teach students, both adults and teens, in my community.  And it will allow my new NYC series of oil paintings to be born!  The other important aspect of this is that there are unforeseen gifts and unimagined directions my life could take as a result of this immersive experience, the people I will meet, and my new work inspired by this program.  I am always open to… what else… what wonderful things always seem to result when we follow our heart!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>RISK AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>The only risk I can really think of is that I haven’t imagined how many people will donate and I will get hand cramps from writing all the thank you notes!  Seriously, I feel very confident, that unless there is a natural disaster, I will be meeting my goals for this project and delivering my rewards on time.   Of course in the event of any eventuality--illness or whatnot-- I will keep my backers posted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>Every bit helps! Even if you can't contribute at the moment, you can still help by sharing my new project with your friends and family.  Just use the Indiegogo share tool.  At the top of the page on the right, you'll see FB, etc. icons.  You could also copy the link to this page and email it.  Thank you so much!</p>

<h3>Welcome!  </h3>
<p>The Caregiver Journey project provides prints of my painting, ""The Caregiver Journey"" , to raise funds for caregiver education.  </p>
<p>Rosalyn Carter said, ""There are only four kinds of people in the world.  Those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers and those who will need a caregiver."" </p>
<p>The statistics are shocking and only getting worse.  Eighty percent of adults requiring long-term care currently live at home in the community, and unpaid family caregivers, primarily women,  provide 90% of their care.  Family caregivers find it necessary to leave their jobs to care for family members, or must juggle both the caregiver role while providing care.  The role is both physically and emotionally draining.   Most caregivers face an escalating challenge that they are not prepared for and have no training for.   </p>
<p>Knowing  how to care for a loved one with dementia is not something we learn in school or through life experience.  It's a crash course with tests we are totally unprepared for.  The Dealing with Dementia workshop gives caregivers proven strategies for dealing with a number of issues.</p>
<p>This project is starting in Maryville, Tennessee, USA but my hope is to expand it's reach across the United States and beyond.</p>

<p>During one Caregiver Cafe gathering I asked the caregivers attending to share words, colors and images that represent their caregiver journey.  My goal was to find a way to creatively express that conversation and hopefully provide them with a painting to celebrate and honor them.  The result is my painting, ""The Caregiver Journey.""  In this one work you will find quotes, words (both positive and negative), images such as storm clouds, sunflowers, a purple Alzheimer's ribbon, a singing bird, a drive in the mountains and much more.  All are  things that the caregivers requested to be included.  The painting is perfectly imperfect... just like every caregivers journey.  Not everything is as it seems,   What should be isn't and what shouldn't be.. well it is anyway! </p>
<h3>What your donation will do</h3>
<p>Donations will fund ""Dealing with Dementia"" workshops.  The Dealing with Dementia workshop  is a five hour program that gives caregivers proven strategies for dealing with a number of issues.  The cost to provide the materials and lunch for each attendee is $35.  Many caregivers can not afford the cost of the workshop and I am continuously trying to find funding.  My goal is to raise funds so those who want to attend can do so.   My hope is to do that with this campaign. </p>

The Caregiver Journey project provides prints of my painting, ""The Caregiver Journey"" , to raise funds for caregiver education.  
Rosalyn Carter said, ""There are only four kinds of people in the world.  Those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers and those who will need a caregiver."" 
The statistics are shocking and only getting worse.  Eighty percent of adults requiring long-term care currently live at home in the community, and unpaid family caregivers, primarily women,  provide 90% of their care.  Family caregivers find it necessary to leave their jobs to care for family members, or must juggle both the caregiver role while providing care.  The role is both physically and emotionally draining.   Most caregivers face an escalating challenge that they are not prepared for and have no training for.   
Knowing  how to care for a loved one with dementia is not something we learn in school or through life experience.  It's a crash course with tests we are totally unprepared for.  The Dealing with Dementia workshop gives caregivers proven strategies for dealing with a number of issues.
This project is starting in Maryville, Tennessee, USA but my hope is to expand it's reach across the United States and beyond.

<p>We came, we saw, we built a giant butt in the middle of the desert! And the reception was <strong>AMAZING</strong>.

THE PROBLEM



4.5 TRILLION, yes, TRILLION, cigarette butts are littered throughout the world each and every year.  That’s OVER 8 MILLION a minute. AND, cigarette butts take up to 10 YEARS to degrade.  SO. NOT. SUSTAINABLE.
Made of non-biodegradable cellulose acetate—a type of plastic—cigarette BUTTs are the MOST LITTERED PLASTIC ITEM IN THE WORLD (and arguably the smelliest).
Cigarette butts start countless forest fires, leach toxins into the ground and waterways, and to top that off that kids eat them, fish eat them, birds eat them. AND cigarette butts make their way back into our food supply. Worst of all, it's 2019 and it's still socially acceptable to flick them on the street.
Sadly, cigarette butts are one of most commonly MOOPed items on the Playa as well.
   THE SOLUTIONWe are raising funds to do SOMETHING POSITIVE about toxic litter.Your contribution will directly support us to:

BUILD the art piece: 'THE BUTT' Its construction will raise awareness of the issue and also serve as a recycling station for cigarette butts

DISTRIBUTE OVER 1,000 REUSABLE  POCKET ASHTRAYS to burners to leep
the playa clean and recycle ♻️ their waste. Individuals can use their pocket ashtrays for years to come, potentially saving our streets from tons of toxic waste.

Now, we are asking for your love and support in achieving our goals and keeping the planet clean.Every dollar contributed will go directly to the BUILD of our ART PIECE and the PRODUCTION of the REUSABLE POCKET ASHTRAYS, which, of course, are made of recyclable materials!
For $5, we will give you or gift an ashtray in your honor during the Burn.
For $10, we will give you or gift TWO ashtrays in your honor.

<h2>Fired up to fire up!</h2>
<p>It’s been an exciting year of planning and building for the newly founded River Song Pottery in Plano, IL! Approaching the first firing, we have a few necessary and important steps to take care of before we can start the kindling and build the fire up to a blaze. </p>
<p>I’m stoked about how much we’ve accomplished so far! </p>
<ul>
<li>We purchased five acres of land in Plano. Plenty of space for pallets of wood, and for industrious potters to build more wood kilns!</li>
<li>It's wooded! Unlike most of Illinois! We have befriended a neighbor/landscaper who has already donated a year's worth of firewood at the property. We have split enough wood for the first two firings.</li>
<li>The property came with a sizeable barn. A two-story section will eventually be framed out to become studio space and a gallery. </li>
<li>The kiln room was built in an addition, which will protect me from the harsh winters. I was diagnosed with Reynaud's syndrome last winter, so having walls and space heaters on days when we load the kiln will save me from some nerve pain. It will also prevent everyone involved from being overly cold. Bonus!</li>
<li>Ted Neal came out to oversee the kiln build.  Having him assess the barn before we started the build was a fantastic decision. The week we built the kiln was a joy—Ted answers questions and teaches new skills with a patience and thoroughness much appreciated by myself and the crew of volunteers who came out to help!</li>
<li>The kiln room has been torn down and rebuilt, taller and safer. Lots of barn doors to open the room up when the kiln gets toasty.</li>
<li>There's a river. Although that's not important for wood firing, my son is obsessed with fishing. So it sold him on purchasing the property.</li>
<li>There are a few, super friendly outdoor cats! Not particularly pertinent to firing kilns, no matter how you feel about cats, this was the selling point for my daughter. </li>
</ul>
<h3>What we're building</h3>
<p>A kiln this size will be an asset in the Chicagoland area. It's 70 minutes from downtown. Maybe a *little* longer at rush hour on a Friday.

<h3>A little background</h3>
<p>I have been working in clay since my freshman year of high school. At Hope College, I graduated with a BA in Studio Art with an emphasis in Ceramics. I moved to Virginia for a teaching job (well, also to follow my high school sweetheart and now husband) and taught ceramics casually at night at our church.</p>
<p>After we had our two children, I was a full-time mom in Illinois, without a studio. As they entered preschool, I had heard from my high school teacher that Waubonsee Community College had a fantastic ceramics program. Having classes and open studio available away from the house was such a blessing. My hours were very casual through the preschool and kindergarten years and expanded as the kids’ school days grew longer. Six months into my time there, I participated in a wood firing for the first time*.  For five years, I continually took classes at the college—it’s a fantastic environment for exploration and learning. </p>
<p>One year ago, I decided it was time to leave the comfort of the college setting and seriously consider the next step and settle on where to live and what type of kiln to build. We explored the idea of moving to North Carolina--my husband was looking for a new job at the same time I was dreaming of starting a business. In the heart of pottery country, we fell in love with properties that have a home, studio, and wood kiln all in one spot. </p>
<p>We decided to stay in Illinois and keep our kids in their schools, and my husband started a great new job. Lots of time on Zillow and lots of research on zoning** found us a great spot to build a kiln (right away), a studio (as time and finances allow), and eventually a home.</p>
<p>At the same time we were exploring properties, I enjoyed firing with friends and experiencing how a catenary arch kiln fires, teamed up with others at a clay center to fire a gas/soda kiln, and appreciated firing a wood/salt/soda kiln and unloading its lovely results.</p>
<p>I kept coming back to the train kiln at Waubonsee. I loved loading it, understood firing it, and appreciate the rich and earthy surfaces deposited on the work. Sixty cubic feet of loading space would allow me to fire just several times per year-- a reasonable trade of lost sleep (the firings can range from 36 to 48 hours) for a good amount of pottery!</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to help build a kiln of that type and size at Simon Levin's pottery*** over the winter. It is great fun laying brick. It's also humbling!

It’s been an exciting year of planning and building for the newly founded River Song Pottery in Plano, IL! Approaching the first firing, we have a few necessary and important steps to take care of before we can start the kindling and build the fire up to a blaze. 
I’m stoked about how much we’ve accomplished so far! 

We purchased five acres of land in Plano. Plenty of space for pallets of wood, and for industrious potters to build more wood kilns!
It's wooded! Unlike most of Illinois! We have befriended a neighbor/landscaper who has already donated a year's worth of firewood at the property. We have split enough wood for the first two firings.
The property came with a sizeable barn. A two-story section will eventually be framed out to become studio space and a gallery. 
The kiln room was built in an addition, which will protect me from the harsh winters. I was diagnosed with Reynaud's syndrome last winter, so having walls and space heaters on days when we load the kiln will save me from some nerve pain. It will also prevent everyone involved from being overly cold. Bonus!
Ted Neal came out to oversee the kiln build.  Having him assess the barn before we started the build was a fantastic decision. The week we built the kiln was a joy—Ted answers questions and teaches new skills with a patience and thoroughness much appreciated by myself and the crew of volunteers who came out to help!
The kiln room has been torn down and rebuilt, taller and safer. Lots of barn doors to open the room up when the kiln gets toasty.
There's a river. Although that's not important for wood firing, my son is obsessed with fishing. So it sold him on purchasing the property.
There are a few, super friendly outdoor cats! Not particularly pertinent to firing kilns, no matter how you feel about cats, this was the selling point for my daughter. 

What we're building
A kiln this size will be an asset in the Chicagoland area. It's 70 minutes from downtown. Maybe a *little* longer at rush hour on a Friday. This makes the site available to a lot of potters interested in wood firing! It will be the main site for several full-time potters to fire their work. There will be plenty of room for artists dabbling in wood fire as well. I also plan to host visiting artist workshops once per year to hand over the reins of the kiln, learn from others' expertise, and see what variation comes from the firings!
The art scene is taking hold beautifully in Downtown Aurora. Just down the river from the property, Aurora hosts First Fridays as well as numerous art fairs and other events ready for ceramics to hold a larger presence. 
At the barn, a small gallery will welcome drop-in visitors, and we will hold kiln unloading parties outdoors. 
What we need
We are in the final push for expenses leading up to the first firing this October. Still to come before we start the kindling...
Approximately $8,000 more for metal siding. The barn where the kiln lives currently has rotted wood siding, which is a safety issue. 
The kiln room needs to be lined with cement board to protect the framing--$5500.
$400 for bricks-- we need a slightly taller chimney!
$1500 for kiln shelves. Pottery is loaded onto special shelves that can withstand the high temperatures and environment of the wood kiln. They are surprisingly pricey when you purchase 30 of them.
$20,000 to purchase a tiny house for a business partner. Just kidding. Kind of. This would be our (incredible) stretch goal!
Lofty goals, I realize! If we fall short of our fundraising goals, the next steps of hosting workshops and framing out a studio will be delayed.

<h2>
<br/>Masks in the Aftermath</h2>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p><i><strong>Background</strong></i><br/>Like all segments of Virgin Islands society, practicing artists, arts and cultural organizations were impacted greatly by the 2017 hurricane season. As a part of the Virgin Islands’ recovery, the St. John Arts and Culture Long-Term Recovery Group (STJACRC) was formed under the fiduciary sponsorship of the Community Foundation of St. John and the St. John Angels in March 2018. STJACRC, which includes arts organizations such as The St. John School of the Arts, St.JanCo and the Gri Gri Project, initiated several outreach projects geared towards helping the arts &amp; cultural community on St. John. </p>
<p>One of these began in May of 2018: a community wide project, <strong>Mask Making as a Tool for Community Expression and Healing in the Aftermath of the 2017 Hurricane Season.  </strong>The project mirrored a variety of community public art and art therapy projects that have been successful in supporting the emotional and social recovery process after disasters. Thanks to the National Endowment for the Arts for inspiring us to do this project and their ongoing support.<br/><br/>                              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_450/v1560201627/fy87wey50bfxom3rajwk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The project targeted students, senior citizens and other community members, schools and organizations on St. John. The goal was to reach as many residents, youths and organizations as possible. Participants were encouraged to imagine new identities, new selves, new ways of being in the storms’ aftermath.</p>
<p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_400/v1560211472/k7yxc7wq2muhqn7udeza.jpg"" src=""""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_225/v1560205165/w80vrlsmjheyfpl2vwoe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><br/>Over 500 people participated in making masks that were then publicly displayed and viewed by thousands of residents and visitors. This process helped to build community and introduce an aesthetic to the recovery that suggests both newness and is rooted in cultural heritage.</p>
<p>      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_325/v1560219113/fpgj1jpggfhai5aymw9i.jpg"" src=""""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_325/v1560222210/bspu2kmzzxkcddxsfgek.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><br/>Although the mask-making itself came to an end, the masks and their stories continued to share our experiences and efforts to heal and move forward. For example, students at the St. John School of the Arts incorporated the masks as part of their St. John 2018 Festival Troupe.</p>
<p>             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_300/v1560859758/qiaszsyihhnaa7buyfst.jpg"" src=""""/>       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_300/v1560860678/qfsf1ibfxxbb3uzi1r7h.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>                                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_500/v1560859047/etjhntuwyxk7neugqo4g.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Many masks were also displayed at the Department of Interior’s Library in Washington D.C.  in the fall of 2018.</p>
<p>      <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_325/v1560223014/bdfedqqzg5brx20czlal.jpg"" src=""""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_325/v1560223707/kacs13budxbiohdcyp6q.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>The masks and their stories were then documented in a 12-minute film directed by project team member Dr. Crystal Fortwangler and produced by St. John’s Arts and Cultural Long-Term Recovery Group Co-Chairs, Kurt G. Marsh, Jr. and Priscilla Hintz Rivera Knight. William Stelzer joined as part of the film team, filming the documentary, assisted by Crystal and St. John high school student Ameir Sprauve. (See film inset directly below).</p>
<p>       </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/341231092"" width=""640""></iframe></div> <p></p>
</div><p> </p><p>Research has shown that community art projects and art therapy have been effective in carrying out creative community-building, which is essential in the disaster recovery process. This has been our collective experience on St. John after the hurricanes. Our experience has shown us that art programs help communities heal and recover.</p><p><br/><i><strong>Current Project &amp; Indiegogo Campaign</strong></i><br/>Post-storms we want the masks and their stories to continue circulating! To help in this way the Virgin Islands Council on the Arts (VICA) committed to partially funding a book project that highlights over 100 masks made in the project. VICA awarded us $5,000 and we are seeking an additional $5000 as part of this Indiegogo Campaign to bring this beautiful book to the public. Sales from the book will support a newly created <i>St. John Arts &amp; Cultural Emergency Fund</i>. The fund is being established by the Arts &amp; Culture Recovery Committee of St. John (ACRC) with the fiduciary support of the Community Foundation of St. John. Once established, the fund will help support arts &amp; cultural practitioners and organizations during times of disaster or an unforeseeable economic need. Our goal is to provide meaningful and timely relief and recovery assistance.</p><p>We also found a way to link the mask-making art-therapy project to a broader goal. While making the short film about the mask-making project, we became additionally cognizant of the critical need for improved access to mental health. There is an extraordinary need for greater mental health support in our islands, and even more so in the aftermath of disasters. A few months ago, in March 2019, VI Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. declared a mental healthcare emergency in the U.S. Virgin Islands because of a  shortage of psychiatric physicians and behavioral health providers. We believe producing a feature length documentary film can help make the case for professional art-therapy programs in the USVI. Through the film we want to demonstrate the success of this project (plus another VI art-based therapeutic program) and additionally promote professional art-therapy and mental health programs in the USVI. We will interview mental health care providers in the USVI, art-therapy professionals with the American Art Therapy Association, and include more interviews with people involved in the mask-making project.</p><p>The film will also be valuable for communities across the Caribbean who also face the need to heal and recover post-hurricanes, but also communities around the world who face all types of disasters.</p><p> </p><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your contribution is greatly appreciated! Monies received will be used in the ways listed below.</p>
<p><strong><i>Book Funding</i></strong><br/>1. We will spend $5000 to print a bulk order of <i>Masks in the Aftermath </i>to ensure a great price. We will then sell these books and 100% of the sale price will go to the <i>St. John Arts &amp; Cultural Emergency Fund </i>(described above). <i> </i><br/><br/><strong><i>Documentary Film Funding</i></strong><br/>1. Filming more interviews! We need $3000 to conduct 5 more key interviews for the film. Three interviews are on St. John, one on St. Thomas or St. Croix, and one stateside. The interviews on St. John are with (1) a high school student who made the mask that appeared on the cover of the recent <i>NEA Arts Magazine</i> (National Endowment for the Arts, 2019),  (2) a teacher who gave workshop for children at Julius Sprauve School, and (3) a St. Johnian artist who has provided an art-therapy oriented program previously in the USVI. The interview on St. Thomas or St. Croix will be with a mental health care provider who can speak to the need for art-therapy oriented support programs in the USVI. The interview stateside will be with a leading scholar in the art-therapy profession. Money will also be spent on travel &amp; accommodation expenses to St. Thomas/St. Croix and stateside, and paying our camera operator to work with our Director to film the interviews (in USVI).</p>
<p>2. Sponsoring and Filming an Art-Therapy Information Workshop in USVI! We need $2500 to sponsor this workshop open to the public, and conduct two additional interviews with the practicing art-therapists who travel to USVI to present a informational workshop about the practice of art-therapy. The interviews and material from the workshop will be included in the film. Money will be spent on travel &amp; accommodations for the two art-therapists to get to USVI.</p>
<p>3. Making Music! $6000 is needed to hire musician and composer Victor Provost and a team working with him to create an original soundtrack for the film. A professional audio mix moves a film from good to amazing. This is one of the most expensive aspects of film (thankfully we have supportive musicians giving us a great price).</p>
<p>4. Editing &amp; Graphics! Editing &amp; graphic design is an expensive part of film production as it takes a considerable amount of time. We need $6500 to cover the final editing and graphics for the film. This rate is discounted as we are donating much of our time to finish the film.<br/><br/><strong><i>General Funding </i></strong><br/>1. Rewards! It costs money to create the perks. We estimate we will need $1000 to cover these costs (any perks created and not sold as part of this campaign will be sold at Bajo El Sol Gallery and 100% of sales will be donated to the <i>St. John Arts &amp; Cultural Emergency Fund</i>).</p>
<p>2. Paying Indiegogo! Without IndieGogo we wouldn't be able to run this campaign and connect with you! We need an additional $960 to cover these costs (that is 4% of our goal of $24,000).<br/><br/><strong><i>Funding Goal</i></strong><br/>The total amount we need then is $24,960. Rounding up just a small amount for convenience - our funding goal is $25,000. Please help us reach the goal!<br/> </p>

The Project
 
BackgroundLike all segments of Virgin Islands society, practicing artists, arts and cultural organizations were impacted greatly by the 2017 hurricane season. As a part of the Virgin Islands’ recovery, the St. John Arts and Culture Long-Term Recovery Group (STJACRC) was formed under the fiduciary sponsorship of the Community Foundation of St. John and the St. John Angels in March 2018. STJACRC, which includes arts organizations such as The St. John School of the Arts, St.JanCo and the Gri Gri Project, initiated several outreach projects geared towards helping the arts & cultural community on St. John. 
One of these began in May of 2018: a community wide project, Mask Making as a Tool for Community Expression and Healing in the Aftermath of the 2017 Hurricane Season.  The project mirrored a variety of community public art and art therapy projects that have been successful in supporting the emotional and social recovery process after disasters. Thanks to the National Endowment for the Arts for inspiring us to do this project and their ongoing support.                              
The project targeted students, senior citizens and other community members, schools and organizations on St. John. The goal was to reach as many residents, youths and organizations as possible. Participants were encouraged to imagine new identities, new selves, new ways of being in the storms’ aftermath.
        
          
Over 500 people participated in making masks that were then publicly displayed and viewed by thousands of residents and visitors. This process helped to build community and introduce an aesthetic to the recovery that suggests both newness and is rooted in cultural heritage.
        
                                             
Although the mask-making itself came to an end, the masks and their stories continued to share our experiences and efforts to heal and move forward. For example, students at the St. John School of the Arts incorporated the masks as part of their St. John 2018 Festival Troupe.
                                                    
Many masks were also displayed at the Department of Interior’s Library in Washington D.C.  in the fall of 2018.
         
The masks and their stories were then documented in a 12-minute film directed by project team member Dr. Crystal Fortwangler and produced by St. John’s Arts and Cultural Long-Term Recovery Group Co-Chairs, Kurt G. Marsh, Jr. and Priscilla Hintz Rivera Knight. William Stelzer joined as part of the film team, filming the documentary, assisted by Crystal and St. John high school student Ameir Sprauve. (See film inset directly below).
        
 Research has shown that community art projects and art therapy have been effective in carrying out creative community-building, which is essential in the disaster recovery process. This has been our collective experience on St. John after the hurricanes. Our experience has shown us that art programs help communities heal and recover.Current Project & Indiegogo CampaignPost-storms we want the masks and their stories to continue circulating! To help in this way the Virgin Islands Council on the Arts (VICA) committed to partially funding a book project that highlights over 100 masks made in the project. VICA awarded us $5,000 and we are seeking an additional $5000 as part of this Indiegogo Campaign to bring this beautiful book to the public. Sales from the book will support a newly created St. John Arts & Cultural Emergency Fund. The fund is being established by the Arts & Culture Recovery Committee of St. John (ACRC) with the fiduciary support of the Community Foundation of St. John. Once established, the fund will help support arts & cultural practitioners and organizations during times of disaster or an unforeseeable economic need. Our goal is to provide meaningful and timely relief and recovery assistance.We also found a way to link the mask-making art-therapy project to a broader goal. While making the short film about the mask-making project, we became additionally cognizant of the critical need for improved access to mental health. There is an extraordinary need for greater mental health support in our islands, and even more so in the aftermath of disasters. A few months ago, in March 2019, VI Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. declared a mental healthcare emergency in the U.S. Virgin Islands because of a  shortage of psychiatric physicians and behavioral health providers. We believe producing a feature length documentary film can help make the case for professional art-therapy programs in the USVI. Through the film we want to demonstrate the success of this project (plus another VI art-based therapeutic program) and additionally promote professional art-therapy and mental health programs in the USVI. We will interview mental health care providers in the USVI, art-therapy professionals with the American Art Therapy Association, and include more interviews with people involved in the mask-making project.The film will also be valuable for communities across the Caribbean who also face the need to heal and recover post-hurricanes, but also communities around the world who face all types of disasters. 
What We Need & What You Get
Your contribution is greatly appreciated! Monies received will be used in the ways listed below.
Book Funding1. We will spend $5000 to print a bulk order of Masks in the Aftermath to ensure a great price. We will then sell these books and 100% of the sale price will go to the St. John Arts & Cultural Emergency Fund (described above).  Documentary Film Funding1. Filming more interviews! We need $3000 to conduct 5 more key interviews for the film. Three interviews are on St. John, one on St. Thomas or St. Croix, and one stateside. The interviews on St. John are with (1) a high school student who made the mask that appeared on the cover of the recent NEA Arts Magazine (National Endowment for the Arts, 2019),  (2) a teacher who gave workshop for children at Julius Sprauve School, and (3) a St. Johnian artist who has provided an art-therapy oriented program previously in the USVI. The interview on St. Thomas or St. Croix will be with a mental health care provider who can speak to the need for art-therapy oriented support programs in the USVI. The interview stateside will be with a leading scholar in the art-therapy profession. Money will also be spent on travel & accommodation expenses to St. Thomas/St. Croix and stateside, and paying our camera operator to work with our Director to film the interviews (in USVI).
2. Sponsoring and Filming an Art-Therapy Information Workshop in USVI! We need $2500 to sponsor this workshop open to the public, and conduct two additional interviews with the practicing art-therapists who travel to USVI to present a informational workshop about the practice of art-therapy. The interviews and material from the workshop will be included in the film. Money will be spent on travel & accommodations for the two art-therapists to get to USVI.
3. Making Music! $6000 is needed to hire musician and composer Victor Provost and a team working with him to create an original soundtrack for the film. A professional audio mix moves a film from good to amazing. This is one of the most expensive aspects of film (thankfully we have supportive musicians giving us a great price).
4. Editing & Graphics! Editing & graphic design is an expensive part of film production as it takes a considerable amount of time. We need $6500 to cover the final editing and graphics for the film. This rate is discounted as we are donating much of our time to finish the film.General Funding 1. Rewards! It costs money to create the perks. We estimate we will need $1000 to cover these costs (any perks created and not sold as part of this campaign will be sold at Bajo El Sol Gallery and 100% of sales will be donated to the St. John Arts & Cultural Emergency Fund).
2. Paying Indiegogo! Without IndieGogo we wouldn't be able to run this campaign and connect with you! We need an additional $960 to cover these costs (that is 4% of our goal of $24,000).Funding GoalThe total amount we need then is $24,960. Rounding up just a small amount for convenience - our funding goal is $25,000. Please help us reach the goal!

<h3>The Story of Two Medicine Silver</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Kara, the maker behind Two Medicine Silver. I am a self-taught silversmith, writer, and mother  working and living near the beautiful Rocky Mountains of Montana. I starting silversmithing full-time almost one year ago, after months of  building up my tool and knowledge repertoire completely on my own. Throughout this last year, I have grown and learned so much as an artist and entrepreneur, but now it’s time to take a huge step. </p>
<p>I have run out of room. My studio, aka the back room/storage room/freezer room/entryway, has started to limit my ability to create and grow. I have made the most out of every inch, but the space has reached it’s maximum capacity. </p>
<p> That’s where the dream arose.  </p>
<p>An external studio: built by our own hands from logs gathered and milled by my husband and I, powered by solar energy, made with reclaimed materials, and enough square footage  to create  and share that power of creation with the community! </p>
<p>This studio build is something that will be the future of my business. It will allow me the space to grow my skills and offer higher-quality, more diverse silver jewelry to my customers. Beyond that, the  more I am able to grow, the more I am able to share. I believe in the power of art and of creativity. With this space, I hope to offer community classes to teach other the art of silversmithing. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here’s the Plan</h3>
<p>There’s an “aim for the moon, and hope you land among the stars” sort of situation going on here— I am aiming high for funding, but it’s very important to me to remain as economical as possible while still building a beautiful, creative space. </p>
<p>The majority of the funding will go towards the building itself. We plan to log and mill the wood we will use, and utilize our local ReStore for doors, windows, and any other necessary bits and pieces we can find. I want to limit the consumption of new building materials as much as is possible. Reduce, reuse, recycle is the name of the game. </p>
<p>The next step will be adding a sustainable energy and heating  source. Once the building is completed, funding will go toward solar power installation.</p>
<p>If by chance I am lucky to have enough left over, all remaining funds will go towards upgrading my safety systems (fume and particulate extraction) and  growing my tool arsenal.  Things such as adding casting equipment and a rolling mill to eliminate my silver waste, purchasing more advanced shaping and cutting tools, and adding multiples of the basic to be able to offer classes to the community will be where any remaining funds will be spent. </p>
<h2> </h2>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My biggest hope is for this to impact my community.  Augusta is a small, rurual town and I would love to offer another opportunity for space of creation for the residents here. Augusta also relies quite heavily on tourism in the summer, so to add another viable stop that could produce more revenue in our town would be fantastic. </p>
<p>Beyond that, the  impact building this studio would have on my success in growing this business and creating life-long pieces of quality silver  jewelry is immeasurable. Having space to house all the tools necessary to create  pieces of work that are of heirloom-quality— something that will last a family for generations— is the goal. Having a space to be successful and a female, a mother, and an entrepreneur is the goal. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Of Course this Won’t be Easy...</h3>
<p>Nothing about creating this business has been. Between balancing work and family, squeezing every bit budget as far as it can go, learning an art form from scratch, and becoming an entrepreneur with no real educational background in business theory or marketing, I think it’s safe to say hard work doesn’t scare me.</p>
<p>And nothing about building this studio will be easy work. But it’s important work. To create a sustainable business space with community  ties is something I must do. Whether it takes me a few months or a few years to raise enough, save enough, and learn enough, I will never stop working for it. </p>

I'm John Hilmes, designer of Osmos. During last year's maiden playa voyage, we learned a lot about how Osmos performs in high winds and how folks like to use the space in the desert. The 21' tall pavilion proved a relaxing place to meditate, do yoga, stare up at the cosmos, hang with friends, take a nap, and ""get the led out"". Now we're building on the successes of last year by adding a soft, custom inflatable floor, turning Osmos into a bounce house with many uses on playa and beyond.

For 2019, we're looking to raise $6800 to cover the fabrication of a set of two, heavy-duty, drop-stitch inflatables. 
The design is composed of two parts.

The outer ring is 23' in diameter and 20cm thick, and fits snugly inside the base of Osmos itself.

<br/>
</div><p>Prior to the recent onset of the asexual movement, almost all aces lived their entire lives feeling broken, alone, and unsure of where they fit in the world. Since David Jay started the ace movement in 2001, we have seen a strong community develop out of this 1% of the population that has finally discovered that many others are like them. The movement has since grown to a point where more than 100,000 people have joined various online platforms, yet when estimates show that there are more than 5 million aces in North America alone, there is clearly work still to be done. </p><br/><p>Today, both mainstream society and LGBTQ+ spaces still widely erase, ignore, and discriminate against ace identities, leaving many aces feeling isolated and ostracized.

Founded in 2014 after two of our directors were instrumental in the hosting of an international asexuality conference for about 250 attendees, Asexual Outreach has quickly grown to become Canada’s leading ace organization, and an internationally recognized support and advocacy group. Given these accomplishments, we are uniquely suited to spearhead the next major growth of the ace movement, and we certainly have the resources to do so. With both an extensive network of contacts and a dedicated, innovative team, we have built the infrastructure needed to succeed, and are ready to do so.</p><br/><br/><h3><br/></h3><div>

Spreading awareness and education is not a simple task, so with your help, we can go further faster and achieve our goals. From the North American Asexuality Conference to resource kits in schools and beyond can all be made possible with the support of people like you! Join the effort and help make ace history!


Prior to the recent onset of the asexual movement, almost all aces lived their entire lives feeling broken, alone, and unsure of where they fit in the world. Since David Jay started the ace movement in 2001, we have seen a strong community develop out of this 1% of the population that has finally discovered that many others are like them. The movement has since grown to a point where more than 100,000 people have joined various online platforms, yet when estimates show that there are more than 5 million aces in North America alone, there is clearly work still to be done. Today, both mainstream society and LGBTQ+ spaces still widely erase, ignore, and discriminate against ace identities, leaving many aces feeling isolated and ostracized. This is where Asexual Outreach comes in!As the first and only national registered ace non-profit organization in the world, we plan to provide essential services to the ace community and to our allies. Founded in 2014 after two of our directors were instrumental in the hosting of an international asexuality conference for about 250 attendees, Asexual Outreach has quickly grown to become Canada’s leading ace organization, and an internationally recognized support and advocacy group. Given these accomplishments, we are uniquely suited to spearhead the next major growth of the ace movement, and we certainly have the resources to do so. With both an extensive network of contacts and a dedicated, innovative team, we have built the infrastructure needed to succeed, and are ready to do so.


Since Asexual Outreach is an organization staffed 100% by volunteers, the entirety of your contribution goes toward ace efforts and projects. We've got plenty of ideas and plans in the works to substantially benefit the ace community, including our annual North American Asexuality Conference, our high school outreach programs, our online intersectional community engagements, our comprehensive community event finder, an activist network as well as collaborative projects such as a book of works by ace authors.  Given our flexible conference ticket fee, we are not entirely sure how many funds will be raised through tickets, and so we may need to spend less of our campaign funds than expected on conference items; however, given our estimates, the first $10,000 - or our campaign goal - will be spent as follows:At least 90% of all stretch goal funds will go directly toward each goal's indicated program.


By supporting our campaign, you are directly contributing to the betterment of aces across North America. Not only are your donations directly supporting our nearby projects, you’re helping us to create a large funding base which we will be able to grow and draw from for years to come. 



We want to reciprocate the generosity you're showing to us, so we've created some fabulous perks to reward your kindness!








Our base $10,000 goal will allow us to ensure the success of the North American Asexuality Conference, will allow us financial stability for the next year, and will allow us to develop our high school resource kits, event finder, our weekly ace intersectionality articles and community engagements, and our formal activist network. With every stretch goal past that, however, we will be either expanding on one of our existing programs, or introducing an entirely new program to further the movement.





We have reached a point in our organizational process where we can absolutely guarantee our North American Asexuality Conference will occur in 2015. In addition, we are entirely confident that we will be able to fully develop all of our online resources and programs. However, should we fail to reach our funding goals, we may not have the financial means to adequately develop and distribute our high school resource kits and other informational materials, which would inhibit the potential growth of the ace movement.


Even if you don’t have the financial means to support our campaign, chances are, you know someone who does. Because the ace movement is still not at the forefront of discussion, we rely on our supporters sharing and spreading the word about our campaigns and projects. Even if you just share our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, or Tumblr, you’re still making an enormous impact, and for that we are incredibly grateful.Q: What will the High School Resource Kits include?A: Our resource kits will include a comprehensive, spiral bound book containing guides on how to make an LGBTQ+ club safe and inclusive for aces, and how to make schools and classrooms inclusive spaces. Additionally, this book will outline ace awareness activities and events that LGBTQ+ clubs can host, and ways to engage the school community in discussions around the ace spectrum. The book will feature distinct sections for student club leaders, for teachers, for guidance counsellors, and for administrators.Additionally, these resource kits will include a large number of our Ace 101, Issues Aces Face, and Ace Intersectionality leaflets that can be distributed to students. Other materials such as an ace-positive poster may also be included.We will be spending about $20 on the printing and shipping of each booklet so that we can ensure schools have ample resources needed to make ace-inclusive spaces.Q: Where can I register for the North American Asexuality Conference?A: You can find more information about and register for the North American Asexuality Conference, hosted in Toronto on June 20 and 21, on our website at http://asexualoutreach.org/2015/06/20/2015-north-american-asexuality-conference/.Q: How will the event finder work?A: There will be an interactive map on the “Find an Event” page on our website, where upcoming events will be pinned.

My name is Matthew P. Corley and I am raising funds to travel safely back to the United States. I have been on a personal quest of health and healing. My trip to Vilcabamba was also in efforts to bring supplies from the States to a family in need, and help them with their own fundraising campaign. Many close friends and family know that I suffer from chronic depression and anxiety. Every day is a struggle, some days easier than others. It is something I manage one day at a time, working with diet, exercise, and spiritual practice to overcome. Why Ecuador? Here I traveled to a small town called Vilcabamba, which is friendly to foreigners, where there is some of the purest water in the world and land that grows a variety of food: so living on a local raw food diet is practical and acquiring food is relatively inexpensive. I was thinking to live here but I realized that right now I am being pulled back to the US to continue connections and work that needs exploring. On returning I am hoping to stop in Colorado to spend time with my family (and hopefully friends) who I have not seen in a year.

So... <p>I am putting together a book of personal writing, poetic inspiration drawn from a life of ontological research into the philosophies of the Orient, of the Hermetic, and of the Indigenous Americas.

Additionally, numerous incentives for all contributors will be described in detail under the ""Perks"" section. Whatever you contribute to this cause will be very much appreciated, as we already thank you for taking the time to even read this pitch!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My name is Phil Hernandez and I am an artist trying to take my own path with an art career. I have been drawing for over 25 years and painting for about 6 years. I have an Associates degree in Graphic Design but unfortunately the school I attended and received my degree from lost a class action lawsuit and shut down. So it's been rather difficult trying to get even an entry level position with my education background. But I haven't allowed that from stopping me and pursuing my passion. I greatly enjoy the game 'Magic: the Gathering' and have found a way to combine both my life long passion of art and a hobby I've enjoyed for years.</p>
<p>What I am trying to do is get my art and my name out into the world. Seeing as Magic: the Gathering is a worldwide game, it helps greatly in what I plan to achieve. But to reach that audience and to have my art seen worldwide, I need as much help as I can get because I also plan on making this a career. Which is why I'm here. With any and all assistance here I will be able to get a good jump start on my goal.</p>
<p>All contributions here will greatly help with all the supplies needed for me to get a jump start on my goal. I see this goal as a career move that I am taking as I plan on continuing long term.

<p>For those who enjoy playing Magic: the Gathering, you know that having that one special card can make you stand out in the crowd with so much positive attention. Some may frown upon getting a nice card of value and having someone paint over it but for every 1 of those types of people, there will be dozens who will be envious of what you have. Then again, not many people are able to go out and afford altered cards, so this here is a great opportunity to get your hands on 1 or 2 or 4, or even a custom hand drawn playmat that no one else in the world will have but you.

<p>You may know me, you may not. My name is Stephanie, I'm 26 and I have been an artist since I could pick up a crayon. Those who know me have always been supportive of my goals as an artist, So far in my life, art has just been a hobby and I never thought I would be given the chance to support myself doing what I love. I recently have been given an opportunity to start a tattoo apprenticeship at Shadow of Comfort Tattoo. The shop is only a year old, but in that year it has been able to gain a name for itself in the industry here in Albuquerque as a welcoming, clean, friendly place that gives nothing but the best work to it's clients and friends. This is all thanks to the dream of the team that works here. Gilbert, Eric, Jessie and Cynthia believe that art comes first. They saw something in me and were willing to teach me what I needed to know to grow as an artist. They spend time, effort, and money helping me reach my goals. I want to repay them by becoming the best at what I do and help the shop continue to make a great name for itself. The next step in my apprenticeship is purchasing my equipment. Right now, I have about 10,000 dollars in student debt and am unable to take out a loan to purchase what I need. My parents are helping to support me while I continue my education so that I don't have to work full time and I couldn't be more grateful. I wouldn't have gotten this far without their help. However, there are things that I simply can't ask them to pay for after all they already do. If you are willing to donate to my cause, I would not only be able to continue this great opportunity, but I would also be able to continue to enhance my life.</p>
<p> I need to raise 1800 dollars for equipment and supplies. Anything helps. If I don't reach my whole goal, all the money will be put towards buying the equipment piece by piece.  For those of you who are interested, if you contribute to this growing process for me, I will do my best to use your body as my canvas during this learning experience. Gilbert and Jessie will be over my shoulder making sure nothing but the best work comes out of this shop. If Tattoos aren't a part of your plans for the future, I could paint you a custom piece of artwork. Just send me an e-mail at smalan@unm.edu with your name and donation amount and we can discuss what it is that I can do to help with your tattoo and art plans. And be sure to check out the amazing work that is done here at Shadow of Comfort Tattoo. You can visit our website at soctattoo.com or follow us on Facebook. Thank you! This business is very tough and I am sure that the road ahead will be a rough one. With your support and encouragement, I am sure I will be able to share my art and be successful. I believe I can help people feel better about themselves and make this world a more beautiful place.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help<br/>
</h3>I understand that not everyone can donate, but there are other ways you can contribute. If you share this with friends and family or even just like our Facebook page, then the shop will be able to get more exposure and the additional clients can help repay my debt to these awesome people here at SOC Tattoo! <br/><p>Love and blessings to all of you!</p>

Several years ago, purely by chance I stumbled upon a technique of using the leftover burnt paper scraps from the butts of marijuana cigarettes, commonly known as 'Roaches' to create all of the required tones and highlights in my artwork. Although I have generated a small following in the medical and recreational cannabis community, I now feel that it is time to reach out to a broader audience and more aggressively pursue my passion for art

For more about Cliff Maynard watch:  ""The Roach Paper Artist""





What is 'Roach Paper Art?'
For those unfamiliar with my process here are some things you should know:
The last bit of a joint left over after it has been smoked is called a 'Roach'.

The scrap of burnt paper after any remaining plant material (reefer) has been removed is called a 'Roach Paper'.
'Roach Papers' come in varying shades of browns & whites due to the discoloration inherent to the smoking process.
These brown tones are what I use  as my medium. By tearing, trimming and combining these bits of paper i am able to create every line and shadow. It's a lot like working a jigsaw puzzle but each ""piece"" represents a moment in time shared by friends.








Some of my recent projects. More in gallery.

What I Need.

Cover the costs involved in getting 'The Perks' offered for this fund raising campaign to you for your generous and timely contributions.

Bring more widespread attention to my artwork and its message.


Any amount over our goal will go to pay for a much-needed tech upgrade in the form of better video editing software and digital camera, both of which are needed for me to continue creating my 'timee-laps' movies like the one above and those in the 'Video Gallery' and on my YouTube channel.

<b><h3></h3></b>The Opportunity to Help Fulfill a Vision 

</h3>
<p>Focus on the Masters (FOTM) Founder and Executive Director Donna Granata will embark this summer on an ambitious project that will have far-reaching and long-lasting effects on our organization and our cultural community. She has been selected to participate in the prestigious Masters program at the <a href=""http://annenberg.usc.edu/AcademicPrograms/ArtsJournalism.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism</a>.  Beginning in July 2015 and ending in May 2016, the 9 ½ month program is designed to enhance her skills as a documentarian specializing in the arts. Utilizing the FOTM Archive and
Library as primary source material, Donna will
learn the latest digital recording and editing techniques,
innovative documentation procedures and entrepreneurial skills needed  to reach the widest possible
audience. The FOTM archive will serve as a living research laboratory unlike any project brought forth to the USC Annenberg School. Upon completion of the program, Donna will earn a Masters of Arts Degree in Communication &amp; Journalism Specializing in the Arts, making her an even stronger leader of Focus on the Masters.  While Donna is learning all of the latest and best practices, her loyal staff and volunteers will conduct numerous special events for members and the general public throughout the year.  <b>But, we need your help to make the coming year a success for Focus on the Masters! </b></p>

artist who recognized Donna’s enthusiasm and talent for
art.  She was encouraged to attend
Ventura College where she met <a href=""http://www.focusonthemasters.com/koch.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gerd Koch</a>, faculty member and accomplished
abstract expressionist.  He described
Donna as a “sponge,” her mind ready and eager to absorb all she could about art

Photography, where she earned a Bachelor of Science Degree and later

What is Focus on the Masters?





Focus on the Masters   is a non-profit, 501(c)(3), art appreciation program that documents, preserves and presents the works and lives of accomplished contemporary artists. The FOTM archive and library includes photographic portraits, audio and video interviews, digitized artwork and biographical research that encompass each artist's experiences, reflections and development. Not only is this rich resource made available to researchers, but FOTM also seeks to present it to a broad public through educational programs for all ages, notably the Learning to See Outreach program, a monthly Artist Spotlight Interview Series,
exhibitions, publications, and an extensive resource library. FOTM is the only biographical resource project of its kind in California. Its multiple projects are linked by a common mission: to demonstrate the importance of the arts to a healthy society by bringing highly accomplished artists to the forefront of the community. 





Who Is Donna Granata?

<br/>The Artfully Spiritual line was inspired by many of the lovely 
ladies I met through an online business class called B-School. I have 
always been interested in religion and spirituality and one of my first 
clay projects was a rather large Ganesha covered in henna patterns (not 
the one pictured). When I saw my fellow B-Schoolers sharing images of 
their crystal grids I was so intrigued by them and got to researching. I
 knew crystal grids could be so much more amazing if they were combined 
with animals and am really excited to offer this. I already have a mold 
for a sea turtle flower of life grid and am planing on developing a cat 
grid that incorporates the phases of the moon. I want  to combine the 
Sir Yantra with an animal but haven't settled on which one yet. If you 
have an idea, than this is the line for you. I would also like to create
 relief sculptures of various religious figures that could hang on the 
wall. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436771359/wrwodntnwjfk75jw3ubv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>The Adirondack Friends Line will focus around the animals of the 
Adirondacks. I am creating this line to reflect the area I live in. It 
will have products ranging from chipmunk coasters, to loon trivets, and 
snapping turtle pizza stones. The image above is of an early version of 
the pizza stone. The final product will be similar but not exactly the 
same. Mostly, it will be a bit more detailed in the texture of its 
shell. I have done extensive research into the technical aspects of 
pizza stones and am really excited to get started on this.  (Hint: the 
clay is sparkly!)<br/><br/>And now, let me tell you a bit more about what you will be helping to create and why I need your help:<br/><br/>My work combines art, animals, and every day objects in a way that amuses people, helps them to pause for a moment in their busy day, and maybe disturbs them a little bit. Since 2013 I have been lucky enough to work creatively everyday to help bring art into peoples' lives. I've tested many different product lines and strategies for turning my creative endeavors into products that people love. After much trial and error I realized that I and my work are best suited for custom designs. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436831628/hr0ngydo4y7qsebnzcum.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>I love working one on one with clients but with the way I work, I need to charge at least $500, if not more, for the highly involved pieces I create. My clients love my work but it has left me wishing I could also produce pieces at a lower price point.<br/><br/>Not everyone is able or wants to spend hundreds of dollars on art and the customers who helped to build my business in the first place can no longer afford my work. I feel very strongly that everyone deserves and needs to experience art in their life, so I have been searching for a way to make my work more affordable. I looked into licensing my designs and having them produced but the start up costs are in the thousands, most ceramic production is done overseas, and a minimum order of 1,000 units per design is required. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Why not simplify?<br/>
</h3>At first I tried to create simpler work but even with simpler designs, it was still labor intensive and customers weren't really interested in the dumbed down versions of my work. Then after making a plaster mold for a client's project I realized that if I work with certain shapes, I can use plaster molds to preserve my detailed style while greatly reducing the labor. With the reduction of labor, I can pass on lower prices to my customers. Having a lower priced mold made line will allow people who aren't looking for a custom order to experience art in their everyday life.<br/><br/>In order to start a small scale production line I need financial help to cover a few things. I could keep going at my current pace, creating a few molds whenever I can squeeze them in, but that would make putting out a cohesive product line, with lots of options for you to choose from, next to impossible. With your help I can devote enough time to each line so that they will be done in time to be given as Christmas gifts to yourself or others.<br/><br/>My biggest expense to get these going is the time that I need to devote to creating the molds. Molds have many steps that take up a lot of time and energy. While I am creating them I am unable to seek out and fulfill custom orders. By covering basic expenses like studio rent, I will be able to focus on getting molds made so I can start creating the new line. <br/><br/>I need some new materials such as special thermal shock resistant clay for things like pizza stones and mold making quality plaster, which strangely enough is not available to me locally. <br/><br/>I am also desperately in need of more storage space as my shelves are full and the floor is now covered with various molds and drying projects. A few new shelving units would create space to store both my molds and new work as it dries.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436831542/kkwkpjq79jquy3mjxmvd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>All of this can be covered in the $3,000 and anything raised over that will go towards things like boxes for shipping as I will need different shapes than what I have used in the past, product labels, and maybe even some advertizing.<br/><br/>

</div></div>","Now you can have your own animal house, without all the mess. 
Do you love animals and want your home to reflect your love? Does your dog need a food dish that looks like him and do you wish you had a cake stand that looked like a big squishy kitty? If so, I have plans for a sweet new home decor and pet product line that will suit all your needs. Each piece is made with intricate details and high quality materials making it a precious piece of art. The offbeat style is unique while the practical designs are durable enough to be used and enjoyed daily. With your help I can begin to create the work using a streamlined process that will make it available at an extremely affordable price range.
But first, I need help spreading the word about my campaign, so before I tell you about my work let me offer you a chance to win your own super small snail friend.To win him, simply share this campaign as a public post on social media as well as directly with any friends you think might like it. Then go to my page and let me know that you did, so I can give you credit. Once you learn about my story, if you decide you want to pre-order, it will count as a second chance towards winning this teeny tiny snail. Over to the right you can check out the specific perks that are 
available for pre-order. They are structured by price, size, and 
fall into three product lines:
The Furry Friends line will be composed of products ranging from 
little dishes and cheese boards for humans to pet food dishes of various
 shapes and sizes for our furry friends to enjoy. The focus will be on 
house hold pets such as mice, dogs, cats, and rabbits. If you would like
 to see your favorite animal friends incorporated into a functional 
ceramic product then this is the line for you!

</div></div>","Short Summary We have a huge opportunity to get our adorable AKC Dog Stamps into a larger market! But I need to have about 20 more sets of stamps ready to go! This $6500 covers all of the prep, packaging, costs.
But we have some really cool items as thank you perks for helping us!! Big discounts on the stamp sets, and more!!    What We Need & What You Get Break it down:  We are going to be spending the funds to get plates make of the 20 new designs that I will be hand drawing. I currently have more than twelve sets of these style stamps on my website. 
It will also cover the packaging and supplies. We are going to want your feedback! What breeds should I launch - I already have a list for the first 15 of the new sets, but i am going to open it up to my indiegogo fans to help with the last 5! 

I will be posting the dog breeds on an update so we can share which ones will be created.

The Impact  This is huge, it is a large box store that is interested if we can get them more samples and ready to go breeds!!     Risks & Challenges  They might not order them. I could jump all of the hoops and they still turn us down. But it would not be a total loss we offer our designs on Amazon and  a few other Scrapbook store locations. So they will still be available designs.
Challenges - TIME - They are hoping for a preview by January and a Launch of the stamps (if they pick us up) of March 2016!    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Please get the word out (facebook, twitter, periscope, etc) and make some noise about our campaign.

My mother was looking just amazing, and then I was told that my birthday party had to be delayed. At the moment, I realized something was wrong. Within 3 months of finding out that my mom had cancer, she perished. As time passes by, I do believe my mother was chosen by our Heavenly Father.  <i>""H</i><i>e who has ears to hear, let him hear."" Matthew 11:15.</i> I am so blessed to have realized my faith in Christ at an early age, being taught by my mom to look to Christ for my salvation and to Him alone. New Faith Baptist church in Matteson, IL is where I attend worship service.</p><p>I am also the<b> CEO of Soar Couture</b> founded by my mother.

We are committed to ""elevate the spirit"" and commission to spread the Gospel of our Lord and King, Jesus Christ through our dynamic fashion collection and gift accessories. My father (Otha Lacy) whom I love dearly, have given me the insight to stay focus with my deepest admiration. He teaches me not to just start something, but to finish it too. My mom started this business and I am going to try my best to keep her business up and running.</p><p>When I was a little girl, around six I had my own plan to start a business too. It was me, my granny, my auntie, and my mom. My mom was explaining her business to my aunt and granny when I interrupted and said “Hey, I have a business too.” My mom thinks I’m just saying whatever, but my aunt said “Hold on. I think she’s on to something here.""</p><p>So I explain my business plan. I told them that I was going to sell batteries. I would buy them from the dollar store for $1 and resell them for a higher price. My aunt asked “Why batteries?"" And I said, ""because little kids need batteries for their toys.” My aunt, interested in my plan asked, Who is going to work for you though? Well, my mommy is going to have a baby and when my little sister grows up she’s going to work for me. My mom replied, with a smile “that’s my baby. I am so proud of you.” So that was my little plan. I had it all figured out. But now I want to invest in other things. I would like to carry on my mom’s dream but would also like to be a lawyer or a writer.

My mother was looking just amazing, and then I was told that my birthday party had to be delayed. At the moment, I realized something was wrong. Within 3 months of finding out that my mom had cancer, she perished. As time passes by, I do believe my mother was chosen by our Heavenly Father.  ""He who has ears to hear, let him hear."" Matthew 11:15. I am so blessed to have realized my faith in Christ at an early age, being taught by my mom to look to Christ for my salvation and to Him alone. New Faith Baptist church in Matteson, IL is where I attend worship service.I am also the CEO of Soar Couture founded by my mother. I PRAY is our on-line retail store, a division of Soar Couture Limited distinctly and divinely designed to offer you fashion and faith...in perfect harmony. We are committed to ""elevate the spirit"" and commission to spread the Gospel of our Lord and King, Jesus Christ through our dynamic fashion collection and gift accessories. My father (Otha Lacy) whom I love dearly, have given me the insight to stay focus with my deepest admiration. He teaches me not to just start something, but to finish it too. My mom started this business and I am going to try my best to keep her business up and running.When I was a little girl, around six I had my own plan to start a business too. It was me, my granny, my auntie, and my mom. My mom was explaining her business to my aunt and granny when I interrupted and said “Hey, I have a business too.” My mom thinks I’m just saying whatever, but my aunt said “Hold on. I think she’s on to something here.""So I explain my business plan. I told them that I was going to sell batteries. I would buy them from the dollar store for $1 and resell them for a higher price. My aunt asked “Why batteries?"" And I said, ""because little kids need batteries for their toys.” My aunt, interested in my plan asked, Who is going to work for you though? Well, my mommy is going to have a baby and when my little sister grows up she’s going to work for me. My mom replied, with a smile “that’s my baby. I am so proud of you.” So that was my little plan. I had it all figured out. But now I want to invest in other things. I would like to carry on my mom’s dream but would also like to be a lawyer or a writer.

The instruction is not only in the arts though as Donda's House helps to transform a young person's life.  After our program, those who have dropped out are ready to re-enroll in school, they have a blueprint for their personal and professional future and they belong to a community of peers and mentors who make themselves available to be there during their challenges and to celebrate their successes. To date we have served 120 artists between the ages of 14 - 24 years old in Chicago.  
Our efforts to provide this opportunity for young people are currently under threat.  On Tuesday, January 27th, we had an Orientation for our Spring Programming. Then, on Thursday, January 28th, the State of Illinois sent an e-mail to over 18 agencies stating that “effective immediately”, funding for Spring Out of School (OST) Funding & Youth Employment Programs had been cut. On Friday, January 29th, we had to make the critical decision to either cancel our Spring Programming OR raise the funds. On Monday, February 2nd, we opened applications for our Spring 2015 Program, where we received a huge pool of applicants. 
Your contribution will send a resounding signal to our State Capital, and to the 60 youth we are enrolling in our Spring Program that art matters and it is the pulse of any healthy community.
   What We Need & What You Get 
We need $100,000 to pay for our Spring, Summer and Fall “Got Bars” Programs. This will support a total of 180 young artists. Your contribution will allow us to hire :

a Studio Recording Instructor - to teach the students studio etiquette and to produce and engineer the student’s original songs.

are by nature fragile, they can be exposed and read by a limited audience; a
manuscript is the outcome of dedication, a secret shared with few. The

Between visual art and literature, Clementina is a collaborative project born
one year ago after the acquaintance of Eva Marathaki and Giulia Casartelli in
Athens. 
Eva is an artist.
Giulia is a writer.
Eva’s drawings were for Giulia the trigger for a
new short story, Clementina, now enshrined
in a manuscript created by Eva.

In November 2015, the manuscript of Clementina will be exhibited at the Yeni
Djami of Thessaloniki, the last mosque built in the city in 1902, alongside with a number of selected
works and new productions by Eva.

Manuscripts
are by nature fragile, they can be exposed and read by a limited audience; a
manuscript is the outcome of dedication, a secret shared with few. The
manuscript, like the character of Clementina, carries the weight and the
fragility of a secret, echoed in the space and history of the Yeni Djami. 
In
the manuscript the story is presented in Italian and Greek and will be read by

environment to approach the story.

PERCHÉ CI SERVE IL VOSTRO AIUTO?

Clementina è un progetto indipendente.
Fino ad ora abbiamo beneficiato della
generosità di sostenitori in Grecia e all’estero che hanno offerto
suggerimenti, ospitalità e abilità per sostenere Clementina. In particolare vogliamo ringraziare la Municipalità di Salonicco, l'Istituto Italiano di Cultura di Atene, l'Hotel Olympia (Salonicco) e CRITERION I The Furnishing Approach (Salonicco).
Passo dopo passo, tutti insieme stiamo
rendendo questa mostra possibile.

per avere con noi un team di tecnici per creare una nuova installazione che
arricchirà la cupola della moschea, impreziosendo la presentazione del
manoscritto di Clementina.
Sarà possibile accedere alla documentazione
del montaggio della mostra sul sito che creeremo per il progetto e vedere così
il team all’opera. 
Puntiamo a raccogliere 8’000 euro. Sì,

Our IndieGoGo campaign has finished, but you can still help! Visit us at  transfamilyphotos.com to help us raise the remaining funds we need to fulfill our vision for a robust, traveling exhibit that will stand the test of multiple venues. You can also get up-to-date information there about our exhibit, contact us about bringing it to your location, and more!

The project This exhibit is a collaboration between Matthew Clowney, artist and photography professor at the Rhode Island School of Design, and Margaret Middleton, exhibit designer. 
We're making an art exhibit for children, featuring photographs of a family with a transgender grandparent. These
images will offer a window into the family life of Erica Tobias, her children, and grandchildren. The exhibit will debut at the Provincetown Library on Cape Cod for Family Equality Council's Family Week in late July. After its run in P-town, the exhibit will re-open at Boston Children's Museum in October. We hope to travel the exhibit to other venues after that.   Contributing to the campaign
Your contributions will fund signage, a wall system, printing and framing for the photographs, exhibit furniture, exhibit fabrication, possible expansion of the project.
Perks
 Contributors at all levels receive a free download of ""Pink Explosion"", our original campaign song by Tracie Potochnik.
Contributors at the $25 level and higher will get their name on a donor recognition panel that will hang in the exhibit.
$1000 contributors will get their very own family portrait by Matthew Clowney
...and we're working on adding additional perks throughout this fundraiser!    About the exhibitThe pictures, mostly done reportage style, are candid captures of Erica Tobias and her family, focusing on their relationships with one another. The centerpiece of the work will be a complete family portrait done in Matthew’s signature digital-composite technique. Accompanying signage in English and Spanish will be written to inspire dialogue between family members. Book Nook Cozy seating and a basket full of child-appropriate fiction and non-fiction books about family diversity and gender expression.Sharing Station A table and chairs with paper and color pencils and a display space where visitors can respond to prompts like, What does family mean to you? How has your family changed over time? What makes your family special? This is an opportunity 
for visitors to reflect on their own families’ unique qualities and share with others. An art exhibit for grown-ups vs. an art exhibit for children.
Why it's important 
Opinion polls show that people who know someone who is gay or lesbian are more likely to support equal rights for all gay and lesbian people. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that the same is true for people who know someone who is bisexual or transgender.
Human Rights Campaign
It's estimated that only 9% of Americans know someone who is transgender. We hope that visitors who see this exhibit will feel like they've gotten to know Erica and her family.
We also hope that some visitors will recognize themselves or their families in these images. It's so important for people, especially children, to see representations of who Laverne Cox calls ""Possibility Models"".

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p><b>Why
is the Don’t Turn Your Back on AIDS™ (DTYBOA) High School HIV Awareness
Art Program</b> <b>important?</b></p>
<p>HIV/AIDS
is not over. Surely, those who become infected with the disease today are no
longer doomed to only weeks and months to live longer, but it is a chronic
disease. It is a disease filled with isolation and alienation for so many. It
is a disease, still, filled with too much societal fear, stigma, and ignorance.
</p>
<p>Young
people today, and even some a generation or two from before, know nothing about
the scary images the public experienced in the 80’s and early 90’s when the
disease reached its epidemic height. Few parents and guardians feel comfortable
sharing these past horror stories with their teens knowing full well they are exploring
their sexuality and taking active risks.</p>
<p>At
Flowers Community Initiatives, we take the education and the nurturing of our
youth seriously. We provide a public service to young people and their
communities with compassion, dedication, and consistency. We consider our track
record a critical and important role that can still change the trajectory of a
single youth and keep one more teen from becoming infected with HIV disease. </p>
<p>According
to the Centers for Disease Control,  people under 25 are estimated to make
up HALF of all new HIV infections in the U.S. Sixty (60%) percent of new
HIV/AIDS cases reported each year are teenage girls aged 13-19.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fact: Many young people do not
     know the basic facts about HIV risk and prevention.  </li>
<li>Fact: A large number of young
     people participate in unprotected, multiple partnered, unsafe sexual
     activity, and lack critical information regarding the spread of HIV.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What
We Need </b></p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to reach our monetary campaign goal as quickly as possible in order
begin implementation of our 2015-2016 DTYBOA program.</p>
<p>After 9 consecutive years of educating and helping prevent HIV infection
among high school students through art education, we need your help. </p>
<p>We lost our funding. Next year is our 10th Anniversary of producing DTYBOA
in Bay Area High Schools. </p>
<p>We promote the program via DVD on HIV education to high schools. Teachers
build their curriculum around the art contest and use the program as a vehicle
for both inspiring creativity, learning art technique, and raising awareness on
this sensitive subject. Students are encouraged to create art works
such as sculptures, paintings, drawings, textile works and photographs around
the theme “Don’t Turn Your Back on AIDS”.</p>
<p>We offer underserved communities new opportunities. We level the playing
field by offering art supplies and materials, so that low income, predominantly
minority communities can participate. </p>
<p>Since it takes money to make money, we accept all non-monetary donations
that will enable us to offer “perks” in exchange to fund donors. Non-monetary
donations include the following: caps and t-shirts, art and ceramics, time-shares
and vacations, gift certificates for upscale tangible goods, restaurants, etc.</p>

<p><b>The

<p>Over

they witness in their young people who have been a part of our DTYBOA program.</p>
<p>On
the surface, we address HIV infection and empower artistic expression and understanding
about a global and social health dilemma. However, we have learned that teens
deal with and gain insight into so many other aspects of their personal lives
while working on their art pieces. They open up, they mature, and they meet
their true selves from the inside out for the first time.</p>
<p>To document the community response,
we asked an outsider to gauge our program’s achievements and successes. </p>
<p>According to a 2011 independent and
objective evaluation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eighty one percent (81%) of participating students

     others about HIV prevention.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

</div></div>","We are raising money for our Scholarship Fund in order to assist graduating high school seniors to go on to pursue their passion in the arts.  This includes all art forms including music, drama, painting, sculpture, design, ceramics, culinary, photography and anything else that is considered ""the Arts"".  





Background: Robert graduated from Otis Art Institute where he received his Master's degree in Fine Arts. He has been making high fire ceramics for over 50 years.  He and his wife, Patricia, created a scholarship fund 13 years ago to encourage art students to go on to college.  The fund has awarded 63 scholarships to date.  All the profit from the sales of Robert's porcelain and photography is awarded to graduating high school art students.




Purpose: By taking an expedition to Mount Everest, this campaign will promote awareness of our fund and give these young artists the recognition they deserve.  Robert strongly feels we need to acknowledge these emerging artists.
Goal: Our funding campaign will allow us to give more scholarships to other schools in Sonoma County.  ALL funds raised here will go directly to graduating high school students.  






What We Need & What You Get  We are looking to raise $15,000, all of which will go to graduating art students.  The cost of the trip itself will be funded by Robert. Help us reach our goal.  All shapes, sizes and colors will vary, every piece will be handmade, signed and numbered by Robert. 
Here is what we offer:









For a $35 donation, you will receive a SMALL hand-thrown tumbler finished with Robert's special crystalline glaze.  All pieces will be numbered and signed.




For a $55 donation, you will receive a larger hand-thrown tumbler finished with Robert's special crystalline glaze.  All pieces will be numbered and signed.




For a $75 donation, you will receive two larger hand-thrown tumblers finished with Robert's special crystalline glaze.  All pieces will be numbered and signed.




For a $100 donation, you will receive a limited edition piece that will be hand-thrown at the highest altitude that Robert reaches on Mount Everest.  He will start throwing at about 12,000 feet and will continue to throw at every plateau in an effort to reach the ultimate goal of over 17,000 feet.  The piece that is thrown at the highest altitude will be reproduced by casting and will be hand-signed, numbered and glazed in one of Robert's crystalline glazes. These will be limited to 200 pieces at which time the mold will be destroyed.



For a $500 donation, you will receive:

One set of 4 crystalline-glazed mugs
One limited edition piece (see the $100 item)

A One-Hour Demonstration for You and Your Friends



For ALL Contributions:


You have a choice to come to Robert's studio to meet him and pick up your pieces or they will be shipped at no cost.
 Whether the goal is reached or not, all funds go to graduating art students to assist them in pursuing their future in the arts. 

*Please note:



A tumbler is without a handle, as opposed to mugs that have a handle.


Colors, shapes, and sizes vary.




    The Impact  Our funding will allow us to expand to other schools which will allow us to give more scholarships in Sonoma County. 
We will be bringing attention to the need for more art in our schools In the last 13 years 63 scholarships have been awarded.
The evidence is in...""The arts create critical thinking"".  We need more young folks developing this skill. 
   Risks & Challenges There are many risks in climbing to the Mount Everest North base camp.  High altitude sickness and frostbite while Robert treks to altitude and works on the wheel are our main concerns.  The reason for throwing at different altitudes on the way up is to make sure that Robert is able to throw at least one piece on the mountain.

<p><b>Every one of us</b> has been impacted by illness and the need to heal. Whether it's yourself, family, partners, friends, mentors, coworkers... <b>and let us not forget</b>, those who witness illness daily and do the healing... doctors, nurses, paramedics, counselors, clergy.</p>

</div><div> <p>We will make every effort to match your request for facility, but some facility requests may not be able to be matched precisely. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Some hospitals only display a specific kind of art; for example, 19th century</li>
<li>Some medical facilities only accept artwork from those who were patients there</li>
<li>Children's hospitals, rehabs, elderly centers sometimes do not accept artwork containing frames or metal edges</li>
<li>Sometimes, politics! Ugggh.</li>
</ul>
<div>We will, however, make an alternative match keeping your interest group at heart, and with your knowledge. (An interest group would be, for example, neurology, chemo center, Crohn's and Colitis, lung cancer, adolescent psychiatry, etc., but at a different location if your first choice is not available).</div>

WHY ART FOR MEDICAL VENUES?


Every one of us has been impacted by illness and the need to heal. Whether it's yourself, family, partners, friends, mentors, coworkers... and let us not forget, those who witness illness daily and do the healing... doctors, nurses, paramedics, counselors, clergy.
Research has empirically demonstrated that exposure to fine art in medical settings lowers heart rates, stabilizes vital signs, strengthens motor and neurological skills, enhances memory, speeds healing, shortens hospital stays, increases mobility, strengthens appetite, decreases symptoms, reduces anxiety, improves mood, lowers the use of painkillers/tranquilizers/substances, heals trauma, reduces stress, increases joy, improves quality of life, and alleviates the burden of chronic disease. 
Doctors and medical professionals also benefit, with less burnout and ptsd from the daily witnessing of pain, distress,trauma and death.
Do this in honor of or in memory of a loved one, a colleague, a group, or a medical cause... or simply to make the world a more healing place! See naming and placement opportunities in Perks section!

WHY US?

1. I have 30+ years experience as an award-winning, published artist and designer in Miami, New York, Europe, India and Hong Kong. Click here for main website. 

 
2. I have exhibited at The Louvre Museum, Paris, SCOPE/Art Basel, Wynwood Miami, and many more. I was selected as one of seven of ""The Top American Artists in the Art for Healing Genre"" by American Arts and Medicine Blog. Click here for my fine art website.




3. I am Founder and Director of The Zen Tov Project for Healing Through the Arts, which you can Read About Here... and Watch a Video About Here.



In short, I am dedicated to the healing power of the arts.
Enough about me... Now about YOU!

WHY YOU?
Because we have all been impacted, and as a simple and beautiful act of tikkun olam, you can make the world a more healing place. 

WHY NOW? 



To quote Hillel:  



2. I have a vision issue, and I want to be sure to culminate my lifelong idea while I still see clearly. (I do get treated at Bascom Palmer, #1 eye hospital in the world, and one of the medical venues to whom I plan to contribute a series. You see how this project works? Give back, pay forward, inspire others.)



3. We are already planning! We are hoping to install my art pieces at Baptist Health Systems, UM Miller/Jackson Memorial, Sylvester Cancer Center, Bascom Palmer, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Moffitt Cancer Center, Harvard/Mass General, Johns Hopkins, private medical offices, and more. 



We are also planning a tile installation at University of Washington for survivors of sexual assault, and a wall mural in Manhattan in memory of a public figure (name to be announced upon completion).



What You Get



You get the opportunity at various levels to select the medical venue of your choice, the artwork(s) of your choice from my website, and to donate an entire piece or series in honor of or in memory of a loved one, a colleague, a group, or a medical cause... and more. See Perks section.


*Please consider getting together a group of family members, friends, colleagues, coworkers, or interested parties for a particular medical cause or venue, in order to pay for a Perk of higher value, allowing you to donate a piece or series that is meaningful to the group. Don't forget to ask your boss, a company or foundation to match your funds and get an even higher Perk. Send in one lump sum payment when you do this.






You also get a tax deduction (where applicable) letter, regular updates and photos, a full-color downloadable art catalog of the completed project, and most of all, a grateful heart for giving back and paying it forward.



What We Need 


Following are the costs of the project:




FRAMING - Most of the funds will go here

EMBEDDING OF LARGER PIECES INTO ARCHIVAL METAL - Most of the funds will go here

Engraved signage plaques for dedications
Art/photo/tech supplies
Printing of gallery size fine art photography
Secure hanging materials
Security features at hanging site
Labor costs and meals for installation assistants
Catalogs and announcements
Transportation and communications
Packing, shipping and insurance: US and overseas
Copyright filings/professional costs

Funds will be used as planned above, even if we do not reach our goal. We expect to reach our goal and continue our work in more healing venues across the US and elsewhere, including other artists that we work with after the initial monetary goal is met.

The Impact
 The impact of the dreaded white wall in a healing venue cannot be overstated. Research demonstrates heightened anxiety, depression, lack of energy, low motivation, heightened awareness of pain, loss of hope, and more...
Whereas... The impact of fine art on walls in a healing venue is powerful, on both a medical and a soul level.

The Risks 
 We will make every effort to match your request for facility, but some facility requests may not be able to be matched precisely. Here are a few examples:


Some hospitals only display a specific kind of art; for example, 19th century
Some medical facilities only accept artwork from those who were patients there
Children's hospitals, rehabs, elderly centers sometimes do not accept artwork containing frames or metal edges
Sometimes, politics! Ugggh.

We will, however, make an alternative match keeping your interest group at heart, and with your knowledge. (An interest group would be, for example, neurology, chemo center, Crohn's and Colitis, lung cancer, adolescent psychiatry, etc., but at a different location if your first choice is not available).



Don't Forget!


Make your secured payment here on Indiegogo.

Make your artwork selection by visiting www.tracyellyn-recentworks.com


Leave all your selection information and email on the Contact page on the www.tracyellyn-recentworks.com website. Your email is important! We will need to communicate about your selection, dedication verbiage, updates, tax letter, your free downloadable art catalog which will be available at end of campaign, and more.

<p>I wish to get your interest in
an internet internet art project which already exists and has great development
prospects. Details are presented below. First I describe what talent.pl is and
this is followed by my proposal. Than you in advance for considering your
financial and technical support. It is a fantastic way of promoting art and
artists worldwide! It is a new idea of presenting arts – not by infos but by
introducing artists and their works, letting all to admire what can be done by
men and women from all the globe. Talent.pl is very wide considering all forms
of arts that can be seen there. Talent.pl logo is in polish and is a trademark
but exists for now also in English and French. I love art and I am certain that
for every one of us this project will make life more beautiful. </p>

valuable forms of entertainment, who love various forms of art and who are keen
to support talented people and develop. The project is oriented on people who

talent.pl:</b></p>
<p>What I plan to do:</p>
<p>- the development of talent.pl
is now affected in particular three portals for different reasons:
pinterest.com (it is extremely simple, intuitive and accessible): it is easy to
navigate, it is fast and modern; behance.net: very stable, clear and quite
comprehensive; deviantart.com: nothing exciting about the site but the sales
system is simple and well developed,</p>
<p>- talent.pl should be composed
of four parts (it can be expanded afterwards but this will be the base): </p>
<p>1/ visual part /
for viewing (focus on the work and artist and on artist promotion),</p>
<p>2/ social part
(directly related to 1/): for communication with users and communication among
users (subject to the finally approved concept, we will exactly define what
will be permitted, e.g. contacts among users should trade in works is
permitted) – 1/ and 2/ 17000 dollars, </p>
<p>3/artistic
crowdfunding: practically non-existent in Poland but very much in demand – 5000 dollars,</p>
<p>4/ e-commerce: sale
of works – I would start with “image” works (to be followed by e-commerce in
other artistic categories, e.g. music: licences, transfer of economic
copyright) and similarly to deviantart.com I would not trade in originals (at
least not from the very beginning) but with copies – 3-4 options and 3 sizes
(e.g. small, medium, large). I would develop the trade with a mobile
application with which the phone can be approached to a wall to select a
picture/photograph and place them on a wall determining sizes (e.g. the
application of Dulux paints – you can change the colour of the wall and decide
about all details). If we decide to go ahead with that, I have a well skilled
person involved in e-commerce – 5000 dollars,</p>
<p>Apart from Polish,
I would also use the following language versions: English, French, Russian, Spanish
and Chinese.</p>
<p>Sources of revenues of
talent.pl: e-commerce, advertising campaigns, announcements (people looking for
specific artists to develop specific items), artistic patronage, golden
accounts (here I would combine all payable options (not all but selectively)
and make three options: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months). Additionally, I would
also think about an automatic option of advertising campaigns at talent.pl but
at a later stage.</p>
<p>I will be responsible for the
media and development of talent.pl.</p>
<p>The promotion of the whole
project – 8000 dollars.</p>
<p>All funds go the creation and
promotion of the project. I do not get any funds of this. I will be pleased to
answer all of your questions concerning funds.</p>
<p>Summary of things to do: </p>
<p>E-shop – sale of works </p>
<p>- The shop initially covering
plastic arts and all categories ultimately </p>
<p>Auctions </p>
<p>- On-line art auctions like an
auction house </p>
<p>- Mobile application </p>
<p>Portal development directions:
</p>
<p>- Improvement of the portal
graphic design + UX</p>
<p>- Commissions on agency
services in sales of works </p>
<p>- Opening the portal in
European markets </p>
<p>- Cooperation with art
galleries </p>
<p>Potential additional
directions </p>
<p>- Development of a sale
strategy of industrial products (posters, photo wallpaper, pictures, etc.)</p>
<p>- Establishment of a sales
team.</p>
<p>That would be fantastic to
enjoy artworks from all around the world, to share tem, to make possible for
artists to achieve their goals, to create new enormous things thank to you!</p>
<p>I estimate the costs of technical
and promotional portal expansion at 35000 dollars.</p>
<p>24000 dollars will be used for costs: servers, 1 marketing PR employee, 1 trader, technical support, graphic support, 1 social media expert, accountancy, talent.pl premises for 1 year (before it will generate income necessary to its further development).</p>
<p>Talent.pl needs a new
technical and promotional help to continue growing and be worldwide. Talent.pl
will collect people interested in the arts worldwide. Talent.pl wants to become
a multinational platform for artists and those who care about arts. Artists and
their fans will have their favourite social place where they can meet and
create! </p>
<p>If I will not achieve my fund
goal all given funds will be invested in talent.pl.</p>
<p>Concerning unique perks there
will be a hall of fame to thank you all, a unique type of account for life with
free self-promotion, consultation for every important banner, being every time
in the monthly newsletter, information about you on FB/talent.pl and your
activities.</p>
<p>I want you to become a patron
of the arts on and of talent.pl because it all happens thanks to you.</p>
<p>I am pleased to receive your
ideas about being all the time on talent.pl as a patron of the arts. Please
participate in giving you on talent.pl what you care about.</p>
<p>Concerning the concurrence
there is mainly pinterest.com, behance.net and deviantart.com but talent.pl is something
different, more specific so it has a special place on the net.</p><p>I do not offer many promotions on talent.pl because I don't want it to be a typic commercial portal, it must be interesting for its users. Please help me prepare the best artistic site ever :)</p><p>_____________________________________________________ </p><p>Polish version:</p><p></p><p><b>Czym jest talent.pl?</b></p>

<p>Talent.pl
na dzień dzisiejszy należy do najbardziej popularnych portali artystycznych w
Polsce.</p>
<p>Nad
talent.pl patronat medialny objęły w szczególności: TVP 1, TVP 2, TVP INFO, TVP
POLONIA, TVP WARSZAWA, Jedynka Polskie Radio, Radio dla Ciebie, ofeminin.pl,

<p><b>Koncepcja rozwoju
talent.pl:</b></p>
<p>Co chcę zrobić:</p>
<p>- na rozwój talent.pl na
dzień dzisiejszy wpływają dla mnie w szczególności 3 portale z różnych powodów:
pinterest.com (jest niezwykle prosty, intuicyjny i dostępny): łatwo się po nim
poruszać, jest szybki i nowoczesny; behance.net: bardzo stabilny, czytelny i
dość kompleksowy; deviantart.com: strona moim zdaniem taka sobie ale system
sprzedażowy prosty i rozbudowany,</p>
<p>- talent.pl powinien być
złożony z 4 części (potem można rozbudowywać dalej ale to jest podstawa): </p>
<p>1/
część wizualna/ viewerowa (skupienie się na dziele i artyście oraz jego
promocji),</p>
<p>2/
część społecznościowa (związana bezpośrednio z 1/): służąca do komunikacji z
użytkownikami i komunikacji użytkowników ze sobą (tu w zależności od
ostatecznie przyjętej koncepcji określimy szczegółowo co będzie dozwolone np.
kontaktowanie się pomiędzy użytkownikami w razie wprowadzenie handlu dziełami
sztuki/utworami),</p>
<p>3/crowdfunding
artystyczny: praktycznie nieistniejący w Polsce a bardzo poszukiwany,</p>
<p>4/
e-commerce: sprzedaż dzieł i teraz, zacząłbym od dzieł „obrazowych” (potem się
będzie e-commerce rozbudowywać o inne kategorie artystyczne, np. muzyka:
licencje, przeniesienie autorskich praw majątkowych) i na wzór deviantart.com
nie handlowałbym oryginałem (na pewno nie od razu) tylko kopią i dał z 3-4
opcje i 3 wielkości (np. mała, średnia, duża). Rozbudowałbym tu handel o
aplikację mobilną, w której można sobie telefon przyłożyć do ściany i wybrać
obraz/zdjęcie i układać je sobie na ścianie i wielkości ustalać (np. aplikacja
farb dulux).</p>
<p>Pokusiłbym
się o to by były poza polskim następujące wersje językowe: angielski,
francuski, rosyjski, niemiecki, hiszpański i chiński.</p>
<p>Co do źródeł dochodów
talent.pl: e-commerce, crowdfunding artysttyczny, kampanie reklamowe,

<p>Wiktor Czeszejko-Sochacki (talent.pl)</p><p></p></div>","Dear All,
I wish to get your interest in
an internet internet art project which already exists and has great development
prospects. Details are presented below. First I describe what talent.pl is and
this is followed by my proposal. Than you in advance for considering your
financial and technical support. It is a fantastic way of promoting art and
artists worldwide! It is a new idea of presenting arts – not by infos but by
introducing artists and their works, letting all to admire what can be done by
men and women from all the globe. Talent.pl is very wide considering all forms
of arts that can be seen there. Talent.pl logo is in polish and is a trademark
but exists for now also in English and French. I love art and I am certain that
for every one of us this project will make life more beautiful. 
Should you become interested,
I will present the further detailed steps. 
Your help will promote a way
of life more distinguish and more interesting.
Instead of funds I am looking
for every other way of promoting this project. I am looking for ideas,
technical help and promotion of talent.pl.
I am PhD and LL. M. of law at Paris
II Panthéon-Assas and advocate (graduated from the Warsaw University)
specialized in company and copyright laws. I work as a lawyer and I manage
talent.pl.

What is talent.pl?
Talent.pl is the
first internet social portal in Poland that provides an opportunity for
talented people in 13 artistic categories (music and singing; dance; film and
animation; acting; photography; painting, drawing, graphics; sculpture; artistic
handicraft; industrial design; poetry and prose; visage; architecture; modelling)
to present themselves to all internet users in the form of their audio, video
works, photographs or audio-video. Talent.pl includes over 50  sub-categories covering the above artistic
categories. Talent.pl includes as many as over 54,000 unique works by the
users! 
Talent.pl provides an opportunity
for private individuals and companies to view and search for talented people,
e.g. to hire them at a later time, to extend patronage above their talent in
various forms offered by the portal or just to admire their skills. Talent.pl
is addressed both at younger and more senior internet uses who look for
valuable forms of entertainment, who love various forms of art and who are keen
to support talented people and develop. The project is oriented on people who
are involved in art professionally or as amateurs, on art lovers and those who
look for values in life. 
The fanpage of talent.pl at
Facebook (facebook.com/talentpl) is very popular (almost 50 000 likes) with
differentiated content so that both young and more mature users can find something
for themselves.
The talentpl.tv site presents
all artworks published on talent.pl.
The English version of
talent.pl (talentpl.com, talent-world.com) and the French version
(lestalents.fr lestalents.com) attract foreign users to the portal. 
Right now, talent.pl is among
the most popular artistic portals in Poland.
Media patronage over talent.pl
has been extended e.g. by: TVP 1, TVP 2, TVP INFO, TVP POLONIA, TVP WARSZAWA,
Jedynka Polskie Radio, Radio dla Ciebie, ofeminin.pl, Warsaw School Film,
Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, Cracow
School of Art and Fashion Design, The Higher School of Art and
Design in Łódź, Deutsche Welle, Twoje Bielany biweekly, Extra Bemowo biweekly,
Vistula University and Mediateka in Warsaw.
Development concept of
talent.pl:
What I plan to do:
- the development of talent.pl
is now affected in particular three portals for different reasons:
pinterest.com (it is extremely simple, intuitive and accessible): it is easy to
navigate, it is fast and modern; behance.net: very stable, clear and quite
comprehensive; deviantart.com: nothing exciting about the site but the sales
system is simple and well developed,
- talent.pl should be composed
of four parts (it can be expanded afterwards but this will be the base): 
1/ visual part /
for viewing (focus on the work and artist and on artist promotion),
2/ social part
(directly related to 1/): for communication with users and communication among
users (subject to the finally approved concept, we will exactly define what
will be permitted, e.g. contacts among users should trade in works is
permitted) – 1/ and 2/ 17000 dollars, 
3/artistic
crowdfunding: practically non-existent in Poland but very much in demand – 5000 dollars,
4/ e-commerce: sale
of works – I would start with “image” works (to be followed by e-commerce in
other artistic categories, e.g. music: licences, transfer of economic
copyright) and similarly to deviantart.com I would not trade in originals (at
least not from the very beginning) but with copies – 3-4 options and 3 sizes
(e.g. small, medium, large). I would develop the trade with a mobile
application with which the phone can be approached to a wall to select a
picture/photograph and place them on a wall determining sizes (e.g. the
application of Dulux paints – you can change the colour of the wall and decide
about all details). If we decide to go ahead with that, I have a well skilled
person involved in e-commerce – 5000 dollars,
Apart from Polish,
I would also use the following language versions: English, French, Russian, Spanish
and Chinese.
Sources of revenues of
talent.pl: e-commerce, advertising campaigns, announcements (people looking for
specific artists to develop specific items), artistic patronage, golden
accounts (here I would combine all payable options (not all but selectively)
and make three options: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months). Additionally, I would
also think about an automatic option of advertising campaigns at talent.pl but
at a later stage.
I will be responsible for the
media and development of talent.pl.
The promotion of the whole
project – 8000 dollars.
All funds go the creation and
promotion of the project. I do not get any funds of this. I will be pleased to
answer all of your questions concerning funds.
Summary of things to do: 
E-shop – sale of works 
- The shop initially covering
plastic arts and all categories ultimately 
Auctions 
- On-line art auctions like an
auction house 
- Mobile application 
Portal development directions:

- Improvement of the portal
graphic design + UX
- Commissions on agency
services in sales of works 
- Opening the portal in
European markets 
- Cooperation with art
galleries 
Potential additional
directions 
- Development of a sale
strategy of industrial products (posters, photo wallpaper, pictures, etc.)
- Establishment of a sales
team.
That would be fantastic to
enjoy artworks from all around the world, to share tem, to make possible for
artists to achieve their goals, to create new enormous things thank to you!
I estimate the costs of technical
and promotional portal expansion at 35000 dollars.
24000 dollars will be used for costs: servers, 1 marketing PR employee, 1 trader, technical support, graphic support, 1 social media expert, accountancy, talent.pl premises for 1 year (before it will generate income necessary to its further development).
Talent.pl needs a new
technical and promotional help to continue growing and be worldwide. Talent.pl
will collect people interested in the arts worldwide. Talent.pl wants to become
a multinational platform for artists and those who care about arts. Artists and
their fans will have their favourite social place where they can meet and
create! 
If I will not achieve my fund
goal all given funds will be invested in talent.pl.
Concerning unique perks there
will be a hall of fame to thank you all, a unique type of account for life with
free self-promotion, consultation for every important banner, being every time
in the monthly newsletter, information about you on FB/talent.pl and your
activities.
I want you to become a patron
of the arts on and of talent.pl because it all happens thanks to you.
I am pleased to receive your
ideas about being all the time on talent.pl as a patron of the arts. Please
participate in giving you on talent.pl what you care about.
Concerning the concurrence
there is mainly pinterest.com, behance.net and deviantart.com but talent.pl is something
different, more specific so it has a special place on the net.I do not offer many promotions on talent.pl because I don't want it to be a typic commercial portal, it must be interesting for its users. Please help me prepare the best artistic site ever :)_____________________________________________________ Polish version:Czym jest talent.pl?
Talent.pl
to pierwszy w Polsce portal internetowy o charakterze społecznym umożliwiający
osobom utalentowanym w 13 określonych kategoriach artystycznych (muzyka i
śpiew; taniec; film i animacja; aktorstwo; fotografia; malarstwo, rysunek,
grafika; rzeźba; rzemiosło artystyczne; wzornictwo przemysłowe; poezja i proza;
wizaż; architektura; modeling) zaprezentowania się wszystkim użytkownikom
internetu, w postaci stworzonych przez siebie dzieł audio, wideo, zdjęć lub
audio-wideo. Talent.pl to ponad 50 podkategorii związanych z powyższymi
kategoriami artystycznymi. Talent.pl to już ponad 54.000 unikalnych dzieł
swoich użytkowników! 
Talent.pl
umożliwia zarówno osobom prywatnym jak i firmom przeglądanie i wyszukiwanie
utalentowanych osób np. w celu ich późniejszego zatrudnienia, objęcia w portalu
""Mecenatu"" nad ich talentem w różnych formach oferowanych przez
portal, lub też wyłącznie zachwycania się ich umiejętnościami. Talent.pl
skierowany jest zarówno do młodych jak i starszych internautów szukających
wartościowych form rozrywki, kochających różne formy sztuki oraz nastawionych
na wspieranie ludzi utalentowanych i rozwijanie się. Przedsięwzięcie kierowane
jest do ludzi zajmujących się sztuką profesjonalnie bądź amatorsko, dla
miłośników sztuki, oraz tych, którzy szukają wartości w życiu. 
Fanpage
talent.pl na facebooku (facebook.com/talentpl) cieszy się ogromnym
zainteresowaniem (prawie 50000 like’ów) i różnicuje treść, by i młodzi i
dojrzalsi użytkownicy znaleźli coś dla siebie.
Strona
talentpl.tv prezentuje wszystkie dzieła zamieszczane na talent.pl.
Wersja
angielska talent.pl (talentpl.com, talent-world.com) i francuska (lestalents.fr
lestalents.com) przysparza portalowi użytkowników zagranicznych. 
Talent.pl
na dzień dzisiejszy należy do najbardziej popularnych portali artystycznych w
Polsce.
Nad
talent.pl patronat medialny objęły w szczególności: TVP 1, TVP 2, TVP INFO, TVP
POLONIA, TVP WARSZAWA, Jedynka Polskie Radio, Radio dla Ciebie, ofeminin.pl,
Warszawska Szkoła Filmowa, ASP w Warszawie, Krakowskie Szkoły Artystyczne,
Wyższa Szkoła Sztuki i Projektowania w Łodzi, Deutsche Welle, dwutygodnik Twoje
Bielany,  dwutygodnik Extra Bemowo, Akademia Finansów i Biznesu, oraz
Mediateka w Warszawie.
Koncepcja rozwoju
talent.pl:
Co chcę zrobić:
- na rozwój talent.pl na
dzień dzisiejszy wpływają dla mnie w szczególności 3 portale z różnych powodów:
pinterest.com (jest niezwykle prosty, intuicyjny i dostępny): łatwo się po nim
poruszać, jest szybki i nowoczesny; behance.net: bardzo stabilny, czytelny i
dość kompleksowy; deviantart.com: strona moim zdaniem taka sobie ale system
sprzedażowy prosty i rozbudowany,
- talent.pl powinien być
złożony z 4 części (potem można rozbudowywać dalej ale to jest podstawa): 
1/
część wizualna/ viewerowa (skupienie się na dziele i artyście oraz jego
promocji),
2/
część społecznościowa (związana bezpośrednio z 1/): służąca do komunikacji z
użytkownikami i komunikacji użytkowników ze sobą (tu w zależności od
ostatecznie przyjętej koncepcji określimy szczegółowo co będzie dozwolone np.
kontaktowanie się pomiędzy użytkownikami w razie wprowadzenie handlu dziełami
sztuki/utworami),
3/crowdfunding
artystyczny: praktycznie nieistniejący w Polsce a bardzo poszukiwany,
4/
e-commerce: sprzedaż dzieł i teraz, zacząłbym od dzieł „obrazowych” (potem się
będzie e-commerce rozbudowywać o inne kategorie artystyczne, np. muzyka:
licencje, przeniesienie autorskich praw majątkowych) i na wzór deviantart.com
nie handlowałbym oryginałem (na pewno nie od razu) tylko kopią i dał z 3-4
opcje i 3 wielkości (np. mała, średnia, duża). Rozbudowałbym tu handel o
aplikację mobilną, w której można sobie telefon przyłożyć do ściany i wybrać
obraz/zdjęcie i układać je sobie na ścianie i wielkości ustalać (np. aplikacja
farb dulux).
Pokusiłbym
się o to by były poza polskim następujące wersje językowe: angielski,
francuski, rosyjski, niemiecki, hiszpański i chiński.
Co do źródeł dochodów
talent.pl: e-commerce, crowdfunding artysttyczny, kampanie reklamowe,
ogłoszenia (jak ktoś szuka konkretnego artysty do zrobienia określonej rzeczy)
i konta Premium Jak to wszystko by było pokusiłbym się o zrobienie
zautomatyzowanej opcji kampanii reklamowej na talent.pl.
Podsumowując co trzeba
zrobić:
- E-sklep - Sprzedaż dzieł- Sklep obejmujący w
pierwszym etapie prace plastyczne docelowo pozostałe kategorie
Aukcje:- Aukcje sztuki on-line na
zasadach domu aukcyjnego- Aplikacja mobilna
Kierunki rozwoju portalu:
- Poprawa projektu graficznego portalu + UX- Prowizyjność w
pośrednictwie sprzedaży dzieł- Uruchomienie portalu na rynkach europejskich- Współpraca z galeriami sztuki

My professional goal has been and still is the creation of gorgeous, comprehensive collections of art and game assets for anyone to use forever. I release my art under creative commons licenses or else into the public domain so there are few if any barriers to using them.<br/></p>
<p>Utilising the support of my <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/justinnichol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Patreon</a>, one of the collections I created was a set of cute fantasy character icons I called the <a href=""http://freeforall.cc/works/questquest-game-icons/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Questquest Icons</a>. I want to expand that collection and create a full catalog of heroes and creatures for game designers and enthusiasts of things fantasy and things cute. With your help, we could create the largest single collection of free fantasy characters and creatures.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I'd like to create a large enough collection of art to fully illustrate a card game under development called Questquest. But why should I have all the fun? Let's make free art for everyone to use!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>My<a href=""https://www.patreon.com/justinnichol"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Patreon</a> has allowed me to create a number of free art collections, but its structure tends to favor smaller sets of works. I usually create 
four to six of a given collection and then move on to another project to
 keep my patrons interested and try out new ideas and styles. The Questquest characters began as a Patreon project; a project which I 
loved so much that I painted more freebies than paid illustrations, 
bringing the total at this point up to fourteen monsters.<br/><br/>That's why I'm turning to indiegogo. My patreon is perfect for creating 
small packs of art in many styles, but with IGG I can dig deeper into individual collections. If the preliminary funding is obtained from this 
campaign, I can eschew freelance for the time necessary to <b>add an additional ten characters to the collection </b>(2 heroes, 5 monsters, and 3 boss monsters chosen by the backers). Additional funding could see our little
 horde of cuties grow to a truly impressive size. All the characters will be released under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 license, and will be made available as .pngs with transparent backgrounds, and will have include .kra or .xcf source files for editing the characters yourself. All new images will be 2000px by 2000px.<br/><br/>Backers will receive gifts for their contribution and will get to vote on which of three boss monsters are included in the collection. If the campaign is especially successful, additional boss monsters will reveal themselves. If they are defeated, they and five of their minions will be added to the collection. Also, wandering monsters will join the collection if certain goals are achieved to defeat them.<br/>
</div><div>
<ul>
<br/> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>A significant portion of the funding goes to supporting me while I take time away from freelance in order to paint all the characters. I'm guessing finishing the initial ten will take about a month. But another major portion of the funding will go into fulfilling the gifts and rewards due to backers of the campaign. So if the campaign is not fully funded, it is unlikely I will be able to fulfil physical rewards, though other rewards will be unaffected,<br/><br/>Apart from that, there are very few risks for this campaign, I love this collection and I would like to see it grow until there are dozens or hundreds of them. I am passionate about the project, and I do not foresee any difficulty in creating them or backer rewards should I achieve funding.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Wandering Monsters</h3>Wandering Monsters are new monsters that have joined the Horde. If they're here, they're included in the collection in addition to the primary goal. Defeat a wandering monster together and a new monster shall appear to join the horde! The Phrase of Power is #hordeofcuteness.<br/><br/><p></p>

I want to expand that collection and create a full catalog of heroes and creatures for game designers and enthusiasts of things fantasy and things cute. With your help, we could create the largest single collection of free fantasy characters and creatures.
Ultimately, I'd like to create a large enough collection of art to fully illustrate a card game under development called Questquest. But why should I have all the fun? Let's make free art for everyone to use!

  What We Need & What You Get My Patreon has allowed me to create a number of free art collections, but its structure tends to favor smaller sets of works. I usually create 
four to six of a given collection and then move on to another project to
 keep my patrons interested and try out new ideas and styles. The Questquest characters began as a Patreon project; a project which I 
loved so much that I painted more freebies than paid illustrations, 
bringing the total at this point up to fourteen monsters.That's why I'm turning to indiegogo. My patreon is perfect for creating 
small packs of art in many styles, but with IGG I can dig deeper into individual collections. If the preliminary funding is obtained from this 
campaign, I can eschew freelance for the time necessary to add an additional ten characters to the collection (2 heroes, 5 monsters, and 3 boss monsters chosen by the backers). Additional funding could see our little
 horde of cuties grow to a truly impressive size. All the characters will be released under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 license, and will be made available as .pngs with transparent backgrounds, and will have include .kra or .xcf source files for editing the characters yourself. All new images will be 2000px by 2000px.Backers will receive gifts for their contribution and will get to vote on which of three boss monsters are included in the collection. If the campaign is especially successful, additional boss monsters will reveal themselves. If they are defeated, they and five of their minions will be added to the collection. Also, wandering monsters will join the collection if certain goals are achieved to defeat them.


    Risks & ChallengesA significant portion of the funding goes to supporting me while I take time away from freelance in order to paint all the characters. I'm guessing finishing the initial ten will take about a month. But another major portion of the funding will go into fulfilling the gifts and rewards due to backers of the campaign. So if the campaign is not fully funded, it is unlikely I will be able to fulfil physical rewards, though other rewards will be unaffected,Apart from that, there are very few risks for this campaign, I love this collection and I would like to see it grow until there are dozens or hundreds of them. I am passionate about the project, and I do not foresee any difficulty in creating them or backer rewards should I achieve funding.
  Wandering MonstersWandering Monsters are new monsters that have joined the Horde. If they're here, they're included in the collection in addition to the primary goal. Defeat a wandering monster together and a new monster shall appear to join the horde! The Phrase of Power is #hordeofcuteness.


Huge shoutout to my Patreon patrons who funded the original icons:

</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>My name is
Elise Wagner and I have been part of the Portland, Oregon art community for 30
years. I work in the ancient medium of encaustic, the oldest known binder,
which combines beeswax, resin and pigment. Collagraph printing is a 20<sup>th </sup>century method in which a rigid printing plate is created using various
textured, stenciled “collage” materials such as beeswax, string, sandpaper, acrylic medium, textiles, bubble wrap or leaves (and almost anything else you can imagine) can all be used in creating a collagraph.  The plate is then inked and pressed on to
the paper with a rolling pin, or with the great force of an etching press.</p>
<p></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Back in 2003, while experimenting, I came up with a way to combine the two art forms by applying the texture of white encaustic paint (my very own brand... </span>eponymously named<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> ""Wagner Encaustic Collagraph White"") in place of collage material onto a plexiglas printing plate then
running it through a press and pulling a print from it. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The adherent and
moisture resistant properties common in encaustic, along with its overall
flexibility, make it an ideal printmaking material. </span></p>

developing this unique and fun technique, which has come to be known as

to states in the US as diverse as New York and Alabama to learn this exciting
technique and experience its many elements of surprise. </span></p>

</div></div>","What is Encaustic Collagraph? Check it out.
 

My name is
Elise Wagner and I have been part of the Portland, Oregon art community for 30
years. I work in the ancient medium of encaustic, the oldest known binder,
which combines beeswax, resin and pigment. Collagraph printing is a 20th century method in which a rigid printing plate is created using various
textured, stenciled “collage” materials such as beeswax, string, sandpaper, acrylic medium, textiles, bubble wrap or leaves (and almost anything else you can imagine) can all be used in creating a collagraph.  The plate is then inked and pressed on to
the paper with a rolling pin, or with the great force of an etching press.


Back in 2003, while experimenting, I came up with a way to combine the two art forms by applying the texture of white encaustic paint (my very own brand... eponymously named ""Wagner Encaustic Collagraph White"") in place of collage material onto a plexiglas printing plate then
running it through a press and pulling a print from it. 
The adherent and
moisture resistant properties common in encaustic, along with its overall
flexibility, make it an ideal printmaking material. 






Printing from the textures of my white pigmented wax with non-toxic soy and honey based Akua Intaglio inks makes the perfect marriage of materials!


Since
developing this unique and fun technique, which has come to be known as
Encaustic Collagraph, I have absolutely loved teaching, presenting and
demonstrating it to other artists. Artists have come to my Portland studio from
as far away as Tasmania, Holland, Singapore, Australia and Calgary in addition
to states in the US as diverse as New York and Alabama to learn this exciting
technique and experience its many elements of surprise. 



I have also been
invited and have taught at educational institutions and printmaking ateliers
throughout the U.S. and Canada from New York, to Alberta.



Over the years
since its development, Encaustic Collagraph, has been written about and
photographed in various books, blogs and articles crediting me for its creation, and bringing
more attention and interest to the technique. 




I continue teaching classes in my studio to
novices, printmakers and established artists – and my work is shown in galleries
in Seattle and Portland. It is also included in private and corporate
collections across the US. 



The SGCI (Southern Graphics Council International) Conference Flux: Portland will be my first major opportunity for
international exposure, and provides a uniquely multi-faceted opportunity to
share my printmaking process, as well as marketing handmade Wagner Encaustic Collagraph White paint
product, my class offerings, and my work as an artist.
        
Why I need your help

Survival Skills Needed

Choosing the life of an artist was not an easy one, but the twists and turns along the path have been rewarding to me in many ways. 
Over the years, with each risk I've taken, I have trusted and relied upon my instincts and abilities to be resourceful in overcoming every hurdle and breaking through to new understandings of my art and myself.
As a result, my means of survival has by necessity come to be a combination of three income streams: teaching workshops, being an Airbnb host (sometimes for my students traveling from far away places) and selling my artwork through annual exhibitions and the galleries that represent me.
Along the journey I have done everything I can think of, and have made many sacrifices, to continue my development as an artist. As a result of opening my once private studio and home to the public in an effort to stay financially afloat and survive as an artist, I found new opportunities continued to present themselves. 
I often wake up in the morning filled with new ideas for my art, and then develop ways of teaching others new techniques that incorporate those ideas. It's about sharing the love!  I have been happy to do so and have received only positive results and reactions.
Over the years, I have inspired others and garnered much support, advice and admiration for my survival skills from friends, colleagues, collectors and students. This has greatly helped and inspired me to stay on the path.
I have learned to be resourceful... bartering my artwork for studio upgrades, graphic design, art supplies, website optimization and even dental work; things that are necessary and often outside of my skill set or beyond my financial means. 
In setting out to solve the many challenges and hurdles involved with executing the SGCI: Flux Portland project, I intend to tap into my collection of recent artwork, to create a series of campaign perks for your enjoyment.

</div></div>","The RVA Street Art Festival is Back!
The 3rd edition of the RVA Street Art Fest is scheduled to take place at the Southern States Silos in Manchester April 22-24th!






The RVA Street Art Festival is locally run and dedicated to three outcomes:
  Raising money for arts education for kids
Finding and uncovering local artistic talent
Revitalizing blighted areas of the City to create new life and energy  This year, we are focusing on Bridging the River. As a part of the festival, we will be revitalizing a public park that is next to the silos (that few people know about) and partnering with Style Weekly on Earth Day (4/23) to offer two fantastic festivals for Richmond to enjoy.
The Festival will also feature:


An interpretive and active exhibit along the Slave Trail in front of the silos
Sculpture, steamroll printing, and other interactive exhibits
Painting with amazing local and national talent working side by side
The powerful images of photographer and Richmond native LeRoy Henderson
An artisan market, local food trucks, and Taste the Local craft beer
   What We Need & What You Get We are 85% of the way to full funding for the festival! We have partnered with local sponsors and donors, and need to secure the last bit of the funding to make the 2016 RVA Street Art Festival a reality!  The total cost of the Festival is $125,000. We need your help to raise the final $20,000 to make this thing happen!
Your funding will go to buying paint, securing lifts so artists can paint sky-high, and provide infrastructure for the festival.






 We have lots of sweet, sweet swag for you. Custom koozies, t-shirts, and event posters printed by RVA's Studio Two Three. You can also learn to paint murals with Ed Trask, drive a steamroller, get some VIP insider access, and permanently put your John Hancock on a Street Art Fest wall. Every dollar counts! We are all-volunteer run, and are committed to making this festival celebrate creativity in all its forms in our fantastic city! Your contribution supports Richmond, RVA artists and arts organizations, and supports youth art education.    The Impact  This is a festival for Richmond, by Richmond. We are working with local artists, organizations, and sponsors, and committed to showcasing the incredible talent in our city. Our first two Street Art Festivals (in 2012 and 2013) drew thousands of community members, raised thousands of dollars for local nonprofits, and brought new life to drab areas of the city. This year, we will transform an iconic part of the Richmond skyline, bring in performing artists, musicians, sculptors, and an artisan market, in addition to  beautiful murals.

  We have worked hard to plan the event and raise 85% of the funds. We need your support to make this epic event happen! Please donate to the 2016 RVA Street Art Festival!   Other Ways You Can Help Please share this campaign and help us get the word out! You can sign up to volunteer at event, as well - we need all hands on deck!

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>My name is Simone Bailey Campbell and I am a visual artist and designer. My husband, Kyle Campbell and I have an online company called Mahogany Blu Design. We create sculpted beeswax candles along with pen and ink sketches.</p>
<p>Why sculpted candles, you may ask? The events of 9/11 had a profound effect on me and I sought ways to soothe and uplift my spirit. Creating the candles signified the light that would and did rise from the ashes. For a long time, this was my personal way of healing from 9/11. However, it was my husband that encouraged me to share this form of healing and encouragement with the world.</p>
<p>Our candle designs are original. We sculpt our own models, make our own silicone molds and create a few of the fragrance blends. These unique candles burn clean because of the natural and eco-friendly ingredients of beeswax, palmwax, cotton wick, essential and fragrance oils and dyes (fragrance and dyes can be excluded upon request) . We currently have one design in our shop online, but your support during this campaign will help to complete the execution of the other 10 designs, five of which are on target for release this year.</p>
<p>The original sketch art is a recent addition to our online store. I began sketching last summer as a way to free my ""voice"". I choose pen and ink because of the need to commit to the line. Intuitively, the subject of the sketches are lips. I decided to post them on Instagram in order to get feedback. Moved by the response, we decided to give away the original small 3.5""x 5.5"" sketches straight out of sketch pad to the first person to comment. I believe there is nothing better than the feel of the original lines and texture made by the artist especially for you. To date we have given away just over 140 original sketches. This campaign will help with purchasing of supplies to meet the high volume of request to do sketches 36""and larger.</p>

<p>Inspired by Street Art and my love of prints, it only seemed natural to combine them. Hence, the birth of Urban Jungle. I like to think of it as a little grit with a little sweetness. Each candle and box is tagged (signed). Because each piece is hand painted, no two are exactly alike. In essence, you'll be receiving a one-of-a-kind!<br/><br/></p>
<p>The wax is our special blend of cleaned and filtered beeswax and palmwax. We use only natural cotton wick, essential oils and fragrances and eco-friendly dyes. Together they produce a clean burn.

<br/> </div></div>","Who We Are
My name is Simone Bailey Campbell and I am a visual artist and designer. My husband, Kyle Campbell and I have an online company called Mahogany Blu Design. We create sculpted beeswax candles along with pen and ink sketches.
Why sculpted candles, you may ask? The events of 9/11 had a profound effect on me and I sought ways to soothe and uplift my spirit. Creating the candles signified the light that would and did rise from the ashes. For a long time, this was my personal way of healing from 9/11. However, it was my husband that encouraged me to share this form of healing and encouragement with the world.
Our candle designs are original. We sculpt our own models, make our own silicone molds and create a few of the fragrance blends. These unique candles burn clean because of the natural and eco-friendly ingredients of beeswax, palmwax, cotton wick, essential and fragrance oils and dyes (fragrance and dyes can be excluded upon request) . We currently have one design in our shop online, but your support during this campaign will help to complete the execution of the other 10 designs, five of which are on target for release this year.
The original sketch art is a recent addition to our online store. I began sketching last summer as a way to free my ""voice"". I choose pen and ink because of the need to commit to the line. Intuitively, the subject of the sketches are lips. I decided to post them on Instagram in order to get feedback. Moved by the response, we decided to give away the original small 3.5""x 5.5"" sketches straight out of sketch pad to the first person to comment. I believe there is nothing better than the feel of the original lines and texture made by the artist especially for you. To date we have given away just over 140 original sketches. This campaign will help with purchasing of supplies to meet the high volume of request to do sketches 36""and larger.
What We Need:

We are asking for $5000. Here's the breakdown of the funds:



 Supplies for the production of new candle designs. These include: sculpting foam, silicone, casting plastic, beeswax and general candlemaking supplies

Supplies for the production of large scale sketches
Set up of independent website for one year on Squarespace
Production of your perks ;)
Indiegogo fees (4% if we meet our goals, 9% if we don't )
Credit card and Paypal fees (3%)
Taxes


Your Perks!
This is why your here! We put together an assortment of featured items from my collection for those interested in either artwork, candles, a mix of both, and custom artwork*. Hopefully one or some of these will catch your eye!

*Note regarding add-ons: Unfortunately, Indiegogo doesn't allow add-ons orcombining perks. You will have to make separate contributions for each perk you would like. So sorry about this inconvenience.

Special Edition - Zebra Candle Gift Set: $65

My name is Super-Mrin and I am an installation artist from New Delhi, India where I practiced architecture for several years before turning to art. 

I believe that our cities can be depressing and alienating experiences and I use public installations to transform them: to make our shared experiences more beautiful, interesting, playful and emotional. 


Here's what it's all About!
What you see is a giant public installation that we worked on over the last 4 years: today it has found a home temporarily at the magnificent Diego Gallery at the San Francisco Art Institute, a not-for-profit institution for the arts. The show goes live on the 6th of March, it is free and open to all. After this it will travel to other spaces across the city, and in the future, even to India.




It's so abstract! What does it Mean?

‘Willing’ is a suspended installation inspired by an essay on the nature of time in the Sanskrit epic the ‘Mahabharata’, a mythological/philosophical narrative on human nature. Using formal abstractions that evoke natural processes; the piece refers the body - its fragility, historicity and decay - to probe the notion of the will. 

The installation is a site - an interiority, an introspection, a meditation, a wonderment. It is reminiscent of the flow of water, corals, clouds and trees even the process of mitosis. Perhaps you see something completely unique in its forms. That is its beauty.

The installation, spread across a 20 x 30 ft dimly lit space, comprises 31 suspended acrylic pieces that narrate the journey of the body - the first or the ‘original’ mutates into the next, each piece developing unique personality, breaking apart in loops, illusions, mirages. Sound is used to extend relationships between space and audience; lights cast changing celebratory shadows across the floor and wall.

Come Join Me!

I need your help. This project is the first step in an art space collaborative titled 'Street Light' that I am building up. Lets work together to transform the spaces around us. Collaborate with me if you are passionate about art, support this project if you believe that things can change, and come by and volunteer your time if you are in the Bay Area.Some of you who know me (my friends across the world) may remember this image!! Please share and support the project so that we can finally build it up!!!

What We Need:

The first $3000 will be spent purchasing 20 sheets of acrylic, laser cutting the material to create the crazy forms that the installation entails, purchasing cables, hardware and building a suspension system from the gallery roof. I know, its a tall order with that much but we are hands on workers!
The next $1500 we raise will go into purchasing lights and sensors that will make the piece more interactive.

If we are able to raise more than this, we will start planning a travelling exhibition for the project.

And You Get Perks!

Each of you contributing anything more than $2 is connected to the project forevermore: your name will be credited every time the installation is on show anywhere. You made this happen and we will always remember that!!!
Check out the drawings and photographs we made during the process. To thank you for contributions over $15 we offer signed prints, postcards that will be mailed to you. Of course, your names will be up there too!This photograph of the installation was taken by the talented photographer Vishal Amler from India.These two drawings are titled 'The Landscape of the Brain', Ink on Paper.

For those of you contributing $100 or more, you will receive just about everything: signed prints from the show itself, USB drives with the videos of the actual event including an artist presentation.

The other fifty percent is directed to a U.S. based charitable organization chosen by the you at checkout!  The impact of your purchase not only affects the artists, your communities, and millions of people in the U.S.

</h3>
<h3>The Story!.!</h3>
<p>Peace Among Black Hills is a story of love, loss, and overcoming treacherous hardship and discrimination during the war with the Plains Indians of the North West. <br/>One Star and Jacob were born on opposite sides of the same coin, as “half breeds”. An early act of compassion brings them together as children, but the war raging around them tears them apart. In order to be together, they will have to overcome miles, and years of separation when One Star is taken to the Carlisle Institute in Pennsylvania. After years at the Institute, One Star and her best friend, Melody escape the Institute and return to the ranch of her love, Jacob, only to find him gone.  One Star and Melody decide to explore their world and leave love behind them when Jacob does not return to his childhood home. They experience the hardships of the land, and collect a band of other Misfit girls along the way. <br/>After realizing that none of them fit in with the civilization the world deems “Proper”, the girls make their way to a better life raising cattle in Montana. Along the way they encounter a series of unfortunate mishaps, the worst of which is the accidental death of the Silver City Sheriffs father in New Mexico, which One Star is blamed for. <br/>The girls begin a hasty escape north to San Francisco, where they meet up with an equally transient bunch of young men that agree to help them drive the cattle, and low and behold, one of the young men is the long lost love, Jacob. But the Silver City Sheriff is hot on their trail. <br/>Now that the group is complete, they must begin the treacherous journey north, through Oregon and Idaho, encountering every possible challenge the west has to offer along the way. They must try to reach Montana without being shot, trampled, captured by the Sheriff, or caught up by winter with 300 head of cattle in tow. <br/>Its “Young Guns” meets “Dances with Wolves” with the perfect mix of true history and make believe, shining light on the amazing and gritty history of the Pacific Northwest. <br/></p>
<h3>We are Planted Roots!:</h3>
<p>We often get caught up in the belief that local or independent films 
cant be as high quality or moving as big mainstream films.. Fortunately,
 this isn't true.. <br/> Why are independent films so important? Because 
they aren't just a story, they are art! They are a stepping stone for 
up-and-coming talent! They bring revenue to locations like our small town of Sandpoint, ID! 
They create a job source! They teach a new generation about film! There 
are so many reasons why independent films are important! <br/></p>
<p>Filmmakers do not have a moral obligation to create socially 
conscious, empathy-inducing films, but films have the ability to to 
shine light on social issues, help comfort personal struggles, and help 
motivate great love and compassion for humanity. <br/></p>
<p> Planted Roots Productions was founded by two small town sisters, Sarah 
and Hailey Hines in August 2015, with a goal of bringing artful, 
motivating movies back to the film community. <br/></p>
<p>Our
 crew is dedicated to bringing high quality short and feature films that
 touch their audience, and we want to do it locally!  We want to bring 
business to our beautiful town, while telling amazing stories.. Where do
 the sponsors funds go? Costumes, props, set dressing, location fee's, 
film permits, gas, equipment, and food.. <br/> Do you want to help 
sponsor an amazing local film, with talented local cast and crew? And 
get onscreen film credit for it? Here's your chance!<br/></p>
<p>Why is this campaign important? <br/>Because our story is important! Yes, its an action packed, gritty, scenic western film. But it is also a love story that uplifts and empowers the audience and shines light on major historic events that are often downplayed or forgotten. Oh and not to mention, the butt kicking is done by a group of girls!<br/></p>
<p>Why choose our project over so many others? <br/> Well that is completely up to you! But if it was me, I would back this project... We have already funded $2,000 of this project ourselves, because we are 
passionate about it and believe so strongly in its success! Everyone needs a good western in their lives, right? But its not just our amazing story that your supporting, its our amazing cast and crew who are all donating their time and energy to this project because they believe in it, too! If so many people are willing to volunteer their time to making this happen, it couldn't be that bad, right?</p>
<p>Where will your donation go? <br/>Your donation goes to paying for Equipment Fee's, Location Fee's, Gasoline, Lodging, Costumes, and Food. We have the amazing people, now we just need help funding the other key parts of making a great film. Every little bit helps! <br/></p>

So I wrote a script for a short film and came up with this crazy idea that everyone on screen would be trans-identified. I figured, how many movies have I seen in my life with an all cisgender (non-trans) cast...why not try something a little different? Why not show everyone who views this film the multiplicity of ways in which trans people can look, talk, and move about in the world? <br/></p><p>Since there is no one singular trans experience why would I pigeonhole myself by creating a short film that fits neatly into an 'LGBT genre?' The LGBTQ experience is as vast and diverse as any other community and why can't we mesh different genres in unexpected ways to create something new and exciting? </p><p>So I'm asking you to help us produce a short film with an <b>all transgender cast </b>and create visible representations of a community that is as diverse as it is beautiful.</p><p>We are currently in pre-production.

So I wrote a script for a short film and came up with this crazy idea that everyone on screen would be trans-identified. I figured, how many movies have I seen in my life with an all cisgender (non-trans) cast...why not try something a little different? Why not show everyone who views this film the multiplicity of ways in which trans people can look, talk, and move about in the world? Since there is no one singular trans experience why would I pigeonhole myself by creating a short film that fits neatly into an 'LGBT genre?' The LGBTQ experience is as vast and diverse as any other community and why can't we mesh different genres in unexpected ways to create something new and exciting? So I'm asking you to help us produce a short film with an all transgender cast and create visible representations of a community that is as diverse as it is beautiful.We are currently in pre-production.

I'd love you to join in my cause and passion. For over 15 years now I have been involved with working to raise the prominence of a group of 1950s era African-American landscape artists known as the Florida Highwaymen. These 26 Artists (25 men and 1 woman) are critically and culturally acclaimed in Florida, but sadly unknown elsewhere. Their creativity has lasted up to the present day, with over 250,000 paintings created. The Florida Highwaymen began painting during a time of racial intolerance, segregation and prejudice. They not only created stunningly vibrant landscape art, but they also forged their own Civil Rights story. Their art was their vehicle to express their rights, freedoms and self-esteem. Please help to support or attend a Black History Month Exhibit celebrating the story, the era and the works of the Florida Highwaymen. The only ""Highwaywoman"" artist, Mary Ann Carroll, 77, will be in attendance. The Florida Highwaymen Art Exhibit in Toronto is the 4th and last in a series of highly acclaimed Highwaymen Exhibits in Canada. Please lend your support to make this important event happen! Thank you.</p><h3>The History and Importance of the Florida Highwaymen:</h3><p><strong>African Americans Who Created Vibrant Landscape Art and a Poignant Civil Rights Story </strong></p><p>“Art has an ability to soften difficult exchanges… exchanges in social, political and human difference.

Their careers took shape during a time and in a place where pursuing a career as an artist presented an alternative to working in citrus groves and labour camps. Denied access to private galleries due to segregation, the Highwaymen made a living selling their work door to door and from their cars along Florida’s eastern coastal roads A1A and US 1.

In so doing they became a living example of the American Dream and gifted America with an incredible collection of breathtaking dreamlike landscapes depicting a lost primordial paradise that was Florida before the shovels and the concrete of development  that would change it forever. They are the Florida Highwaymen, African American Landscape artists from the 50s, and their untold American Saga of beauty and freedom. </i>""</p><p>The Highwaymen first began painting Florida Landscapes in 1954. America was struggling to put a rocket into space, the national highway system was still two years away and Florida was a very young and undeveloped state. Racism, prejudice and harsh Jim Crow segregationist laws meant that African Americans were treated as second class citizens. Opportunities were few, and higher education and advancement were denied to most. Life offered hard menial work in hot agriculture fields. African Americans were  subjected to hatred, racism, segregation and violence. That year, the Civil Rights Movement in the south was just beginning.</p><p>Emerging against this backdrop, in the small east coast town of Fort Pierce, was a group of young African American landscape artists. Several of them had had some formal art training in High School, but most were self taught. They mentored each other and honed their skills. They developed ingenious ""fast"" painting techniques to increase productivity. Improvising to save costs, they used construction materials, ""upson"" wallboard for their ""canvas"" and window casing for frames.</p><p>Racism and prejudice closed the doors of art galleries as none would represent African American artists, that was the domain of white artists only. So they improvised to make their sales. They visited businesses, offices and homes to sell their art door to door and out of the trunks of their vehicles. Often these works were freshly painted and still wet. They took to the roads and the highways. In 1995, white art historian Jim Fitch began to research stories of a group of African American artists painting landscapes in the Fort Pierce area. He named the group, branding them the ""Highwaymen."" Astonishingly, it took 40 years after they had begun painting for them to become recognized as an art group! </p><p>In 2004, the State of Florida inducted all 26 Highwaymen painters into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame, along with the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Ray Charles and Tennessee Williams. Estimates are that they created 250,000 to 400,000 works of art! Many of the surviving artists are still painting for a living.  Two generations of Highwaymen offspring and countless others now paint “in their style”. They continue to defy categorization and time. Respect is slow to come, yet with such a huge body of work over more than half a century of time they meet all the criteria of an art movement. In fact, it has been said that the Florida Highwaymen are the most significant American Art Movement of the last half of the 20th Century. Yet sadly, these artists have not yet been fully recognized for who they are or what they did.  Few outside the state of Florida have heard of them. Only recently has their epic saga been recognized as a unique but untold Civil Rights Story.</p><p>Their legacy is a massive body of work that captures a dreamlike primordial Florida landscape dominated by pristine wetlands, fecund forests and splendorous skies. It is a Florida that no longer exists, lost to development, tourism, and concrete. However, their artwork stands through time as a statement of environmental protection, self determination and human rights.</p><h3>The Passion:</h3><p>My adventures began with the Florida Highwaymen in 2001, while searching for some iconic Florida art, I found a painting online that reached out to me, it was a sun-drenched sandy beach, with crashing surf, tall billowing clouds, wafting palms and soaring  birds. I thought, that’s exactly what I was looking for. It said “Florida Highwaymen” so I began to research the painting's history and became ""instantly hooked"" on the story of this group of African American painters from Fort Pierce, Fla., who had defied social convention to sell their art as an alternative to working in Florida's citrus groves. I thought ""This is like the Group of Seven in Canada but instead of seven white guys mentoring each other and painting the wilds of Canada, this is 26 black artists mentoring each other and painting the wilds of Florida. I was hooked!</p><p>The commonality to the Group of 7 intrigued me, and the art was fascinating. The story was romantic, poignant and inspiring,  Over time I ended up with a significant collection of Highwaymen paintings. But I needed to ask myself  what was I, as a Canadian, doing with all of this American art? I had lent it to many exhibits in Florida but I was living in Canada and had no intention of bringing the art north. I considered it an important part of American History and Culture. It really made no sense to have this collection sitting in storage. That to me was wrong, the art and the story needed to be shared. It needed to be on exhibit. I felt that underlying this  was also an untold Civil Rights. The story that needed to be told outside of Florida. The artists were getting older and dying off. I felt their story needed to be told by the artists while they were still alive. I took up the cause to get involved and share the art and help get these artists known and appreciated outside of Florida.</p><p>I chose to move my collection to Washington, I felt that was as a good as place as any to raise the group’s awareness. There I found an ally at Florida House, an embassy on Capital Hill, for a state instead of a country. They agreed to showcase my Highwaymen artwork. Since then I have spent the last decade trying to exhibit the  collection in the United States. Being out of the country has not helped. I had limited success in spreading the word. As an ""unconnected"" Canadian living north of the border I was having a difficult and challenging time ""shedding light on this part of American History and Culture"".</p><p><br/> I had  just about given up on my quest, and then one day last year the U.S. Embassy in Canada became aware of my collection and my efforts, and agreed to bring the paintings to Canada. In 2016, under the auspices of Vicki Heyman,  the wife of Bruce Heyman, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, the art crossed the border north into Canada. Mrs. Heyman, was a keen supporter of the arts and facilitated cross-border artistic exchanges while she was in Canada. She says ""the Highwaymen's story addresses issues such as social justice, race, environment and identity."" She believes the paintings constitute an art movement, although ""not the kind of art movement the art society would necessarily accept."" The U.S, Embassy helped to mount 3  exhibits in Ottawa, Montreal and Windsor, which all received rave reviews and critical acclaim.</p><p>The Highwaymen art in this exhibit will be departing Canada this year as it heads back to the U.S. It had arrived in Canada as part of a cultural mission for the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa, and the Montreal U.S. Consulate. The Windsor exhibit and now the upcoming Toronto exhibit have been self funded. The upcoming Toronto Black History Month exhibit will be important, being that it is in Canada's cultural centre, but also extra special, as famed Highwaywoman artist Mary Ann Carroll will be present for the exhibit's opening night events. She will be flying in specially from Florida to attend the festivities, share her stories and meet with exhibit attendees. The exhibit will be at Daniels Spectrum at 585 Dundas Street East in the Regent Park neighbourhood.</p><h3>What is Needed:</h3><p>The campaign to fund the exhibit has set a monetary goal of $3,500 CDN. The actual estimate to mount the exhibit is $5000 to $6000, so we are looking to fund just over half of that amount through INDIEGOGO. The big thanks go to all of you for helping  and with thanks to all of you.</p><p><strong>Major costs include</strong>: Start up costs, advertising, printing and media outreach. Shipping the art to Toronto from Ottawa. Installing the art. Signage for the art. Opening night Vernissage , space, food, drinks. Return flight from Florida for Mary Ann Carroll (77) who needs to be accompanied by her daughter, as her health is not the best. Hotel, transport, food etc. for Mary Ann Carrol and her daughter while in Toronto.</p><p>I have attempted to allow for as many levels of support as is possible. A shared experience enhances the exhibit and speaks to the soul of the art and sharing not only it but also the story with as many people as possible.  The sense being that the more we can have involvement the greater the team. In the end the Exhibit and your support is about acknowledging the art and the fascinating efforts and the history of an extremely important, but unknown group of artists that did amazing things during a dark period of American History.</p><h3>Great Perks For You!:</h3><p>It's crowd funding and it's for art, I believe it's all about <strong>sharing.</strong> I'm trying to share this great art and this great story, I'd like you to share a little $ to  help me be able to do that. With that in mind there are a number of<strong> Kool Perks</strong> for you, after all The Florida Highwaymen is a very cool story and their art is also superb. Please join the<strong> team</strong> and partake in an important social event and <strong>help make this exhibit happen!</strong></p><p>The $2 Team Perk, which is our ask to you to get involved at minimal cost. If we get 1000 people involved, at just a little money, this exhibit gets well on its' way to happening and I send you a <strong>Big Thanks!</strong></p><p>There's also a $5 Perk which is My True Thanks &amp; A Big Hug!</p><p>Next is a $5 Highwaymen Poster from the Windsor Highwaymen Exhibit.</p><p>For $10 You Have an invite to the Opening Night Reception of the Exhibit at Daniels Spectrum  in Toronto on February 09/2017.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","The Cause:I'm Tony Hayton from Ottawa, Canada.

The exhibit will be at Daniels Spectrum at 585 Dundas Street East in the Regent Park neighbourhood.What is Needed:The campaign to fund the exhibit has set a monetary goal of $3,500 CDN. The actual estimate to mount the exhibit is $5000 to $6000, so we are looking to fund just over half of that amount through INDIEGOGO. The big thanks go to all of you for helping  and with thanks to all of you.Major costs include: Start up costs, advertising, printing and media outreach. Shipping the art to Toronto from Ottawa. Installing the art. Signage for the art. Opening night Vernissage , space, food, drinks. Return flight from Florida for Mary Ann Carroll (77) who needs to be accompanied by her daughter, as her health is not the best. Hotel, transport, food etc. for Mary Ann Carrol and her daughter while in Toronto.I have attempted to allow for as many levels of support as is possible. A shared experience enhances the exhibit and speaks to the soul of the art and sharing not only it but also the story with as many people as possible.  The sense being that the more we can have involvement the greater the team. In the end the Exhibit and your support is about acknowledging the art and the fascinating efforts and the history of an extremely important, but unknown group of artists that did amazing things during a dark period of American History.Great Perks For You!:It's crowd funding and it's for art, I believe it's all about sharing. I'm trying to share this great art and this great story, I'd like you to share a little $ to  help me be able to do that. With that in mind there are a number of Kool Perks for you, after all The Florida Highwaymen is a very cool story and their art is also superb. Please join the team and partake in an important social event and help make this exhibit happen!The $2 Team Perk, which is our ask to you to get involved at minimal cost. If we get 1000 people involved, at just a little money, this exhibit gets well on its' way to happening and I send you a Big Thanks!There's also a $5 Perk which is My True Thanks & A Big Hug!Next is a $5 Highwaymen Poster from the Windsor Highwaymen Exhibit.For $10 You Have an invite to the Opening Night Reception of the Exhibit at Daniels Spectrum  in Toronto on February 09/2017.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About this project</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Bill Czappa and I am an artist working with found objects. I have been making sculptures since the '60s. The project I want to finish is this piece I call “Abstract Erectorism.”  I started this piece some 20 years ago and want to use this platform to finish it. I need some $1795.00 to finish it up. My small business used to support my work but it is not doing so well these days so I really need your help to finish it. This is not the largest Erector set piece ever made but possibly one of the most interesting.  Seeing this piece in operation takes people back to their childhood and some holiday morning. So this piece needs to be completed and gotten out for the public to see and enjoy.</p>
<p>The piece itself is made from Erector set pieces. Erector sets are still made but the older ones are the best. You can build just about anything with this toy. In fact, it was designed to be an educational toy. I purchased 13 kits from an antique store that was moving and that was the impetus to make this piece. Since then I have had to purchase even more parts and motors from  Ebay. There are 8 different motors that move 8 different functions, each containing numerous moving parts. There will be lights in various places and in the little house you can peek in the window and see me in my studio building this very piece.</p>
<p>What needs to be done? All of the various elements have to be removed and re-installed on a new plywood backing. Some of the pieces will need to be sent out to be re-tinned.  I need to have a rack fabricated so it can be mounted on a wall, much like a mount for a flat screen TV. However, it will have to be made of aluminum in order to keep the weight down. Once that is made the various elements have to be re-installed and they have to be rewired and all the lights hooked up.</p>
<p>Then the complicated frame has to be made from several different pieces of moulding and it has to be made to attach to the piece after it is mounted on the wall, again in order to keep the weight down. </p>
<p>So with your help I can finally finish it. I am offering some interesting rewards from a video of the piece being taken apart and re-built to a personal-guided tour of my studio followed by a burger, chili and kraut dog meal including beverage.</p>
<p>My budget is at the end of this.  If I get more then the amount requested I can miss some days at work and finish it even sooner.</p>
<p>Thanks for having a look, and to find out more about me have a look at my website and some documentary shorts that have been made about me and my work, including one on Vimeo featuring this very piece.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Some of the obstacles that could come up is finishing it in the allotted time. Although the plans have already been drawn up, there is no way to accurately tell how long it might take given having to make some of the rewards as well. I have to work and only have half day Saturdays and all day Sundays to work on the piece and a few days after work. But once I get rolling on a piece I have a track record of getting them done as can be seen on some other major works I have made such as ""The Spruce Goose ll"" that took some 500 hours to build. <br/>The other problem could be summer heat as my studio is not air-conditioned.</p>

Hi, my name is Bill Czappa and I am an artist working with found objects. I have been making sculptures since the '60s. The project I want to finish is this piece I call “Abstract Erectorism.”  I started this piece some 20 years ago and want to use this platform to finish it. I need some $1795.00 to finish it up. My small business used to support my work but it is not doing so well these days so I really need your help to finish it. This is not the largest Erector set piece ever made but possibly one of the most interesting.  Seeing this piece in operation takes people back to their childhood and some holiday morning. So this piece needs to be completed and gotten out for the public to see and enjoy.
The piece itself is made from Erector set pieces. Erector sets are still made but the older ones are the best. You can build just about anything with this toy.

Then the complicated frame has to be made from several different pieces of moulding and it has to be made to attach to the piece after it is mounted on the wall, again in order to keep the weight down. 
So with your help I can finally finish it. I am offering some interesting rewards from a video of the piece being taken apart and re-built to a personal-guided tour of my studio followed by a burger, chili and kraut dog meal including beverage.
My budget is at the end of this.  If I get more then the amount requested I can miss some days at work and finish it even sooner.
Thanks for having a look, and to find out more about me have a look at my website and some documentary shorts that have been made about me and my work, including one on Vimeo featuring this very piece.

Risks and challenges
Some of the obstacles that could come up is finishing it in the allotted time. Although the plans have already been drawn up, there is no way to accurately tell how long it might take given having to make some of the rewards as well. I have to work and only have half day Saturdays and all day Sundays to work on the piece and a few days after work. But once I get rolling on a piece I have a track record of getting them done as can be seen on some other major works I have made such as ""The Spruce Goose ll"" that took some 500 hours to build. The other problem could be summer heat as my studio is not air-conditioned.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

We will do whatever it takes to make this another successful project. Since the project majorly depends on the fundraising to purchase the materials, we need your help to close this gap and make it happen! In this way, you can literally participate in the art creation and be a part of our crew. Thank You!!!Special Thanks for helping with the creation of this campaign:- FlyHelo- MediaFervor- The main photo is by The Blissful Idiot",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

For my 16th birthday, I received my first Tarot deck, a Rider Waite deck. I still use that same deck today although my Tarot deck collection has grown by leaps and bounds.</p><p>I love that the tradition of Tarot reaches back hundreds of years. My grandmother and my great- grandmother were both Tarot readers and spell casters. I love that this tradition called to me and to my own daughter. I love this chain stretching back into the mists of time and forward into the uncharted future.</p><p>As an artist and Tarot enthusiast, I've spent a lot of time thinking about purpose and meaning. I began my career in art as a means of working through my own traumas and demons but soon realized that my struggle resonated with many people. My art resonated and kept me on my current path. I realized that my search for meaning was so much simpler than I'd ever dreamed.</p><p>The same message conveyed in dozens of different ways and in an infinite number of voices. We are made of star stuff. We are eternal. We are valued. We are worthy of love. </p><p>I started working on a Tarot deck a few years back and my Tarot art resonated deeply with more people than I expected. I made the completion of the artwork for the deck my primary art project in 2019, creating one new card every week.</p><p>I was inspired by the iconic artwork of the Rider Waite deck, creating unique imagery for all 78 cards. Pictured on the left are the images for the New Orleans Tarot Cats and on the right are photos of my thirty year old Rider Waite deck.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600784416/jtp2s9qmcz0zt8j28tzp.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600794034/coi2hjhmhemfm85tgldy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600794073/c6vr0gaogkpczlptmcx5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>When I began this journey, crafting a card a week, I was moved by the encouragement and enthusiasm I received.

We moved a lot as a family when I was a child and I never really felt like I had roots anywhere. Then I met New Orleans. I fell in love with the architecture, the food, the music, the art, and the unbelievable sprawl of the live oak trees. </p><p>I'd never seen anything like them. My previous experience was with palm trees and birches and cedar. The live oak is a universe unto itself. The roots go deep. At last I felt a sense of belonging.

For my 16th birthday, I received my first Tarot deck, a Rider Waite deck. I still use that same deck today although my Tarot deck collection has grown by leaps and bounds.I love that the tradition of Tarot reaches back hundreds of years. My grandmother and my great- grandmother were both Tarot readers and spell casters. I love that this tradition called to me and to my own daughter. I love this chain stretching back into the mists of time and forward into the uncharted future.As an artist and Tarot enthusiast, I've spent a lot of time thinking about purpose and meaning. I began my career in art as a means of working through my own traumas and demons but soon realized that my struggle resonated with many people. My art resonated and kept me on my current path. I realized that my search for meaning was so much simpler than I'd ever dreamed.The same message conveyed in dozens of different ways and in an infinite number of voices. We are made of star stuff. We are eternal. We are valued. We are worthy of love. I started working on a Tarot deck a few years back and my Tarot art resonated deeply with more people than I expected. I made the completion of the artwork for the deck my primary art project in 2019, creating one new card every week.I was inspired by the iconic artwork of the Rider Waite deck, creating unique imagery for all 78 cards. Pictured on the left are the images for the New Orleans Tarot Cats and on the right are photos of my thirty year old Rider Waite deck.When I began this journey, crafting a card a week, I was moved by the encouragement and enthusiasm I received. I don't know if I would have gotten here without the support of my friends and my tribe. Thank you all so much. Your support has meant the world to me..My first great love was the city of New Orleans. We moved a lot as a family when I was a child and I never really felt like I had roots anywhere. Then I met New Orleans. I fell in love with the architecture, the food, the music, the art, and the unbelievable sprawl of the live oak trees. I'd never seen anything like them. My previous experience was with palm trees and birches and cedar. The live oak is a universe unto itself. The roots go deep. At last I felt a sense of belonging. I'd come home.The Artwork I've used a variety of art techniques in creating my deck. I started with my own photography of local places: Jackson Square, Audubon Park, City Park, local cemeteries, St Louis Cathedral, the Moon Walk, and many more. I worked with the photographs digitally, collaging in other aspects and using digital brushes and filters until I got the art to look exactly the way that I wanted.I've opted to have the deck printed on linen cardstock. The linen ""texture adds ridges that reduce surface contact between cards, making them easier to shuffle, deal and handle.""I worked to create a true mirror of the traditions of the Tarot.The Major Arcana tells the story of the journey of the Fool as they learn important lessons and ascend to a higher level of understanding, spiraling up to the World.The Minor Arcana reflect the eternal truths of the four elements.- The Wands (representing Fire) bring us ferocity and passion. - The Cups (representing Water) remind us of the importance of love, emotion, creativity and intuition.- The Swords (representing Air) cut through the distracting noise of our every day lives with logic and intellect leading the way.- The Pentacles bring us back to Earth, enforcing the importance of nurturing love and the material world.What We Need & What You GetThe funding I am trying to raise covers the costs of printing my artwork on linen cardstock, creating the boxes and getting the boxes shrink wrapped so the recipient knows it's a brand new for them Tarot deck. Cards are the traditional Tarot size 2.75 inches by 4.75 inches.If you would like to support this project, you can get the perks as described: artwork, cards or even a Tarot bag of holding in velvet.Risks & ChallengesMy deck is completed: all 78 images created over the course of a year and half. I have already ordered the decks. They are currently in production and will be arriving to me by the end of this campaign.Each full deck will come with its own shrink wrapped tuck box, ready for you to unwrap it and feel the mystical promise in your own hands.This is actually my second Indiegogo project. My previous campaign, The Animal Spirits of the Apocalypse received full funding between the campaign here on Indiegogo and a fundraiser on Facebook. Everyone that ordered the Animal Spirits deck has received their pre order.The New Orleans Tarot Cats deck is already being printed. You will receive your order. The Tarot Bags of Holding are made and ready to be shipped.I've been a professional artist for many years and I intend to continue on this path for as many years as I can.Other Ways You Can HelpI understand that not everyone can afford to financially support my campaign, but I would be deeply grateful if you could share my campaign with the world.Share my campaign on Facebook or Instagram or Twitter.Tell your spiritually inclined friends.

<h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
<p>FARM is a brand created for those of us who stand apart without effort. The doers and the thinkers with innate traits that drive us to pursue greater truths and wellness for themselves and the world of which we live.</p>
<p>We are artists, humans that pursue and share the deepest depths of creativity for all to see. We are the athletes, those who choose to chase the pain and sacrifice required to reach beyond our own physical and mental limits. We are the craftsmen that never stop making, the students who seek to never stop learning. We are sons and daughters of those who have lived before us, a generation of dreamers and fighters that endured countless adversities and hardships in order to provide us with a brighter future we enjoy today. We are forever grateful, we will never forget, and we carry your spirits, grit and unwavering enthusiasm as we continue to fight the good fight for a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>We are different, together. We <i>are </i>one another. FARM represents our united voices and our individual stories.</p>

<p><strong>Comfortable</strong> - There is ‘comfort over beauty’, but what about being both? Our product team sources only the best materials and fit that in themselves define the essence of comfort while always looking incredible. There is nothing in our own curated collection that we do not absolutely love to wear.  </p>

We focus on ethics, sustainability, and creating clothing that is always manufactured and sourced responsibly.

<div>I designed this installation to draw attention to the many ways we limit our self identities and therefor our life potential. Identity Reorganization Portal is designed to be a gauntlet thrown down before the apparent solidity of the assumed ""I"".   Our mirrored transport system will visually suggest new identity options for viewers/participants/Black Rock Citizens as they find their reflections  multiplied, fractalized and rearranged to include others in the near vicinity. <br/>Simultaneously our portal will supply  a  continuos looping sound collage suggesting new and different self perceptions.<br/>Acolytes will take a moment to view their reflections while listening to and considering the identity suggestions shared in our sound collage.  Then when they press the lighted button within the portal the sound collage will fade and an audio oracle emerges with exactly the piece of information needed to step into the new moment.</div>
We received a grant from BurningMan to begin this process. However to complete the project to its potential we are seeking a small crowd fund for assistance.<br/>With your help we will purchase a large solar panel, charge controller. Solar Battery, speakers, amplifier and all the electrical components to bring our sound system to life. Your assistance will also help us to pay for transport of the portal to the Black Rock Playa. Likewise We are seeking assistance in paying the bills we have accrued building our portal thus far.</div><div>As a thank you for your assistance we will be offering a variety of perks including stickers, T-shirts, Pendents, original Ceramic tiles, platters and sculptures.

<div>I have built thus far 10 installations for the BurningMan festival. Four of these installations received funding assistance from the BurningMan organization. I have also received crowd funding assistance for three of these projects.</div>

<h3>I'm Carson Barnes, master printmaker.</h3>
<p>The past weighs on me more and more; its physical evidence moves me - ruins, relics, statuary in cemeteries.  The motherlode of funerary statuary is in Genoa, Italy; last year's campaign got me to several cemeteries in Germany and France.  The resulting new work has been shown a couple of times in New York, in Georgia and North Carolina this year; not only is the work being noticed, it's getting better.</p>
<p>The statuary is of women mainly; those of men of the period (mostly 1700s - early 1900s) don't show much emotion.  These women have been forgotten, they were real people, with concerns and feelings like ours.  Research often reveals who they were, their names, their calamities and joys; this helps me bring out their character.  They are my muses; my muses are of stone.</p>
<p><strong>Cost breakdown</strong></p>
<p>I was surprised to see that ink alone cost $2,178.00 over the past year - I'd budgeted less than half that.  Paper for a full edition runs $300 per edition of 50 prints, though with digital technology it's  no longer necessary to run off all 50 at once (not as it was with silkscreen printing, which I loved and in which I hold the Master's in Fine Arts, but which destroyed my wrists after 35 years). Other costs are airfare (Turkish Air runs the cheapest flights), and Air BnB which is the cost effective means of finding a room.  I'll fly to Milan and take the train to Genoa.  It appears to me that $7,500 will get the imagery needed for the next year's work.  I insist on making the prints here, when I'm done working the composition, color, light, textures.  It's imperative to make these images.  These women deserve remembrance.</p>
<p><strong>What do you get out of it?</strong></p>
<p>The work of the past two years is online at carsonbarnesart.com ; longer essays on most pieces are on my page on Facebook, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Carson-Barnes-Fine-Prints-251339921579077/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/Carson-Barnes-Fine-Pri...</a> .  For this campaign, I'm offering a selection of ten pieces at 40% discount:  those that sold at $500 are temporarily $300, the $250 portrait pieces are $150, the intimate pieces regularly priced at $125 are $75. There are also two of the large pieces, 26 x 39 inches, at $600 for the month instead of $1000.  Pricing is simple, it's by size, as twice the area takes twice the work, twice the ink and twice the cost of paper (Rives BFK printmaking paper, made in France since the 1500s).</p>

<h3>Short BIO</h3>
<p>        I was 14 years old when I first took up the camera and I have not put it down ever since.Photography came to be a part of me and the way I see life.The stories I am interested are:people's everyday life,breaking news of the day related to political events,social issues,crisis and war. My work has been acknowledged and published in:The New York Times,The Guardian, TIME, WP, WSJ and etc.My picture was top rated by Magnum Photography Awards 2017</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The story behind the book</h3>
<p>       Four years ago I met Guerassim Dichliev. I knew that he lived in Paris, that he was an actor and worked with Marcel Marceau. I photographed him for the local newspaper, that I worked for. I learned that mime artists were struggling and their shows in Paris were becoming less and less popular, after Marceau's death. I started going to his shows in Bulgaria and France, watched him rehearse and tutor his students in Paris. In this photo book, I am presenting his story and at the same time the story of so many mimes all over the world. For me Pantomime is like the foundation of a building and this building is the life around us. Art is not business. Business in which to invest and expect great profits. </p>
<p>Through this photo book ""The Last(Eternal) Mime"" I want to make the pantomime more understandable as an art form. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Your part: </strong></h2>
<p>       After the photo book ""The Last (Eternal) Mime"" is published  I will organize photo exhibitions in Europe to spread the word and bring light to the problems of Mime artists. I already have arrange that with some renowned galleries that I have worked with before. I also plan to make second edition in which to tell the stories of Mimes from all around the world. To find how this art is changing and to preserve it.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where the money goes:</h3>
<p>I need 3000 euro for publishing the book</p>
<p>I am looking for other sponsors as well, but if I don't reach the amount of 3000 euro, I will publish it on time and you will get your copy, but I may miss the deadlines for arranging some of the exhibitions. </p>

<h3>Help us create a new kind of art.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Imagine a massive canvas -- the largest canvas you've ever seen.</p>
<p>It's made of <strong>hundreds of thousands of tiny LED lights</strong> that are hidden inside <strong>25,000</strong> <strong>magical leaves. </strong>The leaves are connected to an <strong>enormous climbable tree</strong>.</p>
<p>When the sun sets, the leaves begin to glow. Lying beneath the tree, you find yourself looking up at the largest interactive ""light canvas"" in the world, enveloped in colors, shapes and patterns that move to music through the surreal canopy above you.</p>
<p>Instead of giving control of this canvas to a single artist, imagine we put sensors around the tree that empower YOU to control the canopy using your voices, movements, and biorhythms.  </p>
<p>Finally, imagine we <a href=""https://github.com/treeoftenere/Tenere"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">open-sourced the control software</a> so that any artist or technologist around the world could create unforgettable light art for this new medium. </p>
<p><strong>What would happen? What things would you experience under this magical tree of life?</strong></p>
<p>Find out beneath the Tree of Ténéré.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490763690/wqronmcfhyow6094jn8l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our inspiration</h3>
<p>We were inspired by a tree that once grew in the middle of the Sahara desert, in a region called Ténéré. It was the most isolated tree on Earth: not a single other tree could be seen for 250 miles. And yet, the tree became an important ceremonial gathering place for traders and travelers as they crossed the desert. It brought people together for community, ritual and rest.</p>
<p>It was mysteriously destroyed almost 50 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Let's bring this tree back to life.</strong> Let's create a natural space of contemplation, community, creativity, and play. Help us bring Ténéré to Burning Man 2017 and then to cities and festivals around the world.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Come climb...</h3>
<p>Nearly four stories tall, Ténéré lets climbers rekindle their childhood love of adventure and awe for nature.</p>
<p>We designed and engineered Ténéré to support the weight of 60 climbers, with construction already underway in southern California. Made from hand-sculpted fiberglass and hand-painted resin, the bark looks and feels so real you’ll think you’re climbing a living tree.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490763774/hhaiypqyblvphszgsjwh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>...and create</h3>
<p>At night, hidden LEDs within each leaf come to life. The leaves begin to glow. Together, these 25,000 LED leaves form a massive, dome-shaped ""canvas of light.""</p>
<p>Using our open-source tools, artist and technologists around the world are creating experiences for this canvas that you will never forget.</p>
<p>Lying beneath the tree at night, you'll look up and see stunning colors, shapes and patterns move through the treetop in synchrony with soothing music. We’ll host live events as well: imagine a DJ, choir or orchestra up in the tree, controlling the canopy with their music.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490763734/sg9kcvji6z5h0zwecgny.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>At other times, YOU get to control the tree. Hidden sensors and simple wearables let you activate the LED leaves through sound (chanting, humming, singing, words), biorhythms like heartbeat, and movement. Imagine harmonizing with others under the tree or shouting names of colors to create mind-bending patterns. Someone passes you a Fitbit: when you slip it onto your wrist, 25,000 leaves begin pulsing to the beat of your heart.<br/><br/>We're creating this canvas in partnership with the Symmetry Labs team. You have to see their past work to believe it:</p>

<p><strong>ALEX GREEN, CO-LEAD ARTIST &amp; SYMMETRY LABS CEO</strong></p>
<p>My work as an artist and technologist bridges the digital and physical worlds. Before pursuing interactive art I was a physicist and jazz musician; both science and music remain lasting sources of inspiration in my work. I try to push the boundaries of both knowledge and expression through art -- often my projects require technological innovation as well as custom fabrication.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, I've been focused on building modular ""light instruments"": volumetric lighting blocks with sophisticated software that can be played like a musical instrument. My work has been featured in Gizmodo, Creators Project, Discovery Channel’s In The Making, an upcoming PBS documentary on the future of art called Ineffable with violinist Tim Fain, and in music videos for Eric Prydz and Cathedrals. I've done light sculptures for Google, Cisco, Dreamforce, and many others.</p>
<p>I've had the chance to perform at festivals around the world, including the Future of Storytelling, Treasure Island Music Festival, and Cannes Lions Innovation Festival, where I gave the keynote on “Beyond Sound: The Music Experience of the Future”. I'm thrilled to be bringing Ténéré to the world in 2017.</p>

<p>My visual art draws heavily on a background in computer programming. I develop algorithmic patterns inspired both by organic and mathematical process, employing procedural motion, subtle variation, and evolving shifts in form and hue.

For me, Burning Man is an expression of what humanity is capable of, and a reminder for how much stronger we are when we work together then we are divided.

Help us create a new kind of art.
 
Imagine a massive canvas -- the largest canvas you've ever seen.
It's made of hundreds of thousands of tiny LED lights that are hidden inside 25,000 magical leaves. The leaves are connected to an enormous climbable tree.
When the sun sets, the leaves begin to glow. Lying beneath the tree, you find yourself looking up at the largest interactive ""light canvas"" in the world, enveloped in colors, shapes and patterns that move to music through the surreal canopy above you.
Instead of giving control of this canvas to a single artist, imagine we put sensors around the tree that empower YOU to control the canopy using your voices, movements, and biorhythms.  
Finally, imagine we open-sourced the control software so that any artist or technologist around the world could create unforgettable light art for this new medium. 
What would happen? What things would you experience under this magical tree of life?
Find out beneath the Tree of Ténéré.  


 
Our inspiration
We were inspired by a tree that once grew in the middle of the Sahara desert, in a region called Ténéré. It was the most isolated tree on Earth: not a single other tree could be seen for 250 miles. And yet, the tree became an important ceremonial gathering place for traders and travelers as they crossed the desert. It brought people together for community, ritual and rest.
It was mysteriously destroyed almost 50 years ago.
Let's bring this tree back to life. Let's create a natural space of contemplation, community, creativity, and play. Help us bring Ténéré to Burning Man 2017 and then to cities and festivals around the world.

Come climb...
Nearly four stories tall, Ténéré lets climbers rekindle their childhood love of adventure and awe for nature.
We designed and engineered Ténéré to support the weight of 60 climbers, with construction already underway in southern California. Made from hand-sculpted fiberglass and hand-painted resin, the bark looks and feels so real you’ll think you’re climbing a living tree.



...and create
At night, hidden LEDs within each leaf come to life. The leaves begin to glow. Together, these 25,000 LED leaves form a massive, dome-shaped ""canvas of light.""
Using our open-source tools, artist and technologists around the world are creating experiences for this canvas that you will never forget.
Lying beneath the tree at night, you'll look up and see stunning colors, shapes and patterns move through the treetop in synchrony with soothing music. We’ll host live events as well: imagine a DJ, choir or orchestra up in the tree, controlling the canopy with their music.
At other times, YOU get to control the tree. Hidden sensors and simple wearables let you activate the LED leaves through sound (chanting, humming, singing, words), biorhythms like heartbeat, and movement. Imagine harmonizing with others under the tree or shouting names of colors to create mind-bending patterns. Someone passes you a Fitbit: when you slip it onto your wrist, 25,000 leaves begin pulsing to the beat of your heart.We're creating this canvas in partnership with the Symmetry Labs team. You have to see their past work to believe it:

ALEX GREEN, CO-LEAD ARTIST & SYMMETRY LABS CEO
My work as an artist and technologist bridges the digital and physical worlds. Before pursuing interactive art I was a physicist and jazz musician; both science and music remain lasting sources of inspiration in my work. I try to push the boundaries of both knowledge and expression through art -- often my projects require technological innovation as well as custom fabrication.
Over the last few years, I've been focused on building modular ""light instruments"": volumetric lighting blocks with sophisticated software that can be played like a musical instrument. My work has been featured in Gizmodo, Creators Project, Discovery Channel’s In The Making, an upcoming PBS documentary on the future of art called Ineffable with violinist Tim Fain, and in music videos for Eric Prydz and Cathedrals. I've done light sculptures for Google, Cisco, Dreamforce, and many others.
I've had the chance to perform at festivals around the world, including the Future of Storytelling, Treasure Island Music Festival, and Cannes Lions Innovation Festival, where I gave the keynote on “Beyond Sound: The Music Experience of the Future”. I'm thrilled to be bringing Ténéré to the world in 2017.

<p>I started my animation career in 2002. I started in commercials as a freelancer. Eventually, I started to direct projects and one of my side hobbies was to tell stories. I was enjoying explaining and sketching the details of those worlds.</p>
<p>While technology became more accessible, I got to experience virtual reality, and I discovered that this was always the way I was imagining my stories. I decided to experiment on that, and how to bring the environment as a plot player. I got to do my Animation Masters about ""Storytelling in Virtual Reality."" Soon enough, an incomplete real story kept coming to me through news, through memories from back home, through experiences. I came to the USA from Egypt. I got the chance to create animation over here, and back home I remember refugees,  homeless families, and their stories. And I felt maybe I got the chance to tell what are their real stories aside from any news and directed media. While elders were traumatized by what happened to them, kids' worlds were full of hope to go back and to live again the happy life they barely had.</p>
<p>From that, I got the idea of creating a split virtual world that tells the story of this homeless kid that lost everything, yet she still has hope. Audiences get to know that she is determined about that, but it takes more than just happy thoughts to achieve her goal.</p>
<p>In this project, it is important to me and to my team to do more than just an entertaining piece, or another virtual reality cool project. It is about a humanistic message. It is about standing for peace. It is about being in the experience of those victims, and more than just a detached look to their environment. Therefore, we want you to help us finish the project and reach as many people as we can so that we can use this project to actually establish a very basic decent life for those innocent kids.</p>

<p>We now have so much done in the production. Many shots of animation are done; environment texturing is coming along. Visual effects are happening as much as many other things. We are going to use your donations and help for:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to get fulltime talents for cloth and hair simulations.</li>
<li>We need to get texturing artists for the character look developmentand some parts of the environment.</li>
<li>We will need to rent equipment software and talents for post production and compositing.</li>
<li>We need to buy oriental specific music licenses that work with the environment.</li>
<li>We need to push things faster through our team to get things done quickly. This includes expenses from studio rents, upgrading equipment, and software licenses.</li>
<li>And the most important part is the rendering cost through render farms. </li>
<li>Some of those expenses will be spent on the production of perks you get.</li>
<li>We will need to rent space for the show.</li>
</ul>
<p>These costs are very expensive, and we need your help to achieve them. While our initial aim is $10,000, there are 4 stages of our actual aim:</p>
<p>Stage 1: $7,000 This barely can get us to render in a decent render farm.</p>
<p>Stage 2: $10,000 This is enough to render, to get the music license, rent the space, and pay some of the expenses.</p>
<p>Stage 3: $15,000 This will be enough to cover all our expenses, and to get a decent and fast rendering for our project.</p>
<p>Stage 4: $15,000+ This will be enough to apply for festivals and to show the project to as many people as we can.</p>

I started in commercials as a freelancer. Eventually, I started to direct projects and one of my side hobbies was to tell stories. I was enjoying explaining and sketching the details of those worlds.
While technology became more accessible, I got to experience virtual reality, and I discovered that this was always the way I was imagining my stories. I decided to experiment on that, and how to bring the environment as a plot player. I got to do my Animation Masters about ""Storytelling in Virtual Reality."" Soon enough, an incomplete real story kept coming to me through news, through memories from back home, through experiences. I came to the USA from Egypt. I got the chance to create animation over here, and back home I remember refugees,  homeless families, and their stories. And I felt maybe I got the chance to tell what are their real stories aside from any news and directed media. While elders were traumatized by what happened to them, kids' worlds were full of hope to go back and to live again the happy life they barely had.
From that, I got the idea of creating a split virtual world that tells the story of this homeless kid that lost everything, yet she still has hope. Audiences get to know that she is determined about that, but it takes more than just happy thoughts to achieve her goal.
In this project, it is important to me and to my team to do more than just an entertaining piece, or another virtual reality cool project. It is about a humanistic message. It is about standing for peace. It is about being in the experience of those victims, and more than just a detached look to their environment. Therefore, we want you to help us finish the project and reach as many people as we can so that we can use this project to actually establish a very basic decent life for those innocent kids.


We now have so much done in the production. Many shots of animation are done; environment texturing is coming along. Visual effects are happening as much as many other things. We are going to use your donations and help for:

We need to get fulltime talents for cloth and hair simulations.
We need to get texturing artists for the character look developmentand some parts of the environment.
We will need to rent equipment software and talents for post production and compositing.
We need to buy oriental specific music licenses that work with the environment.
We need to push things faster through our team to get things done quickly. This includes expenses from studio rents, upgrading equipment, and software licenses.
And the most important part is the rendering cost through render farms. 
Some of those expenses will be spent on the production of perks you get.
We will need to rent space for the show.

These costs are very expensive, and we need your help to achieve them. While our initial aim is $10,000, there are 4 stages of our actual aim:
Stage 1: $7,000 This barely can get us to render in a decent render farm.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are two painters and illustrators from Montreal, we are fortunate to live in a city that inspires us and is full of art opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>About the project</strong><br/>We have been painting since ... we could say forever, but decided to team up to create a bigger project and grow. That's why we are in the midst of creating an exhibition project that will take place in July. Our exhibition will talk about the culture from here, the culture of Quebec, about its history, its nature, its language. We will explore the same topics, but interpreted by our two completely different styles. We were fortunate to be selected to receive a grant from the Quebec government through the Young Volunteers program. That's why we now have a studio where we can fully create. We just need a little help to keep the studio till June, but more importantly for the gallery fees.</p>
<p><strong>This project is really important</strong> for us because it is the first time we have the chance to do a bigger project and it will help us to get our name out there and hopefully open doors to more projects. It's really thanks to your help if we can continue.</p>
<p>We appreciate your support and your concern. Your support will make this exhibition happen. If you have any questions, please contact us.</p>
<p><strong>To support us</strong> it's super simple you can buy our promotional items or simply make a donation.</p>
<p>***Every kind of help is welcome (materials, contacts, tips, exchanges, etc.) </p>
<p>We promise you an unforgettable experience at our exhibition in Montreal.</p>
<p>And we hope to see you in July!</p>

<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>My name is Christian Stavrakis, and I'm a sculptor. I'm also the Chief Creative Officer of Cryptic Pictures, an independent film production &amp; distribution company based in Pittsburgh and Maryland. My love of film - and eventually other forms of artistic expression - is an outgrowth of my youthful obsession with the works of one man: <strong>George A. Romero</strong>.</p>
<p>George is the reason I wanted to make films in the first place. He's the reason I live in Pittsburgh today. He was my inspiration to CREATE.</p>
<p>My brother Taso worked on some of George's films, and I was lucky enough to have visited the sets of <i>Knightriders</i> and <i>Day of the Dead</i> during their production. On both occasions I saw an incredible thing at work: I saw a group of unknown, non-Hollywood filmmakers working very hard to fulfill the vision of a man they obviously loved...a big, gentle Teddy bear of a man who clearly loved them too. You could <u><i>feel</i></u> it, like an invisible web of happiness binding these people together as they made these films off the map and under the radar.</p>
<p>The world lost a great creative soul on July 16th, 2017...and it's time this man was honored in Pittsburgh with a proper, respectful memorial to his zeal, humor, and independent spirit. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Pittsburgh now has a bustling film community, but it all started with George and his band of merry men at the Latent Image (and later, Laurel Tape and Film).</span></p>
<p>This year marks the 40th anniversary of the production of <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> at the <strong>Monroeville Mall</strong> in Monroeville, PA (about 14 miles east of downtown Pittsburgh). The Mall has long been a destination for fans of George's work from all over the world, and now - with the blessing of the Mall's management - a permanent memorial to George may be installed, in the form of a bronze portrait bust sculpted by myself and sponsored by Cryptic Pictures, a company which wouldn't exist without his inspiration.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>We need to raise $18,000 to make this happen. This goes towards the creation and production of the bust itself (both in materials and sculpture), the purchase of supplies for same (as well as supplies for the various incentive products we'll be crafting in the weeks to come), a proper pedestal and accompanying bronze plaque for the memorial display, shipping of the incentive goods, reimbursement for work done and materials purchased, and various and sundry other expenses as yet unforeseen.</p>
<p>The incentives will include exclusive t-shirts, commemorative posters and postcards, a 1/3 scale version of the George bust, reproductions of the famous ashtray prop from <i>Creepshow</i>, DVDs of our own film <i>Mortal Remains</i> (which features many alumni from George's films), and a few other fun things.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>George's Legacy:</h3>
<p>Why install a bust of George at a shopping mall? If you have to ask...you didn't know George.</p>
<p><i>Dawn of the Dead</i> was pooh-poohed at the time of its release by self-important critics who sniffed at its ""thinly-veiled jab at consumerism."" The cream always rises; as time has marched on, <i>Dawn</i> has come to be recognized as one of the most significant American films of the 20th century, genre trappings notwithstanding.</p>
<p>I've sculpted George as he appeared on Press Night in January, 1978. See the big grin on his face? That grin was the precursor to what I thought of as George's Tom Bombadil laugh, a great, hearty roar that seemed to emanate from the very ground beneath his feet.</p>
<p>Now imagine George's glee at being honored exactly where, 40 years ago, he staged a pie fight... (<i>Here comes that big laugh...!)</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge is that the clock is ticking. After I began sculpting in February, it occurred to me that the perfect event for the dedication of such a tribute was only a few months away. Our goal is to unveil and dedicate the bust and memorial at the <strong>Living Dead Weekend</strong> festival on the weekend of June 8th-10th. And it's already May...</p>
<p>The bust is under construction, but the rest needs to come together quickly! This 30-day campaign will end on June 6th, which is my 47th birthday. The dedication MUST take place that weekend.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>SPREAD THE WORD! Even if you can't afford to contribute to the fund, please post, write, tweet, share photos! George deserves a lot more local recognition than our little project (a bridge named after him would be swell), but this is a start...it's the first public memorial to the man and his contributions to local history and the world of film.</p>
<p>And YOU can help make it happen!</p>

(Terrifying only in the power we may harness for our selves and others)It’s time for you to become the monster you want to see in the world. WHAT YOU ARE FUNDING:I am setting myself a modest bare-minimum goal of $1000.  This will cover the costs of the printing & distribution of the portraits, as well as paying for location, equipment, and assistance for the photo shoot. The funding will also cover additional baggage costs for transporting my Obleng monster from Australia to Canada, as well and bringing the monsters I currently have in Canada back to Australia. WHAT YOU ARE GETTING:Those who are physically able to attend the photo portraits will receive a physical print of their portrait: one 5”x7” and five 2”x”3s.  You have the option to pose as the Obleng Monster (alone or with human friends) OR as an Obleng Monster with Wat.  You may donate/sign up for multiple portraits (one portrait per min. $25 donation; limit of 75 portraits total).Additionally, for those who would like to participate in this monstrosity but are unable to physically attend, there are some physical perks to donating: a pack of 4”x6” prints of the original ‘I AM A MONSTER’ photo series (no quantity limit), a hand made one of a kind monster eye brooch/pin (limit of 50), and the “ultimate” perk of your very own custom monster plush (as well as aforementioned physical perks). GOING BEYOND:If, as I very much hope, I am able to raise more than my $1000 goal, this is what the additional money will enable me to do:+$2000will cover my regular living expenses (rent/bills) while I am off/out of work (away from Australia and in Canada for 6-8 weeks).  Additionally, it will enable me to apply for/attend the Toronto Makers Festival, which takes place the first weekend in July (the weekend before the photo shoots).  At the festival, I plan to have all of my monsters, as well as the prototypes I have built and tested while making them.  It would be an opportunity for me to share with the public how I make these creatures with accessible materials and tools.+$3000ADDITIONAL PHOTO SHOOT LOCATION: MONTREAL!  Getting to/above this amount will allow me to add an additional photo shoot opportunity, located in Montreal! This amount will also enable me to take additional narrative based photos of these monsters.  Ideas have already been brewing: you know, just casual daily life, like at the hair dresser’s and dog park. +4000I would be able to develop and print a monster “yearbook”: a collection of all the portraits I’ve taken (Melbourne, Toronto & Montreal), along with the narrative based photos of the monsters. +5000I’LL MAKE A WHOLE NEW MONSTER FOR YOU.Yes, a whole new monster character to join the family, and for you to become. Please donate what you can, and share it with anyone & everyone you think would want to participate.  I love doing this work, and sharing it with others, and I’m excited for this opportunity to continue to grow this family of monsters.Follow the monstrous journey:on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/elijatude/on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/elijatude/",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The story</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Lorelai, a jewellery designer based in Reading. I currently offer all of my designs in custom colours as I love giving my customers the chance to be involved in the process and come up with their own combinations! I have been able to do that this past year because I became a member of a community run Hackspace which has a laser cutter amongst a variety of other tools and machines.</p>
<p>However, I will be relocating to Sheffield soon in search of a life filled with more art, music, culture and creative friends and in order to be able to continue to provide the bespoke service that my customers love, I will need to buy my own laser cutter.</p>
<p>That is where you come in! If you purchase a piece from this campaign, you will be helping me live my dream of spreading colour and joy around the world with my jewellery!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The laser cutter</h3>
<p>I need a minimum of £5000 to be able to purchase a laser cutter; however the more I can raise, the better laser I can buy! I already have an entire rainbow of acrylic sheets in stock but I will need to purchase more in order to make all of your perks. I do have a some money in savings to out towards this.</p>
<p>I polled my customers to see if they would prefer the campaign perks to be exclusives or items that they would be able to purchase later on and it was a fifty fifty split! So there are a few designs which you can only buy in this campaign, such as the amazing glittery firework necklace and other such as the psychedelic flower earrings that will be made a permanent item in my shop. </p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I will have to use some to get your perks made with a laser cutting service (Yeah Laser) and the rest will be squirreled away in savings until I can raise enough for the laser.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to contribute, please help me spread the word by telling your friends and family about me and my business!</p>

<h3>Newark Print Shop</h3>
<p>Newark Print Shop (NPS) is a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to promoting the fine art of printmaking by providing a vibrant learning community and access to professional equipment and facilities. The shop incubates artistic expression through education, while simultaneously creating workspace opportunities for shop members and artists in our community. </p>
<p>In 2012, artist and educator Lisa Conrad founded Newark Print Shop.  Her vision was to create a place where artists could work side by side, share and create together.  She turned her tiny downtown artist studio, which she paid a mere $187/mo, into a communal space, and invited artists to gather around her printing press and create together. Newark Print Shop was born!</p>
<p>6 years later, NPS continues to be a space for artists and has grown into a vibrant hub for community engagement and arts education for people of all ages and abilities to create, engaging with thousands of artists, entrepreneurs, students, and community members annually:</p>
<ul>
<li>1,603 K-12 STUDENTS: art education programs</li>
<li>226 STUDENTS: adult education printmaking classes</li>
<li>547 RECEPTION ATTENDEES: fine art print exhibitions</li>
<li>1,600 PARTICIPANTS: live printing and public programs</li>
<li>1,955 PARTICIPANTS: print club open studio access</li>
<li>15 ARTISTS: teaching artists employed</li>
<li>50 SCHOOLS: community partners engaging in our art ed programs</li>
</ul>
<p>On January 5, 2019, our contract for our current space at Express Newark in Hahne &amp; Co. expires, and sadly we do not have the option to renew and stay. While we are uncertain of our new address, it is exceedingly clear that there is a need for NPS to continue to serve the community and its artists whose desire is to create, educate, and showcase their craft.</p>

After leaving Hollywood and moving to Ojai, I became restless. One day I looked around at the diverse oddities I had gathered over the years on movie locations, junk stores, and flea markets. These found objects all seemed to stare at me and say “Okay, you got us here. Now what?”</p><p>I started to see connections and put things together in what I came to learn was “assemblage”.

Although I never knew of him previously, I found myself crawling into Cornellian boxes.

Most of my adult life has been spent creating projects that say “I’m here, if just for a short time.” Surely ego/vanity play their  mischievous parts, but discounting those two nuisances, there is a deeper universal need to create something that says “I was here and I had something to say.” As Lord Buckley put it, to “…stomp the terra!”</p><p>My particular mode of expression often involves humor. But it is humor I take seriously. In my work and titles, I strive to create and share a spark of recognition with my audience that says “Right. I get that.”</p><p>But what is “that”?

This is an unique opportunity to see these two artistic visions in one coherent show.We are seeking to raise $8500 to make and promote this exhibit. Please consider helping us realize our vision by watching the video and clicking the link below. And we hope to see you at Actual Reality.MEET THE ARTISTSPETER FOXAfter graduating from Harvard with a concentration in primate anthropology, I spent many years roaming the jungles of Los Angeles acting on stage and screen, producing, writing screenplays, and directing plays. After leaving Hollywood and moving to Ojai, I became restless. One day I looked around at the diverse oddities I had gathered over the years on movie locations, junk stores, and flea markets. These found objects all seemed to stare at me and say “Okay, you got us here. Now what?”I started to see connections and put things together in what I came to learn was “assemblage”. I was suddenly in a realm where 2 + 2 equals many things other than 4.Who inspires my brand of art? “Ballard Street” cartoonist Jerry Van Amerongen is an insightful, hilarious, and soulful navigator. Although I never knew of him previously, I found myself crawling into Cornellian boxes. Marcel Duchamp, I have to believe, was chuckling inside when he hung his urinal.  And Kris Kuksi, Gerard Cambon, Carlos Grasso, Ron Robertson, and Ted Gall all push me to go further.Peter Fox Art StatementHere’s what I’ve learned --Art is everywhere, in everything. Believe it.What is the thread that led me to art?“I’m here!”Yet I know someday I won’t be. Most of my adult life has been spent creating projects that say “I’m here, if just for a short time.” Surely ego/vanity play their  mischievous parts, but discounting those two nuisances, there is a deeper universal need to create something that says “I was here and I had something to say.” As Lord Buckley put it, to “…stomp the terra!”My particular mode of expression often involves humor. But it is humor I take seriously. In my work and titles, I strive to create and share a spark of recognition with my audience that says “Right. I get that.”But what is “that”? For me, it is how we are all trying desperately to navigate the complex absurdity of quotidian existence…with mixed results.Creating these pieces gives me great pleasure, and like all the other creative projects I’ve done in my life, they flow out of me on their own accord.It’s child’s play.

<h3>WE NEED YOUR HELP!</h3>
<p>Earlier this year, we were awarded an art grant from YOUTopia, an arts &amp; music festival that happens every year in San Diego. We were lucky enough to be one of only 2-3 projects that were awarded their largest art grant, and it gave us a strong foundation to start making things happen. However, it's only a portion of the funds we need and as artists, we're expected to raise the remaining funds and complete the project. We love this for a few reasons (mainly because it encourages us to engage with our communities in exciting ways), but it also presents some obvious challenges, as it takes us away from the very thing we were commissioned to do, which is to make art.</p>
<p>We're looking to raise $2,000 to cover the costs of purchasing materials, machine rentals/shop space, the time of some very skilled programmers and technicians as well as the costs of transporting ma8nanimous to YOUTopia.</p>
<p><strong>YOUTopia is just the beginning!</strong> This is a project that will grow, change and take on all kinds of new dimensions as it travels to different festivals, public spaces and communities. Even if you can not attend YOUTopia, your donation helps us get ma8nanimous <strong>closer to you!</strong></p>
